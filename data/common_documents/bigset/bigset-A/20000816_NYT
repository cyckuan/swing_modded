DEMOCRATS FACE LEFT TO APPEASE LIBERAL WING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Mass., Mich., Ark., Minn., D.C.)   (Eds.: UPDATES to add Jackson's speech, background on Lieberman's
meeting with Waters, 2nd take of new material; no pickup.)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Faced with an undercurrent of grumbling about the
centrist tone of its ticket and platform, the Democratic Party
devoted much of its convention Tuesday to reassuring its liberal
base, sending its vice-presidential candidate, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, before black delegates to declare his unequivocal
support for affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was for affirmative action, am for affirmative action and
will be for affirmative action,'' Lieberman, who has been critical
of racial preference programs, told the convention's Black Caucus.
Immediately afterward, Rep. Maxine Waters of Los Angeles, who had
voiced strong doubts about Lieberman this weekend, declared she
would support him wholeheartedly.
</P>
<P>
   But other leading liberals continued to express doubts about
Gore himself. ``The most important thing to me is that Gore is not
emotionally in touch with the party's base,'' Mayor Willie Brown of
San Francisco said in an interview. ``If he's smart, he'll go to a
black church every Sunday from now until Election Day.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to gauge the depth of discontent among black
voters, union members and other core Democrats with the ticket and
its agenda. But Gore's selection of Lieberman, a Connecticut
senator who has staked out centrist positions not only on
affirmative action, but also on school vouchers, military spending
and Social Security, seems to have crystallized their worries that
Gore is taking them for granted.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign moved swiftly Tuesday to address worries
within the party, not only through Lieberman's appearance before
the Black Caucus, but also by dispatching two black Cabinet
secretaries, Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater and Labor
Secretary Alexis Herman, and other prominent black Democrats to
declare their strong support.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the list of convention speakers Tuesday night
was almost a Who's Who of leaders from the party's liberal wing,
including two union presidents, a prominent environmentalist, gay
rights and abortion rights leaders, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Jackson alluded to the party's fault lines,
saying, ``Within our party we can fight for the right to do what's
right. We can change, we can challenge, we can agree to disagree,
we can agree to be agreeable. But we are family.''
</P>
<P>
   Discontent among core Democrats poses a potentially significant
problem for Gore because black voters and union members are among
the party's largest and most loyal constituencies. And while some
of those voters might defect to Ralph Nader, the Green Party
candidate, the Democrats' greater fear is that some base voters
will stay home on Election Day, making it difficult to win swing
states like Michigan and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are saying, `We don't see the Democrats standing for
us,''' said Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, a leader of the
party's liberal wing. ``It is a hurdle to overcome. And the vice
president needs to do it soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' liberal lineup represented a sharp contrast from
the Republicans, who carefully choreographed their convention two
weeks ago to keep conservative activists backstage, making it
easier for their presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush, to
reach out to moderate swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   But many Democrats say that the Republicans appeased their core
voters in other ways: with the party platform, which remains
staunchly conservative on issues like abortion, gay rights and
military spending, and in the selection of Dick Cheney, who
compiled a consistently conservative record in Congress, as the
vice-presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Gore reached toward the political center with his
selection of Lieberman, a leader of the party's centrist ``New
Democrat'' wing. And his aides rebuffed repeated efforts by
liberals to insert language into the platform calling for universal
health care, cuts in defense spending, a moratorium on capital
punishment and increased spending on the poor.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign's efforts Tuesday to reassure black delegates
about Lieberman's record took place in typical Democratic fashion
amid public displays of discontent and ego politics.
</P>
<P>
   His comments to black delegates were prompted, for the most
part, by Waters' decision to voice her concerns about his record in
public forums on both Sunday and Monday. Shortly after she showed
up for Tuesday morning's caucus meeting at the Westin Bonaventure
Hotel, she was cornered by Herman, one of the Gore campaign's
leading emissaries to black Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Standing nearly nose-to-nose with Waters, who had her back to a
ballroom door, Herman began laying out the case for Lieberman until
aides realized the scene was being watched by reporters. They then
ushered the two women into the closed ballroom. When Lieberman
arrived to address the caucus, he was brought into a backstage
holding room to personally address Waters' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   As he did, Slater was speaking to the caucus members and
crediting Lieberman for voting against a 1998 Republican amendment
aimed at ending a federal program that reserves a portion of
highway spending for minority-owned firms. Then Eleanor Holmes
Norton, the delegate from the District of Columbia, vouched for his
civil rights credentials.
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledged that they had occasional policy differences,
but said they were ``overwhelmed by the many things we have in
common.'' And she said that President Clinton, who also embraced a
centrist agenda, had taught her how to live with disagreements
within the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, if you're with me most of the time, you my man,'' she
said. ``Don't go too far now. But if you're with me most of the
time, you the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Lieberman took the stage to a prolonged standing ovation
from the black delegates. After leading the crowd in singing a
round of ``Happy Birthday'' to Waters, he told of his religious
belief that ``every human being is created in God's image'' and
recounted his participation in the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr.'s 1963 March on Washington and in Mississippi voter
registration drives. He dropped the names of civil rights leaders
and said that equal opportunity was ``the most fundamental
principle of American life.''
</P>
<P>
   That being said, he joked that the recent scrutiny given to his
every past word and vote was ``like having a medical procedure
without an anesthetic.''
</P>
<P>
   That record includes comments he reportedly made in 1995 that
affirmative action programs that reward people strictly because of
race or gender were ``patently unfair.'' He also was quoted then as
saying, ``You can't defend policies that are based on group
preferences as opposed to individual opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   And when asked his views on California's Proposition 209, which
banned state-financed affirmative action programs, Lieberman
reportedly said, ``I can't see how I could be opposed to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, when Clinton proposed his ``mend it, don't end
it'' approach to tinkering with affirmative action, Lieberman
supported the initiative in a speech on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after Gore selected Lieberman last week,
campaign aides began explaining those stands to minority group
leaders. Just hours after word of the decision leaked on Aug. 7,
they arranged a conference call between Lieberman and leading
blacks in Congress. Waters did not participate in the call.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Tuesday, Lieberman said that he had been troubled by
racial quotas but had supported affirmative action ``because
history and current reality make it necessary.'' He noted that he
had declined a request for a letter stating his support for
Proposition 209 and had voted against two Senate measures that
would have eliminated federal affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding vouchers, Lieberman said, as he has repeatedly in the
last week, that he supported pilot programs aimed at providing
alternatives for children in failing schools. But he added that he
strongly supported public education and Gore's spending proposals
to reduce class sizes.
</P>
<P>
   After Lieberman's speech, Waters said that she would now feel
comfortable supporting and campaigning for the Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democratic officials are particularly concerned that Gore's
centrist agenda will dampen enthusiasm in swing states where a
large turnout of blacks, who were Clinton's most loyal supporters
during impeachment, and other core Democrats is vital. That agenda
includes staunch support for global trade and the death penalty,
increased military spending, an incremental approach to expanding
health coverage and a focus on using the federal surplus for debt
reduction, more than on expanding social programs.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, the party's progressive leaders said they planned
to work hard for Gore's election. But their concerns about how the
ticket is playing among rank-and-file Democrats were expressed in
their tendency to focus on the perils of a Bush victory more than
on the benefits of a Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   But some liberals said a campaign built mainly on raising fears
about the Republicans would fail to win over independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just conveys the idea that this is a lesser-of-two-evils
election,'' said Tom Hayden, a state Senator from California and a
Gore delegate. ``My recommendation is to reach out to the Nader
constituency instead of trying to become more Republican. The
Democrats are Republican enough.''

HALL THRIVING WITH NEW OUTLOOK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The black leather motorcycle pants are gone,
replaced by a black terry cloth robe. Gary Hall Jr.'s habit has
changed and so have his habits. The madcap kid of four years ago
has become much more sedate. He has stripped his life down to its
skivvies.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetes can do that to a dude. Hall, 25, discovered he had the
blood-sugar disorder in March of 1999. The diagnosis forced Hall to
seriously consider the consequences of his actions, something he
wasn't wont to do in his wild-child days when he was carving donuts
on a golf course in a car or smoking marijuana (he served a
three-month swimming suspension in 1998 after testing positive for
the substance) or tuning out the world to the strains of the
Grateful Dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was invincible before,'' Hall said. ``Finding out
I had diabetes was a real shock. It gave me a taste of mortality.
That can be a very sobering experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Through insolence and insulin injections, one thing never
changed: Hall always has been able to haul butt in the water.
</P>
<P>
   A second-place finish in the 100 freestyle on Sunday put Hall on
his second Olympic team. His swim Tuesday in the 50-meter freestyle
at the U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials punctuated his revival
emphatically.
</P>
<P>
   Hall broke Tom Jager's 10-year-old American record in the
one-lap sprint by .05 seconds with a 21.76 clocking at the IUPUI
Natatorium. His training partner, Hart High graduate Anthony Ervin,
also finished under Jager's record at 21.80 to qualify to swim the
event at the Sydney Games next month.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's time was the fastest recorded in an eight-man final;
Russia's Alexander Popov set the world record of 21.64 in an
individual time trial. Hall didn't believe the timing of his record
swim was a coincidence; he'd like to think his standing up to
diabetes was what ultimately made surpassing Jager's record
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There the saying that what doesn't kill you makes you
stronger,'' Hall said. ``Maybe what I've been through has made me
stronger. Maybe that's why I was able to break this record.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 Hall got a lot of press because he was the Steve
Prefontaine of swimming; a free spirit in a regimented sport that
spits out in cookie-cutter fashion the quiet, clean-cut and
uncontroversial types _ athletes not unlike Gary Hall Sr., who won
three medals at three Olympics, then became a model husband, father
and dentist.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Jr. made headlines because he was his father's son in the
pool and his father's diametrical opposite out of it.
</P>
<P>
   That made for good copy then, but now we find Hall infinitely
more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   His antics these days are largely confined to shadow boxing an
imaginary adversary before stepping to the blocks for his race. We
trust that's so. Because the truth is, Hall is sparring every day
with an opportunistic opponent that is not above throwing the
occasional sucker punch.
</P>
<P>
   Hall has to stay on his toes _ and toe the line. Failure to do
so could result in the loss of limb or even life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness and amputation and
one of the leading causes of heart disease,'' Hall said, slipping a
public service announcement into his postrace interviews. ``That's
in the back of my mind. That's a motivating factor to take care of
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Every day Hall checks his blood-sugar levels as often as a
bodybuilder checks his physique in the gym mirror. Some days, the
lean, 6-foot-6 swimmer said, he has to give himself as many as
eight injections of insulin to maintain an energy equilibrium that
most of the rest of us take for granted.
</P>
<P>
   As Hall has said, diabetes is not a disease that can be cured.
At best, it can be contained. Hall is wed to diabetes for the rest
of his life, which is an awfully scary commitment for somebody his
age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who goes through as much as I've gone through the last
four years is going to (emerge from the experience) different,''
Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall doesn't see anything the same anymore. How could he? The
ambivalence he once used to have about swimming and his place in it
is as yesterday as Jager's record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have a better understanding of what the Olympics is
and the importance of it,'' Hall said. ``I may be a little more
appreciative of the experience this time around.''
</P>
<P>
   It bugs him that people may see him the same as they always
have, as the guy blessed with his father's Olympic genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of resentful about the whole talent thing,'' Hall
said. ``People take it too far and expect me to be a great swimmer
just because my father was. I've been working hard just like
everyone else who made the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Given what he has gone through the past 16 months, the very
least that can be said of Hall is he has toughness to match his
talent. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A medium offering music videos, news, cartoons and
animated series sounds like television -- but comes over another
screen in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the era of the Web as freestanding entertainment
source and the gradual removal of the division between the living
room and the computer room.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the ``webisodes'' created by Brilliant Digital
Entertainment that could be coming soon to a television station
near you.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least to that television station's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In a recently announced deal, a division of USA Networks will
syndicate the Woodland Hills company's animated feature series
based on such television shows as ``Xena: Warrior Princess.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This continues to bring together television and Web-based
resources,'' said Brilliant vice president of marketing and
communications Mary Lou Hotsko. ``It continues to expand our
syndication model.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts consider Brilliant one of the few companies
successfully finding a market for entertainment specifically meant
for Web users. The San Fernando Valley, however, features a growing
number of entertainment content producers making ``convergence'' a
common buzzword.
</P>
<P>
   The new genre has mostly seen failure -- witness the stumbling
Pop.com, an online film site that has had no product since its
October launch, despite the backing of studio giants like Steven
Spielberg -- but that doesn't stop content producers from trying.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Glendale's entertaindom.com launched an all-online
mock campaign ``Duke2000,'' a bid by the ``Doonesbury'' comic strip
character for the presidency. At the end of February, Burbank-based
FMiTV launched KIISFMi.com, a Web site based on the Los Angeles
radio station offering original programming, music and the latest
dance steps. Crucial to both is interaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's supposed to be a two-way environment,'' said FMiTV
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Laurence Norjean. ``Let the
Web be what it's supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   In FMiTV's case, Norjean said sites like his are the first
places most people will see Web and television entertainment start
to blur. Kids will ``watch'' TV on their computer screens first,
but inevitably, their TV screens will carry Internet programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Web-based entertainment is in transition to become iTV,'' said
Norjean.
</P>
<P>
   But before it becomes commonplace, Web entertainment players and
analysts say streaming, the solution to herky-jerky Internet video,
must improve. Web entertainment companies also must retain ties
with traditional entertainment producers like television networks,
movie studios and radio stations. Duke's campaign adventures are
all available on the Web, for example, but he'll also appear on
``Larry King Live'' and on syndicated radio talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good entertainment is good entertainment,'' said Damon
Danielson, whose company, Dotcomix, is jointly distributing the
Duke2000 site with Entertaindom. ``It can come from a number of
sources.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bills, an editor following entertainment and information
for Web-based analyst Hoovers Online, says the Studios USA deal is
the kind that keeps the 4-year-old Brilliant going.
</P>
<P>
   Studios USA will sell webisodes, centered on such characters as
Xena, the rock band KISS or movie character Ace Ventura to Web
sites operated by television stations in 220 markets around the
country. In Los Angeles, for example, the animated shows could
appear on the Web site operated by KTLA-TV (Channel 5), where the
televised version of Xena airs currently, said company officials.
</P>
<P>
   Brilliant also has distribution agreements with entertainment
conglomerate Time Warner and cable music channel VH-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think where Brilliant Digital has a leg up is that they have
very, very familiar characters and they've really been helped by
all these high-profile distribution agreements,'' said Bills.
</P>
<P>
   Norjean thinks the future of Web entertainment will require it
to offer more variety than mere TV shows modified for the Web. He
agrees, however, that Brilliant's ties with old school
entertainment are necessary -- for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can hear about it on TV, or in a magazine, or radio,
that's what's going to make people go to it,'' he said. ``You're
not on the Web until you turn on your computer.''

SENATOR, ACLU BLAST POLICE

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Claiming hundreds of innocent demonstrators were
injured by police during a melee outside Staples Center, state Sen.
Tom Hayden and American Civil Liberties Union officials on Tuesday
called for an independent investigation of the LAPD's
``orchestrated riot'' against protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden, who said son Troy was among the injured, was joined in
his call for an investigation by D2KLA protest leaders and the
American Civil Liberties Union, which condemned the Los Angeles
Police Department's ``incredibly poor judgment.'' The ACLU is
planning to sue the city Wednesday over the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that the investigation will show there are
hundreds of people who are victims of last night's arsenal of
exotic weaponry that the police and security forces wanted to use
experimentally, psychologically and physically against
demonstrators,'' said Hayden, a Los Angeles Democrat who was one of
the ``Chicago Seven'' defendants after the violent clashes of the
1968 Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden said his son was hit during by a rubber bullet during
Monday night's melee. He also said he believes police used various
kinds of new gas weapons, adding that the type of pepper spray
police said they were using can damage the nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be evidence that hundreds of people who
were treated medically and hundreds of people who will give
affidavits as to what happened,'' Hayden said.
</P>
<P>
   Cmdr. David Kalish, the LAPD's lead spokesman, said there was no
new type of gas or pepper spray used.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unfortunate that some politicos have escalated the level
of the rhetoric and participated in the dissemination of
disinformation,'' Kalish said.
</P>
<P>
   Police cleared the Rage Against the Machine concert outside the
Democratic National Convention in Staples Center on Monday night
with officers on horseback wielding batons and other officers
firing pepper spray and rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Kalish said protesters threw chunks of concrete, metal poles,
bottles containing caustic chemicals and possibly urine, pieces of
rebar and steel, and batteries, and fired ball bearings from sling
shots at police.
</P>
<P>
   He said officers gave warnings in English and Spanish and waited
20 minutes before moving in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone with common sense would have left the area on their own
volition when the violence reached such a high level,'' Kalish
said.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters said police stopped the concert, trapping thousands
of people in the area, and then hit the crowd with pepper spray and
rubber bullets. They said other protesters were trampled by the
horses.
</P>
<P>
   ACLU attorney Dan Tokaji said he has sent a letter to the City
Attorney's Office demanding an immediate meeting. The letter
details the ``outrageous abuse of power created by the LAPD.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't meet with us, we'll seek a third injunction
against the LAPD,'' Tokaji said. ``Last night is nothing less than
an orchestrated police riot.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayden said those injured in the melee -- along with their
attorneys -- were going to meet with LAPD Inspector General Jeff
Eglash.
</P>
<P>
   Tokaji said reports are streaming into his office detailing
gross violations of individual's civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Arianna Huffington, an organizer of the Shadow Convention at
Patriotic Hall, said people at the convention Tuesday were dismayed
at the exaggerated and disproportional use of force by the LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of concentrating on the few troublemakers, they
treated everyone, including children, reporters and even some
delegates caught in the melee, as a threat to public safety,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Protester Garrick Luiz, who showed reporters the red welts on
his arms, legs and back, said he was hit by rubber bullets after
the concert was shut down.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the response we get for speaking out when it's
supposedly a democracy,'' he said. ``I was repaid for with at least
one bullet for each of the issues I came here to speak to.''
</P>
<P>
   Medea Benjamin, co-founder of the Global Exchange and a Green
Party candidate for state Senate, said she was appalled by the
excessive use of force by police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were there dancing and all of a sudden mayhem broke
loose,'' she said. ``I can't believe the police called it
`appropriate measures and strategic use of force.' There is nothing
further from the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``To use pepper spray, rubber bullets, bean bag bullets on
people enjoying a concert is not appropriate, is not measured and
it certainly is not strategic,'' she said.

   LOS ANGELES _ Claiming hundreds of innocent demonstrators were
injured by police during a melee outside Staples Center, state Sen.
Tom Hayden and American Civil Liberties Union officials on Tuesday
called for an independent investigation of the LAPD's
``orchestrated riot'' against protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden, who said son Troy was among the injured, was joined in
his call for an investigation by D2KLA protest leaders and the
American Civil Liberties Union, which condemned the Los Angeles
Police Department's ``incredibly poor judgment.'' The ACLU is
planning to sue the city Wednesday over the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that the investigation will show there are
hundreds of people who are victims of last night's arsenal of
exotic weaponry that the police and security forces wanted to use
experimentally, psychologically and physically against
demonstrators,'' said Hayden, a Los Angeles Democrat who was one of
the ``Chicago Seven'' defendants after the violent clashes of the
1968 Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden said his son was hit during by a rubber bullet during
Monday night's melee. He also said he believes police used various
kinds of new gas weapons, adding that the type of pepper spray
police said they were using can damage the nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be evidence that hundreds of people who
were treated medically and hundreds of people who will give
affidavits as to what happened,'' Hayden said.

LIEBERMAN PLEDGES TO AVOID `NASTY' ATTACKS ON GOP'S BUSH

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Pledging to avoid ``nasty'' partisan attacks on
the Republican presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush, Sen.
Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut said in an interview Tuesday that
he would use his Democratic convention address Wednesday night to
start ``a conversation with the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who's been selected as Al Gore's runninng mate, said
that while he would not hesitate to ``respectfully'' point out
policy differences with the Republican Party, he would not play the
traditional role of the vice-presidential candidate as the attack
dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to Al about this,'' he said, ``and we're very
intent on talking about progress, not partisanship. This is not
going to be a campaign of personal attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Lieberman said, ``It doesn't have to be nasty; it doesn't
have to be partisan. I'm going to speak from the record of Al Gore,
the record of George Bush and the plans they've described.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he described Bush and Dick Cheney, the Republican
vice-presidential candidate, as ``decent and likable people'' who
represent ``a step backward for America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The choices here are very clear,'' Lieberman said. ``And these
choices I think will significantly affect the future of the people
of this country. Government doesn't do it all, but government sets
a tone, sets a direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, 58, conveyed a sense of easy anticipation as he
relaxed in a chair in a small room under the main convention stage.
About an hour later, he made an unscheduled foray onto the floor of
the convention, where he was mobbed by photographers. He waved and
blew kisses to the crowd, which responded with a delighted ovation.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Lieberman framed his role in the campaign
partly in the language of transition, of helping Democrats move
beyond the Clinton era.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of what he's accomplished,'' Lieberman said of
President Clinton. ``And I feel I'm really able to work with Al
Gore to continue the prosperity that he's built. But even though
the Republicans seem to want to run against Bill Clinton, he's not
on the ballot, and part of my role, and my opportunity here, is to
sort of continue to talk about the smooth transition to keep the
prosperity going.''
</P>
<P>
   But his first task in his speech, Lieberman said, would be to
introduce himself to the American public _ ``who I am, what my
values are.'' He said he also planned to reintroduce Gore to the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in him,'' Lieberman said of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think, certainly when I look at opinion polls, that a lot
of people don't know Al Gore,'' he said. ``And I think the more
they know him, the more they're going to like him. He's a person of
great strength, honor and tremendously creative intellect.''
</P>
<P>
   Through these themes, Leiberman said he hoped to foreshadow the
role he sees for himself in the campaign. By talking about his
values and his faith, he said he would try to help Gore reach swing
voters at the political center. By vouching for Gore's character,
he would try to neutralize the effects of the White House scandals.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman is learning how difficult it can be to stay
focused on those roles. In forging a reputation as a centrist
Democrat, he had taken positions and made statements that are
unpopular among more liberal Democrats. On Tuesday, he found
himself defending his views on affirmative action and school
vouchers to members of the Democratic National Committee's black
caucus.
</P>
<P>
   But otherwise, Lieberman reveled in what he calls ``my new
life,'' a life of arriving at airports past midnight and finding 25
reporters waiting, of being whisked about in motorcades as if
lifted on a magic carpet, of carrying the full measure of
expectation that comes from being the first Jew to be a
presidential running mate on a major ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is as if you've been touched, called,'' Lieberman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nine days ago he and his wife, Hadassah, awoke to reports that
he had been chosen as Gore's running mate. Even now, he said, the
notion comes as a sort of surreal surprise, one that had seemed
beyond reach. And yet on Wednesday night, Lieberman will stand
before the nation and deliver the most important speech of his
life, one, he said, that he hopes a lifetime in politics has
prepared him for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though the scope is obviously enormously larger, in many ways
my 30 years of public life have prepared me for this moment,'' he
said. ``I don't mean that anyone is ever fully prepared, but I feel
as if all the experiences, all that I've learned are coming
together, are being tested, and frankly I find it exhilarating. ''
</P>
<P>
   This morning, when Lieberman walked to the convention podium for
a brief rehearsal, he grinned broadly and spread his arms wide, as
if eager to embrace this strange new life.
</P>
<P>
   ``An only-in-America moment,'' he said to a group of
photographers.

MAN KILLS MOTHER OF HIS THREE CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LISA VAN PROYEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Enraged that his relationship was ending, a man
sprayed bullets at the mother of his three children as she ran
through her office and across the street Tuesday in Studio City,
fatally shooting her after she tripped on a curb and fell, police
and co-workers said.
</P>
<P>
   He then turned the gun on himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him shoot three times at the girl. Then he put the gun
to his head once,'' one witness said, declining to identify
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Cortez, 34, was killed near her job at MedStar Foot and
Ankle, police said. She had repeatedly told friends and co-workers
that she could handle her boyfriend's longtime abuse on her own,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this guy was capable of a lot more than we thought.
She felt like she could handle it -- and then this happens,'' said
Allen Selner, a podiatrist at MedStar on Laurel Canyon Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   The boyfriend, who was not identified, apparently followed
Cortez to work from their home in Los Angeles, where they lived
with their son, Brad, 8, and two daughters, Jennifer, 12, and
Kelly, 5.
</P>
<P>
   As Cortez stepped out of her car to report to work about 8 a.m.,
he fired several rounds at her in the parking lot behind MedStar,
said LAPD Detective Mike Coffey of the North Hollywood Division.
</P>
<P>
   She ran inside, but he chased after her, firing one round just
feet away from other workers, Coffey said.
</P>
<P>
   He momentarily pointed a handgun at a worker but Cortez quickly
diverted his attention, Selner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She saved one of the girl's lives,'' the podiatrist said. ``He
had a gun pointed in one of the other girl's face. She hollered for
her co-workers to get out of the way, and to protect the other
girls as she ran outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Cortez ran across Laurel Canyon Boulevard, with her boyfriend
following and shooting off more rounds, Coffey said. A co-worker
said Cortez tripped and fell on the curb, where her boyfriend shot
her three times before quickly killing himself in front of a row of
businesses on Laurel Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Cortez was transported to Providence Holy Cross Medical Center,
where she was pronounced dead, Coffey said.
</P>
<P>
   The man was pronounced dead at the scene, with the gun found
next to him.
</P>
<P>
   MedStar closed for the day, only taking emergency cases,
employees said.
</P>
<P>
   Cortez worked for seven years at the podiatry office, where she
managed the back office. At night, she worked a second job,
stocking shelves in a grocery store to build a better life for her
three children, Selner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the sweetest, loving person ... There isn't a harder
working person. She's the best. You just don't find people like
this,'' Selner said.
</P>
<P>
   Cortez and her boyfriend would argue in the company parking lot
and he would sit waiting for her for hours at a time in the lobby,
friends and co-workers said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, within recent weeks, she called their relationship off,
said Dennis Colonello, a chiropractor at MedStar.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was trying to find a way to get away from him,'' Colonello
said. ``She didn't know what to do. She was afraid to incite him
... I think what provoked him was her telling him that it was over
in the last two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, she went to the Police Department, but did not file a
restraining order out of fear, her co-workers said.
</P>
<P>
   After the attack Tuesday, teary-eyed co-workers watched
investigators at work, expressing guilt about how they could have
done more.
</P>
<P>
   But other workers said Cortez turned down offers of help.
</P>
<P>
   The employees offered to have somebody protect her, Selner said.
But she insisted that she could handle the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing we could do,'' Selner said. ``We felt
frustrated because we didn't know what to do with this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Selner arranged for counselors to talk with employees about the
shooting. The employees have set up a fund for Cortez's three
children.

TEACHER MARCH FOR PAY, GORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Thousands of teachers took fo the streets Tuesday,
marching peacefully downtown -- mostly for a pay raise, but also in
a show of support for Al Gore and in opposition to a school voucher
initiative on the Nov. 7 state ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers, estimated at more than 2,000, drew support from
striking commercial actors and joined hotel workers seeking union
representation at the New Otani Hotel along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a perfect time for us to be out here when the Democractic
convention is here and we're in the public eye,'' said Ronda Kalan,
who teaches special education students at Lokrantz Elementary
School in Reseda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the Cold War is over, this is our big opportunity to
focus on children,'' said Tom Squires, a fifth-grade teacher at
Harding Street Elementary School in Sylmar.
</P>
<P>
   Squires, the father of two recent college graduates, said they
make more money waiting tables than they would as starting teachers
-- ``and they don't have homework.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying they want a pay raise on par with the 10 percent hikes
being won by educators across the county -- and pointing to the Los
School District's costly Belmont scandal and pay raises for some
administrators -- the marchers cheered local labor and political
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it common sense and good, sound educational policy to
pay teachers what they're worth?'' asked Sandra Feldman, president
of the American Federation of Teachers. Higher pay also will solve
the current teacher shortage, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers, vowing to strike if district leaders do not meet their
requests, walked for several miles on downtown streets and chanted,
``We've got the power'' and ``No contract, no teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   The teachers, who have been without a contract since the end of
June, are asking for a 21 percent pay increase, which includes a 6
percent retroactive increase.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher Caryn Morisette said she hoped Democrats attending the
party's nominating convention at Staples Center heard the
educators' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping for their support more than anything else. Our
beef is with the (school) district.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officers with helmets and clubs were posted along the
route, and some teachers said they were surprised by the police
presence. One teacher said a police officer told him authorities
were concerned about protesters disrupting the teachers' march.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid at times,'' said Ana Valencica, a third-grade
teacher at City Terrace Elementary. ``We did have security, we did
have protection, (but) on the other hand it was a little
intimidating. ... I think it was uncalled for.''

YANKEES CRUSH RANGERS, 10-2 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ David Cone was sitting in the steamy
third-base dugout in the first inning on Tuesday night, surely
contemplating the importance of his start against the Texas
Rangers. Cone realized that he had to follow up his first victory
in 104 days with another positive effort or all of the doubts and
all of the questions about him would come creeping back.
</P>
<P>
   Then Cone saw the Yankees pummel Doug Davis and he saw several
reasons for instantly feeling comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   There was a leadoff single by Derek Jeter, a run-scoring single
by Paul O'Neill, a bloop single by Jose Canseco that knocked in a
run and a monstrous two-run homer by David Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Cone's anxieties gradually dissipated.
</P>
<P>
   Before Cone had dug in in front of the pitcher's mound, the
Yankees scorched Davis for four runs.
</P>
<P>
   By the third inning, they had seven runs and Cone's comfort
level had grown immeasurably.
</P>
<P>
   Cone wound up pitching five innings, the Yankees wound up
prevailing, 10-2, and Cone was elated to win a second straight
start for the first time since he topped the Baltimore Orioles on
June 26 and July 2, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Cone can salvage something from what was a dreadful season
until two weeks ago. Cone would also be thrilled to become a
footnote in a game like Tuesday night's. The Yankees won with a
relentless attack and they stymied the Rangers for the 10th
straight time, including the 1999 division series. Not only that,
but with Boston losing to Tampa Bay, the Yankees also widened their
division lead to five games.
</P>
<P>
   If Cone had not experienced a 15-start streak without victory
from April to August, he would have been a minor part of recapping
this game after tossing five sound innings in the 93-degree
weather.
</P>
<P>
   But Cone's performances have given the Yankees hope that his
tinkering in Tampa, Fla., has helped resurrect him. Cone has
allowed seven earned runs in his last 17 innings (3.71 earned run
average) and improved his record to 3-10.
</P>
<P>
   With Orlando Hernandez trying to recover from injuries and Denny
Neagle struggling, Cone might manage to slip back into the equation
for the postseason rotation. That option seemed inconceivable
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Cone pitched the way a pitcher should work with a large lead by
throwing strikes and not trying to be too perfect. The Rangers had
a runner on second in the first, but Cone struck out Rafael
Palmeiro with a 3-2 curveball.
</P>
<P>
   Cone gave up two runs and four hits in the fifth, but he got
Gabe Kapler to fly out to end the inning. Since Cone had thrown 92
pitches, seemed like he was tiring and already felt good about his
effort, Torre summoned Dwight Gooden for the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Cone gave up seven hits, struck out three and walked one.
</P>
<P>
   When O'Neill was asked about Davis before the game, he admitted,
``I don't know anything about him.'' Apparently, the Yankees knew
enough about the rookie left-hander. Davis barely got a chance to
take a breath in the first. Jeter lined a single to left, Luis Sojo
blooped a single to right center and O'Neill ended an 0-for-15
slump by belting a single to left for a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I'm going, I'm due for a 15 for 30 soon,'' said
O'Neill, who went 3 for 5.
</P>
<P>
   After Bernie Williams rapped into a double play, Davis induced
Canseco to hit a 200-foot pop-up that dropped in front of right
fielder Ricky Ledee to put the Yankees ahead, 2-0. It was a
devastating bloop because it enabled Justice to come to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Before Justice batted, a fan near the crowd microphone outside
the press box shouted, ``You stink, Justice.''
</P>
<P>
   A few seconds after the fan finished his rant, Justice hammered
Davis's 1-0 slider, dropped his bat and watched the ball soar about
10 rows deep into the right-field upper deck.
</P>
<P>
   The 443-foot homer was the longest ever hit to right field here,
and it gave Justice 10 homers in 38 games as a Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, the fan yelled, ``You still stink, Justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius, who turned 34 on Tuesday, stroked a two-run homer
in the third, Jorge Posada doubled in a run in the fourth, O'Neill
blasted a two-run homer in the fifth and the Yankees were cruising
with a 10-run cushion.
</P>
<P>
   So was Cone. His season had been on life support for at least a
month, but Cone has won twice in six days to revive himself and
make the rest of the season intriguing instead of painful.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Invoking the themes that her father offered here
40 years ago this summer, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg stepped out
of her guarded private life and onto the stage of the Democratic
convention on Tuesday night to lend the family name to Al Gore's
presidential campaign and to thank the nation for its support
through what was another difficult year for the Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank all Americans for making me and John, and all of our
family, a part of your families _ for reaching out and sustaining
us through the good times, and the difficult ones, and for helping
us dream my father's dream,'' Schlossberg said. ``As I look across
this hall, and across this country, I know that my father's spirit
lives on, and I thank all of you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it is our turn to prove that the New Frontier was not a
place in time, but a timeless call,'' she said, referring to the
signature phrase of her father's abbreviated years in office.
</P>
<P>
   It was a poignant moment for Schlossberg. Her simple agreement
to speak here on Tuesday night _ she has all but disappeared from
public view since her father's assassination in November of 1963
-was a reminder that she is now the only surviving member of the
Kennedy family that occupied the White House from 1961 through
1963. Schlossberg's brother, John Jr., who enjoyed public attention
almost as much as his sister shunned it, died in an airplane
accident last year.
</P>
<P>
   Schlossberg was one of four members of the extended Kennedy
family who spoke here on Tuesday, and her official task was to
introduce ``Uncle Teddy,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts.
She took the stage to the sound of the theme from ``Camelot,'' the
1960s musical that became identified with her father's
administration.
</P>
<P>
   But not surprisingly, her remarks were filled with mentions of
her father, who died when she was 5. They were a reminder of the
continuing sway that the Kennedy family in general, and John F.
Kennedy in particular, wields among Democrats, at a convention
where many of the delegates were not even born when Kennedy served
as president.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled her upbringing, saying, ``I was lucky enough to
grow up in a world where adults taught by example. They dreamed
impossible dreams, yet they fought hard each day to make those
dreams come true.''And she reminded the audience that her father,
40 years ago, wanted, ``not only to make better the world that
surrounds us but to dream of something more.
</P>
<P>
   Schlossberg delivered the speech in a city that is for the
Kennedys both a place of triumph, where Kennedy was nominated to
run for president, and of tragedy, because Robert F. Kennedy was
assassinated just blocks from where Schlossberg spoke on Tuesday
night, while campaigning for president in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, she alluded to the losses that her family has suffered
through violence, saying, ``If we believe that we have seen enough
gun violence in our land and in our lifetimes - that guns should no
longer take the lives of those we love - then it is up to us. If we
believe in these things, then it is up to us to elect Al Gore and
Joe Lieberman.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlossberg was poised, but seemed _ not surprisingly _ a bit
nervous as she looked over a conventional hall crammed to the
ceiling with delegates, onlookers, and reporters. She then
proceeded to quote her father, suggesting that what Kennedy said in
Los Angeles when he was nominated for president was as relevant
today as it was then: ``Our call is to the young at heart,
regardless of age,'' he said. ``The whole world looks to see what
we will do. We cannot fail their trust; we cannot fail to try.''

GANT DOES IT ALL IN ANGELS' WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The Angels got Ron Gant for what he could do with his
bat, not his glove. But Tuesday night they got both in an 8-4
victory over the Toronto Blue Jays in front of 26,706 at SkyDome.
</P>
<P>
   Gant, acquired from the Phillies in a trade for pitcher Kent
Bottenfield on July 30, homered and drove in three runs. But the
play that might have been the difference was his Jerry Rice
impersonation in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had taken a 3-0 lead on home runs by Garret Anderson
and Mo Vaughn, but were in danger of giving up that lead after the
Blue Jays loaded the bases on two singles and a walk with one out
against starter Matt Wise.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Batista, who began the night tied for second in the
American League with 34 homers, worked the count full before
hitting a liner deep to left field. Gant sprinted back and made a
wide receiver-like over-the-shoulder catch while crashing into the
chain-link fence, knocking him down like he was hit by Ronnie Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Martinez tagged and scored on the sacrifice fly, but the
catch saved at least one and possibly two more runs. It also put
the brakes on what could have been a big inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had a chance to play defense yet since I've been
here,'' said Gant, who has started two games in left field and five
as the designated hitter. ``I told myself I wasn't going to let
anything stop me from catching it. I want to prove I can play
defense too, that if they need somebody out there, they've got a
solid guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not afraid of running into the wall you can make
that catch. I thought I was going to go through it. Thank God it
gives.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got out of the inning with a 3-1 lead and increased
it to 6-1 with a three-run fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen Ronny play a long time,'' Angels manager Mike
Scioscia said. ``This guy is an aggressive outfielder. He's
certainly not afraid of diving for a ball or running into a wall.
That catch, you talk about a momentum switch. That was
tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels offense had a hand in it too, knocking starter David
Wells (17-5) out after only 4 innings. Darin Erstad and Anderson
each had three hits, and Troy Glaus and Vaughn had two apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Wise (1-1) got the win after going 6 innings and allowing three
runs and five hits. It was the first victory of his major-league
career, and he couldn't thank Gant enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was unbelievable,'' Wise said. ``When the ball left his
bat, at first I thought it was a grand slam.''
</P>
<P>
   Two innings earlier, Wise was involved in a staredown with Blue
Jays slugger Carlos Delgado. The Angels were using a dramatic
infield shift on Delgado with the third baseman Glaus closer to
second base, so Delgado squared to bunt. Wise's pitch was slightly
inside, but Delgado couldn't get out of the way and it hit him high
on the thigh.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado took a few steps toward the mound and had a few choice
words for Wise, who stared right back.
</P>
<P>
   When the Angels came to bat in the top of the third, the first
pitch from Wells hit Benji Gil on the right kneecap. Home plate
umpire Andrew Fletcher warned both teams any further incidents
would result in ejections, but Scioscia wasn't happy and went out
to argue with Fletcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The umpires) are saying (Wells) threw at Benji, but in no way
was Wise trying to hit Delgado,'' Scioscia said. ``It was obvious
to us and obvious to the umpires (Wells hit Gil intentionally). I
don't know what (the Blue Jays') reaction would stem from. If (the
umpires) thought (Wells) was throwing at a guy, they should have
thrown him out of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   After the incident, Scioscia made a trip to the mound to keep
Wise from losing his focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out there to calm him down and he calmed me down,''
Scioscia said. ``I said, `Let's get back on the beam,' and he said,
`The heck with that, let's go.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I'm not trying to hit him,'' Wise said. ``That would
be ridiculous that early in the game. I'm glad it didn't escalate
from there. I just wanted to throw a good ballgame and win the
ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Delgado said after the game he overreacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Delgado's) a lot bigger (6-foot-3, 225 pounds) than I thought
he was,'' Wise said. ``I'm not going to pick a fight with someone
that big. But I was a little fired up. When he came out I didn't
want to show I was intimidated.'' &QL;

LIEBERMAN CLARIFIES STAND ON RACE, ENGAGES HOLLYWOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HARRISON SHEPPARD 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Taking time off from preparing for his ``only in
America'' moment accepting the Democratic vice presidential
nomination Tuesday night, Sen. Joseph Lieberman spent much of
Tuesday healing rifts with African-American leaders and meeting
with politicians and Hollywood executives.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut senator who harshly criticized the movie and
music industry for its overemphasis on sex and violence, offering
``Silver Sewer'' awards to the worst, spent the evening at a
Democratic party held at a producer's home in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, he addressed 300 members of the
Congressional Black Caucus and won a reluctant pledge of support
from U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Los Angeles, by supporting
affirmative action -- but not quotas -- and leading the group in
singing ``Happy Birthday'' to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say a word to you particularly about the rapport
that I have felt over my life with the African-American community
in my commitment to civil rights,'' said Lieberman, an Orthodox
Jew.
</P>
<P>
   ``It honestly begins with my religion because I believe as a
matter of faith, not just that God created all of us, ... I believe
that every human being is created in God's image.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman will have to reach deep for his powers of persuasion
when he takes the podium Wednesday night at Staples Center to
deliver his acceptance speech. Political analysts said he has to
walk a fine line between boosting himself and potentially
overshadowing Gore, as many analysts said Bill and Hillary Clinton
did in their speeches Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``His speech is probably huge in the sense of figuring out who
this guy is on a national basis -- beyond the snippets we've read
in the last couple of days as people have scurried to try to
understand this senator from a small state on the East Coast,''
said Richard Lichtenstein, a Los Angeles Democratic political
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think most people knew who Lieberman was, nor did
anyone expect he would ever be selected.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, his wife, Hadassah, and daughter Hana, 12, swept into
Los Angeles at 1 a.m. Tuesday, touching down at Burbank Airport,
where he was met by members of the state Legislature and the media.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first to greet him was Assembly Speaker Bob
Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, widely known as the ``Hugger,'' who embraced
him with a big hug.
</P>
<P>
   Hadassah Lieberman got a taste of just how much press coverage
of her husband will escalate in the next few months as he seeks
national office.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she was speaking to us, she said, `You know, I'm amazed
all these people are out here at 1 in the morning. When they told
us there were throngs of press out there we were kind of stunned,'
'' recalled state Sen. Richard Alarcon, D-Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she had to quickly throw on some makeup.''
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, Lieberman met with the Congressional Black
Caucus for the start of a series of constituent group meetings that
will continue Wednesday with meetings with Latino, gay and lesbian,
and Asian and Pacific caucuses, then greet Vice President Al Gore
upon his arrival at Burbank Airport, where the two will hold a
rally and press conference.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting with African-American leaders posed the biggest
challenge, since Waters and others had expressed concern over
Lieberman's stances on affirmative action and school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman reminded the group that in 1963, he marched on
Washington with Martin Luther King Jr. and went into Mississippi to
register African-American voters.
</P>
<P>
   He said he opposes what he regards as racial quotas and sought
to explain his support for Proposition 209, the 1996 California
proposition that banned state-funded affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   He said a reporter had read the proposition to him and that he
responded favorably, saying it sounded like a basic human rights
policy. He said he never campaigned for it even though he was asked
to do so and made crucial votes in the Senate in favor of
affirmative action in 1995 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has said enough, he has done enough and he has demonstrated
his willingness to deal with issues of concern to the black
community,'' Waters said. ``I feel comfortable in campaigning for
him. I was not going to do it and lose credibility if these issues
had not been clarified.''
</P>
<P>
   Before holing up in his hotel to rehearse his speech in the
afternoon, Lieberman went to Staples Center and mounted the podium.
He grinned broadly, spread his arms and told a group of
photographers, ``An only-in-America moment.''
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, he mingled with Hollywood insiders and
politicians in a reception hosted by The New Democrat Network at
the Beverly Hills home of producer David Salzman and his wife,
Sonia. NDN is described by reception organizers as a ``4-year-old
political venture capital fund for the Democratic Party (which)
makes strategic investments in a new generation of elected
officials at all levels of government.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood community has had a somewhat schizophrenic
reaction to Lieberman. While the entertainment industry tends to
favor Democrats, many bristle at the senator's criticisms of the
industry's moral decay.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the industry, however, do support his views.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainer Steve Allen, for example, who has spoken out
frequently against violence in films and television and is now
working on a book titled ``Trash TV, Raunch Radio,'' agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm overjoyed about Mr. Gore's choice,'' Allen said. ``Because
Joe Lieberman, whom I've met on two earlier occasions in
Washington, strikes me as that rarity in politics, which both
parties have traditionally honored in the abstract: the true man of
principal. And a man to whom ethical and moral questions are of the
most fundamental importance. That is simply not the case with every
politician.''

DEMOCRATS SUMMON OLD IDEALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN AND MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With a rousing call from the Kennedys and tributes
from the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Bill Bradley, the Democratic Party
paid homage Tuesday night to its liberal base even as it adopted a
centrist platform designed for Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   One after another, the speakers evoked tragic memories while
urging the election of Gore for a brighter future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was here, in this City of Angels, on a warm summer night 40
years ago, that America first looked across the New Frontier,''
said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, invoking the words of his late
brother, President John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party, Bradley said, must continue to fight ``for
the ideals of Jack and Bobby and Martin, the ideals they died
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the speakers invoked the memory of President Kennedy,
Robert F. Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr., a potentially
divisive fight over the party's direction was being quelled. Vice
presidential candidate Joseph I. Lieberman, speaking before the
Congressional Black Caucus, said, ``I do support affirmative
action.''
</P>
<P>
   Caucus members who had expressed doubts about Lieberman's
commitment, based on his past expressions of skepticism about
``group preferences'' of any kind, said they were satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   That allowed the Democrats to stick to their evening script,
which called for a parade of liberal leaders to put their
imprimatur on Gore. Hours earlier, the convention adopted a
platform, with hardly any public comment, even though some key
provisions, including support for free-trade policies and the death
penalty, did not please the liberal wing.
</P>
<P>
   While many speakers remembered President Kennedy, none did so
with more emotional power than Caroline Kennedy, the president's
daughter, who strode to the podium accompanied by music from
``Camelot.'' Recalling that her father was nominated for president
in Los Angeles in 1960, she said, ``As I look out across this hall,
and across this country, I know that my father's spirit lives on.''
</P>
<P>
   For this most private of Kennedys, the experience of delivering
a speech to a vast arena was clearly new. She stopped and started
as the applause lifted and subsided, sometimes drowning out her
words. She smiled broadly, but almost shyly, at the reception she
received.
</P>
<P>
   But the crowd was always with her, and as she spoke, a delegate
could be seen waving a sign that said ``I'm here because of your
father.''
</P>
<P>
   After Kennedy introduced her uncle, Senator Kennedy kept the
memory train rolling with an anecdote that tugged at the emotions
of many in the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember election night in November of 1960,'' he said.
``The results were so close that my brother went to bed still not
certain that he had won. It was nearly dawn when victory finally
became clear. And here is how Jack learned about it: from
3-year-old Caroline, who woke him up by jumping on his bed and
shouting, `Good morning, Mr. President.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time he ever heard those words from anyone,''
the senator said.
</P>
<P>
   The 68-year-old Kennedy spoke forcefully but sometimes
awkwardly, losing his way in his text several times as he read from
a teleprompter. His booming baritone filled the hall but also
cracked several times.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials denied that the roster of Kennedys _ which
also included Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Maryland Lieutenant
Governor Kathleen Kennedy Townsend _ was a calculated and emotional
plea to the party's left wing.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has strived since the end of the primaries to consolidate
the liberal base. But many of those Democrats are not inclined to
vote for a Republican. Instead, some liberals and others have
flirted with Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, or are
considering staying home on Election Day, polls show.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy Townsend, in an interview, said the Kennedys had
discussed the emotional impact of the evening and concluded that
they needed to come out in force for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is emotional because there is a lot that happened in Los
Angeles,'' the daughter of Robert Kennedy said. Referring to the
assasination of her father, she said, ``In 1968, a lot of hope came
to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said the family is convinced that the Gore-Lieberman
ticket is the best hope for continuing the Kennedy legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, meanwhile, spent much of Tuesday tamping down fears
by African-Americans that his support for affirmative action _ a
liberal touchstone _ was not as firm as they would like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have supported affirmative action. I do support affirmative
action. I will support affirmative action,'' he told the
Congressional Black Caucus, to loud applause.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said he had raised questions about the programs in the
mid-'90s, just as many officials had. But he agreed with the
findings of a White House review of the programs that advocated
mending affirmative action rather than ending it.
</P>
<P>
   California Representative Maxine Waters, who Monday had said she
could not fully support the ticket without an accounting by
Lieberman on his stance, said she was satisfied now and would
wholeheartedly endorse the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman also got a significant boost from Jackson, as the
civil rights leader used his famed rhetorical skills to embrace the
Orthodox Jewish senator from Connecticut as a fellow marcher in the
cause for civil and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week, when Al Gore chose Joe Lieberman as his running
mate, he stood up for justice,'' Jackson said. ``He appealed to the
best in America. In selecting Joe Lieberman, Al Gore has brought
the sons and daughters of slaves and slave master together with the
sons and daughters of Holocaust survivors, women fighting for
self-determination, workers fighting for wage security and
dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, in one of the most direct assaults on George W. Bush,
then deviated from his prepared text and brought the crowd to its
feet as he attacked the Republican presidential nominee and his
father, former President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, America, stay out of the Bushes!'' Jackson shouted.
</P>
<P>
   With so many star speakers, the evening's keynoter,
Representative Harold Ford Jr. of Tennessee, was largely
overshadowed. ``If you want a future that is for everyone, then
join with us to make Al Gore and Joe Lieberman the next president
and vice president of the United States,'' he said in a speech that
began with only a few minutes of prime time remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, the former New Jersey senator whose presidential
campaign rested on a call for universal health insurance, wasted no
time in embracing Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely essential that we get behind Al Gore,''
Bradley said. ``When you run against someone, you get to know him
very well. I learned that Al Gore is a man of wide-ranging
intellect, with a deep desire to serve, profound preparation for
the job, a strong sense of loyalty, and a life view infused with
tolerance and rooted in religious faith.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was a unifying theme beyond the call to liberals, it
was the need for universal health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight, there are 44 million Americans who don't have health
insurance, which means 44 million Americans who can't take their
sick baby to a doctor, who don't have anyone to attend to their
dying parents, who can't get the medical help they need to stay on
the job,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   While delegates enjoyed the evocative walk down memory lane,
some thought it was a peculiar use of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I don't see the merit to the strategy,'' said John
Rauh, a New Hampshire Democrat who supported Bradley. ``I can't
imagine liberals voting for George Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Tad Devine, a senior adviser to the Gore campaign, said the
Democrats have a diverse party with people of many different
philosophies, ideologies, and approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't feel we need to lock them in the closet this week,''
Devine said, taking a jab at the Republican convention where some
of the GOP's most prominent conservatives were denied speaking
roles.
</P>
<P>
   But some delegates believe Senator Kennedy, known for his fights
to raise the minimum wage, provide health insurance, and improve
education, does represent the party's true home. ``Whether you want
to call it a liberal wing or a progressive wing, we need to
energize our base,'' said Representative James P. McGovern, the
Worcester Democrat.

LIEBERMAN CLARIFIES STAND ON RACE, ENGAGES HOLLYWOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HARRISON SHEPPARD 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Taking time off from preparing for his ``only in
America'' moment accepting the Democratic vice presidential
nomination Tuesday night, Sen. Joseph Lieberman spent much of
Tuesday healing rifts with African-American leaders and meeting
with politicians and Hollywood executives.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut senator who harshly criticized the movie and
music industry for its overemphasis on sex and violence, offering
``Silver Sewer'' awards to the worst, spent the evening at a
Democratic party held at a producer's home in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, he addressed 300 members of the
Congressional Black Caucus and won a reluctant pledge of support
from U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Los Angeles, by supporting
affirmative action -- but not quotas -- and leading the group in
singing ``Happy Birthday'' to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say a word to you particularly about the rapport
that I have felt over my life with the African-American community
in my commitment to civil rights,'' said Lieberman, an Orthodox
Jew.
</P>
<P>
   ``It honestly begins with my religion because I believe as a
matter of faith, not just that God created all of us, ... I believe
that every human being is created in God's image.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman will have to reach deep for his powers of persuasion
when he takes the podium Wednesday night at Staples Center to
deliver his acceptance speech. Political analysts said he has to
walk a fine line between boosting himself and potentially
overshadowing Gore, as many analysts said Bill and Hillary Clinton
did in their speeches Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``His speech is probably huge in the sense of figuring out who
this guy is on a national basis -- beyond the snippets we've read
in the last couple of days as people have scurried to try to
understand this senator from a small state on the East Coast,''
said Richard Lichtenstein, a Los Angeles Democratic political
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think most people knew who Lieberman was, nor did
anyone expect he would ever be selected.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, his wife, Hadassah, and daughter Hana, 12, swept into
Los Angeles at 1 a.m. Tuesday, touching down at Burbank Airport,
where he was met by members of the state Legislature and the media.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first to greet him was Assembly Speaker Bob
Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, widely known as the ``Hugger,'' who embraced
him with a big hug.
</P>
<P>
   Hadassah Lieberman got a taste of just how much press coverage
of her husband will escalate in the next few months as he seeks
national office.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she was speaking to us, she said, `You know, I'm amazed
all these people are out here at 1 in the morning. When they told
us there were throngs of press out there we were kind of stunned,'
'' recalled state Sen. Richard Alarcon, D-Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she had to quickly throw on some makeup.''
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, Lieberman met with the Congressional Black
Caucus for the start of a series of constituent group meetings that
will continue Wednesday with meetings with Latino, gay and lesbian,
and Asian and Pacific caucuses, then greet Vice President Al Gore
upon his arrival at Burbank Airport, where the two will hold a
rally and press conference.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting with African-American leaders posed the biggest
challenge, since Waters and others had expressed concern over
Lieberman's stances on affirmative action and school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman reminded the group that in 1963, he marched on
Washington with Martin Luther King Jr. and went into Mississippi to
register African-American voters.
</P>
<P>
   He said he opposes what he regards as racial quotas and sought
to explain his support for Proposition 209, the 1996 California
proposition that banned state-funded affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   He said a reporter had read the proposition to him and that he
responded favorably, saying it sounded like a basic human rights
policy. He said he never campaigned for it even though he was asked
to do so and made crucial votes in the Senate in favor of
affirmative action in 1995 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has said enough, he has done enough and he has demonstrated
his willingness to deal with issues of concern to the black
community,'' Waters said. ``I feel comfortable in campaigning for
him. I was not going to do it and lose credibility if these issues
had not been clarified.''
</P>
<P>
   Before holing up in his hotel to rehearse his speech in the
afternoon, Lieberman went to Staples Center and mounted the podium.
He grinned broadly, spread his arms and told a group of
photographers, ``An only-in-America moment.''
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, he mingled with Hollywood insiders and
politicians in a reception hosted by The New Democrat Network at
the Beverly Hills home of producer David Salzman and his wife,
Sonia. NDN is described by reception organizers as a ``4-year-old
political venture capital fund for the Democratic Party (which)
makes strategic investments in a new generation of elected
officials at all levels of government.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood community has had a somewhat schizophrenic
reaction to Lieberman. While the entertainment industry tends to
favor Democrats, many bristle at the senator's criticisms of the
industry's moral decay.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the industry, however, do support his views.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainer Steve Allen, for example, who has spoken out
frequently against violence in films and television and is now
working on a book titled ``Trash TV, Raunch Radio,'' agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm overjoyed about Mr. Gore's choice,'' Allen said. ``Because
Joe Lieberman, whom I've met on two earlier occasions in
Washington, strikes me as that rarity in politics, which both
parties have traditionally honored in the abstract: the true man of
principal. And a man to whom ethical and moral questions are of the
most fundamental importance. That is simply not the case with every
politician.''

 CLINTON'S CLIMACTIC SPEECH PUTS PRESSURE ON gORE'S UPCOMING EVENT  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE and SCOTT CANON  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Look forward, not back. Be enthusiastic. Be
candid. Distinguish yourself. Above all, be yourself.
</P>
<P>
   One day after President Clinton's much-heralded farewell address
to the Democratic National Convention, the advice was flowing for
his would-be successor, Al Gore, who gives his own prime-time
speech Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The topic on the minds of many delegates and analysts around the
country: How can Gore top the rousing speech Clinton delivered to a
packed house on Monday night that had one Missourian calling the
president the ``Great Communicator?''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is not a Bill Clintonlike speaker,'' said Edward
Rendell, general chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
``Neither is George Bush. Neither is Bill Bradley. There isn't any.
You maybe have to go back to Jack Kennedy to find someone who can
reach people the way Bill Clinton does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore just has to show the American people how smart he is,
how much he cares and what a decent person he is.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is easier said than done. Monday night Clinton
probably increased the pressure on Gore for the nominee's own
speech _ traditionally the final and most closely watched event of
any convention.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem for Gore is that Democrats already have
experienced something of a climactic moment with Clinton's speech.
Trying to generate the same kind of over-the-top enthusiasm
Thursday could be tough, especially for a speaker who doesn't
normally inspire that type of passion, said Charles Jones, a
longtime political scientist at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night it was Clinton, Clinton, Clinton, Clinton,'' Jones
said. ``I kept wondering how I would feel if I was Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's speech also provides Gore an opportunity,
Democrats said. By focusing on the last eight years _ and by
dealing with the Monica Lewinsky scandal in a talk last week _
Clinton has freed Gore to focus on the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to say what he'll do next,'' said Joe Carmichael,
chairman of the Missouri Democratic Party. `` &UR; `You ain't seen
nothing yet' needs to be one of the themes.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the trick for Gore will be to forget about Clinton,
forget about the expectations and worry only about himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is alike,'' said House Minority Leader Richard
Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat. ``Al Gore does not have to get over
any bar. Al Gore has to talk about what's in his heart and mind and
what he wants to do. I think he'll do that well.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to do that would be to focus on an issue or two that
Gore can call his own, delegates said. For example, many voters
already associate Gore with the environment, so that could be a
topic for Gore. He also could focus on campaign reform, an issue
Gore already has elevated to the top of his agenda and one that
never gained much of a toehold during Clinton's years in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to mention issues that distinguish himself,'' said
Thad Beyle, a political scientist at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Many hoped Gore would be Gore, speaking to the convention and
the country without caution and with the enthusiasm that lets his
personality break through any political veneer.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Nelson Thompson, a leader of Kansas City's Freedom
Inc., recalled listening to Gore talk to black delegates four years
ago at the Democratic convention in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president charmed his audience with a cadence
resembling the classic oratory of a black preacher, he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got down, and he did it with power and meaning that
connects with people,'' Thompson said. ``It was real, and he was
himself. I just want to see him be himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Womack, who ran for the Missouri House in 1998, had the
same wish.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's himself, the experience shows through, and that's
what people will appreciate,'' said Womack of Kansas City, North.
</P>
<P>
   Gore needs to talk about the ways in which he will continue the
nation's economic prosperity, Womack said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to say he will continue what the team is doing,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   For state Sen. Ed Quick of Liberty, Mo., the key will be candor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to open up and let people know who Al Gore is. There
needs to be confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Rendell said voters needed to be realistic. He was confident
Gore would hit a round-tripper Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``And an Al Gore home run is different than a Bill Clinton home
run,'' Rendell said. ``But a home run is still a home run if it
goes 330 feet as opposed to 460 feet. It still counts as one run.''

SWIMMERS, NOT SUITS, WILL MAKE SPLASH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Don Talbot already has an idea of what's in store
for him after the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll either hang me, or ... '' Talbot said, his voice
trailing off in a sigh of grim possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 67, despite a long and golden career, Talbot has
been handed a job at which he can't win: head coach of Australia's
Olympic swim team.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine working for Bobby Knight, George Steinbrenner and Don
Corleone, all wrapped in one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you do will not be good enough,'' Talbot confessed.
</P>
<P>
   In Australia, there is no NFL season or World Series to distract
the couch-ensconced masses. Rugby and tennis still draw headlines,
but swimming is king.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian Olympic Trials in May were shown on live,
prime-time television. Cable TV carried every morning preliminary
heat. The radio coverage of the nightly finals was broadcast
coast-to-coast.
</P>
<P>
   To Talbot, therefore, the assignment in Sydney is simple _ win
more medals, preferably gold, than any other country. And
especially win more than those bloody Yanks.
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, Talbot and his assorted mates have been curious
observers of these eight days of U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials. And
they have been impressed, Talbot said Tuesday night, but not
surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a little soft where I thought they might be soft, and
they're strong where I thought they'd be strong,'' Talbot assessed.
``I've had no surprises here.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago in this same Indiana University Natatorium pool,
the U.S. team was chosen, somehow, without breaking a single
American record. Amid modest forecasts, that same team went to
Atlanta and won 26 medals, including 13 gold.
</P>
<P>
   At these trials, meanwhile, with only Wednesday's two finals
remaining, nine American records have fallen, as well as 21 Olympic
trials records.
</P>
<P>
   Is it the new bodysuits?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're a red herring,'' Talbot said.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial reversal by USA Swimming to allow the new
form-fitting suits at the trials has produced, as predicted, a
parade of bodysuits in the IU pool. But as the meet has progressed,
and the faster swimmers _ surprise _ seem to still be beating the
slower ones, more and more swimmers have shown up at the starting
blocks without the new suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting more info on the suits every day,'' said
longtime Australian coach Forbes Carlile. ``And from what we've
seen, the suits are not helping.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing is a great marketing bonanza going on. The
companies are selling a lot of swimsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   The American coaches gathered here seem to be saying the same
thing. Swimmers Jenny Thompson, Dara Torres, Tom Malchow and Gary
Hall Jr. were the class of the field coming into the trials, and
nothing about their races here have suggested otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you could put a bloody G-string on them and they'd go
just as fast,'' Talbot noted.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian journalists covering the U.S. trials say that a
similar percentage of Olympic hopefuls wore the bodysuits at the
Aussie trials. But in the end, Ian Thorpe, Grant Hackett, Michael
Klim and Susie O'Neill still all swam like future gold medal
winners.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot has called his team ``Australia's greatest ever,'' better
even than the 1956 Olympic team that out-medaled the United States
for the only time. Carlile, whose coaching career spans 55 years,
dubbed it the ``third golden era of Australian swimming.''
</P>
<P>
   The Australians also figure to have a partisan nightly crowd of
17,000 to cheer them on in Sydney. Talbot believes that will be
worth much more than any bodysuits.
</P>
<P>
   For seven days, he has seen the Yanks break records and stitch
together an intriguing blend of veterans and teen-agers. Lenny
Krayzelburg still appears to be the class of the Olympic field in
the backstroke. Malchow, in the 200 fly, has the look of a gold
medal winner. And Hall, as he proved again Tuesday night in the
men's 50-meter freestyle, is going to give Klim and Russian
Alexander Popov a challenge in the sprints.
</P>
<P>
   ``The women, well, that's a different story,'' Carlile said.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's O'Neill should win both the 200 free and 200
butterfly. But the home team lacks the female depth that the
Americans will bring, especially now that Thompson and Torres _
ages 27 and 33, respectively _ have emerged as possible
show-stealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a feel in the air back home,'' Talbot said Tuesday
night. ``I think it's going to be a very fast racing meet.''
</P>
<P>
   And if it is, Talbot repeated, it won't be the suits. nn

KC'S WATER CRISIS PASSES, BUT RAISES OTHER CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kansas Citians once again can trust the
quality of the water coming out of their taps.
</P>
<P>
   But the city's emergency management director said that Monday's
water-main break has taught him to question the reliability of City
Hall's phone system in a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   City water officials on Tuesday also expressed concerns that
until they knew why the pipe failed, they could not assess the
potential for further ruptures.
</P>
<P>
   The break, believed to be the worst in the city's history,
closed businesses and affected 150,000 people. It prompted
officials to announce a boil order for drinking water, but the
order was lifted Tuesday morning after tests showed the water was
safe.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, authorities reviewed the response to the emergency
and said the volume of calls coming into City Hall overwhelmed the
telephone system the day of the break.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the governor's office was trying to reach the
city's emergency management director to coordinate precautions for
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't call out, and they couldn't call in,'' said the
director, Mike Karl. ``You just kept hitting redial, redial, redial
and eventually you got out....That should not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials eventually paged a firefighter who walked down
to the basement emergency headquarters at City Hall to relay the
message.
</P>
<P>
   Karl said his report to City Manager Bob Collins would highlight
the communication problem. He said he had no specific remedies in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opens in my mind the possibility we could have a true,
citywide emergency and may not be able to coordinate as effectively
as we would like,'' Karl said.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he did not see anything fundamentally wrong with
the city's new telephone system. The city would look into the
situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the phone system in any emergency is something that we
are going to have to anticipate is going to be difficult to rely
on,'' Collins said. He added that most city officials relied on
cell phones Monday to communicate.
</P>
<P>
   Karl said people should be able to telephone someone at City
Hall in emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the water crisis was more inconvenient than
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Water Services Department and the Missouri
Department of Natural Resources lifted a precautionary order to
boil tap water before drinking at 8:30 a.m. Tuesday, nearly a full
day after the pipeline break in the West Bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   Government offices and most businesses downtown were open and
back to normal on Tuesday. Some were evacuated on Monday over fears
that fire-protection systems, such as sprinklers, would not work.
</P>
<P>
   Tests on water samples collected all over the affected area
showed beneficial traces of chlorine and bacteria counts within
normal limits.
</P>
<P>
   That means anyone who drank tap water Monday need not fear
health consequences, said water department spokeswoman Susan Hall.
There were no reported ill effects.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Health Department advised that water outlets be
flushed by opening the cold-water taps and letting the water run
until it became cold.
</P>
<P>
   Ice cubes in automatic icemakers should be thrown out and the
system cleaned and sanitized. The first batch of ice produced after
cleaning also should be thrown away.
</P>
<P>
   The precautions are necessary for an area from the Missouri
River south to 63rd Street and from the state line east to Eastern
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bottoms, water crews on Tuesday discovered three
breaks in separate 16-foot sections of the 48-inch water main near
25th and Allen streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``One section completely burst and two sections have serious
corrosion and were damaged as a result of the break,'' said Ron
Goold, water department assistant director for distribution and
collection.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-year-old concrete pipes were expected to last longer.
Replacement pipes were being trucked in Tuesday from Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   A pipe expert from Florida was brought in to investigate the
cause of the breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Answering that question will tell us the potential for
something similar to happen (elsewhere),'' said Goold.
</P>
<P>
   Beemer Construction Co. is ready to do the repair work in the
West Bottoms. Goold said the whole operation probably would take
another day or two and could cost $20,000 to $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Water customers should not be affected by the construction work,
because water is being pumped around the isolated break area.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for water contamination came not from the site of
the pipe break itself, but from the possibility of backflow at any
water outlet where the pressure dropped to zero, said Goold.
</P>
<P>
   A dishwasher in a restaurant, a hose in a back yard or any
pipeline connected to a potable water tap could have sucked up
contaminants in the absence of forward water pressure, Goold said.
</P>
<P>
   As a precaution, the city collected twice as many water samples
as usual on Monday and tested them overnight at its laboratory,
which is a backup lab for the state Department of Natural
Resources. The results were announced as soon as possible, said
Connie Hull, lab director.
</P>
<P>
   But by 8:30 a.m. thousands of people had already faced the task
of brushing teeth and preparing breakfast without tap water. And
some day-care centers had already decided to remain closed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot wash the children up after bathrooming and changing
diapers, and it's just not safe,'' said a recording at the Willow
Woods center on Westport Road.
</P>
<P>
   Other day-care centers in the affected area, however, did not
lose water and stayed open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We brought in bottled water to be on the safe side,'' said
Vicki Krapf, director of Global Montessori Academy on West 47th
Street.
</P>
<P>
   At the five hospitals that lost water, staff members Tuesday
turned on faucets to make sure pipes were flushed out before
patients and employees were allowed to use tap water.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, patients and employees continued to use bottled
water and to wash hands with waterless cleansers. The hospitals
also brought in coolers of ice while their ice machines were being
sanitized.
</P>
<P>
   Unsure when water would be restored, some of the affected
hospitals canceled surgeries and clinics on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The hospitals, Truman Medical Center, Trinity Lutheran Hospital,
St. Luke's Hospital, Children's Mercy Hospital and Veterans
Hospital, expected to be back in full operation today.

MAINE TEEN OUT OF A SMALL POOL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ To put Ian Crocker's Olympic Swimming Trials in
perspective, you don't have to go far.
</P>
<P>
   When you live in Maine and dream of swimming in the Olympics,
you can't.
</P>
<P>
   There are no Olympic-size, 50-meter pools in Maine. To get
training time in a big pool, Crocker and his Portland Porpoise Swim
Club have to slip across the border each summer into New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't swim in a 50-meter pool, when you finally get in,
you notice there's no wall and your arms get a little tired,''
Crocker said, after swimming to victory in the men's 100-meter
butterfly last night.
</P>
<P>
   The problem doesn't seem to be hurting him. Crocker swam the 100
butterfly in 52.78 seconds and broke the trials record he had set
Monday in the preliminaries. He missed Texas ex Neil Walker's
American record by .02 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Crocker will follow in Walker's wake and attend Texas _ once he
returns from the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   His calm reaction last night belied the fact that Crocker is
only 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I guess, I'm just kind of blown away,'' he said.
``I'm feeling so many different emotions. It's been such a long
road.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Crocker on the Olympic team is another UT swimmer,
junior-to-be Tommy Hannan, a native of Baltimore. Hannan took the
field out at a world record pace and ended up second in 52.81. Both
Hannan and Crocker swam under Matt Biondi's 1988 meet record of
53.09 that Crocker broke in the prelims.
</P>
<P>
   With Bryan Jones finishing fourth and Matt Ulrickson fifth, it
meant that four of the first five finishers in the race had
University of Texas ties. RECORDS SUBMERGED
</P>
<P>
   The record tally after last night's four finals shows nine
American records in these Olympic trials and 21 meet records.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Hall Jr. was the latest, shaving .05 off the American
record previously held by Tom Jager in the 50-meter freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 1,300 swimmers competing in the trials, 19
national age-group records have also fallen. One of them is the
national 11-12 age-group record in the women's 100-meter butterfly,
where 12-year-old Dana Vollmer of Granbury, Texas, swam 1:02.49 in
her preliminary heat. BREAK FOR VAN DYKEN
</P>
<P>
   With Jenny Thompson dropping out of the women's 50-meter
freestyle to concentrate on her two other individual events, the
door has been left open for veteran Amy Van Dyken.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't look as if she can catch Dara Torres, who led all
qualifiers to tonight's finals in 24.93 seconds. But Van Dyken's
25.11 was the second fastest of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Van Dyken, 27, was feeling her age after she was told by someone
``that I've been swimming longer than she's been alive _ that's
kind of sad.''

TEACHER MARCH FOR PAY, GORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DONNA HUFFAKER and LISA MASCARO 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Thousands of teachers and their supporters took to
the streets Tuesday, marching peacefully downtown -- mostly for a
pay raise, but also in a show of support for Al Gore and in
opposition to a school voucher initiative on the Nov. 7 state
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The marchers, estimated at more than 2,000, drew support from
striking commercial actors and joined hotel workers seeking union
representation at the New Otani Hotel along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a perfect time for us to be out here when the Democractic
convention is here and we're in the public eye,'' said Ronda Kalan,
who teaches special education students at Lokrantz Elementary
School in Reseda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the Cold War is over, this is our big opportunity to
focus on children,'' said Tom Squires, a fifth-grade teacher at
Harding Street Elementary School in Sylmar.
</P>
<P>
   Squires, the father of two recent college graduates, said they
make more money waiting tables than they would as starting teachers
-- ``and they don't have homework.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying they want a pay raise on par with the 10 percent hikes
being won by educators across the county -- and pointing to the Los
School District's costly Belmont scandal and pay raises for some
administrators -- the marchers cheered local labor and political
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it common sense and good, sound educational policy to
pay teachers what they're worth?'' asked Sandra Feldman, president
of the American Federation of Teachers. Higher pay also will solve
the current teacher shortage, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers, vowing to strike if district leaders do not meet their
requests, walked for several miles on downtown streets and chanted,
``We've got the power'' and ``No contract, no teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   The teachers, who have been without a contract since the end of
June, are asking for a 21 percent pay increase, which includes a 6
percent retroactive increase.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher Caryn Morisette said she hoped Democrats attending the
party's nominating convention at Staples Center heard the
educators' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping for their support more than anything else. Our
beef is with the (school) district.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officers with helmets and clubs were posted along the
route, and some teachers said they were surprised by the police
presence. One teacher said a police officer told him authorities
were concerned about protesters disrupting the teachers' march.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid at times,'' said Ana Valencica, a third-grade
teacher at City Terrace Elementary. ``We did have security, we did
have protection, (but) on the other hand it was a little
intimidating. ... I think it was uncalled for.''

CHILD OF SLAIN WOMAN MAY MEET WITH BIOLOGICAL FATHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A tentative agreement could reunite a girl,
whose mother allegedly was murdered by John E. Robinson Sr., with
her biological father.
</P>
<P>
   In the deal brokered Monday by Johnson County, Kan., District
Attorney Paul Morrison, the couple rearing the child born as
Tiffany Lynn Stasi _ she is nearly 16 now _ consented to a plan
that could have her talking to Carl Stasi early this fall.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the bargain, Carl Stasi will undergo a blood test to
confirm he is the biological father. He married the girl's mother,
Lisa Stasi, about a month before the girl was born and was listed
on her birth certificate as the father.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Stasi initiated the request to meet communicate with girl.
</P>
<P>
   State laws typically assign the rights and responsibilities of
fatherhood to the husband of a child's mother, often even when DNA
points to someone else. Stasi's attorney said his client agreed to
the test to speed his reunion, rather than go to court and risk a
judge handing off the girl to a third party.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just wants to see his daughter,'' said Kirksville, Mo.,
attorney Seth Shumaker. ``If that means giving in a little, we're
going to do it....To fight them would just cost us time.''
</P>
<P>
   Results from the DNA test are expected to take about three
weeks. In the meantime, the custodial parents have pledged to send
Stasi records about the girl's health. Both sides will consult
psychologists to determine how to get the teen-ager together with
Stasi without causing her emotional trauma.
</P>
<P>
   The two would then correspond by letter and e-mail, Shumaker
said. If that went well, they would speak on the telephone and
eventually meet face to face.
</P>
<P>
   Stasi has not seen his daughter since she was an infant. He
married the former Lisa Elledge, then a 19-year-old high school
drop-out, in August 1984. She gave birth to Tiffany Stasi in
September. By late December the couple's marriage was falling apart
and Lisa checked in at a Kansas City battered women's shelter,
where she stayed for a short time.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1985, by the accounts of several people at the time,
she accepted an offer from Robinson for free lodging in Overland
Park and job training. She was reported missing Jan. 11 and has not
been seen by friends or relatives since.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison recently amended charges against Robinson, counting
Lisa Stasi dead and making her the sixth woman that Robinson is
charged with killing. Two other women who disappeared after
crossing paths with Robinson in the 1980s also are missing, but he
has not been charged in their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Stasi's daughter, meantime, has been living in the Midwest
under another name with a couple long known to Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   She has been told that the man believed to have brokered her
adoption, Robinson, is suspected of killing her mother. Lawyers
involved in the case say the news has shaken her.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Stasi's mother, Pat Sylvester, said she was glad the
agreement for a father-daughter reunion was sensitive to the
teen-ager's emotional state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little more mature than running out there and saying:
`Hey, I want to see her! I want to see her!' '' said Sylvester, who
has never seen her granddaughter. ``We've got to be patient and
give her time, look at it from her viewpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Stasi's aunt, Karen Moore, also took the agreement as good news
and hoped it would hasten the girl's reunion with her biological
mother's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The better it goes for one side (of the family), the better it
goes for the other side,'' Moore said. ``We just want to be a part
of her life.''

ERIK WILLIAMS IS BACK AT WORK, SAYS HIS HEART `IS IN THE GAME'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Five true sentences about Erik Williams'
end of a four-week holdout with the Dallas Cowboys:
</P>
<P>
   1) The 31-year-old offensive tackle merely watched practice
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   2) Physically, he feels better after missing a full month of
training camp than he has felt in any of his nine previous NFL
preseasons.
</P>
<P>
   3) Williams' return will help Emmitt Smith and the Cowboys'
running game the most.
</P>
<P>
   4) A possible $5,000-a-day fine has been waived in Williams'
case.
</P>
<P>
   5) Cowboys' coaches and players needed to hear one thing in
particular from the four-time Pro Bowl selection: ``My heart is
still in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization knew all along that it needed Williams. But it
knew that it needed Williams to come back on his own terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't ``talk'' somebody into playing this game,'' coach
Dave Campo said. ``I've talked to Erik. His heart is in it.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if this sends a wrong message to the rest of the
players, Campo shook his head and said, ``Everyone is handled on an
individual case.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Campo is going with Williams' story of
contemplating retirement, not holding out for more money. He has a
contract that pays him $1.9 million each of the next two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he has ``just got my head right'' and that his
``only issue'' was over playing football. It had nothing to do with
seeking a trade, Jacksonville or otherwise, and nothing to do with
the wear and tear that 124 NFL games has on an offensive lineman's
body.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how much money you put in front of guy, if he
doesn't love the game anymore ... it's not worth it,'' Williams
said Tuesday. ``I have enough money. I was just at a crossroads.
The last nine years, I've been struggling ... more mentally than
anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a tough decision, and I struggled with it. But I'm
back now and ready to move on. I decided my heart is still in the
game. I'm not ready to let it go yet.''
</P>
<P>
   For Williams, who made his fourth Pro Bowl last season, a
decision to quit football with two years left on his contract would
have cost him $1.6 million in bonus money-to-be-returned.
</P>
<P>
   By his own admission, Williams, who turns 32 next month, is
still two weeks away from being in ``football shape.'' He is fully
expected to be in the Cowboys' starting lineup at right tackle for
the Sept. 3 season opener against Philaelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Erik is going to make us a better team,'' said
quarterback Troy Aikman, who was asked if he really believes that
Williams will be ready for Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope so,'' Aikman replied. ``Physically, I think he'll be
ready to play, although I've been saying all camp that we're doing
a lot of different stuff this year with our protection (schemes).
Still, I think he'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jerry Jones said: ``Erik lost something (with the
holdout). But with hard work, I think he can be where we want him
to be. He never was going to be going twice-a-day in camp because
of his off-season (elbow) surgery. That wouldn't have been smart at
this juncture of his career ... but he would've been better off
having been around it since some of this is new.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams will receive his first limited work against St. Louis
in the Cowboys' preseason finale Aug. 24. Until then, Solomon Page
will continue at right tackle, where he has done a solid job in a
caretaker's role.
</P>
<P>
   When Williams is ready, Page will move to right guard, which
isn't the position that Page prefers. He is a natural right tackle.
Meanwhile, projected backup Jorge Diaz has started at right guard
all preseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more concerned about the 2 1/2 weeks that Solomon Page has
to work at both positions than I am with Erik Williams coming in
and being ready to play,'' Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   Center Mark Stepnoski believes that Page will benefit in
carrying out his new assignment when Williams returns because the
switch involves the same right side of the line.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys offensive line coach Hudson Houck said, ``I think Erik's
return can give us a tremendous lift right now. He brings to our
team some toughness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to have Erik back,'' Page said. ``Our main objective
is to get to a championship (game) and win the Super Bowl, so
whatever it takes to do that ... cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said Tuesday that he most missed the players. As long
as he gets ready, the feeling will be mutual. nn

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I hold in my hand the last will and testament of
Joseph P. DiMaggio, the Yankee Clipper.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, no bombshells therein.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio does appoint ``my dear friend and attorney, Morris
Engelberg, Esq., as Personal Representative of my estate'' in
connection with, among other things, ``the licensing and/or use of
any name ... .''
</P>
<P>
   So if you want to sell Joltin' Joe coffee mugs, you have to deal
with Mo.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody can be granted legal power of playground. If San
Francisco wants to dedicate North Beach Playground in honor of
native-son Joe, there's nothing in Joe's will or the law to prevent
it.
</P>
<P>
   And by the way, whose city is this _ Mo's or Willie's?
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Brown, with a phone call, could have swell Joe DiMaggio
Playground signs posted by tomorrow. How dead does Joe have to get
before his boyhood hometown honors him?
</P>
<P>
   The will, incidentally, cost me $33. That's a bargain because,
even though it's Xerox copies of the 33 pages, I now have 34
different notarized Joseph P. DiMaggio autographs. Maybe I can sell
'em.
</P>
<P>
   LOVED THE president's long walk through the backstage labyrinth
to the stage for Monday night's speech. Where was his dressing
room? Pasadena?
</P>
<P>
   The low camera angle was dramatic, and slimming. But I was
apprehensive, worrying that Clinton might take a wrong turn and
stride purposefully to the valet-parking kiosk.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton finally emerged from the concrete maze, it was a
little bit of a letdown that he wasn't confronted by snarling
lions, or a shadow-boxing Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   How will Gore top that entrance? He'll have to cartwheel and
handspring onto the stage. Or be borne to the podium on a sedan
chair carried by four Laker Girls.
</P>
<P>
   BAR HOPPING, seeking liquid fortification while he watched the
speech, Cuffs Corbett had no luck at the Gold Coast or at
O'Reilly's, where you could watch whatever you wanted as long as it
was Monday Night Football.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the real battle is brewing _ on MNF. Right now the
major polls show new TV analyst Dennis Miller running a distant
third behind the ghost of Howard Cosell and the memory of Dandy Don
Meredith.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone tunes in to MNF, even for worthless practice games, to
see how the new guy Miller is doing.
</P>
<P>
   And by now it's clear that Gore blew it by not naming Dennis
Miller as his running mate. Tell me who you'd rather watch give a
campaign speech _ Dennis Miller or Joe Lieberman?
</P>
<P>
   Miller could sit behind Gore when he speaks, whisper wise-ass
asides that would get Al laughing, cut through the wooden
seriousness that causes him to lag in the polls behind
loosey-goosey Dub.
</P>
<P>
   BESIDES, it's not like the VP has any real power.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood liberals fear Lieberman because he is an outspoken
critic of movie and record violence and sex. So they'd do better
with Bush and Cheney?
</P>
<P>
   Veeps are harmless. Gore's two-fisted agenda when he took office
was fixing the environment and cutting government waste and fat.
But he must have spent too much time in Buddhist temples. Plenty of
incense, and he did inhale.
</P>
<P>
   What major reforming did Dan Quayle, or any other VP, do in
terms of changing society?
</P>
<P>
   THE SECRET of the amazing gardens at Cayuga Playground was
unveiled in Monday's column. City gardener Demi Braceros has
sculpted and planted an acre of treasures.
</P>
<P>
   But how to get there? By BART, get off at the Balboa Park
station, walk downhill on Geneva three blocks, turn right on Cayuga
and go about a half mile, street ends, there you are. From 280,
take the Geneva/Ocean turnoff, go southeast on Geneva, right on
Cayuga.
</P>
<P>
   On maps it's listed as a playground, wedged between 280 and BART
tracks on North and Alemany Boulevard on South.
</P>
<P>
   TIMBERRRR. The city will be murdering between 18 and 27 big
trees in Pioneer Park, at the base of Coit Tower, at the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
   They're paving paradise, putting up a tourist patio, critics
say.
</P>
<P>
   But the local group that put the project together says the new
flagstone terrace on the South side (opposite side of the Tower
from the parking lot) will replace an unplantable dirt hill, and
new stairways will prevent visitors from scrambling over rocks and
through brush.
</P>
<P>
   And the project will make the park more ADA-compliant.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's always good to see concerned citizens putting heat
on the chainsaw man. Just to keep him honest.
</P>
<P>
   WONDER IF his friends call him Sparky:
</P>
<P>
   In a Chronicle story about widespread vandalism of glass, this
quote:
</P>
<P>
   ``They use rocks, sandpaper, even the sharp edges of spark
plugs,'' said Allan Champion... .
</P>
<P>
   FLOWER THEFTS from local parks and gardens?
</P>
<P>
   It's a widespread organized crime now. But a guy named Earl says
that in college he would impress his dates with large bouquets he
happened to find lying around at a local cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   A handy tip from Earl: ``You have to make sure you remove the
card.''
</P>
<P>
   IT'S 49ERS vs. Seattle Seahawks Saturday, and Buchanan Grill
owner Bill Jamison is conflicted.
</P>
<P>
   Big 49er fan, but his boyhood pal and part owner of the Grill is
Mike Holmgren, Seattle coach.
</P>
<P>
   Whom to root for, and what to serve? When Holmgren coached the
Green Bay Packers and they played the 49ers, Jamison would put out
bratwurst and cheese.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you give a Seahawks' fan?'' he asks. ``Starbucks?''
</P>
<P>
   Nah. Light a match and set off the sprinklers, Bill, give 'em a
little rain.

 DEMOCRATS CEDE CHARM CONTEST TO GOV. BUSH  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Democrats are painfully aware that the man they
will nominate as their standard-bearer tonight lacks the political
charm of his Republican opponent.
</P>
<P>
   For all his efforts to appear informal, down to earth, sincere
and spontaneous, Vice President Al Gore still has trouble simply
being likable.
</P>
<P>
   So while Republicans used their party's convention in
Philadelphia two weeks ago to promote integrity, decency and
leadership as paramount presidential qualities, Democrats in Los
Angeles are obsessed with matters of policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't just want compassion,'' roared Rep. Patrick
Kennedy, D-R.I., mocking the mantra of the GOP nominee, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want access to safe schools, a Medicare prescription drug
benefit, a real patient's bill of rights, civil rights protections
and an environment that they can pass on to their children,''
Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as both parties hew toward the political center and exhibit
their talent for putting on events that refuse to stray from the
script, a clear-cut difference is emerging from their conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans believe if the 2000 election is fought over
character, they have the advantage, while Democrats believe if it
is fought over issues, they have the edge.
</P>
<P>
   At the risk of inducing yawns from the prime-time audience,
speaker after speaker in Los Angeles is taking on prescription
drugs for seniors, a patient's bill of rights, HMO reform, campaign
finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   A list of talking points distributed to delegates last night
referred to health care, the environment, targeted tax cuts, Social
Security, economic growth and education.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware distributed copies of a 64-page paper
titled: ``A Choice for the Generations: Presidential Election
2000,'' which details the stark differences between the parties on
``judicial imperialism'' and a national missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win, we have got to draw distinctions,'' said Biden, who
was himself a candidate for president in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton had likability and the issues going for him,'' Biden
said. ``George Bush is a good guy. Right now, Bush is likable in
the minds of the public. ... I'm confident we can win, but it's no
slam dunk. It's going to be hard.''
</P>
<P>
   A poll published in Tuesday's Los Angeles Times provided fresh
evidence that while voters agree with Gore on the issues, they like
Bush better as a leader.
</P>
<P>
   The nationwide survey of 1,227 registered voters found that 6 in
10 respondents said they had a favorable impression of Bush. Even
among Democrats, 28 percent said they viewed Bush favorably. By
contrast, 54 percent of the respondents had a positive impression
of Gore, but just 17 percent of Republicans viewed him favorably.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why Gov. Bush is in the lead, because people sense he
is a leader,'' said Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said he believes that voters will be drawn to Bush's
position on tax cuts, school vouchers and a strong national
defense. But, he acknowledges: ``I think we're on stronger ground
on the character issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The same poll found that voters strongly back Gore's positions
on the issues. By a 5-to-1 ratio, voters said the federal budget
surplus should be used primarily to pay down the national debt and
stabilize Social Security and Medicare, as Gore advocates, rather
than for tax cuts as Bush has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Other polls show that the public generally supports Gore's
positions on gun control, legal abortions, stronger environmental
protections and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues are on our side,'' said Sen. Dianne Feinstein,
D-California.
</P>
<P>
   Each party's effort to woo swing voters in the political center
may make it difficult to distinguish between their positions on
many issues. Both party platforms profess to strengthen education,
preserve Social Security and promote the e-economy, though their
approaches are different. On trade and national defense, each
candidate's position is far more similar than different.
</P>
<P>
   Still, stark differences remain on matters ranging from tax cuts
and gun control to abortion and gay rights. Feinstein, like many
other Democrats, has expressed confidence that Gore can overtake
Bush in the fall when issues will become more prominent and the two
candidates will meet in a series of at least three debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you need to know about this election,'' Kennedy said, ``is
that we want people to know what the issues are. And the
Republicans don't.''

HALL, ERWIN PARTNERS IN SPEED   AT TRIALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Gary Hall Jr. has borne the weight of exorbitant
expectations since birth, the inevitable consequence of being the
namesake of a three-time Olympian. Anthony Ervin has faced the
weight of people's presumptions since, well, Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The two sprint teammates arrived at the starting blocks for the
50-meter freestyle at the U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials from
decidedly different planes Tuesday but wound up in the same place:
Under the existing American record set 10 years ago by Tom Jager.
Hall got to the wall first, touching in 21.76 to Ervin's 21.80.
Jager clocked a 21.81 in a special sprint event in March of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   No one has gone faster than Hall or Ervin in a competitive
eight-man race (Russia's Alexander Popov set the world record of
21.64 in June in a one-man time trial). Their dazzling two-man show
came as no great shock, considering there's arguably no more
conducive training atmosphere for sprinters than the one created
this summer by former USC standout Mike Bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, 25, and Ervin, a sophomore-to-be at Cal, are two of 10
world-caliber freestyle sprint specialists who work out together
daily in Phoenix. Cal head coach Nort Thornton, who recruited Ervin
out of Hart High, said the setup is tailor-made for Valencia's
human vapor trail, and Ervin had to agree.
</P>
<P>
   Left to his own, Ervin admitted, ``I set up standards a lot
lower for myself than what I'm capable of doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ervin's rise has been so meteoric, it's a small wonder he can
measure his ceiling at all. He was a two-time CIF champion in 1999
but came to Cal clueless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think before my first college year, I was kind of
overwhelmed by the whole thing,'' Ervin said. ``I had no idea what
was going on, really.''
</P>
<P>
   He proved himself a quick study. The 19-year-old won the 50 and
100 freestyles at the NCAA Championships in March as a freshman,
something not even former world-record-holder Matt Biondi was able
to do during his celebrated career at Cal in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The meet was conducted in a short course meters pool and Ervin's
winning time in the 50 established a new short course world record
and established himself as someone to watch here.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, a 1996 Olympian, has the thicker dossier but his swim was
in some ways more startling than Ervin's. Hall had been swimming
largely below Popov's and the rest of the swimming world's radar
since being diagnosed with diabetes in March of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   To battle the disease and at the same time beat Jager's mark was
an accomplishment so special, Hall struggled to make sense of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a record that up until not too long ago was almost
unattainable,'' said Hall, whose father, Gary Sr., won three
Olympic swimming medals between 1968 and 1976. ``It's something
I've been gunning for for a long time. To pass it is really
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Ervin unwittingly had caused a commotion on Sunday when he
earned an Olympic berth as a member of the 400-meter freestyle
relay. Ervin's father, Jack, is three-fourths African-American and
so Ervin became the first swimmer of African-American descent to
grace a U.S. Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   It was of more significance to others than to Ervin, who
explained, ``It's not that I'm trying to understate the fact I'm
African-American. Hopefully I can be a role model for just about
anybody, whether they're black or white or brown.''
</P>
<P>
   IN OTHER FINALS: Ian Crocker set an Olympic Trials record in the
100 butterfly (52.78); defending Olympic champion Brooke Bennett
won the 800 freestyle (8:23.92); and Amanda Adkins edged Trojan
Swim Club's Lindsay Benko in the 200 backstroke (2:12.97 to
2:13.19). &QL;

GORE RUNNING MATE MOVES TO REASSURE BLACK CAUCUS ON
AFFIRMATIVE  ACTION
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW and CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In an early test of his skills on the national
political stage, Sen. Joe Lieberman moved Tuesday to extinguish
smoldering doubts about his commitment to affirmative action and
public education.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of a prime time address that will serve to introduce
the two-term Connecticut Senator to the rest of the country,
Lieberman assured black delegates that despite misgivings earlier
in his career, he would not stray from the party's orthodoxy on
either matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel as if I'm with family,'' Lieberman said as he faced the
delicate task of explaining his centrist positions to the decidedly
liberal members of the Democrat's African American caucus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let the press or our opponents divide us,'' he said
before receiving a warm embrace from Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif.,
who had raised questions about Lieberman only a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight Lieberman faces the broader challenge of explaining to a
national audience why a man who was Stamford High School prom king
in 1960 and the Democratic Party's voice of conscience during the
Monica Lewinsky scandal four decades, later deserves the
opportunity to be a heartbeat away from the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Since his selection last week, Lieberman has displayed abundant
loyalty to Gore and enormous enthusiasm to be running for a job
often belittled by politicians for being of little consequence.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at the convention podium for a brief morning
rehearsal, Lieberman smiled and spread his arms as if to embrace
his new campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``An only-in-America moment,'' he said to a group of
photographers.
</P>
<P>
   In a preview of his remarks, Lieberman said he would not
hesitate to ``respectfully'' point out disagreements with Gov.
George W. Bush, but that he would shun the traditional running mate
role of attack dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to Al about this, and we're very intent on talking
about progress, not partisanship,'' Lieberman said in an interview
with the New York Times. ``This is not going to be a campaign of
personal attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is the first Jew to be named to either party's
national ticket. Has presence has helped cut into Bush's double
digit lead in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Rainbow Coalition leader Jesse Jackson applauded the selection
during an address to the convention last night, saying that by
choosing Lieberman ``Al Gore has brought the sons and daughters of
slaves and slave masters together with the sons and daughters of
Holocaust survivors.''
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, Lieberman entered the convention hall, where
he was greeted by a rush of supporters, news cameras, and a roaring
ovation from the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Los Angeles, created the first crack in
the Democrat's show of unity Monday by suggesting that she was not
ready to support the Democratic ticket until she learned more about
Lieberman's record on affirmative action and school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who as a college student in 1963 spent a summer in
Mississippi working to register blacks to vote, strode into
Tuesday's meeting with African American delegates escorted by black
cabinet members Alexis Herman and Rodney Slater.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want Joe! We want Joe!'' chanted the crowd at the Westin
Bonaventure hotel which is hosting most of the California
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Smiling, Lieberman responded: ``You've got him!''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said that ``there's been a misunderstanding'' on his
views on affirmative action. He explained that his initial support
for California's proposition 209 in 1996 was based upon a
preliminary reading over the phone by a reporter, and not a
thorough exploration of its implications. He said he later refused
to sign latter endorsing the measure, which banned preferences in
state hiring, contracting, and school admissions based on race, and
was ultimately approved by voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have supported affirmative action, I do support affirmative
action and I will support affirmative action,` he said, to
applause.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman acknowledged that he differed from Gore on whether
public money should be used to help students attend private
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a fact I have supported some demonstration programs for
vouchers,'' he said. ``But let me make real clear that the focus of
my attention and the main support that I've always given has been
to the public schools, because that's where most of our children
will be educated.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman then announced that it was Waters' 62nd birthday and
led the group in singing ``Happy Birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   Water later told reporters: ``I feel a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   `I'll campaign with him,'' Water said. ``I feel comfortable in
campaigning for him. I was not going to do it and lose credibility
if these issues had not been clarified.''
</P>
<P>
   Another group of influential Democrats may not be so quick to
embrace Lieberman. Executives from the entertainment industry have
expressed concerns about Lieberman's strong views regarding
violence on television and in movies, and his call for the industry
to either police itself or face some form of government action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I love the movies. I love music,`` he said on ABC's
``This Week.'' ``But there is still too much violence, too much
sex, too much incivility in entertainment, which makes it very
difficult for parents, who are working so hard to give their kids
values and discipline.''
</P>

ABOUT 75 ARRESTED IN LATEST WAVE OF DNC PROTESTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY ANDERSON, DOMINIC BERBEO, JASON KANDEL and JORDAN SMITH 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Police clamped down on unruly demonstrations in
downtown Los Angeles on Tuesday, a day after the LAPD response to a
melee at a protest concert outside Staples Center sparked
controversy and threats of court action.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 people were arrested as riot-gear-clad police rushed
from one protest scene to another in conjunction with the
Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The protests were by-and-large peaceful, mainly centering on
families, with groups of teachers, county employees and others
demonstrating for gay rights and more government help for families,
women and children.
</P>
<P>
   But police quickly responded to a handful of incidents:
</P>
<P>
   -- Forty-five anti-fur protesters, clad all in black with
bandannas covering their faces, were arrested on suspicion of
conspiracy to commit vandalism about 2:30p.m., several found with
firecrackers and other items police termed as weapons.
</P>
<P>
   -- Later Tuesday, about 30 bicyclists were arrested out of a
group of several hundred who rode through city streets supporting
more bike lanes and promoting the environment.
</P>
<P>
   -- Police toyed with a black-clad protest group called the Black
Block, surrounding the group several times in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   -- According to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, some
subway runs were delayed because of protesters standing on the
tracks at above-ground stations.
</P>
<P>
   -- Police closed an intersection around 8:30 p.m. after a crowd
of 75 headed to Parker Center to demand the release of protesters
who were arrested earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Civil libertarians were critical of the afternoon arrests and
the police actions and threatened to go back to federal court to
restrain Los Angeles Police Department officers. But the day after
the melee, police were swarming to meet any potential problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a huge show of police force, and arrests today were
questionable,'' said Marlene Furth, observer for the National
Lawyers Guild. ``But other than that, there was generally
restraint.''
</P>
<P>
   She said officers were hiding their badge numbers and names,
against LAPD policy, ``but the fact that so many people have video
recorders is definitely a deterrent to the police. They know
they're being watched.''
</P>
<P>
   In the incident on Olive Street, police and witnesses said the
protesters pounded on the doors of Edward Borovay Furs, chanted
death threats to workers inside and destroyed a sign.
</P>
<P>
   But Sally Roeker, an office worker who witnessed the arrests,
said the group ``didn't seem to be doing anything wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of officers and cars poured into the area and police
detained the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   According to LAPD spokesman Cmdr. David Kalish, many of the
protesters were carrying aerosol cans converted to be ``mini-flame
throwers,'' containers with fuses, fireworks and flares altered to
be weapons, flammable liquids and sling shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not sure I would characterize this group as protesters,''
he said, but he declined to comment on how he would characterize
them.
</P>
<P>
   Kalish said police learned that the group, which one officer
called ``anarchist,'' planned to march to McDonald's and commit
vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   They were stopped after allegedly destroying a sign on Olive.
</P>
<P>
   Police slowly cataloged all the protesters' possessions,
photographed them and led them aboard three waiting buses.
</P>
<P>
   There were 15 juveniles and 30 adults arrested. There were no
injuries reported and only minimal damage, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what happens when you stand up for what you believe
in,'' one protester yelled from the bus, trying to flash a peace
sign while cuffed. ``We were doing nothing wrong but walking down
the sidewalk.''
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Kerns, 17, was among those arrested. The Calabasas teen
said he's a spokesman for the Animal Defense League. Wearing a
shirt that read Vegan Militia, Kerns said, ``We are peaceful
demonstrators. We are protesting the use of animals for fur
coats.''
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, about 200 bicyclists streamed through downtown
on a Critical Mass bike ride, to show there is an alternative to
cars even in congested downtown L.A.
</P>
<P>
   The cyclists rode for about 45 minutes with a police escort of
about 80 officers on bicycles and dozens more in police cars.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said when the riders went under a freeway overpass,
officers cut them off and that motorcycles sideswiped riders and
officers on foot hit cyclists with batons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were trapping people in alleys and under freeways, all
the dark places,'' said a Los Angeles woman who only gave her first
name as Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   Kit Reilly of Santa Cruz, a veteran Critical Mass rider, said he
never had any trouble on any ride before.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got off their bikes holding their clubs and told us to
get off our bikes,'' Reilly said. ``But they never gave us any
reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Police would not immediately comment on whether the riders were
being arrested and, if so, what they were being arrested for. Those
detained had their bikes impounded.
</P>
<P>
   A bike rider yelled that she was being arrested for ``reckless
driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Other protests went smoothly, all under the watchful eye of
hundreds of police officers.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 protesters in the ``queers and allies march''
traveled from Pershing Square to the Federal Building and back
without incident.
</P>
<P>
   They chanted, ``What do we want? Gay rights.''
</P>
<P>
   They lay in the intersection of Temple Avenue and Los Angeles
Street and outlined their figures in a ``die-in'' representing
death resulting from brutality against homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to express our demands for gay rights,'' said Ray
Fernandez, a participant. ``They have no reason to use violence. We
are peaceful.''
</P>
<P>
   Other activists stayed in and around Pershing Square, the center
of activity.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Campbell, a 36-year-old member of the Peace and Freedom
Party, rode from San Francisco on his BMW motorcycle to join the
protests.

   ``Protests are good for the media to let people know what the
issues are and who the players are,'' he said. ``But after the
convention's over, you've got to hook up, get in one of these
organizations and get into the long-term day-to-day issues.''

DODGERS FADING FAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Ismael Valdes pitched a mop-up ninth inning in which the
Dodgers were getting pounded by the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   It's not quite the role the Dodgers envisioned for Valdes when
they re-acquired him last month as the veteran pitcher needed for
the playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, getting trashed by the Marlins for the second
straight night, this time 7-3 Tuesday at Pro Player Stadium, brings
the Dodgers a little bit closer to a meaningless last few weeks of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely playing like (garbage). We're absolutely
playing like (garbage)'' second baseman Mark Grudzielanek said.
``We're not getting many bounces, we're not giving ourselves a
chance to win a game. We're too good for that to happen. We should
be in most of the games and we should have a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making mistakes, making bad pitches. Everything that's
going wrong is going wrong at once. ... We're not hitting, not
pitching, no defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The floundering Dodgers (60-58) have lost eight of 10, with six
of the losses to Milwaukee, Chicago and the Marlins. They are now 6
1/2 games behind San Francisco in the National League West and have
as many wins as the young, energetic Marlins (60-59).
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have tried team meetings, have talked in small
circles in the clubhouse, and yet no remedy has been found. Not
even the clearing of the air with manager Davey Johnson being told
he'd be back for the remainder of the season has eased the cloud of
a long, often distraction-ridden season.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the get-go this year, things were just not right,''
Grudzielanek said. ``No question we do have a playoff team here,
and there's still time left. But there's no question the door is
shutting, and we need to do something about it. Are we going to
fall on our faces like we have the last week or are we going to
bounce back and make a run at it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody bought a ticket for a roller coaster ride.
It's like we're waiting for something to happen and it's not
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The frustration certainly has bubbled over for all-star left
fielder Gary Sheffield, who was ejected for the first time this
year _ for laying his bat down after an eighth-inning strikeout to
show home plate umpire Dan Iassogna that he thought the ball was
outside.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield's seen fewer and fewer good pitches to hit because
nobody in the lineup is producing. The Dodgers have scored more
than three runs only six times in the last 17 games. And Sheffield
is 2 for 20 on the five-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's three weeks of frustration building up,'' said Sheffield,
who didn't know he was ejected until he was told by crew chief Mark
Hirschbeck. ``I haven't seen a ball down the middle of the plate in
three weeks. I know the strike zone in and out. When I swing with
two strikes I make a weak out, and when I take it I strike out.''
</P>
<P>
   During a time in which the Dodgers are supposed to be whuppin'
up on the financially-challenged clubs that often occupy the
cellars, they are getting beaten up themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Marlins right-hander Ryan Dempster, a fine young pitcher with a
strong fastball and nasty slider, allowed three hits in eight
innings. The only run Dempster gave up came on F.P. Santangelo's
pinch hit homer to lead off the eighth. Except for Chad Kreuter's
two-run double in the ninth, the score would have indicated how
dismal this loss was.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two games of the series, which included a start by
Kevin Brown, the Dodgers have been outscored 18-5. The Dodgers have
also made four errors, allowed five unearned runs and played the
type of fundamentally inept baseball that's followed them the last
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't play good enough to win,'' Johnson said. ``We
didn't swing the bats well. We didn't set the table, didn't hit. If
you don't do that, you better catch it and you better pitch.'' &QL;

ABOUT 75 ARRESTED IN LATEST WAVE OF DNC PROTESTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY ANDERSON, DOMINIC BERBEO, JASON KANDEL and JORDAN SMITH 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Police clamped down on unruly demonstrations in
downtown Los Angeles on Tuesday, a day after the LAPD response to a
melee at a protest concert outside Staples Center sparked
controversy and threats of court action.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 people were arrested as riot-gear-clad police rushed
from one protest scene to another in conjunction with the
Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The protests were by-and-large peaceful, mainly centering on
families, with groups of teachers, county employees and others
demonstrating for gay rights and more government help for families,
women and children.
</P>
<P>
   But police quickly responded to a handful of incidents:
</P>
<P>
   -- Forty-five anti-fur protesters, clad all in black with
bandannas covering their faces, were arrested on suspicion of
conspiracy to commit vandalism about 2:30p.m., several found with
firecrackers and other items police termed as weapons.
</P>
<P>
   -- Later Tuesday, about 30 bicyclists were arrested out of a
group of several hundred who rode through city streets supporting
more bike lanes and promoting the environment.
</P>
<P>
   -- Police toyed with a black-clad protest group called the Black
Block, surrounding the group several times in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   -- According to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, some
subway runs were delayed because of protesters standing on the
tracks at above-ground stations.
</P>
<P>
   -- Police closed an intersection around 8:30 p.m. after a crowd
of 75 headed to Parker Center to demand the release of protesters
who were arrested earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Civil libertarians were critical of the afternoon arrests and
the police actions and threatened to go back to federal court to
restrain Los Angeles Police Department officers. But the day after
the melee, police were swarming to meet any potential problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a huge show of police force, and arrests today were
questionable,'' said Marlene Furth, observer for the National
Lawyers Guild. ``But other than that, there was generally
restraint.''
</P>
<P>
   She said officers were hiding their badge numbers and names,
against LAPD policy, ``but the fact that so many people have video
recorders is definitely a deterrent to the police. They know
they're being watched.''
</P>
<P>
   In the incident on Olive Street, police and witnesses said the
protesters pounded on the doors of Edward Borovay Furs, chanted
death threats to workers inside and destroyed a sign.
</P>
<P>
   But Sally Roeker, an office worker who witnessed the arrests,
said the group ``didn't seem to be doing anything wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of officers and cars poured into the area and police
detained the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   According to LAPD spokesman Cmdr. David Kalish, many of the
protesters were carrying aerosol cans converted to be ``mini-flame
throwers,'' containers with fuses, fireworks and flares altered to
be weapons, flammable liquids and sling shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not sure I would characterize this group as protesters,''
he said, but he declined to comment on how he would characterize
them.
</P>
<P>
   Kalish said police learned that the group, which one officer
called ``anarchist,'' planned to march to McDonald's and commit
vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   They were stopped after allegedly destroying a sign on Olive.
</P>
<P>
   Police slowly cataloged all the protesters' possessions,
photographed them and led them aboard three waiting buses.
</P>
<P>
   There were 15 juveniles and 30 adults arrested. There were no
injuries reported and only minimal damage, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what happens when you stand up for what you believe
in,'' one protester yelled from the bus, trying to flash a peace
sign while cuffed. ``We were doing nothing wrong but walking down
the sidewalk.''
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Kerns, 17, was among those arrested. The Calabasas teen
said he's a spokesman for the Animal Defense League. Wearing a
shirt that read Vegan Militia, Kerns said, ``We are peaceful
demonstrators. We are protesting the use of animals for fur
coats.''
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, about 200 bicyclists streamed through downtown
on a Critical Mass bike ride, to show there is an alternative to
cars even in congested downtown L.A.
</P>
<P>
   The cyclists rode for about 45 minutes with a police escort of
about 80 officers on bicycles and dozens more in police cars.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said when the riders went under a freeway overpass,
officers cut them off and that motorcycles sideswiped riders and
officers on foot hit cyclists with batons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were trapping people in alleys and under freeways, all
the dark places,'' said a Los Angeles woman who only gave her first
name as Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   Kit Reilly of Santa Cruz, a veteran Critical Mass rider, said he
never had any trouble on any ride before.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got off their bikes holding their clubs and told us to
get off our bikes,'' Reilly said. ``But they never gave us any
reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Police would not immediately comment on whether the riders were
being arrested and, if so, what they were being arrested for. Those
detained had their bikes impounded.
</P>
<P>
   A bike rider yelled that she was being arrested for ``reckless
driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Other protests went smoothly, all under the watchful eye of
hundreds of police officers.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 protesters in the ``queers and allies march''
traveled from Pershing Square to the Federal Building and back
without incident.
</P>
<P>
   They chanted, ``What do we want? Gay rights.''
</P>
<P>
   They lay in the intersection of Temple Avenue and Los Angeles
Street and outlined their figures in a ``die-in'' representing
death resulting from brutality against homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to express our demands for gay rights,'' said Ray
Fernandez, a participant. ``They have no reason to use violence. We
are peaceful.''
</P>
<P>
   Other activists stayed in and around Pershing Square, the center
of activity.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Campbell, a 36-year-old member of the Peace and Freedom
Party, rode from San Francisco on his BMW motorcycle to join the
protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Protests are good for the media to let people know what the
issues are and who the players are,'' he said. ``But after the
convention's over, you've got to hook up, get in one of these
organizations and get into the long-term day-to-day issues.''

PERCIVAL NOT READY YET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Closer Troy Percival played catch Tuesday afternoon
but isn't ready to return to the active roster. Percival's inflamed
right elbow will keep him out at least two more weeks and probably
longer even though he's eligible to come off the disabled list on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Percival injured the elbow by compensating for his surgically
repaired shoulder. He said his shoulder went ``dead'' for a while
earlier this season, a normal reaction for somebody coming off
surgery. However, as a result, Percival dropped down from his
normal three-quarters arm angle to nearly sidearm, putting extra
strain on the elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Percival had elbow surgery in 1993 but said the current injury
``isn't the same area exactly. It's not the ligament. The elbow's
sound. The nerve flared up.''
</P>
<P>
   The inflamed nerve causes a sharp pain in Percival's elbow.
Although his velocity hasn't been affected, he has trouble locating
his pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Mike Scioscia met privately with Percival for nearly a
half-hour Tuesday afternoon, but Percival said the meeting was only
``semantics.'' Percival said he sees no reason he can't come back
100 percent. If not this season, then next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing left to fix in there now,'' he said. ``... As
long as I know I'll have time to rest in the offseason, my strength
will be back. I know I will be back where I want to be. There are
days this year I felt like the old me, but not for more than three
or four outings.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival, though, won't give up on returning to the mound this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we are in a race like we are right now ... I'm going to
be back out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   TOUGH STRETCH: Despite going 3 for 5 on Tuesday, Darin Erstad
has hit only .225 (18 for 80) in his past 18 games, his average
falling from .382 on July 25 to .358.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad is working to get out of the slump, taking extra batting
practice with hitting coach Mickey Hatcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason during the course of a season you lose your
rhythm, your feeling,'' Erstad said. ``All I'm trying to do is get
my rhythm back. For whatever reason, it's not working together. But
I'm trying to get it back as quickly as I can. I just want to get
comfortable and get into a good flow.''
</P>
<P>
   With 184 hits in 119 games, Erstad is on pace for 250 hits,
which would equal the fifth-highest total in a single season in
baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   SHAKY START: Pitcher Brian Cooper gave up six runs and seven
hits in five innings in a start for Triple-A Edmonton on Monday, an
indication he isn't ready to rejoin the team and start Saturday
against the Yankees when the club needs a fifth starter.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' other options within the organization are few.
Relievers Mike Fyhrie and Al Levine were considered candidates, but
Fyhrie is on the DL and Levine will only be activated from the DL
on Saturday and won't be stretched out enough to go more than a few
innings. The club will not consider anyone other than Cooper among
minor leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia said they could ``piecemeal a game together,''
stringing together a series of relievers.
</P>
<P>
   The final option would be to acquire a pitcher off the waiver
wire, and there is growing speculation that will happen if the
Angels can find the right deal.
</P>
<P>
   NOT READY: Pitcher Seth Etherton (tendinitis right shoulder) is
eligible to come off the DL on Sunday, but he won't be ready.
Etherton has not resumed throwing. He's still working with weights
to regain strength. &QL;

 VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT A NEW LEADER IN OIL POLITICS  &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a new power player on the world stage. He hangs out with
Washington's archenemies, and he causes American motorists to wince
every time they pull up at the gas pump.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has used his country's oil
wealth as a springboard to notoriety, hobnobbing in the past week
with Saddam Hussein and Moammar Khadafy.
</P>
<P>
   But strangely enough, there's common ground between Chavez's
anti-Americanism and U.S. energy needs. Instead of winding up in
the U.S. doghouse, as might be expected, Chavez has become a tacit
ally.
</P>
<P>
   Since he took office in February 1999, Chavez has rallied the
world's oil powers to cut production and boost the price of crude
oil, causing international prices to triple.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have taken it in the pocketbook, with average gas
prices rising from about $1 per gallon to more than $1.50 in the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez ended a 10-nation trip Tuesday that included visits to
Iraq and Libya. He drummed up support within the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries _ which Venezuela currently chairs _
to resist pressure from the United States and other oil consumers
to boost production and thus lower prices, which now are near their
highest level since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, the American reaction to such a Third World
upstart probably would have been harsh, many analysts say. This
time, however, two disparate factors _ liberal tolerance and
oil-industry pragmatism _ have combined to produce a different
stance.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has barely blinked at Chavez's
campaign, and its criticisms have been mild and infrequent.
</P>
<P>
   When Chavez last week became the first foreign leader to visit
Hussein since the Gulf War, criticizing U.S. sanctions,
Washington's response reflected frustration and ambivalence. State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher called the trip
``inappropriate'' and ``hard to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   But the White House later softened the tone, with a spokesman
saying U.S. officials understand that Chavez has a leadership role
in OPEC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chavez wouldn't have lasted long if we still were in the Cold
War,'' said Terry Karl, director of Stanford University's Center
for Latin American Studies, who is an expert on international oil
policy. ``The U.S. reaction to Chavez has been much more
moderate.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Falcoff, a Latin America analyst at the American Enterprise
Institute, a conservative Washington think tank, said: ``Chavez is
trying to provoke the administration into a very strong response,
very similar to what (Fidel) Castro was trying to do at the same
stage of the game (in the early 1960s).
</P>
<P>
   ``But the administration doesn't want to make the same mistake
as with Castro, causing a complete break. The United States needs
(Chavez's) oil, and he needs our dollars. It's a slap in the face,
but we've simply decided it's not a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   When the populist firebrand Chavez took office in February 1999,
he overturned not just Venezuela's corrupt political establishment
but also the country's traditional role as a U.S. surrogate in
OPEC.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, Venezuela had acted as spoiler of the 11-nation
cartel, which produces about 40 percent of the world's oil. By
constantly exceeding its production quotas _ ``cheating,'' as
industry insiders say _ Venezuela had helped weaken OPEC and drive
oil prices down from their historic highs during the 1970s oil
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   When Chavez took power, oil prices were at $9 a barrel for
high-grade crude, the lowest price in decades. He quickly ended
Venezuela's cheating and joined with Mexico and Saudi Arabia to
convince fellow oil exporters to limit production growth. The
strategy succeeded beyond expectations, driving the price to $32.
</P>
<P>
   Although Vice President Al Gore has made a big campaign issue of
the current high oil and gas prices, he has not pointed up the role
of foreign oil prices in raising U.S. domestic energy costs. GOP
candidate George W. Bush has also not emphasized the issue.
</P>
<P>
   All three have ties to oil firms _ Gore's family owns stock in
Occidental Petroleum Corp., and Bush and Cheney are former oil
company executives.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy experts say the U.S. tolerance for Chavez is
partly prompted by the fact that he has not interfered with U.S.
oil companies' operations in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite his rhetoric, Chavez has respected all (foreign)
contracts. His position has been cautious,'' said Luis Giusti, whom
Chavez fired as CEO of Petroleos de Venezuela, the state-owned oil
conglomerate, in a dispute over Giusti's support for privatizing
the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Even many U.S. foreign policy hawks take a pragmatic line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main U.S. interest is to get a continued, steady supply of
oil,'' said Robert Pastorino, a professor at San Francisco State
University and the National Security Council director for Latin
America for former president George Bush. ``All Venezuelan
governments, including Chavez, have been good at keeping the spigot
open. The price level is less important than that it continue to
flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Next month, U.S. tolerance will be tested again, as Chavez hosts
a summit meeting of OPEC heads of state. Chavez will use the
summit, OPEC's first since 1975, to rally support for his proposal
to create a price ``band'' for oil. Under the plan, producers would
cut production if the price of a ``basket'' of oil grades falls
below $22 per barrel, and would increase pumping if the price goes
above $28 (the basket's current price).
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want prices to fall below their current levels,''
Chavez said Monday. ``If that happened, it would be a death
sentence for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``OPEC isn't the devil that developed countries try to paint us
as. What we want is a fair price, not a high price.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Chavez gets a surprisingly sympathetic ear in
Washington _ although no one in power will admit it, say Karl and
other experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prices that fluctuate wildly are not a good thing for the
producing countries, but they're also not good for the oil
companies,'' said Karl, explaining that the firms need price
stability to be able to calculate their investments. ``If OPEC can
help deliver stability around $25, that's higher than U.S.
consumers want, but there would be no (government) complaints.''

KENNEDYS EVOKE CAMELOT IN ENDORSING GORE TICKET
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI and LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ Capping an emotional journey that recalled the
glories of Camelot, Sen. Ted Kennedy issued an impassioned plea
Tuesday night to continue fighting for the ideals of his late
brother's ``New Frontier'' by working to elect of Al Gore and Joe
Lieberman.
<P>
   ``You have it in our power to take America to new heights,''
Kennedy said to the cheers of sign-waving delegates at the
Democratic National Convention in the Staples Center. ``That is our
challenge. That is our new frontier. Cross it we can _ and cross it
we must.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's rousing call to action capped a parade of family
speakers _ including Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, the only
surviving member of the late president's immediate family, and
Maryland Lieutenant Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend _ all recalling
how, four decades ago, John F. Kennedy was nominated for president
by Democrats in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can make the world new again, if only we try,`' Schlossberg
said. ``That is what my father sought to do 40 years ago in this
city, when he stood before you and declared the opening of the New
Frontier.''
</P>
<P>
   The evening was designed to fire up Democratic progressives for
the coming election battles at a time when the party has taken a
clear turn to the moderate middle. But on the second night of the
convention here, informally dubbed ``liberal night,'' the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, former Sen. Bill Bradley and Tennessee Rep. Harold
Ford were among those who urged Democrats to cleave to their
party's ideals, fight for health care and stand up for the
dispossessed.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals capped a day in which Democratic vice presidential
candidate Joseph Lieberman managed to allay fears of a more
progressive delegation of African American Democrats by pledging to
support affirmative action and public schools.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a carefully scripted rally, President Clinton and Al
Gore appeared side by side in Michigan to commemorate a ``passing
of the torch'' as Gore made his way to the convention center.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, in a surprise move, created an uproar among delegates
when he made a impromptu tour of the convention floor to chants of
``Let's Go Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was the appearance of Schlossberg, the only surviving
family member of the late president, who brought tears to the eyes
of many delegates. Arriving at the podium to the strains of
``Camelot,'' a resounding ovation and a sea of blue ``Caroline''`
signs, Schlossberg's voice occasionally trembled as she urged
Democrats to continue her father's dream.
</P>
<P>
   In a bittersweet moment recalling her late mother, Jacqueline
Kennedy and her brother, John F. Kennedy Jr., Schlossberg said: ``I
thank all Americans for making me, John, and all our family, a part
of your family... for reaching out and sustaining us in the good
times and the difficult ones.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But as I look out across this hall and across this country, I
know that my father's spirit lives on, and I thank all of you,''
Schlossberg said. ``Now it is our turn to prove that the New
Frontier was not a place in time, but a timeless call.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlossberg urged Democrats to fight for ``a president who is
not afraid of complexity, who believes in an open and tolerant
society, and who knows that te world can be made new again,'' she
said. ``And that president is Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the poor and underprivileged, she added, ``We cannot fail
their trust. We cannot fail to try.''
</P>
<P>
   Townsend, daughter of the late Senator Robert F. Kennedy,
likewise recalled her uncle's political legacy and the Democrats'
last meeting in Los Angeles four decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made history by summoning the best of our country,
challenging Americans to serve, and insisting that everyone have a
place in that new frontier,'' she said. ``This year, with renewed
resolve, we'll make history again.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was her uncle, the Massachusetts senator, who roused the
delegates into a near frenzy, asking: ``Will we dare to dream of a
far horizon _ or will we look inward, look backward, lower our
sights and narrow our vision? That is the choice we face in the
election of 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who just months ago engaged in a bitter battle for the
Democratic nomination, issued a gracious endorsement of his former
rival, asking Democrats: ``Are we going back to the politics of
haves and have nots?''
</P>
<P>
   Of Gore, he said to cheers: ``I support him, I endorse him. I'll
work hard for him.'' He called electing Gore and Lieberman ``the
right thing to do for our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The evening delivered Democrats with the red meat that many on
the floor clearly craved. Jackson had the crowd chanting ``Stay out
of the Bushes'' as he pointedly reminded them that the GOP is ``not
just Bush and Cheney, but grizzled old veterans such as Jesse Helms
and Dick Armey and Tom DeLay and Bob Barr and Strom Thurmond.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee Rep. Harold Ford, 30, an up-and-coming party star,
delivered a keynote address designed to showcase Gore and the work
he is committed to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say to all those in my generation and to all Americans who
share in our spirit: If you want a future that belongs to you _ if
you want a future that is for everyone _ then join with us to make
Al Gore and Joe Lieberman the next president and Joe Lieberman as
the next vice president,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the celebrities in the vast convention hall were Jerry
Springer, Tom Arnold, Christopher Reeve and model Christie Brinkley
_ a New York delegate.
</P>
<P>
   Protests outside the convention hall were mainly quiet as
demonstrators and police spent most of the day arguing over the
police's use of force the night before.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism came after officers fired pepper spray, tear gas
and rubber bullets at fleering crowds after 15,000 gathered for a
concert by the group Rage Against the Machine.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles police officials, however, defended their
department's actions, insisting that officers delivered a
``measured, strategic, appropriate response'' to the potentially
volatile action in the streets.

ABOUT 75 ARRESTED IN LATEST WAVE OF DNC PROTESTS

   LOS ANGELES _ Police clamped down on unruly demonstrations in
downtown Los Angeles on Tuesday, a day after the LAPD response to a
melee at a protest concert outside Staples Center sparked
controversy and threats of court action.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 people were arrested as riot-gear-clad police rushed
from one protest scene to another in conjunction with the
Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The protests were by-and-large peaceful, mainly centering on
families, with groups of teachers, county employees and others
demonstrating for gay rights and more government help for families,
women and children.
</P>
<P>
   But police quickly responded to a handful of incidents:
</P>
<P>
   -- Forty-five anti-fur protesters, clad all in black with
bandannas covering their faces, were arrested on suspicion of
conspiracy to commit vandalism about 2:30p.m., several found with
firecrackers and other items police termed as weapons.
</P>
<P>
   -- Later Tuesday, about 30 bicyclists were arrested out of a
group of several hundred who rode through city streets supporting
more bike lanes and promoting the environment.
</P>
<P>
   -- Police toyed with a black-clad protest group called the Black
Block, surrounding the group several times in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   -- According to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, some
subway runs were delayed because of protesters standing on the
tracks at above-ground stations.
</P>
<P>
   -- Police closed an intersection around 8:30 p.m. after a crowd
of 75 headed to Parker Center to demand the release of protesters
who were arrested earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Civil libertarians were critical of the afternoon arrests and
the police actions and threatened to go back to federal court to
restrain Los Angeles Police Department officers. But the day after
the melee, police were swarming to meet any potential problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a huge show of police force, and arrests today were
questionable,'' said Marlene Furth, observer for the National
Lawyers Guild. ``But other than that, there was generally
restraint.''
</P>
<P>
   She said officers were hiding their badge numbers and names,
against LAPD policy, ``but the fact that so many people have video
recorders is definitely a deterrent to the police. They know
they're being watched.''
</P>
<P>
   In the incident on Olive Street, police and witnesses said the
protesters pounded on the doors of Edward Borovay Furs, chanted
death threats to workers inside and destroyed a sign.
</P>
<P>
   But Sally Roeker, an office worker who witnessed the arrests,
said the group ``didn't seem to be doing anything wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of officers and cars poured into the area and police
detained the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   According to LAPD spokesman Cmdr. David Kalish, many of the
protesters were carrying aerosol cans converted to be ``mini-flame
throwers,'' containers with fuses, fireworks and flares altered to
be weapons, flammable liquids and sling shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not sure I would characterize this group as protesters,''
he said, but he declined to comment on how he would characterize
them.
</P>
<P>
   Kalish said police learned that the group, which one officer
called ``anarchist,'' planned to march to McDonald's and commit
vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   They were stopped after allegedly destroying a sign on Olive.
</P>
<P>
   Police slowly cataloged all the protesters' possessions,
photographed them and led them aboard three waiting buses.
</P>
<P>
   There were 15 juveniles and 30 adults arrested. There were no
injuries reported and only minimal damage, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what happens when you stand up for what you believe
in,'' one protester yelled from the bus, trying to flash a peace
sign while cuffed. ``We were doing nothing wrong but walking down
the sidewalk.''
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Kerns, 17, was among those arrested. The Calabasas teen
said he's a spokesman for the Animal Defense League. Wearing a
shirt that read Vegan Militia, Kerns said, ``We are peaceful
demonstrators. We are protesting the use of animals for fur
coats.''
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, about 200 bicyclists streamed through downtown
on a Critical Mass bike ride, to show there is an alternative to
cars even in congested downtown L.A.
</P>
<P>
   The cyclists rode for about 45 minutes with a police escort of
about 80 officers on bicycles and dozens more in police cars.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said when the riders went under a freeway overpass,
officers cut them off and that motorcycles sideswiped riders and
officers on foot hit cyclists with batons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were trapping people in alleys and under freeways, all
the dark places,'' said a Los Angeles woman who only gave her first
name as Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   Kit Reilly of Santa Cruz, a veteran Critical Mass rider, said he
never had any trouble on any ride before.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got off their bikes holding their clubs and told us to
get off our bikes,'' Reilly said. ``But they never gave us any
reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Police would not immediately comment on whether the riders were
being arrested and, if so, what they were being arrested for. Those
detained had their bikes impounded.
</P>
<P>
   A bike rider yelled that she was being arrested for ``reckless
driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Other protests went smoothly, all under the watchful eye of
hundreds of police officers.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 protesters in the ``queers and allies march''
traveled from Pershing Square to the Federal Building and back
without incident.
</P>
<P>
   They chanted, ``What do we want? Gay rights.''
</P>
<P>
   They lay in the intersection of Temple Avenue and Los Angeles
Street and outlined their figures in a ``die-in'' representing
death resulting from brutality against homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to express our demands for gay rights,'' said Ray
Fernandez, a participant. ``They have no reason to use violence. We
are peaceful.''
</P>
<P>
   Other activists stayed in and around Pershing Square, the center
of activity.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Campbell, a 36-year-old member of the Peace and Freedom
Party, rode from San Francisco on his BMW motorcycle to join the
protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Protests are good for the media to let people know what the
issues are and who the players are,'' he said. ``But after the
convention's over, you've got to hook up, get in one of these
organizations and get into the long-term day-to-day issues.''

<P>
   DEM-LOBBYISTS-NYT _ Democratic lobbyists are carefully hedging
their bets. While they flaunt their connections to Gore and the

Philadelphia. Lobbying firms have become much more careful in
recent years to cultivate influence in both parties. By Don Van
Natta Jr.

<P>
   DEM-VOICES-NYT (Lombard, Ill.) _ The dedicated Democrats in the
convention hall in Los Angeles were not the only people who might
have grown a bit wistful as they listened to President Clinton on
Monday night. In the living rooms of Chicago's western suburbs,
even independent voters said the speech made them a bit nostalgic.
By Dirk Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   DEM-CONGRESS-NYT _ There have been more senators,
representatives and congressional candidates speaking at the
Democratic National Convention than can be found on the floor of
either house most of the time. With the convention half over, 40
present and perhaps future lawmakers have spoken about everything
from campaign finance legislation to the environment to the minimum
wage to health insurance _ tracking the issues Vice President Al
Gore wants to campaign on. By Adam Clymer.
</P>
<P>
   DEM-MEDIA-NYT _ The first night of the Democratic Convention got
more minutes on network television and pulled in more viewers, both
on the networks and on the cable news channels, than did the first

   KIPP-EDUC (Undated) _ Successful schools for the poor have long
been written off as desert flowers dependent on charismatic leaders
or particular ideology. But Kipp Academy, a pair of extremely
successful middle schools in poor areas of Harlem and Houston, is
something different. Started by two Ivy League idealists and
honored by groups on both the left and right, Kipp is seen as a
model for replication. And now the owners of The Gap have donated
$15 million to create Kipp clones around the country. The process
is starting with a unprecedented year-long training period for the
principals. By Jodi Wilgoren.

   CEO-TENURE (Undated) _ The evidence seems compelling that chief
executives at America's largest companies don't last as long on the
job as they used to. The stock market is far more volatile than it
used to be, management experts say, and directors punish poor
results swiftly. But what everybody believes about the careers of
chief executives, at least at the nation's largest companies, is
probably wrong. A new study has put a kink in the widely held
conventional wisdom. By David Leonhardt.

   LASKAWAY-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ The chairman of Ernst &AMP; Young,
a major accounting firm that has been supportive of the Securities
and Exchange Commission effort to tighten rules on auditor
independence, said Tuesday that the SEC's rule proposal goes too
far and would create too much uncertainty about what activities
were permitted. By Floyd Norris.
</P>
<P>
   RATINGS-AD-COLUMN (Undated) _ They are everywhere, cluttering
the radio dial and the broadcast and cable television channels as
never before: commercials, lots of them, jammed by eager
advertisers into what seems to be every available second of
programming time. So is anyone actually paying attention? By
Bernard Stamler.
</P>
<P>
   EXEC-TURNOVER (Undated) _ The widely publicized ousters of
leaders like Durk I. Jager of Procter &AMP; Gamble, M. Douglas Ivester
of Coca-Cola and Jill E. Barad of Mattel suggest that chief
executives have less staying power than they did just a few years
ago. The reasons seem clear: The stock market is far more volatile
than it used to be, management experts say, and directors punish
poor results swiftly. But a new study concludes that not much has
actually changed at the helm of the nation's biggest companies in
the second half of the 1990s. The median tenure of leaders at 65
large companies was the same at the beginning of 2000 _ six years _
as it had been at the start of 1995. The average term actually rose
one year, to 8.3 years. The results of the study have left
corporate governance experts admittedly puzzled. By David
Leonhardt.

   LONDON-KINETIC-SCULPTURE (London) _ The British art scene is so
heady with hype, gimmickry and self-promotion these days that it

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Battling stormy seas and time, Russian seamen failed
twice to hook up a rescue capsule to the nuclear-powered submarine
lying broken and powerless on the floor of the Barents Sea with 116
men aboard, officials said early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   With little visibility, the attempts, on Tuesday and early
Wednesday, were unable to dock with the submarine. A third attempt
was launched at 8 a.m. on Wednesday. But with high seas and strong
underwater currents, and with the submarine lying at an angle at a
depth of 350 to 480 feet, the chances for a rescue seemed to grow
dimmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we know is that there are still people alive and they are
signaling SOS,'' said the Russian navy's commander, Adm. Vladimir
Kuroyedov. ``Every day the chances are slimmer.''
</P>
<P>
   The only communication with the submarine, the Kursk, was from
inside, from crew members tapping on the hull, Russian officials
said. There were reports that the tapping had grown fainter and
less frequent.
</P>
<P>
   During much of Tuesday, rescue efforts were hampered by winds
that reached 45 miles an hour and whipped up waves of 13 feet.
Water temperatures near the submarine hovered at 39 degrees.
Visibility under water was extremely low, as little as five feet,
the navy said.
</P>
<P>
   But the winds quieted in the night, enabling another rescue
attempt. At least two small bell-shaped rescue capsules, each able
to hold 10 to 20 people, were lowered to the scene of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The capsules are equipped with video cameras and powerful
searchlights and are normally run by three or four people,
according to the RIA news agency. The agency said docking with the
submarine required a high degree of precision.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they succeed in docking, the rescuers would probably
have to carry out exhausted and injured crewmen. Some reports said
that raising the rescue capsule, a simple chamber that hangs from a
ship, could take several hours to avoid potentially fatal
complications from decompression.
</P>
<P>
   The Interfax news agency quoted Kuroyedov as saying that if this
plan failed, the navy might try to raise the 14,000-ton submarine
with 400-ton inflatable pontoons.
</P>
<P>
   Western experts doubted that this could work, given the depth
and the enormous weight of the Kursk and the water that has entered
parts of the submarine. The experts also fear it might take too
long to attach pontoons to the submarine, given what is thought to
be the perilous state of the men inside.
</P>
<P>
   Though information about what happened remained fragmentary and
often contradictory, the Kursk was apparently damaged by an
explosion and partly flooded on Saturday during training maneuvers
of Russia's Northern Fleet. Some earlier reports said the accident
occurred on Sunday, but it now appears that the crew has been in
trouble since Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk is one of Russia's newest and most modern submarines,
and the navy press office said that several high-ranking naval
officers were on board to monitor the exercise along with the
regular crew.
</P>
<P>
   After examining the outside of the submarine, navy officials
said the most likely reason for the accident was an explosion,
possibly from a torpedo carried in the front of the vessel. Russian
officials insisted that there were no nuclear weapons on board and
that the submarine's reactors were shut down. Russia has been
accused of contaminating the Barents with radiation from discarded
nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two Russian vessels were reported in the region
struggling to find ways of saving their comrades.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that oxygen supplies were likely to last only
till Friday and that they had not succeeded in attaching oxygen and
fuel lines to the Kursk. They said that the only power on the
submarine was a battery, which cannot be recharged underwater,
condemning the men to a slow death of asphyxiation if they were not
rescued.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that there was no information about the plight of the
seamen and officers. Submarine experts could only speculate why the
crew was not able to release an antenna, or how much of the vessel
was flooded, or what exactly went so terribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Senior American officials in Washington said two American
submarines had been monitoring the Russian exercise, which began
last Thursday and involved a variety of vessels and aircraft, with
test firings of missiles. The officials said it was one of the
largest exercises held by the Russians in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The American submarines detected a large explosion at about 7:30
or 8 on Saturday morning, the officials said, apparently from the
Kursk. The source was not clear, but the sound was not that of a
collision, they said. American officials ruled out any collision
with an American submarine.
</P>
<P>
   The officials were skeptical of a rescue, noting that the Kursk
was resting at a 60 degree angle, making it unlikely that a rescue
craft could successfully dock.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Although American and other NATO navies offered to help, Russia
initially refused the offers, and in any case it was not
immediately clear what they could do.
</P>
<P>
   A group of Russian military officers met at NATO headquarters in
Brussels, Belgium, on Tuesday night to see if there was anything
the Western alliance could provide. A NATO official said the
Russians discussed technical details in a telephone conference with
naval experts in Northwood, England, where NATO has its naval
headquarters for the eastern Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate indication whether the discussions led to
any concrete action. The British and American navies have various
underwater rescue craft, and Norway and Germany have extensive
undersea oil exploring experience, but it was not clear whether any
Western vessel could link up to the Kursk's hatches.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen sent a letter to the Russian
defense minister, Igor Sergeyev, offering ``any assistance you
need.'' There was no immediate response.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Craig R. Quigley, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy, said
the Navy had informed other countries in the past of the dimensions
of escape hatches that would be compatible with American rescue
capsules. But he did not know whether the Russians had adopted
those standards.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Quigley said the 60-degree list of the Kursk put it
``beyond the design parameters of the U.S. deep submergence rescue
vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlisle A.H. Trost, a retired admiral who was formerly chief of
naval operations, said that even if the Kursk had a fully charged
battery when it went down, the power would probably last only two
or three days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere must be fouling very rapidly,'' said Trost, who
once commanded a nuclear-powered submarine. And ``lights last only
a very limited time.''
</P>
<P>
   The plight of the trapped seamen dominated Russian news. On one
radio call-in show, a former professor demanded to know what could
be done to persuade the authorities to seek outside help: ``What
signs to we need to draw, to whom must we appeal to get them to
accept help?''
</P>
<P>
   At least six seamen from the southeastern Russian city of Kursk,
for which the submarine was named, were on board. One, Dima
Staroseltsev, 20, had finished a training course in June and wrote
home to say he was happy to be leaving for sea, his mother said by
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``His last letter was so joyful,'' the mother, Valentina
Staroseltseva, said. ``He said, mama, there's a great crew on board
here, a bunch of guys from Kursk. We're like one big family.''
</P>
<P>
   The submarine's commander, Gennadi Lyachin, 45, has served in
the Northern Fleet since 1978, according to Russian news reports.
The navy refused to give any details about the rest of the crew.
</P>
<P>
   The crew's plight horrified Russians. ``They are sitting and
waiting,'' said Aleksandr Nikitin, an environmental activist who
once was an engineer on a nuclear submarine. ``This accident
sketches a pretty accurate picture of the state of the navy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of concrete information, experts said it was not
possible to say how long the men could go on. They could slowly run
out of oxygen, succumbing to mental dullness and possibly
convulsions before sinking into a comas and dying.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a buildup of carbon dioxide, the brain would
gradually stop functioning, the men would slip into unconsciousness
and their hearts would weaken and stop. Or, if the electrical
system had failed, they could freeze to death. Or they could perish
from a lethal buildup of nitrogen, sulfides and toxic gases.

   Hall displays old form with 50 freestyle mark
</P>
<P>
   By DANNY ROBBINS
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ From the moment he hits the pool deck, Gary Hall
Jr. sets off sparks.
</P>
<P>
   He wears Apollo Creed-style boxer shorts over his swimsuit. He
flexes his muscles when his name is announced. In the white-bread
world of swimming, he does not compute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten a lot of criticism for what I do,'' he said
Tuesday following another such performance, ``but it's something I
enjoy doing. It's a feeling few people get _ the adrenaline rush of
competing in front of a big crowd. I'm just living in the moment
and enjoying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Once counted out of swimming's elite, Hall's time arrived again
at this year's U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials, punctuated by
Tuesday's American record-breaking effort in the 50-meter
freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Hall won the event in 21.76 seconds, putting him under the 21.81
recorded by Tom Jager 10 years ago and closer to Alexander Popov's
world record of 21.64. Hall's time is the fastest ever recorded in
a field of eight, according to USA Swimming officials, because
Jager's record occurred in a ``Dash for Cash'' exhibition, and
Popov's mark, set in June, came during time trials.
</P>
<P>
   For Hall, the record has special meaning because it represents
an upbeat end to a rocky two years, including a three-month
suspension for testing positive for marijuana and the realization
in March 1999 that he suffers from diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a saying, `What doesn't kill you makes you
stronger,''' he said. ``So maybe I'm stronger. And maybe because of
that, I broke this record.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall's performance was the highlight of an evening that included
a victory in the men's 100-meter butterfly by 17-year-old Ian
Crocker of Portland, Maine, the eighth teenager to qualify for the
U.S. men's team. Crocker, due to be a freshman at the University of
Texas this year, set a trials record and finished ahead of a future
teammate, UT sophomore Tommy Hannon.
</P>
<P>
   Considering he comes from Maine, a state that does not have a
50-meter pool, Crocker is one of the more unlikely members of the
2000 Olympic team. His club, Portland Porpoise, trains in a series
of 25-meter pools in the Portland area and travels to Dover, N.H.,
to use a 50-meter pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have nice facilities,'' said Sharon Power,
Crocker's coach, ``but obviously, they're not that essential.''
</P>
<P>
   In winning the 50, Hall touched ahead of University of
California sophomore Anthony Ervin, who recorded a 21.80. Former
Texas swimmer Neil Walker was third in 22.12.
</P>
<P>
   Hall and Ervin train together in Phoenix as part of a
multi-national group of swimmers known as ``World Team 2000.''
Coached by ex-Olympian Mike Bottom, the group is unique in that it
is geared for one type of swimmer _ sprinters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're able to push each other,'' Ervin said, ``and that makes
us that much better.''
</P>
<P>
   They are also doing some unconventional things. According to
Bottom, the group is eating protein ``horse bars'' similar to those
fed to Kentucky Derby champion Fusaichi Pegasus.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, runner-up to Walker in the 100 freestyle, said breaking
Jager's American record was something to celebrate because it had
stood for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a record that, up until not too long ago, was almost
unattainable,'' he said. ``To pass that is really exciting. But now
there's a new fixture that Alex (Popov) has set, and that's next.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall burst into the public consciousness four years ago in
Atlanta, where, at 21, he finished second to Popov in both the 50
and 100. He was one of the marquee names on the 1996 U.S. team, son
of three-time Olympian Gary Hall Sr., and expectations were high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm resentful about that whole talent thing,'' he said when
asked about the pressure of measuring up. ``People expect me to be
a great swimmer because my father was a great swimmer. I've just
been working hard, just like everybody else who's qualified for the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   With his future clouded by his diabetes _ he controls the
disease with daily insulin injections and glucose monitoring _ Hall
entered this Olympic year as something of a curioisity. But in the
end, he made it back, in position to battle Popov again.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about facing the Russian in Sydney, Hall smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can expect a great race,'' he said, letting the answer end
there.

   Astros buck trend with close call
</P>
<P>
   By CARLTON THOMPSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   To watch the late-inning finagling, pitching changes and pinch
hitters, you hardly would have known this was a game between two of
the worst teams in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the Astros' good years, manager Larry Dierker often said
his Pittsburgh Pirates counterpart, Gene Lamont, provided one of
his biggest challenges, and Tuesday was no different.
</P>
<P>
   But when the scribbling on the lineup cards finally was done, it
was Dierker and the Astros who came out on top in a 5-4 victory
before the smallest crowd (30,020) to watch a game at Enron Field.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Lima won for the first time this month, and Octavio Dotel
worked the final 1 innings for his sixth save, tying Billy Wagner
for the team lead. Dotel struck out Jason Kendall on a contested
called third strike to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were close,'' said Dotel, referring to his final two
pitches _ the first of which was called a ball. ``(The umpire)
didn't give me the first one, but I put the next one in the right
spot and got the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kendall is a pretty good hitter. I was trying to stay away
from him. If you leave a pitch inside, you're going to be in
trouble. I didn't care if I (walked) him with two out. I just
didn't want to give in to a good hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall, who started toward first base as if he had drawn a
walk, had words with home plate umpire Jerry Meals and had to be
restrained as players from both teams were leaving the field.
</P>
<P>
   The one-run victory was rare for the Astros, who have won just
seven of their 31 games decided by the slimmest of margins. The
Astros have won three in a row and six of their last 10, and they
are 17-16 since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to have some fun and finish it off strong,''
Astros left fielder Daryle Ward said. ``We've played better during
the second half. I wish there was a championship for each half of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have to step it up. We don't want to lose 100 games.
To think that could happen is scary. Our attitude has been
different in the second half. We had this attitude earlier in the
season, but we didn't hold on to it. If we would have held on to
it, things might have been better.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we started losing, and we started making excuses about the
ballpark and this and that. Now that we're winning, there are no
excuses. We're just having fun playing baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros need to win 16 of their remaining 42 games to avoid
losing 100 games for the first time in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best sign that things might be turning around for
them is the fact Chris Holt and Lima (a combined 10-26) won in
back-to-back games for the first time this season, although they
received decisions on consecutive nights on seven previous
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Lima (5-14), who always is looking for an edge, shaved his blond
hair, which he has worn proudly for almost two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that will be a good thing,'' Lima said. ``It was
starting to feel weird. And hot, too. But today I felt handsome and
good-looking.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates lost for the third consecutive game and for the
eighth time in their last 10 games. Wasted in the effort was Brian
Giles' bid for the cycle. He hit a homer in the first, a triple in
the third, and a double in the fifth. His final plate appearance
came in the eighth inning when he was hit by a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Pirates starter Kris Benson (8-10) took the loss, allowing four
runs on six hits and five walks in 6 innings.
</P>
<P>
   After getting pounded from the start in Monday's 14-run loss,
the Pirates appeared ready to turn the tables when they bombed Lima
for two solo homers in the first inning. Leadoff hitter Adrian
Brown and Giles did the honors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lima was dodging bullets the whole time he was out there,''
Dierker said. ``I took him out after six innings, and he probably
could have gone more, but I just thought it was time to make a
change. It was more about the pitches he threw rather than the
number of pitches (102) he threw.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima has allowed a club-record 38 homers _ most in the majors
this season. At his current pace, Lima will allow 51 homers this
season, which would break the major-league record of 50 set by
Minnesota's Bert Blyleven in 1986. The National League record is
46, served up by Philadelphia's Robin Roberts in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell and Ward gave Lima new life in the bottom of the
inning with a pair of solo homers of their own. Bagwell, who has 34
homers, extended his hitting streak to 14 games. Ward's homer was
his second in a span of three at-bats and his 18th of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Lima's fielder's-choice grounder scored Tony Eusebio from third,
breaking the tie in the second inning. But Giles' two-out triple
tied the score at 3 in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Julio Lugo's two-out ground-rule double broke the tie in the
fourth inning, and Lima held the Pirates scoreless in his final
three innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros padded their lead in the eighth on Chris Truby's
sixth home run, a solo shot into the Crawford Boxes. Pat Meares'
solo homer off the railroad tracks in left field gave the Pirates
hope in the ninth, and the visitors had the potential tying run at
second base when the game ended.

   Only Comets' title chase unites Swoopes, Cooper
</P>
<P>
   By JOSH GAJEWSKI
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   At halftime of Monday night's game against Sacramento, as the
rest of the Comets made final preparations for the second half,
there was Cynthia Cooper _ out on the floor, sitting on the bench
with a frustrated demeanor and a look of disgust.
</P>
<P>
   For the two-time WNBA Most Valuable Player, it was a sign of the
times. The Comets were winning as usual, but Cooper had contributed
only five points (on 1-of-5 shooting), while teammate Sheryl
Swoopes led the way with 18 to go along with three steals.
</P>
<P>
   It is, after all, Swoopes who has been stealing all the glory as
of late _ being named WNBA Defensive Player of the Year on Tuesday,
with an MVP announcement expected to follow soon. And on Tuesday,
both players openly acknowledged what everyone has known all along
_ that their relationship falls way short of being harmonious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Cynthia and I might have our differences on the
court,'' Swoopes said in the closing moments of her news
conference. ``But for four years now, I've been very honored to
play with such a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's very nice,'' Cooper said in response. ``People
say that we've had issues and other problems and all these
different things, (but) while we might not go out to dinner, we
have won three championships together. So I think we've shown that
we can be professionals and come out here and play the game _ the
game we both love and both respect.''
</P>
<P>
   But they certainly don't love each other.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper hasn't changed her plan to retire after the season, and
the look on her face at halftime Monday only signified the
bitterness she continues to feel about her diminished role on the
team. This is Swoopes' club now, not Cooper's. And while the two
continue to successfully coexist on the court, their relationship
off it is a bit of a different story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm paid to play basketball,'' Cooper said. ``I'm not paid to
have best friends. I didn't know Sheryl before the WNBA, and Sheryl
didn't know me before the WNBA. So what? Are you guys trying to say
we're supposed to be best friends?''
</P>
<P>
   Said guard Coquese Washington: ``To me, it's obvious that
sometimes when they play, they might not like what's going on out
on the court, but they play to win. They're willing to do whatever
it takes to get a fourth ring, and that attitude permeates
throughout the entire team. You don't always have to like the
person you're working with.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly seems as though Swoopes and Cooper don't. Never
have, and probably never will.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Van Chancellor doesn't see the matter as having any great
bearing on the season's outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody asks me (about the two), and I don't see it as a
challenge whatsoever because when they have a basketball, they make
plays,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out at Sacramento, I thought about running a play that we'd
been scoring on every time. I was going to switch off because I
thought Sacramento was ready to defend that play, and the first
thing Sheryl said was, `Hey, coach, don't switch off on that play.
We've got to get Cynthia the ball.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's natural to want the basketball. They both want to
win, so when it comes to winning time, they're going to put
everything else aside and do what is necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a column written about everything, every day, about
things we don't necessarily know about, understand, or agree
with,'' she said. ``So I don't understand why it's such a big deal,
especially when we've been successful here in the arena of women's
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should be the center focus of any conversation between
Sheryl and myself. It should be, `You know, those two names helped
bring three championships to Houston.' And not anything negative.''

ON-THE-SPOT LARRIMORE PASSES TEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ The player who was under the most
scrutiny Sunday night against the Oakland Raiders made the biggest
impression, Dallas Cowboys coach Dave Campo said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With Kevin Smith expected to announce his retirement within the
next week, rookie cornerback Kareem Larrimore has moved into the
starting role at left cornerback, becoming the man on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Campo liked the way Larrimore responded in the game, citing his
go-getter attitude along with his six tackles and pass deflection.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made the biggest jump in the game,'' Campo said. ``He was
one of the guys that stood out. He wanted to be out there. He was
really into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo, however, said one game doesn't make him a starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want him to get the feeling that it is a secure
situation,'' Campo said. ``We still have Charlie (Williams). We
still have Duane Hawthorne. We still have Mario Edwards. There are
still guys who can play that position.''
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuous by his absence on Campo's list of cornerback
possibilities was the player they tabbed on draft day as the heir
apparent to the position, 2000 top draft pick Dwayne Goodrich, who
has been unimpressive so far. Goodrich is sidelined with a strained
hamstring. GUT FEELING POINTS TO SEDER
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys said Tuesday that the statistical battle between
kickers Tim Seder and Rian Lindell was close.
</P>
<P>
   Lindell, who was released Monday, was perfect on three attempts.
Seder was 3-of-4, with his only miss coming on a 58-yard try in the
waning moments of Sunday's 21-20 loss to the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Campo said the decision came down to ``a gut feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very poised and he handles pressure well,'' Campo said
of Seder.
</P>
<P>
   Campo, however, stressed that while the Seder is now the lone
kicker on the roster, he still must prove that he deserves to be
the team's opening-day kicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kicking business is a day-to-day scenario,'' Campo said.
``He knows he will be under scrutiny. This gives him two games to
be prepared for the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Seder, a former high school teacher who is trying to live out a
childhood dream, knows he has a long way to go before Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to continue to work,'' Seder said. ``I can't
let up.'' BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ The Cowboys waived former TCU linebacker Joe Phipps, who had
been sidelined the past three weeks with a sprained left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fullback Robert Thomas has a grade one knee sprain. He is
listed as day to day, however it's doubtful that Thomas will be
ready for Saturday's game against the Denver Broncos. In his
absence, the Cowboys will use a lot of two-tight-end sets with
H-back Jackie Harris filling Thomas' fullback role. Ryan Neufeld
will sub for him as a conventional fullback.
</P>
<P>
   _ Running back Emmitt Smith (strained calf) and tight end David
LaFleur (strained groin) could return to practice this week.
However, they might be held out of Saturday's game for
precautionary reasons. Campo said the Cowboys are going to bring
Smith and LaFleur back slowly, because the main focus is for them
to be ready for the Sept. 3 season opener.
</P>
<P>
   _ Guard Larry Allen (fractured hand) guard/tackle Tony Hutson
(knee surgery) and safety Izell Reese (neck surgery) are all
expected to see their first action of the preseason against the
Broncos. All three have been limited in their work in training camp
because of injuries and/or rehab.
</P>
<P>
   _ Defensive end Greg Ellis (leg fracture) and receiver Jason
Tucker (strained groin/toe surgery) won't play against the Broncos,
but are expected to see time in the Cowboys' final preseason game
Aug. 24 against the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dave Campo said the starters will probably play the entire
first half against Broncos, though quarterback Troy Aikman might
split time with Randall Cunningham with the first unit. nn

KAPLER EXTENDS STREAK TO 28 AS RANGERS CONTINUE SKID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Streak is alive and well. Gabe Kapler
singled in the eighth inning Tuesday night, extending his hitting
streak to 28 games.
</P>
<P>
   As for Kapler's team, it remains dead and buried.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers fell to the New York Yankees, 10-2, at The
Ballpark in Arlington, losing for the ninth time in the past 12
games. They dropped to 54-63, nine games under .500 for the first
time since Sept. 27, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   As it has been all too often lately, Kapler's hit was the lone
bright spot.
</P>
<P>
   He went hitless in his first three at-bats, hitting two routine
fly balls to right field and one to left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel too good at the plate,'' he said. ``For the
first time in a long time, I felt a little nervous. I don't know
why, but I had some nervous energy.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he came up in the eighth, he was able to bounce a
two-hopper up the middle and into center field off Yankees reliever
Dwight Gooden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I slowed it down on the last at-bat and saw the ball a little
better,'' Kapler said.
</P>
<P>
   While the hit sent the remnants of the crowd home happy, the
Rangers were hoping for a little more. Such as improvement from
starting pitcher Doug Davis, one of the youngsters the club is
hoping can develop enough this season to be a part of their plans
for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Davis allowed seven runs on 10 hits in 22/3 innings,
including two home runs. One was a tape-measure shot by David
Justice in the first inning. Justice smashed a Davis slider 443
feet into the upper deck of the home run porch, the longest ball
hit to right in the history of The Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a little tired and started getting the ball up, and they
just crushed it,'' Davis said. ``They make you pay when you get the
ball up.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis has pitched decently as a reliever, going 3-1 with a 4.56
earned-run average. But as a starter, he has been pounded to the
tune of a 1-3 record and 11.69 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at his numbers as a starter and out of the bullpen,
and we've got to find the difference,'' manager Johnny Oates said.
``That's a good lineup, but to be successful in the big leagues
you've got to beat good lineups. He just hasn't got the job done as
a starter.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, 4-4 with an 8.02 ERA, was 8-3 with a 2.84 ERA in 12
starts at Triple-A Oklahoma before joining the Rangers. This was
his first start since Aug. 5, and he said he has struggled since
shuttling between the rotation and bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just need to get into a rhythm,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, he's disappointed he hasn't done better,
not just for this season but for the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it as an opportunity for me to win a job in the
rotation for next year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the trio of young starting pitchers have shown enough to
make the Rangers sign them into their plans for next season.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Glynn has been the best of the trio; he's 3-2 with a 4.70
ERA. But the Rangers have to be concerned about his health. He was
placed on the disabled list Tuesday to give doctors time to find
out the cause of his mysterious fainting spell in the dugout Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Perisho showed flashes of his ability when he struck out
eight Yankees in six innings, but he also gave up six runs. He's
2-5 with a 6.33 ERA and hasn't won since June 17.
</P>
<P>
   And Davis had the bad outing Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Helling and Kenny Rogers are entrenched at the top of the
rotation for next season. If the club signs a free agent or trades
for another pitcher, it still would need to fill the last two
spots.
</P>
<P>
   Either Darren Oliver and Justin Thompson must get healthy, or
Davis, Glynn and/or Perisho must improve.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent results, Oates hasn't given up on the latter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have patience,'' he said. ``You're going to have
growing pains. We were supposed to have Darren Oliver, Mark Clark
and Justin Thompson. These guys were thrown into the fray, and here
they are facing the world champions. I think it's good for them.
Hopefully, they'll learn from it and it will make them better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers hope so. Chances are, Kapler won't have a hitting
streak to keep the paying customers happy next season. nn

EVERYBODY SAY `TOLD YOU SO,' THEN CONSIDER THE POSITIVE SPIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ The ``told-you-so'' echo became a
tiresome item here Tuesday as the Dallas Cowboys began their final
week of the training camp grind.
</P>
<P>
   Erik Williams, ending his retirement-holdout-vacation-whatever,
said his first hello of the summer to the campus of Midwestern
State University, just as the rest of the team was preparing to
give the place a goodbye kiss-off.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' timing was, well, both perfect and intentional. Yes,
everybody correctly saw it coming a month ago. Everybody knew he
was ducking the heat, ducking dorm life, and ducking Tokyo.
Everybody turned out to be right. All together now. Told you so.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Williams' absence showed a total disregard for the
team concept, and in some ways, displayed a lack of respect for new
head coach Dave Campo, who since January has preached a return to
football-related family values at Valley Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   But before the first whistle of the summer in Wichita Falls, the
veteran offensive tackle with the three Super Bowl rings (only
seven of that group remains), decided to shun whatever leadership
responsibility Campo wanted to give him, and sit it out back home.
</P>
<P>
   Let others bust butts, guts and bones while wilting in the blast
furnace. Williams was above all that. After nine years, you'd
figure something would sink in. Then again, after nine years, you'd
also figure Williams would have learned the snap count. Why expect
miracles?
</P>
<P>
   Surely, there will be a hefty fine imposed by Jerry Jones or
Campo. You'd think, huh? But a fine won't happen, because for
public consumption both Jones and Campo say they believe Williams'
alibi that he was thinking about retirement. (If that's true, both
Jerry and Dave should also volunteer to help O.J. find the real
killer.)
</P>
<P>
   Then, surely his teammates are livid with Williams for taking
the easy way out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never personally hold it against him,'' said center
Mark Stepnoski, an 11-year vet with a well-known dislike for
everything associated with training camp. ``I'm just glad Erik is
here now.''
</P>
<P>
   But if every vet shared his attitude, training camp would be for
rookies only. ``That's true,'' shrugged Stepnoski, ``but I don't
know what else to say on that. My thinking is if Erik hadn't shown
up, we'd be wishing he had. The only thing I hope is he stayed in
shape. If he did, he'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   And here's where the Williams' saga takes a different spin. A
much more positive spin. Picking up where Stepnoski left off with
that last comment, if Williams did work out regularly while he was
sitting out, then he could well be the team's best player the first
month of the regular season. Seriously.
</P>
<P>
   It's all about having a fresh body and fresh mind, which, of
course, is the ongoing indictment of how long NFL training camps
carry on before the season actually begins.
</P>
<P>
   Hark back to the words of just-retired Daryl Johnston as the
Cowboys were beginning this camp without him:
</P>
<P>
   ``The best physical condition you will be in all season is on
the first day of training camp. The worst physical condition you
will be in all season is on the last day of training camp. You
spend the first month of the regular season trying to get your body
back to where it was when training camp opened.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepnoski couldn't agree more. ``I had a contract holdout one
summer, and another summer I didn't get on the field because I was
rehabbing my knee,'' he said. ``Both of those seasons turned out to
be the best I've ever felt. Physically, Eric is going to be very
refreshed. Mentally, he will have to get himself right, but that
shouldn't be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The Deion-like message here is that the more training camp a
veteran misses _ valid excuse or not _ the better a season he is
likely to have. How out of whack is that?
</P>
<P>
   There's also no question that having Williams back at right
tackle puts the offensive line at optimum strength. But that's just
for now. In his absence, positive things started to develop as a
youngster, Solomon Page, took over at right tackle and others had
to fill in for Page at right guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only can Solomon handle it at tackle, his future there is
very, very bright based on what we've been seeing,'' line coach
Hudson Houck said.
</P>
<P>
   Message to Erik Williams:
</P>
<P>
   While you were laid out under the air conditioning back home,
your replacement for next season was found.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, a surprise at guard also developed in the form of Kelvin
Garmon, the Baylor and Haltom High product. ``With Erik not here,
we had to shuffle at guard when Solomon moved over,'' Houck said.
``What we found with Garmon pleases us all.''
</P>
<P>
   So while Williams' arrival brought out the ``told-you-so'' army
Tuesday, there were also other stories to tell.

HOGAN MADE MAJOR RECOVER IN MAGICAL '53 SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAN PILLER 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Tiger Woods tees off at the PGA Championship in Louisville,
Ky., Thursday, he will confront not only the best professional
golfers in the world but also the mystical weight of Ben Hogan's
47-year-old feat of winning three major golf championships in a
single season.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1953 no golfer _ a group that includes Arnold Palmer, Jack
Nicklaus, Lee Trevino, Tom Watson, Gary Player, Nick Faldo and Mark
O'Meara _ has been able to advance beyond two majors in a season.
</P>
<P>
   With victories at the U.S. and British Opens in hand, Woods is
positioned to stride alongside longtime Fort Worth resident Hogan,
who died three years ago last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hogan was already known as America's best golfer in 1953,''
says retired broadcaster John Derr, who covered Hogan in 1953.
``But those three majors made him a legend.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan's 1953 season concluded a remarkable period beginning in
1948 when he won the U.S. Open and PGA tournaments and was the
leading money-winner on the tour. He then lost almost all of the
1949 season when the car he was driving was hit head-on by a bus
near Van Horn in West Texas. He dramatically came back from that
setback in 1950, winning the U.S. Open. He won his first Masters in
1951 and repeated as U.S. Open champ, all while moviegoers were
watching an idealized version of the comeback story in the movie
``Follow the Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   But in 1952, Hogan's star appeared to dim.
</P>
<P>
   He failed to repeat at the Masters and the U.S. Open when he
faded in the last 36 holes. Noticeably poor putting that summer,
plus his 40th birthday in August 1952, generated speculation that
Hogan's comeback was complete. It appeared he was ready to slide
into the golfing sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Hogan rebounded in 1953 by winning five of the six
tournaments he entered. As was his custom in the post-accident
period, Hogan didn't play in the 1953 PGA, which was held
concurrent with the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan started his 1953 season at the Masters in Georgia, where
he set a tournament record of 274 in a five-shot victory. His 274
stood for a dozen years as the Masters' 72-hole record until
bettered by three shots by Jack Nicklaus. Woods lowered the mark by
a stroke in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the fourth of what would be five Colonial National
Invitation tournaments in his hometown, Hogan journeyed to the '53
U.S. Open at Oakmont in Pennsylvania. Hogan opened with a 69 on the
first day and led all four rounds, finishing at 283 and beating
longtime rival Sam Snead by six shots. His winning margin was the
largest at the Open since 1938.
</P>
<P>
   The blowout wins at Augusta and Oakmont erased memories of
Hogan's frustrating 1952 season. At Augusta, he skied to 79 on the
final day when a simple par-72 would have tied him with the
eventual winner, Snead. At the U.S. Open, conducted at the
Northwood Club in Dallas, Hogan opened with two 69s for a 36-hole
record and a two-stroke lead. But on the 36-hole finale on
Saturday, he wilted in the hot weather with two 74s and finished
third, five shots behind winner Julius Boros.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan's last-day collapses at Augusta and Northwood, combined
with his 40th birthday two months later, generated
Hogan-is-finished speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Close observers, and many of Hogan's fellow pros, noted that
while Hogan still had the best tee-to-green game in golf that the
Texan's putter was suspect. Their observations about Hogan's
putting would have been more pointed had Hogan allowed public
knowledge of his accident-related problem in his left eye.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions of Hogan's putting was aired publicly. In
private, in locker rooms and press tents, the commentary on Hogan
centered on his finances. Hogan was known to have made considerable
money in the new postwar oil boom. He also was known to have
received a generous settlement _ estimated at least in the six
figures _ from the Greyhound Bus Company, whose vehicle had slammed
into Hogan's Cadillac on the morning of Feb. 2, 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan, it was believed, had proved his point with the Open
victories in 1950 and '51. His comeback complete and his finances
secure, Hogan's weak 1952 performance thus revealed in the minds of
many a new lack of competitiveness from the man whose intense
concentration and flinty stare had for years intimidated even the
most hardened professional competitor.
</P>
<P>
   But Hogan's victories at Augusta and Oakmont, combined with
another summer victory at the Pan American Open in Mexico City,
showed that Hogan's drive for victory had not abated. And at the
conclusion of the Oakmont Open, Hogan announced that he would play
in a third major, the upcoming British Open at Carnoustie in
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Many figures influential in Hogan's life, led by wife Valerie
and British Open champions Bobby Jones, Walter Hagen and Tommy
Armour, had urged Hogan to travel to Carnoustie. As Valerie said 46
years later, on the eve of another Carnoustie Open, ``Ben was
getting bored. He needed another challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnoustie offered challenges aplenty, led by the 7,300-yard
course that was considered then and now the toughest of the British
Open venues. The difficulty of the course was compounded by its
condition, particularly the shaggy greens. Hogan also had to adjust
to the smaller ball then in use in Great Britain, a temperamentally
jumpy caddie, strange and sparse food and galleries that were
allowed to roam freely and jostle players.
</P>
<P>
   But Hogan played through those problems, plus rain and a heavy
head cold, to shoot a four-round 282 to win the British Open by
four strokes. His winning score would be eight shots lower than the
290 that Paul Lawrie would shoot on a much better conditioned
Carnoustie course to win the 1999 British Open.
</P>
<P>
   The 1953 season proved to be Hogan's last great year. With the
founding of the Ben Hogan Co. club manufacturing firm in Fort Worth
in October 1953, Hogan now had a full-time job. Tournament golf was
even more of a sidelight. Even so, Hogan remained a competitive
force in the game. He lost playoffs to Sam Snead for the 1954
Masters and Jack Fleck for the 1955 U.S. Open, and was runner-up by
a stroke at the 1956 U.S. Open. As late as the 1960 U.S. Open at
Cherry Hills in Denver, Hogan reached the 71st hole with a share of
the lead with Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus when a wedge shot
fell into a moat in front of the green.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of jet air travel in the 1960s made the British Open
accessible to American golfers, creating the modern Grand Slam of
the Masters, the U.S. and British Opens and the PGA for the single
season.
</P>
<P>
   But beginning with Palmer, the 1960 Masters and U.S. Open
Champion, and continuing through the greatest players since, no
golfer has yet equaled Hogan's 1953 mark of three majors in a
season.

TIGER HAS TURNED THE TALE FOR DAN JENKINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Considering the source, the comments border
on blasphemy. But don't question the tried-and-true, Fort
Worth-loving pedigree of Dan Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   The renowned author and golf writer remains the world's No. 1
supporter of Ben Hogan, the Fort Worth legend who stands as the
only professional golfer to win three major championships in one
season. Hogan turned the trick in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 47 years, his ``Triple Crown'' has withstood
challenges from the likes of Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Tom
Watson. This week, a new gunslinger takes aim at the standard.
Unlike his predecessors, Jenkins senses that Tiger Woods is equal
to the task.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd see a better shot-maker than Hogan or a
better winner than Nicklaus,'' said Jenkins, a Fort Worth native
and TCU graduate who has written about professional golf for six
decades. ``But I have. It's Tiger. My jaw is agape.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins said he reached that conclusion after watching Woods
dominate the competition at the U.S. Open and British Open. Woods,
24, won golf's past two major championships by a combined 23
strokes. The triumphs made him the youngest player in history to
complete a career grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   Next up is the PGA Championship, which begins Thursday at
Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Ky. A victory would give Woods
his third major championship of the season, matching Hogan's mark
from '53.
</P>
<P>
   Because Valhalla is a birdie sanctuary for PGA Tour
participants, it does not narrow the field of contenders in the
same manner as most major-championship venues. That is why Jenkins
said he's not sure if Woods will join Hogan on the short list of
Triple Crown winners this season.
</P>
<P>
   But he's convinced Woods will surpass Hogan some year when he
wins the Masters, the season's first major, and develops a hunger
to become the first professional golfer to win all four majors in
the same year. A grand slam by Woods? Book it, says Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Tiger will do it if he doesn't get hurt,'' Jenkins
said. ``He doesn't have any weaknesses in his game. The only things
that can stop Tiger are an injury or a bad marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins covered the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach Golf Links and the
British Open at the Old Course in St. Andrews, Scotland, this year.
In many ways, Jenkins found himself stunned more by Woods'
eight-stroke victory in Scotland than by his 15-stroke romp in
Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The win at Pebble could've seemed like a fluke,'' Jenkins
said, likening it to Woods' 12-stroke victory at the 1997 Masters,
when no pursuers surfaced during weekend rounds. ``You could say,
`OK, Tiger will have one of these tournaments every three years.'
But what he did at St. Andrews erased all doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Saddled with enormous expectations before the event, Woods
merely shot four consecutive rounds in the 60s and posted the
lowest total in relation to par (19 under) at any major
championship. He hit 200-yard shots from deep rough where
competitors struggled to move the ball 40 feet. At that point,
Jenkins became a convert. He accepted the notion that Woods,
barring catastrophe, will one day surpass Nicklaus and his beloved
Hogan, to be hailed as the greatest golfer the game has known.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins envisions Woods setting standards that will provide him
that status through public acclamation, with little regard given to
who competed in what era, using which type of equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, I put the over-under total for Tiger's major
championships at 12,'' Jenkins said. ``Now, I'd say 25. I'm
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering that Woods has four to his name, 14 fewer than
Nicklaus' record for professional golfers, such a statement seems
outrageous. But don't ask me to volunteer to take the ``under'' and
be forced to live with the financial consequences in 2030, when
Woods might still be winning green jackets at 54.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan, rest assured, will always remain a golf icon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the greatest golfer who ever lived, at the time,'' said
Jenkins, one of the few journalists to witness Hogan, Nicklaus and
Woods at the top of their games.
</P>
<P>
   But times change. So do opinions. Jenkins, in fact, said Hogan
would have identified Woods as the man to beat in head-to-head
duels if they'd competed in the same era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben was so much in awe of length, he would've said, `Tiger
Woods should win every tournament,' '' Jenkins said.
</P>
<P>
   No one, of course, will ever do that. But Woods has come closer
than anyone since Hogan, who won five times in six starts in 1953.
A victory at the PGA would be Woods' 14th title in his past 25
appearances at PGA Tour events, as well as his third consecutive
major championship.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins has long deemed Hogan's 1953 Triple Crown the crowning
achievement by any professional golfer in a calendar year. With a
victory at Valhalla, Jenkins said Woods' 2000 season ``would be
right up there with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Woods, in the long run, appears destined for even bigger
things.
</P>
<P>
   ATTENTION MORE INTENSE ON WOODS THAN IT WAS ON HOGAN
</P>
<P>
   For the second time this season, history has linked Tiger Woods
with Ben Hogan, the golf legend from Fort Worth. And the stakes
keep getting higher.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Woods became the first golfer since Hogan in 1948
to win six consecutive events on the PGA Tour. It marked the
second-longest winning streak in tour history, behind Byron
Nelson's 11 consecutive victories in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   This week at the PGA Championship, Woods has a chance to join
Hogan as the only professional golfers to win three major
championships in one season. Hogan did it in 1953, when his
``Triple Crown'' earned him ticker-tape parades in Fort Worth and
New York City. Those who watched Hogan pull his trifecta said there
was a significant difference in public perception heading into
those events compared with what Woods faces heading into Thursday's
opening round of the PGA.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two months, rivals have openly questioned if anyone
can stop Woods' winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never like that with Hogan,'' said Dan Jenkins,
renowned author and golf writer. ``The other guys were not afraid
of Hogan. They knew he'd be there at the end, but they thought they
could do it, too. Right now, Tiger has nobody pushing him. Hogan
had Sam Snead. That's a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditto for the physiques of the protagonists. Hogan (5-foot-9,
145 pounds) never overpowered courses as does Woods (6-2, 180).
</P>
<P>
   ``Hogan had to strive for everything. He always struggled for
distance, even in his prime,'' Jenkins said. ``Tiger is a great
athlete. Everyone knows he's long off the tee, but what separates
him is that he's long through the bag. He's long with his mid-irons
and short irons, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, Hogan received little public acclaim until after he won
the British Open, the third leg of his Triple Crown. Woods has been
under the media microscope for two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``After he won the British, people all over the world were
talking about Tiger, even if they weren't golf fans,'' said Jerre
Todd, retired publicity director for the Colonial tournament whose
ties to professional golf trace back to the '50s. ``That was not
the case with Hogan. To knowledgeable golf fans, it was a big deal.
To everyone else, it wasn't. It was hard to work up a good
stampede.''
</P>
<P>
   But a publicity stampede will be inevitable if Woods matches
Hogan as a Triple Crown winner. Jenkins considers Woods the PGA
favorite, but not a lock to win. Todd believes Hogan will soon be
joined on one of the shortest lists in the golf history book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll win the PGA,'' Todd said. ``When you talk about
dominating peers, Tiger seems to be a step ahead of Hogan in that
regard. Hogan was invariably the favorite when he played, but the
other guys thought they could beat him. These guys today don't
think they can beat Tiger. And if he wins the PGA, it'll just
cement it in their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   CHIP SHOTS FAMILIAR FRIEND
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth resident Mark Brooks, winner of the 1996 PGA
Championship at Valhalla, said he expects warm memories this week
when he visits the 15th tee. Brooks finished 4 under par in four
visits to the par-4 hole in '96.
</P>
<P>
   During the third round, he holed a 6-iron from 170 yards for an
eagle. In the final round, Brooks' closing charge began with an
8-foot birdie putt at No. 15. Brooks took birdies on three of his
last five holes, including one in the playoff, to beat Kenny Perry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the holes I played that week, that was my hole,''
Brooks said. ``When I got to the tee box in the final round, that
gave me a boost of confidence. I hope I get some more good vibes
this week.'' VOLUNTEERS, GOLFERS NEEDED
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Bank One Senior Classic seek volunteers to work
at the Sept. 22-24 event, and golfers to participate in pro-ams
during tournament week.
</P>
<P>
   Tournament director Tim Erensen said organizers need 100-150
additional volunteers to serve as marshals or perform other duties
during the event at Bent Tree Country Club in Dallas. In addition,
Erensen said 20 pro-am spots remain for rounds on Wednesday or
Thursday of tournament week. Pro-am spots cost $2,500 each.
</P>
<P>
   Those interested in working at the event or playing in the
pro-am should contact Alexa Devine at (972) 661-1256. SPONSORSHIP
UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   Senior PGA Tour officials said Tuesday that they will examine a
sponsorship proposal forwarded by the Dallas Rotary Club and expect
to decide within the next two weeks whether the city will have an
event on the 2001 schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One is dropping its title sponsorship of the Bank One
Senior Championship, scheduled Sept. 22-24 at Bent Tree Country
Club, after this year's tournament. Within the past week, Rotary
Club members have a secured three-year commitment from a potential
replacement sponsor to keep the event in Dallas, said club
president Buck Revell. Tour officials said they will examine the
proposal, but are unsure if an agreement can be reached in time to
land a date on the 2001 calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Tour officials hope to finalize the 2001 by Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   LPGA GOLDEN MOMENTS
</P>
<P>
   ``To commemorate the LPGA Tour's 50th anniversary, the''
Star-Telegram ``will feature a significant moment in tour history
each week during the 2000 season.'' Aug. 30, 1987
</P>
<P>
   Ayako Okamoto of Japan won her fourth tournament of the season
(Nestle World Championship), giving her enough points to become the
first international golfer to win the LPGA Tour's Player of the
Year award. The triumph marked the start of a trend. Foreign-born
players have won the award the past five years, with Australia's
Karrie Webb or Sweden's Annika Sorenstam likely to extend the
streak to six at the conclusion of the 2000 season. nn

 &HT;    'Don't ever let a deer die in your yard'
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Nancy Linares, a grandmother who lives on a
cul-de-sac, has advice regarding allowing critters to croak on your
property.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ever let a deer die in your yard in Austin,'' she said.
Unless you want to spend the day finding somebody to come pick it
up.
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday, the guy who cuts Nancy's yard told her that she
had a dead deer toward the back of her yard. In this heat, she
would have found it herself sooner or later. ``When I came home
Thursday night, I thought it was the worst smell,'' she recalled.
``I thought somebody had put some horrible fertilizer in their yard
or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Another clue? ``There were these huge black birds in the back
yard,'' Nancy said.
</P>
<P>
   So Friday morning Nancy began a string of phone calls in an
effort to get the deer taken away. She called the City of Austin
first. A woman on the line told Nancy to call the city's Utility
Customer Service Center _ and do the old Press 1, Press 2, Press 3
routine. None of which addressed dead deer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There weren't any numbers that had anything about dead
animals, so I punched zero,'' she said. Zero was what she got. She
ended up on hold for 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Switching gears, Nancy called the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service. ``They said, 'Oh, ma'am, if that deer is dead, call the
city or the county,' '' Nancy said. She said the Fish and Wildlife
person also asked her, `` `Just how did that deer die?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, 'I couldn't ask him,' '' Nancy said.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Nancy called the city's Solid Waste Services. She says the
guy on the line told her that city workers weren't allowed to come
on private property to remove the deer and that she'd have to carry
the deer to the curb before it could be picked up.
</P>
<P>
   Lugging that much dead weight to the street seemed daunting to
Nancy. ``I was sure the deer weighed more than I do, besides
smelling,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So Nancy called the city's general number, and talked to a
female city employee about her dead deer. ``She said, 'Don't you
have a son or a neighbor that can drag that deer out?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy then enlisted the help of Mickey Benjamin, 82, who works
at the travel agency Nancy owns. Mickey managed to slide a sheet of
cardboard from a leaf blower box underneath the deer. Then Mickey
and Nancy dragged the deer from the back of the yard to the curb by
yanking on one of the deer's legs.
</P>
<P>
   This was no downstream deer, either. ``It was a great big one _
at least a Great Dane or bigger,'' Nancy said.
</P>
<P>
   By lunchtime, the curbside deer was becoming so ripe that
Nancy's 93-year-old neighbor called to complain about the stench.
``He said, 'I can't even eat my lunch, it smells so bad,' '' Nancy
recalled. `` `Can you call somebody back again?' ''
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon, Nancy says, the city folks came and took away
the deer.
</P>
<P>
   So if you see a deer about to keel over in your yard, go out
there with a pie pan and a spoon and drive it into the neighbor's
yard.

 &HT;    His type still takes pounding
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doug Billheimer thinks he knows what it would have been like to
be a blacksmith at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   When you take in the sign outside his store in Dayton, Ohio _
``The Typewriter Shop,'' with letters in the shape of keys _ you
can't help feeling a sense of anachronism, as if you've stumbled
across a soda shop or an authentic five-and-dime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1914,'' the sign says _ a reminder that the typewriter
is very much a creature of the 20th century. The shiny new
technology of 1900 has now become ``a dying trade,'' Billheimer
concedes.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get him wrong; Billheimer still loves his work, and he's
still quite busy, in part because his business is among a handful
of survivors from more than a dozen area typewriter shops in the
early '80s.
</P>
<P>
   But if he had to do it over again? ``I probably would have gone
a different way,'' says Billheimer, 56. ``It's a shame; it's a
dying art. Now I know how the guy who makes horseshoes felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Or the harness-maker. Or the lithographer. Or any of 1,000
trades once considered indispensable, and now considered archaic.
</P>
<P>
   Once all of them were seen as solid careers, sure bets. What
blacksmith, after all, could have foreseen all the ruckus caused by
that Henry Ford fellow?
</P>
<P>
   Billheimer in 1975 came to work for Ron Tateman, whose family
had owned the business since 1942. Typewriters were ``the thing''
then, computers the young upstart.
</P>
<P>
   When Tateman, 64, started working for his father, in 1950, the
Royal manual was ``king of the hill.'' Now Tateman can't imagine
life without his computer: ``It destroyed my business, but I love
my computer. I can fully understand why the computer replaced the
typewriter, just as I understand why the self-starter replaced the
crank.''
</P>
<P>
   Billheimer, who bought the business from Tateman in 1996, says
that typewriter sales have plummeted, but there is still a strong
demand for service. He makes house calls, office calls. He has
expanded his business to paper shredders and fax machines.
</P>
<P>
   All he needed, when he started out, was a good head for
mechanics. That's a challenge Billheimer _ the kid who always liked
taking things apart and trying to put them back together _ still
relishes: ``I like the challenge of fixing something I've never
seen before, diagnosing the problem and repairing it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's getting harder and harder to find parts for some of the
older machines. ``You have to scrounge parts off another machine,''
Billheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   Look around the Typewriter Shop, and you'll see what Billheimer
means when he says there are ``people who swear by their
typewriters and don't want anything to do with computers.''
</P>
<P>
   There's an Underwood from the '30s. There's a 1950-era Royal, in
shades of military-issue gray-green, that purrs to the touch, still
obviously well-used and well-loved.
</P>
<P>
   Taped to Billheimer's antique cash register is a newspaper ad
from December 1921: ``The Typewriter Shop. Guaranteed typewriters,
new and secondhand. 101 E. Third St.''

   ``That's us,'' Billheimer chuckled. He feels a strong sense of
loyalty to customers who have been coming to the shop for years,
even generations: ``A lot say they come here because they've always
taken it here, and gotten a good deal and we've treated them
fairly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He still has work that absorbs him, skills that people have come
to count on.
</P>
<P>
   He feels, in a word, useful, and not archaic at all.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Feeding wild critters a lesson in politics Orwell
couldn't dream up
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Out my back door, I feed squirrels and birds.
</P>
<P>
   Out my front door, I feed animals that might eat squirrels and
birds.
</P>
<P>
   Since I don't have time to properly care for an animal of my
own, I feed any animal that wants to stop by my house for a
toothsome morsel.
</P>
<P>
   I have lived in places where deer would come up to the back door
for their daily repast. Some of the deer could be hand fed.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to feed deer where I currently live. But the
deer occasionally seen in the nearby creek and woods are skittish.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, once deer lose their fear of people, they can become
pests. They start grazing on your shrubs and flowers. They do this
to force you to put out better food in greater quantities, which
you do.
</P>
<P>
   Then about the time that you think you have put out enough food
to keep your herd of lovable moochers out of your flowers, the word
spreads and more deer show up.
</P>
<P>
   Squirrels also can be demanding. They simply lack an effective
method to force you to put out more food. Screaming at me when I go
into the back yard does not get them any more corn or sunflower
seeds until I'm good and ready.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they send a cute little baby squirrel to stand on his
back legs and look pleadingly in my back door. That works. I'll
stop whatever I'm doing and go outside and put out more squirrel
chow.
</P>
<P>
   A friend built an architecturally splendid squirrel house that
he gave me as a Christmas present. For some reason, the squirrels
won't move in.
</P>
<P>
   I thought it would be entertaining to install a miniature camera
in the squirrel house and watch their domestic interactions.
</P>
<P>
   This would be a form of reality TV with squirrels. I got the
idea from a Web site called Bob's Backyard Squirrels. Bob, a man
from Austin, Texas, put a tiny squirrel cam in his backyard
squirrel house and became a big hit with squirrelly people around
the nation. This was long before ``Survivor'' and ``Big Brother''
became TV hits.
</P>
<P>
   I'll leave it to moralist buddies Joe Lieberman and Bill Bennett
to determine if squirrel voyeurism is a perversion or abusive of
squirrel privacy rights. If it is, a lot of bird watchers, zoo
visitors and others can expect to be castigated by America's
excessively bizarre animal rights outpatients.
</P>
<P>
   A case could be made, I'm sure, that putting food out for
animals is a form of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have long argued that handouts for poor people
make them dependent and take away their incentive to work. The
Democrats want to spend all the Republicans' money in handouts for
poor people as long as they vote Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Since four-legged squirrels don't vote, I don't know how to
judge the politics of feeding squirrels and other animals.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, a case could be made that I abused a fat opossum
found dead in my back yard. At first, I thought he was just playing
possum. Then I realized there was no play left in this obese
marsupial.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are he had been gorging himself every night at the front
yard feeding bowl and eventually had a heart attack waddling home.
It's also possible that this possum inherited a predisposition to
be overweight. Perhaps it was simply his time to check out after
living a long and satisfying life. Who's to say?
</P>
<P>
   The raccoons and other animals that eat at the front of the
house look fit and happy. So do the squirrels and birds that I feed
in the back yard. So I'm not going to feel bad about feeding all
these animals.
</P>
<P>
   I'm beginning to think that my neighbor has the best idea. He
put up a purple martin condo. These entertaining birds swoop around
the neighborhood feeding themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he's a Republican.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com. Please include your name and hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Much has been written about the Concorde in the wake of the
recent crash in France. I'm reminded of another supersonic
transport, the Tupolev 144, developed years ago by the Soviet
Union. Do you have any information about it? Is it still flying?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Tu-144 ``Charger'' never became the wave of the future
that its Soviet supporters and developers hoped.
</P>
<P>
   The first flight of the plane _ which would be dubbed
``Concordsky,'' because it looked so much like the Anglo-French
Concorde, complete with drop nose and delta shape _ was in 1968. On
June 3, 1973, on a demonstration run before it ever entered
passenger service, a Tu-144 exploded and crashed in view of
thousands of spectators at the Paris Air Show. All six crew
members, as well as several people on the ground, were killed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, after several modifications, the Tu-144 was put into
service on mail flights between Moscow and Alma-Ata (now Almaty,
Kazakhstan), basically to collect data and establish safe operating
procedures. Passenger flights began between the cities in 1977, but
after a second crash in that same year, the plane was withdrawn
from service.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the aircraft's troubled past, Tupolev, Russia's leading
aircraft manufacturer, announced plans last month to revive its
supersonic transport program with an updated version, the Tu-244.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, company spokesman Sergei Rayevsky said the July 25
Concorde crash near Paris would not affect research and development
of the Tu-244 which the company hopes to have in the air by the
end of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Which flag is or was called the Southern Cross?
</P>
<P>
   A: That name was applied to the battle flag of the Confederate
States of America.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many seconds should I count between seeing lightning and
hearing thunder to determine how many miles away it is? Also, how
does the wind factor in? I live a mile from an interstate, and when
the wind blows one way it feels like the trucks are in my back
yard. When it blows the other way, there's no traffic noise.
</P>
<P>
   A: For every five seconds that elapse before you hear thunder,
the lightning strike was about 1 mile away, said Greg Forbes,
severe-weather expert at The Weather Channel.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing of highway noise as a function of wind direction is
complicated. The wind speed (usually a few miles per hour at ear
level) is nowhere near the speed of sound (about 700 mph), so wind
speed doesn't cancel out the speed of the sound wave. Sound waves
don't have to travel in straight lines, but also can curve upward
toward outer space or downward into the ground and never reach you.
</P>
<P>
   Both temperature and wind variations between the ground and a
few hundred feet above ground can cause sound waves to bend. When
these two factors cancel each other _ one bending downward and the
other upward _ the traffic noise reaches you. But when the wind
blows from the opposite direction, the wind factor and the
temperature factor bend in the same direction, the sound wave is
strongly bent, and the noise never reaches you.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the ``thermal bending'' can vary with time of day,
too, because the bending is usually upward on sunny days and
downward on clear, calm nights. When both thermal and wind
conditions are optimal (usually on clear, near-calm nights), the
noise can be loudest of all.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported that TV networks have lost interest in
``infomercial'' national political conventions that ``. . . stay on
time like Mussolini's trains.'' What does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: The business about ``informercial'' political conventions
describes how they evolve nowadays, largely devoid of spontaneity
and with careful scripting to meet the timetable, and highlight
party themes and leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The part about ``Mussolini's trains'' refers to Fascist dictator
Benito Mussolini's accomplishment in improving the efficiency of
Italy's railway service in the late '20s and '30s, albeit through
such mechanisms as government control of industry and a Fascist
labor charter that abolished strikes.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Italian people, tired of strikes and riots,
welcomed Mussolini's authority _ provided he could bring order out
of chaos with such moves as stabilizing the national economy,
decreasing unemployment, and improving train service. As a
dictator, he was able to claim success on all those points.
</P>
<P>
   While ``making the trains run on time'' became a defense of the
Fascist ``corporate state'' on the basis of its efficiency, the
expression is nowccessed online?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Transcripts of all the president's speeches and remarks
_ the weekly radio address among them _ can be found on the White
House Web site (www.whitehouse.gov).
</P>
<P>
   In the list of topics at the bottom, click on The Briefing Room.
Then navigate to Virtual Library, where you can click on types of
different documents, including radio addresses. You can select the
date range to find the radio address of your choice, or you can
search radio addresses by topic. Also, the Latest Press Releases
are posted near the top of The Briefing Room, so if you check on a
Saturday, you'll find the radio address among the latest documents.
The address is given at 10:06 a.m., generally each Saturday, said
White House spokesman Steve Boyd.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read that several new flu medicines have been developed.
What are they and what is their development status?
</P>
<P>
   A: The prescription medicine Relenza is on the market already.
It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by Glaxo Wellcome Inc., Relenza is an inhaled powder
spray that is said to reduce the duration of a bout of flu by a day
or two. It also cuts the chances of catching the flu from an ill
relative by 79 percent, according to a study.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is the first of a new class of anti-viral medicines
known as neuraminidase inhibitors that are effective against both
major strains of the disease, known as influenza A and B.
</P>
<P>
   Between 25 million and 50 million Americans typically get the
flu each winter. Doctors emphasize that the flu vaccine is the best
way to ward off the disease, but the new drugs should help when
people fail to get the shots.
</P>
<P>
   Relenza was the first of a new class of flu medicines to reach
the market. Another, Hoffman-LaRoche's Tamiflu, is a similar
medicine in pill form.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Sen. Joseph Lieberman has said he will not travel or work on
the Sabbath. If Al Gore and he win the election and something
happens to Gore, leaving Lieberman in command, will we have a
six-day-a-week president? What happens if there's a major crisis on
his Sabbath?
</P>
<P>
   A: As you say, Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew, observes the Sabbath
by not working, driving or writing from sundown Friday to sundown
Saturday. But there's an exception in Jewish law that allows work
when human life or national security is at stake. He already cites
that exception when he votes on those rare occasions when the
Senate meets in a Saturday session.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I remember reading in Q&AMP;A the ``core values'' created by
Charles Brewer when he founded MindSpring, but could you reprint
them? I hope such values will springboard his entrepreneurial
spirit and insight into his next great endeavor, and maybe inspire
others as well.
</P>
<P>
   A: These are the 10 values, chacterized as ``central to the
success'' of MindSpring Enterprises, which later became EarthLink
(and in which Brewer has sold his holdings):
</P>
<P>
   (1) We respect the individual, and believe that individuals who
are treated with respect and given responsibility respond by giving
their best.
</P>
<P>
   (2) We require complete honesty and integrity in everything we
do.
</P>
<P>
   (3) We make commitments with care, and then live up to them. In
all things, we do what we say we are going to do.
</P>
<P>
   (4) Work is an important part of life, and it should be fun.
Being a good businessperson does not mean being stuffy and boring.
</P>
<P>
   (5) We love to compete, and we believe that competition brings
out the best in us.
</P>
<P>
   (6) We are frugal. We guard and conserve the company's resources
with at least the same vigilance that we would use to guard and
conserve our own personal resources.
</P>
<P>
   (7) We insist on giving our best effort in everything we
undertake. Furthermore, we see a huge difference between ``good
mistakes'' (best effort, bad result) and ``bad mistakes''
(sloppiness or lack of effort).
</P>
<P>
   (8) Clarity in understanding our mission, our goals, and what we
expect from each other is critical to our success.
</P>
<P>
   (9) We are believers in the Golden Rule. In all our dealings we
will strive to be friendly and courteous, as well as fair and
compassionate.
</P>
<P>
   (10) We feel a sense of urgency on any matters related to our
customers. We own problems and we are always responsive. We are

<P>
   Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
</P>
<P>
   c. 2000 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   Q: By constitutional requirement, the number of representatives
per state in the U.S. House is based on population. Does that mean
the number of U.S. citizens in the state, or the general
population?
</P>
<P>
   A: The latter, as determined by the census.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you settle another friendly family discussion? When was
the first color TV?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are several ``firsts,'' as explained in the book
``Famous First Facts.''
</P>
<P>
   The first public demonstration of color television was given on
June 27, 1929, in the Bell Telephone Laboratories in New York. Some
of the objects shown in color were an American flag, a watermelon
and a bunch of roses. The images were of low definition and
mechanically scanned, using three complete systems of photoelectric
cells, amplifers and glow tubes. Each system had a red, blue or
green screen, with a system of mirrors superimposing the three
images to make one combined picture in color.
</P>
<P>
   The first daily color program was Ivan T. Sanderson's ``The
World Is Yours,'' first broadcast on CBS's W2CBS (later to become
WCBS, Channel 2) in New York on June 26, 1951. It depicted the
earth's natural treasures.
</P>
<P>
   The first coast-to-coast live telecast in color was transmitted
on Nov. 3, 1953, from the Colonial Theatre in New York. It starred
Nanette Fabray.
</P>
<P>
   The first regular prime-time series broadcast in color was
``Bonanza,'' which aired on NBC from 1959 to 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any details about Sen. Joe Lieberman's first wife
and their divorce? Is divorce common in Orthodox Judaism?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lieberman and his first wife, Elizabeth Haas, a psychiatrist,
were married in 1965. They had two children. Haas and Lieberman met
while they both worked as interns in the office of Sen. Abraham
Ribicoff (D-Conn.). Their marriage apparently became troubled in
the 1970s, while Lieberman served in the Connecticut state Senate.
His wife filed for divorce in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The following year he met his present wife, Hadassah. She also
had gone through a divorce _ from Gordon Tucker, a rabbi _ and was
raising a 6-year-old son. They were married in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``In Praise of Public Life,'' Lieberman, 58, wrote
about his divorce, saying he and Haas had taken different paths
personally and professionally. He blamed the divorce, in part, on
the demands of his political career. ``No one in my family had ever
divorced,'' he wrote. ``It wasn't supposed to happen to good
people, so divorce to me meant failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Divorce is not stigmatized in the Orthodox community, said Rabbi
Ilan Feldman of Atlanta's Congregation Beth Jacob. ``The divorce
rate is less common than in the general population, but it's not
uncommon,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many balloons were released on the last night of the
Republican National Convention? Who supplied them, and how were
they dropped?
</P>
<P>
   A: The number of red, white and blue balloons was estimated at
about 150,000. The Republican National Committee purchased them
from Balloon Celebrations of Atco, N.J. They were held against the
ceiling of Philadelphia's First Union Center by netting, which was
pulled away to allow them to fall to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The first tropical storm this year was named Alberto. About
six years agotravels by radio airwaves on a cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, experts advise against using a portable/cordless
phone (or a land-line phone) if an electrical storm is in the
immediate vicinity. All of them are electrical devices with wires
associated and some common bonding to a power system. You
especially shouldn't have anything with metal in it connected to
your body _ such as a telephone held next to your ear _ when you're
outdoors during such a storm.
</P>
<P>
   Other tips can be found in your telephone directory, near the
front, on the page headed ``Emergency Preparedness.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: With all the current interest in the Confederate submarine
Hunley, we're wondering about something we saw in Columbus, Ga.,
several years ago. It was in a rather small museum and, as I
recall, was a wooden skeleton of a Confederate submarine. Do you
have any details on this piece of Southern history?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're undoubtedly referring to the Confederate Naval Museum,
which since 1970 has featured the salvaged remains of two
Confederate warships reclaimed from the bottom of the Chattahoochee
River in the 1960s. The 225-foot CSS Jackson, an ironclad ram, and
the 130-foot CSS Chattahoochee, a sail and steam wooden gunboat,
both were set loose in the river at the end of the Civil War and
burned to the waterline. What you probably saw when you visited the
museum was the skeleton of the Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Also featured in the museum is a collection of uniforms,
weapons, models, ordnance and art, all relating to Civil War naval
operations during the period 1861-65. A much larger new museum, to
be named the Port Columbus Civil War Naval Center, is expected to
open next March.
</P>
<P>
   Information _ including photos _ can be found online at
www.tourcolumbus.com/museum/naval.html or
www.portcolumbus.org/pcmain.htm; or call 706-327-9798 or
706-327-9798. Q: Weather forecasters sometimes predict ``isolated
showers,'' and sometimes ``scattered showers.'' What's the
difference?
</P>
<P>
   A: Both terms imply that precipitation will be localized,
meaning there will be precipitation-free space in between, said
Colin Marquis, senior meteorologist at The Weather Channel.
``Scattered'' implies that the coverage will be greater than
``isolated,'' even though they both imply that coverage will be
less than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, Marquis added, is that ``isolated'' means
there's a better chance that your picnic will remain dry.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I often see the term ``statute of limitations.'' What exactly
does it mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: As defined by Black's Law Dictionary, it's a law establishing
a time limit for suing in a civil case, based on the date when the
claim accrued (meaning when the injury occurred or was discovered).
The purpose is ``to require diligent prosecution of known claims,
thereby providing finality and predictability in legal affairs and
ensuring that claims will be resolved while evidence is reasonably
available and fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Another meaning: A statute establishing a time limit for
prosecuting a crime, based on the date when the offense occurred.
After that time period, a suspect cannot be prosecuted. There is no
statute of limitations for murder, however.

 &HT;    Women on the verge of power
 &HT;    By Anne Morris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If pop culture truly leads the way, a woman
being nominated for president by a major party may not be far away
_ though not this year. Promising signs include the President 2000
Barbie doll, a ``Simpsons'' episode in which Lisa grows up to be
president and Glenn Close's convincing appearance as Harrison
Ford's vice president in the 1997 movie ``Air Force One.'' Think
2004 for a woman.
</P>
<P>
   In the new book, ``Madam President: Shattering the Last Glass
Ceiling'' (Scribner, $26), journalists Eleanor Clift and Tom
Brazaitis consider that possibility. ``Getting more women into the
pipeline for the presidency means winning more Senate seats and
governorships,'' they observe. Such offices are the equivalent of
the farm teams in baseball. Currently there are only nine women
among the 100 senators, and only three female governors in 50
states. Why not more?
</P>
<P>
   ``Stereotypes are hard to shake,'' the authors say. And thus
far, few women have been taken seriously by our country as
candidates for higher office. Those who have _ Geraldine Ferraro,
Pat Shroeder, Carol Moseley-Braun _ have sometimes faltered.
</P>
<P>
   Another new book, ``Nine and Counting,'' puts a strong positive
spin on the stories of women who have served in the Senate.
Conscious of how limited their numbers are, the nine current female
senators have collaborated on a book to encourage others to join
them. A support group for one another, they meet monthly for dinner
to discuss the ups and downs they face as minority members of what
is still essentially a boys' club. ``Nine and Counting: The Women
of the Senate,'' by Barbara Mikulski, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Dianne
Feinstein, Barbara Boxer, Patty Murray, Olympia Snowe, Susan
Collins, Mary Landrieu and Blanche Lincoln, written with Catherine
Whitney, (Morrow, $25) shares these women's stories of triumph
against ``great odds.'' (Whitney earlier was the contributing
writer on ``Framing a Life: A Family Memoir'' by Geraldine
Ferraro). Readers will learn how Olympia Snowe of Maine went on to
succeed even after both parents died in a car wreck while she was a
child, and how Mary Landrieu of Louisiana overcame a serious
challenge to her election victory. (Down the road, perhaps Hillary
Rodham Clinton's difficulties will be included, as she assembles
credentials to run for president.)
</P>
<P>
   One name that appears prominently in both new books is that of
Texas Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, giving a clue to her
national importance. With Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., she led the
effort to create ``Nine and Counting.'' In ``Madame President,''
Hutchison is named as a possible future presidential candidate and
as someone who might have been a vice-presidential candidate this
year _ had fellow Texan George W. Bush not been running for
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine and Counting'' begins with an account of what each of the
current nine senators was doing in 1952, the year Democratic
candidate (and liberal god) Adlai Stevenson proudly proclaimed,
``In America, any boy may become president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody even thought to encourage a girl,'' Hutchison commented
last week, by phone from Washington. ``The emphasis was all on
young men.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, Hutchison was 9 and living in La Marque, near
Galveston. ``Nine and Counting's'' description of her is a bit
simplistic. ``She was a busy, gregarious little girl, forever
organizing skits and projects among the neighborhood children and
participating in activities with her Girl Scout troop . . . Kay's
dreams of the future took her . . . to the exciting urban arenas of
Houston and Dallas, where she aspired to a profession in business
or the law.'' (Up, violins.)
</P>
<P>
   Right away, you miss what she's known for. Why don't they
mention her days as a Longhorn cheerleader and UT sorority girl?
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of things were a measure of success for a girl
when I was growing up,'' Hutchison admits. ``But when running for
public office, you want to emphasize other things _ that you can be
firm and credible, and also your experience level. You don't want
to be trivialized . . . In the early parts of my career, I had a
handicap of being trivialized.''
</P>
<P>
   When she attended UT Law School, she was one of five women in
her class. ``They didn't know what to do with us,'' she admits,
though a moment later she insists law school was a great
experience. When she graduated in 1969, she couldn't find a job as
a lawyer, because few firms were hiring women. She found a job
instead as a TV commentator, covering the state Capitol, and that
led her to run for the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   A minor theme running through ``Nine and Counting'' is that
chance plays a large part even in ambitious lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that you're the very best,'' Hutchison said. ``It's
that you're in the right place at the right time. I never intended
to run for the U.S. Senate. . . . It was luck, fate and timing _
with perseverance, hard work and preparation as an overlay.''
</P>
<P>
   She describes how those rejections from law firms were the
beginning of her future, ``even though at the time I thought they
were the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the tone of the book. It's all about overcoming
obstacles. In ``Nine and Counting,'' Hutchison avoids bringing up
extra details like her failedm going to run for president,''
Hutchison said. ``I'm not a person who sits back and makes herself
available as a vice president. If you want the top job, go for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Read together, the two books create a strong picture of women
taking on political life. ``Madam President'' provides more gritty
details than ``Nine and Counting,'' but it also cheats by including
anonymous quotes from a Texas journalist/analyst who _ confronted
by Hutchison's supposed ambition for the top job _ says, ``I'm
saying a prayer for the republic.'' Footnotes at the end of the
book identify many sources, but allow others to remain anonymous _
hardly fair.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison prefers to talk about ``Nine and Counting,'' though
she notes that ``Madam President'' had a different purpose.
``Eleanor (Clift) was writing a book that had as its point: How are
women going to become candidates for president?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine and Counting,'' on the other hand, reads like an
inspirational young adult book. The final chapter offers ``nine
lessons learned.'' Asked if the senators ever thought of turning
this into a children's book, Hutchison appears to consider it.
``We'll have to think about that,'' she said. Girls, after all, are
the target market.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com. Please include your name and hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Much has been written about the Concorde in the wake of the
recent crash in France. I'm reminded of another supersonic
transport, the Tupolev 144, developed years ago by the Soviet
Union. Do you have any information about it? Is it still flying?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Tu-144 ``Charger'' never became the wave of the future
that its Soviet supporters and developers hoped.
</P>
<P>
   The first flight of the plane _ which would be dubbed
``Concordsky,'' because it looked so much like the Anglo-French
Concorde, complete with drop nose and delta shape _ was in 1968. On
June 3, 1973, on a demonstration run before it ever entered
passenger service, a Tu-144 exploded and crashed in view of
thousands of spectators at the Paris Air Show. All six crew
members, as well as several people on the ground, were killed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, after several modifications, the Tu-144 was put into
service on mail flights between Moscow and Alma-Ata (now Almaty,
Kazakhstan), basically to collect data and establish safe operating
procedures. Passenger flights began between the cities in 1977, but
after a second crash in that same year, the plane was withdrawn
from service.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the aircraft's troubled past, Tupolev, Russia's leading
aircraft manufacturer, announced plans last month to revive its
supersonic transport program with an updated version, the Tu-244.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, company spokesman Sergei Rayevsky said the July 25
Concorde crash near Paris would not affect research and development
of the Tu-244, which the company hopes to have in the air by the
end of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Which flag is or was called the Southern Cross?
</P>
<P>
   A: That name was applied to the battle flag of the Confederate
States of America.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many seconds should I count between seeing lightning and
hearing thunder to determine how many miles away it is? Also, how
does the wind factor in? I live a mile from an interstate, and when
the wind blows one way it feels like the trucks are in my back
yard. When it blows the other way, there's no traffic noise.
</P>
<P>
   A: For every five seconds that elapse before you hear thunder,
the lightning strike was about 1 mile away, said Greg Forbes,
severe-weather expert at The Weather Channel.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing of highway noise as a function of wind direction is
complicated. The wind speed (usually a few miles per hour at ear
level) is nowhere near the speed of sound (about 700 mph), so wind
speed doesn't cancel out the speed of the sound wave. Sound waves
don't have to travel in straight lines, but also can curve upward
toward outer space or downward into the ground and never reach you.
</P>
<P>
   Both temperature and wind variations between the ground and a
few hundred feet above ground can cause sound waves to bend. When
these two factors cancel each other _ one bending downward and the
other upward _ the traffic noise reaches you. But when the wind
blows from the opposite direction, the wind factor and the
temperature factor bend in the same direction, the sound wave is
strongly bent, and the noise never reaches you.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the ``thermal bending'' can vary with time of day,
too, because the bending is usually upward on sunny days and
downward on clear, calm nights. When both thermal and wind
conditions are optimal (usually on clear, near-calm nights), the
noise can be loudest of all.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported that TV networks have lost interest in
``infomercial'' national political conventions that ``. . . stay on
time like Mussolini's trains.'' What does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: The business about ``informercial'' political conventions
describes how they evolve nowadays, largely devoid of spontaneity
and with careful scripting to meet the timetable, and highlight
party themes and leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The part about ``Mussolini's trains'' refers to Fascist dictator
Benito Mussolini's accomplishment in improving the efficiency of
Italy's railway service in the late '20s and '30s, albeit through
such mechanisms as government control of industry and a Fascist
labor charter that abolished strikes.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Italian people, tired of strikes and riots,
welcomed Mussolini's authority _ provided he could bring order out
of chaos with such moves as stabilizing the national economy,
decreasing unemployment, and improving train service. As a
dictator, he was able to claim success on all those points.
</P>
<P>
   While ``making the trains run on time'' became a defense of the
Fascist ``corporate state'' on the basis of its efficiency, the
expression is now used only derisively.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can the text of the president's weekly radio address be
accessed online?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Transcripts of all the president's speeches and remarks
_ the weekly radio address among them _ can be found on the White
House Web site (www.whitehouse.gov).
</P>
<P>
   In the list of topics at the bottom, click on The Briefing Room.
Then navigate to Virtual Library, where you can click on types of
different documents, including radio addresses. You can select the
date range to find the radio address of your choice, or you can
search radio addresses by topic. Also, the Latest Press Releases
are posted near the top of The Briefing Room, so if you check on a
Saturday, you'll find the radio address among the latest documents.
The address is given at 10:06 a.m., generally each Saturday, said
White House spokesman Steve Boyd.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read that several new flu medicines have been developed.
What are they and what is their development status?
</P>
<P>
   A: The prescription medicine Relenza is on the market already.
It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by Glaxo Wellcome Inc., Relenza is an inhaled powder
spray that is said to reduce the duration of a bout of flu by a day
or two. It also cuts the chances of catching the flu from an ill
relative by 79 percent, according to a study.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is the first of a new class of anti-viral medicines
known as neuraminidase inhibitors that are effective against both
major strains of the disease, known as influenza A and B.
</P>
<P>
   Between 25 million and 50 million Americans typically get the
flu each winter. Doctors emphasize that the flu vaccine is the best
way to ward off the disease, but the new drugs should help when
people fail to get the shots.
</P>
<P>
   Relenza was the first of a new class of flu medicines to reach
the market. Another, Hoffman-LaRoche's Tamiflu, is a similar
medicine in pill form.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Sen. Joseph Lieberman has said he will not travel or work on
the Sabbath. If Al Gore and he win the election and something
happens to Gore, leaving Lieberman in command, will we have a
six-day-a-week president? What happens if there's a major crisis on
his Sabbath?
</P>
<P>
   A: As you say, Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew, observes the Sabbath
by not working, driving or writing from sundown Friday to sundown
Saturday. But there's an exception in Jewish law that allows work
when human life or national security is at stake. He already cites
that exception when he votes on those rare occasions when the
Senate meets in a Saturday session.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I remember reading in Q&AMP;A the ``core values'' created by
Charles Brewer when he founded MindSpring, but could you reprint
them? I hope such values will springboard his entrepreneurial
spirit and insight into his next great endeavor, and maybe inspire
others as well.
</P>
<P>
   A: These are the 10 values, chacterized as ``central to the
success'' of MindSpring Enterprises, which later became EarthLink
(and in which Brewer has sold his holdings):
</P>
<P>
   (1) We respect the individual, and believe that individuals who
are treated with respect and given responsibility respond by giving
their best.
</P>
<P>
   (2) We require complete honesty and integrity in everything we
do.
</P>
<P>
   (3) We make commitments with care, and then live up to them. In
all things, we do what we say we are going to do.
</P>
<P>
   (4) Work is an important part of life, and it should be fun.
Being a good businessperson does not mean being stuffy and boring.
</P>
<P>
   (5) We love to compete, and we believe that competition brings
out the best in us.
</P>
<P>
   (6) We are frugal. We guard and conserve the company's resources
with at least the same vigilance that we would use to guard and
conserve our own personal resources.
</P>
<P>
   (7) We insist on giving our best effort in everything we
undertake. Furthermore, we see a huge difference between ``good
mistakes'' (best effort, bad result) and ``bad mistakes''
(sloppiness or lack of effort).
</P>
<P>
   (8) Clarity in understanding our mission, our goals, and what we
expect from each other is critical to our success.
</P>
<P>
   (9) We are believers in the Golden Rule. In all our dealings we
will strive to be friendly and courteous, as well as fair and
compassionate.
</P>
<P>
   (10) We feel a sense of urgency on any matters related to our
customers. We own problems and we are always responsive. We are
customer-driven.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: By constitutional requirement, the number of representatives
per state in the U.S. House is based on population. Does that mean
the number of U.S. citizens in the state, or the general
population?
</P>
<P>
   A: The latter, as determined by the census.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you settle another friendly family discussion? When was
the first color TV?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are several ``firsts,'' as explained in the book
``Famous First Facts.''
</P>
<P>
   The first public demonstration of color television was given on
June 27, 1929, in the Bell Telephone Laboratories in New York. Some
of the objects shown in color were an American flag, a watermelon
and a bunch of roses. The images were of low definition and
mechanically scanned, using three complete systems of photoelectric
cells, amplifers and glow tubes. Each system had a red, blue or
green screen, with a system of mirrors superimposing the three
images to make one combined picture in color.
</P>
<P>
   The first daily color program was Ivan T. Sanderson's ``The
World Is Yours,'' first broadcast on CBS's W2CBS (later to become
WCBS, Channel 2) in New York on June 26, 1951. It depicted the
earth's natural treasures.
</P>
<P>
   The first coast-to-coast live telecast in color was transmitted
on Nov. 3, 1953, from the Colonial Theatre in New York. It starred
Nanette Fabray.
</P>
<P>
   The first regular prime-time series broadcast in color was
``Bonanza,'' which aired on NBC from 1959 to 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any details about Sen. Joe Lieberman's first wife
and their divorce? Is divorce common in Orthodox Judaism?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lieberman and his first wife, Elizabeth Haas, a psychiatrist,
were married in 1965. They had two children. Haas and Lieberman met
while they both worked as interns in the office of Sen. Abraham
Ribicoff (D-Conn.). Their marriage apparently became troubled in
the 1970s, while Lieberman served in the Connecticut state Senate.
His wife filed for divorce in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The following year he met his present wife, Hadassah. She also
had gone through a divorce _ from Gordon Tucker, a rabbi _ and was
raising a 6-year-old son. They were married in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``In Praise of Public Life,'' Lieberman, 58, wrote
about his divorce, saying he and Haas had taken different paths
personally and professionally. He blamed the divorce, in part, on
the demands of his political career. ``No one in my family had ever
divorced,'' he wrote. ``It wasn't supposed to happen to good
people, so divorce to me meant failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Divorce is not stigmatized in the Orthodox community, said Rabbi
Ilan Feldman of Atlanta's Congregation Beth Jacob. ``The divorce
rate is less common than in the general population, but it's not
uncommon,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many balloons were released on the last night of the
Republican National Convention? Who supplied them, and how were
they dropped?
</P>
<P>
   A: The number of red, white and blue balloons was estimated at
about 150,000. The Republican National Committee purchased them
from Balloon Celebrations of Atco, N.J. They were held against the
ceiling of Philadelphia's First Union Center by netting, which was
pulled away to allow them to fall to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The first tropical storm this year was named Alberto. About
six years ago, an Alberto struck south Georgia. Why is the name
being recycled so soon?
</P>
<P>
   A: Another Alberto indeed did strike Georgia, stalling over the
southwestern part of the state in 1994. It dumped 24 inches of rain
in 24 hours, causing widespread flooding around the Flint River.
</P>
<P>
   Names for Atlantic and Eastern Pacific storms are on
alphabetical lists that are recycled every six years. So there's an
Alberto in 2000; there will be one with that name in 2006; again in
2012; and so on.
</P>
<P>
   There's one exception to the repeats. If a land-falling storm
has major economic impact or causes major human disaster because of
its severity, the name is retired and replaced. Thus, for example,
the name Hugo no longer appears on the list of Atlantic storm
names.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A reported that it isn't a good idea to talk on a telephone
during a lightning storm, because an electrical current from the
lightning can travel down the wire. What about a cordless phone?
</P>
<P>
   A: You don't have the same exposure to lightning risk, because
you're not attached to a line that the lightning could travel
through. Radio airwaves aren't conducive when it comes to energy,
and your voice travels by radio airwaves on a cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, experts advise against using a portable/cordless
phone (or a land-line phone) if an electrical storm is in the
immediate vicinity. All of them are electrical devices with wires
associated and some common bonding to a power system. You
especially shouldn't have anything with metal in it connected to
your body _ such as a telephone held next to your ear _ when you're
outdoors during such a storm.
</P>
<P>
   Other tips can be found in your telephone directory, near the
front, on the page headed ``Emergency Preparedness.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: With all the current interest in the Confederate submarine
Hunley, we're wondering about something we saw in Columbus, Ga.,
several years ago. It was in a rather small museum and, as I
recall, was a wooden skeleton of a Confederate submarine. Do you
have any details on this piece of Southern history?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're undoubtedly referring to the Confederate Naval Museum,
which since 1970 has featured the salvaged remains of two
Confederate warships reclaimed from the bottom of the Chattahoochee
River in the 1960s. The 225-foot CSS Jackson, an ironclad ram, and
the 130-foot CSS Chattahoochee, a sail and steam wooden gunboat,
both were set loose in the river at the end of the Civil War and
burned to the waterline. What you probably saw when you visited the
museum was the skeleton of the Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Also featured in the museum is a collection of uniforms,
weapons, models, ordnance and art, all relating to Civil War naval
operations during the period 1861-65. A much larger new museum, to
be named the Port Columbus Civil War Naval Center, is expected to
open next March.
</P>
<P>
   Information _ including photos _ can be found online at
www.tourcolumbus.com/museum/naval.html or
www.portcolumbus.org/pcmain.htm; or call 706-327-9798 or
706-327-9798. Q: Weather forecasters sometimes predict ``isolated
showers,'' and sometimes ``scattered showers.'' What's the
difference?
</P>
<P>
   A: Both terms imply that precipitation will be localized,
meaning there will be precipitation-free space in between, said
Colin Marquis, senior meteorologist at The Weather Channel.
``Scattered'' implies that the coverage will be greater than
``isolated,'' even though they both imply that coverage will be
less than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, Marquis added, is that ``isolated'' means
there's a better chance that your picnic will remain dry.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I often see the term ``statute of limitations.'' What exactly
does it mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: As defined by Black's Law Dictionary, it's a law establishing
a time limit for suing in a civil case, based on the date when the
claim accrued (meaning when the injury occurred or was discovered).
The purpose is ``to require diligent prosecution of known claims,
thereby providing finality and predictability in legal affairs and
ensuring that claims will be resolved while evidence is reasonably
available and fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Another meaning: A statute establishing a time limit for
prosecuting a crime, based on the date when the offense occurred.
After that time period, a suspect cannot be prosecuted. There is no
statute of limitations for murder, however.

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ When you take in the sign outside Doug
Billheimer's store in Dayton, Ohio _ ``The Typewriter Shop,'' with

ATTACK OF THE NAUGHTY WEB SITES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY   
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: When I type in the first letter of a Web
address, another address appears below the address line. It has the
same beginning letter and is an objectionable site. How can I rid
my computer of the site?
</P>
<P>
   _ Embarrassed
</P>
<P>
   DEAR EMBARRASSED: Someone's been very naughty behind your back,
because I know with utmost certainty that none of my readers would
EVER think about going to smut sites. Or at least getting caught.
</P>
<P>
   You are a victim of Internet Explorer's AutoComplete, a dubious
``enhancement'' that attempts to guess what you're typing. It's
handy for filling in Web-based forms, but pretty annoying when it
starts guessing ``www.yasminenude.com'' when you're trying to get
to Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Go to Internet Options in the Tools menu, then pick the Content
tab and look for the AutoComplete button. You'll be able to turn
AutoComplete off and dump what it's got stored.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lot easier if you go to www.swanksoft.com and download
HistoryKill 2000. It can clean out just about anything that
Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator stash.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: How can I change a Word art extension from .Doc
to .Jpg or .Bmp? I can move the file into my photo program, but I
can't edit it because it still has the .Doc extension.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wassssssuuuupppp Doc
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DOC: Just changing the file extension isn't going to turn
the file into a graphic. Here's what I do every month when I get
the latest Yasmine Newsletter, which arrives as a Word document.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures of my wife _ well, she's not really my wife yet _
are components of the document that can be separated. I generally
right-click on the picture, then select Copy from the pop-up menu.
Then I paste the picture into Paint Shop Pro. I can either save it
in just about any format or print it out.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: How do I download the OPL3-SAx driver to fix my
laptop?
</P>
<P>
   _ Asleep at the Wheel
</P>
<P>
   DEAR ASLEEP: You, ummmm, download it. You'll probably find it on
the laptop manufacturer's Web site, along with installation
instructions. In general, click on the download link and save it to
a folder on your computer where you can find it later. Then read
the instructions. Even Yasmine knows enough to do that.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: About your recent column covering blank boxes
on the task bar. Well, a little dose of RegClean (download from the
Microsoft site) can handle that. Boxes are left over from very low
resources. I hope you don't get paid to do this column.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Answer Man
</P>
<P>
   DEAR THE: Actually, I get paid to KEEP doing it after reading
letters from all the pinheads out there who think they know it all.
Listen, Sparky, we already know the problem is caused by low
resources. We want to know what's draining the resources, and why
it seems to happen after doing a Windows update. RegClean is a good
tool for examining the Registry, but it only fixes known problems.
I run it every week, and I still have the boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, didn't mean to get that worked up. I need to review my
collection of Yasmine photos and relax.
</P>
<P>
   (Anybody with the real answer or Yasmine Bleeth's home number
can write Dr. Emilio Bombay at drbombay(at)star-telegram.com
(snail-mail: Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Box 1870, Fort Worth, TX
76101). Fax: (817) 390-7257. In real life, Dr. Bombay is Michael

DUKE'S ON THE INTERNET STUMP, CAMPAIGNING TO BEAT THE BLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You know what the presidential campaign needs? A little more
outrage, that's what. In years past, the Republican National
Convention was known to get the blood boiling in certain liberal
ZIP codes. But with all that hand-holding and hugging going on this
year, the only folks watching are the insomniacs _ and maybe the
saccharine manufacturers. It's hard to get riled up about
dispassionate complacency, or whatever it's called.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a candidate worth hating. He's a compassionate
fascist who wants to make gun ownership mandatory. He proposes a
fat tax on people who take up too much room. The budget surplus:
He's all for it. Even his chief handler admits that the candidate
is a shallow opportunist who would sell out for the highest price.
</P>
<P>
   Get that man on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Duke, of course, is the gonzo creation of ``Doonesbury''
cartoonist Garry Trudeau. The chain-smoking character has stepped
off the comic pages to run for president with a high-tech,
multimedia campaign. Of course, he has a Web site,
www.duke2000.com. (``If you don't work that into your article in at
least six places, you're as ungrateful as you are drop-dead
gorgeous,'' the candidate says, speaking through Trudeau.)
</P>
<P>
   Duke is brought to life by the latest animation and
motion-capture technologies, which can add a bit of
unpredictability to the mix. The campaign was launched in February
at the US Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen, Colo., where a 3-D version
of Duke spoke to the audience in real time _ until the computer
crashed, that is. Duke, originally modeled after writer Hunter S.
Thompson, has ingested a fair share of pharmaceuticals over the
years, so it could have been an acid flashback.
</P>
<P>
   So what brings Trudeau, who won a Pulitzer Prize for drawing
``little pictures of the Nixon White House,'' to the Internet?
``I'm not drawn for the usual reasons _ greed and fear _ because
I'm neither poor nor scared about the future of my industry,'' he
says in an e-mail interview. However, he notes that when he gave a
talk at Stanford University earlier this year, some of the students
had never read ``Doonesbury'' in a newspaper, but had seen it
online. ``Although I personally love the little static black and
white drawings I've spent my life sketching on rag paper (and can't
foresee ever giving up), I am skeptical that a generation that's
grown up experiencing the world through screens will support comics
as I've known them.''
</P>
<P>
   That same generation, though, has also grown up with instant
``top 10'' lists, frank discussions of presidential private parts,
and dancing excretory products on ``South Park.'' How do you do
satire in such an age? ``This question _ how do you top reality? _
has been asked for as long as I've been working. I heard it a lot
during Watergate,'' says Trudeau, who contends that there are more
satirists working today than ever before. Indeed, anyone who feels
like it can produce parody on the Internet: Witness Zack Exley of
Somerville, who was threatened by George W. Bush for his mock
campaign site.
</P>
<P>
   But certainly, most amateur satirists don't actually have the
privilege of receiving such threats. It's hard to shock anyone
these days. ``The main difference is that the taste bar has not
only been lowered, but buried. Anybody can say anything,'' Trudeau
says. ``I think `South Park' might have marked the end of all
satiric restraint in mainstream popular culture. After all, if
you're not going to be offended by a singing turd, then what's
left? It's not political shenanigans that have become so extreme as
to resist parody _ it's the tools of parody that have reached their
limit.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Duke. He's always been what Trudeau describes
as ``a towering symbol of ignorance and bigotry,'' more of a
farcical figure than a satirical character. Trudeau insists the
whole campaign is strictly for entertainment. ``I mean, obviously,
we're trashing everything Duke stands for _ his naked opportunism,
his self-aggrandizement, his callousness and corruption. But it's
not with any grandiose agenda in mind,'' says Trudeau. He doesn't
want us to care one way or another about Duke: He just wants us to
be entertained by him.
</P>
<P>
   And you have to admit, that's what politics is all about these
days, anyway. Duke works as a candidate precisely because his
extremes are so entertaining. None of that bland,
middle-of-the-road pandering for this guy. (On censorship: ``You
have to remember that one person's porn site is another person's
social life.'') None of that namby-pamby multiculturalism for this
fellow. He's right out there with those recycled platitudes,
promising to ``be the ferret in the pants of the government'' and
``to build a bridge back to the 20th century.'' And he even
balanced out his ticket with the perfect prepackaged running mate:
Kathie Lee.
</P>
<P>
   If the Duke campaign proves anything (and Trudeau doesn't harbor
any pretensions here), it's that a candidate these days can succeed
only if he is a master of all mediums. His site (that's
www.duke2000.com, OK?) features a weekly video, and this week's is
a harangue about the Internet and personal privacy. It crashed my
computer just as Duke got to the part about abolishing the census
for women and minorities. As much as we love to hate this guy, his
candidacy is doomed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  Back when Trudeau started drawing ``Doonesbury,'' college
kids were united around issues like civil rights and the Vietnam
War. What does the Net generation have? Napster. ``It hasn't
escaped me that none of my three kids has purchased a CD since
Christmas,'' he says. ``We're raising a nation of pirates. As a
professional troublemaker, I'm pleased, of course. But as a content
provider, I'm appalled. Either way, there's no turning back. We all
better adapt.''

FIRMS AGREE TO BUILD A BETTER MODEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I recently bought my last modem, a US Robotics device that
offers speeds of up to 56,000 bits per second, and usually delivers
about 50,000. But 50 kilobits is far slower than today's DSL and
cable modem systems, and I'm looking to step up to broadband.
</P>
<P>
   But what about those who can't? There are still millions of
people for whom high-speed digital Net connections are out of
geographic or financial range. For years to come, these people will
be saddled with slow analog modems.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the low speed of these modems may not be their worst
drawback. Ironically, nobody knows this better than those with
high-speed Internet access. I've got it here at the Globe, and so I
can download multimegabyte files in a minute or two. And yet, what
makes the service really valuable is that it's always on. That
means I can call up a Web page at a whim, or fire off an e-mail
with a click.
</P>
<P>
   Most Web pages come up almost as fast on a 56K modem as they do
here at the Globe, and it takes almost exactly as long to send a
brief e-mail. But with a modem, there's a dialing delay to clutter
up the process. And if you're stingy like me, and have just one
phone line, using the Internet stops you from getting or receiving
voice phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   DSL and cable modem services are popular in large part because
they eliminate the need to dial, free up your voice line, and
provide ``always-on'' service. These are pleasures that analog
modem users can never fully enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   But soon they'll be able to get pretty close. It turns out that
the 56K modem isn't the last word in analog data transmission after
all. By year's end, modem makers say they'll have prepared a new
modem standard called V.92 that can provide what might be called
``almost-always-on'' Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot to like about the new plan _ the absence of
fratricidal stupidity, for instance. In 1997, two incompatible
techniques were invented for making 56K modems, and the industry
practically self-destructed before finally adopting the uniform
V.90 standard.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the modem makers, fearful of repeating the 56K sales
slump of 1998, are all singing from one hymnal. They've already
begun tests to ensure their products all work together. The
official V.92 standard is set for final ratification by the
International Telecommunications Union in September, and the first
V.92 products should be on sale in time for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   So what will consumers get from the new standard? Well, there's
a bit of a speed bump. Remember that today's V.90s only receive
data at 56K; the fastest you can send data is just 33K. Under V.92,
the upload speed should rise to about 48K. Since most modem users
don't send a lot of data, this amounts to a marginal improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The other two enhancements look a lot more useful. When two
modems meet, they go through an elaborate ``handshaking'' process
to settle on the right speed and data protocols. They repeat this
process every time, as if they'd never met before. But most modem
users always dial the same number, so the protocols never change.
</P>
<P>
   V.92 takes advantage of this fact. ``The modem begins to become
intelligent and becomes familiar with the circuit you're dialing
into,'' says Mike Tramontano, marketing director of Motorola Inc.'s
modem software operation in Mansfield. A full handshake happens the
first time you dial a number; on redials, most of the process is
skipped. Tramontano says this cuts dial-up time in half.
</P>
<P>
   The new modems will also have a built-in ``hold'' feature. If a
phone call comes in while you're surfing, a signal will flash on
your monitor. You'll be able to interrupt the Internet connection,
take the phone call, then hop right back on to the Net without
having to redial. Again, the modem's ability to remember the
characteristics of a phone line is supposed to make the reconnect
quick and reliable.
</P>
<P>
   V.92 won't help you download three-megabyte music files any
faster. For tasks like that, there's no substitute for brute
bandwidth. But for the sort of workaday Web surfing and e-mailing I
usually do, a quick Internet connection can be more valuable than a
fast one. Besides, dial-up service is still cheaper than broadband,
and the new V.92s should hit the market in just a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, my new US Robotics box might not be my last
modem after all.

BEIJING'S QUANDARY: PROMOTING INTERNET USE AND CONTROLLING IT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ China's unease with the Internet is growing as
the country embraces the new medium to modernize its economy yet
worries about the Web's spread beyond government control.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, the government-sponsored State Research
Information Technology Co. said it had hired a California company
to help set up electronic commerce sites for thousands of
government companies. And it claims to own China's first patented
Wireless Application Protocol system, which could greatly expand
Internet access in a country where cellular telephones vastly
outnumber personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the government pushes its own Internet ventures, it
is trying to stamp out others that it sees as a potential political
threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enemy forces at home and abroad are sparing no effort to use
this battlefront to infiltrate us,'' said an editorial this week in
the Communist Party's national newspaper, the People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
   The warning followed renewed reports that local governments are
establishing Internet surveillance units and tracking down people
who use the Web to express political dissent or other nonconformist
ideas. The government shut one such Web site, www.xinwenming.com,
this week for posting ``counterrevolutionary content,'' a euphemism
that often means nothing more than criticism of the government.
Police are searching for the Web site's organizers, according to
New York-based Human Rights in China.
</P>
<P>
   The government's deep ambivalence toward the Internet, which
Beijing fears could be used to unite political opposition to the
Communist Party, has slowed the medium's development here. And it
threatens to distort the new industry in much the way the country's
planned economy distorted other industries in the past, favoring
inefficient government-owned ventures over more creative private
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the government's heavy hand has cast a pall overprivate
Web ventures, which are relying on foreign investment to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Regulations that make much of the foreign investment technically
illegal and the inability of Internet companies to list their
shares on China's domestic stock market are scaring off venture
capitalists who were still pumping money into the sector just a few
weeks ago. Many of the tiny Internet companies started in the past
year are now running out of cash and closing.
</P>
<P>
   Internet entrepreneurs say government interference has cost the
nascent industry hundreds of millions of dollars in investment
capital that could have helped close the gap between it and the
Internet industry in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Had Beijing moved more quickly, the critics say, many Chinese
Internet companies could have listed their shares on Nasdaq before
that market tumbled in April and the American public's appetite for
Internet plays waned.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Beijing dithered and by the time it began allowing
Chinese companies to list abroad, the moment had passed. The shares
of the last two Chinese Internet companies to list on Nasdaq,
Netease.com and Sohu.com, are trading at about half of their
initial offering prices. Other Chinese Internet stock offerings
have been postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, China's state-owned ventures are failing to generate
much excitement among the venture capital community that has
watched the Internet develop elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the government initiatives which don't have a strong
involvement with the private sector do face the risk of failure,''
said David Williams, a Hong Kong-based partner at the American
venture-capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its threatening rhetoric and a few widely publicized
arrests, Beijing appears to be failing in its efforts to control
unauthorized information flows. The government estimates that 17
million people are connected to the Internet so far, and that
number is doubling every six months while a plethora of Web sites
are popping up each day.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one popular Web site, www.homeway.com, which
regularly posts unconfirmed news reports from the Hong Kong press,
has reported for weeks that Li Jizhou, vice minister of Public
Security, is in Beijing's Qincheng Prison awaiting trial for taking
bribes worth millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   And despite having arrested Internet activist Huang Qi, who
faces charges of subversion after posting information about the
1989 massacre that ended pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen
Square, Huang's Web site, www.6-4tianwang.com, remains up for
people to see.

 &HT;    EPA'S COMPUTERS EASY PREY TO HACKERS, REPORT SAYS
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's
information systems have been ``riddled with security weaknesses''
that allowed frequent intrusions by foreign and domestic computer
hackers, a government study warns.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. General Accounting Office, the bipartisan investigative
arm of Congress, reported Friday that it found more than two-dozen
instances in which the EPA's database was compromised or misused.
</P>
<P>
   In July of last year, for example, a group of hackers set up a
``chat room'' on an EPA network server to conduct on-line
conversations. In another case, the EPA failed to notice a
sophisticated penetration of three agency computers until it was
notified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
   At risk is the nation's chief repository of environmental
information. The EPA keeps records on health and safety assessments
and private businesses, as well as data on contracting and
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Hackers skilled enough to bypass the security can access much of
this information through the Internet, where it is then subject to
disruption, fraud and improper disclosure, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer security risks are significant, and they are
growing,'' said the congressional investigating office, which put
the EPA on a list of 22 federal agencies which have lax database
security.
</P>
<P>
   After preliminary findings of such security lapses last
February, the EPA shut down its computer network temporarily for an
overhaul. Congressional investigators said they have not yet
assessed the modifications.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting office noted that most of the serious problems
had been identified by the agency's own inspector general first in
1997 and again in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The latest findings drew a sharp critique from House Commerce
chairman Tom Bliley, R-Va.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's ``cyber-security policy amounts to
little more than paper pushing,'' said Bliley, who had requested
the audit of EPA and is now seeking similar investigations of the
Food and Drug Administration and the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   In its response to the security audit, the EPA's deputy
administrator Margaret N. Schneider said that the agency had
accelerated plans to erect a ``firewall'' to protect sensitive data
and has begun to implement ``aggressive, corrective responses'' to
remedy the security problems.

WOMEN ONLINE GO BEYOND FUN; KINKO'S AND FEDEX PLAN SERVICE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNET IS MORE THAN JUST FUN FOR WOMEN &QL; 
 &LR;  Women, it is clear, are not passing hour upon hour at their
computers watching the online equivalent of ``General Hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   A new survey shows that women go online for practical reasons,
like shopping, travel reservations and to seek specific
information, and tend to be loyal to a few chosen sites. Men, on
the other hand, tend to roam around, sometimes looking for
amusement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is one thing women don't want to do online: linger in
front of their monitors with a cup of Cafe Vienna,'' said Jesse
Berst, editor of ZDNet Anchor Desk, an industry newsletter. The
reason? Simply put: ``Women are more pressed for time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, ``It's a Woman's World Wide Web,'' was conducted by
Jupiter Communications with Media Metrix. Besides examining the
sexes' online behavior, it showed that for the first time, women
outnumber men online, with a 50.4 percent share of the online
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are interested in a more efficient experience _ getting
online and getting off,'' said Anya Sacharow, an analyst at
Jupiter. ``Men are more interested in technology for technology's
sake, and in the more random aspects of Net surfing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacharow said the survey pointed to different priorities. Women
are ``often juggling kids, jobs and taking care of the house,'' she
said. ``Men more often than not are only responsible for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The study found that older women use the Internet to make their
lives easier. Bolstering this notion that women go online to
simplify their lives rather than fulfill them, the study found that
many consumer product sites had disproportionate numbers of female
visitors.
</P>

<P>
   &UR; KINKO'S AND FEDEX PLAN DOCUMENT SERVICE &QL; 
 &LR;  Kinkos.com, an online start-up, has announced a deal with the
Kinko's chain of copy shops and FedEx to create a service that
promises to deliver finished presentations and reports within a few
hours of receiving the data.
</P>
<P>
   Online document delivery services, so far offered only by a
small number of start-ups with names like Mimeo.com and
NowDocs.com, have struck a chord with business travelers and others
who want to transmit documents to printing shops for formatting,
proofread them on screen and have them delivered throughout the
country at designated times.
</P>
<P>
   Kinkos.com was formed March 1 as a separate company from Kinko's
Inc., the nation's largest chain of copy and document preparation
stores. Its financial backers include Kinko's and America Online.
</P>
<P>
   The three-way deal, announced last week, will use the 1,000
Kinko's stores and FedEx's delivery network.
</P>
<P>
   ``What customers need is `time definite,''' said Rick Steele,
Kinkos.com's chief executive, meaning they want to know exactly
when their documents will be delivered. With the new service,
customers can have finished documents within four hours in 20 major
markets; the companies plan to add 35 more by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, the service, called Print to Kinko's, will
be on both the FedEx and Kinkos.com Web sites. The deal with FedEx
will allow the companies to scale the operation quickly as customer
demand grows, said David Roussain, FedEx vice president for
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   FedEx already operates service centers in 50 Kinko's stores; it
plans to increase that number to 150 in about nine months.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BECKY WARING   
 c.2000 The San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A home computer has become an absolute necessity
for school-age children. Fortunately, prices have fallen so far
that most families should be able to afford one. Whether for
homework, Web cruising, e-mail or game-playing, the computer will
likely become the focal point of many home activities. Here's how
to choose one with the right features and the right price.
</P>
<P>
   We have chosen three PCs for varying budgets, plus an Apple iMac
model. All have everything your child needs for school activities.
Some go a lot further, such as adding multimedia playback
capabilities and even the ability to make your own music CDs.
Buying the best you can afford provides some measure of protection
against premature obsolescence, always a consideration with
computer purchases. You will also likely get a much more versatile
and expandable machine.
</P>
<P>
   As for buying the computer, we recommend scouting out the
build-to-order options on most every vendor's Web site (Apple,
Compaq, Dell, Gateway, Hewlett-Packard and Sony all have extensive
online stores, among others). This lets you save money by tailoring
a system to your exact needs.
</P>
<P>
   Features to Look For:
</P>
<P>
   -- Processor/RAM. Budget-conscious desktop buyers looking for
deals for less than $1,000 should consider models with Intel
Celeron and AMD K6-2 processors. Clock speeds around 500 MHz are
just fine for most schoolwork and game playing. You will compromise
on things like 3-D and video horsepower. For serious multimedia
capabilities, look to the Intel Pentium III line and clock speeds
in the 600 to 700 MHz range. Don't overspend on the clock speed
however. A couple hundred extra bucks is probably better allocated
to more memory (get at least 64 MB, or 128 MB for multimedia) and
add-ons such as a CD recorder.
</P>
<P>
   -- Software/Operating System. We recommend Windows 98 over
Windows 2000 for both portables and desktops due to ease-of-use and
compatibility issues. Windows Millennium Edition is coming soon,
however, and may even be shipping by the time you get around to
buying. At the least, ask your salesperson if you can get a coupon
for an upgrade to Window ME when you buy your new computer.
</P>
<P>
   All our recommended systems (except the iMac) include Microsoft
Word and virus-scanning utilities. Most also include an array of
home and educational software. If you are buying a first computer,
online build-to-order vendors like Dell and Gateway also offer
special add-on software value packs that are inexpensive ways to
start building your library.
</P>
<P>
   -- Storage. It's a general rule that however much hard-disk
space you buy, you will quickly fill it up, especially in these
days of huge digital-camera picture files and MP3 music downloads.
We have therefore ``specced out'' our recommended systems with
hefty hard disks, typically 20 to 30 GB. On the higher-end systems,
we also recommend a DVD-ROM drive. You will likely want to add it
on in the near future, and it's cheaper and easier to get it built
in. Another popular extra is a CD-recorder, which is included in
the Sony multimedia-oriented system in our chart. You can add it on
to most build-to-order models.
</P>
<P>
   -- Expansion. All the PC desktops in our chart have plenty of
expansion capability, being tower models. The compact iMac is an
exception. The PCs have varying numbers of USB ports (the new
standard for attaching peripherals like printers and scanners),
serial and parallel ports, and miscellaneous audio and video
connections. They also have extra PCI slots and drive bays for
internal expansion. Because there are so many different home
networking schemes, we didn't price the systems with Ethernet, but
add about $50 for a network card if you need one.
</P>
<P>
   -- Monitor. All our choices include a monitor in the price;
there are two 15-inch models, and two 17-inchers. The extra $100 or
so for a 17-inch monitor is well worth the price. There's more
screen real estate for viewing Web sites and working with multiple
applications, or you can use the extra space to increase pixel size
and ease eyestrain. The 15-inch screens are usually viewed at
800x600 or 1024x768, 17-inchers at 1024x768 or 1280x1024. A given
resolution, for example 1024x768, that looks cramped at 15 inches
will be easy to read at 17 inches.
</P>
<P>
   If you really want to splurge, you might also consider a
flat-screen LCD monitor. These are a lot more expensive than
traditional CRT monitors, but look great and save space.
</P>
<P>
   -- Warranty and Technical Support. Of the four vendors shown
here, Dell has the most generous warranty and tech support
features. Other vendors tend to limit the amount of time you can
make calls related to software issues, although all have one-year
hardware warranty and tech support. All four vendors have excellent
online tech support areas, which are the first place to turn when
you have a problem or need a software driver.
</P>
<P>
   The Budget Saver:
</P>
<P>
   -- Dell Dimension L566cx. Dell is sort of the Wal-Mart of
computing: It has all the most popular products at the lowest
prices possible, backed by good quality and service. The Dimension
line goes all the way to the high end, but we chose the entry-level
model as a paragon of price and performance. The L566cx has all the
basics for home and education, just lacking bells and whistles such
as DVD drives and superfast processors. Keep in mind that you can
customize any Dell with various add-ons, so be careful not to run
up the bill when you start shopping.
</P>
<P>
   The Mid-Priced Speedster:
</P>
<P>
   -- HP Pavilion. HP's Pavilion line is squarely aimed at the home
user and offers excellent value for the money. Rather than going
for one of the off-the-shelf models, we specced out a machine with
a 17-inch screen, 733 MHz Pentium III, top-notch video card,
DVD-ROM drive, 128 MB of RAM and 15 GB hard disk for just $1,271.
It also comes with all the right consumer software in a
well-designed case. What more can you ask? Well, maybe a
CD-rewritable drive or inkjet printer, two bases that HP has
covered in spades, being a market leader in each. Just add them to
your build-to-order list.
</P>
<P>
   The Multimedia Maven:
</P>
<P>
   -- Sony PCV-R553DS VAIO Digital Studio. If you want to go beyond
the basics to get a real multimedia powerhouse, Sony's Digital
Studio lives up to its name. It has an almost dizzying array of
software for editing digital images and movies, even creating Web
video, and has built-in i.LINK (IEEE 1394) ports for DV camcorders.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, it has dual DVD-ROM and CD-RW drives. This lets you
copy files easily from one to the other, for backup purposes or for
making custom CD-audio mix discs. The 17-inch flat Trinitron screen
is also much higher quality than the run-of-the-mill models you
will find in most consumer systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Mac Alternative:
</P>
<P>
   -- Apple iMac DV+. Apple rolled out its new iMac line a couple
weeks ago. As usual, the focus is on multimedia. If you have seen
Apple's TV commercials, you have already guessed that the iMac DV
is the cheapest and easiest way to get into editing video with your
DV camcorder. We recommend the iMac DV+ for its 30 GB hard disk,
DVD-ROM drive and 450 MHz PowerPC G3 processor, which outperforms
Pentium IIIs with much higher clock speeds.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac DV+ is also a great multimedia playback machine, with
its Harman-Kardon speakers, fast video card with 3-D acceleration
and special theater-screen mode, which increases brightness while
playing movies. In a dorm room, it can double as an entertainment
center for CDs and DVD movies.

INTERNET IN JAPAN IS RIDING A WIRELESS WAVE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By JOHN MARKOFF  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ To understand how different the development of the
Internet has been in Japan than in the United States, consider the
plight of Hiroaki Kobayashi.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran telecommunications entrepreneur who started one of the
first modem companies in Japan and then sold it to AT&AMP;T, Kobayashi
is now the president and founder of Tokyo Metallic, a struggling
Japanese provider of high-speed, or broadband, Internet access
lines.
</P>
<P>
   His company is trying to jump start the development of a type of
broadband telephone-line technology known as digital subscriber
loop, or DSL. But while Internet access through DSL is booming in
the United States, Kobayashi's business is barely sputtering. There
are fewer than 1,000 DSL customers in Japan, split between his
company and one lone competitor.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the incumbent Bell phone companies and
their start-up competitors, known as CLEC's, are now closing in on
a million DSL subscribers nationally, according to the Cahners
Instat market research group. And Internet access by high-speed
cable television lines is quickly reaching even higher numbers in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But in Japan, Tokyo Metallic's tiny band of entrepreneurs is
facing many obstacles, not the least of which is the giant Japanese
telephone company Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which currently
has a competing strategy for wiring Japan with high-speed fiber
optic cables.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Japanese telephone industry invested heavily in an
early version of a digital technology known as ISDN _ a type of
phone service much slower than DSL and only slightly faster than
modem data sent over a standard, analog phone line that many people
in the United States still use for Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Although NTT has recently made overtures to the American DSL
companies, industry executives said that the telecom giant was in
no rush to invest in DSL _ in part because it is still anxious to
retrieve its investment in ISDN.
</P>
<P>
   For all the landline forces working against him, though, the
biggest challenge to Kobayashi's vision of wiring Japan has nothing
to do with wires at all. Just the opposite, in fact. The Japanese
are heading onto the Internet in droves _ by wireless means.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, according to InfoCom Research, there are between 20
million and 27 million Internet users in Japan, or approximately
one of every five people in the nation. Of that number, nearly half
_ some 10 million _ are connecting to the Internet wirelessly. Of
these wireless customers, 7.5 million are using a service called
i-mode, offered by NTT DoCoMo, NTT's wireless division. For nearly
two of three i-mode users, this wireless link is their only method
of access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   InfoCom forecasts that the percent of Japanese population
connected wirelessly to the Internet will increase to more than 85
percent by 2003, compared with only about 60 percent connected by
fixed-line networks.
</P>
<P>
   That trend suggests that people here are likely to use and
experience the Internet much differently than they do in the United
States, where so far only a fraction of Internet users have
wireless access.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's wireless Internet explosion was set off last year by the
introduction of NTT DoCoMo's i-mode cellular phones, which are
capable of sending and receiving data. And now competing with the
i-modes are an increasingly popular type of cellular phone known as
PHS that supports data speeds of 64,000 bits a second _ as fast as
the wired, ISDN digital phone lines here.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Japan is now moving quickly to a second generation
of wireless Internet technology, which promises higher data speeds
and a variety of location-sensing commercial services that are
likely to be embraced by business customers.
</P>
<P>
   But this is far more than a business revolution. One has only to
sit in a Japanese subway car watching teen-agers communicating via
the Internet cell phones, or wander the stores of the Akihabara,
Tokyo's electronics district, where there are literally hundreds of
different voice, data and data-voice handset models on display, to
grasp the momentum of the wireless Net in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In advertisements and in interviews, Keiji Tachikawa, chief
executive and president of NTT DoCoMo, has been sketching out his
vision of a next-generation digital cellular network to be
initiated early next year, when DoCoMo plans to offer five types of
wireless Internet access devices that will further blur the line
between cell phones and computers.
</P>
<P>
   It is a prophecy that has led many observers of the Internet in
Japan to conclude that the wired world may increasingly become an
afterthought for most Internet users here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan is more mobile and less people are home,'' said Joichi
Ito, an Internet pioneer in Japan who now heads Neoteny, a
Tokyo-based Internet business incubator. ``Most people don't have
living rooms here, and wiring is very high-cost.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also other cultural factors that explain the wireless
versus wired split. Andrew Seybold, an American wireless expert who
visited here this summer to study the Japanese wireless market,
points to a variety of reasons that the wireless Internet has taken
faster, firmer root in Japan than in the United States: better
wireless coverage, pricing on a par with prices for wired service
and the fact that for many people, particularly teen-agers, the
wireless phone is their only phone.
</P>
<P>
   Seybold also noted the strong cultural factors that have driven
the success of the i-mode phone in Japan, particularly popular
``killer applications,'' like train schedules, wireless banking and
games.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese designers seem to have understood the user interface
issues in a way that American designers have not, Seybold said.
``In Japan you can get to the train schedule with two clicks,'' he
said. ``When I try to find a plane flight on a U.S. cell phone, I
have to go through seven menu levels before I can even enter the
flight number.''
</P>
<P>
   One likely consequence of the diverging approaches to the Web is
that Japan, and by extension Asia, may be reaching the next
generation of the Internet far sooner than the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that means that the next generation of technology
innovation and competitive advantage will follow the Web westward
across the Pacific Ocean remains to be seen. Meanwhile, Hiroaki
Kobayashi can only hope that Tokyo Metallic does not become
completely swamped by the wireless wave.

A SPACE DETOUR FOR STREAMING INTERNET TRAFFIC

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Listening to NetRadio.com's Woodstock 69 music channel or
KBAC-FM, Santa Fe's jazz and eclectic radio station, or some other
music program over the Internet is gaining popularity among people
who spend lots of time online. But delivering simultaneous streams
of music to thousands or even millions of listeners over an
ever-more-clogged Internet has become increasingly frustrating. If
the audio stream hits too many traffic jams, the listener may find
his Internet radio program stuttering or stopping midway through a
song.
</P>
<P>
   One promising remedy involves sending the stream up to a
satellite, hopping over most of the jam ups on the ground and
landing the music stream at a network hub closer to the listener.
</P>
<P>
   That is how Viacom's MTV Networks is helping move the feed from
SonicNet.com _ one of 18 MTV Web sites _ to the ears of its
Internet audience. SonicNet beams its audio stream to the Loral
Skynet Telstar 7 satellite from a station in Tulsa, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite feeds SonicNet's programming to antennas around
the country, converting it back to an Internet signal that is
distributed to 135 network hubs operated by America Online,
Excite(AT)Home and other Internet service providers. Those
providers then pass it along through conventional cables or
telephone lines to people at their PC's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't care if it's delivered by satellite, fiber or carrier
pigeon; we care about cost,'' said Nicholas Butterworth, president
and chief executive of the MTVi Group, MTV's Internet unit. He made
clear, though, that he was still monitoring the results. ``So far
the satellite service has proven valuable,'' Butterworth said,
``but over the long term, who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   MTVi is using competing ground-based distribution services from
companies like Akamai Technologies and Digital Island to improve
the reception of its Internet music and video programs.
</P>
<P>
   The iBeam Broadcasting Corp., which provides the satellite
service to MTVi, said it had signed up 250 Internet content
providers the last nine months, since it started operating its
network of satellites and fiber to bypass traffic jams on the
terrestrial Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment and news providers like MSNBC Cable News, another
iBeam customer, want to see their Web content delivered to users in
the fastest, most efficient way possible and are willing to pay for
such service. IBeam charges the companies monthly fees of $4,600 or
more.
</P>
<P>
   IBeam, which had a public stock offering in May, reported a loss
of $33.1 million for the second quarter on revenue of $3.4 million.
The company has several competitors that offer _ or plan to offer _
satellite service as a way for Internet content companies to rise
above the network fray.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, some overseas Internet service providers have
used satellite links as a way to connect to the United States'
Internet backbone. But the use of satellite distribution by
American Web content companies as a way to gain speed and
efficiency is still a new business, though it is an approach
similar to the way cable and broadcast TV networks have distributed
programming to cable operators and local stations for more than two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   IBeam and its rivals, including Cidera, InterPacket and NetSat
Express, contend that the Internet is a hostile network environment
for streaming media, the Internet term for video and audio that is
viewed or heard as it is transmitted, rather than being received
and stored on the user's PC before being played.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet was not designed to do what we're asking it to do
_ to distribute something that looks like TV or sounds like a CD,''
said Peter B. Desnoes, iBeam's chief executive. He notes that a
three-minute video stream requires a total data transfer of nearly
10 million bytes _ roughly 800 times more than a typical Web page.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way to solve it is to go around the Internet itself,''
Desnoes said. ``We have built a very complex private network that
includes satellite elements that sends content out to the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   The public Internet architecture is simply not designed to
handle large audiences of simultaneous users who, for example,
might tune into Internet Webcasts. Nor are the built-in backup
systems. If a few packets of data are lost in the transmission of
an e-mail message or a Web page, the Internet's software
automatically finds them and replaces them. But in the case of a
video transmission, resending packets to replace lost data can make
for a choppy picture.
</P>
<P>
   For video traveling from a single point to many, ``nothing beats
satellite,'' said Robert Fagin, Internet, infrastructure and
services analyst at Bear, Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   Bear, Stearns forecasts a $48 billion market for streaming media
by 2010, up from $1.3 billion today, with perhaps 30 percent of the
flow being delivered by third-party service providers _ whether
satellite players or companies that offer land-based route-around
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Cidera, a satellite-delivery company based in Laurel, Md.,
predicts that audience demand for streaming media will be so strong
that content providers and Internet service companies alike will be
willing to pay companies like Cidera to ensure a smooth and steady
flow of streaming media.
</P>
<P>
   Ramachandran Viswanathan, Cidera's vice president for marketing,
said Internet service providers recognized that ``streaming media
is like a tsunami wave about to break on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when people have high-speed Internet connections like the
DSL service available through telephone companies, they can find
that streaming media can be slowed or disrupted by bottlenecks on
the Internet, said Bill Collatos, a venture capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   Collatos is a founding managing general partner of Spectrum
Equity, a $3 billion firm in Boston that has invested in Orblynx
Inc. of Fairfax, Va., a company that, with the help of Intelsat,
has developed technology for distributing Internet content by
satellite.
</P>
<P>
   For the public, investment opportunities are still limited.
IBeam shares were offered at $10 in May, and reached nearly $28 in
early June, before falling back. They closed at $10.1875 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Cidera, InterPacket and NetSat Express have all registered for
public offerings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but
have not set dates for proceeding. Meanwhile, competition is on the
way from several big, established satellite companies, including
Intelsat and PanAmSat, which are putting their own Internet-content
delivery networks into service.
</P>
<P>
   IBeam appears to be ahead of the others in its service concept,
which goes beyond delivery and includes flourishes like adding
other material to the information stream. For MTVi, for example,
iBeam can insert advertising into the live streams, tailored to
individual subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a cat owner, you will get a cat commercial,''
Desnoes said. ``We provide those services.''
</P>
<P>
   The economics of the business models are still to be proved by
iBeam and the other start-ups, which lease satellite capacity
rather than operate their own spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Stanyard, the principal consultant at the British firm DTT
Consulting, has studied the use of satellites with the Internet for
more than three years. He said that the most that a company like
Cidera could expect to charge an Internet service provider was $250
a month _ a figure that he said in some cases might not cover the
cost of providing the service. ``It becomes difficult to get your
money back,'' Stanyard said.
</P>
<P>
   But Collatos, the venture capitalist, remains guardedly
optimistic about the Internet satellite companies. ``All are early
stage and they will miss their plans; it's inevitable,'' he
acknowledged. ``But fundamentally, the concept they have is
sound.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   If there were any established companies ready-made for the
Internet, they should have been the big television networks. Or at
least that was how it seemed two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have what is needed to compete because of the great depth
in our brands and the great consumer loyalty to them,'' Michael D.
Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney, said in 1998 on the eve of the
debut of Disney's Go Network.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast networks, after all, are still the most powerful
media forces in America, accounting for the two-thirds of the seven
hours of television the average household watches each day. And
they have an arsenal of advantages: lots of money, libraries of
programming and decades of experience in attracting and keeping big
audiences. And most important, the networks have the ability to
promote their Web sites with unlimited amounts of advertising on
television, which is still the most persuasive medium.
</P>
<P>
   But after great effort and hundreds of millions of dollars of
promotion, the networks are still also-rans on the Web. Traffic to
their various sites badly lags behind the big portals like Yahoo,
America Online and Microsoft's MSN, which are the closest thing the
Web has to major networks.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Wall Street has all but written off the broadcast
companies as Internet players. The publicly traded shares of NBC
Internet and ABC's online cousin, the Walt Disney Internet Group,
are down more than two-thirds this year _ a steeper decline than
those that the stocks of their larger competitors have suffered.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, NBC Internet, citing slowing ad sales, said it
would lay off 20 percent of its work force.
</P>
<P>
   CBS, meanwhile, has delayed plans to spin off its Internet
operations into a separate company. And CBS' new parent, Viacom,
has postponed the offering of shares in its online music business,
the MTVi Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now investors are not rewarding the Internet activities
of Disney, NBC and Viacom,'' said Tom Wolzien, an analyst with
Sanford C. Bernstein. ``They are small, and the market prefers the
big players like Yahoo and America Online.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a humbling comedown for the networks and their
owners, who are more accustomed to being mighty media monoliths
than niche players scrounging for audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner now says he was given bad advice about how much the
Internet differed from Disney's other businesses. The company
developed the first version of its portal, Go.com, in six months,
he noted, to keep pace with the notion of hyperfast Internet time.
</P>
<P>
   ``People told me we had to be like Microsoft and put out version
one and two and three, and eventually we would get it right,''
Eisner said. ``We did that with Go, then people told us it wasn't
as good as Yahoo or America Online. I've never been involved with
anything where I didn't believe what we did wasn't the best. But
here we were, experimenting in front of the public.''
</P>
<P>
   What went wrong?
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, the networks overestimated their own strengths.
Their vaunted promotional abilities, for example, were helpful in
persuading people to try their Web sites. But lacking the depth and
sophistication of features that the successful portals had, many of
the network sites could not turn the merely curious into steady
customers.
</P>
<P>
   And for all their early confidence, the network companies have
been uncertain whether to make their Internet operations
independent, to emulate the fast-moving style of other Web
companies, or to keep them part of their broadcast operations, to
take best advantage of their popular media content and packaging
skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mistake made over and over again by traditional media
companies is that they dabble in new media rather than doing
something strategic to integrate with their core assets,'' said Tom
Rogers, chief executive of Primedia and former head of NBC's cable
operation and much of its Internet activities.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the networks' biggest Web successes have been
the efforts most closely aligned with broadcast programming _ as
when ABC and its cable cousin ESPN promote the sports content of
ESPN.com, or when CBS newscasts cite the financial reports on CBS
MarketWatch.com. But those successes in specialized areas of
coverage stand in stark contrast to the typically more
disappointing results whenever the network companies have tried to
reach broader audiences.
</P>
<P>
   And even one unqualified hit is giving little glory to an outfit
that could use some. MSNBC.com, backed by the combined promotion of
NBC's cable network and Microsoft's MSN Internet site, has grown
rapidly to become the No. 1 news site on the Internet. MSNBC even
was profitable for NBC last year, executives say. But according to
the terms of the deal, MSNBC's audience counts toward MSN's
ratings, and the site sends little traffic to NBCi.
</P>
<P>
   The networks' experience is not simply a tale of hubris, of
media moguls glibly assuming they would show those goateed and
pierced Web kids a thing or two.
</P>
<P>
   In large measure, it was Wall Street that pushed the networks
into the game, by demanding two years ago that the network
companies mount a credible Internet strategy. So, all too gamely,
the networks plunged ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, the owner of ABC, and NBC, with the blessing of its
corporate parent, General Electric, each made a series of
acquisitions, combined with internal operations, to build Internet
portals that were meant to challenge Yahoo and America Online. For
ABC-Disney it was the Go Network, built from the Infoseek search
engine. For NBC, it was Snap, bought from Cnet.
</P>
<P>
   But the best days of both Go and Snap seem to be behind them. It
is true that Go was the Web's sixth-most-popular site in June,
according to the research firm Media Metrix. And Snap, counted
along with the other sites run by the NBC Internet unit, ranked
ninth. But on the Internet, both audience and revenue appear to be
concentrating in a handful of leaders at the very top. Indeed, over
the last year, Go and NBCi have actually lost audience share, even
as the leaders _ America Online, Yahoo and MSN _ have all increased
their shares by more than 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   CBS, meanwhile, has taken a different tack. Rather than trying
to create a network-scale portal, the company backed a dozen
independent, specialized Web services, like MarketWatch, Sportsline
and Iwon.
</P>
<P>
   Among CBS.com and sites in which Viacom-CBS have investments,
none was among the top 50 _ except Iwon.com, a site that gives cash
prizes to users, which ranked 21st.
</P>
<P>
   (CBS.Com had been losing audience share earlier this year, but
has bounced back somewhat on Web traffic related to the network's
hit show, ``Survivor.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``The networks looked at the Internet and had to do something,
if for no other reason than defensively,'' said Dean Daniels, a
former CBS executive who is now president of Theglobe.com, a
youth-oriented online community site. ``There are huge audiences
online that are spending less time watching television. The problem
is that none of the networks are getting it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner, which runs the CNN, Turner and WB networks along
with myriad other media properties, felt so flummoxed by the rise
of new media that it agreed to sell itself to America Online in
January.
</P>
<P>
   And the News Corp., which owns the Fox network and endured an
expensive Internet flop in 1997, has kept a lower profile since
then. Fox now hopes to capitalize on the rollout of high-speed, or
broadband, Internet connections that are much better suited to
disseminating video signals than are conventional telephone lines.
One example of this strategy, already available, is
toohotforfox.com, a site that offers video outtakes from the Fox
network's so-called reality programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is over, and the major media companies didn't win
it,'' said Peter Chernin, News Corp.'s president. ``We didn't win.
Disney didn't win. AOL and Yahoo did. So we're going to the next
game, which is broadband, and that's wide open.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the three big broadcast networks are reassessing
their strategies. NBCi, which recently said ad sales would fall
short of Wall Street's expectations, now plans to scrap the the
heavily promoted Snap name and more than a dozen other brands and
focus on a redesigned site under the name NBCi.com. And Disney,
recognizing the futility of going portal-to-portal with either
Yahoo or AOL and learning from the success of its own ESPN.com,
plans to focus its Web effort on entertainment and leisure
activities.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ESPN.com is the top sports site, followed by CBS Sportsline,
both of which are incessantly promoted on their networks'
sportscasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are focused on the marriage of the Internet and on-air,''
said Fred Reynolds, Viacom's chief financial officer, who held the
same position at CBS, where he looked after the Internet
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, CBS' Web strategy may be the one that is likely to
change the least. All along, the company tended to buy partial
stakes in specialized Internet sites like Sportsline in return for
broadcast advertising time rather than cash. And much of that
advertising comes not from the network's inventory of 30-second
commercials, but within the programming itself. ``Every time Dan
Rather introduces the business news from MarketWatch, we get
credit,'' Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   There are also early signs that the networks are figuring out
how to create Web sites tied to their broadcast entertainment
programming. Traffic is brisk at the sites for CBS' hit shows
``Survivor''
(www.cbs.com/network/tvshows/mini/survivor/index.shtml) and ``Big
Brother''
(http://webcenter.bigbrother2000.aol.com/entertainment/NON/), the
latter featuring video feeds of contestants 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   And ABC has developed Web programming meant for viewers to
browse while watching certain programs. Some 150,000 people compete
during each ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' broadcast, for
example, to see if they can answer the questions before the
contestant does. Not only does that site earn a profit from the
Internet ads it sells, but ABC believes it also helps build a loyal
TV audience.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, it appears that the networks are concluding that
their best bets for the Web may spring from individual programs,
rather than their entire programming portfolio. Ah, the virtues of
hindsight.
</P>
<P>
   What has been much harder has been to figure out the digital
incarnation of the networks themselves. CBS, NBC and ABC are some
of the most powerful brands in the country, but what exactly do
they stand for with ``.com'' affixed to the end?
</P>
<P>
   A major television network is, after all, an aggregation of many
types of programming _ news sports, comedy, drama and, these days,
voyeurism. So it seemed natural that the corollary of the network
in the Digital Age was the Internet portal _ a one-stop shop full
of entertainment and information, bundled with a search engine and
lots of other useful features like news and e-mail. Portals were
doubly appealing because, then as now, they get the lion's share of
the traffic and advertising revenue on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But once they waded in, the networks soon found themselves up to
their knees in a swamp of tedious portal necessities like building
business directories and creating retail transaction services that
have little to do with the media companies' expertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned I don't want to sell insurance or create a yellow
pages,'' Eisner said. After a year of struggling to beat Yahoo at
its own game, Eisner decided earlier this year to pull back from
the portal business. ``It's not us. Our company stands for travel
and entertainment and having a good time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NBC, by contrast, is still focused on building a broad portal.
But the emphasis will be on shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be all things to all people, and that was NBCi's
problem,'' said Marty Yudkovitz, president of NBC Interactive
Media.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, the only network-affiliated portal that is growing
rapidly is Viacom-CBS' Iwon.com, which has no explicit links to the
CBS network. In less than a year that site, which promises users
the chance to win as much as $10 million, has grown to a monthly
audience of 8.4 million people, according to Media Metrix.
</P>
<P>
   Now CBS is considering buying or building a broader portal to
present a unified view of its 200 local stations and its affiliated
Internet sites. But Reynolds said the company would not give up its
strict financial discipline that kept it from entering the sort of
deals its rivals did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not be a second citizen online,'' he said. ``We are
willing to invest a lot of money, but at the end of the day you
have to have a business that produces more cash than you spend.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Like many senior-level Internet executives, Christine Harmel,
chief executive of Interactive Resource, a firm in Manhattan that
matches Web site developers with clients, was present at the birth
of e-commerce. Working on the Net since 1995, Harmel, 32, has
experienced years of 80-hour workweeks and has watched the industry
transform itself from a stomping ground for young workaholics who
wanted to change the world, into a stomping ground for young
workaholics who want to change their tax brackets.
</P>
<P>
   Now she is looking to move on. Like a growing number of industry
veterans, Harmel has begun searching for a house away from the
nation's technology hotbeds _ South Carolina is her choice _ and is
planning to eventually sell her business and leave the industry.
``We're burned out,'' Harmel said, speaking of Net entrepreneurs of
a certain level of experience and fatigue. ``Some of us are tired
and rich. Some of us are tired and not rich. But we're all tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Data on this topic are scarce, but anecdotal evidence suggests
that a changing of the guard is under way in the Internet industry,
as the early proponents of the Web are stepping aside for the
mainstream business people who have migrated to the new medium.
Such a cultural shift was to be expected, given how the Web itself
has become a mainstream phenomenon. But analysts say the executive
shift could have broad implications for e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call this Web 2.0,'' said Clay Shirky, a partner at
Accelerator Group, a consulting firm that works with Web start-ups,
who has worked in the Internet industry since 1993. ``This has been
going on slowly, and now people are realizing the landscape has
changed without us having caught onto it.''
</P>
<P>
   The changing culture within Internet businesses _ from a work
force of ``young, revolutionary zealots'' to one with a more
mainstream corporate ethic _ ``is a necessary thing,'' Shirky said.
``For the Net to be genuinely revolutionary, it has to be genuinely
ordinary,'' he said. ``So it has to be normal within the business
world, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But losing the revolutionary zeal and the wisdom of the Web's
early leaders could also change the pace of innovation, Harmel and
others said, as the more managerial types replace the tinkering
pioneers. But then, in many cases, there may not be many insanely
great ideas left in the brains of the old guard, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to contribute good, new ideas and keep stuff going
if everybody's sitting at home eating Fritos, comatose from four
years of working this hard,'' Harmel said. ``Lately, when you ask
people how it's going, you constantly hear them say, `I'm tired. I
want my life back,''' Harmel continued. ``For me, it's time to
focus on what's important in life: family, food, sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet veterans who are considering a hiatus or a new career
say the hours have been brutal. But they also say the
relentlessness of their jobs was easier to accept when the focus
was on exploring the creative possibilities of technology, not
constructing a blueprint for a public company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clash of the cultures is there,'' said Mark Hurst,
president of Creative Good, a Web site consulting company in New
York. Hurst, who is 27 and started working on the Internet
immediately upon leaving MIT with a master's degree in computer
science in 1995, said he was planning a sabbatical to write a book
about what he called ``bit literacy,'' which would explore how
people can avoid being overwhelmed by Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago, things were still fresh, a little more
hopeful, less cynical than they are now,'' Hurst said. ``People who
were part of that original culture see what the game is about now,
and they're saying, `This isn't what I came here for. If you want
it so bad, you can have it. I'm going to go scuba diving.'''
</P>
<P>
   Or sailing, in the case of Catrina Gregory, who recently quit
her job as vice president for business development at UPOC.com,
which provides services to wireless Net users. After two years of
working ``insane hours'' for Web companies, Gregory, 29, is taking
several months off to learn sailing, get her pilot's license and
plan her next career move.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory's first dot-com employer, Sabela Media, was purchased by
another Web advertising firm, 24/7 Media , in January. ``So I went
from this small start-up environment to being part of a behemoth,''
she said. ``It was tough for me to get up and say, `I'm going to
make 24/7 stronger, faster, better.'''
</P>
<P>
   Saying that Sabela's sale to 24/7 Media did not make her rich,
Gregory added: ``For those of us who haven't ended up
gazillionaires, the question is, `How much longer am I willing to
put off personal happiness?' So many people have stock options that
are worthless, and without that bait, why stay with something you
don't really like doing?''
</P>
<P>
   The chances of her returning to a dot-com after the hiatus, she
said, are ``less than 50 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Heiferman, who founded i-Traffic, an online marketing
company, in 1995, and sold it to Agency.com in November, said there
was ``definitely a bit of burnout in this industry.'' Heiferman,
28, who earlier this year founded RocketBoard, a company that makes
keyboards designed for Internet use, added that he was ``concerned
about the implications of this, because an intensity and strong
sense of purpose can make miracles happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But in another sense, this is textbook stuff,'' he said. ``The
bigger any company gets, the tougher it is for dissenting voices to
come through or for innovation to happen. I think there will still
be passionate people in the industry. Maybe there will just be
fewer of them on a percentage basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Heiferman said he agreed that working conditions had been
difficult for dot-com employees over the last several years. ``But
for better or worse, there was a revolution going on, so it was no
time for people to pace themselves,'' he said. ``It was a time to
go full steam.''
</P>
<P>
   Shirky, of Accelerator Group, said some executives still wanted
to go full steam, but because of the changing nature of e-commerce,
they wanted to do it in a different industry. ``I've had a number
of conversations with people who've said, `Oh, maybe I'll go into
biotech,' as if that industry needs the same energy and input as
they put into the Internet,'' Shirky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They figure that if the Internet isn't where the revolution
and action is anymore, then the action must have just gone
somewhere else,'' he added. ``What they don't realize is that it's
just gone, period. The Internet is a once in a lifetime thing.''

 &HT;    Classical community tuning up for turn on Web's world stage
 &HT;    By Pierre Ruhe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Almost everything you read about Napster, the
embattled software program that allows users to trade music over
the Internet, concerns the vibrant, commerce-driven world of pop
music. Napster has grown into a national fad by offering free tunes
and a sense of community for a youthful, computer-savvy crowd _
underscored by the rebellious thrill of ripping off major
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the profile of the typical classical music fan.
While a smattering of pieces by Bach and Brahms, Stravinsky and
Steve Reich are available on Napster, downloaded music has thus far
had a negligible effect on classical recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Frustratingly, it takes far longer to download a piece than it
takes to hear it. With a standard 56K modem, it takes about four
minutes to download one minute of music. Thus, the system is better
equipped to grab Eminem's ``Kill You'' (4 1/2 minutes) than
Mahler's Symphony No. 2 (80 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the Internet is woefully inconvenient for listening
to classical music,'' says Bill Rosenblatt, president of
GiantSteps, a media consulting firm in New York. ``It can take more
than four hours to get Beethoven's Ninth Symphony off the Web. In
that time you could drive to a record store, buy it, come home and
listen to the whole thing. Plus, you'd have the CD on your shelf,
with pictures and liner notes.''
</P>
<P>
   So the industry is awaiting broad access to the utopia called
broadband, which promises to fly at least an order of magnitude
faster. High-speed transmission is available now, although it's
expensive and still relatively uncommon. Yet when most houses in
America are broadband connected, the experts speculate, it'll
change how all recorded music is heard.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of free music and fear of the imminent demise of the
CD has been a staggering blow to the major record companies,
including Sony, EMI, Universal and BMG _ all of which have a
classical division loaded with rich back catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, these companies' e-commerce plans seemingly
consisted of suing Napster and another dot-com, MP3, which runs a
compression program that turns music from compact discs into small,
manageable computer files that can then be virtually swapped, one
song at a time.
</P>
<P>
   An appeals court is to rule in September on whether Napster has
violated copyright law and should be shut down. Yet, even if
Napster goes under, similar services _ many of which exist in the
unregulated ether of the Web _ will keep music piracy afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Now the major labels have launched plans to collect for
downloading their product. Last week, EMI announced plans to charge
full CD prices ($16.99) per album; Universal, the world's largest
record label, will soon charge $2 per song to download. A lot of
customers might wonder why bother with an expensive toll road if
it's no quicker, no more scenic, than the service lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has created a mind-set that content is free,''
says Rosenblatt, ``and the longer this goes on, the more reluctant
people will be to pay. Only when the technology for paying becomes
transparently easy, then perhaps, maybe, people won't mind paying.
It should be as easy as making a long-distance phone call _ you
don't have to worry about the cost till later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are happy to be moral, so long as it's not
inconvenient.''
</P>
<P>
   Major players in the classical music community have been slower
to react, although administrators from orchestras around the
country have gotten together to calm their collective anxieties and
consider their options.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra is among the ensembles to have
signed on to what's touted as the Electronic Media Forum, which is
effectively a set of guidelines for each orchestra to develop a
unique path onto the Internet. The agreement was ratified in June
by the American Federation of Musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``A subscriber said to me, `Wouldn't it be nice to hear a
concert one night and order a recording of it from the Web the next
day?' '' says ASO President Allison Vulgamore. ``Yeah, that would
be great, and that's one possibility. But right now the quality
hasn't caught up with the novelty.''
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Orchestra sees the Internet, in effect, as a
marketing tool, not an end in itself. Joseph Kluger, the
orchestra's president, notes that, ``Our primary goal with
technology is to ensure the success of the live concert experience.
Hearing what we do live in the concert hall gives you goose bumps
and a level of excitement that you just can't get from
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to services like Napster, the Internet has been described
as an equal-opportunity jukebox, where garage bands and
chart-topping stars share the same access to the public. Yet would
an esteemed ensemble like the Philadelphia Orchestra, one of the
oldest and most artistically refined in the world, dilute its
cachet if listed next to some Poughkeepsie Philharmonic on an
alphabetical list? These are very real issues an orchestra would
like to resolve before it's left to the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   So Philadelphia is taking the lead, with help from Online
Entertainment Network, a site partially owned by EMI.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra will broadcast a live concert Thursday, touted as
the first pay-per-listen classical music event on the Internet. The
live netcast will cost $2. The star of the show will be violinist
Itzhak Perlman, who's one of EMI's best-selling artists.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that orchestral administrators are forced to navigate
an unfamiliar field. The creative solutions they find might well
steer us into exciting and perhaps reinvigorating times for
orchestras.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most popular sites to download music without charge
are www.napster.com and www.gnutella.wego.com. To read the Internet
agreement between orchestras and musicians, go to www.icsom.org.
The Philadelphia Orchestra's Web site is www .philorch.org.

   ``ROLLING STONE''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Horton takes a gander at George W. Bush's environmental
record as Texas governor; Wil S. Hylton profiles Hugh Hefner (an
assignment that - surprise - requires extensive research at Playboy
mansion parties); Barry Walters surveys a slew of Beach Boys
reissues; and Chris Heath examines the Tao of Keanu, which is
-surprise again - way heavy. At one point, Heath asks the shirtless
cover-boy actor/bassist a vague question about wanting to direct.
``He lets out a kind of quiet sigh,'' Heath writes. ``At its worst,
it's like this. You ask Keanu Reeves a question and {hellip} just
wait. Out in space, planets collide, stars go supernova. On Earth,
forests fall, animals screech and roar. People shout and rant and
weep with anger and joy and just for the hell of it. And, all this
time, Reeves sits there, entirely silent.'' For 72 seconds. Then
comes the answer: ``No, not really.''
</P>
<P>
   ``AMERICAN DEMOGRAPHICS''
</P>
<P>
   The cover story examines the marketing competition for the
adventure-travel crowd, a demographic growing wider and deeper and
more sore by the second. Cash-heavy seniors are indulging in the
boonie-based perspiration arts as are footloose boomers and their
skateboard-toting kids. Sales of recreational gear and togs now
reportedly top $80 billion. Two-thirds of all Americans wear or use
such goods at least once a month, up from 50 percent just six years
ago, the magazine says. (Presumably freeing up a lot of room in
bowling alleys, perhaps a fine topic for an upcoming report.) The
second feature looks at domestic migration trends among the
rootless-professional class, concluding that consumption habits of
New Economy workers will enhance greatly the quality of life for
aficionados of quaint ethnic restaurants. (beginitalic)Opa!

   ``AIR &AMP; SPACE''
</P>
<P>
   Earthbound readers will enjoy the high-flying features about
colorful commercial paint jobs on airliners, the Northrop F-20
Tigershark and a brief history of America's pre-NASA space program.
The cover story isn't really about the goofy car-plane hybrid
pictured there but rather an overview of the aviation photography
of Ben Ross. As it turns out, an airborne Ross shot of the Convair
adorns the studio wall of writer Chad Slattery. The 1948 photo
``captured something essential about postwar America.'' Slattery
writes. ``I look at that picture today and feel the era's
confidence, its faith in technology, its extravagant and often
reckless consumerism.'' The issue's don't-miss feature, though, is
a collection of pre-World War I letters from Marine Corps pilot
Francis Evans to his lady friend, Elizabeth Kibbey, who would later
become Evans' wife. It's a lovely time-capsule look at the
open-cockpit days.
</P>
<P>
   ``BRILL'S CONTENT''

<P>
   A small box floating on the cover says, ``Skepticism is a
virtue.'' We're down with that. Other cover words reference stories
about dishy (beginitalic)New York Times (enditalic)media writer
Alex Kuczynski, a David Halberstam update of (beginitalic)The
Powers That Be (enditalic)and a detailed look at Joan Didion's
influence on a bunch of contemporary writers, including Maureen
Dowd and Anna Quindlen. In the cover story, Seth Mnookin looks at
George W. Bush's relationship with the press and concludes that the
candidate's sometimes-goofy affability is winning the affection of
at least a few members of the traveling press corps. One conclusive
pull quote sums it up best: ``Bush has neutralized the biggest
question about his candidacy, his perceived lack of intelligence,
by letting reporters see that he is a sharp enough guy when engaged
in casual conversation.'' The skeptical cover headline labels
Bush's chummy tactic ``The Charm Offensive.''

NET ACCESS RIGHT UP CONVENTION'S ALLEY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DAVID BLOOM  
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an era that celebrates technology, political conventions have
proven no more immune than any other part of society in being
impacted by the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It's just taken a little longer for the impacts to be noticed,
because the 2000 Republican and Democratic conventions are the
first to be conducted at a time when more than half of all American
households have Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 Democratic convention, for instance, only drew a
handful of Web sites, most of them add-ons to established Old Media
operations such as The New York Times and ABC News, said Luis
Vizcaino, spokesman for the Democratic National Convention
Committee. ``They usually involved one or two reporters in the back
of each room with a laptop,'' Vizcaino said.
</P>
<P>
   Not this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 2000 Democratic National Convention will be a
state-of-the-art convention suitable for the 21st century,'' said
Vizcaino. Every Democratic delegate will have his or her own Web
page, scheduling and messaging services, to keep track of events
and gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of Internet sites set up shop last week in the GOP
convention's ``Internet Alley'' portion of one of four media tents
in Philadelphia. And in the Democratic Convention's Internet Alley,
about 150 organizations are expected to set up booths, Vizcaino
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-month-old Staples Center _ already something of a
technological marvel with its two TV production studios, 12,000
built-in phone lines, fiber-optics and other infrastructure _ has
been beefed up even further since Democratic Convention organizers
took over the facility June 9, said Staples Center director of
communications Michael Roth.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands more phone lines, 300 miles of TV cable, rooms for the
wireless transmission connections for roving reporters and special
air- conditioning units to cool TV equipment have all been added,
while more than 4,000 seats are being removed and more than 40
luxury skybox suites radically renovated to accommodate each
network's broadcasting needs, Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest of Internet sites in Philadelphia were still
the Web operations for TV and cable operations such as MSNBC and
ABC News, even though both had significant separate areas elsewhere
in the media tents for their broadcast headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they wanted to send a message to the new guys,'' joked
Mike Cornfield, a George Washington University professor of
political management and director of the Democracy Online Project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm struck by the amount of original content on these sites,''
said Phil Agre, associate professor of information studies at the
University of California, Los Angeles, and operator of a major
politically-minded mailing list called the Red Rock Eater News
Service. ``You (usually) need an audience to (be able to afford to)
produce original content. Maybe they're not getting paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornfield gave the partnership of ABCNews.com, the Washington
Post and Congressional Quarterly high marks for their combined Net
coverage of the GOP proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean they had much to cover in a GOP convention so
tightly scripted that the schedule literally put aside two minutes
for a ``spontaneous demonstration'' of crowd support.
</P>
<P>
   The news-free situation was worsened for the dot-com crowd by a
Bush campaign decision to do virtually nothing that catered to the
Internet's particular needs, Cornfield said.
</P>
<P>
   During the GOP convention, a number of sites tried techie tricks
and gimmicks to attract attention, such as Insight.com, which
outfitted its reporters in Borg-like fashion, with a headset that
included a tiny eyepiece to view video, video camera, a
wrist-mounted keyboard and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Bush Campaign decision not to do much with the Net
during the convention has disappointed them at the least and may
have hurt them,'' Cornfield said. ``I'm sure they're all hoping
Gore decides to be more aggressive at the Staples Center.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because big events such as the conventions are an
opportunity for a new medium to make a splash, if everyone
cooperates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk for a candidate with online is you never know what
will happen to your message. You can't control it,'' Cornfield
said.
</P>
<P>
   Already under way, according to Agre, is an ``underground war of
e-mails,'' as partisans on both sides duke it out on
opposition-research sites such as www.bushcheney.net, the
Democrats' quickly launched spotlight on the voting records of the
GOP nominees, and www.goreline.come, the Republicans' equivalent.
</P>
<P>
   But where those sites make it clear who's behind them, Cornfield
said, other, more vicious, and perhaps less accurate, sites won't
be this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Just as so-called independent expenditure groups are expected to
finance a series of single-issue attack ads in various battleground
states independent of the two campaigns, so too can attack Web
sites be expected to crop up with innocuous-sounding groups paying
for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this intensified underground warfare going on,'' said
Agre. ``The grassroots groups such as Free Republic (a Fresno-based
conservative site at www.freerepublic.com) have already played a
huge role in these semi-, pseudo-, quasi-scandal stories that have
been kept alive. They create a sort of echo chamber.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who is not only trailing in the polls but has long
proclaimed his efforts to help fund the Internet in its early
years, is probably more likely to go Net in a big way at his
convention and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's apparently behind, so he has to take some risks,''
Cornfield said.
</P>
<P>
   There will not only be an Internet Alley at the Los Angeles
convention, but a ``Democracy Row'' of booths will be set up in the
convention center's West Hall, located maybe 100 yards from the
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Cornfield also credited the so-called Shadow Convention with
doing a good job using the Internet to get people involved.
</P>
<P>
   The Shadow Convention, which will start at 6 p.m. today at
Patriotic Hall several blocks south of the Staples Center, is
focused on three issues, said organizer and columnist Arianna
Huffington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poverty in a time of prosperity,'' the failings of the drug
war, and the corrosive effect of money on the political process,
Huffington said.
</P>
<P>
   Former presidential contender John McCain gave a rousing speech
at the Philadelphia convention on money in politics; Russ Feingold
of Wisconsin, will speak in the Los Angeles version, Huffington
said. Other speakers include rapper Chuck D, U.S. Sen. Paul
Wellstone of Minnesota and ``Politically Incorrect'' host Bill
Maher.
</P>
<P>
   Their speeches and other work can be seen at
www.shadowconventions.com, Huffington said.

 &HT;    Old photographer ready to go digital
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The big thing for home computer users now is digital
imaging, which is a fancy way of saying home photographs and
movies.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, high on my wish list these days is a decent digital
camera. A still camera would be nice; a video camera would be
doubly nice so long as stills could be made from its output, and
generally, I believe, they can.
</P>
<P>
   With a computer of fairly recent vintage and an inkjet printer
capable of 1200 dpi printing _ which can be had for under $200 _
you have all the darkroom that will ever be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Digital cameras within the financial reach of most of us are
pretty simple things compared to your average single-lens reflex.
The latter will have interchangeable lenses, allowing you to
completely manipulate the exposure and the focus. There are digital
cameras that provide all that, too, but they are in the very
serious professional range.
</P>
<P>
   Most digital cameras have, at best, a lens with a zoom range of
3X, or three times normal. They are autofocus and offer only a
general kind of exposure control.
</P>
<P>
   One of the greatest advantages of digital cameras is that most
have a little screen on which you can get a look at the picture you
just made. If it doesn't suit you, it can be dumped from memory;
you don't have to take up the camera's limited memory with unwanted
photos.
</P>
<P>
   I used to make pictures for money as a sideline. I had my own
darkroom and all that. I gave it up when color became the standard.
Printing color, at that time, was more trouble and expense than I
cared to get into. My cameras were state of the art for the time.
</P>
<P>
   Now I would be delighted with a simple digital camera that
offered close to 2 megapixels of resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Two megapixels, according to the experts, separates the men from
the boys in terms of image quality. With 2 megapixels, you can make
nice 8x10 prints. Under that you had best stick with 5x7 images. I
could go with 5x7. The lower resolution is quite sufficient for
putting pictures on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   You can, however, make lovely prints with an inkjet printer and
the right paper. I've just finished testing some paper from a firm
called AGA Chemicals, which markets the stuff under the Pictorico
label.
</P>
<P>
   Using a stock picture in Adobe Photosuite LE, I ran three kinds
of paper through my LexMark 5700: Photo Gallery Hi-Gloss White
film, Premium Photo Glossy Paper and Premium Canvas.
</P>
<P>
   The results were spectacular. It's hard for me to see a lot of
difference between the Photo Gallery stock, which is terribly dear
at $75 for 40 sheets, and the Premium Photo, at a very reasonable
$12 for 20 sheets. Both presented a brilliant image.
</P>
<P>
   The canvas paper is a very heavy stock, with a strong canvaslike
texture, and it lent an entirely different feel to the photo. You
wouldn't use it often at 10 sheets for $22, but it would be grand
for certain painterly images.
</P>
<P>
   All those prices, incidentally, are for 8x10 sheets. You can get
more information, and order paper if you can't find it locally,
from www.pictorico.com.

 &HT;    `Pac-Man,' other classics basking in 3-D updates
 &HT;    By Troy Oxford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Classic video games like ``Pong,'' ``Frogger'' and
``Pac-Man'' still evoke a bit of nostalgia in me. These are the
games I grew up with. These are the games that spawned my love of
video games today.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has advanced a lot, however, and many video games
today make those vintage games look like cave paintings by
comparison. Game characters that were once simple, two-dimensional
representations have evolved into highly detailed, 3-D models.
</P>
<P>
   Game developers still lovingly embrace the spirit of those
arcade classics, however, and have united early titles with current
gaming technology to produce a beautiful marriage of nostalgia and
modernism.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro Interactive is one of the enthusiastic developers
producing some of the new classics. A simple game like ``Pong'' has
been fleshed out considerably. What once was an amusement
consisting of two flat sticks and a blip for a ball is now a
multilevel 3-D game with more than 20 scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   Following the same scheme, Hasbro Interactive will add
``Breakout'' and ``Galaga'' to its new-classics roster next month.
Other notable Hasbro titles are favorites such as ``Frogger,''
``Missile Command,'' ``Centipede'' and ``Q-Bert.''
</P>
<P>
   One arcade veteran, Midway, has given the classic game
``Rampage'' a new face. The original arcade game put up to three
players in command of a trio of city-crushing creatures. The object
was simply to smash away and demolish buildings while avoiding army
units and pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Midway's new ``Rampage Through Time'' expands on the premise and
presentation. Now sporting twice as many monsters to choose from,
various minigames and city locations from throughout history,
Midway has given a classic new life.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best resurrections is ``Pac-Man World'' by Namco. If
there is one game that represents the classics, it would have to be
``Pac-Man.'' The little chomping hero recently celebrated his 20th
anniversary, and Namco has honored him appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   The basic elements are still there: mazes, power pellets and, of
course, the ghost pests Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Clyde. This time
around, however, Pac-Man's world is in 3-D, and he faces new
challenges and enemies in imaginative locations.
</P>
<P>
   Beautiful, stylized graphics, new game play and multiple game
modes enhance the classic title tenfold. There is even an original
version included in case you want to relive the good ol' days.

 &HT;    Flash Player brightens Web sites
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   What is Macromedia Flash 4? Will it affect other programs? Is it
a program that you can install but never remove? I am requested to
download it before using some educational materials.
</P>
<P>
   _ R.H. Downing
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Sounds like you're talking about the free viewer called
Macromedia Flash Player. Through your browser, it lets you
experience animation and entertainment that designers weave into
Web sites. Fun buttons. Movies. Flying logos. Graphics. You name
it.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: We're talking Web sites with sizzling content, such as
cartoons, interactive interfaces, online tutorials and information
graphics that were created using the ``Big Daddy'' program,
Macromedia Flash. Unlike the player, it isn't a freebie (Cost: $250
to $280). The software is part of Macromedia's graphics, Web
authoring and integration tools. A new release, Flash 5, is due out
in September.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Like its name, it has ``flash.'' The operative word is
``animation.'' Web designers use the animation tool to dazzle,
adding sounds, interactivity, the whole shebang, to create a
high-impact, low-bandwidth Web experience.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Low bandwidth is a good thing. Flash-based files are
smaller in size and can be viewed fast and efficiently. A mega-huge
data pipeline isn't required, and you don't wait all day for
animation or graphics to do their thing.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Let's get back to Flash Player. It's a browser plug-in
available for Mac and PC, and we haven't seen any ill effects on
other programs. The player is tiny and takes a short time to
download, which you can do when a Web site tells you that you need
it or go to cnet.com/downloads/ or macromedia.com/software/.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Flash Player works hand-in-hand with another free
plug-in, Shockwave Player, the king of multimedia playback. Add
that to your download list, too. What's cool, if you download
Shockwave first, Flash Player will tag along. Other fun Internet
players also can be found at CNET. Get RealPlayer Basic to enjoy
streaming audio and video. Mac users can find the Quicktime
plug-in, too. It's Apple's video technology that allows you to play
high-quality video directly on your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: The plug-ins don't have to become permanent residents on
your computer. You can evict them. Once you see how they enrich
your Web visits, I bet you let 'em stay.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Explore how companies such as K-Swiss, North Face,
Sprint, Nike, Disney, Macy's, etc., used the ``Big Daddy'' Flash to
add pizzazz to their Web sites. The Air Force is a Flash fan, too.
Surf to macromedia.com/showcase/ and click the Flash link.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Without Flash Player, you'd miss seeing the shimmer of
those sites.
</P>

Journal-Constitution. E-mail questions to techsavvy(at)ajc.com.

 &HT;    Yahoo strikes a blow for free music
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Music lovers _ not to mention the lawyers and rock
groups who want to sue them _ will be intrigued by Yahoo's new
category listing: ``Digital Distribution.'' They'll especially love
the subcategory: ``Peer to Peer File Sharing.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``peer to peer file sharing'' has a nice ring to it,
but essentially it's a high-class way of saying: ``Hey, everybody!
Here's a list of places where you can swap music online for free.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo has a long and fairly comprehensive list of illegal places
to download music. It's a wonder the Recording Industry Association
of America hasn't filed suit against it for aiding and abetting
music-loving lawbreakers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the infamous places to download music is Napster
(www.napster.com), an entirely free service with literally
thousands of songs available, and every single download is free.
</P>
<P>
   As the RIAA has been saying for some time, and as we all know by
now, downloading the kind of music you'll find on Internet sites
such as Napster and several others is illegal. It violates
copyright laws and all of the fair-use statutes _ and that's just
for starters.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Peer to Peer File Sharing'' category lists 25 Web sites
where users can exchange music for free. One site, MyNapster
(www.mynapster.com/faq.php), is no relation to the infamous Napster
site, but its ``frequently asked questions'' area goes into detail
about how various file-sharing Web sites are built and how the
process of sharing your favorite tunes actually works.
</P>
<P>
   From Napster to relatively new schemes like Riffage and
MojoNation, the Yahoo list is revolutionary. It's not unlike when
Harold Ross, founding editor of The New Yorker magazine, printed a
weekly list of speakeasies in the ``Talk of the Town'' section
during Prohibition. Sure, it's illegal, but it's not going to go
away. As one of the panelists at Jupiter Communications' digital
music conference said, ``20 million pirates can't be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind business-to-business or business-to-consumer or even
business-to-employee. This stuff is free. No money changes hands.
None. Zero. Nada. We've got ourselves a whole new category here,
``P-to-P'' _ no, not profits to profitability, that's P2P for those
of you keeping score at home _ but peer-to-peer. Yahoo knows people
are searching for these sites, as do other search engines.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of July, things weren't looking too good for
Napster, the most popular of these P-to-P sites. A lawsuit from the
RIAA could have shut it down permanently. But the lawsuit backfired
in the worst way possible for the labels. Users flocked to Napster
in record numbers, according to Web measurement service Nielsen
NetRatings.
</P>
<P>
   Napster saw a 92 percent increase in traffic. Eight hundred
thousand and forty nine music lovers all were swapping music for
free shortly after the ruling. Business _ if you can call it
business; there's no profit-taking after all _ at Napster has never
been better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increase in the downloads of Napster on the heels of the
court stay is a strong indication that digital downloading has hit
critical mass among American Web consumers,'' said Allen Weiner,
vice president of analytical services at NetRatings. ``Rather than
fight this evolution, the entertainment industry should embrace it
and develop sensible solutions to capitalize on this market
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's not going to happen anytime soon. The major labels
are so obsessed with stopping Napster and other music download
sites that they can't or won't get together to offer consumers a
better, legal way to download music.
</P>
<P>
   In the real world, these same companies don't have any problems
selling their music to stores like Tower, HMV or the Virgin
Megastores.
</P>
<P>
   All of these stores have online sites, and Virgin especially is
ready to go with a site called JamCast, (www.jamcast.com). Users
register to use the site, download a player such as RealAudio,
LiquidAudio or WinAmp, and then shop the site for a variety of
tracks to download from bands as diverse as Smashing Pumpkins to
Duran Duran.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the Virgin Jamcast site is very hip, packed with
features and fun to use (it even has a decorative ``skin'' you can
download for your RealAudio player, changing its on-screen
appearance), it doesn't have anywhere near the number of songs
Napster has. Neither JamCast nor any other legitimate digital music
site will be able to take off until they can fill their virtual
shelves with as much music as they pack into their retail stores.
The Virgin Megastores aren't called Megastores for nothing. But
JamCast's shelves are still relatively empty.
</P>
<P>
   This is why so many music fans are still going the illegal route
_ the illegal sites have what fans want. Music, music and more
music. Now Yahoo has a category to help them find music faster and
more efficiently. How much longer will the record industry continue
with its posture of righteous indignation and endless lawsuits
before it realizes that the money spent on lawyers would be better
spent working on a digital music Web site and converting all these
``digital music pirates'' into happy, downloading, paid-in-full
consumers?
</P>
<P>
   Until that glorious day comes, there's always Napster and a long
list of other sites, neatly provided to you in list form from
Yahoo.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   www.etour.com _ Do you need more than a search engine or a
newspaper's list of cool Web sites to make your Web browsing
experience more suited to your own needs. eTour, whose motto is
``Surf Without Searching,'' asks you to fill out a sizable
questionnaire and then offers sites hand-picked by scrappy human
editors to fit your preferences.
</P>
<P>
   www.send4fun.com _ Want to be the most hated person in your
office? Just use this site to mail overly cutesy, prefabricated and
ultimately useless mail in the vein of the famous ``Hamsterdance.''
There are special pages (''Thank You, Mother''), dance pages
(''Crocodile Rock'') and all-around fun pages (''Mission
Possible.'') We'd say more, if we could retrieve our bile and stop
gagging.
</P>
<P>
   www.dotcomfailures.com _ Hey dot-commers, don't get cocky. This
site is a reminder that for every eBay, there's dozens of companies
like Freewwweb.com waiting to fold. The site is a searchable
database of failing Internet company news, predictions and rumors.
</P>
<P>
   www.askOJ.com _ Oh dear. As if dot-com failures weren't
depressing enough, there is this juicy site, which promises live
chats with O.J. Simpson in which he answers questions directly from
readers. For a $7.95 fee, you can save yourself an advanced seat.
Let's hope it tanks, and soon.
</P>
<P>
   www.snapfish.com _ We've been promised a revolution in the way
we take photos for years, but maybe the revolution is in how
they're printed and viewed rather than the ``Say cheese!'' side.
Snapfish.com will send you a free mailer for your film, send you
free prints and then allow you to view the same photos online and
share them with friends. The quality leaves a little to be desired,
but the price is definitely right. (Reprints and doubles, however,
do cost extra.)

 &HT;    Common sense handy when judging technology reports
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The next time you feel silly or dumb because you don't
understand technology, just head for the library, pick up some back
issues of newspapers and magazines, and read some of the technology
stories.
</P>
<P>
   You're almost guaranteed to feel better fast. When it comes to
predicting the future of technology, experts don't get it right
either. And the reporters who write about it are as confused as the
experts.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that technology experts and reporters are stupid. It's
just that predicting technology has never worked. Maybe you
remember the famous quote from Thomas Watson, chairman of IBM, in
1943: ``I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.''
And my favorite comes from Popular Mechanics in 1949: ``Computers
in the future may weigh no more than 1.5 tons.''
</P>
<P>
   Since all of us have such foggy crystal balls when it comes to
technology forecasting, you need to be vigilant when checking out
technology news on TV or in the newspaper. A healthy amount of
skepticism isn't such a bad thing when reading any news story, so
it's a good habit to acquire.
</P>
<P>
   One way to double-check what you read is to use a little known
human power. It's not very popular but it does exist and _ without
learning yoga, taking ginko tablets or attending night classes _ it
can be developed. This mysterious power is called common sense.
</P>
<P>
   Let's put it to work. Just like in the third grade, we will
start with a practice problem.
</P>
<P>
   Last week my morning newspaper told me that conventional car
radios will go away completely, replaced by fancy radios that
include Internet access. You'll also be able to talk to the car
radio to give it instructions.
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with this picture?
</P>
<P>
   Well, start with the rough estimate that only a little more than
half the U.S. population has Internet access. And only 64 percent
of the U.S. population has used the Internet at all _ even one time
counts _ over the past 12 months. So you'd have to figure that
these folks who don't use the Internet (and remember there are ways
to get access free nowadays) probably aren't going to pop for some
fancy wireless Internet radio in their cars.
</P>
<P>
   Next, remember that _ even today _ not all cars have radios
installed. My car radio has been broken for about three months and
I haven't gotten around to getting it fixed. So it's a real stretch
to think that all these folks without any radio at all, or who are
driving some beat up pickup truck with a hole where the radio used
to be, are going to switch over to Internet radios.
</P>
<P>
   The truth, as is usually the case, falls in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   These radios are coming _ have been coming for a long time _ and
almost certainly will be fairly common some day. But common sense
tells you that _ unlike what the story said _ the old regular radio
is not going to disappear any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not picking on that one story. Like I said, it's almost
certain that these newfangled radios will be common in luxury cars
and later_ as the years go by _ it'll be found in the sort of cars
that I can afford. But it's also very likely that the regular car
radio will be around for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we're using that story as a teaching point.
</P>
<P>
   Since it is unlikely that the experts and the technology writers
are going to become infallible anytime between now and Christmas,
you're going to have to shoulder some of the burden of
understanding technology. And since technology has become so
important in our daily lives, fair or not, it's a task you need to
undertake.
</P>
<P>
   So the next time you read a technology story that says a new
gadget is going to change the world by Tuesday, or that a horrible
new computer virus is going to wipe out everything from Santa Claus
to Santa Cruz, N.M., you need to run the facts through that high
tech filter called common sense.
</P>
<P>
   And, I have some important news for you. Common sense, if used
correctly, can truly change the world.

</P>
<P>
   Street Fighter EX2 Plus ($35; www.capcom.com; for the
PlayStation) is maddening! Following in the steps of Capcom's
flagship Street Fighter series, Street Fighter EX2 Plus pulls you
into the fiercest brawls against some of the baddest characters on
the videogame block. Menacing fighters with moves like the Psycho
Crusher, the Atomic Suplex and the Death Press wreak mental anguish
and virtual pain on your character, forcing you to open up your own
little can of whip-butt. But no matter how many blows you land,
nine times out of 10 you're gonna lose when you play against the
PlayStation fighters. With its vivid 3-D graphics, rapid, smooth
animation and those nauseating grunts, groans and yelps so germane
to these types of fighting games, Street Fighter EX2 Plus will keep
you and your thumbs busy _ at least until you're too frustrated to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Who Wants to be a Millionaire 2nd Edition ($40; www.playstation
.com; for the PlayStation) tries to emulate the essence of
Philbin's game show phenomenon by adding a dramatic pregnant pause
every time you select your multiple choice answer. This is
aggravating in a PlayStation game where we suffer enough loading
delays as it is. Ironically, that's the best this game has to
offer. It's trivia with Regis Philbin doing some voice work _ and
most of that is just sampled from the actual show. Other than that,
there's almost nothing here remotely resembling a video game: The
graphic interface is sparse and cheap (you stare, alternately, at
two empty chairs, or text, or an empty set mock up). And the
capper: Questions must be answered within an allotted time frame;
unlike the show, contestants are not allowed to reminisce about the
7th grade school teacher who taught extensively on the subject; no
hemming and hawing, no repartee with the host. The nerve! Give me a
time limit and then preprogram a pregnant pause before telling me
if my rushed answer is right or wrong? Lame. Who thinks it's
possible to be a millionaire by starting out $40 in the hole and
that much further away from being a millionaire with nothing to
show for it except for ``branded consumer who doesn't deserve to be
a millionaire'' emblazoned on their forehead?
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   It's tempting to say that the problem with Doom designer John
Romero's highly anticipated Daikatana ($40; www.daikatana.com; for
Windows) is that because it came along far later than promised,
truly great shooters like Unreal: Tournament and Half-Life arrived
in the meantime to leave it in the dust. And that's true. But the
real cruncher is that, though it bulges with visual flourishes and
mildly interesting weapons and monsters, the gameplay itself lies
along a spectrum from annoying to tiresome. It simply isn't much
fun. With ``save gems'' that must be tediously collected prior to
ending a session, maddeningly frustrating (but much-touted and
politically incorrect) sidekicks, laughable cinematics and
half-hearted (but seemingly endless) level designs, this story of
time-travel and swordplay offers little sparkle and no spark,
arriving stillborn after the long, long wait. Vampire: The
Masquerade _ Redemption ($45, www.activision.com; for Windows)
drops you into an immersive 3-D world where role-playing, action
and puzzle-solving are well balanced. That's the good news.
Creeping about in the shadows as the undead anti-hero Christof and
hacking away at one's enemies or drinking the blood of one's
victims iss are lovely and the characters who join your party are
interesting and even helpful. But the most highly anticipated
aspect of the game, storyteller mode, in which one player builds
and controls a world as the game is running, disappoints in that it
requires a sure hand at the helm _ something difficult to find in
the twitchfest of the Internet _ and generally degenerates into a
free-for-all. But given the right circumstances _ a well-built LAN
game with all the players physically in a room together _ Vampire
has the potential for transcending even its worst glitches.

&HT;     WELCOME TO THE L.A. POLICE STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The anarchists were coming. The cops were ready.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been a movie. More than 200 California Highway
Patrol officers in riot gear were deployed Tuesday around the
Ronald Reagan State Building, while an equal number of officers
waited inside. A helicopter hovered overhead and officers stood
ready with tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   CHP Commissioner Spike Hellman strode behind his cops, bucking
them up with pats and shouts like a Marine sergeant waiting with
his unit for the enemy to charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have learned that there is a very small group within the
larger group who may destroy property or attack officers,'' CHP
Assistant Chief Stan Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   Then we heard the dreaded anarchists coming, with their fearsome
drums and chants. There were about 200 young people and a few
gray-hairs, including state Sen. Tom Hayden, marching behind a
``Justice for Youth'' banner and a flatbed truck carrying a mobile
guerrilla theater. They carried an effigy of California Gov. Gray
Davis that looked much too lively.
</P>
<P>
   The marchers were outnumbered 2-to-1 by the cops _ 4-to-1 if you
go by body weight.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the marchers went silent as they walked by the cops.
Silence is amazingly dramatic. Politicians should try it.
</P>
<P>
   These well-organized anarchists stopped in front of the state
building and started swaying and chanting to a salsa beat. Protest
music has gotten better since Joan Baez.
</P>
<P>
   Then they surrounded themselves with their own yellow police
tape and sat down in the street to watch El Teatro Campesino's show
about corporations and ``Gov. Gravy Davis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very well-disciplined,'' said Perez said. ``So long as
they protest in a nonviolent manner, we'll work with event
organizers.''
</P>
<P>
   Plasterers working on the building across the street came out to
see what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dial 911,'' said one. ``There aren't enough cops.''
</P>
<P>
   The march was a protest against the Draconian treatment of kids
caught in the justice system, but it included people interested in
many problems they link to corporate power _ the kind shown with
every fund-raiser this convention week.
</P>
<P>
   These kids with nose rings respect unions, unlike the kids with
bell-bottoms in the '60s. San Francisco State philosophy student
Thorn Coyle described her heroes as ``all those people who died for
the 40-hour week, so now people can work 80 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyle was marching with an elementary school teacher from
Berkeley named Fern, no last name, thank you. Befitting their
names, Thorn and Fern described themselves as anarchist witches.
They merrily skipped out of the march to give bumper stickers to
wary office workers.
</P>
<P>
   The stickers read, ``Wake up, muggles! Conjure justice! Banish
corporate rule!''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody loves Harry Potter, and knows muggles are
unimaginative non-witch humans. Every time Fern or Thorn gave a
sticker to a bystander, he or she lit up in a smile.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party brought its convention to a town that looks
about as democratic as Chile in the bad old days. As Hayden put it,
``They declared martial law to allow people to protest.''
</P>
<P>
   It's very scary here, and not because of some nasty-looking kids
with spiky hair and black clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown L.A. looks like it was captured by thousands of
Robocops. The sirens and helicopters never stop. Give the
demonstrators credit. They came to talk about injustice, and Los
Angeles showed us what a police state looks, feels and sounds like.
</P>
<P>
   Before Monday night's melee outside the convention center, I
rode a Metro train with a squad of LAPD. They were spoiling for
action. One said he wanted to get ``pro-active.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a fancy way of saying kick some butt.
</P>
<P>
   Thorn was trying to relax some of the hundreds of cops along the
march route. She said to me, ``You know, if you smile at people, it
really changes things.''
</P>
<P>
   She sprayed scented water at them, too _ from far enough away
the cops wouldn't think it was pepper spray. The scene reminded me
of that 1967 photo of a protester putting a flower in the barrel of
a soldier's gun at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Fern and Thorn complained that the demonstrators have been
trivialized and demonized.
</P>
<P>
   If you want something trivial, just look at the convention. If
you want something to fear, try getting trapped between squads of
LAPD.

&HT;     O.J. SIMPSON SEEKS TO BLOCK TV MINISERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ O.J. Simpson wants to stop an upcoming
television miniseries about the defense in his murder case, saying
its purported revelations are the product of a lawyer's breach of
legal confidentiality and an author's breach of promise.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson filed suit Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court against
his former friend and lawyer, Robert Kardashian, and author
Lawrence Schiller, whose 1996 book ``American Tragedy: The
Uncensored Story of the Simpson Defense'' is the basis of the
series now being filmed for CBS Television for airing in November.
Both men denied the wrongdoing alleged by Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   Judge David Yaffe declined to issue a restraining order that
would have immediately barred Schiller from working on the
miniseries, but scheduled a hearing Sept. 6 on a request for a
preliminary injunction that would accomplish the same purpose. The
suit also seeks return of any profits Schiller and Kardashian made
by violating Simpson's rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``This action is about the avaricious disregard of the
attorney-client relationship, and of promises of confidentiality,
by an attorney and a writer who value the fame and fortune to be
derived from publishing information about a sensational trial more
than adhering to their ethical obligations and contractual
agreements,'' Terry Gross, a lawyer representing Simpson, said in
court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Gross alleged that Schiller had gained the cooperation of
Simpson and eight of his lawyers for the book project by promising,
falsely, that Simpson would be allowed to review the manuscript
before publication and remove any confidential material.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also accused Kardashian, a member of Simpson's
defense team, of divulging conversations and defense secrets to
Schiller in violation of a lawyer's legal duty to keep confidential
all information learned during the attorney-client relationship.
Schiller, who wrote the book with journalist James Willwerth,
initially described Kardashian as co-author and wound up paying him
a fee, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   The State Bar last month said it had privately reprimanded
Kardashian for professional misconduct and ordered him, with his
agreement, not to practice law for two years. The disciplinary
action was in response to Simpson's allegations, his lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   In reply to the lawsuit, Schiller and Kardashian denied making
any promises to Simpson about the book or miniseries and also said
Simpson should have sued before the book was published in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gross said Simpson had not sued then because he was tied up in a
civil damage suit. Gross also said the miniseries had large amounts
of confidential information that was not in the book. Schiller, who
is directing the TV production, said the content was virtually the
same.
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles jury acquitted Simpson in 1995 of murdering his
ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman. A
civil jury in Orange County, however, later found the former
football star responsible for their deaths in a suit by the
victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   One of the last scenes of Schiller's book portrays Kardashian,
Simpson's longtime friend, as doubting his innocence, despite the
acquittal.

<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria _ Whether they know it or not, when Westerners
try to conjure an image of fine Arab culture, it's probably close
to the courtyards and covered market streets of Syria's capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we go into the city,'' wrote travel writer Henry
Van Dyke, ``we step into a chapter of the 'Arabian Nights'
Entertainments.''
</P>
<P>
   That observation was made in 1908, but it still fits a city that
manages, amid its modernity, to stay alive with elegant detail.
</P>
<P>
   Cats slumber across finely carved tables with inlaid
mother-of-pearl oyster shell. Thick vines dangle over the walls of
the Old City. Diners smoke water pipes and sip tea in tile-lined
courtyards around quiet fountains. Swordmakers discuss their
ancient craft even as they consider advertising on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As Syria slowly opens to the west, a small but growing number of
Americans are getting to know the exotic city of about 3 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   Damascus prides itself as the oldest capital in the world _
going back at least 5,000 years _ and as a showcase of Arab
tradition. It shows itself off with sometimes grand, and sometimes
funky flourishes. For the former, there's the stately tomb of
Saladin (pronounced, ``sala-DEEN''), probably the most heroic,
non-religious, Muslim figure in all history.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's the army museum, where the power might go out as
you wander between the run-down artillery, tanks, rifles and the
dusty exhibit on Syrian Hamad Feris, who joined Soviet cosmonauts
in space. One of the few English signs at the exit states, with no
apparent irony, ``Tanks(CQ) for your visit.''
</P>
<P>
   For travelers, Syria is largely crime free. Arabic is the common
language and many Syrians also speak French. There are few
proficient English speakers, but some taxi drivers or hotel staff
will know a few words.
</P>
<P>
   Americans need to get a Syrian visa before departing. Those can
be obtained in about a week from Syrian embassies or consulates.
Syria still does not recognize Israel and will not grant visas to
people with Israeli stamps in their passports.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian countryside is flush with archeological digs and
dozens of Crusader and Muslim castles. But the capital offers a
sampling of the great mix of cultures to come through this corner
of the Mediterranean. It's also a shopping wonder, offering rugs,
furniture and metal work from around the Middle East and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   A good place to start is the walled Old City. It's a large,
working district where Syrians shop for everything from clothes to
dehydrated Newts. Sold in jars in the medicinal herb stalls, a
paste of the little lizards is supposed to cure ills and provide
sexual vigor.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to other exotic venues where the locals serve the
tourists, in Damascus' Old City, the relatively few tourists and
locals line up together at the prime spots.
</P>
<P>
   That can be at Bakdash, a crowded ice cream parlor. It sells a
delicious firm ice cream that, for some reason, requires loud
pounding by fit men with wooden hammers.
</P>
<P>
   Or, it can be at the mausoleum of Saladin. He was the Muslim
general who ruled over most of the Arab world Baibars (pronounced,
``BAY-bears''). He was the Mamluke ruler who, before his death in
1277, defeated the Mongols and almost finished off the Crusaders
who had hung on after Saladin. He was violent and unforgiving, but
his tomb is decorated with the palaces and lush plants awaiting him
in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the Old City is the Omayyad Mosque, a huge
courtyard bordered by a large prayer hall built around 708 A.D.
Inside and out are mosaics of glass beads from as far back as the
12th Century.

   PALMYRA, Syria _ This was a working city, made rich from the
caravans that passed through and paid taxes on each goatskin of
oriental perfume and every camel-load of foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
   It's more than 1,700 years past its prime. But Palmyra was once
the bustling home to 350,000 people. Water pipes of hollowed-out
stones still line the streets and an inscription urges locals to be
helpful to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   It's an ancient example of the importance of location. Palmyra
was on the Silk Road between the Orient and the Mediterranean and
near a source of water, which travelers would pay for dearly.
</P>
<P>
   When its main competitor, the Nabataean(CQ) trading city of
Petra in what is now Jordan, fell to the Romans in the Second
Century, Palmyra blossomed. It reached its peak in the Third
Century, gaining freedom from taxation by the Roman rulers.
</P>
<P>
   But the city would decline starting 272 A.D. Zenobia, the shrewd
Arab queen who claimed her lineage from Egypt's Cleopatra, tried to
gain independence. Instead, Roman armies crushed her rebellion and
took her prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient city stands in the desert about a three-hour drive
northeast from Damascus. Among the sites on the way is a
Palestinian refugee camp (more than 370,00 refugees live in Syria).
Eventually, the road is lined by the modern pipeline bringing oil
to the Mediterranean from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   About 35,000 people live in the new town of Palmyra next to the
ruins. There are several hotels. The ruins can be seen in a hurried
day. But, it's better to take two days for wandering through the
amphitheater, temples, public market and caravan stopping post,
museum and residential homes. The ruins are said to be magnificent
at dawn and dusk.
</P>
<P>
   Palmyra still possesses huge walls and spectacular colonnades
that stand out with a ghost-like presence in the dusty, hilly
desert.
</P>
<P>
   Palmyra is a Roman name, meaning city of palms. In Arabic, it is
Tadmor, meaning city of dates. Date palms abound.
</P>
<P>
   Intricate relief statues illustrate the city's people and gods.
</P>
<P>
   Near the Temple of Bel, the Babylonian god of the sky, one stone
panel shows women covered in swirls of cloth, a sign that veiling
took place even before Muslim times. Other panels show soldiers in
their armor and with their camels.
</P>
<P>
   Started in 32 A.D., the temple took 200 years to build. That's
longer than modern construction jobs but, then, most of the
structure has lasted nearly 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the building, still with its massive walls and many of
the surrounding columns, reliefs carved on the ceiling of an altar
show Bel surrounded by other gods and the signs of the Zodiac.
</P>
<P>
   The best look at the people of Palmyra _ a mix of Arab and Greek
bloodlines _ comes from their tombs on the edge of town. The
wealthy were entombed in towers, the poor in underground crypts.
</P>
<P>
   At the front of each tomb, lined with shelves where bodies were
laid on top of each other, were relief portraits of the people
inside. Those reliefs are in the Palmyra museum.
</P>
<P>
   The portraits are individual enough to make you feel like you're
meeting the inhabitants of the ancient city. Wealthy merchants are
portrayed with big bellies, a sign of prosperity. Some men have
curly hair, others straight. Women are shown holding their veils
slightly to the side to show their faces.
</P>
<P>
   About 480 feet above the desert floor, on a mountaintop, is the
12th Century Muslim Qala'at Ibn Ma'an castle. The castle,
surrounded by a moat and guard towers, provides a sweeping view of
the tombs, ancient Palmyra and the new city next door.

<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria _ Whether they know it or not, when Westerners
try to conjure an image of fine Arab culture, it's probably close
to the courtyards and covered market streets of Syria's capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we go into the city,'' wrote travel writer Henry
Van Dyke, ``we step into a chapter of the 'Arabian Nights'
Entertainments.''
</P>
<P>
   That observation was made in 1908, but it still fits a city that
manages, amid its modernity, to stay alive with elegant detail.
</P>
<P>
   Cats slumber across finely carved tables with inlaid
mother-of-pearl oyster shell. Thick vines dangle over the walls of
the Old City. Diners smoke water pipes and sip tea in tile-lined
courtyards around quiet fountains. Swordmakers discuss their
ancient craft even as they consider advertising on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As Syria slowly opens to the west, a small but growing number of
Americans are getting to know the exotic city of about 3 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   Damascus prides itself as the oldest capital in the world _
going back at least 5,000 years _ and as a showcase of Arab
tradition. It shows itself off with sometimes grand, and sometimes
funky flourishes. For the former, there's the stately tomb of
Saladin (pronounced, ``sala-DEEN''), probably the most heroic,
non-religious, Muslim figure in all history.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's the army museum, where the power might go out as
you wander between the run-down artillery, tanks, rifles and the
dusty exhibit on Syrian Hamad Feris, who joined Soviet cosmonauts
in space. One of the few English signs at the exit states, with no
apparent irony, ``Tanks(CQ) for your visit.''
</P>
<P>
   For travelers, Syria is largely crime free. Arabic is the common
language and many Syrians also speak French. There are few
proficient English speakers, but some taxi drivers or hotel staff
will know a few words.
</P>
<P>
   Americans need to get a Syrian visa before departing. Those can
be obtained in about a week from Syrian embassies or consulates.
Syria still does not recognize Israel and will not grant visas to
people with Israeli stamps in their passports.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian countryside is flush with archeological digs and
dozens of Crusader and Muslim castles. But the capital offers a
sampling of the great mix of cultures to come through this corner
of the Mediterranean. It's also a shopping wonder, offering rugs,
furniture and metal work from around the Middle East and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   A good place to start is the walled Old City. It's a large,
working district where Syrians shop for everything from clothes to
dehydrated Newts. Sold in jars in the medicinal herb stalls, a
paste of the little lizards is supposed to cure ills and provide
sexual vigor.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to other exotic venues where the locals serve the
tourists, in Damascus' Old City, the relatively few tourists and
locals line up together at the prime spots.
</P>
<P>
   That can be at Bakdash, a crowded ice cream parlor. It sells a
delicious firm ice cream that, for some reason, requires loud
pounding by fit men with wooden hammers.
</P>
<P>
   Or, it can be at the mausoleum of Saladin. He was the Muslim
general who ruled over most of the Arab world and drove the
European Crusaders out of Jerusalem. While his Crusader opponent,
England's Richard the Lion-Hearted, was known for brutality,
Saladin was honorable.
</P>
<P>
   He died in 1192 in Damascus. Though he is a hero of the Arabs,
he was an ethnic Kurd. You can still find Kurds _ who are mostly in
Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria _ visiting the tomb today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the leader who conquered places taken by the
foreigners,'' said Kurd Ali Mohammed, 21, a laborer in Damascus.
``He was very powerful, but he was also very merciful.''
</P>
<P>
   There are actually two tombs. A faded box of carved,
walnut-colored wood appears to be the original. In 1899, Germany's
Kaiser Wilhelm II added a marble tomb beside it, in honor of
Saladin.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of streets away is the mausoleum of another central
figure in Middle Eastern history, Sultan Baibars (pronounced,
``BAY-bears''). He was the Mamluke ruler who, before his death in
1277, defeated the Mongols and almost finished off the Crusaders
who had hung on after Saladin. He was violent and unforgiving, but
his tomb is decorated with the palaces and lush plants awaiting him
in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the Old City is the Omayyad Mosque, a huge
courtyard bordered by a large prayer hall built around 708 A.D.
Inside and out are mosaics of glass beads from as far back as the
12th Century.
</P>
<P>
   The mingling between Islam and Christianity is apparent. The
mosque's minaret towers include the Jesus tower, where locals
believe he will return on judgment day. Inside the mosque is a
shrine to John the Baptist, revered and called Yahia by Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the mosque should remove their shoes, but keep their
arms and legs covered or borrow the robes offered at the ticket
office.
</P>
<P>
   The Old City also offers a Christian landmark. The underground
Chapel of Ananias is named after a disciple of Jesus who is
believed to have lived there. Ananias was ordered, according to the
New Testament, to go to ``the street which is called Straight'' to
heal a blind man. The Street Called Straight is still a main road
through the Old City.
</P>
<P>
   After sightseeing, tourists can join the genteel Arab elite in
Old City restaurants built around what used to be private palaces.
The Elizer and Arabesque restaurants are two fine examples where
you can dine on lamb kabobs and traditional yogurt stews.
</P>
<P>
   When you have enough of the living history in the Old City, you
can see Syria's ancient history in the National Museum. Most
explanations are in Arabic and French, but the museum is excellent.
Most interesting are the expressive, big-eyed statuettes carved by
the Canaanites, the pagan people who populated the region in 3000
B.C.
</P>
<P>
   There are also haunting relief statues from the Second Century
Roman period. Each depicts in personal detail men and women who had
been entombed behind them.
</P>
<P>
   The museum also contains a synagogue transported from Dura
Europus, near the Syrian-Iraqi border. Though nearly 1,800 years
old, the synagogue still holds colorful painted scenes from the
bible that brighten the small sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Museum visitors might want to stop and dash off some postcards
in the museum's tranquil archeological garden. Here, under trees
that quiet the city bustle outside the walls, you can stroll amid
detailed relief sculptures and statues that form the foundations of
today's Damascus.

 &HT;    Pull together a scrumptious summer salad
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Summer is salad season. When heat and humidity put a crimp on
appetites and you don't want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen,
a main-dish salad is a healthful, tasty and creative way to get
dinner on the table.
</P>
<P>
   With supermarkets and roadside stands overflowing with wonderful
fresh produce, summer is also the time to take a breather from the
iceberg lettuce, tomato and cucumber drenched in bottled dressing.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you think your pantry pickings are spare, chances are
that if you look behind this and under that, you will find the
makings of a knockout summer salad.
</P>
<P>
   Do you have rice? Some kind of pasta? A potato or some lentils?
Surely your cupboard will yield cans of beans, corn, diced
tomatoes, salmon or tuna.
</P>
<P>
   Now check your freezer. Is it possible you have a couple of
sausages wrapped up in there or _ joy of joys _ maybe some frozen
shrimp?
</P>
<P>
   Now the fridge. Is there a bell pepper, a zucchini, a carrot or
squash hidden in the vegetable bin? Any packages of cheese lying
around?
</P>
<P>
   If you have any of these ingredients, just add a little
creativity and you are on your way to a tasty, cool and easy summer
meal.
</P>
<P>
   Check out these sites for loads of summer salad ideas.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lundberg Gourmet Brown Rice, at
www.lundberg.com/recipes/ssalad.html, has put together a number of

spices. Cumin, cilantro, black beans, corn, peppers, tomatoes and a
mild salsa combine with rice to make a salad with a Southwestern
flair. Sun-dried tomatoes, olives, olive oil, balsamic vinegar,
Parmesan cheese, rosemary, basil and lemon juice inspire a
Mediterranean dish.

 &HT;    From raw fish with an exotic Latin flavor to peeled shrimp
dipped in simple or fancy sauces, cold seafood dishes are hot this
summer
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a scrappy sign and not much more. I was a first-time
visitor to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico _ shy but not unwilling to
venture up an unknown flight of stairs, away from the dust and sun.
</P>
<P>
   Then something cool happened.
</P>
<P>
   While a family looked at television in one room, I sat in
another watching an old lady make a ``coctel de camarones,'' my
first Mexican shrimp cocktail.
</P>
<P>
   Behind a bar that doubled as her kitchen counter, this lady _
this saint _ chopped white onions, avocado and cilantro and dropped
it all into a monster margarita glass. She peeled some shrimp and
tossed them in. Then she ladled on a mysterious elixir that I later
discovered was hardly more than ketchup, lime juice, water and hot
sauce. She put the cocktail before me and handed me a spoon.
</P>
<P>
   Forget sex on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   This was a veritable vacation in a glass: part cold tomato soup,
part Bloody Mary, part classic shrimp cocktail. Suddenly I felt
like the world's most adventurous traveler _ and that 5-year-old
boy in flip-flops who got his first taste of the sea in Panama
City, Fla., some years ago. Never had I felt so wholly at home in
the house of a total stranger.
</P>
<P>
   So when I want a quick trip to Mexico, I hit Buford Highway in
Atlanta, where shrimp cocktails and other cold-seafood concoctions
can be found at places like Mariscolandia, Marisqueria 7 Mares and
Taqueria Las Americas. Some cities have an ocean drive, but we've
got an ocean of delicious dives, where without spending your last
sand dollar you can get everything from pickled snails to oysters
in a glass.
</P>
<P>
   Another fine option is to make your own shrimp cocktails,
seviches and other engine-cooling salads at home. This time of
year, it's hard to go wrong with a classic shrimp cocktail. Or the
Northwestern standard known as Crab Louis: shaved iceberg, chunks
of sweet crab meat, boiled eggs, tomatoes and a puddle of pink
dressing.
</P>
<P>
   No need to get fancy, either. Some of us grew up dipping peeled
shrimp in a mixture of ketchup and mayo. One colleague tells me
that at her house, it was mustard and lemon sauce (to which I might
add a little capers and horseradish). Once at a vegetarian
restaurant, I saw a zany couple ask for an order of fake ``boiled
shrimp,'' then pull a bottle of cocktail sauce out of a backpack.
</P>
<P>
   And nowadays, thanks to the Latin trend, more people are
realizing there's nothing so beachy as a taste of seviche
(pronounced ``seh-VEE-chee''). Originally cooked _ or rather, not
cooked _ in Peru, seviche is essentially raw fish marinated in
citrus juice. Mixed with fiery chiles, aromatic herbs and colorful
fruits and vegetables (mangoes, avocados, tomatoes), it appears up
and down both coasts of Latin America, from Mexico to Chile. It
would be a challenge to conjure a more clean-tasting, restorative
and element dish _ in which the flavors of the ocean splash in the
mouth like waves.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that Salvadoran-born chef Ticha Krinsky has
Peruvian-style seviche on the summer menu at Tierra, her Nuevo
Latino restaurant in Atlanta. Yet it's also popping up at
contemporary places like Insignia in Atlanta and Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   For its August issue, Gourmet magazine sent writer Calvin
Trillin 2,800 miles (to Peru and Ecuador) in search of perfect raw
fish. And at New York's Chicama, the latest venture from chef
Douglas Rodriquez (formerly of Patria), the pan-Latin guru has
installed a seviche bar with such rawsome combinations as squid and
tuna with lemongrass, ginger, lime leaves and basil. Or sole and
clams mixed with crunchy pork cracklings, ham, green tomatoes and
parsley.
</P>
<P>
   So I'm betting that seviche, and its 1,001 variations, will be
the next big trend, after sushi. ``It's just a very refreshing
dish,'' Krinsky says. ``The lime and the pepper make it a very nice
summer food. The heat really cools you off.''
</P>
<P>
   With a little lime juice, salt and imagination, you can stir up
a Latin-inflected cold seafood appetizer or main dish. If you're in
a retro mood, throw in a little ketchup or mayo, shred some
iceberg, and break out the jazz and cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   I'm feeling hungry. Peel me a shrimp.

 &HT;    Fresh is best for seafood concoctions
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Sg time: 60 minutes
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once you've tasted this easy-to-make cocktail sauce, you will
never want the bottled stuff again. Lime juice imparts a slightly
sweeter flavor than lemon juice, but either will do. Of course, you
may doctor this up with additional hot sauce or a chopped chile
pepper _ whatever you like. Any medium to large shrimp will do, but
colossal shrimp will prompt the most ``oohs'' and ``ahs.''
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup ketchup
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons white onion, very finely minced
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, very finely minced
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon horseradish
</P>
<P>
   1 lime, juiced
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon Tabasco, or other hot sauce of your choice, plus
more to taste
</P>
<P>
   Salt, to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 pounds large shrimp, cooked, peeled,
</P>
<P>
   deveined and chilled
</P>
<P>
   1 lemon, quartered, for garnish
</P>
<P>
   4 sprigs parsley or cilantro or baby romaine leaves, for garnish
(optional)
</P>
<P>
   To make the sauce: Place ketchup in small mixing bowl. Add
onion, garlic, horseradish, lime juice, Worcestershire sauce and
Tabasco sauce. Mix well, and taste for salt. Cover and chill in
refrigerator for at least 30 minutes (sauce may be prepared one day
in advance).
</P>
<P>
   To make the cocktail: When ready to serve, place shrimp around
edges of 4 chilled martini glasses. If you don't have martini
glasses, any small dish, plate or footed compote will do. Spoon
sauce into the center of each dish, garnish with lemon wedge and
herbs or lettuce. Chill for 30 minutes and serve.

   APPETIZER
</P>
<P>
   Tierra's Peruvian Seviche
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings Preparation time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 30 minutes Chilling time: 10 minutes or longer
</P>
<P>
   This has become a summer favorite at Tierra, Dan and Ticha
Krinsky's charming Nuevo Latino restaurant near the Atlanta
Botanical Garden. The authentic Peruvian chiles (see note) are what
give the dish its essential flavors. As side bites, the slices of
cold boiled sweetay adjust your own accordingly. We decided that
pisco sours, made from the Chilean or Peruvian brandy called pisco,
would be the perfect potent potable.
</P>
<P>
   2 small sweet potatoes, washed
</P>
<P>
   2 ears yellow corn, cleaned and washed
</P>
<P>
   1 pound fresh sea bass fillets
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon garlic, finely minced
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon rocoto pepper, finely minced
</P>
<P>
   (see note)
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon aji escabeche pepper (sometimes called aji amarillo),
finely minced (see note)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 small red onion, sliced paper thin
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups fresh lime juice
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon fresh parsley, finely minced
</P>
<P>
   (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Black pepper, freshly cracked (optional)
</P>
<P>
   To make the sides: Place the sweet potatoes in a pot of boiling,
salted water. Boil at high temperature for about 15 minutes, or
until the potatoes can be easily stuck all the way through with a
knife. After the potatoes have cooked for about 10 minutes, add the
corn and cook for 5 minutes. Drain the vegetables in a colander and
rinse with cold water until cool. Slice the corn into inch-long
pieces and chill in the fridge with potatoes until ready to serve.
Note: The potatoes peel better after they've chilled.
</P>
<P>
   To make the seviche: Wash the sea bass in cold water, and pat
dry with paper towels or clean cloths. Chop the fish into pieces
about 1/4-inch thick and 1/2-inch long. Place in a glass or metal
bowl. Add garlic, rocoto pepper, aji escabeche pepper, red onion
and lime juice (make sure the mixture is completely covered with
lime juice). Sprinkle with about 2 teaspoons of kosher salt and mix
very well. Chill for 10 minutes or longer in the refrigerator (it
needs at least 10 minutes ``to cook''). Before serving, taste for
salt.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble the dish: Assemble mounds of seviche in the middle
of serving plates, using a slotted spoon to drain most of the lime
juice. Peel potatoes and slice into 1/2-inch rounds. Place 2 pieces
of corn and 2 of potato around the seviche. Garnish with flecks of
parsley and a few grindings of black pepper if you wish. Note: You
may also serve the seviche in lettuce cups or compotes _ and
garnish with thin slices of leftover red onion, lime or chile
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Note on ingredients: Look for the peppers in the frozen-food
section of a Latin supermarket. We found ours at Tienda Las
Americas (3652 Shallowford Road, Doraville. 770-458-7962). Thaw,
peel and remove seeds. If you can't find them, substitute chiles of
your choice, but mash them first with a little lime juice and salt
in a mortar and pesing this method, you may add garlic during this
step).

<P>
   BEVERAGE
</P>
<P>
   Pisco Sour
</P>
<P>
   Makes 1 serving Preparation time: 5 minutes
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to go to Cuba or South America to enjoy classic
tropical cocktails like caipirinhas or pisco sours. You can find
pisco (Chilean or Peruvian brandy) and cachaca (the Brazilian sugar
cane liquor) at metro package stores (including Tower Liquor on
Piedmont Road). Pisco tastes similar to grappa _ and this drink is
a very distinctive mix of sweet and tart.
</P>
<P>
   The egg white makes it frothy, but you don't have to use it.
Personally, I prefer to forgo the egg and the bitters.
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon egg white (optional)
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons lemon (or lime) juice
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces pisco
</P>
<P>
   Crushed ice
</P>
<P>
   Angostura bitters (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Put the egg white, sugar, lemon or lime juice, pisco and plenty
of crushed ice in a cocktail shaker. Shake well. Strain into a
small glass and serve straight up. Or if you prefer, add more
crushed ice. Top with a few drops of Angostura bitters if you like.

</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Chilling time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   This makes a wonderful first course for the steak and martini
crowd. And it works equally well as a complete summer meal. Serve
with a chilled white wine and a basket of bread or saltines.
</P>
<P>
   1 cup mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup chili sauce (or ketchup mixed with your favorite hot
sauce)

   2 tablespoons onion, very finely minced

<P>
   2 tablespoons capers, finely chopped

<P>
   lettuce of your choice)
</P>
<P>
   1 pound lump crab meat, well picked over

   Perfection in a glass. Feel free to experiment with this
fail-proof recipe. You may choose to use grilled shrimp _ though it
might be better to place them around the glass. You can put salt on
the glass. And you can add more cooked seafood or raw oysters, more
hot pepper, sliced olives, small canned English peas, a dash of
olive oil _ whatever you like. A bit of freshly squeezed orange
juice will impart another dimension of flavor. Serve with saltines
or tortilla chips.
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds medium shrimp
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup freshly squeezed lime juice

<P>
   salt, more lime juice or hot sauce to taste.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble: If you want salt on the rim, moisten tall
soda-fountain or other large glasses with a bit of lime juice and
roll the glasses in a saucer lightly covered with salt. Mix the
shrimp into the sauce; then carefully spoon the mixture into the
glasses. Chill for 15 minutes in refrigerator. When ready to serve,
place a lime slice on the side of each glass. Garnish with cilantro
sprig. Eat with a spoon.
</P>
<P>
   Note: If you don't have quite enough sauce to fill glasses, add
a little cold water.

NEW ON VIDEO: ERIN BROCKOVICH, THE CIDER HOUSE RULES; NEW ON DVD:
NAKED GUN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
``Erin Brockovich''
<TEXT>
<P>
   This story of a struggling single mom who helps win a
multimillion-dollar lawsuit is based on fact. You'd think it would
be inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also a Hollywood product, and as such, it's turned into
a star vehicle for Julia Roberts, eclipsing what could have been a
rewarding, grounded yarn with mere high-concept trappings: ``A
Civil Action'' with cleavage.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts' Erin can barely make ends meet, yet she somehow can
afford to buy a wide array of flashy if trashy clothes _ just the
kind daughters bemoan on TV talk shows with the theme ``My Mom
Dresses Too Sexy!''
</P>
<P>
   When Erin coerces Albert Finney into giving her a clerical job
in his law firm, she stumbles onto a coverup of contamination of a
community's water supply.
</P>
<P>
   The film then becomes a satisfying David vs. Goliath battle,
only in this case, David wears push-up bras and stiletto heels.
</P>
<P>
   For an alleged heroine, Erin neglects her kids woefully, often
leaving them in the hands of her neighbor and boyfriend, a gallant
biker played by Aaron Eckhart.
</P>
<P>
   Like Finney and most men in the movie, Eckhart's mission in life
seems to be paving the way for Roberts to have her way. Isn't that
what the audience wants?
</P>
<P>
   With her star wattage turned up several notches, Roberts
radiates even more than her usual charm. But that's undercut by an
allegedly cute feistiness, which in truth is coarse and abusive.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, she curses so often and so loudly in public _ including
courthouse halls _ that we wonder why she isn't arrested, or at
least accosted.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a movie, where life's real rules don't always apply,
and the real Erin is submerged beneath Roberts' star trip _ not to
mention an aggressive sexuality that's all about marketing and has
nothing to do with the little guy, decency or basic integrity. &QL; 
Grade: C- &QL; 
2000, R, Universal, CC, VHS $22.98, DVD $26.98
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cider House Rules''
</P>
<P>
   Spending big bucks, Miramax tried to bully Hollywood into making
this the best-picture Oscar winner for 1999. But aside from
supporting actor Michael Caine and screenwriter John Irving, no
cigar.
</P>
<P>
   Though Irving's source novel is worthy, the film is like a
politician: It makes endless heart-tugging pronouncements, but it
doesn't really say anything.
</P>
<P>
   Allegedly, it concerns the morality of abortions, which are
supplied by a crusty doctor (Caine) at a New England orphanage in
the '30s.
</P>
<P>
   The orphan he tabs as his successor (Tobey Maguire) is pro-life.
But the film's stance is as vague as Maguire's listless line
readings.
</P>
<P>
   For him, it's a coming-of-age tale enshrined in handsome
production design and schmaltzy oversell.
</P>
<P>
   The movie has meaningful moments, to be sure, but it doesn't add
up to a satisfying whole, lacking the courage to follow through on
convictions _ if it has any. &QL; 
Grade: C &QL; 
1999, PG-13, Miramax, CC, VHS priced for rental, DVD $32.99

</P>
<P>
   Loaded with laughs
</P>
<P>
   If you've explored directors' commentary tracks on DVD, you know
how dull they can be.
</P>
<P>
   But hearing David Zucker's banter about his ``Naked Gun'' films
is almost as funny as the police spoofs themselves.
</P>
<P>
   This week brings all three ``Gun'' movies to DVD: 1988's ``The
Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!,'' 1991's ``The Naked
Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear'' and 1994's ``Naked Gun 33 1/3: The
Final Insult.''
</P>
<P>
   Each costs a suggested $29.99.
</P>
<P>
   Zucker co-wrote and directed the first two, and co-wrote and
co-produced the third. He recorded commentaries for all three,
flanked by other creators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had fun,'' Zucker said. ``We sat on sofas with mikes in
front of a screen, and everything we saw brought back memories of
stories behind the scenes.''
</P>
<P>
   More memories returned when Zucker saw the horror spoof ``Scary
Movie,'' which used the same style as his own off-the-wall hits.
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't claim credit. Instead, he traces the roots for
such films back to 1974's ``The Groove Tube'' (available on VHS and
DVD).
</P>
<P>
   Filled with nudity, drug use and unmentionables, that wild
parody of television was created by Ken Shapiro, who has now faded
into obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Groove Tube'' evolved from humor sketches Shapiro taped on
early home-video equipment and displayed, ``underground''-style, in
loft apartments around New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Zucker, brother Jerry and Jim Abrahams were inspired to create a
similar Kentucky Fried Theater in their home of Madison, Wis. It,
too, spawned a movie after they moved to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ```Kentucky Fried Movie' is far more known than `The Groove
Tube,' but that's where we got our inspiration,'' Zucker said.
``Ken led the way. We followed him every step.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's big breakthrough with 1980's ``Airplane!'' (due on
DVD Oct. 24), followed by the ``Naked Gun`` trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   But Zucker hasn't forgotten where it all began.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the '60s counter-culture humor crystallized in Ken's
movie,'' said Zucker, who feels ``The Groove Tube'' spawned two
genres.
</P>
<P>
   ``One was that whole tradition of `Saturday Night Live' sketches
(Chevy Chase appeared in `The Groove Tube'), and the other was
films like `Kentucky Fried Movie,' `Airplane!,' `Naked Gun' and
beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Groove Tube'' pushed the limits of an R rating, much like
``Scary Movie'' today.
</P>
<P>
   Not so lucky was Zucker's ``BASEketball,'' a 1998 sports parody
he wrote and directed, starring Trey Parker and Matt Stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got an R, which rated us out of our audience,'' he said.
``I understand Matt's and Trey's frustration with these censors.''
(Their ``South Park'' film, finally an R, first got an NC-17.)
</P>
<P>
   Zucker is now working on a new parody: ``FBI Man 2000.'' Unlike
his ``Naked Gun'' films, which turned dramatic actor Leslie Nielsen
into a straight-faced hoot, it will star a true comedian.
</P>
<P>
   He's also devising a remake of 1964's ``Santa Claus Conquers the
Martians,'' in which Pia Zadora, at age 10, made her film debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``She isn't acting anymore,'' he said, ``but I'm sure we can
coax her out of retirement to be in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatlemania
</P>
<P>
   MPI has reissued four Fab Four films as ``The Beatles: The
Ultimate DVD Collection.''
</P>
<P>
   The discs are ``Help!,'' ``Magical Mystery Tour,'' ``The First
U.S. Visit'' and ``You Can't Do That: The Making of `A Hard Day's
Night.''' The set costs a suggested $79.98.
</P>
<P>
   The last two are especially gear (translation: great), but the
Beatles feature ``A Hard Day's Night'' is no longer available. MPI
lost the rights to make way for a theatrical reissue.
</P>
<P>
   But MPI is trying to gain rights to two Beatles documentaries:
``Let It Be'' and ``The Making of `Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club
Band.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yellow Submarine'' also is available _ from MGM, for $19.98 on
tape and $29.98 on disc.

&HT;     A HIP GORE REACHES OUT TO VITAL VOTING BLOC: YOUNGSTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LARA JAKES  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was, like, so not a place for a political gig.
</P>
<P>
   The scene Tuesday was a dark music club in West Hollywood where
heads adorned with nose rings bobbed and bare midriffs swayed to
the free rhythm-and-blues warm-up act.
</P>
<P>
   The headliner, though prepped to talk politics to her young
audience, was no less hip. Blond and willowy like Britney, yet
worldly and savvy at age 27, Karenna Gore Schiff made her way
across the stage at the House of Blues in her latest attempt to
tear through the veil of cynicism shrouding the nation's largest
voting bloc _ 18- to 30-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our generation has been dismissed as being too self-involved
to be bothered with public life,'' Schiff, flanked by her younger
sister, Kristin Gore, told the crowd of several hundred 20-, 30-
and even a few 40-somethings at the Sunset Boulevard club.
</P>
<P>
   ``We volunteer and join political organizations more than the
famously idealistic boomers do,'' Schiff said. ``But it is also
true that there are a lot of young people who are completely turned
off to politics. And I've even felt that personally. Although I
come from a very political family, I've felt the flaws of our
modern political culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiff, who lives on Manhattan's Upper East Side and is one of
the higher-profile New Yorkers at the 2000 Democratic National
Convention, of course is an advocate of her father, Vice President
Al Gore. But she also is one of the most prominent young faces in
today's political arena _ a scene, observers note, still dominated
by older white men.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Generations X and Y make up the largest age group
involved in elections, according to John Dervin of Youth Vote 2000,
which along with MTV's Choose or Lose campaign sponsored Tuesday's
event. Those voters outnumber the older baby boomers by an
estimated 10 million _ and could determine the election.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats do not have the monopoly on fresh young faces to help
reach out to those voters. Schiff's Republican counterpart is
George P. Bush, the 24-year-old nephew of Republican presidential
nominee George W. Bush, whose smoldering good looks earned him the
distinction of being one of America's most eligible bachelors.
</P>
<P>
   But the nation's youngest voters are also among the most
unreliable on Election Day. Only one-third of registered voters age
18 to 24 cast a ballot in the 1996 presidential election, compared
with half in 1972. For this reason, young activists like Schiff and
George P. Bush are trying to recruit their peers in what could be a
tight presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, Schiff touched on the issues of abortion rights,
pollution, Social Security and the economy. ``If the economy tanks,
it is those of us at the start of our careers or at the bottom of
the ladder who have the most to lose,'' she said. Her message
appeared to resonate with the crowd _ most of it highly educated
and already politically astute.
</P>
<P>
   Even in New York state, Schiff has faced voters of all ages who
are relatively uninspired by politics this year _ and by her
father. A recent poll showed Gore leading Bush by only five points
in New York _ where any Democratic candidate should enjoy the
upside of a 5-3 voter-enrollment ratio against Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only explanation is that people have not been able to
connect to him,'' said David Kaufmann, a 40-year-old history
professor at the University of Southern California who moved from
New York City just last week. ``That `Clinton fatigue' kind of set
up this lack of enthusiasm for Gore _ what's being called `Gore
fatigue.' I think as people see him, as they get a second look,
they'll say, `Yes, he's a political hack, but he's also a good
man.' That's what these two, what Kristin and Karenna can do for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiff, a mother of a 1-year-old son named Wyatt, put law school
on the back burner to advise her father's campaign this year. She
runs Gore.net, reaching out to young voters and Gore supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Convincing members of her generation to become more politically
active is not easy now, nor has it been for the last several
decades. ``But this year, in election 2000,'' she said Tuesday,
``we must buck that trend.''

THE WHOLE WORLD'S GOING APE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
``Get your stinking paws off me, you damned, dirty ape!''
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's not quite on the level of ``Frankly, my dear, I don't
give a damn.'' But it's among the memorable lines Charlton Heston
had as an astronaut stranded on a planet of talking apes in 1968's
``Planet of the Apes.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the question is: Will Mark Wahlberg get to say something
along the same lines? The ``Perfect Storm'' star won the lead role
for a new ``Apes'' picture, tentatively titled ``The Visitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Shooting will start in October, with Tim Burton directing as his
follow-up to ``Sleepy Hollow.'' Budgeted at $100 million, the film
will open July 4, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Austin-based screenwriter William Broyles wrote the screenplay
about a space-faring human for whom the tables of dominance are
turned. But Broyles is ``under a gag order'' about his script.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's top secret,'' said Broyles, founding editor of Texas
Monthly magazine and co-writer _ with Al Reinert _ of the film
``Apollo 13.''
</P>
<P>
   He did say the new film won't be a remake of the original.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's plausibly connected to the old series,'' Broyles said,
``but doesn't share any characters with it.''
</P>
<P>
   After Burton was signed, Broyles worked with him on revisions
``for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Now other changes may be made without him. ``The writers
carousel has begun,'' Broyles said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, some top actors have been cast.
</P>
<P>
   Helena Bonham Carter, an Oscar nominee for ``The Wings of the
Dove'' and star of ``Fight Club,'' will play an ape with whom
Wahlberg has a relationship. Just how far it goes remains to be
seen, but it's rumored that human and ape mate in an early draft.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Clarke Duncan, fresh from his Oscar nomination in ``The
Green Mile,'' will play a sympathetic ape. Tim Roth, an Oscar
nominee for ``Rob Roy'' and a star of ``Pulp Fiction,'' will be a
villainous ape general.
</P>
<P>
   Roth had to choose between monkeying around and playing
Professor Snape in ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone''; the
two films' schedules will overlap.
</P>
<P>
   He opted to spend hours each day having hairy makeup applied.
</P>
<P>
   Also rumored for a part is Paul Reubens, a Burton favorite from
``Pee-wee's Big Adventure,'' ``Batman Returns'' and ``The Nightmare
Before Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Five-time Oscar winner Rick Baker (``Men in Black'') will handle
the ape makeup.
</P>
<P>
   Burton says he is ``reimagining'' the ``Apes'' project,
exploring its themes in ``a different way.'' Shooting will be in
Hawaii and on Los Angeles sound stages.
</P>
<P>
   His mission is not only to reinvent the ``Apes'' saga but also
to rekindle its ``franchise'' status for Twentieth Century Fox.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Burton should benefit not only from advanced
special effects but may adhere more closely to the far different
source novel by French writer Pierre Boulle than the first film
did.
</P>
<P>
   You can learn more about such origins in ``Behind the Planet of
the Apes,'' a fascinating two-hour documentary hosted by ``Apes''
star Roddy McDowall. It was made shortly before McDowell's death in
October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   It's available as part of a six-disc DVD set featuring all five
of the original ``Apes'' films, new this week for $99.98.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind the Planet of the Apes'' was part of an earlier VHS
boxed set, but it isn't part of a reissued VHS set, which is also
due this week. That set has only the five films, for $49.98.
</P>
<P>
   The DVD set also includes trailers, photo galleries, cast pages,
Web links and restored, digitally mastered, THX-certified versions
of the films.
</P>
<P>
   Only the first movie will be sold separately _ and only on VHS,
for $14.98.
</P>
<P>
   The '68 film was a hit and won Oscar nominations for costume
design and Jerry Goldsmith's original score. John Chambers got an
honorary Oscar for makeup, now an annual category.
</P>
<P>
   ``Planet of the Apes''' four sequels were 1970's ``Beneath the
Planet of the Apes,'' 1971's ``Escape From Planet of the Apes,''
1972's ``Conquest of the Planet of the Apes'' and 1973's ``Battle
for the Planet of the Apes.''
</P>
<P>
   As you might surmise by their almost yearly release, quality and
inspiration wound down.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox wasn't finished. After the fifth film, a live-action
``Planet of the Apes'' TV series ran for half a season in 1974
before being axed by CBS.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, an animated ``Return to Planet of the Apes'' ran
for one season on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Merchandising also fueled the ``Apes'' boom, with toys, comics
and other products. Many manufacturers will get their paws on next
year's movie, too.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, you can get your paws on the new tapes or discs to
explore a world where apes rule _ and drive humans bananas.

&HT;     DEMOCRATS TEST NEW TERRITORY, MIXING POLITICS AND FAITH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Forty years after John F. Kennedy came to this
city to accept his party's nomination, pledging allegiance to
America and not the Catholic pope, Democratic leaders are embracing
religion with chutzpah.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional fear against the mixing of church and state is
giving way to the more politically subtle _ if not cautious and
calculated _ use of religious imagery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an indication that voters are eager for a candidate
who shows an appreciation of values, who recognizes the importance
of religion in public life,'' said the Rev. C. Welton Gaddy, a
Louisiana pastor and head of the Interfaith Alliance, a national
nonpartisan group of more than 50 religious organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can convey that kind of message without falling into
the pit of marrying religious conviction and partisan politics,
that is to be celebrated, because it is a maturing stance.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the choice of Sen. Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut for the national ticket has worried some Democrats
about whether anti-Semitism will derail Vice President Al Gore in a
close election. Lieberman is an Orthodox Jew who became the party's
nominee for vice president Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Lieberman has exposed other immaturities about
American political life and religion:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Dallas chapter president of the NAACP was asked to resign
last week after he said blacks ``need to be suspicious of any kind
of partnerships between the Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan inaccurately said last
week that Lieberman has dual citizenship with Israel and questioned
``the ties that any Jewish person would have to the state of
Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan's words echoed a 40-year-old concern from when
Kennedy, a Catholic, was running for president, saying at the 1960
Los Angeles convention that he would ``reject any kind of religious
pressure'' from the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that no American, considering the really critical
issues facing this country,'' Kennedy said, ``will waste his
franchise by voting either for me or against me solely on account
of my religious affiliation. It is not relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   But four decades later, religion clearly is relevant to
Lieberman and Gore, as well as Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the
Republican presidential nominee. Gore, a Baptist, and Bush, a
Methodist, consider themselves born-again Christians, and faith has
infused their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Now the mixture of politics and religion is low-key, less
strident, less threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Religious conservatives such as Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes, who
both sought the Republican presidential nomination, were hidden
during the Republican National Convention as it strove for a more
inclusive image. The image of religion in politics expressed by
conservative Pat Robertson railing against abortion and
homosexuality is giving way to religion as a personal guide.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his favorite philosopher was Jesus Christ, and he
consistently has advocated a Calvinistic blending of bootstraps and
religious faith in helping the poor. His ``compassionate
conservative'' philosophy emphasizes church and government
cooperation to help poor people.
</P>
<P>
   After he served in Vietnam, Gore entered the Vanderbilt
University divinity school but dropped out to become a newspaper
reporter in Tennessee. He still quotes the theologians he studied
at Vanderbilt in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   In the 2000 campaign, Gore consistently has talked about
religion, although he tends to take broad stances that avoid
ideological fights when he speaks of religion; the Bible, for
example, condemns homosexuality but Gore is more interested in
larger biblical themes of love and acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the Monica Lewinsky scandal and his opinion of
President Clinton, Gore often says: ``I'm taught in my religious
tradition to hate the sin and love the sinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who invoked God a dozen times when he accepted Gore's
offer last week to join the Democratic ticket, is adept at steering
his religious talk to mild, nonspecific, uplifting messages rather
than a strident morality lesson that could turn away voters.
</P>
<P>
   An Aug. 7 Gallup poll among 667 registered voters found the vast
majority _ 88 percent _ said it makes no difference to them that
Lieberman is Jewish. Seven percent said it makes them feel more
favorably toward him, and 4 percent said less favorably.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish Americans said it seemed Gore picked Lieberman not
because his faith somehow will dictate administration policy, but
because faith guides the Connecticut senator's personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to recognize that Gore didn't go out looking
for some Jew,'' said Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder and director of the
Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles. ``He selected Joe Lieberman
because, in addition to going to a synagogue, he is a man of great
integrity. That's why it's really a moment of pride.''
</P>
<P>
   And blacks said they saw the Lieberman pick as a victory for
civil rights more than a religious conversion within the party. In
his convention speech Tuesday night, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said
Gore ``has brought the sons and daughters of slaves and slave
masters together with the sons and daughters of Holocaust
survivors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a minority, too, so we love that,'' said Toye Moses,
president of the African-American Democratic Club of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   This clearly is the subject Democrats feel most comfortable
talking about: civil rights and minorities. But for some Democrats
at the convention, the new political religion from Gore and
Lieberman is something clearly new and uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Wallis, author of ``The Soul of Politics'' and founder of a
Call for Renewal, a national coalition of churches and community
groups, said a Democrat at the convention came up to him and said
all the talk of family values and sexual ethics made him nervous,
because ``that's not traditional Democratic real estate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's right, then the Democrats have a problem,'' said
Wallis, who believes Democrats need to accept a new political
ideology that includes family and faith, mixed with government
programs that work.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we identify with one particular partisan solution, that's
the problem,'' Wallis said. ``But to keep the heat on the moral
imperative, that's the solution.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Rendi Norwood ran for student body president
at Texas High in Texarkana, she displayed a bit more political
savvy than most teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   She was the first to ever ask for a student voter registration
list, called her fellow students at night seeking their support,
and was at school at 6 a.m. the first day candidates could put up
signs to make sure she snagged the best spot.
</P>
<P>
   She won.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't hurt that her mother, Molly Beth Malcolm, is the
chairwoman of the Texas Democratic Party. Both are attending the
Democratic National Convention this week in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Now a 20-year-old government and sociology major at the
University of Texas at Austin, Norwood helped with President
Clinton's visit to Los Angeles after a summer stint as a White
House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the Monica Lewinsky jokes. This mother-daughter team
has heard them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``People make jokes, but it's one of the top internships in the
nation, and it's really a thrill to be in the White House,''
Norwood said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a wonderful president, and regardless of anything
that's happened, the White House internship is a great program,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm, 45, said it is sad that Clinton's sexual affair with
another intern _ Lewinsky _ cast a shadow on the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did tarnish what people thought, and of course, yes, every
time you'd say, `She's a White House intern,' people would roll
their eyes,'' Malcolm said.
</P>
<P>
   But she added, ``I want you to know that that was the most
fabulous experience that any young person could ever have ... I
watched her just take on so much maturity this summer from the
opportunity she had in that job.''
</P>
<P>
   Norwood worked in the White House political affairs office.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood stood at the back of a meeting room at a breakfast for
convention delegates from Texas and watched her mother hold forth
on Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard George Bush say `Don't mess with Texas' until I'm
sick and tired of hearing him say that,'' Malcolm told an
enthusiastic crowd. ``The Texas values that I learned were that
telling the truth is not always the popular thing to do, but it is
the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm has passed her priorities on to Norwood, who calls her
mother her best friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned a lot in politics from my mother, and she's been
a great role model. And not only a role model, but she's a great
mother,'' said Norwood, who uses her father's name.
</P>
<P>
   She said her mother always makes time for her, and laughed as
she recalled that high school race for student-body president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely learned a lot from watching her when I ran for
that,'' Norwood said.
</P>
<P>
   But Norwood isn't planning a future as a politician. She plans
to go to law school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be wonderful to practice law for
underprivileged people, and if there's any way that I could afford
to do that, I would love to do that,'' she said.

 &HT;    Professional designers assist students in decorating a small
space
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The student: Danielle LeSure, a junior at Emory University
majoring in educational studies.
</P>
<P>
   Danielle's objective: ``I want a room that represents me and who
I am. I like the color purple and stuffed animals. I have about 15
in my dorm room.''
</P>
<P>
   Her advice to new students: ``Do something new and creative. I
wouldn't get a lot of shelves or storage containers. In my freshman
year, after I had taken exams, I had to take them all down. That
was not fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The designer: Amy Survant, home textile specialist for Rich's
department stores.
</P>
<P>
   Survant's solution:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  She made a section of the room a study area by placing a desk,
chair, phone and clock on one side of the room. A filing cabinet
was placed underneath the desk, making it accessible, yet out of
the way.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A butterfly chair was placed near the desk. This provides a
chair for company when you're studying or entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A mini-refrigerator, microwave and storage bin for snacks were
stacked on top of each other to save space. (Check school policies
to see which small appliances are allowed.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Monogrammed towels were placed near the door so that Danielle
can grab one on the way to the shower.
</P>
<P>
   Survant's tip: ``I would paint the entire room in magnetic
(colorless) paint. It's like a sealer. Then repaint on top of that
whatever color the school has designated. It makes the walls like
magnets, so you can stick mementos, magnetic picture frames,
posters and keepsakes. It makes the room fun and it doesn't hurt
anything when you move out.''
</P>
<P>
   The student: William HumphriesIII, a senior at Morehouse College
majoring in biology.
</P>
<P>
   William's objective: ``Space, comfort and function. I like
things I can just pick up, roll out or dump into a crate or box
when I'm ready to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   His advice to new students: ``Usually one side of the room is
better than the other, so get there early so you can claim it. If
you and your roommate can work together by buying things that
coordinate, it's cheaper. If you put carpet in the room, it seems
more like home. Just don't pick a light color, because it will be
brown by the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   The designer: Grant Breining, president of Renaissance Design
Group in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Breining's solution:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  He designed a room for the small fraction of students who
don't have a roommate. Breining replaced the standard issue
dormitory bed with a futon that folds out into a bed. (Check school
policies to see if dorm furniture can be removed. Another option is
to create a loftlike area by raising the bed off the floor and
making space for a futon underneath.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The room was divided into two spaces, one for studying and one
for entertaining. Breining put the stereo and television on
entertainment units. The computer equipment was placed in a corner
on a stand.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Plastic storage bins were mounted on each side of the window
to save floor space.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Modular storage cubes double as a nightstand and coffee table,
making the room look like a living room instead of a bedroom/study.
</P>
<P>
   Breining's tip: ``The most important thing to remember is to
move in and see what you need first. Don't buy everything before
you get there, because you could find that you have too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Eds: cutline information
</P>
<P>
   Plastic modular storage cube ($19.99). From the Container Store.
</P>
<P>
   Ridgewood audio stand with black steel finish and maple accents,
$49.99. From Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   Black metal futon with heavy twill cover, $179.99. From Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   Computer cart, $299. From the Container Store.
</P>
<P>
   The students: Jennie Bell, a senior at Agnes Scott College
majoring in English, and Kristin Haeger, a sophomore at Agnes Scott
who has not declared a major.
</P>
<P>
   Jennie and Kristin's objective: ``I picked some of the things
because they rolled. It makes things so much easier to move,'' said
Jennie. ``I also picked stuff that looked comfortable. Comfort is
key because you spend a lot of time in your room.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like tall stuff,'' Kristin said, ``because it utilizes the
space above your head.''
</P>
<P>
   Their advice to new students: Load up on chairs, ottomans and
pillows.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always need extra sitting space,'' advised Jennie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' added Kristin. ``In my freshman year I didn't have
anything to sit on. I got tired of eating on the floor all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The designer: Mary Mobley-Johnson, owner, MJA in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley-Johnson's solution:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  She divided the room in half so that each girl could have her
own space. Then she used an area rug to make the room look warmer.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The sleeping area was separated from the study area by placing
the beds on either side of the wall at one end of the room. The
desks and computers are on the other end.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The arrangement provides more privacy for the sleeping area by
making the study area the first thing you see when you walk in the
room.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  By placing both desks at the same end of the room, one student
can study without disturbing a roommate who might be sleeping or
watching TV.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley-Johnson's tip: ``Don't spend a lot of money. There are
small things you can bring from home, like your aunt's old lamp or
your mother's old quilt, that can save you money and make it feel
like it reflects your own identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look for items that assemble by grooves, versus stuff you have
to screw. The stackable furniture is much more efficient, and you
don't have to worry about losing the screws when you move.''
</P>

 &HT;    Students get dorm room decorating advice
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   At 12 feet by 15 feet, with an 8-foot ceiling, the average
dormitory room is about the size of a storage shed. When you add
two college students and a couple of carloads of personal
belongings, the room becomes more like a walk-in closet.
</P>
<P>
   Decorating can be a challenge, especially for people determined
to bring all the comforts of home. Take, for instance, the mother
of a former Emory University student.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mother was an interior decorator,'' recalls Joni Tyson,
Emory's assistant director of Residence Life who is responsible for
making dorm assignments.
</P>
<P>
   ``She pulled up the carpet, repainted the walls, brought in her
daughter's canopy bed and shoved the roommate's furniture up
against the wall. Luckily, we found the room before the halls
opened, but there were a lot of dropped jaws.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't have to be that way.
</P>
<P>
   With a little creativity and space-saving furnishings, you can
make a dorm room look cool and livable.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate how it can be done, we had a staff artist draw a
typical dorm room. We then asked four students who have lived in
dorms to pick furnishings for the room. Next, we asked three design
experts to decorate the room using the artist's drawing and the
students' selections.

 &HT;    Dorm facts
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Decorating a dorm room needn't cost your life's savings. Here's
how to spruce one up without spending a fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Buy a storage trunk. It can hold bulky items and off-season
clothes, as well as be used as an end table, coffee table or stereo
stand.
</P>
<P>
   Get a few plastic crates, boxes and stackable containers. They
provide extra storage and add to the decor when they coordinate
with the room's color scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Buy a clip-on lamp that can be moved from desk to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Purchase bedding and towels in like colors so they blend with
the decor and can be laundered in one load.
</P>
<P>
   Buy plants. They add life and color to a room.
</P>
<P>
   Use throw pillows, inflatable chairs and ottomans to provide
more seating.
</P>
<P>
   Shop thrift stores for inexpensive what-nots, lamps and pictures
that will give your room a unique style.
</P>
<P>
   Use wall hooks to hang pictures or make a valance for curtains.
</P>
<P>
   Make a desk both jazzy and functional by choosing file
organizers, shelves, pen cups and stackable drawers in bold colors.
</P>
<P>
   Find metal folding chairs that can be used when entertaining
friends. They don't take up much space when stored. Spruce them up
with bright enamel paint.
</P>
<P>
   Policies restricting what students can bring to a dormitory vary
by school. Here are some items you typically cannot have:
</P>
<P>
   Window air conditioners and space heaters.
</P>
<P>
   Strobe lights, black lights and halogen bulbs over 100 watts.
</P>
<P>
   Toaster ovens, hot plates, woks, deep fryers and crock pots.
(Some schools also prohibit microwaves.)
</P>
<P>
   Candles and incense.
</P>
<P>
   dorm facts
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  There are more than 32,600 beds at the 35 public colleges and
universities in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  There are three styles of dorms: traditional, which house two
to four students and have communal showers and restrooms;
apartments for two or more that have restrooms, living and cooking
areas; and suites, which may accommodate up to eight students and
have common living areas, kitchens and restrooms.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The average age of a residential building is 30. Some of the
newest dorms in the system are 4 years old at Georgia State
University. The oldest are 93 years old, at Abraham Baldwin
Agricultural College in Tifton.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A dorm typically comes with a desk, chair, ceiling light and
bed.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  All schools have some housing to accommodate students with
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pets are typically prohibited. However, guide dogs for the
</P>
<P>
   visually impaired are allowed.

   Picked-up pieces while remembering Babe Ruth and Elvis Presley,
who both died on Aug. 16 . . .
</P>
<P>
   --The new Fenway scapegoat is batting coach Jim Rice. The Sox
aren't hitting, so it must be somebody's fault. Rice makes himself
a target with his passive work ethic and poor communication skills.
The indefatigable Walter Hriniak was ripped here for working too
hard with the hitters. Now there's Rice doing little with a gang of
hitters who aren't selective and rarely make adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   --Jimmy Piersall, the Carl Everett of the '50s, is scheduled to
appear at a memorabilia show at the Ramada Inn in Woburn, Mass.
Saturday, noon-2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   --Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods are paired at the PGA
Championship in Louisville, Ky. Reminds me of Red Sox spring
training in 1960, when Ted Williams and Carl Yastrzemski were in
the same lineup. ``I played second base in those days, so we were
never in the same outfield,'' recalled Yaz. ``But I remember him
taking batting practice and yelling at himself.'' Williams retired
in 1960. Yastrzemski was a rookie in '61.
</P>
<P>
   --The Peter Gammons lookalike contest is Aug. 26 at LeLacheur
Park, home of the Spinners, in Lowell, Mass. Winner gets two air
tickets to anywhere in the United States. Twenty-dollar bills are
not eligible. Gammons this year is up for consideration for the
Baseball Hall of Fame. The man who reinvented the way his sport is
covered should be a lock.
</P>
<P>
   --What's the record for ex-Boston College players in one NBA
trade? Bill Curley, Howard Eisley, and Dana Barros are all part of
the proposed four-team, nine-player exchange. Jim O'Brien must be
proud.

 &HT;    Think you're in charge? Look around, think again
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MCCAYSVILLE _ Living in a cabin surrounded by woods _ that is,
living with nature _ is in some ways like living with cats: You
quickly learn you're not in charge.
</P>
<P>
   During the last three growing seasons here on the ridge, I've
found that it's a waste of good time and energy to try making my
garden pristine. I've staked out a small space around the cabin and
declared it a weed-free zone _ and grown comfortable appreciating
what shows up on the rest of the land. The scrawny trees and hearty
brush that fell under saws and shears have, of course, returned
with renewed vigor. I fought them back for a while, then
discovered, as longtime mountain people knew I would, that mine was
a futile battle. So, the ``weeds'' pop up, grow tall and often
surprise in their flowering beauty. I prune saplings that shoot
from stumps when they get waist high, and I call them shrubs.
</P>
<P>
   I know who's not in charge here.
</P>
<P>
   The gardener certainly is not. Neither, however, are the weeds
and grass invaders and the trees that refuse to stay down. Fact is,
the insects rule.
</P>
<P>
   That is never truer than during the Bug Days of summer when all
of us, plants and humans and other animals, too, have been weakened
by drought and heat. When everything slows down like a (remember?)
45 rpm record played at 33 revolutions, the insects buzz and chomp
along, unfazed.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit No. 1: the amazing Japanese beetle. I've always known
these little iridescent flying bugs were at the top of many
gardeners' enemies list (years ago a friend described them with a
mix of hate and envy as ``living the perfect life; all they do is
eat and (make love)''). Before I got to know them intimately, I
thought these pests feasted and frolicked only on roses. I have
learned, alas, that their appetites range all over the garden. My
crape myrtle, for instance, opens only a few of its
watermelon-colored flowers before the beetles light into it,
feasting on blossoms yet to be. And beetles do not live by flowers
alone, finding the leaves of Yoshino cherry trees particularly
appetizing.
</P>
<P>
   When the temperatures reach August heights, I confine my
gardening mostly to appreciating (whatever the beetles and their
insect brethren leave unmunched). That, however, is easier said
than done.
</P>
<P>
   The good bugs always welcome company, of course _ butterflies
lending movement to the garden, the pest-eating ladybugs,
bumblebees that make you laugh as they shake stems when landing on
flowers. And, at, say, 7 o'clock in the morning, when the mountain
air is cool and even crisp, a stroll through the garden can be had
with pleasure. After that, however, it's a lot more dicey. After
that, the wasps nesting under the eaves are awake, along with
swarming, orifice-seeking gnats (it's not only in South Georgia
that you must learn to talk and blow bugs at the same time). Also,
particularly on still evenings, the mosquitoes come biting, though
I could have sworn we used to be mosquito-less up here on the
oft-breezy Blue Ridge. Always, unfortunately, there are the
redbugs, ticks and fleas.
</P>
<P>
   Given the challenges of outdoor life, it's not surprising that
many people spend so much time inside this time of year. And with
winter in such short supply, it's just about always this time of
year.
</P>
<P>
   How pesty are some insects? Just the other day, I saw a
hummingbird, a species that seems to thrive on ill-tempered combat
(at least with other hummers), get run away from the feeder by a
wasp.
</P>
<P>
   One day, just when I was beginning to think it was un-fun to be
outdoors, there appeared two insects that mesmerized. First came a
winged, pointy-beaked creature that looks like a dwarf hummingbird,
but actually is a hummingbird moth. Later came something even more
exotic.
</P>
<P>
   On wings big and gossamer, this brownish-gray, crabby-legged,
primeval-looking critter lit on the porch railing one sultry
afternoon, taking up residence for what must have been half an
hour, displaying itself without moving as much as a leg or an
antenna. What a dazzling treat, made better by its unfrenetic,
nonthreatening demeanor, contrasting dramatically with the tiny
bugs. While I'd never seen anything like it, Fannin County native
James Abernathy didn't hesitate when he saw the photograph: ``Oh,
that's a stonefly.''
</P>
<P>
   James added that this type stonefly (what a fly, several inches
long) is a creek-area breeder that preys on other insects.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be persuaded, perhaps, to take on a few Japanese
beetles? Combat the gnatty dread? Maybe scare straight a couple of
tyrannical city cats, named Vincent and Buuud?

ERNIE ELS EAGER TO TASTE VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ You have a lot of time to think while flying
from South Africa to Hawaii, a journey that pushes you through
multiple time zones. ``The longest trip in the world,'' said Ernie
Els, who made that trek eight months ago en route to the Mercedes
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Given Els's world-class talents, the 1999 PGA Tour season hadn't
gone particularly well for him, and though it included a win at the
Nissan Open _ hence his berth in the Mercedes _ there had been too
many misses and four substandard performances in the majors,
including two missed cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet life was good, Els said to himself. His first child,
Samantha, was a daily reminder not to take his golf worries so
seriously that people would stop calling him The Big Easy. ``Relax,
have fun, and commit yourself to a great season in 2000,'' Els said
to himself.
</P>
<P>
   After four pure rounds of golf at Kapalua on Maui, Els had what
he had hoped for _ a 16-under-par effort that dazzled the field.
Except for Tiger Woods, that is. Woods also shot 16 under, then won
in a scintillating playoff.
</P>
<P>
   Els handled defeat in a manner that fit his personality _ openly
and graciously, even more amazing given the fact that he had struck
the ball better than Woods all four days. ``I feel so sorry for
Ernie,'' said Woods's coach, Butch Harmon. ``He played better than
Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Els didn't know it at the time, it would be a scenario
that played out several more times in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At 6 feet 3 inches and 210 pounds, the 30-year-old Els, a gentle
man with a pleasant smile and a swing that is the envy of even his
fiercest competitors, is a dominating presence in the world of
professional golf. He owns two US Open titles, homes in his native
South Africa, England, and Orlando, and the respect of virtually
any person who has come in touch with him.
</P>
<P>
   So why is he bothered these days?
</P>
<P>
   Well, he isn't actually, though it's not any fun being treated
as if he's the Washington Generals playing foil to Woods's Harlem
Globetrotters routine. On the eve of the 82d PGA Championship at
Valhalla Golf Club, whatever small piece of the spotlight not being
devoted to Woods is being given to Els _ for reasons that intersect
at the major championships. Woods has a chance to win his third of
the year, while Els could finish second for a fourth time.
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday's practice round, Els said, ``When you're playing
a guy who is playing out of this world . . .''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't complete the thought. He didn't have to. It is, after
all, a topic he has had to address time after time this year,
because Woods has been that dominating and Els has been the guy
coming in second _ five times in all, four of them to Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Els followed Hawaii with a stretch of golf that many would
accept, though poor finishes left a sour taste in his mouth. He was
in the hunt at the Masters but shot a third-round 74 and finished
second, three shots behind Vijay Singh. The next week at the MCI
Classic, he faded with a 74, lost his third-round lead, and settled
for third.
</P>
<P>
   A month later at the Memorial, Els posted a scorching 64 at
Muirfield Village in Dublin, Ohio, to reach the 36-hole mark at 7
under. Pretty good, except Woods shot 63 that day and was at 10
under. When they went out together in Round 3, Els relished the
chance to again go head-to-head, but things did not go well.
</P>
<P>
   After an even-par 72 that looked like an 82 compared with
Woods's 65, Els was beleaguered. He now trailed by a staggering 10
shots, and while reporters tried to tactfully ask him the painful
question, Els saved them the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys, it's over,'' he said, waving off the suggestion of a
dramatic comeback. ``The guy is awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Els closed with a 65 that gave him the consolation prize _
second place, five shots behind Woods _ and plenty of practice for
what would come at the US Open and British Open, when the anguish
intensified.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're 15 shots behind (as he was to Woods), it's hard to
say you're second,'' said Els at Pebble Beach. A month later, Els
again shared second, eight strokes behind Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Never once has Els ducked the issue of Woods, and his praise for
the 24-year-old has always been direct and lavish. But when Els
opened the British Open with a sparkling 6-under 66, he faced a
question right away about Woods, who had shot 67.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geez,'' said Els, as close to being flustered as you'll ever
see him. ``Guys, I just shot 66. If you want to talk about Tiger,
call him.''
</P>
<P>
   No need, because Woods was soon back playing the lead role and
answering questions asked only of a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Els? He knows his role well, even if it's not what he auditioned
for. He has become so accustomed to it that when he broke through a
few weeks ago for his first win on the PGA Tour in more than a
year, Els could read the reporters' minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``For once I didn't mess it up or I didn't finish second,'' he
said after holding on at the International in Castle Rock, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the inevitable observation that Woods was not in the
field. Els fielded it gracefully: ``I think it would have been very
tough for him to beat me this week.''
</P>
<P>
   That win, however, was two weeks ago, and Els is back facing the
same questions about Woods. Again, he shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to play hard,'' he said. ``You don't have any
control over what he does. I've finished second three times in the
majors, and you have to feel pretty good about that. If I don't win
this week, I've still had a pretty good year, so I've got to look
at the positive side.''

NOBODY DOES IT LIKE BUBBA 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- When I went to buy the papers at my hotel Friday
morning, the big fellow dressed in black sat alone on an
overstuffed leather sofa in the marbled-and-glassed lobby of one of
Beverly Hill's poshest spots.
</P>
<P>
   His hands and arms shook constantly, the handsome face was
puffed out so the fineness of the features was bloated into
caricature. He sat wordless as a tourist family posed their kids on
his armrest, and I immediately recognized the Parkinson's tremor
and the Parkinsonian mask. It was Muhammad Ali. He's been beaten
and battered and laid low by a disease no one ever licked. But he
is still The Champ.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night I saw another battered champ in action. Bill
Clinton's Victory Lap began late and ran long, but the Silver Fox
tricked the networks into putting Hillary's speech on prime time,
and then he hijacked an extra half-an-hour of East Coast prime for
his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did it again,'' was the reaction of many Democrats and
admiring politicians to another vintage Clinton oration. The crowd
loved it. The TV people stayed with it all the way, despite the
visual allure of the riot police firing gas and rubber plugs at the
rowdy protesters assembled outside at the rock altar of ``Rage
Against the Machine.'' When TV bean-counters ignore the eye-candy
of LA cops sweeping up the rabble, you know they've made a judgment
about what their audience wants to watch.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted more of Bill. From the moment he began striding down
a barren underground hallway, marching toward his legacy with a
handheld TV camera tracing his prizefighter's arrival at ringside,
Clinton had his audience nailed. It was Rocky, it was Elvis not
leaving the building but coming back for a bravura performance, it
was drama, it was show-time. It was Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Just another star turn from the best professional politician
since FDR. Not since FDR's dozen has a Democrat served out eight
full years. The president who waltzed his way through 40 minutes of
triumph came into his valedictory with a 61 percent job approval
rating _ seven points higher than Ronald Reagan's when the Gipper
purred his artful convention farewell in '88.
</P>
<P>
   You look at the text, and, like every Clinton speech, it is not
great literature. Delivery is what makes Clinton unique. He
delivers an emotional wallop so consistently that his enemies gnash
their teeth at how he gets away with it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton unrolled a lip-chewing, voice-breaking recap of the hard
luck stories he heard in '92, then an expiation of his economic
successes in a handful of phrases that seemed far more coherent and
persuasive than whatever Gore has stumbled through along the trail.
Has there ever been a president with such a lusty appetite for the
job?
</P>
<P>
   We got used to presidents rusting out. Gerry Ford and Jimmy
Carter looked shopworn in defeat, Ronald Reagan lost to the mists
of Alzheimer's, and Clinton scuffed and scorned and impeached and
then, Houdini-like, out of his shackles, out of the shark-tank,
soft-shoeing back on stage, rasping out thanks ``from the bottom of
my heart, for the honor and blessing of a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   He is a man of vast appetites, not all of them salubrious, but
clearly his appetite for the job has not diminished. What's he do
after Jan. 20 next?
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me at breakfast one day he'll become a golf pro and go
on the Senior Tour and make some money,'' shrugs Boston Mayor Tom
Menino. With a seasoned pol's knack for handicapping, Menino said
Al Gore will be OK; he's no Clinton, said the mayor, but then
nobody is. ``Gore will be OK when he gets off this glide path he's
on, and realizes he's in a fight. We're all better when we face up
to it, that we really want the job.''
</P>
<P>
   So nobody does it like Bubba. Millions wish he could come back
for four more years; millions wish him consigned to toast in
purgatory, or lower. He redefined his party, he redefined himself a
dozen times while we watched and tried to follow what he was doing.
He is the Muhammad Ali of our age, a politician who retires not
undefeated, but yet never truly beaten.
</P>
<P>
   He won't quit, he won't stop, he confounds his enemies and his
critics in the Fourth Estate. He is bigger than the job. He'll
remain bigger than either of the pair who'll succeed him. To the
end, he teased his audience. His text read, ``Remember, whenever
you think about me, keep putting people first.''
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the people I polled thought he pronounced it
``Whatever you think of me . . .,'' which conjures up all sorts of
Freudian slippage and Monica-esque reverberations. ``You heard what
you wanted to hear,'' said one veteran speechwriter. And maybe
that's Clinton's secret: you hear what you want to hear.

DEMOCRATS PLACE LIEBERMAN IN THE SPOTLIGHT

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Democratic Party on Wednesday prepared to
celebrate the selection of Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman as Vice
President Al Gore's vice-presidential running mate, while assuring
the party's diverse constituencies that, despite a platform aimed
at the center to draw voters from outside the Democratic fold, the
party will not ignore the concerns of more liberal Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, whom Gore named as his choice last week, arrived in
Los Angeles early Tuesday from St. Louis, where he had been
campaigning with Gore. Lieberman promptly met with about 300 black
delegates who had expressed unease over his past criticism of
racial preference programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was for affirmative action, am for affirmative action and
will be for affirmative action,'' he told the delegates. He also
promised to defer to Gore on school vouchers, another volatile
issue on which the presidential candidate is more liberal.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut senator, who has expressed centrist positions on
those issues along with military spending and Social Security, was
likely to continue reassuring the party's more liberal base when he
addressed the full convention Wednesday evening. Some core
Democrats, union members and black voters among them, have been
worried that Gore is taking them for granted in moving toward the
political center to attract independents and liberal Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the convention approved a platform that promises to
make Social Security safe and secure; invest more in education and
training teachers; provide affordable healthcare for children and a
patient's bill of rights; strengthen Medicare; and protect the
environment. With both political parties criticized for taking vast
amounts of money from special interests to wage their campaigns,
the platform also declares that as president, Gore will submit a
campaign reform bill to Congress and fight until the bill becomes
law.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, following Lieberman's speech _ which could
be as critical of the Republicans as it is supportive of Gore _ the
4,402 delegates are scheduled to take up the formal business of
nominating Gore as the Democratic Party candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   His onetime rival for the nomination, former Sen. Bill Bradley
of New Jersey, told the convention delegates on Tuesday: ``It's
absolutely essential that we get behind Al Gore. I support him. I
endorse him. I'll work hard for his victory.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Electing Al Gore and Joe Lieberman is the right thing to do
for our country,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's nomination was locked up in March by an unbroken string
of victories in the early state primaries, but a minority of
delegates came to the convention committed to Bradley and are now
free to support Gore. With the outcome assured, the nomination
process will be a colorful spectacle in which the delegates go
through the motions of being polled state by state on their
support.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gore's daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, a new law school graduate
who is one of his closest campaign advisers, has been asked to take
the podium and introduce the roll call that nominates her father
for president.
</P>
<P>
   The roll call has been structured so that the delegations from
Tennessee and Connecticut, the respective home states of Gore and
Lieberman, will declare the votes that give Gore the majority he
needs for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will speak on Thursday, the final night of the four-day
convention, when he accepts his party's nomination in an address
intended to rally uncommitted voters as well as the party faithful.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president and his wife, Tipper, are scheduled to arrive
in Los Angeles Wednesday afternoon and to be greeted at Burbank
airport by a contingent of California supporters.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lieberman distanced himself from other Democrats in 1998 when he
rose in the Senate to criticize the behavior of President Clinton
in the Monica Lewinsky scandal. His selection as Gore's running
mate was seen in part as an effort to inoculate Gore against
Republican charges that he is part of a morally tainted Clinton
administration. Lieberman is the first Jew to run for the vice
presidency on a major party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Other prominent Democrats scheduled to address the convention
Wednesday include John Sweeney, the president of the AFL-CIO; Gov.
Gray Davis of California; the House minority leader, Rep. Richard
Gephardt of Missouri; and the television actor Jimmy Smits.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who spoke on Monday night to an enthusiastic audience
of convention delegates, met Gore on Tuesday in Monroe, Mich., to
pass the political torch and endorse his vice president's
candidacy. ``He is the right person to be the first president of
the 21st century,'' Clinton told the crowd.

MR. FUSSY RELUCTANTLY FACES VACATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vacations are always a difficult time for Mr. Fussy. He really
doesn't want to go anywhere. Life at home is fine by him. And if he
is forced to travel, it mustn't be by airplane, and it mustn't be
to relax. Not for nothing does Mr. Fussy have a shirt monogrammed
with the words ``High on Stress.''
</P>
<P>
   The 300-pound writer G.K. Chesterton, in analyzing the three
kinds of leisure (it occurs to Mr. Fussy that the English have as
many words for rest and relaxation as the Eskimos have for snow),
concluded that the ``most rare and precious'' form of leisure ``is
being allowed to do nothing.'' But Mr. Fussy doesn't want to do
nothing. Like Mr. Chesterton, who trumpeted the glories of
inactivity while churning out over 100books, Mr. Fussy wants to
keep himself occupied.
</P>
<P>
   There are,of course,socially approved pastimes while on
vacation. For instance, you can spend more time with your children.
But Mr. Fussy already spends lots of time with his children, so
much that he can name upward of 60 Pokemon monsters (Snorlax!), to
say nothing of the three wizardry schools featured in Harry Potter
(Beauxbatons! Durmstrang! Hogwarts!). His children are begging him
to go off to work and get out of their hair.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, one can spend a vacation visiting new countries and
broadening one's horizons. But isn't that why God invented the
Discovery Channel?
</P>
<P>
   Many of Mr. Fussy's friends claim to spend their vacations
communing ``with a huge stack of books,'' which means one of
several things:
</P>
<P>
   1. Mr. Fussy's friends are very pompous.
</P>
<P>
   2. Mr. Fussy's friends are liars.
</P>
<P>
   3. Mr. Fussy's friends are speed readers who vacation
exclusively in rainy climes.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Fussy took two books on his most recent vacation and
finished them both. They were: ``Back Bay,'' William Martin's
wonderful page turner about three centuries of nefarious doings in
the blue-blood Pratt family, and Stanley Booth's recently reissued
``The True Adventures of the Rolling Stones,'' which a friend
assured him was the definite account of sex, drugs, and rock 'n'
roll in the 20th century. Well, yes.
</P>
<P>
   (Special bonus book excerpt: Mick Jagger to Stanley Booth, 1968
_ ``I mean, we're so OLD. . . . I've got to think about the future,
because obviously I can't do this forever.'')
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Fussy could not imagine vacation anywhere except for Canada.
You don't have to take a plane to get there, and the natives speak
two of the great languages of the civilized world _ the language of
Shakespeare, and the language of love. It's an interesting country,
but not distractingly so. For instance, a visit to the Potato
Museum in O'Leary, Prince Edward Island, is purely optional. Mr.
Fussy speaks from experience.
</P>
<P>
   Canada has plenty of rain to facilitate book-reading, and,of
course, it is a very neat and fussy place. Here is a not untypical
Canadian advisory for tourists journeying to ``Shipping News''-land
by ferry: ``Vehicles traveling to Newfoundland must have no more
than 3/4 of a tank of gas.'' Nominal purpose: to prevent gasoline
spills in high seas. Do they check your gas gauge? A staffer
assured me they are not that fussy.. . .
</P>
<P>
   After several decades of vacationing in Canada, Mr. Fussy has
grown attached to the place, and will miss it when it is gone. Its
imminent disappearance was recently predicted by Robert Kaplan in
his book, ``The Coming Anarchy.'' American territorial and cultural
hegemony will result in ``the peaceful dissolution of Canada,'' Mr.
Kaplan writes, not very convincingly. But Mr. Fussy doesn't like to
criticize people who have treated him graciously at parties, e.g.
Janet Langhart, wife of our poetasting Secretary of Defense, and
Mr. Kaplan fulfills this criterion.
</P>
<P>
   Once Canada is gone, Mr. Fussy will have nowhere to vacation.
It's conceivable that he could learn how to make triple-batter
onion rings in his kitchen, and engineer a mini-golf course in his
back yard. Perhaps ``Land of Giotto'' will be playing on the
Discovery Channel. Who needs anything more?
</P>
<P>
   (With gratitude and apologies to the late Roger Hargreaves,
creator of the wonderful children's book character Mr. Fussy.)

COUPLE SHOULDN'T TAP HIGH-YIELD ASSETS UNTIL NECESSARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Q. We are about five years from retiring at age 59. We hope to
take as much income as possible from our assets, which we plan to
divide evenly between stocks and stock funds and cash and bonds.
But we would like the principal to keep up with inflation so we can
leave to our heirs the same value, if not more. You have often
suggested taking income from a GNMA or similar fund, yielding about
6.5 percent. What bothers me about that strategy is that due to
inflation the value of that side of the portfolio would erode in
the considerable number of years we will have in retirement. I
thought of taking the dividends from stocks and funds, and maybe
even the capital gains distributions, and then taking only 50
percent of the yield from the bond side of the portfolio,
reinvesting the balance. Do you perceive any holes in my plan?
</P>
<P>
   W.R., Hellertown, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   A. First off, you will draw less money from your assets if you
take half of the yield from the fixed-income side, plus dividends
from the equities and stock funds. If you average 6.5 percent on
your fixed-income portfolio, you would draw $22,750 there, plus
$14,000 from your stocks, presuming (and probably presuming quite
generously) an average 2 percent yield from your equity
investments. That would bring you a total of $36,750 in annual
supplemental income. That figure would rise if you took any capital
gains distributions, but that flow would be irregular, and
sometimes might represent a reduction in the principal value.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, taking that approach would mean you are drawing funds
both from the lower-earning, fixed-income portfolio and the
higher-earning stock accounts. In contrast, if you took all of the
yield from your fixed-income investments _ a maximum of about
$45,500 _ and left the stocks alone, all of the reinvestments would
go to the side of the portfolio that promises higher long-term
growth. In the end, the more money you leave in stocks, the higher
the long-term portfolio growth you can expect. Conversely, the more
money you withdraw from the stock accounts, the slower the
expectations of growth should be.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how I would arrange things. Begin by setting a
supplemental income stream you feel you need, presumably somewhere
between that low of $36,750 and the high of $45,500. If the amount
you need is less than the actual yield from your fixed-income
portfolio, you could invest the excess on the stock side.
Presumably, as time passes and as inflation erodes the value of
your income stream, you will be drawing more and more of the
fixed-income yield. Then, at some point, you will find that the
total yield is inadequate, and you will want to move more assets to
the fixed-income side. But in the meantime, you will have kept the
maximum amount of your assets on the side of the portfolio from
which you should expect the maximum growth.
</P>
<P>
   One further suggestion: If you can make the moves without
unpleasant tax consequences, you should arrange your portfolio so
the tax-deferred accounts not only contain just stocks, but also
your most aggressive stock positions. That is because you will not
be required to take withdrawals from these accounts for the first
11.5 years of your retirement, providing a lot of time for
tax-deferred growth.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I work for a nonprofit organization and receive housing as
part of my job. My employer doesn't contribute to a retirement
plan. I also run a consulting business from which I earn $10,000 a
year, all of which I have been saving in balanced funds with an eye
toward buying my own housing. Next year, my employer will move the
403(b) account to Vanguard, which has a larger selection of funds
and lower fees. What Vanguard funds would you suggest I use? Should
I continue to use the fund in which I have my Roth IRA invested?
Where should I be investing the money from my consulting business
if I plan to buy a house within five years? Will I have sufficient
income to support myself in retirement if I continue saving at the
current rate?
</P>
<P>
   L.Y., Pittsfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You might be able to go ahead with the home purchase, but it
strikes me as a bit foolish. To begin, let me spell out the
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   If you continue to save at current levels in the 403(b) and Roth
IRA accounts and realize 10 percent average annual market returns,
you would amass $932,390 over 16 years. That sounds impressive, but
it shrinks considerably when you consider inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you decide you can live in retirement on 60 percent of
current earnings _ probably feasible only if you can look forward
to Social Security benefits. That would mean you would need your
savings to produce the equivalent of $33,000 in today's money. If
inflation averages 3.5 percent, it will take $57,221 to do the
trick. While there would, indeed, be enough to provide that income
stream initially, you would have very little remaining to protect
you against later inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's suppose you add to your retirement savings both your
consulting income and the balance that has built up in the account
you have mentally earmarked for your home purchase. Your
accumulation at age 68 would then be $1,487,647, using the same
assumptions as above. This would not only support the target
lifestyle, but leave you with excess income _ which might then be
put toward a home.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the problem of building a sufficient nest egg for
retirement, there is another reason you might have second thoughts
about buying a home. If you abandon the free housing, it's unlikely
your employer will increase your salary enough to cover the costs
of the new place. So not only would your retirement savings be
accumulating too slowly, but your housing costs would increase,
probably dramatically, when you factor in real estate taxes,
maintenance, and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   To throw more cold water on this option: It would seem that if
you do not expect any significant retirement income from Social
Security, it probably would be a major mistake to go ahead with the
home purchase in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   OK, let's suppose you do anticipate Social Security income, and
you think I'm all wet. You go ahead with buying a home _ after all,
isn't owning your home the American dream? In that case, since you
set a five-year timeframe for this investment, I suggest you move
from the balanced funds into something much safer _ a short-term
bond fund at the most aggressive, but preferably CDs or
money-market funds. (The nation's highest rate on one-year CDs was
7.35 percent, and that looks very attractive to me if you decide to
go ahead with the plan to buy.) If you are going to use this money
within five years, even the relatively conservative balanced funds
are too aggressive as a savings vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you decide to wait until retirement to buy
a home, you are investing the funds from your consulting business
too conservatively, and I would then switch from the balanced funds
to all-stock funds.
</P>
<P>
   As for how to invest your 403(b) money once the account is moved
to Vanguard, I would put 50 percent in Vanguard Index 500, and 12.5
percent each in Vanguard Mid-Cap Index, Vanguard Small-Cap Index,
Vanguard International European Equities Index, and Vanguard Health
Care.
</P>
<P>
   I do not, though, like Vanguard LifeStrategy growth fund for
your Roth IRA. Although this is the most aggressive of the
LifeStrategy group, take a careful look at what it holds. About 10
percent of its assets are in Vanguard's Total Bond Market Index
fund, and 25 percent-plus is in Vanguard Asset Allocation fund.
Asset Allocation, in turn, holds nearly 69 percent of its assets in
cash and bonds, meaning that between these two investments you have
nearly a quarter of this money in bonds or cash. That should put a
drag on long-term growth. I suggest you move this money either to
Vanguard's Index 500 or to its US Growth fund.

PATRIOTS PUTTING RECEIVERS IN MOTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ For eight years, he got to play alongside
someone he genuinely liked and respected, and now, as is often the
case in the cold world of the NFL, Troy Brown advances to No. 2
receiver for the first time in his pro career at the expense of his
best friend, Vincent Brisby.
</P>
<P>
   Roommates in their younger years with the Patriots, Brown and
Brisby (along with Drew Bledsoe and Todd Rucci) have had the most
seniority on the Patriots. Whenever there is a chipping away at the
veteran alliance _ as there was when Brisby was cut Monday _ there
is sadness among the inner circle, just as there was when Sam Gash,
Dave Wohlabaugh, Todd Collins, and Ben Coates were jettisoned for
reasons that the Patriots explained with cents rather than sense.
</P>
<P>
   One thing remains very clear in this organization: There's no
room for sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good friend of mine,'' said Brown. ``It's sad, we've
been together for eight years, but I'm sure he'll be someplace
soon. He's a good receiver and a professional guy.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Brown will be out of his trademark ``slot''
spot, where he made his mark. At times, he'll still line up there,
especially when Tony Simmons, the other beneficiary of Brisby's
departure, is on the field. But the Patriots feel having Brown on
the field all the time is better than having Brisby there some of
the time. Brown will join Terry Glenn as a starter, which means the
Patriots will go small at receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too much has changed for me,'' said Brown. ``I just have
to go out and make plays. We have to shuffle some guys around, but
now we'll have Tony and Terry and Chris (Calloway) coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he was ``a little surprised'' by the move, given that
Brisby had worked so often with the first team. He said he spoke to
Brisby Monday night and wished him well.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bill Belichick said it was difficult to say goodbye to
someone like Brisby, whom he called ``a very professional player.
``I wanted to be fair to Vincent,'' said Belichick. ``I didn't want
to release him at the end of camp. Hopefully this will give him a
chance to hook on with another team. He's worked hard and he
deserves that.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown doesn't think his new role will be a difficult adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done work on the outside,'' he said. ``I do that all the
time in practice. I know what it's like. It's not a total change
for us and I'll still be in the slot at times.''
</P>
<P>
   What might be different is his special teams work. He may still
return punts but relinquish kickoff returns to Kevin Faulk, J.R.
Redmond, and Antwan Harris. Belichick said he will monitor Brown's
playing time and may ``relieve him'' of some special teams duties.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who signed a five-year, $12.5 million deal in the
offseason (with a $2.5 million signing bonus), said, ``I'm sure he
expects a lot of good things from me. I like the opportunity to be
on the field more. I didn't know how they were going to do it; now
it's clear-cut. I still have to earn it.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan now is for Calloway, who was signed as a free agent
Monday, to take Brown's slot role. He's a similar receiver to
Brown. Calloway is not yet in football shape, having sat a long
time since being released by the Falcons over the winter. He said
the Patriots first called him about two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie (Weis) has a wide-open scheme,'' said Calloway. ``He
gets the ball to a lot of receivers, and Drew is a great
quarterback. The potential is there.''
</P>
<P>
   Calloway, an 11-year veteran, had his worst season last year
after signing a three-year deal with the Falcons. He said he
started off on the wrong foot when he suffered a high ankle sprain
in camp and then had various knee and groin injuries during the
season that limited him to six starts and 11 games in all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've enjoyed my career, and if nobody called I would have been
comfortable in any situation,'' said Calloway. ``I've been working
out, but you always have to get in football shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating as an athlete to know I had a decent year
the year previous (62 catches with the Giants). I just have to be
in better shape and stay injury-free.''
</P>
<P>
   Calloway is far from a lock to make the roster. He must be in
shape, and he must be better than Sean Morey, who can play special
teams, and Dane Looker, who would cost the Patriots a sixth-round
pick in the deal they made with the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the case every year with me,'' said Calloway. ``You
have to prove yourself all over again. When I look at other teams
and other players, I can contribute _ no doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons has been handed his best opportunity for playing time.
Brown likely won't be doing what Shawn Jefferson did last year _
basically running deep to draw coverage away from Glenn. Brown's
strength is catching the quick pass and then making something
happen. The job of ``decoy'' belongs to Simmons, who can outrun
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   After expressing his sadness over Brisby's departure, Simmons
said the move ``opened up another opportunity to get on the field.
Yeah, it is a show of confidence, but you don't want a show like
that. It can happen to anyone in the NFL. It was a surprise to all
of us. It's part of the deal and part of our job.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons said he'll likely have more responsibility on special
teams and as the third receiver. In his third season _ a time when
many players are made or broken _ Simmons has learned to take the
criticism and just move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't go into the past,'' said Simmons. ``People will look
at me in a certain way: `He's a disappointment, he slipped his
second year.' I can't make what people say about me valid. I didn't
have a bad year, I was just put in a different situation. I have
the confidence I can be on this team. I've shown positive things,
but that's just preseason. I don't feel any pressure. Now I know my
role more.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if it all comes together, the Patriots, who had little
depth at receiver to begin with, appear to have less now. On a team
that has many other pressing needs, they have spent a lot of time
on the receiver spot the past few days, deleting more than they've
added.

PERFECTLY LA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Bill Clinton is often in an LA state of mind. Al
Gore and Joe Lieberman seldom are. The California writer Carey
McWilliams once summed up this city in a way that explains its most
famous fan: ``Los Angeles did not acquire an image so much as it
projected an image which produced a city.'' This vast offramp for
the other-directed was the perfect podium for the president's
valedictory.
</P>
<P>
   His always-accommodating, please-everyone oratory conceals the
central truth of the Clinton era: His deeds outweigh his words. He
has plenty to brag about, which means he doesn't have to. But he
does because he fancies himself a fine orator, which is why he
magnifies his misdeeds by trying to talk his way out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Except for bungled denials, his words are not memorable. This
was true Monday night, when he trod that well-worn bridge and cited
the philosophical wisdom of Fleetwood Mac lyrics. Ah, but his
performance: He enraptured the audience from the start, with his
victory-lap entrance, seemingly from San Diego. The lighting in the
Staples Center followed his script with rock-star atmospherics, the
president's roadies massaging the crowd's emotions during a
40-minute solo. Clinton shone in narrative light, in expository
light, in hortatory light. But never did the central spotlight dim
and flicker. Great production values, as we say in showbiz. It's
always about Bill. Very LA.
</P>
<P>
   He also summed up his administration's accomplishments in a way
most voters could understand. That is why some Los Angeles workers
are pleased with the Clinton era. As they grouted loose bricks
along Figueroa Street last weekend, a visitor asked, ``Que pasa?''
The smiling answer: ``Overtime!'' Also as a security precaution,
downtown banks and shops were boarded up against possible riots.
But in 1992, when Clinton was first elected, a deep recession
boarded up many storefronts here.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hair's a little grayer, my wrinkles are a little deeper,''
Clinton told a happy convention at the Staples Center. After eight
years, this city seems brighter and younger, its motto no longer
``retail space available.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention crowd cheered, yet underneath, existential dread
shimmered. Is this really a wrap? The passage of power from
president to vice president is often awkward, ever since Andrew
Jackson anointed Martin Van Buren in 1836.
</P>
<P>
   In Raymond Chandler's novel about Los Angeles, ``The Long
Goodbye,'' a character becomes weary with her hero: ``The girl gave
him a look which ought to have stuck at least four inches out of
his back. It didn't bother him enough to give him the shakes.''
That could be Tipper Gore or any other Democrat wondering about
this lengthy farewell. Can Clinton stop politicking, stop
kibitzing, stop talking? Will he decamp to a Trappist monastery for
a vow-of-silence regimen? No, it's hard to picture Clinton as a
monk. It's even harder to see him as a vice president, a position
that requires tact and discretion.
</P>
<P>
   A VP can be, as Hillary Clinton called Gore here, ``a trusted
partner.'' Constitutionally, the job is a cipher. The first veep,
John Adams, thought he should be addressed as ``your superfluous
majesty.'' The vice president is often, as the alternative rock
group, Korn, would put it, ``a freak on a leash.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been a silent partner, an inner-directed cigar store
Indian, a mannequin of deference and loyalty. Now he must become
something like one Chandler character says of another in ``The Long
Goodbye'': ``Tarzan on a big red scooter.''
</P>
<P>
   The torch of the Democratic Party is being passed, in painfully
slow motion. Clinton's expansive, other-directed, image-projecting
personality swallowed up its ideological differences.
Self-absorption has its uses. Clinton pleased the groundlings in
his farewell, as well as the royalty upstairs. Soon, voters will
find out if he taught Gore how to be a spokesman for skybox
populism.

&HT;     EDUCATION DOESN'T ALWAYS MAKE OR BREAK A CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ What sort of an education should you get if you
want to influence the nation's financial markets? Study the
clarinet and saxophone at the Julliard School of Music, which is
what Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan did.
</P>
<P>
   In the tech world, though, you are better off majoring in
medieval history and philosophy at Stanford. Just like Carly
Fiorina, the chief executive of Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   Career paths are like that sometimes, and they should be. There
is no such thing as picking the wrong major in college or choosing
the wrong company or career.
</P>
<P>
   If you are in a career funk, here three questions to ask
yourself that might tell you if anything is seriously wrong:
</P>
<P>
   _ Why am I here?
</P>
<P>
   Write a sentence describing exactly why you are in your
particular career. People choose careers for all sorts of reasons,
and some don't stand the test of time. Were you pressured by your
parents to run the family business or choose a particular major?
Did you drift into the career because nothing else sounded
appealing? Did an unplanned pregnancy cause you to take a quick-fix
career rather than something you really wanted?
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly nothing wrong with taking over the family
business or choosing the same career as one of your parents did, as
long as you are doing it with eyes open. But if you are pushed into
it, you can end up resenting your career.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you make a wise choice, but then the job or career
changes over time. Just about every career has gotten more hectic
because of layoffs and the tight job market, but has your
fundamental source of enjoyment changed? Have you hit a plateau? Is
there a logical reason to believe the situation will get any better
_ or worse?
</P>
<P>
   Your options also change. Just as some careers will continue to
go downhill, other opportunities are rising. If you settled on a
career just because it seemed like the best opportunity at the
time, re-evaluate your options every five or 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Don't assume that you will have to sacrifice for years to make a
change. The Internet has made it easier to study at home, and some
technology jobs like Web page design don't demand a lot of formal
training to learn the basics.
</P>
<P>
   _ Why can't I leave now?
</P>
<P>
   People will stay in jobs for years or even decades out of a
sense of obligation to someone else. That can be a perfectly noble
thing to do, but it can also be an excuse for your own inertia.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech in San Francisco earlier this year, Mae Jemison
described how she felt a sense of obligation to stay with NASA in
the early 1990s because she was the only black female astronaut.
Eventually, though, she decided to move on, starting a project that
improves technology in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I have to get only one opportunity and have to keep it for
life?'' she said. No, she decided.
</P>
<P>
   There are all sorts of ways you can serve humanity without
suffering yourself. Make sure you have explored your options.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you want to stay in your unsatisfying but high-paying job
so your children can go to college. That's fine, as long as you
have discussed it with them. Maybe they would rather pay for
college themselves than have parents who are working all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you have practical reasons to stay. You want to wait
because you will be vested in the pension plan in another year.
Fine. But what are you doing now so you will be ready to move in a
year and a day?
</P>
<P>
   One of the easiest things to do is play the martyr, to say that
you can't make a change because of your kids or your parents or
even your clients. That certainly can be true, but none of those
people would want you to have a miserable life.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure those explanations and others _ such as being too
harried to do any job hunting _ aren't just rationalizations for
your own inertia. It's possible that deep down, you don't want to
move because your job is truly fulfilling and you have been taking
it for granted. It's also possible that deep down, you are just
plain lazy and don't want to admit it.
</P>
<P>
   You make the call.
</P>
<P>
   _ Am I good at what I do?
</P>
<P>
   Call this a hunch, but golf is probably a lot more fun if you
shoot in the 70s than in the 170s. It's true with careers, too.
</P>
<P>
   If your boss doesn't appreciate you and you can never land a
good job or promotion, at least consider the possibility that you
aren't very good at what you do. That is nothing to be ashamed of.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you have talent but have gotten into a vicious circle. You
feel unappreciated, so you stop trying, which makes your boss
appreciate you even less. That leaves you with three choices: Get
out of the circle, get out of the company, or get out of the
career.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can always do nothing, which will allow you to do
to the impossible: You can be in a circle but still manage to paint
yourself into a corner.
</P>
<P>
   Be honest with yourself. Maybe you have given the career a good
shot and have gotten the best training you could, but you just
don't have the talent to succeed. That is nature's way of telling
you it is time to move on. Pay attention.

 HANOVER, Mass.: ... physical therapy.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Mel Glenn is a specialist in physical medicine who has
treated Gilpatrick since 1998. ``Any spinal cord injury is better
if it's incomplete, since all function is not lost,'' he says.
``However, it's extremely unusual to make dramatic improvement
years after the injury. John had no good reason to think he'd walk
again.''
</P>
<P>
   For Elaine and Allen Jones, the reality of John's condition took
quite a while to sink in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we'd get John a treadmill or something and he'd be
OK,'' says Elaine Jones. ``But you could tell John was really
scared those first few days. My rule was, if you came to see him in
the hospital, you'd better have a smile on your face.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hallway outside her son's room, she adds, ``I'd see his
friends walk out and burst into tears.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next year and a half, Gilpatrick could not scratch his
nose, sit up, or feed himself. In 1998, the Globe's Dan Shaughnessy
wrote a column highlighting the fact that while Roy had become a
celebrity of sorts, Gilpatrick, who had also been the beneficiary
of fund-raisers and other outpourings of public support, was
relatively unknown outside Hanover and Suffolk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a competition of celebrity,'' Gilpatrick commented
then. ``I know there are other people that go through the same
deal,'' he added, ``and it's a lot harder for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, when pressed, Gilpatrick admits to being discouraged
about his condition for the first three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had down moments that were tough to handle, sure,'' he says.
``But the more things I did to keep myself positive, in school or
with my friends, the better I did. You can't change (what happened
to) your body.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilpatrick returned to school, majoring in criminal justice
while taking a part-time class load. His professors accommodated
him with lecture tapes and class notes. A specialized computer
allowed Gilpatrick to write papers and communicate with the outside
world. This spring, in what friends assumed was the dramatic
highlight of The John Gilpatrick Story, he rolled onstage and
picked up his diploma.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gilpatrick underwent two years of treatment at the
Shepherd Center in Atlanta, a world-renowned facility for spinal
cord patients where Roy was also being treated. Gilpatrick's four
visits lasted from six weeks to four months each. Allen Jones took
an apartment nearby, and John's friends flew in for visits. The
work was arduous: Gilpatrick's body could not even be moved into a
sitting position.
</P>
<P>
   At group sessions, says Gilpatrick, ``they'd always give you the
worst-case scenario. And that's basically what I got.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd Center doctors later confirmed that Gilpatrick's
failure to make much progress in the first two years meant there
was little hope he ever would.
</P>
<P>
   The family made changes that reflected that bleak prognosis.
They built an addition to their home that included a wheelchair
ramp and bedroom suite with handicap-access bathroom for John. They
acquired Ice, who not only helped with tasks like opening the door
or taking off John's shoes but also provided companionship and
emotional support. Over time, Gilpatrick's friends began to sense a
degree of resignation setting in. John was putting on weight. He
was not working out as devotedly. Michael Murphy, one of
Gilpatrick's closest friends, says it affected all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my own mind, I was coming to grips with the fact that my
best friend would never be the same,'' says Murphy. ``My goal was
to buy a house with a wheelchair ramp so we could hang out at my
place, not just his.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilpatrick wears a small gold cross around his neck. Ask him
about it, and he'll warn you that he's not particularly religious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a bad Christian,'' he says with a warm smile. ``Other
people prayed for me, but I never really did.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not exactly true, says Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started going over to John's house and reading the Bible
with him,'' he says. ``Here we were, two guys who'd been wild and
crazy at the age of 19, 20, and now at 25, 26, we're looking in the
Bible for answers. It wasn't about religion to us so much as
spirituality. But yes, it meant a lot to John. And me.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, John Gilpatrick woke up one morning and felt a
burning sensation in his spine, indicating recovery of some nerve
sensation. He knew he was going to walk again.
</P>
<P>
   He did.
</P>
<P>
   Miracle, maybe. But don't pencil him in for next year's Boston
Marathon just yet. His heels are painfully sore after years of
inactivity. Three weeks ago marked the first time he moved his
right arm in 4 1/2 years. He can't feel anything in his left arm,
and he's a little heavier than his hockey-playing weight. Balancing
on uneven surfaces is like skating on a Min-Waxed marble floor. But
who's complaining?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in the Gilpatrick household, certainly. And the way he
chose to show off to his pals was classic Gillie. One by one, he
walked back into their lives. Literally.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Brinkman works at the Norfolk County sheriff's office.
Gilpatrick called him up there a couple of weeks ago and told him
to meet him out front, in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got out of the car and said, `Brink, I'm walking again,' ''
Brinkman recalls. ``Then he did a full circle and sat down in his
wheelchair. I got chills.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Jones says she can live with whatever lies in store.
</P>
<P>
   ``John feels somewhat guilty that he's walking and others in his
condition are not,'' she says. ``But he was given a gift, for
whatever reason. And he worked so hard to earn it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilpatrick, headed for Suffolk Law School this fall, says his
goals are to drive a car and get back on skates this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he drives,'' growls his stepfather, ``it had better be a
Humvee.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Glenn won't predict how much bigger the miracle gets. But,
he says, alluding to Gilpatrick's growing self-sufficiency, ``the
one I feel worst for is the dog.''

THE SOULS OF REPUBLICRATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Political experts say third parties cannot win the White House.
Those experts have been on another planet.
</P>
<P>
   The past eight years have seen the White House occupied by the
Republicratic Party, the party of genetically engineered Democrats
who preach compassion on Monday, deliver the death penalty and the
developed world's highest incarceration rates on Tuesday, promise
education on Wednesday, proliferate weapons on Thursday, bask in a
boom economy on Friday, eliminate welfare on Saturday and rest on
Sunday, smugly celebrating their diverse cobweb of optionless black
and brown voters, fickle white voters, flourishing corporate
donations, and unfettered free trade with a regard for human rights
that is good only if you compare it to the Republicans, who have
none at all.
</P>
<P>
   This was the world Bill Clinton gave us for two elections, and
now Al Gore wants America to vote Republicratic a third consecutive
time. As if being Clinton's vice president was not enough, Gore
made sure we all understood the deal by choosing as his running
mate Joseph Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday Lieberman supports Democratic core issues like
abortion rights. On Tuesday, Lieberman supports the vote by white
Californians to kill affirmative action and was prepared to vote
Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court until the Anita Hill story
broke. On Wednesday, Lieberman appears before labor groups. On
Thursday, he chairs the Democratic Leadership Council.
</P>
<P>
   The centrist-to-conservative council has sought now for a decade
to distance the Democratic Party from social issues _ particularly
those even remotely identified with black people _ and toward an
Alan Greenspan obsession with money markets. Since Lieberman became
the chair of the DLC in 1995, the organization has received,
according to this week's Newsweek, $500,000 from cancerous Philip
Morris. Last year, oil giants ARCO and Chevron and drug baron Merck
gave the DLC between $50,000 and $100,000. Chevron is under charges
of using the Nigerian military to flush poverty-stricken protesters
off a rig in 1998. The military shot and killed two protesters.
</P>
<P>
   With Gore's family holding between $500,000 and $1 million in
Occidental oil stocks, any debates between the camps may be less
about polluting Republicans vs. nonpolluting Democrats than between
the interests of Texas oil vs. the interests of California oil.
</P>
<P>
   We all know that Gore picked Lieberman to avoid being attacked
for Clinton's moral failings. But the notion that the Republicrats
would extend an olive branch this sweet to fence-stradding voters
in the form of Lieberman carries centrist politics to a laughable
extreme.
</P>
<P>
   While a lot of ultra-loyal and optionless Democrats _ black
folks and women _ had to smile through gnashed teeth over yet
another white-male ticket, arch-conservative Jerry Falwell, who
supported apartheid in South Africa, said Lieberman was an
``excellent choice.'' Republican New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, who swears he has never seen a case of police brutality
in his life, said Lieberman is ``a very, very good man.'' Senate
majority leader Trent Lott, who has a dubious history of homophobic
statements and alliances with racist political activists, said
Lieberman is ``among our favorite Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this is to suggest that Lieberman is kinfolk to these
vile politicians. For instance, the Republicrats would make far
better appointments to the Supreme Court than Bush and Cheney. But
the problem for Gore and Lieberman is, after expending so much time
and energy trying to grow this particular olive branch of
acceptability to conservatives, whether they have enough fertilizer
left to excite the average voters across the board.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had enough for two terms. With his ambidextrous
charisma, he booted out a successful Republican Gulf War president
while implementing economic policies no Republican is actually
ashamed of, and implemented them even as convinced core Democrats
he was doing the best he could on social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman so far have displayed no such charisma. That
will make it very tough against a Bush who, by merely uttering the
words ``education'' already has a stunning lead among white
suburban women. When you play the politics of similarity, rather
than difference, you need a trump card.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had one. Unless Gore and Lieberman find one, what they
want is improbable, if not impossible. On Monday they call
themselves Democrats. On Tuesday, they are trying to
out-Republicans the Republicans. The Republicans know what they are
about. What happens on Wednesday, Thursday, and beyond depends on
whether Gore and Lieberman can do what Clinton did, convince the
nation they have a soul, while selling out large chunks of the soul
of the Democratic Party all the while.

 HE'S ROWING TO EXTREMES  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARNOLD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ESSEX, Mass. _ Tom Mailhot, who plans to race across the
Atlantic Ocean in a rowboat roughly the length of a large canoe,
was sanding the unfinished hull of his plywood craft the other
night when a moment of introspection stopped him.
</P>
<P>
   It should be pointed out that Mailhot, 40, does not stop easily.
</P>
<P>
   He has paddled kayaks through gales off Cape Horn, giant
whirlpools in the Bay of Funday, 30-foot curling seas in the
Bearing Straight. Mailhot expects next year's transatlantic race to
be so rough that he and his rowing partner, John Zeigler, 50, are
padding the boat's watertight sleeping cubby with foam to minimize
injury when waves spin them like a rinse cycle. They may also
install seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   But at this moment, Mailhot had been stilled by a one-word
question: Why?
</P>
<P>
   After a long pause, he answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do it because I'm a survivor. And when you're a survivor,
you keep the challenges coming.''
</P>
<P>
   No question about it _ this time, Mailot's got himself a
whopper.
</P>
<P>
   Mailhot, of Ipswich, and Zeigler from River Edge, N.J., are the
only Americans entered in a race that on Oct. 7, 2001, will launch
49 pairs of rowers 3,000 miles from Tenerife in the Canary Islands
off Africa's coast to Barbados in the Caribbean. They will race
identical rowboats constructed from kits the racers purchased from
the British race organizer.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Chay Blyth has struck again.
</P>
<P>
   Blyth is the former British Army sergeant who has made a
business of extreme adventure contests. He has sent fleets of
identical sailboats hurtling around the world ``the wrong way'' _
against the prevailing winds _ with crews that pay tens of
thousands of dollars to compete and get beaten up by Mother Nature.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Blyth, who 11 years earlier had rowed across the
Atlantic with a partner himself, sponsored the first transatlantic
rowing race. Thirty crews _ none from the United States _ started;
24 crews finished, their times at sea ranging from 41 to 100 days.
Although the first tropical storm hit the man-powered fleet several
days out of Tenerife, there were no serious injuries reported.
</P>
<P>
   The 2001 Ward Evans Atlantic Rowing Challenge (the British
sponsor, perhaps appropriately, sells insurance) will begin with 50
boats. Each one started as 200 laser-cut pieces of marine plywood
that competitors bought for $3,800 _ after they ponied up the
$19,000 entry fee. Glued together, the pieces resemble a
1,650-pound hot dog some 23 feet long and 6 feet wide.
</P>
<P>
   But the kits don't include required extras: two rowing stations,
each with seats on slides; a solar-powered desalinator to make sea
water drinkable; a host of emergency gear including beacons,
flares, life rafts, and radios; and enough food for each rower to
burn an estimated 8,000 calories _ three to four times the norm _
daily for 100 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figure that by the time we've equipped and shipped our
boat, we'll be about $140,000 into this thing,'' said Mailhot, who
expects to launch the rowboat next month from the Essex
Shipbuilding Museum, which has donated a boat house for the
assembly. The project has been funded with private donations and
T-shirt sales on a Web site (www.usrowboys.com).
</P>
<P>
   Mailhot, who is single, is a designer and project manager for
Treehouse Design, a Rockport architectural firm. Zeigler, the
father of two teenagers, is a food wholesaler who described himself
during a telephone interview as coming off a marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose this race is a kind of mid-life crisis thing,'' said
Zeigler. ``It has adventure, some risk, but after all the time
we've put into the boat (an estimated 300 hours), I'm really
beginning to trust it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mailhot and Zeigler each have won numerous canoe, kayak, and
rowboat races, most recently as the team that swept the pack in the
21-mile Blackburn Challenge that circumnavigates Cape Ann. They
plan to row to Barbados in two-hour shifts, one man rowing, one man
sleeping, 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   After subtracting storage space aboard the yet-unnamed rowboat,
the men will share quarters roughly equivalent to the interior of a
compact car for perhaps two months _ maybe longer.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone have any pet peeves exacerbated by the other?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask me when it's over,'' said Mailhot.

 INJURED HOCKEY PLAYER JOHN GILPATRICK IS A MIRACLE WALKER  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH P. KAHN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, Mass. _ This is John Gilpatrick's life now, a handful
of days after the former Suffolk University hockey player revealed
his remarkable comeback from a spinal cord injury that put him in a
wheelchair 4 1/2 years ago:
</P>
<P>
   At a therapy session at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital,
Gilpatrick wills his legs to stay upright as he negotiates a set of
floor cushions _ tentatively, like a surfer balancing on a steep
wave face. A physical therapist holds his hips while Gilpatrick
tries to remain vertical. Shiftng onto his back, he does knee bends
as his stepfather, Allan Jones, blinks back tears. Petrocino
suggests a water break.
</P>
<P>
   Although he cannot perspire on account of his injury _
Gilpatrick's brawny body lacks a working thermostat _ he refuses
the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no-break therapy,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And this is another part of Gilpatrick's life, in the brief time
since the 27-year-old law student and assistant hockey coach
demonstrated to family and friends _ and skeptical doctors _ that
miracles do happen, especially if you work at them.
</P>
<P>
   A Fox Net Sports reporter stands a few feet away, saying that
what Gilpatrick faces today is ``more challenging than any college
hockey practice'' as the camera zeroes in on him. Dissatisfied with
his delivery, the reporter smooths his hair and signals for another
take. And then another.
</P>
<P>
   If you are John Gilpatrick, this is the product of four years of
hard work and blind faith. Knee bends one moment, a ``Today'' show
interview the next. Calls and e-mail pouring in from around the
country. Reporters showing up at rehab to do play-by-play.
</P>
<P>
   Al Michaels made the line ``Do you believe in miracles?'' a part
of hockey history, and now Gilpatrick is living it. He's the new
gold-medalist of feel-good: Christopher Reeve in the Super Bowl ad
in which he walks again through the magic of digital technology.
Only these special effects are real.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody could have scripted this. Nobody knows, either, how the
next act turns out. Yet everybody around him says that if anyone
was going to beat the odds, it would be Gillie.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the chance to walk again was a matter of when, not
if,'' says Gilpatrick in an interview at the family home in
Hanover. ``Not a miracle, more like a long shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Jones, his mother, won't rule out the miracle scenario,
however. She remembers driving to Boston City Hospital the night of
John's injury, taking one look at the crowd of parents and players
outside in the waiting room emergency room, and expecting to be
told that her son was dead. Walk again? How long do they make long
shots, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   ``The line between optimism and denial, I stopped walking that a
long time ago,'' Jones confesses. ``John always felt optimistic,
but I gave up around the third year on his ever walking again. You
alter your life to be one way, that's all you can do. Our attitude
was, we're fine with this. He's doing well in school. He's got
great friends. He'll be all right.
</P>
<P>
   ``John never gave up,'' she repeats. ``I had. Did he sense that?
Probably. But John is, ah, unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They say lightning never strikes twice, but you could not prove
that by Gilpatrick's star-crossed hockey career.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, while playing goalie for Hanover High School,
Gilpatrick was blindsided by another player. He broke his neck and
sustained a severe concussion, losing feeling in both arms yet
miraculously (that word again) not suffering any permanent
paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   He was, however, hospitalized for two months and told he might
not _ indeed, probably should not _ play hockey again. It took four
operations to repair the damage, including one to implant a pair of
steel stabilizing hooks in his spine. Doctors at one point inserted
a central line and pump in his chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't watch, but John never even blinked when they opened
him up,'' says his stepfather, a retired policeman. ``He went to
his school prom with that central line in.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury devastated Gilpatrick even more because he'd been a
rink rat all his young life. Growing up in the heyday of the
suburban hockey boom of the 1970s, Gilpatrick started skating when
he was in preschool. By 6, he was playing organized hockey; by 11,
he was going off to specialized goalie camps. John's father, Jim
Gilpatrick, had been a star athlete at Arlington High. All four
sons _ John, the youngest, was a toddler when his parents divorced
_ loved sports, too, yet none was more dedicated than John.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was mostly the competition I loved,'' he reflects, sitting
in the family living room next to Ice, his Rottweiler that is
specially trained to assist quadriplegics. Scattered throughout the
house are trophies and photos and autographed NHL hockey jersies
commemorating Gilpatrick's bond with the hockey community, from the
pros to the peewees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had that competitive mentality,'' he continues.
``My heroes were sports stars, hockey players. But not the flashy
skaters, you know. I like the blue-collar guys.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother, herself a hockey nut, remembers John eating supper
in the car every night during hockey season. ``He thought it was
normal for a kid to eat that way,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Brinkman grew up with Gilpatrick. As aggressive as John was
on the ice, says Brinkman, away from the game he was a popular,
low-key, unselfish sort of guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody liked him, not just the jocks,'' says Brinkman.
``Even after the first injury, John was always smiling, always
asking you how you were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The first injury cost Gilpatrick a shot at big-time college
hockey, but there was no qustion in his mind that he would play
hockey again as soon as he was physically able. Taking up karate
even helped sharpen his reflexes once he resumed playing his senior
year.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly he was just a regular guy, those close to Gilpatrick say.
He worked after school for an electrical contracting firm, had no
steady girlfriend, and had to work hard to earn decent grades.
</P>
<P>
   He chose Suffolk and its Division 3 hockey program because he
was confident he could play there. Brian Horan, then the school's
assistant coach, never heard Gilpatrick talk about his
sophomore-year injury. To Horan, who would later hire Gilpatrick as
his assistant, he was a hard-working kid whom teammates and coaches
liked and admired. ``John played the game in his head before he
actually played it on the ice,'' says Horan.
</P>
<P>
   Gilpatrick's life was shattered once again on Jan. 25, 1996,
during a game at Boston University's Brown Arena. Three months
before, BU freshman Travis Roy had broken his neck in the same rink
during his very first college hockey game. With that tragedy still
fresh in the minds of hockey fans everywhere, Gilpatrick _ now
playing center for Suffolk _ took the ice. Midway through the third
period, he was skating full speed toward the goal when he and an
opponent collided. Gilpatrick hit the crossbar, his head snapping
back in a violent whiplash motion. He crumpled to the ice and
stayed there, motionless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked down and knew it was bad,'' says Horan, who ran to
the player's side and held his hand. ``I was just as scared as he
was. But in the ambulance on the way to the hospital he kept
reassuring me it would be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilpatrick sustained what is known as central cord syndrome _
not a severed cord but one injured severely enough to render his
arms and torso useless. Gilpatrick's legs still worked, but he had
no way to control utilize them _ a reality he faced daily during
years of physical therapy.

 HE'S THE DOMINICANS' HERO ON THE R.I. BALLOT  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He looked into the eyes of strangers, in a city 1,500 miles
away, a long-shot wannabe congressman short on cash. But at this
fundraiser in Miami, Angel Taveras stood before his people, meaning
he could forget _ for now _ being an everyman politican.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dominicano soy,'' Taveras bellowed. ``I am Dominican.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing lyrics from merengue crooner Fernandito Villalona,
Taveras continued, as the throngs of Dominican-Americans jumped to
their feet: ``I will never forget my roots. No matter how high I
climb, I will not forget my people!''
</P>
<P>
   In an instant, that Saturday in July, checkbooks flipped open.
Money poured into his campaign chest, adding to the thousands he's
gotten from fundraisers in Washington; New Jersey; New York.
</P>
<P>
   Taveras's face has been splashed on the front-page of newspapers
in the Dominican Republic. He's a household name among Dominicans
living in the United States. As the first Dominican-American to run
for Congress, he's hailed as the Great Dominican Hope.
</P>
<P>
   Back in his home state of Rhode Island, though, Taveras seems a
different man. There, outside of the small, but fast growing
Dominican community, he's relatively unknown and is said to have
little chance of winning the September 12 primary.
</P>
<P>
   Here, he does not shout ``Dominicano soy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a Latino candidate. I am not a Dominican candidate,''
he says with passion. ``I want to represent all people.''
</P>
<P>
   When Portugese-Americans ask, ``Taveras? Are you Portugese?'' he
tells them, with a wink, ``Of course.'' And if an Italian-American
asks the same question, he conjures similiar replies.
</P>
<P>
   Taveras said he doesn't change his persona to fit the audience,
but he knows he can't afford to come across as too Latino.
Hispanics make up just 5.1 percent of the district, with Dominicans
being a 1.6 percent chunk; plus they comprise an even lower
percentage of voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being latino has been an issue that continues to come up,''
Taveras said. ``I'm always concerned that people are going to box
me in. I am proud of my heritage and I wouldn't change that for
anything in the world. But I am much more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Providence, and New York City, Dominicans are the
single largest incoming immigrant group. And they are the fastest
growing, too. In New York City, more Dominican babies were born
last year than any other ethnic group, according to tabulations by
the Dominican Studies Institute at the City College of New York.
</P>
<P>
   But Dominicans, as a bloc, do not vote in large numbers. Though
they contribute heavily to politicians in the homeland, they're
just beginning to use their growing wealth on US candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Dominicans raised $50,000 last October during two days of
fundraising in Greater Boston for Hipolito Mejia, who won the
presidency in the Dominican Republic. Scores of Dominican
immigrants flew from East Coast cities to the island on election
day to vote in the presidential elections. Mejia's party, the
Dominican Revolutionary Party, has a store-front headquarters in
Boston's Jamaica Plain neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   When Taveras speaks to other Dominicans, he scolds them, tells
them they can no longer focus just on homeland politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``People know more about politics back home than they do here,''
Taveras said. ``They can tell you in a second who is the vice
president of the Dominican Republic, but they can't always name the
vice president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Taveras spends most of his days traveling through Rhode Island's
Second Congressional district. As Taveras's campaign becomes a
rising call for Dominicans throughout the United States, the total
amount of out-of-state donations has edged out in-state
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   His last filing with the Federal Elections Commission shows 83
percent of donations came from outside Rhode Island. Just $1,045
came from his state, compared to $6,230 from New Jersey and $3,550
from New York. He's raised $120,000 so far, a quarter of the amount
of the candidate with the largest campaign chest.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction to his campaign has been jolting.
</P>
<P>
   Mejia called Taveras at home to invite him to his inauguration.
Spanish-language newspapers throughout the East Coast have run
profiles. Dominican Festivals, including one in Boston next month,
invite him to be a guest speaker. Strangers _ all of them Latino,
most of them Dominican _ plan fundraisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't expecting this outpouring,'' Taveras said.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Taveras, Dominican-Americans are running for the
Rhode Island State Senate, and for two seats in the New York State
Assembly. Backers give an almost knee-jerk embrace to the
candidates, because they so desperately want someone of their own
in office, any office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited because this kid, he's the future,'' said
entrepreneur Tony Barros of Jamaica Plain, a Dominican-American who
is one of Boston's most politically-connected Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   Taveras, who turns 30 next month, believes he can win. That's
because his whole life has been a crap shoot: raised by a single
mother in one of Providence's poorest neighborhoods, attended
public schools. Partly due to his mother's influence, and his shy,
bookish persona, he attended Harvard, then Georgetown Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, he wore ``Steve Urkel'' glasses _ the name of the
nerdy character on the TV sitcom ``Family Matters.'' But he's
traded those in for Ralph Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   If his corporate attire gives one impression, his taste in music
and food, reveals another. He keeps the merengue music in his
mother's forest green Comanche playing. He comes home to a
Dominican meal every night, that his girlfriend, who is also
Dominican, prepares. He says he can never get enough deep-fried
chicken with heaps of pink beans on white rice.
</P>
<P>
   When he's on the phone with a non-Latino he uses his
Yankee-inflected voice. But if he's talking to another Latino, he
gives warm greetings like, ``Hola, hermano'' (hello, brother), all
in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Just the other day, as he was making a round of calls, asking
for support, he reached a Latino attorney in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like, `You're the one! I heard of you,' '' Taveras
recounted. Before they hung up, he told him he would send him a
check.
</P>
<P>
   Another $200. More outside money for the Dominican underdog.

<TEXT>
<P>
   EPPING, N.H. _ If ever there was a group of artists caught
flat-footed by the arrival of fame, it is the Shaggs, who have
taken to holding their meetings with industry people at the Dunkin'
Donuts off Route 125 in Epping.
</P>
<P>
   They file in from the parking lot locked in discussion of a
broken gas gauge, ordinary small-town moms in shorts and tank tops.
It was here, not so long ago, that they met with an envoy from Tom
Cruise's division of Paramount, and not far from here that they
opted to refuse his pitch in favor of another studio's. The Wiggins
_ once shy, rural girls who played their strange pop music for
derisive locals _ have sold the film rights to their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Dot, Helen, and Betty Wiggin had walked away from the Shaggs
without a backward glance in 1975, when their father and fanatical
promoter, Austin, died. But while they retreated into private
lives, their albums were spreading among underground musicians as a
classic of staggering do-it-yourself discord. Then, last November,
for the first time, their world intersected with their fan base.
Venturing onto a New York stage with their hearts in their throats,
they faced a crowd of hipsters who knew their songs better than
they did. One fan, a man from Los Angeles, had art from their album
cover tattooed on his leg.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the sisters have had the strange experience of
getting to know their own cult following. And they are making a
serious effort to understand the appeal of their music.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the sincere part, and the honest _ at least that's what
they say, the sincere and the honest, and the family part,'' said
Dot Wiggin Semprini, 52, a mother of two and part-time housecleaner
whose recent musical career has been limited to a church handbell
choir.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't somebody say innocent, or something?'' said Betty
Wiggin Porter, 49, who works as a group manager in a kitchen
equipment warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the word I was looking for,'' said her sister.
``Innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are some of the nicer words that have been used to
describe the Shaggs' music. When they recorded ``Philosophy of the
World'' in 1969, the three sisters had had relatively little
musical instruction and asked their father to put off recording
until they were ready, but Austin Wiggin insisted. The album that
resulted is dissonant, arrhythmic and jarring from start to finish
_ a surreal contrast to naive lyrics like these from ``Who Are
Parents?'': Parents are the ones who really care/ Who are parents?/
Parents are the ones who are always there.
</P>
<P>
   The listener gets the impression that the artists are not only
unschooled in the techniques of conventional pop music, but that
they have never been allowed to hear it. Over the years, reviewers
have called the album ``stunningly awful,'' ``uncivilized,'' and,
in the New York Times, ``the best worst rock album ever made.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Village Voice critic Lester Bangs likened Dorothy's
guitar playing to ``14 pocket combs being run through a moose's
dorsal'' and Helen's drumming to ``a peg-leg stumbling through a
field of bald Uniroyals.''
</P>
<P>
   But to a network of musical explorers desperate to shake
conventional influences, the Wiggins' nerve-jangling quality was
like catnip. Kurt Cobain, the lead singer of Nirvana who committed
suicide in 1994, was said to have listened to ``Philosophy of the
World'' as a ritual every morning. Downtown filmmaker Harmony
Korine, best known for the film ``Kids,'' paid homage by naming
characters in ``Gummo'' after the Wiggin sisters. Breathless Web
sites devoted to the Shaggs have sprung up like mushrooms, praising
``the spastic magic in these grooves'' and saluting the sisters'
``pure desire and drive. No talent necessary . . . . This is what
punk is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   All this has caused some bafflement in Fremont, where the Shaggs
played through the early '70s. The girls' father, a textile worker,
had pulled them out of the local high school so they could focus on
their music, which he felt was destined to make them famous. Jeff
Landrock, who was a sound engineer at the Fleetwood Studio in
Revere, Mass., where they recorded their second album in 1975,
recalled the girls' frozen looks when their father brought them
into the studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of weird,'' he said. ``They didn't say anything.
There was zero personality. It kind of looked like they didn't want
to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Their primary venue was Fremont Town Hall, where the fire chief,
Dick Heselton, 54, used to guard their Saturday night concerts for
$5 a night. Heselton remembered their music as ``rotten . . . (but)
catchy at times'' and said he chose to stand guard outside. Dick
Maloof, 54, said he has never developed a taste for the music, but
has watched the ebb and flow of ``Shagg-mania'' for the 30 years
he's lived here.
</P>
<P>
   ``These fans, I don't think they're people from Fremont who are
lining up to see them,'' Maloof said. ``All I can understand is
there's something about the lyrics to the songs, people think
they're Bob Dylanish or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of this sense of mystery is shared by the former Shaggs
themselves, who so thoroughly walked away from pop music that until
last year, many of their friends didn't know they had ever played
instruments. A fourth sister, Rachel Wiggin (now Gould), who
occasionally joined her older sisters on bass, kept her distance
from the band when other high school students teased her about the
music. Fred Semprini, who married Dorothy Wiggin, used to badger
his wife to play her album, but she would not allow it on the
stereo while she was in the house.
</P>
<P>
   But the reissue of ``Philosophy of the World'' last year, urged
by Terry Adams, keyboardist for the band NRBQ, set off a chain of
events that culminated in a bidding war over the film rights to
their life stories. At Adams's urging, Semprini and Porter agreed
to get up on stage at the Bowery Ballroom in New York last
November, although Helen Wiggin Bickford, who suffers from
depression, was not able to join them. The sisters signed
autographs for upward of an hour that night, and since then have
made contacts with a line of famous rock musicians without knowing
precisely who they are.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Shaggs' most evangelical promoters, for instance, was
Frank Zappa, who called ``Philosophy of the World'' ``better than
the Beatles.'' In a recent interview, Semprini asked a reporter if
Zappa's music could be described as ``heavy metal,'' and racked her
brain for the name of a bass player who had befriended her.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that band? RMB?'' she asked, and finally came up with
REM.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't he the one who helped me get onto that high stool?''
asked their mother, Annie Wiggin, 73. ``He just picked me up and
stuck me on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Semprini laughed. ``I didn't know REM,'' she said. ``But they
knew us.''
</P>
<P>
   And they are rapidly becoming familiar with the entertainment
business. Since a magazine article last year sparked interest from
the film industry, the sisters have bolstered their flanks with two
new lawyers, one a film and movie specialist and one a music lawyer
who is helping them trace the rights to songs they had long ago
forgotten about. Several months ago, they opted to sell the rights
to their life stories to Artisan Entertainment, an independent film
company specializing in edgy projects like the upcoming ``Blair
Witch 2: Book of Shadows'' and John Waters's ``Cecil B. DeMented.''
According to Artisan, production on the film will begin early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Semprini said the sisters have not made any profit from the
revival of interest in them, and only stand to do so if the movie
plans are realized.
</P>
<P>
   But even if they are, artists like the Shaggs will never really
be part of the world that embraces them, said Irwin Chusit, who
showcased the band in his new book ``Songs in the Key of Z: The
Curious Universe of Outsider Music.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of being an outsider is you're not really going to
change _ I don't mean this in a demeaning way, but kind of like the
Beverly Hillbillies,'' he said. ``If the Shaggs go to Hollywood
they could go to every A-list party in the Hills and meet David
Geffen and Stephen Spielberg, and they're still going to be
outsiders by nature . . . bless their hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, some have hesitated to bring the sisters into the
public eye because of that. In his book, Chusit recounts a visit to
a mid-1970s Shaggs concert by a Boston music executive who was
interested in arranging live performances or maybe a record deal.
When he arrived at Fremont Town Hall, Harry Palmer found locals
dancing in ``a clumsy, arrhythmic, `Night of the Living Dead' sort
of way,'' and approached Austin Wiggin with a delicate question:
Didn't he understand that there were people who were laughing at
the Shaggs? Finally, Palmer went home without making a deal,
convinced that promoting the Shaggs to the wider public would be
the worst kind of exploitation, since they ``didn't know they were
being ridiculed,'' Chusit wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But 30 years later, the adult Shaggs, who now live in Epping,
seem serene in the face of their detractors: Everyone is entitled
to their opinion, and the true artists all like the music, Semprini
said. Gould, 46, of Maine, who was embarrassed of the band during
her teen years, now says that people who don't like the music
``just don't take the time to understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Wiggin sisters know what their audience is
looking for, and it's not skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want us to be good. They want us to be like we were
on the record,'' said Semprini.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if they could possibly re-create that chaotic sound,
Porter said she supposed they could.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not any better,'' she said, with a tiny smile.

</P>
<P>
   _ Janet Bentley, Roswell, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: The search for your Stella D'oro Anginetti cookies is over.
Metro Atlanta Publix stores (within a 30-mile area of Atlanta) are
stocking these sweet treats (a 5-ounce package is $1.79), which are
light, puffed, sugar-coated cookies used to make cream puffs and
profiteroles. (Recipes for these desserts are on the package.) In a
recent Food section, reader Erma Cavigliano of Hampton told how to
make the cream puffs. Stuff Stella D'oro Anginetti cookies with a
filling made of 1 cup stiff whipped cream, 3 ounces cream cheese
and an 8 1/2-ounce can of crushed pineapple, drained. Blend
ingredients on low speed of a mixer for 3 minutes. Then fill and
chill and enjoy.

   Q: I am looking for 8 3-ply cotton cord or twine in white or
natural. I have looked everywhere, including craft stores, and
would really like to buy a lartile Enterprises, 216 Main St.,
Whitesburg, GA (770-834-2094). It's available in a natural-colored
cotton for $5.32 per 270-foot tube or in a natural/beige cotton for
$5.32 in a 270-foot ball. Reader Davis plans to make a rug with her
cord. Other uses include making handbags, belts and plant hangers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for Lolli-Pups Dog Treats by Pet Life. Kmart
used to carry them. We have not had any luck finding them in pet
stores or on the Internet. Our dogs love them. Please help us to
locate them.

<P>
   _ Jewel Crews, Tucker, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: We sniffed around and found Fido's treats at the Petsmart
location at 3221 Peachtree Road N.E. (404-266-0402). Other Petsmart
stores also carry them. A 12-ounce bag is $1.79. These colorful,
crunchy snacks contain crude protein, fat and fiber.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Last fall my wife and I visited Phoenix and had a fish taco
for the first time. We have since tried in vain to find a Mexican
restaurant in Atlanta that sells these. Can you please help. They
are delicious.
</P>
<P>
   _ Steve Livingston, Decatur, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Sounded fishy to us at first, but we did find your tacos of
choice at Taqueria Del Sol, 1200 Howell Mill Road N.W.
(404-352-5811). One taco is $1.95. These tasty treats are made from
a flour tortilla (certified kosher) that's filled with batter-fried
fish topped with poblano tartar sauce made with jalepenos,
poblanos, mayo and lemon juice. One of the restaurant reviewers at
the Atlanta Journal-Constitution called the tacos ``addictive.''
Owners Mike Klank and Eddie Hernandez also own Sundown Cafe on
Cheshire Bridge Road, where you can chow down on a fish taco as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We are avid bird watchers and feeders. We have used Pine
Haven birdseed from Kroger, and they love it. But the store no
longer carries it. Can you find it for us?
</P>
<P>
   _ Claire Johnson, Powder Springs, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   And another inquiry: Kroger stores used to carry Pine Haven, a
birdseed that was produced in Atlanta by RLM. I can find no
information about the product or its availability. Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Cecil Hudson, Watkinsville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: A little birdie told us where to find your Pine Haven seed.
It's available on the Internet at www.ibackyardbirds.com. Or call
404-255-0110 and order the seed. Three 7.5-pound polyester bags are
$20.97 plus postage. The current mix in Pine Haven contains black
oil sunflower, hulled sunflower, raw peanuts and safflower.
Atlantan Ron Miller, who developed this mixture, says, ``Do not
store birdseed inside your home for any length of time. Instead,
store in galvanized garbage cans in a utility room. Storing the
seed in a warm area over several months will cause moths to appear
in bird food.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget Pokemon and Beanie Babies. A fad that began in Japan and
swept California has finally reached the East Coast and could
become the best-selling toy of the year, retailers say.
</P>
<P>
   The source of this fad? Collapsible, foot-propelled scooters
that sell for $70 to $130.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just children who are gaga over them. With adults
buying the scooters, too, retailers are already racking up big
sales, bracing for December, and wondering whether such an
expensive item can also be a holiday smash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the hot toy of Christmas, only it's here in the
summer,'' said Robin Reibel, a vice president of Filene's.
</P>
<P>
   Sandie Paradiso, a buyer for Learning Express Inc., a chain
based in Ayer, said, ``Based on sales so far, I think it's going to
be the number-one item on kids' Christmas lists.''
</P>
<P>
   The scooter fad may be nearly as hot now as J.K. Rowling's
bestseller, ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest phenomenon since Beanie Babies,'' said
chief executive Robert Hammer of Hammer-Pac Inc., a New York-based
supplier of Razor-brand scooters.
</P>
<P>
   It would be remarkable for a $100 item to be a holiday hit. Past
big sellers such as Tickle-Me-Elmo and Furby sold for about $30. As
Reibel noted, a Razor Scooter isn't something that most folks can
buy ``for every nephew on their holiday gift list.''
</P>
<P>
   But given recent scooter sales and the fact that some experts
see a big holiday for luxury items, many retailers are betting that
scooters will remain hot for another five months.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to novelties, Hammer claims to be a go-to guy.
Mood rings turned his bottom line green in the 1970s, and he says
he had a nice run with ``bubble umbrellas.''
</P>
<P>
   But nothing compares to the Razor Scooter, he said. ``It just
blows out the doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammer said he grasped the megabuck magnitude of the phenomenon
around Father's Day, when Macy's ordered 150 Razors from him. A few
days later, the chain was back wanting 10,000 more, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Razor weighs in at a mere six pounds. Folded up, it can fit
into a knapsack. Deployed for street action, it can turn a
25-minute walk into a 10-minute scoot.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike skateboards or inline skates, the scooters _ there are
several brands besides the Razor _ little skill seems to be
required for basic operation, hence, its popularity with adults.
</P>
<P>
   From Tokyo to New York, there have been numerous sightings of
scooter commuters, folks who use Razors to travel the several
blocks between a subway stop and the office.
</P>
<P>
   The Razor Scooter has ``become an icon of the dot-com world,''
said Tony Farrell of the Sharper Image, a chain based in San
Francisco. ``It's not like a bike. You don't have to lug it and
lock it. And you can carry it to your desk.''
</P>
<P>
   Adults see scooters as a fun form of transportation; children
see them as toys. The result? Strong demand from many age groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharper Image says it was the first US retailer to spot the
scooter's potential, and it gives Razor much of the credit for its
whopping sales gain in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The chain first stocked a noncollapsible scooter in 1998. Early
sales were respectable but not remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, a collapsible Razor Scooter was added to the line.
Sales began to take off in the spring, first in Hawaii, then in
California. About six weeks ago, the scooter became the company's
best-selling item, Farrell said.
</P>
<P>
   The Razor may have a multinational pedigree. According to
Farrell, a company in Taiwan bought the Razor's German design and
now has it mass-produced in Chinese factories.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer thinks a line of accessories will keep the scooter fad
fresh. Coming are running lights, shoulder straps, shock absorbers,
colorful handlebar trims, and wheel treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go to Harvard or Yale, you'll be able to customize your
scooter in your school colors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dartmouth green might work for M.E. Johnson, a professor who
studies the toy industry at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business. He
says that toys that become holiday hits often show the first signs
of catching fire months ahead of time, often in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to build awareness,'' Johnson said. ``And some
scarcity helps. If it's readily available, it's not nearly as
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   After studying Silicon Valley startups while on summer break,
Johnson says scooters have been embraced by dot-com executives.
``It's the kind of thing the boss buys and rides around the office,
and everybody hoots and hollers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While there might be some hooting and hollering over high
prices, the scooter's initial popularity with parents may help make
the Razor a holiday hit.
</P>
<P>
   Past crazes have dismayed some parents. Many toys tied to
television shows and movies have been derided as unwholesome. And
not every mom was comfortable with her 9-year-old putting Mighty
Morphin Power Rangers and Hulk Hogan action figures at the top of a
holiday wish list.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are parents who fret that such items as inline skates
and snowboards may be a hazard to a klutzy child.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, few parents have voiced any concerns about
scooters, said Paradiso of Learning Express. And that's another
sign that this craze may have legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a raging fad,'' said Farrell of the Sharper Image.
``We expect it to be our number-one seller for the holidays.''

DRUG TRIALS BRANCH FROM TEACHING HOSPITALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LIZ KOWALCZYK  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a survivor of two heart-bypass surgeries, Warren McCollester
regularly receives missives from Boston teaching hospitals asking
him to become a human research subject. McCollester, a busy
retiree, can't be bothered and throws the letters into what he
politely calls ``circular file 13.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the family doctor he's known for 25 years out in rural
North Dartmouth, Mass. asked him the same question recently, he
signed right up.
</P>
<P>
   Now, suddenly, he's enrolled in a clinical trial on the front
lines of a gown-to-town experiment by the country's top teaching
hospitals. In an effort to expand their research operations,
hospitals in US cities are moving leading-edge trials testing new
drugs out to doctors' offices in the suburbs, on rural roads, or
simply on the way home from Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   Partners HealthCare, which includes Massachusetts General
Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, is investing
$500,000 over four years to transform community doctors into
part-time researchers. Teaching hospitals in New York City,
Pittsburgh and Rochester, N.Y., are making similar investments.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching hospitals say they want to improve relationships
between academic and community physicians, who have long kept their
distance. But they also are aiming to gain access to thousands of
potential trial participants, a key selling point if they are to
win back $400 billion in research money lost in the past decade to
private industry.
</P>
<P>
   The shift to the suburbs could be a boon for patients, who will
be told about experimental treatments for heart disease,
depression, and diabetes during their regular office check-ups and
can enroll in those trials closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   But in cities where the research shift has been underway for one
to two years, doctors say training inexperienced researchers has
been far more difficult than expected and has raised ethical
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more involved than we ever imagined,'' said Dr.
Cynthia McGuire Dunn, director of the clinical research institute
at the University of Rochester. ``There is a misperception among
doctors out there that doing clinical trials is either an easy way
to get into research or an easy way to earn money. It's neither of
those.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said she's also struggling with the ``reality that doctors
who ask their patients to participate in studies are blurring the
line between researcher and caregiver. The thing volunteers lose
sight of is that trials evaluate how groups respond. They're not
about what's best for that patient.''
</P>
<P>
   To some community doctors, clinical trials are not new. The
companies that oversee trials for pharmaceutical and biotechnology
firms have for several years paid private physicians to recruit
their patients. The companies promise speed and access to large
numbers of volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, teaching hospitals, which once conducted 80 percent
of all clinical trials paid for by industry, now claim just 40
percent of those trials. Ken Getz, a spokesman for Centerwatch, a
publishing company that monitors trials, said the shift has cost
hospitals $400 billion over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've lost tremendous market share,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, there is early evidence that their attempts to
become more business-like is working: This is the first year in a
decade that academic medical centers reported an increase in
dollars coming from private industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing a lot of things their competition is doing,'' he
said. ``They've already got thought leaders and greater access to
patients. If they can get their act together and better manage the
business side, and review contracts and protocols faster, they may
again be one of the best places for pharmaceutical companies to run
research.''
</P>
<P>
   Partners began its program _ called Partners Research and
Education Program _ a year ago to cement the organization's bonds
with the community doctors in its network. So far, they've signed
up 50 community doctors, who've enrolled 70 patients in six trials.
</P>
<P>
   Partners said it's trying to avoid the ethical problems that
have plagued its for-profit competitors, who have been criticized
for paying doctors large sums for each patient they enroll _ even
if the patient is not appropriate for the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Instead Partners pays its physician researchers a fee for each
individual test or exam they perform on a volunteer _ a fee that's
25 to 50 percent higher than what an insurance company would pay
for the same procedure on a regular patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sites aren't geared to be factories,'' said Dr. Marc
Pfeffer, a cardiologist at Brigham &AMP; Women's Hospital and medical
director of PREP. ``Our objective is not to be the highest
enrolling center, but to export some of the excitement to doctors
who are not in the hospital. If we do it well, and we can move
people through the research programs safely, sure, that will give
us a leg up.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first trials Massachusetts General Hospital floated
to community doctors was one comparing the anti-depression
blockbuster Prozac to St. John's Wort and to a placebo. It's $1
million funding comes from the German herbal company that's the
leading maker of St. John's Wort.
</P>
<P>
   The trial requires 180 patients with major depressive disorder,
but after an entire year Massachusetts General researchers had
recruited only 65 volunteers. With a good economy driving down the
number of uninsured, bad publicity about Prozac, and competition
from private trial management companies, the hospital was having
trouble finding willing participants. So in June, it opened the
trial to doctors in eight suburban offices.
</P>
<P>
   The primary-care doctors approach their patients about the
study, and if they are willing to participate and meet the
requirements, an Massachusetts General psychiatrist conducts a
telephone interview. Participants are seen weekly and then every
other week by their regular doctor, who monitors and records their
depression level and any side effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The life of a primary-care physician these days is kind of
rugged,'' said Dr. Jerrold Rosenbaum, chief of psychiatry at
Massachusetts General. ``They move from patient to patient to
patient. It's grueling. Many of them have had frustrated academic
aspirations. This is good for self-esteem and for staying fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Diane London, an internist in Natick, Mass. working on the
depression trial, said it's enabling her to provide better care to
her patients. ``The battery of psychiatric tests we're giving is
not something I would normally do in my practice,'' she said.
``This gives me a chance to delve deeper into a field.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brian Schwartz, an internist and cardiologist in Natick and
a PREP investigator, said he felt he ``needed to do something
besides grind out patients every day.'' But he said he enrolls in
trials only patients for whom ``I feel I have done everything I can
for them with standard treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   It's crucial for physician-investigators to consider what's best
for the patient first, program directors said, because some
patients will enroll in clinical trials just because they trust
their long-time doctor.
</P>
<P>
   McCollester, 76, said that he was in no way pressured by his
physician, Dr. Alex Altschuller, to enroll in a study of a new
heart drug. Doctors are testing whether the drug, trandalopril,
already on the market for high blood pressure, will reduce heart
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But having his doctor of 25 years ask added ``a personal touch''
that made him take the request more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was also intrigued by the fact that he was trying to go out
into smaller towns to find participants, not just the big Boston
hospitals,'' McCollester said. ``The more diversity we get, the
more meaningful the results are going to be to the overall
population.''
</P>
<P>
   While the goal is clear, reaching it is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said researchers at the University of Rochester complained
when she offered trials to community physicians first. Now she
gives the in-town doctors 48 hours to decide whether to participate
in a study before recruiting community physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, she's trying to decide whether investigators should
tell their patients how much they're earning from a trial.
Rochester pays doctors a per-patient fee, ranging from $500 to
$15,000, depending on the complexity of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Duke University has found that certain studies just don't work
out in the community. For example, trials testing drugs for the
flu, sinusitis, or other acute conditions require the hospital's
research coordinators to drop what they're doing and drive to the
doctor's office to interview the patient immediately _ a speedy
response that is not always possible. Duke, like Partners, sends
coordinators to doctors' offices to enroll patients and do the
paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Leahey, director of clinical trials at
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City, said
academic medical centers must solve these problems _ even if it
means losing money in the short term. The medical center has
invested $3 million in his program to turn suburban doctors into
investigators _ and has yet to make any of it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to bring research back where it belongs, to the
nonprofit fold, to where patient safety is more important than
stock dividends,'' he said.

REVOLVER'S DURST OUTBURST; HIP LIST IN REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a guy who might have spent his life asking the seemingly
immortal question, ``Paper or plastic?,'' Fred Durst sure is one
ticked-off dude. You'd think a self-described ``redneck'' who now
hangs with Playboy playmates and makes millions singing ``Break
Stuff'' would spend more time thanking his lucky stars than
swinging at his detractors. But there's Durst, lead singer of
rock-rap band Limp Bizkit, emptying a bellyful of bile in the
current issue of Revolver. While he's certainly combative _ Trent
Reznor, Courtney Love, and Lars ``I Hate Napster'' Ulrich shouldn't
expect any Christmas cards this year _ Durst also comes across as a
rube who relishes his role as spokesguy for the unspecific
frustrations of teenage Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch shoppers. Describing
Limp Bizkit's place in the world, Durst tells writer Matt Diehl
that his band is ``part of a movement that is helping blur the
lines between rock and hip-hop, which, in turn, will pave the road
for generations to come.'' No arguing with him there. But Durst's
ego runs amok when Diehl asks him about why the press seems to hate
him. Durst makes a cringe-inducing comparison between his band and
Martin Luther King (yes, that Martin Luther King) in that King
``came out of the crowd and said, `I'm speaking for you guys _ I'm
one of you.' So many people were there and feeling him, but at the
same time everyone hated him.'' As I recall, King did what he did
so his four children could be judged not by the color of their
skin, but by the content of their character; Durst did it all for
the nookie.
</P>
<P>
   In the same issue, Christopher Scapelliti takes a fascinating
look at Pete Townsend's unfinished rock opera, ``Lifehouse.'' Back
in 1971, Townsend wanted to out-Tommy his first rock opera,
``Tommy,'' but his obsession to create a career-defining work led
him to a breakdown and the brink of suicide. Though it was
bittersweet for Townsend, from the ashes of ``Lifehouse'' came the
Who's great ``Who's Next.'' By the way, after only a few issues,
Revolver is shaping up to be a pretty cool music magazine.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of new magazines, there's Revolution, which fancies
itself as ``the new music manifesto'' _ it says so right on the
cover. That's new music, as in anything that isn't straight-ahead
rock. Revolution is dedicated to the head-boppin', hip-shakin' fool
in us all, especially those who spend their lives looking for the
perfect beat. To wit, there's this cover story: ``The 50 Albums
That Killed Rock, and Got Us Dancing.'' (Betcha thought all those
lists had faded with the millennium madness, didn't you?) As with
any list, there's much to squabble about _ if you're gonna pick a
Donna Summer album, then it should be ``I Remember Yesterday,''
whose classic ``I Feel Love'' is a template of electronic music,
not ``Once Upon a Time.'' But what makes the list fun is that its
creators know their stuff. So while you have the expected (Fatboy
Slim, Pet Shop Boys, Air), hip-hop, which created the DJ culture so
vital to today's dance music, is proudly represented by Run-DMC,
Beastie Boys, A Tribe Called Quest, Public Enemy, and Eric B. &AMP;
Rakim. Yes, kids, once upon a time there was hip-hop you could
actually dance to.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ah, there's track star Marion Jones on the cover of Women's
Sports &AMP; Fitness looking better than you ever will, no matter how
many stomach crunches you do, and how many desserts you don't. In
this issue on all things Olympian, Sally Jenkins looks at
controversy magnet Bela Karolyi, who coached the 1996 US women's
gymnasts to its first team gold. For all his successes, Karolyi is
considered by many to be a strict authoritarian who demands too
much physically and psychologically of his athletes. Mary Lou
Retton, whom Karolyi coached to a gold medal in 1984, recalls him
chiding her with, ``Meddy Loo, is no good what you eat. Makes you
fat. You should only eat air.'' But she also defends Karolyi. ``Is
he strict? Yeah. Does he have a demanding work ethic? Of course.
But you know that going in. He creates champions. You go to him to
come home with a medal.'' That's why Karolyi, who had retired from
elite coaching, will again lead the women's gymnastics team next
month in Sydney. Whatever his problems _ and anyone who tells an
athlete in a sport rife with eating disorders to ``only eat air''
has some problems _ he produces winners. Before Karolyi, US women
gymnasts had won just a single medal; since 1981 when Karolyi
joined the program, they've won 18. And if Karolyi can again spin
his particular magic into Olympic gold, no one will much care what
methods he used to get there.

REFLECTING ON HUMAN SPIRIT AMID LIFE'S LOSSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
BODIES IN MOTION AND AT REST 
On Metaphor and Mortality 
By Thomas Lynch 
Norton, 276 pp., illustrated, $23.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are moments in this wonderful, wise, and witty book that
are the literary equivalent of blows to the stomach _ one is left
gasping for air from words that expose unvarnished, sometimes
painful truths. The heartache of love unraveling, the grief of
watching undertakers remove a dead father from his home, or the
agony of failing to rescue a son.
</P>
<P>
   In eloquent and lyrical prose, Thomas Lynch _ poet, essayist,
and funeral director of Milford, Mich. _ probes the losses we
suffer and the fortitude of the human soul that allows us to climb
out of the deepest well of despair.
</P>
<P>
   But this collection of essays is not just a rumination on the
grim moments of our lives. Lynch roams far afield, writing
passionately on the debt we owe Eve; the hated family cat that
simply would not die; and the coverage of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s
death. Ultimately, ``Bodies in Motion and at Rest'' is a meditation
on the human condition on the threshold of a new millennium, an age
punctuated by immense wealth, dazzling technology, intractable
poverty, and horrific violence.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all this, Lynch astutely observes, ``The facts of life and
death remain the same. We live and die, we love and grieve, we
breed and disappear. And between these existential gravities, we
search for meaning, save our memories, leave a record for those who
will remember us.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes these essays so powerful is that Lynch is unafraid to
admit to his own frailties and failures _ his divorce, his struggle
with liquor. And while we find it easy to deny and deceive, it is,
in the end, the truth that offers the best hope for redemption.
``The truth, even when it hurts, has a healing in it, better than
fiction or fantasy,'' Lynch notes.
</P>
<P>
   So it was one morning at the kitchen table, as a hungover Lynch
prepared breakfast for his three children, that he finally
recognized the damage alcohol had done to him and his family. ``I'm
slamming the apples and cookies in with the bologna sandwiches and
cursing my fates and barking out orders and wondering what a guy
has to do for a drink around here when I see my darling boy who is
nine in this memory sitting at the counter with his bowl of Froot
Loops and orange juice in his blue shirt and the look in his eyes
as he's looking at me is fear, godhelpus, and he is afraid of me,
of my anger and of my fear. I didn't know if I was an alcoholic.
But I knew that I didn't want to see that fear of me again in the
eyes of any of my children.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch eventually joined Alcoholics Anonymous and ``in time I
went from dry to sober.'' But because life doesn't furnish tidy,
happy endings, Lynch must grapple with the fact that his son is
also sliding into alcoholism. As Lynch sadly describes, few things
are more devastating than being unable to save one's children from
self-destruction. Lynch finds an adolescent treatment center in
Cleveland; the son says he'll kill himself first. ``I said he was
killing himself already. . . . I said if he killed himself I would
miss him terribly, I would never forget him and always love him and
I'd hate to outlive him but I'd survive. And I'd call someone
before I'd drink about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of his shrewder essays, Lynch dissects our media-fed
hunger to be a part of public tragedies, from the deaths of
Princess Diana and JFK Jr. to the massacre at Columbine High
School. ``Tragedy-cam and Grief TV,'' he observes, give us the
chance to share in national mourning and healing from the comfort
of our couches, without our having to come face-to-face with the
bereaved. ``But every sadness does not belong to everyone,'' he
continues, and this mass sadness is not the same as true grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grief is the tax we pay on our attachments, not on our
interests or diversions or entertainments,'' Lynch writes. ``We
grieve for losses only in games we play for keeps _ real love, real
hate, real attachments broken. Perhaps if we were more willing to
leave ourselves open to grief _ deregulated, unplanned, unruly,
potentially embarrassing grief _ and bear its burdens honorably,
we'd have less free-floating, unattached heartache to spend on the
increasingly `packaged' bereavement-ops the media serves up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, what unifies this compilation as it meanders among
such disparate topics is Lynch's lust for life in all its splendor
and torment. ``Someone told me that I should just say `Thanks,' and
that all my prayers should begin that way and never stray far from
the notion that life was a gift to be grateful for,'' he writes. As
someone who has made his living dealing with the end of life, Lynch
has earned that particular wisdom.

RUSSIA AGREES TO ACCEPT HELP FROM BRITAIN FOR SUBMARINE RESCUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By SABRINA TAVERNISE and PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Russian navy agreed Wednesday to accept help from
Britain to rescue more than 100 crew members trapped aboard a
crippled nuclear-powered submarine that lies on the floor of the
Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Russian rescuers made two attempts on Tuesday, two overnight and
at least one Wednesday morning to attach a rescue capsule to the
submarine Kursk. The navy planned to make one more attempt.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russian efforts seemed to be at a pause as rescuers
regrouped, strategized and waited for the arrival of a British
mini-submarine to help with the rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin made his first public comments on the
disaster Wednesday, saying the situation was critical. Putin's
strong language and the decision to accept British help after days
of refusing proffers of aid indicates that the Russians are running
out of technological options and perhaps beginning to despair.
</P>
<P>
   It may be difficult for the British or anyone else to aid the
rescuers. The seas are high, the water bitterly cold and the
underwater currents strong and unpredictable. A further
complication is that the submarine is listing at a 60-degree angle,
making it difficult for any rescue capsule, pod or vehicle to
connect with it.
</P>
<P>
   The British rescue submarine arrived in Trondheim, Norway, from
Scotland on Wednesday. It must be shipped by boat to the site of
the accident, about 35 miles off the Russian coast. But it is
unclear whether the British craft can make it to the accident site
in time.
</P>
<P>
   The crew of the Russian submarine had been beating out an SOS
code on the hull, but the Russian news agency Interfax reported
that the taps had stopped, according to Deputy Prime Minister Ilya
Klebanov.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the silence of the crew, which has had no radio
contact since the accident on Saturday, did not necessarily mean
that the sailors were dead. He said they might be trying to
conserve their energy and oxygen, now that they have been alerted
that rescue efforts are underway.
</P>
<P>
   Information about what happened remains fragmentary and often
contradictory. The Kursk was apparently damaged by an explosion and
partly flooded on Saturday during training maneuvers by Russia's
Northern Fleet. The damage was likely compounded by the crash
landing of the 14,000-ton sub on the bottom of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   After examining the outside of the submarine, navy officials
said the most likely reason for the accident was an explosion,
possibly from a torpedo carried in the front of the vessel. The
Russian government at first said the accident occurred on Sunday,
but U.S. officials have said U.S. Navy submarines detected the
sound of an explosion on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   And news reports from Russia have been misleading and inaccurate
at times. On Wednesday the navy raised the official count of the
number of crew members from 116 to 118.
</P>
<P>
   During much of Tuesday, rescue efforts were hampered by winds
that reached 45 miles an hour and whipped up waves of 13 feet.
Water temperatures near the submarine hovered at 39 degrees.
Visibility under water was extremely low, the navy said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have been trying to use at least two small
bell-shaped rescue capsules, each able to hold 10 to 20 people, to
reach the crew.

 &HT;    Hitmaker Messina turns up the heat
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With her third CD, this Boston tomboy proves she is the female
vocalist destined to keep alive the working class spunk of Loretta
Lynn. As much as the stylists pile on the makeup for glam album
covers, Messina's powerful voice and take-no-bull lyrics break
through the makeover to stand up consistently for all the gals who
work two jobs and buy their cosmetics at Wal-Mart. In the giddy,
driving-around anthem ``Saturday Night,'' Messina hops into Mary's
Mustang with the naive passion of a small-town girl looking for her
dreams under a neon sign. The title track is a scorching ultimatum
to a mixed-up lover _ ``Be anyone you want to be/but I want
something in return/I want you to burn.'' The duet with producer
Tim McGraw, ``Bring on the Rain,'' layers a mournful cello over an
anthem of survival and beating hard times that rivals Scarlett
O'Hara holding her fist in the air. Throughout the CD, McGraw's
signature sounds _ soaring guitar solos, monster truck rhythms _
are fine tools that complement Messina's stunning (and refreshingly
country) voice. Though the tunes are slightly less consistent than
her last CD, Messina proves here she's not just a hitmaker, but a
career artist.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sick of ``Survivor?'' Bored since the beginning of ``Big
Brother?'' Rather give away all your money than watch another
episode of ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire''? Well, have hope. The
new TV season is on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   My company, Youth Intelligence, recently conducted focus groups
with teens and 20-somethings in New York, L.A. and Chicago to see
which of this seasons new shows they preferred. One caveat _ our
savvy viewers were hesitant to cast votes based only on previews or
pilot episodes. Even THEY know that a shows success has much to do
with great scripts, good time slots and the support of its network.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the ones that seem to have what it takes to make a hit:
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON PUBLIC (Fox) _ If this series creates half as much buzz
as its executive producer David E. Kelley's prior hits, ``Ally
McBeal'' and ``The Practice,'' you'll want to make sure you're home
at 8 p.m. (EST)on Monday nights.
</P>
<P>
   This drama centers around a group of young teachers working at a
New England high school. Teens liked the idea of an accurate,
albeit exaggerated representation of high school life, while
20-somethings loved the idea of a high school where teachers were
dedicated to teaching. The lead actress, Jessalyn Gilsig, is
already being touted as the next Calista Flockhart.
</P>
<P>
   TUCKER (NBC) _ This sitcom may be ``The Wonder Years'' for
Generation Why. It has everything _ a dysfunctional family,
pubescent situations, a girl-next-door crush, thoughtful voiceovers
and a realistic setting. The show is an edgy, coming-of-age comedy
about a 14-year-old boy, Tucker, and his struggles to start a new
life with his aunt's crazy family. Katie Segal of ``Married With
Children'' plays Tucker's aunt, and the Fred Savage-esque Tucker is
a charmer. If you've ever been 14, you should be able to relate.
</P>
<P>
   THE $TREET (Fox) _ This show, which is set in a high-powered
Wall Street brokerage firm, capitalizes (pardon the pun) on the
current attention being paid to stocks and trading. Young TV
viewers are themselves playing the market, day-trading, starting
companies and developing portfolios _ so ``The $treet'' may well
have tapped into the right theme at the right time. With a cast
that includes Christian Campbell (``Trick''), Adam Goldberg
(``Saving Private Ryan''), Tom Everett Scott (``Boiler Room'') and
Jennifer Connelly (``Inventing the Abbots''), this show could be a
winner.
</P>
<P>
   QUEER AS FOLK (Showtime) _ Based on the British television
series of the same name, ``Queer as Folk'' is a risque drama about
homosexual life. The original series was highly controversial
because of its frequent nudity and edgy subject matter. Showtimes
series deals with the lives of a group of gay men in a
working-class city in the eastern United States. Young people
applauded Showtimes willingness to handle a controversial subject.
</P>
<P>
   THE FUGITIVE (CBS) _ Although this series has a tough act to
follow _ no one I know would want to follow Harrison Ford! _ ``The
Fugitive'' has a production team that may help it live up to the
film's legacy. In fact, some of our younger panelists didnt even
realize the movie itself was a remake of an original television
series. With all the hype surrounding ``The Fugitive,'' it may be
the action/drama of the season.
</P>
<P>
   JACKASS (MTV) _ Skateboarding Oompa Loompas? Self-mutilation
with red pepper spray and a stun gun? Stupid human tricks with
public toilets? Not standard fare for cable television (unless it's
public access). Following the success of his ``Praise You'' video,
public prankster Spike Jonze brings his 21st-century ``Candid
Camera'' to MTV. Taped with a hidden camera, innocent bystanders
fall into traps of public humiliation. Destined to be a hit with
the Tom Green set, it will undoubtedly cause many a parent to yearn
for shows like ``Father Knows Best.''
</P>
<P>
   DARK ANGEL (Fox) _ In this series, a genetically altered young
woman escapes from a lab experiment and joins forces with an
underground cyber-journalist in San Francisco to work against the
evil powers exploiting them. What that entails, we're not exactly
sure, but with James Cameron (``Titanic'') as executive producer
and sexy new star Jessica Alba, its got a leg up. As long as the
show doesnt get too dark, it could be a heaven-sent hit for Fox.

&HT;     ERVIN CARRIES THE WEIGHT OF BEING A SYMBOL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By GWEN KNAPP  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Anthony Ervin represents all the awkward feelings
that Americans have about race, color and ethnicity. Anthony Ervin
also represents simply Anthony Ervin, U.S. Olympian, college
student and clutch competitor.
</P>
<P>
   He is a symbol, and he is a swimmer. He chose swimming. The
symbolism has been thrust on him, by the news media, by the history
of this country and the history of his sport.
</P>
<P>
   Never before has a black made the Olympic swimming team. Ervin
qualified tentatively on Sunday, when he took fifth in the
100-meter freestyle, positioning himself to be named a relay
alternate. On Tuesday, he earned a definitive spot on the team, in
the 50 freestyle, just four-hundredths of a second behind training
partner Gary Hall Jr. Both of them broke the American record held
by Tom Jager since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the 100 on Sunday, the announcer introduced
another finalist, Stanford graduate Sabir Muhammad, by saying that
he was trying to become the first African-American to swim in the
Olympics. No similar comment was made about Ervin, who had swum
faster in the semifinals and had a better chance of going to
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that was because Ervin is light-skinned. A brief mention
in Sports Illustrated had alerted reporters to his ethnic
background, but the audience had no other way of knowing. So after
the race, Ervin had to delineate his lineage. His father, he said,
was three-quarters African-American and one-quarter American
Indian. He described his mom as white.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of my heritage,'' Ervin said. Asked Tuesday
whether he wanted to be a role model for young black swimmers, he
said he wanted to be a role model for all swimmers, regardless of
race.
</P>
<P>
   He is 19 years old, and he had just recorded a 50-meter time of
21.80 seconds, stunningly fast. Yet the salient number for Ervin
was this: 37.5 percent black.
</P>
<P>
   It seems absurd, another indication of our obsession with race,
how it distorts everything. If we're counting fractions, isn't it
possible that there have been other people with African-American
backgrounds on Olympic swim teams? What about his status as an
American Indian? Is that a first, too? Is anybody keeping such
close track on the status of Asian-Americans?
</P>
<P>
   In a country intent on thoroughly categorizing every identity,
isn't it just as important that Ian Crocker won the 100 butterfly
on Tuesday to become the first Olympic swimmer from the frosty
state of Maine?
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect world, none of it would matter. In an imperfect
world, swimming reflects some of the worst blemishes. Historically,
the sport has been a racial dividing line, specifically separating
whites and blacks. During his infamous ``Nightline'' meltdown,
Dodgers executive Al Campanis cited swimming as one of the things
blacks couldn't do, in the same way that they couldn't manage
baseball teams. He said it as if everyone would understand, as if
it were established fact.
</P>
<P>
   Campanis said that blacks lacked buoyancy. Years later, a black
friend of mine started taking basic swimming lessons. He told me he
was struggling in the water, that he couldn't stay afloat and he
wondered, however abashedly, whether there was some truth to the
stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   As a former swimming instructor, I told him that I believed the
reason he couldn't float was his age, not his race. Unskilled
adults have such a well-honed terror of the water that their feet
instinctively reach for the bottom of the pool. Children don't know
enough to be afraid. Adults have learned, and the knowledge makes
them rigid in the water. For my friend, the stereotypes only added
another layer of doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The silly myths don't take into account generations of
segregation at pools and beaches, or the fact that swimming came to
be perceived as a country-club sport. Consider what happened to
Muhammad, one of the best swimmers in the world, when he moved to
Hawaii to train and landed a small part on ``Baywatch.'' He was
cast as a basketball player.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad has stated that he wanted to break down racial barriers
by making the Olympic team. Some people wonder whether he would
swim better if he didn't have to carry the additional weight of
being a pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Davis, another longtime contender who is black, has been
reticent about the attention he gets. In print, he has wondered why
no one had made as much fuss over the ethnicity of Pablo Morales,
the 1992 gold medalist in the 100 butterfly. He would like to be a
swimmer, not a symbol.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Swimming, the sport's governing body, has tried to take on
some of the burden, bringing inner-city swimmers to the national
training center in Colorado. National team director Dennis Pursley
said he had noticed more blacks swimming at regional meets, the
starting point for Olympic dreamers.
</P>
<P>
   But in the summer of Tiger and Venus, swimming seems rather out
of step with the other country-club sports. Even figure skating,
which is judged by people in fur coats, has achieved far more
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Ervin represents a breakthrough only for American
swimming. In 1988, Anthony Nesty, a black man from Suriname, won
the 100-meter butterfly at the Olympics. He could have been a giant
role model, but American TV doesn't pay attention to winners who
don't mouth ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' on the medals stand.
</P>
<P>
   And except for every four years, TV barely pays attention to any
swimmers. Obscurity doesn't help attract newcomers to a sport.
</P>
<P>
   Ervin might help a little. But that's not his job. He has
something special. His coach, Mike Bottom of the University of
California at Berkeley, calls him ``the best racer I've ever
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame we can't ignore other labels.

farewell. Like the flawed hero in his own Hollywood movie,
President Bill Clinton prepared to address the Democratic Party
faithful Monday night on a wave of high emotion and extravagant
praise for the man who would succeed him, Vice President Al Gore.
But the Gore camp has had to worry about being upstaged. Just by
opening his mouth and smiling his infectiously boyish smile,
Clinton risks putting his putative successor into the shade. In the

presidential nomination after two failed attempts, he must now show
that there is genuine substance beneath the exaggerated ardor or

accepts the Democratic nomination for president, will keep him in
the presidential race with a sporting chance of winning. Failure
could spell the beginning of the end of his political career, at

   LONDON _ Just an hour's (slow) drive from San Gimignano are half
a dozen Italian towns that are trying to slow down the pace of
life. They are members of the ``Slow City'' movement, where towns
sign up to a series of measures designed to make life calmer and
hence more enjoyable for citizens and visitors alike. The Slow
Cities project touches a nerve everywhere because one of the
growing divisions in our society is not about money but about time.
For most of us there is a genuine problem of balance: how do we get
our work done, fulfill our social and family obligations, and still
find time for fun? The Slow Cities movement can teach us some

&HT;     CRITIC SAYS U.S. ANTAGONISM SPAWED RUSSIAN SUB EXERCISE

<P>
   The sinking of a Russian nuclear sub and the possible loss of
its 116-member crew could have been avoided if only the United
States hadn't been a menacing power perpetuating the Cold War, a
former Navy official said.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States may not have been responsible for
Saturday's sinking of the submarine Kursk, the Russians might have
been holding the maneuvers in which the boat participated as a
reaction to the threat of superior American power, said retired
Rear Adm. Eugene Carroll, a vocal critic of the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that Russia would be out trying to use 10 ships
to practice fighting World War III if it weren't for indications
that NATO was aggressive and NATO is threatening, and they'd better
have some military capability to deal with it,'' Carroll told the
San Antonio Express-News Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's laughable, it's pitiful that they should think that
NATO's going to attack them and that they have the means to defeat
that attack,'' he added, ``but it's understandable.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll bemoaned America's conduct in the post-Cold War era,
which he argued has put Russia on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to build a national missile defense (system) that
the Russians abhor,'' he explained. ``We expanded NATO, the U.S.
was the driving force in expanding NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the driving force in attacking Serbia. We are going
out of our way to show the ex-Soviet Union, Russia, we are the boss
and in the driver's seat and they'd better mind their manners.
That's nothing but saying we won the Cold War and we're rubbing
your nose in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Declaring the chances of a successful rescue as ``pretty
dismal,'' Carroll said the incident might further prod the Russians
to improve their conventional forces, which have been on the
decline since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Naval officials declined to comment on the statements made by
Carroll, a frequent critic of the service and an ardent foe of
expanding the U.S. submarine fleet. The sub force has 56 fast
attack boats today and the Navy has called for expanding to 67 or
even as many as 76 in 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   A one-time aviator and Pentagon war planner, Carroll made his
comments as Russian rescue teams made desperate attempts to save
the Kursk's crew, who have been trapped 354 feet below the surface
of the icy Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   The 500-foot-long boat, part of what one observer called the
biggest Russian naval exercise in years, sank after a torpedo room
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Its air, water and power supplies have been running on batteries
since the Kursk's nuclear reactors were shut down. The Russians
repeatedly tried to lower a rescue capsule to the submarine, but a
number of American observers said the situation was grim for Kursk,
which has taken on large amounts of water.
</P>
<P>
   Naval analyst Norman Polmar and other observers said the crew
might have as little as one week left to live, depending on how
much oxygen and compressed air was in the sub at the time of the
accident as well as the state of the Kursk's battery and the
buildup of carbon dioxide, which is fatal at high levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say keep hope alive but I think the longer it goes on
the worse off they are,'' said Ivan Eland, director of defense
policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fourth and long,'' said Sherry Sontag, co-author of
``Blind Man's Bluff,'' a best-selling book on the role of U.S.
submarines in undersea espionage during the Cold War. ``It's a very
precarious situation.''

   PAYETTE NATIONAL FOREST, Idaho _ As a flame-spewing monster
roars through the canyons here, sweaty, soot-covered soldiers from
Fort Hood, Texas, realize they are fighting a battle they can't
win.
</P>
<P>
   They wear banana-yellow flame-resistant shirts instead of
camouflage, carry shovels instead of M-16s, and fear hot coals and
falling trees instead of snipers or land mines.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a real-life scenario, if something threatened my life, I
would kill it, take it down,'' infantryman Specialist Mitch Court
said during a grueling march up a mountain where towering fir and
pine trees had been burned into eerie charred skeletons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, it is different _ dig a little bit, dig a little more,''
said Court, who has twice been to troubled Bosnia and once to
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   About 18 new large fires were reported Tuesday, bringing to 85
the number of fires burning almost 4.9 million acres in 11 Western
states, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the fires are believed to have been touched off by
lightning and spread by high winds blowing through dangerously dry
and rugged terrain.
</P>
<P>
   While Army crews from the 4th Infantry Division help battle the
fires, officials concede that in many instances the best that can
be done is corralling the fires into remote areas and waiting for
winter storms to snuff them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fought the good fight and that is good enough,'' said Col.
Darryl Williams, the Task Force Thunder commander. ``We are not
trying to put this fire out, the fire will be put out by winter
storms.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 560 Fort Hood-based soldiers are halfway through their
mission to support veteran civilian firefighters here. Another 500
are training for positions in neighboring Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers are dropped by helicopter, then take Humvees into
remote places where they walk for hours searching for burning coals
and hot spots.
</P>
<P>
   The 2.3 million-acre Payette National Forest is usually home to
breathtaking views and world-class kayaking. But as a Black Hawk
helicopter hovered near the Salmon River on Tuesday afternoon, a
huge inferno spewing orange and gray clouds raged in a remote
canyon, as smaller fires rose from other canyons south of the
river.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the ground, a distance from the inferno, Court made his
way along a dirt trail cut to stop the blaze from spreading. Court
carries a 24-pound chainsaw to devour logs.
</P>
<P>
   A tank of gasoline is strapped to his buddy's rucksack, but the
soldier says he's not nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Other soldiers with shovels and picks dig up and smother
smoldering coals from portions of the fire already battled by
veteran civilian firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   The marches can be difficult, with as many as 30 percent of the
soldiers in some units suffering blisters or knee and ankle
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to marching in brand new lumberjack boots instead of
their combat boots, the soldiers have had a tough time breathing in
the thin air at 7,000-plus feet of altitude.
</P>
<P>
   They wear fire-retardant pants and shirts and leather gloves, as
well as the heavy lumberjack boots with a special bottom that
allows them to walk on hot coals.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers carry fire protection blankets on their belts for quick
deployment, and haul tools such as pick, shovels and hoses. Some
have the added weight of carrying bags of water on their backs.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, soldiers were forced to walk on their hands and
knees for hundreds of yards as they scaled a near-vertical
mountainside
</P>
<P>
   ``For these guys, it is not God and country, it is get through
the next 15 minutes,'' said Lt. Steven Miller, leader of a team of
19 men.
</P>
<P>
   Still, not all were feeling beat down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this stuff -- the outdoors,'' said Specialist
Christopher Vann, 21, a soldier from San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, soldiers rarely have worked side-by-side with elite
civilian firefighters. They had been carrying out ``mop-up duties''
to ensure already burned areas don't re-ignite and that undamaged
areas aren't set ablaze by coals drifting in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't have enough people. There are too many fires,''
said Paul Head, a U.S. Forest Service liaison with the military,
who said the soldiers have dramatically multiplied his manpower.
</P>
<P>
   What soldiers lack in firefighting experience, they make up for
with discipline, fitness and the ability to function as a unit, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Soaking and filthy, fire-seeking soldiers hike through canyons
in temperatures often as much as 50 degrees hotter than at the camp
sight. Only to return to their remote camp where they sleep on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Clete Edmunson, a history teacher in Idaho who grew up in a
nearby logging community and has helped fight fires, said he is
thankful for the military's help, but that there is no way to
extinguish the blaze here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are kind of at the mercy of Mother Nature,'' he said.

you can pretty much rest assured the folks on Wall Street have long
since moved on to the next issue. Since early July, at least, a
consensus has been building that the Fed would leave interest rates
unchanged at its Aug. 22 meeting. And a growing number of market
players are seriously considering when the Fed will ease next.

DEAR AL: JUST GIVE UP AND CAMPAIGN WITH HIM
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BILL THOMPSON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hasn't anybody told Bill Clinton that he's not allowed to run
for a third term?
</P>
<P>
   The president's speech at Monday's opening session of the
Democratic National Convention was billed as a farewell address,
but it sounded a lot more like a plea for four more years than a
valedictory. Clinton spoke for 40-plus minutes and seemed
constantly on the verge of blurting, ``I accept your nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt about it: If the 22nd Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution limiting presidents to two terms hadn't been ratified
way back in 1951, Clinton would be asking the electorate for a
contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   And you know what's scary? He'd probably get it.
</P>
<P>
   Even as repercussions of the great White House sex scandal
linger on _ even as the tally of Clinton apologies for that
``terrible mistake'' climbs toward double digits _ the president's
job approval ratings remain sky-high. Even among those who believe
that Clinton is a devious cad, there is apparently no shortage of
Americans who like the job he's done as president.
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't like it any better than he likes it, of course.
The Great Prevaricator nearly broke his arm patting himself on the
back during that speech, which was supposed to be a rhetorical
passing of the torch to his vice president and would-be successor,
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore got a mention here or there, but Clinton obviously was on a
mission to give himself a leg up on history, not to give his
ex-running mate a boost in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Which should have surprised exactly nobody _ especially Gore,
who surely knows this self-serving president as well as anyone
does, if not better. Gore has labored alongside Clinton for nearly
eight years, acting as apologist in chief for the most
self-absorbed commander in chief since Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky for the country that the U.S. Senate didn't vote to
convict Clinton in that impeachment trial awhile back. We can only
imagine what might have happened once Clinton got the order to
vacate the White House. He could still be holed up in the Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the next president might need an eviction notice from
the Supreme Court and a contingent of federal marshals to drive
Clinton off the premises.
</P>
<P>
   Put down the phone, people. It was just a joke.
</P>
<P>
   All kidding aside, there is little doubt that Clinton would stay
if he could. We're talking about a man whose sole ambition in life
was to be president of the United States. It's understandable that
he would be reluctant to surrender the only job he ever wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has vowed _ threatened? _ to hang onto the reins until
the last minute of the last hour of the last day of his presidency.
Unlike most Clinton promises, this is one he clearly intends to
keep.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Clinton refused to yield the spotlight Monday night, he
will be unable to resist the urge to upstage Gore in the weeks and
months ahead. Clinton will seize every possible opportunity to
remind America and the world that he is still president of the
United States; that he is still calling the shots; that he, Bill
Clinton, is the man who gave the greatest nation on earth eight
years of prosperity, peace and progress.
</P>
<P>
   And that's a problem for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it?
</P>
<P>
   David Gergen, a Republican who worked in Clinton's White House,
said on television the other night that Gore ought to stop trying
to distance himself from Clinton _ that the vice president ought to
grab hold of the president's coattails and try to ride those
Clinton job approval ratings right into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   He might have a point. Clinton has no intention of getting out
of Gore's way, and Gore's opponents have no intention of letting
him wash his hands of Clinton's less admirable adventures.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe Gore should take Gergen's advice. Maybe Gore should
invite Clinton onto the bus for one of those cross-country tours
that so captivated the electorate back in the good old days.
</P>
<P>
   Gore might as well run with Clinton. He's getting nowhere
running away from him.

   EDITORS: The New York Times is planning several pages of
Democratic convention-related stories for Thursday, Aug. 17. The
New York Times News Service will file the following stories, photos
and graphics today in the ``p'' news file. This budget will be
updated by 6 p.m. ET with additional stories and details. For
repeats or information, call 888-346-9867 or 212-556-1927.

<P>
   DEM-RDP-NYT (Los Angeles) _ A roundup: Vice President Al Gore is
nominated; Joseph Lieberman speaks to the convention.
</P>
<P>
   (EDS: An early version of the roundup by Christopher S. Wren
will move by 3 p.m. ET and will be updated after 9 p.m. ET with a
final version written by Richard L. Berke, with quotes from late
speeches.)

York Times on the Web: www.nytimes.com

<P>
   DEM-ASSESS-NYT (Los Angeles) _ A political analysis of the
convention. By R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   DEM-GORE-BIO-TRANSFORM-NYT (Undated) _ After Al Gore ran for
president in 1988 and lost, just as he turned 40, he organized a
series of dinners where he went around the room and asked each
person to tell him where he had gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   It was excruciating, his friends said, but he insisted on
hearing the bad news _ in detail _ about a campaign that had
started out as an environmental crusade and ended as a New York
food fight. He heard that he had no economic vision and that he had
talked about technology and the environment in ways people couldn't
understand. Oh, and his speaking style needed a ton of work.
</P>
<P>
   Gore responded, as he always has, by going back to school. He
put together a graduate seminar for one, complete with a syllabus
and a heavy-duty reading list, and applied himself to the serious
study of tax policy and business history. He brought in a
mathematician to explain chaos theory. And he hired a speech
consultant and a dance coach _ ``a ballet type,'' he told one
friend _ to help him move more fluidly.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians often learn from and are even transformed by a good
drubbing at the polls, but few have pursued their lessons as
aggressively as Gore. And no one can say that the man who will
accept the Democratic Party's nomination for the presidency
Thursday night has not diligently prepared for this moment. By
Melinda Henneberger and Katharine Q. Seelye.
</P>

   DEM-GORE-ARRIVAL-NYT (Los Angeles) _ Al Gore arrives in Los
Angeles, attends a rally with Lieberman and meets with the
Connecticut and Tennessee delegates. By Katharine Q. Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   DEM-NETWORK-STRATEGY-NYT (Los Angeles) _ Of the many contrasts
that persist between the Democratic convention and the GOP
gathering, the party's network strategy is one of the biggest. As
far as the DNC is concerned, there really are only two important
moments here: Clinton's speech and Al Gore's. Everything else is
superfluous. By Peter Marks.

profile of the most prolific fund-raiser in the party. By Alex
Kuczynski.
</P>
<P>
   DEM-INTERNET-NYT (Undated) _ If any group was hoping for a
convention ``bounce'' _ the much-vaunted spike in popularity that
supposedly comes from a political convention _ it was the scores of
political Web sites that made their online debut in Los Angeles and
in Philadelphia with lots of gizmos and hype.
</P>
<P>
   But the what the conventions are showing is that the bounce for
these Internet sites is more of, well, a fizzle. While the coming
of the Internet to the conventions was initially heralded as being
as groundbreaking as the advent of convention television 52 years
ago, the reality has been somewhat less impressive _ for the
moment. By Leslie Wayne.

Laurie Goodstein.
</P>
<P>
   DEM-CORZINE-NYT (Los Angeles) _ Now that the national ticket is
established as determinedly centrist, where does the liberal Jon
Corzine fit in? The New Jersey candidate for the Senate is at the
convention having a good time, heading the caucus in the morning,
going to Hollywood events, raising money for other candidates. And
he's purchased 250 tickets to the Barbra Streisand-Enrique
Iglesias-Boyz II Men-Whoopi Goldberg concert on Thursday night: He
has a small speaking role, not prime-time on Wednesday. By David M.
Halbfinger.
</P>
<P>
   DEM-MENENDEZ-NYT (Los Angeles) _ Robert Menendez, the
Cuban-American politician from Hudson County, gets five minutes in
prime time, just before Lieberman speaks at 10 pm. The first
Hispanic in Congressional leadership, who says he is concerned that
Democrats are taking Latino vote for granted, speaks in Spanish a
bit and praises Lieberman for representing all minorities on the
ticket. (Byline to come.)

BRITAIN OFFICIALLY RULES CONCORDE UNFIT TO FLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British aviation authorities on Wednesday formally
ruled the Concorde supersonic airliner unfit to fly unless its
manufacturers took steps to prevent the problems that led to last
month's fatal Air France Concorde crash near Paris. The French said
on Wednesday that they were contemplating a similar step.
</P>
<P>
   The British authorities said the accident's ``primary cause''
was a tire that burst and expelled debris that ruptured a fuel
tank. The withdrawal of the Concorde's airworthiness certificate by
Britain's Civil Aviation Authority was the first such action
against a commercial airliner in more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Air France grounded its five remaining Concordes immediately
after the July 25 crash of Concorde Flight AF 4590, which plunged
to the ground about 90 seconds after take-off, killing 113 people
in the first fatal accident involving the supersonic airplane.
British Airways, the only other Concorde operator, grounded its
entire fleet of seven Concordes on Tuesday after learning that the
airworthiness certificate would be revoked Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Without an airworthiness certificate, aircraft are not permitted
to fly. British Airways said Wednesday that it had suspended
Concorde flights through September, but gave no clear indication
whether it believed the aircraft _ which crosses the Atlantic in
about three and one-half hours at up to twice the speed of sound _
would ever return to commercial service.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde has been plying scheduled trans-Atlantic and
charter routes for almost 25 years and had come to be seen as an
icon of prestigious travel for executives and celebrities ready to
pay up to $10,000 for a round-trip ticket.
</P>
<P>
   After the July 25 crash, French investigators said they believed
that a metal strip on the runway at Charles de Gaulle airport
outside Paris had caused a tire to burst. The blow-out caused
chunks of rubber to rupture fuel tanks located in the wings close
to Concorde's four jet engines. Concorde's spindly, stork-like
landing gear is positioned directly below the wings and engines.
</P>
<P>
   But, while Air France suspended its Concorde flights immediately
after the July 25 crash, British Airways ordered only a one-day
suspension before putting its own Concordes back into service.
British aviation experts said the British Concordes had been
modified to protect the wings from tire blow-outs in the mid-1990s,
while Air France Concordes had not been modified.
</P>
<P>
   However, Malcolm Field, the chairman of the Civil Aviation
Authority, an official regulatory body, said, ``It is clear to all
of us on the CAA that a tire burst alone should never cause the
loss of a public transport aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the authority had asked Concorde's manufacturers, BAe
Systems, Airbus UK and Aerospatiale of France, to devise a plan to
insure that accidents could not be caused by a tire blow-out. Under
aviation regulations, airplanes whose fuel tanks are vulnerable to
catastrophic damage from burst-tire debris may not be certified as
airworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Field rejected the idea that the demand for modifications
effectively meant the Concorde would never fly again. ``We would
wish Concorde to fly again,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jean-Claude Gayssot, the French transport minister, also said
the measures did not necessarily imply the end of supersonic
travel. ``Anyone who says it's the end for supersonic flights has
got it wrong,'' he told the French newspaper Liberation.
``Traveling fast is going to be increasingly in demand.''
</P>
<P>
   A British investigator, Ken Smart, of Britain's Air Accident
Investigation Branch, said the precise links between the sequence
of events that doomed Flight AF 4590 last month had not yet been
established in detail.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the burst tire sent debris flying to puncture one
or more fuel tanks, allowing fuel to spill out and catch fire
within seconds. The airplane, thundering down the runway at around
195 mph for take-off, lost thrust in one engine, then in two. ``The
crew had no means to make them aware of the nature of the fire nor
to take action against it,'' he said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   He said the safety issues relating to the tires would take
``some time to resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   Burst tires have been a worry for Concorde pilots since the
plane entered service, according to British aviation experts. Since
then, there have been seven known blow-outs in which debris struck
fuel tanks without rupturing them, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Modifications to the British Airways Concordes in 1993 involved
changes to a water deflector on the undercarriage to ``reduce the
energy'' from a tire-burst, according to Derek Blackhall, the head
of the certification section of Britain's Civil Aviation Authority.

&HT;     PAT BUCHANAN'S PITIFUL CRUSADE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Aug. 20)   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For all their overblown rhetoric and inflated
promises, Al Gore and George W. Bush each hopes to lead the United
States into a future of continued prosperity and enlightened
policies.
</P>
<P>
   The bombastic Pat Buchanan, who was nominated for president last
week by one wing of the warring Reform Party, may have the same
hope. But the policies he espouses are not those of the future. If
put into practice, they would not perpetuate prosperity or
illuminate the way ahead. They would have exactly the opposite
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan advocates the failed policies of yesteryear _ the
protectionist and isolationist policies that exacerbated the Great
Depression in the 1930s and, in the same era, led vicious dictators
to understand that they could subvert one country after another
with their military might, without fear of retribution.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's policies are bigoted and myopic. He worships at the
shrine of Ronald Reagan, his one-time White House boss, and claims
to be the inheritor of the Gipper's conservatism. But Reagan was
neither a protectionist nor an isolationist.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan understood quite clearly that the Earth is round and that
there must be a strong relationship between nations. It was Reagan,
working with the Soviet Union's Mikhail Gorbachev, who finally
ended the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Were Reagan well and able to communicate, he could explain to
the men and women of labor that the more American products
foreigners buy from us the more we can sell to them. And if we sell
to them, our own businesses and industries will flourish _
benefiting working men and women.
</P>
<P>
   It would be idiocy to claim that in the short run some jobs
which traditionally were performed by Americans will not be
performed by foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   All we need do is wander through stores that sell television
sets, radios, computers and clothing to see that our shops are
filled with products made in China, Korea, Taiwan and many other
nations.
</P>
<P>
   But to reduce American purchase of items from those countries
would hinder their ability to ascend the economic ladder _ and thus
reduce their ability to buy our goods.
</P>
<P>
   Globalism is a term that frightens and angers Americans who
believe we can prosper by closing our borders and going it alone.
But ours is _ and will continue to be _ a global economy; American
business and enterprise can be found everywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Reforms can and should be implemented, but we cannot,
Buchanan-style, turn our backs on our future destiny.
</P>
<P>
   We stand at the pinnacle of world power because we have worked,
sometimes very successfully, sometimes less so, to ensure
cooperation among nations large and small.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan exudes hate for the United Nations and America's
alliances with other countries. Buchanan told his faction of the
Reform Party that if he were president, he would order the United
Nations out of the United States and dispatch American Marines to
New York to help pack the bags of U.N. representatives.
</P>
<P>
   To cheers and applause of his supporters, Buchanan lambasted the
``commissars of the U.S. Supreme Court,'' the ``Visigoths and
vandals of multiculturalism'' and the ``gods of the global
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan wants to withdraw American peacekeeping forces from
places like South Korea and Kosovo and reassign them along the
U.S.-Mexican border to halt illegal immigration. He also has
suggested constructing a wall or fence the length of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Illegal immigration from Mexico is a troublesome matter,
especially in border states such as California, Arizona, New Mexico
and Texas. Every recent administration in Washington has taken
steps to halt or curtail it. Yet, night after night, would-be
migrants are caught and returned to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's proposed solution would be outrageously expensive and
insulting to our good neighbor to the south. Mexico's
president-elect, Vicente Fox, has urged a new U.S., Canadian and
Mexican partnership that would view Mexican workers and resources
as ``an opportunity, not a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Washington Post, Fox said ``we must be
better friends, we must be better neighbors, we must be better
partners.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not Buchanan's way. His way is to fence the United
States in and Mexico out, to end free trade that has proved so
beneficial to Americans, and to abandon scores of international
agreements and alliances that have helped spread democracy and
economic growth around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the American way in the 21st century.

 &HT;    Roberts plays a rebel with a cause
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Julia Roberts lets it all hang out _ thanks to some
cleavage-pinching support bras and low-neck dresses _ but delivers
a performance so fierce and funny, her breasts don't upstage her.
</P>
<P>
   She plays a smart, sailor-mouthed single mom who wangles her way
into a job at a small law firm (run by the estimable Albert
Finney). Following a hunch, she starts investigating health
problems in a small town and in the process launches what winds up
as a $33 million judgment against Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric Co. for
basically poisoning the local population.
</P>
<P>
   The movie goes for the obvious a few times, as it shows
Brockovich alienating her family as she becomes obsessed with the
case. But Roberts is terrific, and it helps that she's directed by
Steven Soderbergh, one of the best (and least heralded) directors
working in Hollywood. Priced to buy: $22.98 VHS, $26.98 DVD.

less-engaging half, Larch's protege, parentless Homer Wells (Tobey

   The political conventions have assailed us, whether we like it
or not. (If you'rBush likes ``Field of Dreams'' and ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' while Al Gore prefers ``Local Hero'' and ``King of
Hearts.'') Here are some films that remind us that show biz and
politics have always made not-so-strange bedfellows.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Young Mr. Lincoln''didate for president than Henry Fonda.
True, John Ford's classic is less about Lincoln on the stump than
it is about a murder case the young lawyer takes early in his
career. But Milburn Stone is very much in evidence as Stephen
Douglas, Lincoln's political opponent. In fact, Stone insisted on
researching his characterank, an internal improvement system and a
high protective tariff. Those are my sentiments and political
principles. If elected, I shall be thankful. If not, it'll be all
the same.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Best Man'' (1964): Fonda again, only 25 years later. He
plays a thoughtful liberal seeking his party's presidential
nomination against Cliff Robertson, an oily opportunist. Gore

 &HT;    CHIAPAS ELECTION THAT COULD FORCE NEW CHAPTER IN ZAPATISTA
CONFLICT

 &HT;    EDs: For purposes of a locator map, Yajalon is located about 90
miles north of San Cristobal de las Casas, in Chiapas state.
 &HT;    For Use Sun. Aug. 20 And Thereafter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   YAJALON, MEXICO _ Pigs snorted in mud and a chilly rain soaked
the mountains outside as Nicolas Lopez described how armed men
staged a terrifying raid on his hamlet earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Firing weapons into the air, the invaders claimed rights to the
villagers' land, setting fire to five huts, chasing about 30
families into hiding, and looting what little corn and clothes the
peasants had, Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as he shivered at the memory, Lopez managed a smile. On
Sunday(8/20) the Mayan Indian will vote in a historic election for
the new governor of Chiapas, one of Mexico's most impoverished and
volatile states. And if pre-election opinion polls are accurate,
Mexico's 71-year-old ruling party is headed for another defeat
after being trounced in July 2's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are waiting for a solution to our problems,'' said Lopez,
who will vote for Pablo Salazar, candidate of an opposition
alliance that could unseat Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary
Party, the PRI, from a state considered a barometer of social
justice in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Chiapas is home to the Zapatista Indian rebels, who launched an
insurrection against the Mexican government here in January 1994
that still hasn't been resolved. Since that time, armed
paramilitary groups loyal to the ruling party have also evolved,
periodically attacking Zapatista sympathizers like Lopez's hamlet.
</P>
<P>
   ``All government ties to these paramilitary groups will end (if
the PRI loses). One way to dismantle these groups is to simply not
guarantee them impunity any longer,'' said a sweat-soaked Salazar,
pausing for an interview and quick lunch during one of his final
grueling all-day campaign swings along Chiapas' sweltering tropical
coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are fed up and want change. And change is contagious,''
he said, waving at a marimba band in a restaurant that played a
song as a tribute to the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But Chiapas is considered a bulwark state for the PRI, and its
candidate, Sami David, has counted on a sympathetic state media
establishment that, as usual, offered slavishly favorable coverage
to him. A cordial man who is warm one-on-one, David also touched a
traditionally conservative nerve here with a campaign warning that
a Salazar victory could provoke even more instability.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Chiapas, an era of stability is at stake,'' David told a
recent gathering of PRI youth in the capital city of Tuxtla
Gutierrez.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the northern part of Chiapas is a checkerboard of Mayan
Indian villages divided between Zapatistas and PRI loyalists who
sporadically clash over land rights and political differences. The
collection of huts where Lopez lived _ nestled in rugged hills
above the city of Yajalon (pronounced, ``ya-ha-LONE'') _ was
eventually occupied by Mexican Army troops. But since the villagers
also fear the army, they refused to return.
</P>
<P>
   The election of Mexican President-elect Vicente Fox has sparked
hope for a peaceful resolution to the cycle of violence. Fox
ousted, for the first time in seven decades, the PRI, which the
Zapatistas blame for the squalid conditions the southern state's
Indians live in.
</P>
<P>
   Before the July 2 election, Subcommander Marcos, the primary
Zapatista spokesman, issued a statement reiterating the rebels'
position that they would negotiate again if a peace accord signed
in 1996 is implemented and federal troops are withdrawn from Indian
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is a promoter of free-market economic policies, which the
Zapatistas oppose, but he has pledged to revive negotiations with
the rebels and send Mexico's Congress the stalled 1996 accord that
grants sweeping Indian rights. If elected, Salazar could also set
an example that change can be forced at the ballot box rather than
at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one, not even the most radical person in the country can
dispute the legitimacy of a Fox government,'' Salazar said,
predicting that the Zapatistas can't dismiss electoral change.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent campaign stop in the gritty border town of Hidalgo
on the Guatemala border, supporters were enraptured with Salazar's
pledge to address the demands of the poor _ including the
Zapatistas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Zapatistas said our fight is against being forgotten. They
said there is a worse death than dying from diarrhea or from
curable diseases,'' the candidate shouted from the stage to wild
cheers. ``There is a worse death, say our Indian brothers, and that
is the death that comes from being forgotten. Well, you people are
about to do something about that painful reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Salazar is a federal senator and former member of the PRI, which
he says used to be the only option available to someone who wanted
to get into political office. But he left the party in May 1999
after a long string of disputes over the government's handling of
the Chiapas conflict.
</P>
<P>
   He is unaffiliated now, but is representing a four-party
alliance that includes Fox's conservative National Action Party, or
PAN, and the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, the PRD. The two
parties clash ideologically, but for the purpose of defeating the
PRI in Chiapas they pooled their funds and worked hand-in-hand for
Salazar.
</P>
<P>
   An exhausted-looking David said he isn't giving up, and he
dismisses polls like one conducted by Reforma newspapers, which
gave Salazar a 9-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Chiapas, the conditions to avoid confrontations or even
social collapse are being constructed with great difficulty,'' he
said an interview with Cox Newspapers. He had a badly bruised and
swollen ear, the result of an injury when someone threw a metal
weight at him in Salazar's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a platform for electoral reform,'' he insisted. ``The
offers for change have to be based on clarity and not on
deception.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI's presidential candidate, Francisco Labastida, won in
Chiapas last month. But Salazar is counting on the combined votes
of the PAN and the PRD to carry him to victory. His campaign
posters say, ``the PRI has already lost in Chiapas, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's victory could also inspire PRI desertion.
</P>
<P>
   Among some of Chiapas' poor peasant farmers, Fox is now seen as
Mexico's new ``tlatoani,'' the Aztec word for ``maximum leader,''
Salazar campaign aide Mauricio Gandara said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know that the 'Papa PRI' has died now. So they are
wondering who will be managing the money and resources. They are
thinking that now there is a 'Papa Fox,''' Gandara said. ``This is
the product of 71 years of domination by one party.''
</P>
<P>
   Araceli Burguete, a Chiapas sociologist, said the PRI still
controls many Indians in the state. It will probably be business as
usual in Indian towns where the local PRI leader habitually orders
residents how to vote, she said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But even in PRI strongholds, some residents appeared to be
bracing for change.
</P>
<P>
   Chenalho is an Indian town that produced at least one of the
convicted killers implicated in the infamous December 1997 massacre
of 45 people in the pro-Zapatista village of Acteal, just minutes
away.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Jimenez, 82, said he would listen to the advice of
village leaders, but wasn't sure who he'd vote for. He pulled
dismissively at a PRI T-shirt he was wearing and said almost
apologetically, ``This is five years old now.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Luis Ortiz, a resident who has joined the movement to
deploy thousands of election observers here, complained that the
PRI had donated a Ford truck to the town ``in exchange for votes.''
</P>
<P>
   In Acteal, the site of the massacre, affiliates of the Zapatista
Army said they didn't plan to vote and declined to speak further.
Rebel leaders have been silent, other than to say they won't call
for a general boycott of the election.
</P>
<P>
   Those in Acteal who sympathize with the rebels but don't belong
to the army will cast ballots for Salazar.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Salazar doesn't win, we will think there has been fraud,''
said Spanish-speaking spokesman Agustin Vasquez. ``Acteal is
willing to vote for Salazar. The victims of the massacre are
waiting for justice and for change.''

 VETERANS ANSWER FAN MAIL FOR CLINTON PETS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER WALSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dozens of retired veterans are serving their
country again _ this time armed with black pens and envelopes to
take on the thousands of letters sent to the White House each day.
</P>
<P>
   The mailroom duties for residents of the Soldiers' and Airmen's
Home include meeting requests for birthday greetings and get-well
cards. But one job is theirs alone: answering letters sent to
President Clinton's cat, Socks, and dog, Buddy.
</P>
<P>
   In the past seven years, the stark basement of the veteran's
home in Northwest Washington has been transformed into a decorative
tribute to the first feline and canine. The makeshift wallpaper
consists of items sent by letter writers, such as photographs of
look-a-like cats and dogs, oversized letters from kindergarten
classes, and children's drawings. The desks are adorned with Socks
and Buddy paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   It all began when the White House put out a call in March 1993
for volunteers to help handle the 35,000 letters to the Clintons
that arrive daily. The nation's oldest veterans retirement home
responded with 38 volunteers, but after a few months, the 3-mile
trip downtown and the formalities of the White House became
tiresome for the senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to wear a coat and tie all the time,'' said Bill D.
Woods, a retired Korean and Vietnam War veteran. ``So we said, `Why
can't we open an annex at the Soldiers' Home?' For the first time
in history, the president let his mail leave the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the veterans have answered about 1.9 million
letters, 320,000 of them for the president's pets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are from children, and some are from adults pretending to
be cats,'' said veteran Allan H. Gordon, who acts as Socks's
unofficial secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who coordinates the mailroom annex, explained: ``They
don't want to write the president, but they want to write the cat
because they think they can get the message through to the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie, a youngster from Lonedell, Mont., wrote to Buddy on
light-blue stationery with puffy white clouds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gee, I wish I was the president's dog. It must feel really
neat. I mean being petted by famous people, riding in fancy cars,
or just living in the White House,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buddy'' responded on his standard portrait postcard with his
pawprint at the bottom and the message: ``Thank you for writing me.
Living at the White House is exciting, and I am enjoying my new
family.''
</P>
<P>
   A kindergarten class from Norcross, Ga., wrote a letter to Socks
on poster-sized ruled paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Socks, What do you look like? Do you wear socks? What
color are you? Do you like kids? Do you like to live at the White
House? We have 20 children in our class. Our teacher has a cat
named `Tinkerbell.' She is grey and white. We're glad the president
has a cat for a pet.''
</P>
<P>
   The children were sent a postcard with Socks's picture and
pawprint saying: ``Thank you for writing to me. I am honored to be
your `First Cat.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton thanked the volunteers about a month ago when he visited
the veterans' home to dedicate Anderson Cottage, President
Lincoln's summer retreat, as a national monument.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who live in this home open amazing volumes of mail
. . . A lot of that mail is the mail that very young children send
to Socks and to Buddy,'' Clinton said. ``It would be impossible to
respond to those children with the staff we have at the White House
if it weren't for the veteran volunteers here who do this and so
many other things to help the White House work.''
</P>
<P>
   About eight volunteers are in the office at any one time. For
many of these veterans, whose average age is 76, working every
morning for about four hours provides a welcome change from the
routine around the retirement home.
</P>
<P>
   Jewel Miggins, 76, started volunteering with her husband, James
Joseph Miggins. He stuffed envelopes and she addressed them. He
died in 1996, shortly after their 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   The memories linger as she opens mail without him, but the job
still invigorates her.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have something to do, it gives you a lift, it gives you a
nice feeling that you're doing something,'' Miggins said. ``To be
able to be kept busy, it's doing something worthwhile and it's
appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the end of Clinton's presidency looms, some veterans
worry that this White House annex could soon close. While it's
unknown whether the next administration would keep the volunteers
who answer the president's mail, there will probably be first pets
in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Governor George W. Bush of Texas has a English springer spaniel
named Spot Fletcher Bush, an offspring of his parents' famous dog
Millie, and two cats named Ernie and India. Vice President Al Gore
has two dogs, a mixed breed named Daisy and a black Labrador
retriever called Shiloh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll vote for anyone who has a pooch,'' Miggins said.

 HE'S ROWING TO EXTREMES  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARNOLD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ESSEX, Mass. _ Tom Mailhot, who plans to race across the
Atlantic Ocean in a rowboat roughly the length of a large canoe,
was sanding the unfinished hull of his plywood craft the other
night when a moment of introspection stopped him.
</P>
<P>
   It should be pointed out that Mailhot, 40, does not stop easily.
</P>
<P>
   He has paddled kayaks through gales off Cape Horn, giant
whirlpools in the Bay of Funday, 30-foot curling seas in the
Bearing Straight. Mailhot expects next year's transatlantic race to
be so rough that he and his rowing partner, John Zeigler, 50, are
padding the boat's watertight sleeping cubby with foam to minimize
injury when waves spin them like a rinse cycle. They may also
install seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   But at this moment, Mailhot had been stilled by a one-word
question: Why?
</P>
<P>
   After a long pause, he answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do it because I'm a survivor. And when you're a survivor,
you keep the challenges coming.''
</P>
<P>
   No question about it _ this time, Mailot's got himself a
whopper.
</P>
<P>
   Mailhot, of Ipswich, and Zeigler from River Edge, N.J., are the
only Americans entered in a race that on Oct. 7, 2001, will launch
49 pairs of rowers 3,000 miles from Tenerife in the Canary Islands
off Africa's coast to Barbados in the Caribbean. They will race
identical rowboats constructed from kits the racers purchased from
the British race organizer.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Chay Blyth has struck again.
</P>
<P>
   Blyth is the former British Army sergeant who has made a
business of extreme adventure contests. He has sent fleets of
identical sailboats hurtling around the world ``the wrong way'' _
against the prevailing winds _ with crews that pay tens of
thousands of dollars to compete and get beaten up by Mother Nature.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Blyth, who 11 years earlier had rowed across the
Atlantic with a partner himself, sponsored the first transatlantic
rowing race. Thirty crews _ none from the United States _ started;
24 crews finished, their times at sea ranging from 41 to 100 days.
Although the first tropical storm hit the man-powered fleet several
days out of Tenerife, there were no serious injuries reported.
</P>
<P>
   The 2001 Ward Evans Atlantic Rowing Challenge (the British
sponsor, perhaps appropriately, sells insurance) will begin with 50
boats. Each one started as 200 laser-cut pieces of marine plywood
that competitors bought for $3,800 _ after they ponied up the
$19,000 entry fee. Glued together, the pieces resemble a
1,650-pound hot dog some 23 feet long and 6 feet wide.
</P>
<P>
   But the kits don't include required extras: two rowing stations,
each with seats on slides; a solar-powered desalinator to make sea
water drinkable; a host of emergency gear including beacons,
flares, life rafts, and radios; and enough food for each rower to
burn an estimated 8,000 calories _ three to four times the norm _
daily for 100 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figure that by the time we've equipped and shipped our
boat, we'll be about $140,000 into this thing,'' said Mailhot, who
expects to launch the rowboat next month from the Essex
Shipbuilding Museum, which has donated a boat house for the
assembly. The project has been funded with private donations and
T-shirt sales on a Web site (www.usrowboys.com).
</P>
<P>
   Mailhot, who is single, is a designer and project manager for
Treehouse Design, a Rockport architectural firm. Zeigler, the
father of two teenagers, is a food wholesaler who described himself
during a telephone interview as coming off a marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose this race is a kind of mid-life crisis thing,'' said
Zeigler. ``It has adventure, some risk, but after all the time
we've put into the boat (an estimated 300 hours), I'm really
beginning to trust it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mailhot and Zeigler each have won numerous canoe, kayak, and
rowboat races, most recently as the team that swept the pack in the
21-mile Blackburn Challenge that circumnavigates Cape Ann. They
plan to row to Barbados in two-hour shifts, one man rowing, one man
sleeping, 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   After subtracting storage space aboard the yet-unnamed rowboat,
the men will share quarters roughly equivalent to the interior of a
compact car for perhaps two months _ maybe longer.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone have any pet peeves exacerbated by the other?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask me when it's over,'' said Mailhot.

IN COWTOWN, EVEN THE SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA HAS CASUAL DAYS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By WAYNE LEE GAY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ From the offices at Radio Shack's corporate
headquarters to the orchestra pit at Bass Performance Hall, Fort
Worth is dressing down.
</P>
<P>
   It's partly the heat, partly western custom and partly a
national trend _ and not everyone is happy about every day becoming
``Casual Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, you can't tell a banker from a trash collector,''
says Norman Warwar, the perturbed proprietor of Norman Tailors, an
upscale downtown men's clothing store that makes custom-made suits
and shirts. ``You can't tell the boss from the employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Casual Friday was popularized during the 1980s, when employers
designated the last day of the workweek for less formal work
attire. A decade later, some companies were allowing their
employees to abandon traditional business wear for a decidedly less
buttoned-down look every day.
</P>
<P>
   A look around Fort Worth reveals a diversity of dress, ranging
from the attorneys at the courthouse _ always in suit and tie _ to
the executive offices at Radio Shack, where casual rules.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing what is appropriate to wear has become so confusing that
even Fort Worth Mayor Kenneth Barr says he's sometimes perplexed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier this week, I went to a reception in a sports coat and
casual shirt,'' he said. ``There were people there in everything
from casual shirts to pinstriped suits. It almost makes you
uncomfortable. The rules are up in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr made fashion history in July 1998, when he removed his tie
at a City Council meeting and declared that casual business wear
would be appropriate for city offices until Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were well into the summer, and I was just hot,'' the mayor
says.
</P>
<P>
   He did not issue a casual edict last summer, but so many people
have asked him about it that casual wear is in vogue again this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been pleased that people have been smart about what to
wear,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   If the day the mayor removed his tie has become tied to the
beginning of dressing down in Cowtown, the trend gained real
momentum in January 1999, when new Radio Shack CEO Leonard Roberts
announced a year-round, all-week ``business casual'' dress code for
the corporate offices in Fort Worth. He also allowed the company's
retail sales force nationwide to shed their ties.
</P>
<P>
   And, for special occasions _ such as an increase in profits or
sales _ the company goes positively country with bluejeans as the
fashion statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our task force found that the trend in North Texas is for
business casual,'' says Laura Moore, Radio Shack's vice president
for public relations. ``People feel good if you don't have to wear
a tie and jacket if it's 105 degrees outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to abandon tradition entirely, Moore says that corporate
headquarters staff may dress more formally for meetings with
outside vendors, although the vendors are informed about Radio
Shack's business casual dress code.
</P>
<P>
   Dressing to identify with the customer _ within reason _ is a
fairly common principle in the retail world these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're becoming more casual,'' says Zig Kaminski, a sales
consultant at Mid-City Chrysler-Jeep in Arlington, a Fort Worth
suburb. Kaminski has worked in auto sales for 14 years and has seen
standard attire for auto sales personnel shift dramatically. At the
dealership, which is closed Saturdays, salesmen wear a shirt and
tie on weekdays and a golf shirt with a company logo on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to go to buy a car dressed up for church,''
Kaminski says. ``We want to appear professional, but nowadays,
being professional doesn't mean wearing a three-piece suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, traditional business attire hasn't completely disappeared
from Fort Worth and surrounding areas. A stroll around downtown on
a recent 102 degree afternoon demonstrated that even the
combination of heat and casual Friday hasn't completely undermined
the custom of tie and jacket for men or business suit for women,
even if the dressed-for-success types looked a bit hot under the
collar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still fairly dressed up,'' says Barbara Ragland,
district director for U.S. Rep. Kay Granger's Fort Worth office.
Ragland says that some congressional offices require women to wear
dresses or skirts, but that women in Granger's Fort Worth office
can wear slacks as part of a suit.
</P>
<P>
   They may even wear western duds for Stock Show days, but there
are no casual Fridays because Mondays and Fridays are the days on
which Granger is most likely to be in Fort Worth and holding
important meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, Doug Ewert, vice president for merchandising at the
Men's Wear House, a chain that advertises lower prices for suits
than department stores, sees a definite trend toward casual
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're maximizing our sportswear,'' Ewert says. ``Casual office
is on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   But, like the mayor of Fort Worth, the typical customer at the
Men's Wear House is a little uncertain about acceptable business
casual, which is why Ewert's company is advertising the concept of
``casual know-how.'' This educates clientele about the differences
between totally casual and business casual _ the so-called third
wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   For women's wear, however, B.J. Wilson, a professional fashion
consultant and owner of the Dressoir boutique, an upscale women's
clothing store, says the trend may be coming full circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a lot of complaints about business casual,'' she
says. ``I think we're going back to more suits.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson says that it's very important that a woman in an office
with lots of men dress professionally: ``She needs the
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the symphony orchestra, that last bastion of 19th-century
formal attire, is less committed to the traditional white tie and
tails. Although the old look prevails for the Fort Worth Symphony
at evening classical concerts, attire for Sunday afternoon concerts
changed 10 years ago to dark suits and ties for male orchestra
members. For children's concerts, the musicians wear bright colored
T-shirts, with a different color for each section of the orchestra;
for outdoor concerts, the musicians also wear more comfortable
T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the Fort Worth Symphony may have more wardrobe
changes than a Cher concert. Although the orchestra will retain its
traditional theater-pit black-tie and tuxedo look when accompanying
the Fort Worth Dallas Ballet this season, male orchestra members
will be allowed to wear simple black shirts when accompanying the
opera, but not all in the name of comfort.
</P>
<P>
   There's a visual aspect to this dressing down, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sight lines at Bass Hall make the pit very visible,'' says
orchestra general manager John Toohey. ``And the black shirts make
less visual distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   So if you're feeling a little confused about how to dress for
work or play, or something in between, you're not alone. As Barr
says: ``It's not a revolution, it's evolution.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   EPPING, N.H. _ If ever there was a group of artists caught
flat-footed by the arrival of fame, it is the Shaggs, who have
taken to holding their meetings with industry people at the Dunkin'
Donuts off Route 125 in Epping.
</P>
<P>
   They file in from the parking lot locked in discussion of a
broken gas gauge, ordinary small-town moms in shorts and tank tops.
It was here, not so long ago, that they met with an envoy from Tom
Cruise's division of Paramount, and not far from here that they
opted to refuse his pitch in favor of another studio's. The Wiggins
_ once shy, rural girls who played their strange pop music for
derisive locals _ have sold the film rights to their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Dot, Helen, and Betty Wiggin had walked away from the Shaggs
without a backward glance in 1975, when their father and fanatical
promoter, Austin, died. But while they retreated into private
lives, their albums were spreading among underground musicians as a
classic of staggering do-it-yourself discord. Then, last November,
for the first time, their world intersected with their fan base.
Venturing onto a New York stage with their hearts in their throats,
they faced a crowd of hipsters who knew their songs better than
they did. One fan, a man from Los Angeles, had art from their album
cover tattooed on his leg.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the sisters have had the strange experience of
getting to know their own cult following. And they are making a
serious effort to understand the appeal of their music.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the sincere part, and the honest _ at least that's what
they say, the sincere and the honest, and the family part,'' said
Dot Wiggin Semprini, 52, a mother of two and part-time housecleaner
whose recent musical career has been limited to a church handbell
choir.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't somebody say innocent, or something?'' said Betty
Wiggin Porter, 49, who works as a group manager in a kitchen
equipment warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the word I was looking for,'' said her sister.
``Innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are some of the nicer words that have been used to
describe the Shaggs' music. When they recorded ``Philosophy of the
World'' in 1969, the three sisters had had relatively little
musical instruction and asked their father to put off recording
until they were ready, but Austin Wiggin insisted. The album that
resulted is dissonant, arrhythmic and jarring from start to finish
_ a surreal contrast to naive lyrics like these from ``Who Are
Parents?'': Parents are the ones who really care/ Who are parents?/
Parents are the ones who are always there.
</P>
<P>
   The listener gets the impression that the artists are not only
unschooled in the techniques of conventional pop music, but that
they have never been allowed to hear it. Over the years, reviewers
have called the album ``stunningly awful,'' ``uncivilized,'' and,
in the New York Times, ``the best worst rock album ever made.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Village Voice critic Lester Bangs likened Dorothy's
guitar playing to ``14 pocket combs being run through a moose's
dorsal'' and Helen's drumming to ``a peg-leg stumbling through a
field of bald Uniroyals.''
</P>
<P>
   But to a network of musical explorers desperate to shake
conventional influences, the Wiggins' nerve-jangling quality was
like catnip. Kurt Cobain, the lead singer of Nirvana who committed
suicide in 1994, was said to have listened to ``Philosophy of the
World'' as a ritual every morning. Downtown filmmaker Harmony
Korine, best known for the film ``Kids,'' paid homage by naming
characters in ``Gummo'' after the Wiggin sisters. Breathless Web
sites devoted to the Shaggs have sprung up like mushrooms, praising
``the spastic magic in these grooves'' and saluting the sisters'
``pure desire and drive. No talent necessary . . . . This is what
punk is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   All this has caused some bafflement in Fremont, where the Shaggs
played through the early '70s. The girls' father, a textile worker,
had pulled them out of the local high school so they could focus on
their music, which he felt was destined to make them famous. Jeff
Landrock, who was a sound engineer at the Fleetwood Studio in
Revere, Mass., where they recorded their second album in 1975,
recalled the girls' frozen looks when their father brought them
into the studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of weird,'' he said. ``They didn't say anything.
There was zero personality. It kind of looked like they didn't want
to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Their primary venue was Fremont Town Hall, where the fire chief,
Dick Heselton, 54, used to guard their Saturday night concerts for
$5 a night. Heselton remembered their music as ``rotten . . . (but)
catchy at times'' and said he chose to stand guard outside. Dick
Maloof, 54, said he has never developed a taste for the music, but
has watched the ebb and flow of ``Shagg-mania'' for the 30 years
he's lived here.
</P>
<P>
   ``These fans, I don't think they're people from Fremont who are
lining up to see them,'' Maloof said. ``All I can understand is
there's something about the lyrics to the songs, people think
they're Bob Dylanish or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of this sense of mystery is shared by the former Shaggs
themselves, who so thoroughly walked away from pop music that until
last year, many of their friends didn't know they had ever played
instruments. A fourth sister, Rachel Wiggin (now Gould), who
occasionally joined her older sisters on bass, kept her distance
from the band when other high school students teased her about the
music. Fred Semprini, who married Dorothy Wiggin, used to badger
his wife to play her album, but she would not allow it on the
stereo while she was in the house.
</P>
<P>
   But the reissue of ``Philosophy of the World'' last year, urged
by Terry Adams, keyboardist for the band NRBQ, set off a chain of
events that culminated in a bidding war over the film rights to
their life stories. At Adams's urging, Semprini and Porter agreed
to get up on stage at the Bowery Ballroom in New York last
November, although Helen Wiggin Bickford, who suffers from
depression, was not able to join them. The sisters signed
autographs for upward of an hour that night, and since then have
made contacts with a line of famous rock musicians without knowing
precisely who they are.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Shaggs' most evangelical promoters, for instance, was
Frank Zappa, who called ``Philosophy of the World'' ``better than
the Beatles.'' In a recent interview, Semprini asked a reporter if
Zappa's music could be described as ``heavy metal,'' and racked her
brain for the name of a bass player who had befriended her.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that band? RMB?'' she asked, and finally came up with
REM.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't he the one who helped me get onto that high stool?''
asked their mother, Annie Wiggin, 73. ``He just picked me up and
stuck me on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Semprini laughed. ``I didn't know REM,'' she said. ``But they
knew us.''
</P>
<P>
   And they are rapidly becoming familiar with the entertainment
business. Since a magazine article last year sparked interest from
the film industry, the sisters have bolstered their flanks with two
new lawyers, one a film and movie specialist and one a music lawyer
who is helping them trace the rights to songs they had long ago
forgotten about. Several months ago, they opted to sell the rights
to their life stories to Artisan Entertainment, an independent film
company specializing in edgy projects like the upcoming ``Blair
Witch 2: Book of Shadows'' and John Waters's ``Cecil B. DeMented.''
According to Artisan, production on the film will begin early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Semprini said the sisters have not made any profit from the
revival of interest in them, and only stand to do so if the movie
plans are realized.
</P>
<P>
   But even if they are, artists like the Shaggs will never really
be part of the world that embraces them, said Irwin Chusit, who
showcased the band in his new book ``Songs in the Key of Z: The
Curious Universe of Outsider Music.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of being an outsider is you're not really going to
change _ I don't mean this in a demeaning way, but kind of like the
Beverly Hillbillies,'' he said. ``If the Shaggs go to Hollywood
they could go to every A-list party in the Hills and meet David
Geffen and Stephen Spielberg, and they're still going to be
outsiders by nature . . . bless their hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, some have hesitated to bring the sisters into the
public eye because of that. In his book, Chusit recounts a visit to
a mid-1970s Shaggs concert by a Boston music executive who was
interested in arranging live performances or maybe a record deal.
When he arrived at Fremont Town Hall, Harry Palmer found locals
dancing in ``a clumsy, arrhythmic, `Night of the Living Dead' sort
of way,'' and approached Austin Wiggin with a delicate question:
Didn't he understand that there were people who were laughing at
the Shaggs? Finally, Palmer went home without making a deal,
convinced that promoting the Shaggs to the wider public would be
the worst kind of exploitation, since they ``didn't know they were
being ridiculed,'' Chusit wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But 30 years later, the adult Shaggs, who now live in Epping,
seem serene in the face of their detractors: Everyone is entitled
to their opinion, and the true artists all like the music, Semprini
said. Gould, 46, of Maine, who was embarrassed of the band during
her teen years, now says that people who don't like the music
``just don't take the time to understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Wiggin sisters know what their audience is
looking for, and it's not skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want us to be good. They want us to be like we were
on the record,'' said Semprini.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if they could possibly re-create that chaotic sound,
Porter said she supposed they could.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not any better,'' she said, with a tiny smile.

 HE'S THE DOMINICANS' HERO ON THE R.I. BALLOT  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He looked into the eyes of strangers, in a city 1,500 miles
away, a long-shot wannabe congressman short on cash. But at this
fundraiser in Miami, Angel Taveras stood before his people, meaning
he could forget _ for now _ being an everyman politican.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dominicano soy,'' Taveras bellowed. ``I am Dominican.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing lyrics from merengue crooner Fernandito Villalona,
Taveras continued, as the throngs of Dominican-Americans jumped to
their feet: ``I will never forget my roots. No matter how high I
climb, I will not forget my people!''
</P>
<P>
   In an instant, that Saturday in July, checkbooks flipped open.
Money poured into his campaign chest, adding to the thousands he's
gotten from fundraisers in Washington; New Jersey; New York.
</P>
<P>
   Taveras's face has been splashed on the front-page of newspapers
in the Dominican Republic. He's a household name among Dominicans
living in the United States. As the first Dominican-American to run
for Congress, he's hailed as the Great Dominican Hope.
</P>
<P>
   Back in his home state of Rhode Island, though, Taveras seems a
different man. There, outside of the small, but fast growing
Dominican community, he's relatively unknown and is said to have
little chance of winning the September 12 primary.
</P>
<P>
   Here, he does not shout ``Dominicano soy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a Latino candidate. I am not a Dominican candidate,''
he says with passion. ``I want to represent all people.''
</P>
<P>
   When Portugese-Americans ask, ``Taveras? Are you Portugese?'' he
tells them, with a wink, ``Of course.'' And if an Italian-American
asks the same question, he conjures similiar replies.
</P>
<P>
   Taveras said he doesn't change his persona to fit the audience,
but he knows he can't afford to come across as too Latino.
Hispanics make up just 5.1 percent of the district, with Dominicans
being a 1.6 percent chunk; plus they comprise an even lower
percentage of voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being latino has been an issue that continues to come up,''
Taveras said. ``I'm always concerned that people are going to box
me in. I am proud of my heritage and I wouldn't change that for
anything in the world. But I am much more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Providence, and New York City, Dominicans are the
single largest incoming immigrant group. And they are the fastest
growing, too. In New York City, more Dominican babies were born
last year than any other ethnic group, according to tabulations by
the Dominican Studies Institute at the City College of New York.
</P>
<P>
   But Dominicans, as a bloc, do not vote in large numbers. Though
they contribute heavily to politicians in the homeland, they're
just beginning to use their growing wealth on US candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Dominicans raised $50,000 last October during two days of
fundraising in Greater Boston for Hipolito Mejia, who won the
presidency in the Dominican Republic. Scores of Dominican
immigrants flew from East Coast cities to the island on election
day to vote in the presidential elections. Mejia's party, the
Dominican Revolutionary Party, has a store-front headquarters in
Boston's Jamaica Plain neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   When Taveras speaks to other Dominicans, he scolds them, tells
them they can no longer focus just on homeland politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``People know more about politics back home than they do here,''
Taveras said. ``They can tell you in a second who is the vice
president of the Dominican Republic, but they can't always name the
vice president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Taveras spends most of his days traveling through Rhode Island's
Second Congressional district. As Taveras's campaign becomes a
rising call for Dominicans throughout the United States, the total
amount of out-of-state donations has edged out in-state
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   His last filing with the Federal Elections Commission shows 83
percent of donations came from outside Rhode Island. Just $1,045
came from his state, compared to $6,230 from New Jersey and $3,550
from New York. He's raised $120,000 so far, a quarter of the amount
of the candidate with the largest campaign chest.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction to his campaign has been jolting.
</P>
<P>
   Mejia called Taveras at home to invite him to his inauguration.
Spanish-language newspapers throughout the East Coast have run
profiles. Dominican Festivals, including one in Boston next month,
invite him to be a guest speaker. Strangers _ all of them Latino,
most of them Dominican _ plan fundraisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't expecting this outpouring,'' Taveras said.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Taveras, Dominican-Americans are running for the
Rhode Island State Senate, and for two seats in the New York State
Assembly. Backers give an almost knee-jerk embrace to the
candidates, because they so desperately want someone of their own
in office, any office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited because this kid, he's the future,'' said
entrepreneur Tony Barros of Jamaica Plain, a Dominican-American who
is one of Boston's most politically-connected Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   Taveras, who turns 30 next month, believes he can win. That's
because his whole life has been a crap shoot: raised by a single
mother in one of Providence's poorest neighborhoods, attended
public schools. Partly due to his mother's influence, and his shy,
bookish persona, he attended Harvard, then Georgetown Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, he wore ``Steve Urkel'' glasses _ the name of the
nerdy character on the TV sitcom ``Family Matters.'' But he's
traded those in for Ralph Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   If his corporate attire gives one impression, his taste in music
and food, reveals another. He keeps the merengue music in his
mother's forest green Comanche playing. He comes home to a
Dominican meal every night, that his girlfriend, who is also
Dominican, prepares. He says he can never get enough deep-fried
chicken with heaps of pink beans on white rice.
</P>
<P>
   When he's on the phone with a non-Latino he uses his
Yankee-inflected voice. But if he's talking to another Latino, he
gives warm greetings like, ``Hola, hermano'' (hello, brother), all
in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Just the other day, as he was making a round of calls, asking
for support, he reached a Latino attorney in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like, `You're the one! I heard of you,' '' Taveras
recounted. Before they hung up, he told him he would send him a
check.
</P>
<P>
   Another $200. More outside money for the Dominican underdog.

   Circuits stories from The N.Y. Times News Service for Thursday,
Aug. 17:
</P>
<P>
   CIR-ISP (Undated) _ In praise of the small Internet Service
Provider. ISP's like Sonic, which serves a few thousand people in
Sonoma County, Calif., were common in the early 1990s. But in the
past five years or so, many of the smallest ones have disappeared
while AOL and a handful of others have undergone explosive growth.
By numbers alone, the Web service business doesn't look so dire.
Boardwatch magazine, which tracks ISP's, recently reported more
than 7,400 providers in North America, an increase of roughly 2,000
over last year. But those numbers reflect the changing nature of
the business itself. By Katie Hafner.
</P>
<P>
   CIR-MATES-ONLINE (Undated) _ Harsha Kumar, a 29-year-old
technology officer for an e-commerce company in Westborough, Mass.,
wanted to find a wife. And Mr. Kumar, who was born in India and
educated in the United States, wanted to begin his search in a way
that blended both Old and New World sensibilities. ``I knew I
wanted to marry an Indian or Indian-American woman, but arranged
marriage seemed unnatural to me,'' Kumar said. ``Meeting someone
online seemed more natural to me, maybe because I work in
e-commerce and am on the Internet and using e-mail a lot already.''
In January 1998, Kumar signed up with Internet Matrimonials
(matrimonials.com), a service for people of South Asian heritage.
Traditionally, many South Asians have arranged marriages through
relatives or ``marriage bureaus,'' paid matchmakers sometimes
called bride brokers, and publications like India Abroad and The
Times of India have published classified ads usually placed by
parents for serious prospective brides and grooms. In the last few
years, matrimonial Web sites have started up. By Reena Jana.

   CIR-BOTS (Undated) _ They are called shopbots, buybots,
pricebots or just plain bots _ the ``bot'' is short for robot. The
name is playful, but the reality is all business because shopbots
are meant to roam the Web all by themselves one day, efficiently
buying and selling goods and services for people and companies. An
infinite number of shopbots, each a piece of software, are expected
to show up as electronic commerce expands. One of the more
conservative estimates is that there will be hundreds of millions
of them. They will resemble today's relatively simple consumer
shopbots, personalized computer programs that bid on buyers' behalf
at auctions or go out on the Web to find the best prices on jeans,
but they will be far smarter and faster. By Anne Eisenberg.

<P>
   DECORATOR-COSTS (Undated) _ Unlike other business relationships,
services a decorator renders to a client are often impossible to
pin down. There is no right way or wrong way to decorate a room.
Nor can a price tag be put on taste, or a so-called ``good eye.''
Add to the psychological imbalance the mind-boggling complexity and

<P>
   TV-SKYBOX (Los Angeles) _ If the role of the contemporary
political convention has undergone a radical transformation, from
procedural forum to multi-media spectacle, so has the role of the
modern network skybox. Once little more than a spartan cave from
which the likes of Chet Huntley or Walter Cronkite could look out

Cook County and Brooklyn, the booth has become a statement unto

Bartlett's mother, who shaped the domestic aesthetic of various

   TIBOR-DESIGN (New York) _ Since Tibor Kalman was a friend of
mine, I'm not able to write an objective review of ``Tiborocity:
Design and Undesign by Tibor Kalman'' the New Museum of
Contemporary Art's lively retrospective of the late graphic
designer's work. But I'd feel idiotic if I didn't write a personal
story before the show comes down this weekend. ``Tiborocity'' had
me shadowboxing with my friend over some of the issues we used to
argue about. What is sensibility? What was Visual Culture? How do
you maintain, or even measure integrity in the consumer society?
Those are a few of the issues we didn't exhaust in Tibor's
lifetime. Continuing the conversation is my way of remembering him.

   CHINA-SCULPTOR (Beijing) _ With a typically enigmatic

   SALZBURG-MUSIC (Salzburg, Austria) _ The Finnish composer Kaija
Saariaho had never considered writing an opera until 1992, when she

   YAJALON, MEXICO _ Pigs snorted in mud and a chilly rain soaked
the mountains outside as Nicolas Lopez described how armed men
staged a terrifying raid on his hamlet earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Firing weapons into the air, the invaders claimed rights to the
villagers' land, setting fire to five huts, chasing about 30
families into hiding, and looting what little corn and clothes the
peasants had, Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as he shivered at the memory, Lopez managed a smile. On
Sunday(8/20) the Mayan Indian will vote in a historic election for
the new governor of Chiapas, one of Mexico's most impoverished and
volatile states. And if pre-election opinion polls are accurate,
Mexico's 71-year-old ruling party is headed for another defeat
after being trounced in July 2's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are waiting for a solution to our problems,'' said Lopez,
who will vote for Pablo Salazar, candidate of an opposition
alliance that could unseat Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary
Party, the PRI, from a state considered a barometer of social
justice in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Chiapas is home to the Zapatista Indian rebels, who launched an
insurrection against the Mexican government here in January 1994
that still hasn't been resolved. Since that time, armed
paramilitary groups loyal to the ruling party have also evolved,
periodically attacking Zapatista sympathizers like Lopez's hamlet.
</P>
<P>
   ``All government ties to these paramilitary groups will end (if
the PRI loses). One way to dismantle these groups is to simply not
guarantee them impunity any longer,'' said a sweat-soaked Salazar,
pausing for an interview and quick lunch during one of his final
grueling all-day campaign swings along Chiapas' sweltering tropical
coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are fed up and want change. And change is contagious,''
he said, waving at a marimba band in a restaurant that played a
song as a tribute to the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But Chiapas is considered a bulwark state for the PRI, and its
candidate, Sami David, has counted on a sympathetic state media
establishment that, as usual, offered slavishly favorable coverage
to him. A cordial man who is warm one-on-one, David also touched a
traditionally conservative nerve here with a campaign warning that
a Salazar victory could provoke even more instability.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Chiapas, an era of stability is at stake,'' David told a
recent gathering of PRI youth in the capital city of Tuxtla
Gutierrez.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the northern part of Chiapas is a checkerboard of Mayan
Indian villages divided between Zapatistas and PRI loyalists who
sporadically clash over land rights and political differences. The
collection of huts where Lopez lived _ nestled in rugged hills
above the city of Yajalon (pronounced, ``ya-ha-LONE'') _ was
eventually occupied by Mexican Army troops. But since the villagers
also fear the army, they refused to return.
</P>
<P>
   The election of Mexican President-elect Vicente Fox has sparked
hope for a peaceful resolution to the cycle of violence. Fox
ousted, for the first time in seven decades, the PRI, which the
Zapatistas blame for the squalid conditions the southern state's
Indians live in.
</P>
<P>
   Before the July 2 election, Subcommander Marcos, the primary
Zapatista spokesman, issued a statement reiterating the rebels'
position that they would negotiate again if a peace accord signed
in 1996 is implemented and federal troops are withdrawn from Indian
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is a promoter of free-market economic policies, which the
Zapatistas oppose, but he has pledged to revive negotiations with
the rebels and send Mexico's Congress the stalled 1996 accord that
grants sweeping Indian rights. If elected, Salazar could also set
an example that change can be forced at the ballot box rather than
at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one, not even the most radical person in the country can
dispute the legitimacy of a Fox government,'' Salazar said,
predicting that the Zapatistas can't dismiss electoral change.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent campaign stop in the gritty border town of Hidalgo
on the Guatemala border, supporters were enraptured with Salazar's
pledge to address the demands of the poor _ including the
Zapatistas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Zapatistas said our fight is against being forgotten. They
said there is a worse death than dying from diarrhea or from
curable diseases,'' the candidate shouted from the stage to wild
cheers. ``There is a worse death, say our Indian brothers, and that
is the death that comes from being forgotten. Well, you people are
about to do something about that painful reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Salazar is a federal senator and former member of the PRI, which
he says used to be the only option available to someone who wanted
to get into political office. But he left the party in May 1999
after a long string of disputes over the government's handling of
the Chiapas conflict.
</P>
<P>
   He is unaffiliated now, but is representing a four-party
alliance that includes Fox's conservative National Action Party, or
PAN, and the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, the PRD. The two
parties clash ideologically, but for the purpose of defeating the
PRI in Chiapas they pooled their funds and worked hand-in-hand for
Salazar.
</P>
<P>
   An exhausted-looking David said he isn't giving up, and he
dismisses polls like one conducted by Reforma newspapers, which
gave Salazar a 9-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Chiapas, the conditions to avoid confrontations or even
social collapse are being constructed with great difficulty,'' he
said an interview with Cox Newspapers. He had a badly bruised and
swollen ear, the result of an injury when someone threw a metal
weight at him in Salazar's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a platform for electoral reform,'' he insisted. ``The
offers for change have to be based on clarity and not on
deception.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI's presidential candidate, Francisco Labastida, won in
Chiapas last month. But Salazar is counting on the combined votes
of the PAN and the PRD to carry him to victory. His campaign pos
peasant farmers, Fox is now seen as Mexico's new ``tlatoani,'' the
Aztec word for ``maximum leader,'' Salazar campaign aide Mauricio
Gandara said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know that the 'Papa PRI' has died now. So they are
wondering who will be managing the money and resources. They are
thinking that now there is a 'Papa Fox,''' Gandara said. ``This is
the product of 71 years of domination by one party.''
</P>
<P>
   Araceli Burguete, a Chiapas sociologist, said the PRI still
controls many Indians in the state. It will probably be business as
usual in Indian towns where the local PRI leader habitually orders
residents how to vote, she said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But even in PRI strongholds, some residents appeared to be
bracing for change.
</P>
<P>
   Chenalrabian Nights' Entertainments.''
</P>
<P>
   That observation was made in 1908, but it still fits a city that
manages, amid its modernity, to stay alive with elegant detail.
</P>
<P>
   Cats slumber across finely carved tables with inlaid
mother-of-pearl oyster shell. Thick vines dangle over the walls of
the Old City. Diners smoke water pipes and sip tea in tile-lined
courtyards around quiet fountains. Swordmakers discuss their
ancient craft even as they consider advertising on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As Syria slowly opens to the west, a small but growing number of
Americans are getting to know the exotic city of about 3 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   Damascus prides itself as the oldest capital in the world _
going back at least 5,000 years _ and as a showcase of Arab
tradition. It shows itself off with sometimes grand, and sometimes
funky flourishes. For the former, there's the stately tomb of
Saladin (pronounced, ``sala-DEEN''), probably the most heroic,
non-religious, Muslim figure in all history.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's the army museum, where the power might go out as
you wander between the run-down artillery, tanks, rifles and the
dusty exhibit on Syrian Hamad Feris, who joined Soviet cosmonauts
in space. One of the few English signs at the exit states, with no
apparent irony, ``Tanks(CQ) for your visit.''
</P>
<P>
   For travelers, Syria is largely crime free. Arabic is the common
language and many Syrians also speak French. There are few
proficient English speakers, but some taxi drivers or hotel staff
will know a few words.
</P>
<P>
   Americans need to get a Syrian visa before departing. Those can
be obtained in about a week from Syrian embassies or consulates.
Syria still does not recognize Israel and will not grant visas to
people with Israeli stamps in their passports.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian countryside is flush with archeological digs and
dozens of Crusader and Muslim castles. But the capital offers a
sampling of the great mix of cultures to come through this corner
of the Mediterranean. It's also a shopping wonder, offering rugs,
furniture and metal work from around the Middle East and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   A good place to start is the walled Old City. It's a large,
working district where Syrians shop for everything from clothes to
dehydrated Newts. Sold in jars in the medicinal herb stalls, a
paste of the little lizards is supposed to cure ills and provide
sexual vigor.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to other exotic venues where the locals serve the
tourists, in Damascus' Old City, the relatively few tourists and
locals line up together at the prime spots.
</P>
<P>
   That can be at Bakdash, a crowded ice cream parlor. It sells a
delicious firm ice cream that, for some reason, requires loud
pounding by fit men with wooden hammers.
</P>
<P>
   Or, it can be at the mausoleum of Saladin. He was the Muslim
general who ruled over most of the Arab world and drove the
European Crusaders out of Jerusalem. While his Crusader opponent,
England's Richard the Lion-Hearted, was known for brutality,
Saladin was honorable.
</P>
<P>
   He died in 1192 in Damascus. Though he is a hero of the Arabs,
he was an ethnic Kurd. You can still find Kurds _ who are mostly in
Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria _ visiting the tomb today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the leader who conquered places taken by the
foreigners,'' said Kurd Ali Mohammed, 21, a laborer in Damascus.
``He was very powerful, but he was also very merciful.''
</P>
<P>
   There are actually two tombs. A faded box of carved,
walnut-colored wood appears to be the original. In 1899, Germany's
Kaiser Wilhelm II added a marble tomb beside it, in honor of
Saladin.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of streets away is the mausoleum of another central
figure in Middle Eastern history, Sultan Baibars (pronounced,
``BAY-bears''). He was the Mamluke ruler who, before his death in
1277, defeated the Mongols and almost finished off the Crusaders
who had hung on after Saladin. He was violent and unforgiving, but
his tomb is decorated with the palaces and lush plants awaiting him
in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the Old City is the Omayyad Mosque, a huge
courtyard bordered by a large prayer hall built around 708 A.D.
Inside and out are mosaics of glass beads from as far back as the
12th Century.
</P>
<P>
   The mingling between Islam and Christianity is apparent. The
mosque's minaret towers include the Jesus tower, where locals
believe he will return on judgment day. Inside the mosque is a
shrine to John the Baptist, revered and called Yahia by Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the mosque should remove their shoes, but keep their
arms and legs covered or borrow the robes offered at the ticket
office.
</P>
<P>
   The Old City also offers a Christian landmark. The underground
Chapel of Ananias is named after a disciple of Jesus who is
believed to have lived there. Ananias was ordered, according to the
New Testament, to go to ``the street can see Syria's ancient
history in the National Museum. Most explanations are in Arabic and
French, but the museum is excellent. Most interesting are the
expressive, big-eyed statuettes carveo stop and dash off some
postcards in the museum's tranquil archeological garden. Here,
under trees that quiet the city bustle outside the walls, you can
stroll amid detailed relief sculptures and statues that form the
foundations of today's Damascus.

 &HT;    `Bette' sitcom could be divine or a miss
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - The Divine Miss M is going to squeeze her
oversized persona onto the small screen this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Although petite in stature, Bette Midler always seems bigger
than life, so the burning question is whether CBS's new sitcom,
``Bette,'' will blast off or bomb. Television has a long history of
rejecting movie and theater actors who loom large. Remember all the
failed attempts by James Earl Jones? Gene Wilder and Dabney Coleman
had tough runs, too.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Bette'' pilot has been generally well-received by critics.
Midler plays herself in a sitcom that pokes fun at her career, her
aging diva image in a youth-obsessed show business and her
real-life role as a wife and mother. There's some hilarious
physical shtick, which Midler does with ease, as well as some
vintage Midler singing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gee, I hope I won't be too far off the mark,'' Midler told TV
critics in a satellite press conference from Italy, where she was
vacationing with her husband, Martin von Haselberg, and 13-year-old
daughter, Sophie. ``It's a role I'm pretty comfortable with. A lot
of people have pitched ideas at me, but this was the truest.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS executives are high on ``Bette,'' but the show has drawn an
unenviable time slot - Wednesdays opposite ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire.'' It will take more than a good show and Midler's
famous name to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to promote, promote, promote, flog, flog, flog,''
she said laughing. ``Maybe Regis will get struck by lightning.''
</P>
<P>
   Midler, 54, has had a wild ride throughout her career, starting
with her offbeat stage shows and continuing through her more
mainstream recording and acting jobs. Her first album, ``The Divine
Miss M,'' went platinum and won a Grammy. She was nominated for an
Oscar for her first major role in ``The Rose'' but lost to Sally
Field (for ``Norma Rae'') _ a disappointment that's a running gag
in the sitcom pilot.
</P>
<P>
   If she wanted to, Midler could use her show to settle some old
scores in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I don't plan to do that at all,'' she said, wagging her
finger and allowing a sly smile to creep across her face. ``But if
it happens that way, it'd be great, wouldn't it? We'll be poking
fun at Hollywood, and I'd like to go as far as I can _ as far as
the network will let me go, which I assume will be pretty far. I've
had some very funny things happen to me and encountered some odd
people. I have a trunk full of stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Midler says she doesn't watch much TV _ just ``The Sopranos''
and ``Sex and the City'' on HBO, ``I Love Lucy'' reruns on
Nickelodeon and ``Friends'' on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I avoid anything that's saccharine or overly sentimental,''
she said. ``I like dry humor and physical humor.''
</P>
<P>
   But she's no stranger to the medium. She starred in several
splashy specials, including ``Clams on the Half Shell'' and ``Ol'
Red Hair Is Back,'' and guest starred on several sitcoms. She won
an Emmy for her touching guest stint on Johnny Carson's ``Tonight
Show'' farewell.
</P>
<P>
   Midler counts Jack Benny, George Burns and Jerry Seinfeld (all
of whom played themselves) among her TV heroes. And she's a huge
fan of Lucille Ball. What she hopes will distinguish her show from
other semiautobiographical series is music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a very firm intention to sing on this show,'' she said.
``There hasn't been a lot of pop music in sitcoms. That's something
special we can bring. I have a lot of songs and a lot of costumes
from the 30 years I've been in the business.''
</P>
<P>
   In the pilot, Bette is racked with self-doubt about her new
concert, her fading youth and her husband, who falls asleep while
she's putting on a sexy nightie one evening. One of the funniest
scenes in the pilot has Bette visiting a plastic surgeon for a
consultation and having her eyelids taped up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a good sense of what will embarrass my family,'' Midler
said. ``They're very good sports. They say, if it's funny I should
go for it. They liked the pilot, although they thought certain
things could be punched up. You know, everybody has an opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Midler has been scanning series scripts for years and decided to
do one now because Sophie is entering high school this fall, and
she wanted to be home for her daughter's ``tumultuous years.'' As
it turns out, however, filming will split the family for a while.
The show will be based in Los Angeles, rather than New York, where
the Midler trio lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crew and the rest of the cast didn't want to leave Los
Angeles, so I thought it would be better not to uproot everybody
else just so I could stay home,'' said Midler, who isn't the
flaming diva she's cracked up to be.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in real life, Midler is nothing like her stage persona.
She works tirelessly for AIDS awareness, literacy and environmental
causes, and she considers herself something of a homebody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a quiet soul who loves a good laugh,'' she said. ``My
behind-the-scenes life is pretty serious. I've been working hard to
lighten up a bit, but it's not easy, especially at my age.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``Bette'' clicks, Midler may take a break from plowing
through movie scripts. Like a lot of women her age, she's been
frustrated not only by the quality but also by the process of
moviemaking in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to wait 15 years in development and then try to get
the OK from some 25-year-old,'' she said. ``Forget about it. When
they learn to make movies, I'll be back.''

 c.2000 The Independent, London  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   LONDON _ Just an hour's (slow) drive from San Gimignano, where
Prime Minister Tony Blair has been holidaying in his borrowed
Tuscan fortress, are half a dozen Italian towns that are trying to
slow down the pace of life.
</P>
<P>
   They are members of the ``Slow City'' movement, where towns sign
up to a series of measures designed to make life calmer and hence
more enjoyable for citizens and visitors alike.
</P>
<P>
   So far there are 32 towns in Italy that have joined the scheme,
which grew out of the ``Slow Food'' plan of the early Eighties.
That was a reaction to Americanized fast food, the idea being that
people should eat delicious meals, and take all afternoon doing it,
instead of bolting down a hamburger on the hoof.
</P>
<P>
   These Slow Cities are coping with traffic by enlarging
pedestrian areas and building car parking lots on the edge. They
are planting more trees in parks, banning car alarms, and taking
down TV aerials, posters and neon signs.
</P>
<P>
   If you detect a tinge of anti-Americanism, even xenophobia, in
all this you would be right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American urban model,'' protests Paolo Saturnini, the
mayor of Greve in Chianti (just 30 miles from San Gimignano), ``has
invaded our cities and risks making Italian towns look the same. We
want to stop this kind of globalization.''
</P>
<P>
   Other aspects of anti-globalization in these include banning
genetically-modified foods and promoting locally produced organic
food in restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   But these cities are not against progress in the sense that they
are anti-technology; in fact they argue that technology, properly
applied, ought to make life easier and more relaxed. They are, so
to speak, anti-McDonald's rather than anti-Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us would applaud the idea, but short of high-tailing it
to Tuscany, what can we do about it? In any case, going slow while
on vacation is not the problem for most of us: it is how to slow
down our daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Slow Cities project touches a nerve because one of the
growing divisions in our society is not about money but about time:
between the time-rich and the time-poor.
</P>
<P>
   Some time-richness is involuntary: that of the unemployed or the
early retired. And some of the time-poor have chosen to be that
way: whatever they might say, they regard being busy as a sign of
status.
</P>
<P>
   But for most of us there is a genuine problem of balance: how do
we get our work done, fulfill our social and family obligations,
have fun, and still find time to slope about doing nothing?
</P>
<P>
   We will all have our own ideas, but the Slow Cities movement
can, I suggest, teach us some principles of how we might do so.
</P>
<P>
   For example, part of the slowing down is not so much slowing,
but calming.
</P>
<P>
   One of the key aspects of the Italian cities' plan is to cut
down on noise _ understandably in view of the Vespa/mobile phone
culture of the Italian young.
</P>
<P>
   This holds a lesson for us here. While we cannot do anything
about the booming stereo in the next car at the traffic lights, we
can create more calm by not inflicting noise on ourselves when we
don't need to. Turn down the telly. Throw out the Walkman.
</P>
<P>
   But while cutting down on noise may help take pressure off
people, it doesn't solve the time problem. How do we create more
downtime for ourselves? Everyone will have lots of tricks they have
learned that enable them to save time.
</P>
<P>
   A quick trawl of my colleagues suggests the following ideas. One
is to do the weekly supermarket shopping at 8 a.m. on a Saturday
morning when you can whisk around in half the usual time.
</P>
<P>
   A second is, whenever you see an object that would make a good
present, to buy it and stick it in a drawer. Then you have presents
ready for every occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, doing things at the last minute is also very
efficient. There was some economic study that looked at the time
taken to do routine tasks: the closer it was to the deadline, the
quicker the task was done.
</P>
<P>
   As a journalist I found the last idea particularly encouraging.
But I would like to offer two further suggestions. One takes a lot
of organization, costs money and is not an option for everyone; the
other can be done instantly by anyone and is free.
</P>
<P>
   The first is to cut commuting time. The sums are simple. On a
typical working day, we spend eight hours at work and eight hours
asleep. So that leaves only eight hours for everything else _ from
brushing one's teeth to making sure the fridge is stocked.
</P>
<P>
   If you then use another hour each way of that time commuting,
you have used up one-quarter of all the spare time during the day.
Given frequent traffic delays and the unreliability of public
transport, this is an enormous burden we place on ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   This is very much a modern burden: the word commuter is only
about 130 years old. Nearly all the additional time we gained in
the last century by shorter working hours, we lost in longer
commuting time.
</P>
<P>
   By a combination of living close to work (or working close to
where you live) and using the new technologies to do at least some
work at home, it should be possible for many people to trim the
time they spend going to and from work.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague who has just sold his apartment and is borrowing one
closer to our offices says he is astounded by the amount of time he
has suddenly discovered he has gained.
</P>
<P>
   But, as I said, not everyone has this option. The option that we
do all have can gain even more time. It is to give up watching
television.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest Social Trends, the average man in
Britain spends 24 hours a week watching television, the average
woman 26 hours. That is between three and four hours a day _ all of
which has to come out of the eight hours of leisure. No wonder
people feel they have no time.
</P>
<P>
   Are you out of touch if you don't watch the box? Not if you
listen to the radio and read the newspapers. Put a tablecloth over
it for a week and see what happens. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,075, OR CONTINUE TO 1,200) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Perhaps Tony Blair should try that one. If he vowed never to
watch TV and simply paid his PR people to watch it for him, think
of the time he could save.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he should pop over to Greve and have a beer with the
mayor. Don't hurry. Get one of those squads of bodyguards to do the
driving. Stop off at Castellina in Chianti on the way back and have
another beer. And reflect on the fact that is one of the things
vacations are for: to get new ideas on how to make life more
pleasant when you get back home. &QL;

<P>
   LONDON _ Just an hour's (slow) drive from San Gimignano, where
Prime Minister Tony Blair has been holidaying in his borrowed
Tuscan fortress, are half a dozen Italian towns that are trying to
slow down the pace of life.
</P>
<P>
   They are members of the ``Slow City'' movement, where towns sign
up to a series of measures designed to make life calmer and hence
more enjoyable for citizens and visitors alike.
</P>
<P>
   So far there are 32 towns in Italy that have joined the scheme,
which grew out of the ``Slow Food'' plan of the early Eighties.
That was a reaction to Americanized fast food, the idea being that
people should eat delicious meals, and take all afternoon doing it,
instead of bolting down a hamburger on the hoof.
</P>
<P>
   These Slow Cities are coping with traffic by enlarging
pedestrian areas and building car parking lots on the edge. They
are planting more trees in parks, banning car alarms, and taking
down TV aerials, posters and neon signs.
</P>
<P>
   If you detect a tinge of anti-Americanism, even xenophobia, in
all this you would be right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American urban model,'' protests Paolo Saturnini, the
mayor of Greve in Chianti (just 30 miles from San Gimignano), ``has
invaded our cities and risks making Italian towns look the same. We
want to stop this kind of globalization.''
</P>
<P>
   Other aspects of anti-globalization in these include banning
genetically-modified foods and promoting locally produced organic
food in restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   But these cities are not against progress in the sense that they
are anti-technology; in fact they argue that technology, properly
applied, ought to make life easier and more relaxed. They are, so
to speak, anti-McDonald's rather than anti-Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us would applaud the idea, but short of high-tailing it
to Tuscany, what can we do about it? In any case, going slow while
on vacation is not the problem for most of us: it is how to slow
down our daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Slow Cities project touches a nerve because one of the
growing divisions in our society is not about money but about time:
between the time-rich and the time-poor.
</P>
<P>
   Some time-richness is involuntary: that of the unemployed or the
early retired. And some of the time-poor have chosen to be that

leader. This extraordinary honor eventually went to a road near the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   As a kitten, Walter liked the sofa, even at the height of
General Aoun's lunatic bombardment of West Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   Where is Walter?, we would ask every time the shells started to
hiss over the house. I found her once, still sitting on the sofa,
following with her eyes the lights of the tracers and targeting
rounds as they flitted over the rooftop. One tough puss.
</P>
<P>
   The missile wire? Well back in 1993, in Israel's week-long
bombardment of southern Lebanon, I came across the guidance-wire of
a missile that had exploded in a truck. The wire interested me
because I suspected it may have been manufactured in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   So I took back around six feet of the brass cable and laid it on
my desk prior to sending it off to the Independent's defense
correspondent for examination. Which is where Walter found it one
afternoon. And ate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Missile wire?!'' the vet's wife shrieked in terror. Her
husband, Dr. Musri, saved Walter's life. Liquid paraffin was poured
into the beast and _ within hours _ the wire emerged from the wrong
end of Walter. I spared our defense correspondent what was left.
</P>
<P>
   Walter shrugged it off and returned to her favorite game _
playing with toy mice. Indeed, she enjoyed this so much that when a
real live mouse walked up the side of the balcony one day and
trotted across the floor past Walter's feet, she merely yawned.
</P>
<P>
   But she was a journalistic cat. She would snuggle down on
winter's evenings in my office, perched on top of copies of that
venerable old Lebanese journal ``L'Orient Le Jour,'' the only
newspaper to be written in Royalist French.
</P>
<P>
   Or sit like a teapot on the top of the UPS, the Uninterrupted
Power Supply system that every computer in Lebanon needs as a
backup when Netanyahu or Barak bomb the country's power stations.
</P>
<P>
   On one occasion Walter walked across the telephone and pressed
the automatic re-dial. I found her standing beside the machine with
a puzzled look as journalist John Cooley's voice crackled down the
line from Cyprus to demand why the caller was refusing to talk to
him.
</P>
<P>
   Walter could strike anywhere. And the old telex machine _ yes, I
was still filing on telex until the '90s _ became a bed for Walter,
its constantly running motor warming her underside night after
night, the messages from the Independent repeatedly garbled as the
paper messages _ unable to escape Walter's furry bulk _ hopelessly
overprinted.
</P>
<P>
   When I was punching telex tape, she would attack the tape,
ripping the holes with her claws.
</P>
<P>
   She could not escape journalism. And journalism couldn't escape
Walter.
</P>
<P>
   She was even named after a newspaper editor: Walter Wells of the
International Herald Tribune in Paris whose gutless refusal to
defend my journalist wife after the U.S. military lied about an
article she wrote for the paper prompted us to commemorate the
event in style.
</P>
<P>
   Returning from a Gulf war or southern Lebanon or Ireland, Walter
would always be there, waiting for her evening can of Whiskers in
the room where we stored the spare fuel for the generator.
</P>
<P>
   But when she went off her food in May, even the great Dr. Musri
could not find out what was wrong. Walter stopped purring and
skulked under a chair in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   After almost a week without food, I bundled her into her basket
and flew to Paris where two veterinarians were waiting for her.
</P>
<P>
   She sat meekly in her basket on the floor of Club Class. ``What
a well-behaved cat,'' the head of the Hariri Foundation charity
remarked from the neighboring seat. Neither of us knew that Walter
was dying.
</P>
<P>
   She had an enlarged heart, myocardia they said, and water on the
lungs was preventing her from eating. They drained the water and
for a few days Walter was back munching roast chicken. Then she
suffered a blood clot and the young female doctor said that she
might go into convulsions.
</P>
<P>
   It was the end. It took a few seconds for Walter to go limp and
an hour to cremate her. Under French law, her ashes had to remain
unscattered for a year and a day.
</P>
<P>
   But we broke the law and brought what was left of Walter back to
Beirut. And where the waves lap the green rocks below the house, we
threw her ashes, into the sea she watched so often and in which
live the fish she ate so many times.
</P>
<P>
   But I should have guessed that Walter's presence had not gone.
Not long after our return from Paris, the UPS started smoking as
the fan stopped at the back of the machine and everything I need as
a correspondent _ computer, phone re-charger, fax machine, printer
_ abruptly stopped working.
</P>
<P>
   A Lebanese technician lugged the heavy iron box away, only to
return hours later with a mass of brown and black fur in his hand.
``You have a cat?'' he asked. ``There was about a ton of fur
clogging the fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter had struck again. &QL;

<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria _ Whether they know it or not, when Westerners
try to conjure an image of fine Arab culture, it's probably close
to the courtyards and covered market streets of Syria's capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we go into the city,'' wrote travel writer Henry
Van Dyke, ``we step into a chapter of the 'Arabian Nights'
Entertainments.''
</P>
<P>
   That observation was made in 1908, but it still fits a city that
manages, amid its modernity, to stay alive with elegant detail.
</P>
<P>
   Cats slumber across finely carved tables with inlaid
mother-of-pearl oyster shell. Thick vines dangle over the walls of
the Old City. Diners smoke water pipes and sip tea in tile-lined
courtyards around quiet fountains. Swordmakers discuss their
ancient craft even as they consider advertising on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As Syria slowly opens to the west, a small but growing number of
Americans are getting to know the exotic city of about 3 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   Damascus prides itself as the oldest capital in the world _
going back at least 5,000 years _ and as a showcase of Arab
tradition. It shows itself off with sometimes grand, and sometimes
funky flourishes. For the former, there's the stately tomb of
Saladin (pronounced, ``sala-DEEN''), probably the most heroic,
non-religious, Muslim figure in all history.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's the army museum, where the power might go out as
you wander between the run-down artillery, tanks, rifles and the
dusty exhibit on Syrian Hamad Feris, who joined Soviet cosmonauts
in space. One of the few English signs at the exit states, with no
apparent irony, ``Tanks(CQ) for your visit.''
</P>
<P>
   For travelers, Syria is largely crime free. Arabic is the common
language and many Syrians also speak French. There are few
proficient English speakers, but some taxi drivers or hotel staff
will know a few words.
</P>
<P>
   Americans need to get a Syrian visa before departing. Those can
be obtained in about a week from Syrian embassies or consulates.
Syria still does not recognize Israel and will not grant visas to
people with Israeli stamps in their passports.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian countryside is flush with archeological digs and
dozens of Crusader and Muslim castles. But the capital offers a
sampling of the great mix of cultures to come through this corner
of the Mediterranean. It's also a shopping wonder, offering rugs,
furniture and metal work from around the Middle East and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   A good place to start is the walled Old City. It's a large,
working district where Syrians shop for everything from clothes to
dehydrated Newts. Sold in jars in the medicinal herb stalls, a
paste of the little lizards is supposed to cure ills and provide
sexual vigor.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to other exotic venues where the locals serve the
tourists, in Damascus' Old City, the relatively few tourists and
locals line up together at the prime spots.
</P>
<P>
   That can be at Bakdash, a crowded ice cream parlor. It sells a
delicious firm ice cream that, for some reason, requires loud
pounding by fit men with wooden hammers.
</P>
<P>
   Or, it can be at the mausoleum of Saladin. He was the Muslim
general who ruled over most of the Arab world and drove the
European Crusaders out of Jerusalem. While his Crusader opponent,
England's Richard the Lion-Hearted, was known for brutality,
Saladin was honorable.
</P>
<P>
   He died in 1192 in Damascus. Though he is a hero of the Arabs,
he was an ethnic Kurd. You can still find Kurds _ who are mostly in
Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria _ visiting the tomb today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the leader who conquered places taken by the
foreigners,'' said Kurd Ali Mohammed, 21, a laborer in Damascus.
``He was very powerful, but he was also very merciful.''
</P>
<P>
   There are actually two tombs. A faded box of carved,
walnut-colored wood appears to be the original. In 1899, Germany's
Kaiser Wilhelm II added a marble tomb beside it, in honor of
Saladin.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of streets away is the mausoleum of another central
figure in Middle Eastern history, Sultan Baibars (pronounced,
``BAY-bears''). He was the Mamluke ruler who, before his death in
1277, defeated the Mongols and almost finished off the Crusaders
who had hung on after Saladin. He was violent and unforgiving, but
his tomb is decorated with the palaces and lush plants awaiting him
in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the Old City is the Omayyad Mosque, a huge
courtyard bordered by a large prayer hall built around 708 A.D.
Inside and out are mosaics of glass beads from as far back as the
12th Century.
</P>
<P>
   The mingling between Islam and Christianity is apparent. The
mosque's minaret towers include the Jesus tower, where locals
believe he will return on judgment day. Inside the mosque is a
shrine to John the Baptist, revered and called Yahia by Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the mosque should remove their shoes, but keep their
arms and legs covered or borrow the robes offered at the ticket
office.
</P>
<P>
   The Old City also offers a Christian landmark. The underground
Chapel of Ananias is named after a disciple of Jesus who is
believed to have lived there. Ananias was ordered, according to the
New Testament, to go to ``the street which is called Straight'' to
heal a blind man. The Street Called Straight is still a main road
through the Old City.
</P>
<P>
   After sightseeing, tourists can join the genteel Arab elite in
Old City restaurants built around what used to be private palaces.
The Elizer and Arabesque restaurants are two fine examples where
you can dine on lamb kabobs and traditional yogurt stews.
</P>
<P>
   When you have enough of the living history in the Old City, you
can see Syria's ancient history in the National Museum. Most
explanations are in Arabic and French, but the museum is excellent.
Most interesting are the expressive, big-eyed statuettes carved by
the Canaanites, the pagan people who populated the region in 3000
B.C.
</P>
<P>
   There are also haunting relief statues from the Second Century
Roman period. Each depicts in personal detail men and women who had
been entombed behind them.
</P>
<P>
   The museum also contains a synagogue transported from Dura
Europus, near the Syrian-Iraqi border. Though nearly 1,800 years
old, the synagogue still holds colorful painted scenes from the
bible that brighten the small sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Museum visitors might want to stop and dash off some postcards
in the museum's tranquil archeological garden. Here, under trees
that quiet the city bustle outside the walls, you can stroll amid
detailed relief sculptures and statues that form the foundations of
today's Damascus.

   CIR-ISP (Undated) _ In praise of the small Internet Service
Provider. ISP's like Sonic, which serves a few thousand people in
Sonoma County, Calif., were common in the early 1990s. But in the
past five years or so, many of the smallest ones have disappeared
while AOL and a handful of others have undergone explosive growth.
By numbers alone, the Web service business doesn't look so dire.
Boardwatch magazine, which tracks ISP's, recently reported more
than 7,400 providers in North America, an increase of roughly 2,000
over last year. But those numbers reflect the changing nature of
the business itself. By Katie Hafner.

   CIR-MATES-ONLINE (Undated) _ Harsha Kumar, a 29-year-old
technology officer for an e-commerce company in Westborough, Mass.,
wanted to find a wife. And Mr. Kumar, who was born in India and
educated in the United States, wanted to begin his search in a way
that blended both Old and New World sensibilities. ``I knew I
wanted to marry an Indian or Indian-American woman, but arranged
marriage seemed unnatural to me,'' Kumar said. ``Meeting someone
online seemed more natural to me, maybe because I work in
e-commerce and am on the Internet and using e-mail a lot already.''
In January 1998, Kumar signed up with Internet Matrimonials
(matrimonials.com), a service for people of South Asian heritage.
Traditionally, many South Asians have arranged marriages through
relatives or ``marriage bureaus,'' paid matchmakers sometimes
called bride brokers, and publications like India Abroad and The
Times of India have published classified ads usually placed by
parents for serious prospective brides and grooms. In the last few
years, matrimonial Web sites have started up. By Reena Jana.

buying and selling goods and services for people and companies. An
infinite number of shopbots, each a piece of software, are expected
to show up as electronic commerce expands. One of the more
conservative estimates is that there will be hundreds of millions
of them. They will resemble today's relatively simple consumer

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   BEIRUT _ Walter was a street cat, a ``pusseini baladi'' as they
say in Beirut, brown and black with sharp ears and sharper teeth _
the only creature of its kind to consume part of an Israeli
wire-guided air-to-ground missile.
</P>
<P>
   On warm evenings, she would sit on the balcony and survey the
seafront Corniche, the coffee stalls and the Mediterranean as it
lapped idly against the green rocks below.
</P>
<P>
   She occasionally appeared in the pages of the Independent, not
least when it seemed certain that our seafront highway was to be
renamed Boulevard du President Hafez el-Assad after the Syrian
leader. This extraordinary honor eventually went to a road near the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   As a kitten, Walter liked the sofa, even at the height of
General Aoun's lunatic bombardment of West Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   Where is Walter?, we would ask every time the shells started to
hiss over the house. I found her once, still sitting on the sofa,
following with her eyes the lights of the tracers and targeting
rounds as they flitted over the rooftop. One tough puss.
</P>
<P>
   The missile wire? Well back in 1993, in Israel's week-long
bombardment of southern Lebanon, I came across the guidance-wire of
a missile that had exploded in a truck. The wire interested me
because I suspected it may have been manufactured in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   So I took back around six feet of the brass cable and laid it on
my desk prior to sending it off to the Independent's defense
correspondent for examination. Which is where Walter found it one
afternoon. And ate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Missile wire?!'' the vet's wife shrieked in terror. Her
husband, Dr. Musri, saved Walter's life. Liquid paraffin was poured
into the beast and _ within hours _ the wire emerged from the wrong
end of Walter. I spared our defense correspondent what was left.
</P>
<P>
   Walter shrugged it off and returned to her favorite game _
playing with toy mice. Indeed, she enjoyed this so much that when a
real live mouse walked up the side of the balcony one day and
trotted across the floor past Walter's feet, she merely yawned.
</P>
<P>
   But she was a journalistic cat. She would snuggle down on
winter's evenings in my office, perched on top of copies of that
venerable old Lebanese journal ``L'Orient Le Jour,'' the only
newspaper to be written in Royalist French.
</P>
<P>
   Or sit like a teapot on the top of the UPS, the Uninterrupted
Power Supply system that every computer in Lebanon needs as a
backup when Netanyahu or Barak bomb the country's power stations.
</P>
<P>
   On one occasion Walter walked across the telephone and pressed
the automatic re-dial. I found her standing beside the machine with
a puzzled look as journalist John Cooley's voice crackled down the
line from Cyprus to demand why the caller was refusing to talk to
him.
</P>
<P>
   Walter could strike anywhere. And the old telex machine _ yes, I
was still filing on telex until the '90s _ became a bed for Walter,
its constantly running motor warming her underside night after
night, the messages from the Independent repeatedly garbled as the
paper messages _ unable to escape Walter's furry bulk _ hopelessly
overprinted.
</P>
<P>
   When I was punching telex tape, she would attack the tape,
ripping the holes with her claws.
</P>
<P>
   She could not escape journalism. And journalism couldn't escape
Walter.
</P>
<P>
   She was even named after a newspaper editor: Walter Wells of the
International Herald Tribune in Paris whose gutless refusal to
defend my journalist wife after the U.S. military lied about an
article she wrote for the paper prompted us to commemorate the
event in style.
</P>
<P>
   Returning from a Gulf war or southern Lebanon or Ireland, Walter
would always be there, waiting for her evening can of Whiskers in
the room where we stored the spare fuel for the generator.
</P>
<P>
   But when she went off her food in May, even the great Dr. Musri
could not find out what was wrong. Walter stopped purring and
skulked under a chair in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   After almost a week without food, I bundled her into her basket
and flew to Paris where two veterinarians were waiting for her.
</P>
<P>
   She sat meekly in her basket on the floor of Club Class. ``What
a well-behaved cat,'' the head of the Hariri Foundation charity
remarked from the neighboring seat. Neither of us knew that Walter
was dying.
</P>
<P>
   She had an enlarged heart, myocardia they said, and water on the
lungs was preventing her from eating. They drained the water and
for a few days Walter was back munching roast chicken. Then she
suffered a blood clot and the young female doctor said that she
might go into convulsions.
</P>
<P>
   It was the end. It took a few seconds for Walter to go limp and
an hour to cremate her. Under French law, her ashes had to remain
unscattered for a year and a day.
</P>
<P>
   But we broke the law and brought what was left of Walter back to
Beirut. And where the waves lap the green rocks below the house, we
threw her ashes, into the sea she watched so often and in which
live the fish she ate so many times.
</P>
<P>
   But I should have guessed that Walter's presence had not gone.
Not long after our return from Paris, the UPS started smoking as
the fan stopped at the back of the machine and everything I need as
a correspondent _ computer, phone re-charger, fax machine, printer
_ abruptly stopped working.
</P>
<P>
   A Lebanese technician lugged the heavy iron box away, only to
return hours later with a mass of brown and black fur in his hand.
``You have a cat?'' he asked. ``There was about a ton of fur
clogging the fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter had struck again. &QL;

HOLLYWOOD HAS AN UN-CONVENTIONAL RESPONSE TO DEMS
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Weeks before the Academy Awards, Los Angeles
becomes an even more glamorous city. The streets are swept at least
three times a week, Oscar banners adorn almost every available
light pole from Beverly Hills to South Central LA, and sometimes
the smog even goes on holiday.
</P>
<P>
   All of this so that the entertainment industry can applaud
itself while commoners, who camp out for days in one of the more
dangerous neighborhoods, jockey for position to catch a fleeting
glimpse of Brad and Jennifer, Tom and Nicole, or Gwyneth and her
boyfriend du jour.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing like improving your self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   The same scenario is repeated on a lesser scale before the
Emmys, Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild Awards, Grammys, American
Music Awards and other celebratory events in which long, heartfelt
acceptance speeches are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, with the Democratic National Convention in town
for the first time since 1960, it doesn't look as if the City of
Angels has exactly rolled out the red carpet for Vice President Al
Gore, Sen. Joseph Lieberman and the party faithful. That's if you
don't count the new multimillion-dollar electronic LAX sign at the
airport and the red, white and blue lights at the top of the
Staples Center, where the convention is being held.
</P>
<P>
   The average Angeleno has greeted the convention with
indifference, or some resentment about traffic jams and other
impositions. Mayor Richard Riordan has been preoccupied with the
potential for violence by protesters and has had the police and
National Guard at the ready. The violence that marred the Lakers
NBA championship celebration in June is still fresh in the
collective memory.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a different story among the Hollywood set, which has an
ongoing love affair with politics. For celebrities, this has been
party week, with the entertainment industry pressing palms and
exchanging air kisses with Democrats from around the country. The
biggest affair was a $25,000-a-plate farewell to President Clinton,
but there have been numerous other festivities:
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Hefner has been holding bashes at the Playboy Mansion;
Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver hosted a bevy of A-listers
at their Pacific Palisades estate; Barbra Streisand honored the
Clintons with a brunch at her Malibu digs; producer Yvette Lee
Bowser (''Living Single, For Your Love'') welcomed members of the
Congressional Black Caucus to her Encino home; and producer
Lawrence Bender (''Pulp Fiction'') held a fund-raiser for
Christopher Reeve's foundation.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget the flap caused by Orange County Congresswoman
Loretta Sanchez, who scheduled a Latino ``Get Out to Vote'' party
at Hefner's mansion despite Gore's objections. Sanchez, who was
going to lose her opportunity to address the convention as a
result, eventually relented and moved the party to Universal
Studios.
</P>
<P>
   There was more. The cast of NBC's ``The West Wing'' whooped it
up on a Warner Brothers lot; Gov. Gray Davis hosted a shindig on
the back lot of Paramount Studios; Sony feted Democratic governors;
and DreamWorks, which contributed $1 million to the Gore campaign,
saluted female Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there has been a convention going on, and if you're
watching any of it on TV, you might catch a glimpse of celebrities
who have free passes to the luxury boxes at the Staples Center.
They include Streisand, Steven Spielberg, Whoopi Goldberg, Richard
Dreyfuss, Martin Sheen, Patricia Arquette, Sheryl Crow, Alec and
Billy Baldwin, Woody Harrelson, Ben Affleck, Ted Danson, Quentin
Tarantino, Rob Reiner, Tom Hanks, Harry Belafonte, Danny Glover,
Christopher Reeve and Warren Beatty, who thought about running for
president earlier in the year. The less privileged, by the way, had
to pay a cool million for a luxury box.
</P>
<P>
   The celebrities _ as they sometimes do in their Oscar and Emmy
acceptance speeches _ have been using the convention platform to
trumpet their causes. Arquette, Danson and Harrelson are among
those pushing for better education; Reiner's endorsing more funding
for children's programs; and Reeve continues his quest to raise
awareness about spinal injuries.
</P>
<P>
   California Congresswoman Maxine Waters says that the celebrities
are passionate about those issues. ``These are all very legitimate
concerns that shouldn't be disregarded because celebrities are
behind them,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But the convention isn't just a love-in. There is some
apprehension in Hollywood about the strong stance that Lieberman,
the Democratic vice presidential nominee, has taken in the past
against sex and violence in the movies. Jack Valenti, longtime
president of the Motion Picture Association of America, told
``Variety'' that there have been ``calls of puzzlement and
bewilderment and some anger and frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   But Valenti told ``The Hollywood Reporter'' he believes that
Lieberman's views are not politically motivated, but reflect a
genuine concern about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   None of this appears to trouble at least one studio _ DreamWorks
SKG _ owned by Spielberg, David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg issued a statement saying that Lieberman is a
``tough, honest, independent man of the highest integrity, who is
ultimately fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in Hollywood were hoping that Lieberman would make an
outreach gesture and perhaps attend one of the back-lot parties.
``You know, just to show he was down with the cause,'' says Wesley
Parks, a 35-year-old production assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, though, that would be like a scene from a really bad
movie. Or it could be par for the course in LA.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ Inside the ritzy ballroom of the Regent
Beverly Wilshire, across the street from the boutiques of Rodeo
Drive, Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California is working the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The event is a fund-raiser for EMILY's List, an organization
that supports female Democratic candidates who favor abortion
rights, and the crowd is mostly well-heeled women who have paid
$250 a plate for the luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi spots women she knows and tenderly squeezes their arms.
``Helloooo!'' she says, flashing a wide smile to each one. ``So
good to see you.''
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of politics and raising money, the seven-term
congresswoman from San Francisco is a master in the art of the
political schmooze. As a Democratic activist and money-raiser for
more than 30 years, she has built a formidable network of political
donors.
</P>
<P>
   This year's elections could be payback time for Pelosi, 60. If
Democrats win a majority in the House of Representatives, the
lawmaker hopes to become majority whip, the third-ranking position
in House leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi does not say she has a lock on the job, which in any case
hinges on her party regaining control of the House. But she said a
majority of House Democrats have committed to supporting her bid
for the post.
</P>
<P>
   At the Democratic National Convention this week, party leaders
are relishing the possibility. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., drew a
roar at the EMILY's List event when she said: ``Wouldn't it be
incredible to finally have a woman in the leadership of the House
of Representatives?''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi is not unchallenged in her quest: Rep. Steny H. Hoyer of
Maryland is vying for the whip's position. He, too, has campaigned
for other Democrats and he has said he is confident of winning.
</P>
<P>
   If the Democrats win a majority in the House for the first time
since 1994, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, now the minority
leader, would become speaker. David E. Bonior of Michigan, now the
minority whip, would become majority leader. That leaves an opening
in the No. 3 job _ the person who counts votes and works to rally
party members to support the leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Any candidate would need a majority of votes from the Democratic
Caucus, which now has 210 members. There are 223 Republicans and
two independents in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are raising money at a record pace for the fall
campaign. Pelosi estimates she has raised close to $3 million
already for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and in
direct contributions to party candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi acknowledges her fund-raising prowess is a large part of
why she is in the running for the whip job.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be able to win and retain a majority,'' she said
Tuesday. ``You have to be able to pay the bills. If you can't pay
the bills, why would you say, `I should be a leader?'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi grew up around politics, the daughter of Thomas
D'Alesandro Jr., who represented Baltimore for five terms in
Congress before he became mayor of the city for three terms. Her
brother, Thomas D'Alesandro III, also served a term as Baltimore
mayor. But Pelosi says she never saw herself in public office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought in terms of being always involved _ a supporter, a
volunteer, a contributor _ but I didn't think in terms of
running,'' she said. While she raised five children, Pelosi rose
through the ranks of party politics in California, becoming
Northern California chairwoman and then state chairwoman of the
California Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   When Rep. Sala Burton became ill shortly after being sworn into
office in January 1987, Burton asked Pelosi to run to succeed her.
When Burton died several weeks later, Pelosi ran and won a special
election in June 1987.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, Pelosi is best known for her vocal criticism of
China's human rights record and her push for more federal money for
AIDS research and treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know politics,'' Pelosi said. ``It's about understanding the
impact on a member of a certain vote, and understanding what it
takes for that person to win in their district. And that's in my
blood.''

 &HT;    Movies! LEGOS! Harry Potter meets the big money machine
 &HT;    By Emily Minor
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - His name is Harry Potter and he's
magical and mystical and he has beckoned kids to books like few
before his time. He eats frog-flavored candy and plays football in
the air. He's a kind underdog with a tainted past. But the
simplicity of all that's about to change, because Harry's jumping
off the pages and onto our movie screens, our video screens, right
into our kids' fast-food meal bags.
</P>
<P>
   It's starting, the commercialization of Harry Potter. It isn't
omnipresent quite yet. Time Inc.'s Warner Bros. unit, which has the
rights for the movie and the paraphernalia, is starting out slowly.
T-shirts, backpacks, pens, book covers. ``We can't keep the stuff
in the store,'' says the clerk at the Warner Bros. store in Palm
Beach Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   But it won't be too long before the movie is out (November 2001)
and the T-shirts are everywhere and the magic of Harry has turned
into materialistic madness. Gone are the days when the child with
$4 and the child with $400 could absorb the exact same magic from
Harry's funny, fabulous life.
</P>
<P>
   The LEGO company has bought the rights for Harry Potter LEGOS.
Soon we'll all be stepping on little plastic Harrys and Rons and
Hermiones in the dark of the night. A California company has bought
the rights to the video games. Electronic Arts said it plans to
publish games based on all four Harry Potter books, the upcoming
movie and all subsequent movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``EA has accepted the challenge to create a series of
interactive games that reflect the incredible imagination of J.K.
Rowling's books,'' says Don Mattrick, president of EA worldwide
studios. ``We are extremely excited to become part of the Harry
Potter phenomenon by bringing our own brand of interactive magic to
this fantastic series.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, what he's really saying is, ``Honey, order that
Lexus. We're rich.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the world, the Potter books have done something many
teachers haven't been able to do for years. They've turned kids
into bookworms. I've watched my kid read book one, then two, then
three and four. Then I watched him do it all over again. And now
I'll watch, with heavy heart, as he stands 2 inches from the
television screen, maneuvering through a video-game inventor's idea
of Hogwarts. He'll clutch the plastic video controls with the same
hands that once held the hard-covered books.
</P>
<P>
   I hold no grudges against J.K. Rowling, the 34-year-old former
welfare mother who's richer than rich because of her books. She's
marvelous. She deserves all this fortune. The books are amazing.
</P>
<P>
   But gone are the nights when children snuggled under the covers,
the bedspread pulled up around their heads, to explore the silent
magic of Harry's world. Gone are the nights when his next crazy
adventure kept the pages flipping long after light's out. Harry
Potter was so wonderful when he was just words on a page. Now it's
come down to what it always comes down to. Money from our wallets.

&HT;     JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAYS IT WAS UNFAIRLY CRITICIZED IN NEWSPAPER
DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Stung by a federal judge's attack on the
government's investigation of the sales of the San Francisco
Chronicle and the San Francisco Examiner, the Justice Department's
antitrust chief wants all critical references edited out of the
court decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely no political considerations, nor any factors beyond
enforcing the law, influenced any aspect of the department's
work,'' Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein said in a letter to
U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker.
</P>
<P>
   In a terse reply, Walker refused to change his ruling but said
the Justice Department was welcome to make a formal request to
reopen the case or have him reconsider his findings _ alternatives
that could subject the department to questioning about its motives
in the case. Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   The department letter, dated last Thursday, and Walker's answer,
dated Monday, were both made public Tuesday by the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Walker approved the Hearst Corp.'s $660 million purchase of the
Chronicle on July 27 and also found no basis to interfere with
Hearst's sale of The Examiner to local publisher Ted Fang, despite
his doubts about the legality of the $66 million subsidy Fang will
receive.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge's 46-page ruling denounced the role of the Justice
Department, which objected to Hearst's proposal to buy the
Chronicle and close The Examiner when no buyer could be found. The
department dropped its objection after the Fang transaction was
announced in March.
</P>
<P>
   Noting Fang's alliance with Mayor Willie Brown, who had
previously written to Attorney General Janet Reno opposing a
shutdown of The Examiner, Walker said he reached ``the uneasy
inference that the cronyism that fueled the Fang transaction at the
local level also exerted influence over the (Department of Justice)
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Flaws in the department's analysis may have been due to ``lack
of knowledge and inexperience in the newspaper industry,'' but also
could justify an inference that ``its action or inaction in this
case was political favoritism masquerading as law enforcement,''
Walker wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Klein, appointed by President Clinton as head of the Justice
Department's Antitrust Division, said in his letter last week that
Brown's letter to Reno last year was ``wholly unremarkable'' and
had no effect on the department's investigation. Klein said he knew
nothing about Brown's relationship with Fang until he read Walker's
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said the ``distinguished team of career department lawyers
and economists'' reviewing the case included two members with over
a decade of experience in newspaper cases and others with decades
of antitrust experience.
</P>
<P>
   He also spelled out, in greater detail than past communications,
the differences between the department's and Walker's views about
the effects of the newspaper sales on competition.
</P>
<P>
   Walker was particularly critical of the department's suggestion
to Hearst that any offer to sell The Examiner include the
newspaper's share of its joint operating agreement with the
Chronicle, which was scheduled to run through 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said the department wasn't suggesting that the agreement
had to be preserved at all costs, only that The Examiner's value to
a potential buyer should include a sum that represented its right
to divide profits with the Chronicle for the remainder of the JOA.
A buyer willing to pay more than that sum would likely try to
maintain a competitive newspaper after the JOA expired, Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nor did we require that Hearst divest assets to a particular
buyer,'' Klein wrote. ``Any suggestion that we supported favorable
treatment for ExIn (Fang's company), the eventual buyer of Examiner
assets, is unfounded.''
</P>
<P>
   He concluded by asking Walker to withdraw all portions of the
ruling that ``contain any statements about the Department of
Justice's motives or any suggestions of political influence on our
investigation and analysis of the Hearst matter.''
</P>
<P>
   In reply, Walker noted that the Justice Department had rejected
his two previous invitations to enter the case or provide a full
explanation of its views, instead sending brief letters that
outlined its actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it difficult to sympathize with your present concern
that the department's position was not adequately represented,''
the judge wrote. He also said he believed Klein had ``misread
portions of the decision.''

   &UR; BY JUDITH SHULEVITZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By giving Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, a religious Jew, a chance to
enthuse about his maker on a campaign rally platform, Al Gore took
a big step toward legitimizing the public display of religious
fervor. Suddenly, God isn't just for Christians anymore.
</P>
<P>
   But what about all the Americans who don't think anybody's God
has a place on the public square? Do all these frank confessions of
faith by candidates, whatever their denomination, threaten to blur
the line between church and state?
</P>
<P>
   The piety quotient in politics has been on the rise for quite
some time, since long before Lieberman appeared on the scene.
``[P]residential candidates in the current campaign have been
publicly invoking God and Jesus Christ at a pace not seen since the
days of William Jennings Bryan,'' wrote Wilfred M. McClay in an
essay, ``Two Concepts of Secularism,'' published early this summer
in the Wilson Quarterly.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman just quickens that pace. So is there cause for alarm?
Yes, in a standard we-must-be-ever-vigilant way: There's always
tension between religious passion and its constitutional
restraints. But also, provisionally, no. McClay's essay offers some
interesting new grounds for cautious optimism.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to determine whether secularism is, in fact, losing
ground to religion in American life, McClay concludes that there
are actually two kinds of secularism at work, what he calls
positive secularism and negative secularism. (He borrows the terms,
and his title, from philosopher Isaiah Berlin's celebrated 1958
essay ``Two Concepts of Liberty,'' which outlines a theory of
positive and negative liberty.)
</P>
<P>
   Positive secularism is a vigorous belief in the irrelevance and
even wrongheadedness of religion; it is often underpinned by a
rationalist worldview and the conviction that science has
superseded God.
</P>
<P>
   Negative secularism, on the other hand, is defined, of course,
negatively, by its opposition to the institutionalization of any
one religion (including positive secularism) in the public domain.
</P>
<P>
   As you probably guessed, McClay is for negative secularism _
which he identifies with the First Amendment's anti-establishment
clause _ and against positive secularism, which he rejects as
coercive, a form of active discrimination against religious
behavior, an effort to shut it behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   Positive secularists, he says, are monist: They insist on there
being only one true way. Negative secularists are pluralist,
inclusive, all-embracing. Positive secularism is in decline, and,
according to McClay, deservedly so. But is negative secularism
really rising up to take its place?
</P>
<P>
   That question McClay doesn't answer. He merely says that the
answer should be yes, and leaves it at that. Maybe so, but McClay
might underestimate the dangers posed by the religious majority to
religious minorities when faith becomes once again a significant
part of public life.
</P>
<P>
   After all, evangelical Christianity (to which 25 percent of the
American population adheres) is as ``positive'' in its desire to
convert others as positive secularism has ever been. (This may not
be a coincidence; Berlin, for one, sees modern rationalism as the
intellectual descendant of Protestantism, complete with its history
of zealotry.)
</P>
<P>
   But as much as we may be made nervous by Lieberman's (and
Bush's, and Gore's) overt religiosity, we can be equally cheered by
his warm embrace by Christian fundamentalists. This is a happy sign
that they accept the need for religious pluralism, however
tactically _ that is, as a way to make alliances in their larger
battle against the secularists.
</P>
<P>
   If McClay is right, religion as a public exercise is not about
to fade away. If we're lucky, such displays of inclusiveness by the
pious will turn out to be part of a trend _ one that began with the
Catholic John F. Kennedy, stretches to Lieberman, and will soon
reach beyond Judeo-Christianity to scarier, less familiar creeds. A
Muslim secretary of state, anyone?

CONFLICT
 &HT;    (1100&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    EDs: For purposes of a locator map, Yajalon is located about 90
miles north of San Cristobal de las Casas, in Chiapas state.
 &HT;    For Use Sun. Aug. 20 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   YAJALON, MEXICO _ Pigs snorted in mud and a chilly rain soaked
the mountains outside as Nicolas Lopez described how armed men
staged a terrifying raid on his hamlet earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Firing weapons into the air, the invaders claimed rights to the
villagers' land, setting fire to five huts, chasing about 30
families into hiding, and looting what little corn and clothes the
peasants had, Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as he shivered at the memory, Lopez managed a smile. On
Sunday(8/20) the Mayan Indian will vote in a historic election for
the new governor of Chiapas, one of Mexico's most impoverished and
volatile states. And if pre-election opinion polls are accurate,
Mexico's 71-year-old ruling party is headed for another defeat
after being trounced in July 2's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are waiting for a solution to our problems,'' said Lopez,
who will vote for Pablo Salazar, candidate of an opposition
alliance that could unseat Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary
Party, the PRI, from a state considered a barometer of social
justice in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Chiapas is home to the Zapatista Indian rebels, who launched an
insurrection against the Mexican government here in January 1994
that still hasn't been resolved. Since that time, armed
paramilitary groups loyal to the ruling party have also evolved,
periodically attacking Zapatista sympathizers like Lopez's hamlet.
</P>
<P>
   ``All government ties to these paramilitary groups will end (if
the PRI loses). One way to dismantle these groups is to simply not
guarantee them impunity any longer,'' said a sweat-soaked Salazar,
pausing for an interview and quick lunch during one of his final
grueling all-day campaign swings along Chiapas' sweltering tropical
coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are fed up and want change. And change is contagious,''
he said, waving at a marimba band in a restaurant that played a
song as a tribute to the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But Chiapas is considered a bulwark state for the PRI, and its
candidate, Sami David, has counted on a sympathetic state media
establishment that, as usual, offered slavishly favorable coverage
to him. A cordial man who is warm one-on-one, David also touched a
traditionally conservative nerve here with a campaign warning that
a Salazar victory could provoke even more instability.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Chiapas, an era of stability is at stake,'' David told a
recent gathering of PRI youth in the capital city of Tuxtla
Gutierrez.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the northern part of Chiapas is a checkerboard of Mayan
Indian villages divided between Zapatistas and PRI loyalists who
sporadically clash over land rights and political differences. The
collection of huts where Lopez lived _ nestled in rugged hills
above the city of Yajalon (pronounced, ``ya-ha-LONE'') _ was
eventually occupied by Mexican Army troops. But since the villagers
also fear the army, they refused to return.
</P>
<P>
   The election of Mexican President-elect Vicente Fox has sparked
hope for a peaceful resolution to the cycle of violence. Fox
ousted, for the first time in seven decades, the PRI, which the
Zapatistas blame for the squalid conditions the southern state's
Indians live in.
</P>
<P>
   Before the July 2 election, Subcommander Marcos, the primary
Zapatista spokesman, issued a statement reiterating the rebels'
position that they would negotiate again if a peace accord signed
in 1996 is implemented and federal troops are withdrawn from Indian
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is a promoter of free-market economic policies, which the
Zapatistas oppose, but he has pledged to revive negotiations with
the rebels and send Mexico's Congress the stalled 1996 accord that
grants sweeping Indian rights. If elected, Salazar could also set
an example that change can be forced at the ballot box rather than
at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one, not even the most radical person in the country can
dispute the legitimacy of a Fox government,'' Salazar said,
predicting that the Zapatistas can't dismiss electoral change.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent campaign stop in the gritty border town of Hidalgo
on the Guatemala border, supporters were enraptured with Salazar's
pledge to address the demands of the poor _ including the
Zapatistas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Zapatistas said our fight is against being forgotten. They
said there is a worse death than dying from diarrhea or from
curable diseases,'' the candidate shouted from the stage to wild
cheers. ``There is a worse death, say our Indian brothers, and that
is the death that comes from being forgotten. Well, you people are
about to do something about that painful reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Salazar is a federal senator and former member of the PRI, which
he says used to be the only option available to someone who wanted
to get into political office. But he left the party in May 1999
after a long string of disputes over the government's handling of
the Chiapas conflict.
</P>
<P>
   He is unaffiliated now, but is representing a four-party
alliance that includes Fox's conservative National Action Party, or
PAN, and the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, the PRD. The two
parties clash ideologically, but for the purpose of defeating the
PRI in Chiapas they pooled their funds and worked hand-in-hand for
Salazar.
</P>
<P>
   An exhausted-looking David said he isn't giving up, and he
dismisses polls like one conducted by Reforma newspapers, which
gave Salazar a 9-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Chiapas, the conditions to avoid confrontations or even
social collapse are being constructed with great difficulty,'' he
said an interview with Cox Newspapers. He had a badly bruised and
swollen ear, the result of an injury when someone threw a metal
weight at him in Salazar's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a platform for electoral reform,'' he insisted. ``The
offers for change have to be based on clarity and not on
deception.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI's presidential candidate, Francisco Labastida, won in
Chiapas last month. But Salazar is counting on the combined votes
of the PAN and the PRD to carry him to victory. His campaign
posters say, ``the PRI has already lost in Chiapas, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's victory could also inspire PRI desertion.
</P>
<P>
   Among some of Chiapas' poor peasant farmers, Fox is now seen as
Mexico's new ``tlatoani,'' the Aztec word for ``maximum leader,''
Salazar campaign aide Mauricio Gandara said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know that the 'Papa PRI' has died now. So they are
wondering who will be managing the money and resources. They are
thinking that now there is a 'Papa Fox,''' Gandara said. ``This is
the product of 71 years of domination by one party.''
</P>
<P>
   Araceli Burguete, a Chiapas sociologist, said the PRI still
controls many Indians in the state. It will probably be business as
usual in Indian towns where the local PRI leader habitually orders
residents how to vote, she said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But even in PRI strongholds, some residents appeared to be
bracing for change.
</P>
<P>
   Chenalho is an Indian town that produced at least one of the
convicted killers implicated in the infamous December 1997 massacre
of 45 people in the pro-Zapatista village of Acteal, just minutes
away.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Jimenez, 82, said he would listen to the advice of
village leaders, but wasn't sure who he'd vote for. He pulled
dismissively at a PRI T-shirt he was wearing and said almost
apologetically, ``This is five years old now.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Luis Ortiz, a resident who has joined the movement to
deploy thousands of election observers here, complained that the
PRI had donated a Ford truck to the town ``in exchange for votes.''
</P>
<P>
   In Acteal, the site of the massacre, affiliates of the Zapatista
Army said they didn't plan to vote and declined to speak further.
Rebel leaders have been silent, other than to say they won't call
for a general boycott of the election.
</P>
<P>
   Those in Acteal who sympathize with the rebels but don't belong
to the army will cast ballots for Salazar.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Salazar doesn't win, we will think there has been fraud,''
said Spanish-speaking spokesman Agustin Vasquez. ``Acteal is
willing to vote for Salazar. The victims of the massacre are
waiting for justice and for change.''

SUPERCHEF DEBORAH MADISON ENCOURAGING US TO RECONNECT WITH THE
LAND

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. _ Deborah Madison, her long fingers cupping an
imaginary bowl, is explaining the precepts of begging in Buddhism.
The student, it's now apparent, has become teacher.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a journey of discovery for this California girl, an
embodiment of one of the most lasting movements of her generation.
Founding chef of the nation's most important vegetarian restaurant
and author of seminal vegetarian cookbooks, Madison is a member of
the pantheon that also honors Alice Waters and Mollie Katzen.
</P>
<P>
   But on this clear August day in her New Mexico house, she
doesn't want to talk about vegetarianism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sick to death of vegetarianism,'' she says, tucking her
foot under her body on the denim-covered sofa. ``Vegetarianism is
fine, but I'm not a promoter. I've never been drawn to limits. I
think vegetarians can be very self-absorbed; it's just a little too
precious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of worrying about whether a cheese includes rennet or
not, we should be thinking about where that cheese came from, what
the land was like, how far it traveled.''
</P>
<P>
   This may sound like heresy to Madison's fans, baby boomers who
have followed her career through Greens restaurant in San Francisco
and her books such as ``Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Call her an accidental vegetarian.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, as a member of a Zen Buddhist study/living center
near Big Sur, Madison helped prepare the group's meals. Although
the tenets of Buddhism vary on the issue of consuming fish and
fowl, for the harmony of the center it was agreed that all the
meals would be vegetarian.
</P>
<P>
   With some encouragement from visitors who had enjoyed the food
at the center, it was agreed that a natural-foods restaurant in San
Francisco might be a good project. In 1979, Greens was born.
</P>
<P>
   Greens was an immediate success _ within three weeks of opening,
Madison, with only minimal restaurant experience, was feeding 300
people a day at lunch. No longer was natural food dark and drab and
heavy and mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very picky about what we served,'' Madison says. ``There
were no parsley and orange slice garnishes. We didn't serve sprouts
unless they were essential to the dish. I wanted the food to be
contemporary and bright and delicious.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, exhausted by her success, Madison left Greens
to be private chef for the director at the American Academy in
Rome. After a year, she returned to Berkeley to write the
``Greens'' cookbook because ``I had put 15 years of my life into
that food.''
</P>
<P>
   Madison's success with that book enabled her to have a writing
career and to press for her passion: re-establishing our
connections with the land. She is a fierce proponent of the Santa
Fe Farmers' Market, a 25-year-old twice-weekly market that
showcases the wares of as many as 100 northern New Mexico food
producers.
</P>
<P>
   And with her no-limits philosophy, Madison is inclusive with her
effusiveness over this booming enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the farmers are organic, some aren't. These farmers
are keeping local agriculture traditions alive _ and if we don't do
that, what will the land become? Another trailer park, a golf
course. We'll never get that land back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a local chicken farmer who has a fairly small
operation near Socorro. But he does have 10,000 chickens. You go to
his farm and you don't smell them, you don't hear them. Their huts
are moved twice a day so the land is more fertile and there's no
run-off of pollutants into the Rio Grande. He keeps the flocks
together as they grow, so there's no re-establishment of pecking
order every time they're separated, making for less stress for the
birds. These are important things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food is really grown in the garden; it is only finished in the
kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People tell me all the time that they don't have time to cook.
Well, how hard is it to slice a really good tomato? And how hard is
it to serve a wonderful, juicy peach? It's not. But when you have a
bad peach, what do you do? You make a crisp. So you have to have
cream and butter, and it gets very involved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A connection to our food is a very fundamental thing; we need
to have a relationship with our food and its source, and I
shouldn't even have to be saying that,'' Madison says.
</P>
<P>
   But she does, and most likely, like the California girl that she
is, she will keep on saying that.

PRESIDENT EMPHASIZES UNITY IN ADDRESS TO LEGISLATURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ With puns, jokes and a touch of naughty
wordplay, President Abdurrahman Wahid lifted the mood of
Indonesia's bitterly feuding legislature Wednesday, soothing its
members with the fundamental message of his presidency: debate and
disagreement are acceptable, even healthy.
</P>
<P>
   In an extemporaneous address that epitomized the sea change he
has brought to politics and leadership in Indonesia, Wahid drew
repeated laughter, sometimes chuckling himself as he spoke.
</P>
<P>
   The 700 legislators, who had greeted him mostly with hostility
throughout the bulk of a two-week special session, frequently
interrupted him with applause.
</P>
<P>
   Divided among themselves, against the president and along
religious and political lines, the lawmakers applauded when Wahid
stated his credo of ``tolerance, diversity and the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia continues to struggle with widespread violence,
economic stagnation and political infighting ten months into
Wahid's presidency. Though he is disorganized and politically weak,
Wahid has offered at least a democratic compass as Indonesia seeks
to reorient itself after three decades of dictatorship under former
President Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's message of the free exchange of ideas has not yet taken
root in a society where public differences can be seen as taboo and
disagreement can be taken as enmity.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Wahid was once again the Muslim teacher of his
roots, using humor, parables and indirection to make his points.
And he reminded the assembly, meeting on Indonesia's 55th National
Day, of the nation's credo: unity in diversity.
</P>
<P>
   The change he offers is a shift in emphasis. Where Suharto
employed the strong arm of the military and enforced unquestioning
unity, Wahid celebrates diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to defuse tensions, he joked about the multiplicity of
languages, ethnicities and religions in this sprawling archipelago
and its 210 million people.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Wahid startled the legislature into laughter by
making a pun on a political acronym and producing the words
``hanging out your underwear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So here's an example of how we are different but we use
tradition in our daily lives to accommodate our differences,'' he
said over the laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Then, using a characteristic turn of phrase, he said: ``We
shouldn't make a big deal out of it. It's normal. I hope we can be
mature enough to discuss any kind of problem that we have, because
each of us has his own ideas. This kind of openness will preserve
the treasure of our diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The same diversity was welcome in the legislature itself, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very impressed with this assembly,'' he said. ``We
have had an open debate, and this showed that we have a warm
brotherhood and people can speak their minds. We don't have to be
worried or suspicious because there is no regime to haunt us.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Making an example of one of the most contentious issues of the
moment, he said he welcomed opposition to his proposal to lift a
ban on communism, a move he has described as part of his philosophy
of inclusiveness. But he said he, too, had the right to his
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a good dialogue in the right place,'' he said, ``and in
full view of the public so that the public can contribute its own
ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It's nothing to be ashamed of if we express
different opinions. It's something we should be proud of because it
is the realization of our credo, unity in diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's remarks lasted only a few minutes. He was followed at
the podium by Vice President Megawati Sukarnoputri who read his
formal speech, calling for national reconciliation, promising
economic revival and saying Indonesia should learn from its
mistakes and move forward.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid is virtually blind, and all his speeches to the assembly
have been read for him by an aide. Megawati's agreement to read his
speech Wednesday, and her public contribution to its drafting,
signaled a rapprochement in the political standoff that has been an
undercurrent of the session.
</P>
<P>
   Facing concerted challenges to his authority, Wahid has shown
that he not only has a broad vision for Indonesia but that he is
also its most agile political infighter.
</P>
<P>
   As the assembly approaches its conclusion this week, its
politics have come full circle, with the power alignment at the top
much as it was before, despite Wahid's promise to give his vice
president more administrative duties.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and political analysts said its main accomplishment
may have been to begin clarifying the political playing field and
the balance between executive and legislative power in post-Suharto
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of impeachment has disappeared. The president has been
given a second chance. In the coming days, he is expected to name a
new Cabinet and a new economic team in what amounts to a fresh try
at making his government more focused and productive.

</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ We're going to miss him. Even the people who can't
wait to get rid of him are going to miss him.
</P>
<P>
   What we're all going to miss, about a month into the Gore or the
Bush administration, is Clinton's sheer skill at being president.
This has nothing to do with his policies, his views, or his sexual
morality. It's simply a matter of Clinton's astonishing virtuosity
as a public performer.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is so good in the public role of the presidency that you
almost don't notice it anymore. Clinton makes a verbal false step
or misjudges the appropriate tone for an occasion once every couple
of years. George W. Bush makes a verbal slip about once every
half-hour. Al Gore strikes a false note in three appearances out of
four.
</P>
<P>
   I was reminded of this watching Clinton speak at a pro-Israel
rally here the other day. Clinton went off on a riff about the
Oklahoma City bombing. I don't have his exact words, but Clinton
described Timothy McVeigh as a poor, sick kid who listened to too
many anti-government tirades from conservatives. There were no
audible gasps from the audience, but this was a fairly shocking
thing to say.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was essentially blaming the Republicans for creating a
climate that led to mass murder. But he did it in such an offhand,
jez-talkin' way that it didn't sound vicious at all.
</P>
<P>
   Gore could never get away with a remark like that. If he had
uttered exactly the same words Clinton used, it would have sounded
brutally partisan, nasty and unfair. It would have generated
headlines: GORE CALLS REPUBLICANS KILLERS. But it's unfair to
compare Gore's communication skills to Clinton's because Clinton's
are without peer.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech Monday evening was uninspired as a piece of
text. As usual, he attempted little in the way of soaring rhetoric
or memorable lines (Clinton may leave office after eight years
without having delivered a single truly memorable line). His coda,
which reprised all the most excruciating Clintonite cliches, (The
Man From Hope, Putting People First, Building a Bridge to the 21st
Century, Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow) was tacky. Yet Clinton
gave a superb speech nonetheless. He always does.
</P>
<P>
   You could say it was his delivery, but that term fails to do
justice to the way Clinton relates and communicates. Clinton
engages himself in giving a speech the way a great musician engages
a piece of music. He doesn't just deliver it; he embodies it,
expressing himself through his phrasing, his vast repertoire of
gestures, his entire body.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the speech was simple. Clinton set out to do three
things: note the accomplishments of the past eight years, draw a
contrast with Republican policies, and praise Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   On the accomplishments, Clinton tossed out a plethora of facts,
figures and specific programs: the lowest unemployment rate in 30
years, the lowest crime rate in 25, the lowest child poverty rate
in 20, welfare rolls cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   ``America's success was not a matter of chance,'' Clinton said.
``It was a matter of choice.''
</P>
<P>
   In the section contrasting Democratic policies with those of the
Republicans, Clinton went after the GOP not with the sledgehammer
of contempt but with the scalpel of irony. He reminded his audience
that Republicans warned that his 1993 economic plan would lead to a
recession and ruin the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans said then they would not be held responsible
for the results of our economic policies,'' Clinton said. ``I hope
the American people will take them at their word.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing his efforts to create a Cabinet that looks like America,
he added, ``If I could get my whole administration up here it would
be as good a picture as anything you saw in Philadelphia a couple
of weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The praise of Gore seemed to me the weakest section of the
speech. Basically, Clinton vouched for Gore and Joseph Lieberman,
saying they would work to continue the successes his administration
has had. ``Al Gore is a profoundly good man,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   I don't disagree. But Gore is not a gifted man. And taking the
stage Clinton occupied Monday night will make that all too readily
apparent.

ELITIST PREP SCHOOL IN D.C. IS GORE'S LITTLE SECRET

</P>
<P>
   Delegates to the Democratic convention will be harangued with
endless hay-strewn yarns about Al Gore's rustic Tennessee
childhood, but they will not hear one word about the place where
Gore spent most of his formative years: St. Albans School.
</P>
<P>
   Gore captained the Bulldogs football team, led the Government
Club, and graduated 25th out of 51 students in the class of 1965.
</P>
<P>
   The veep's in good company. The Washington, D.C. prep school has
become the spawning ground for the Democratic Party. Sen. Evan Bayh
of Indiana, who was short-listed for Gore's running mate, is a St.
Albans alumnus. Fellow short-listee Sen. John Kerry of
Massachusetts attended St. Albans for several years. Rep. Harold
Ford Jr., the convention's keynote speaker and the youngest member
of Congress, was in my class at St. Albans.
</P>
<P>
   We were several years behind Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., another
rising young black congressman.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore daughter and adviser Karenna Gore Schiff prepped at the
National Cathedral School, St. Albans' sister institution.
</P>
<P>
   St. Albans embarrasses Gore and his party. Gore never mentions
that he went there. All the St. Albans pols skip the school in
their official biographies. When he was being considered for
running mate, Kerry went so far as calling a reporter (still
another Albanian, Brit Hume) to emphasize that he had left St.
Albans and graduated from a different high school.
</P>
<P>
   The bashfulness is understandable. St. Albans is a snooty,
elitist, inside-the-Beltway institution. The people's party fears
association with an all-boys private school that costs nearly
$20,000 a year, has a ``refectory'' instead of a ``cafeteria,'' and
prides itself on its noblesse oblige. (Gore is, however, inoculated
from St. Albans attacks by the Bush campaign: George W. Bush's
younger brothers Neil and Marvin are graduates.)
</P>
<P>
   How did St. Albans, which is not even one of the nation's most
celebrated private schools, assume such a central role in American
politics?
</P>
<P>
   Prep schools, of course, occupy a hallowed, if horrible, place
in the story of the American establishment. As Nicholas Lemann
chronicles in ``The Big Test: The Secret History of the American
Meritocracy,'' the boarding schools of New England molded the
American Protestant aristocracy from the late-19th century to the
mid-20th century.
</P>
<P>
   The schools enforced muscular Christianity: The football field
was more important than the classroom, and character was,to quote a
favorite St. Albans phrase,''choosing the hard right over the easy
wrong.'' The schools were intended to ``prevent very rich boys from
turning into playboys or pantywaists,'' Lemann writes.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1909, St. Albans served as the D.C. outpost of the
New England prep schools. Under a series of imposing headmasters,
the Episcopal cathedral school earned a reputation for academic and
athletic rigor. The D.C. elite gravitated to it. It was respectable
and Protestant, it won students admission to top colleges, and its
politics were liberal enough not to chagrin Democratic parents: St.
Albans integrated in 1954, early for D.C. private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Even after standardized tests broke the prep schools' chokehold
on the establishment in the '60s, St. Albans remained a bastion of
the D.C. aristocracy. Vice Presidents Dan Quayle, Walter Mondale,
and Al Gore deposited their sons at the Lane-Johnston building. So
did dozens of senators, including Ted Kennedy and John D.
Rockefeller IV, as well as the Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. and Jordan's
King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The most important reason St. Albans mints politicians is
genetic. The best indicator of a boy's career is his father's. St.
Albans enrolls lots of political sons because of its location and
reputation, and they frequently follow Dad into politics. Most of
the St. Albans grads turned pols _ Gore, Bayh, Ford, and Jackson _
are the oldest sons of politicians. They probably would have run
for office if they had attended PS 152.
</P>
<P>
   But biology is not destiny. St. Albans also steers its boys into
politics. The school acclimates students to Washington. It offers
courses on political theory, American government, American
citizenship, and macroeconomics. Pols are regularly carted in to
speak at assemblies and graduations.
</P>
<P>
   The most prestigious extracurricular activity is the Government
Club, a Thursday night political debate between the ``Liberal'' and
``Conservative'' parties. (Both Gore and Ford served as Liberal
presidents.)
</P>
<P>
   St. Albans still clings to the (now-unfashionable) idea of
noblesse oblige. When boarding schools began losing their
influence, most of them shucked their haute-WASP traditions and
modernized with a vengeance. They adopted coeducation,
multiculturalized their curricula, abandoned dress codes, and
generally distanced themselves from the civic-minded condescension
that had defined them.
</P>
<P>
   But St. Albans hardly wavered from its traditionalism. It is
much more like old boarding schools such as Groton than Groton
itself is. Chapel is still a twice-weekly requirement. The dress
code is rigid. Coeducation is unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Other schools de-emphasized sports, but St. Albans recently
upped its athletic requirement and added such high-suffering,
high-teamwork sports as crew and hockey.
</P>
<P>
   The school unashamedly exhorts service as an obligation of
privilege. At every chapel and ceremony, the headmaster drummed
into our swelled heads our duty to help those poor, benighted souls
not fortunate enough to be Albanians. (Students are sardonic about
this, but they don't resist. A recent anti-Gore editorial in the
St. Albans student newspaper commented dryly: ``St. Albans for good
reasons encourages self-confidence [we are going to run the country
in a few years, right?]'')
</P>
<P>
   St. Albans imparts its high Episcopal arrogance to a different
kind of boy from the WASPs of yore. Of the St. Albans pols, only
Sen. John Warner and Bayh are actually Episcopalians. Kerry is
Roman Catholic. Gore, Ford, and Jackson are Baptists; and Ford and
Jackson are black.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Albans indoctrination creates a very distinctive kind of
politician. St. Albans helps explains why Gore, Bayh, Ford and
Jackson are so unlike their fathers. Their fathers shook up
politics. Gore Sr. was a civil rights maverick. Ford Sr. was one of
the first black politicians of the Deep South. Jackson Sr. is a
champion rabble-rouser.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians, by contrast, are superb at fitting in. St. Albans
is a tiny school _ only 70-odd boys per class. It is too small for
cliques. Its size and traditionalism compel conformity. Students
adopt the St. Albans style_ athletic, sarcastic, hardworkingor they
drown. Nonconformists detest the school and usually leave or
suffer. (Gore's mother once called him ``a born conformist.'')
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians lack the overt, grasping ambition that defines
many politicians, including most of their dads. Thanks to the
school's Service First ethos, they consider themselves ``selfless
public servants,'' says Lemann. The St. Albans pols are allergic to
their fathers' populism: After all, they have not spent much time
with the people. Except for Ford, they are not natural
glad-handers.
</P>
<P>
   Their fathers were vigorously liberal. The sons are not
ideological. (Ford and Jackson are probably the least ideological
black politicians in the United States.) St. Albans trained them to
trust cool analysis and the reasonable solution.
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise to anyone who went to St. Albans that Gore,
Ford, Bayh and Jackson are relentlessly moderate. The school's old
money, old manners and old traditions breed excellent New
Democrats.

   1. WHY WE'LL ALL MISS BILL CLINTON by Jacob Weisberg
</P>
<P>
   What we're all going to miss, about a month into the Gore or the
Bush administration, is Clinton's sheer skill at being president.
This has nothing to do with his policies, his views, or his sexual
morality. It's simply a matter of Clinton's astonishing virtuosity
as a public performer.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is so good in the public role of the presidency that you
almost don't notice it anymore. Clinton makes a verbal false step
or misjudges the appropriate tone for an occasion once every couple
of years. George W. Bush makes a verbal slip about once every
half-hour. Al Gore strikes a false note in three appearances out of
four.

</P>
<P>
   By giving Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, a religious Jew, a chance to
enthuse about his maker on a campaign rally platform, Al Gore took
a big step toward legitimizing the public display of religious
fervor. Suddenly, God isn't just for Christians anymore.
</P>
<P>
   But what about all the Americans who don't think anybody's God
has a place on the public square? Do all these frank confessions of
faith by candidates, whatever their denomination, threaten to blur
the line between church and state?

childhood, but they will not hear one word about the place where
Gore spent most of his formative years: St. Albans School.
</P>
<P>
   The veep's in good company. The Washington, D.C. prep school has
become the spawning ground for the Democratic Party. Sen. Evan Bayh
of Indiana, who was short-listed for Gore's running mate, is a St.
Albans alumnus. Fellow short-listee Sen. John Kerry of
Massachusetts attended St. Albans for several years. Rep. Harold
Ford Jr., the convention's keynote speaker and the youngest member

<P>
   Now that its convention is over, will the Republican Party keep
pretending that it likes black people? As the Philadelphia story
would have it, attracting black voters simply means returning to a
proud history from which the GOP has only recently deviated.

<P>
   In truth, the history of the Republican Party's relationship
with blacks is one of a bright start followed by a gradual but
steady decline.

 &HT;    STATUS OF CONCORDES IN LIMBO FOLLOWING FRENCH, BRITISH GROUNDING
 &HT;    (800&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It could be months before the supersonic Concorde flies
again following Wednesday's official grounding by aviation
authorities, alarmed that a tire failure led to last month's fiery
crash near Paris that killed 113 people.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft's designers have begun the complex process of
developing a modification to the 30-year-old aircraft that will
assure regulators that there will be no repeat of the Air France
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have determined that the accident was caused by a
chain of events set off by the rupture of one or more of the
Concorde's tires, a relatively routine event for passenger planes,
air safety officials said. The Concorde crashed less than two
minutes after the tire burst, which sent debris rifling through its
wings and rupturing fuel tank.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Malcolm Field, chairman of the British Civil Aviation
Authority, told reporters at a news conference that the burst tire
was the primary cause of the crash. ``What is uniquely different in
this case is that tire debris alone is thought to have led to this
catastrophic accident,'' Field said.
</P>
<P>
   Field said that a single tire failure should never be enough to
bring down a passenger aircraft, adding that it was only by ``the
grace of God'' that there had not been another Concorde crash.
</P>
<P>
   France' General Direction for Civil Aviation also decided
Wednesday to suspend the Concorde's certification, the Transport
Ministry said. The move was largely academic, because all Air
France Concordes have been grounded in the three weeks since the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   The BEA recommended that the certificated be suspended until
``appropriate measures guaranteeing a satisfactory level of
security as far as the risks linked to the destruction of the
tires'' can be implemented.
</P>
<P>
   ``The BEA has determined that it was the destruction of a tire _
a simple event which one cannot be sure will not happen again _
that caused various damages to the structure and systems of the
plane, leading to the crash less than one minute and 30 seconds
after the destruction of the tire,'' the agency said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation officials said Concorde's manufacturers will have to
develop a way to end the risk that a burst tire will have the
potential of causing a crash, which is a requirement for a
passenger aircraft to be issued an airworthiness certificate.
</P>
<P>
   The companies that built the Concorde in the 1970s are now part
of European Aeronautic Defense &AMP; Space Co. and Britain's BAE
Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Once a solution is designed, it will then be a financial matter
for British Airways and Air France, the only airlines to operate
the Concorde. Even before the crash, both airlines said the sleek
supersonic aircraft would be retired in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, British Airways said it would meet with
manufacturers and air safety officials to develop measures to get
its flagship aircraft flying again. The airline said its seven
Concordes would be kept ready to resume service with 24 hours
notice.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Street, the airlines' director of customer services and
operations, pledged that British Airways would keep safety
paramount. ``We will only resume Concorde operations when we and
the airworthiness authorities are completely satisfied that all
necessary safety measures have been taken in the light of all the
latest information,'' Street said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bell, another official with the British Civil Aviation
Authority, said he expected it would be ``months rather than
weeks'' before the Concorde flies again. British Airways, which
resumed flying its Concordes the day after the July 25 crash in
Gonesse, France, cancelled its flights until September. Air France
has not flown its remaining five aircraft since the crash, and has
given no indication when it expects to resume its supersonic
operations.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways said it may use the down time to carry out a $22
million re-fit of its Concorde cabins, a project originally
scheduled for early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Paul-Louis Arslanian, the head of France's Air Accident
Investigation Bureau, told reporters in Paris that he hoped the
supersonic aircraft would return to the skies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Concorde is an extraordinary symbol. A symbol of progress,''
Arslanian said at a news conference. ``I hope the Concorde will fly
again, but I am an investigator of accidents, not a witch doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   While investigators said last week the crash stemmed from a tire
blow-out caused by a 16-inch metal strip on the runway, experts
said Wednesday that a chunk of rubber from the tire _ not metal
from the undercarriage _ probably punctured at least one fuel tank.
</P>
<P>
   British officials said Concordes had suffered 70 previous tire
blowouts since entering service in 1976, seven of them rupturing
fuel tanks in the wings.
</P>
<P>
   But in each of these cases, the tire explosion had knocked off a
piece of metal that had pierced the wing. Consequently, regulators
have focused on reinforcing metal parts instead of the rubber
tires.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Devising modifications to prevent a similar catastrophe will be
a huge and potentially expensive technical challenge, aviation
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Kieran Daly, the editor of the aviation website Air Transport
Intelligence, said the airlines and manufacturers would have to
consider strengthening the tires, which are made by Goodyear Tire &AMP;
Rubber Co. and Dunlop Tire Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other possible solution is strengthening the structure
around the fuel tank but that would have a very serious weight
penalty,'' Daly said. ``It would also take a considerable time to
devise that fix and get it on the aircraft _ months or more. The
most practical idea may be devising some sort of casing around the
tires _ a shield.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane's Aviation security editor Chris Yates said such a shield
might have to be made of titanium for the metal's strength and
lightness. However, Yates said this solution may not be financially
feasible for an aircraft that has a maximum of 15 years left to
operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``One has to question whether the cost of doing that would
outweigh the benefit,'' he said.

<P>
   A couple of readers have recently written looking for simple
Chinese recipes. Chinese food is scary for some of us; the
ingredients seem odd and the wok and other equipment can be
intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   In such cases, I recommend books published by, for example,
Better Homes &AMP; Gardens, Sunset and HP. Geared to American kitchens,
these books take a realistic, hands-on approach without sending the
Asian cuisine novice to the far reaches of groceryland for
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Try these recipes before moving on to books by Martin Yan and
Ken Hom.
</P>

   Our first letter-writer would like a recipe for fried rice.
Chinese cooking does not require a wok, although using one makes
you look as if you really know what you're doing in the kitchen. A
well-seasoned cast-iron skillet will work just as well; you'll
simply need to stir often. (The wok was invented to have sloping
sides with no hard-to-reach corners where food can stick at high
heat.)
</P>
<P>
   This week, we're running three variations of fried rice. Next
week it's on to wonton soup, pepper steak, and shrimp in lobster
sauce.

<P>
   A couple of readers have recently written looking for simple
Chinese recipes. Chinese food is scary for some of us; the
ingredients seem odd and the wok and other equipment can be
intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   In such cases, I recommend books published by, for example,
Better Homes &AMP; Gardens, Sunset and HP. Geared to American kitchens,
these books take a realistic, hands-on approach without sending the
Asian cuisine novice to the far reaches of groceryland for
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Try these recipes before moving on to books by Martin Yan and
Ken Hom.

 &HT;    Widow of Thresher officer recalls the fear and the loss
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - If there is such a thing as a primal
fear, a terror universal to mankind, this is it: to be trapped
alive, wrapped in a deadly embrace of the sea and cold steel,
perhaps to be entombed, at depths beyond escape, like the Russian
submariners in their boat at the bottom of the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   People worldwide may hope, pray, wish for a successful rescue.
All can share in the hope, as well as imagine fear.
</P>
<P>
   But few, very few, can muster for the Russian sailors and their
families the empathy Joyce Smarz of Palm Beach Gardens possesses.
Her husband, Lt. John Smarz Jr., was lost with 128 crew mates when
the USS Thresher went down, April 10, 1963. Joyce Smarz knows more
than the fears. She knows the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``John said submarines were the safest place to be on the
planet,'' she says. ``He loved the boats. He was one of the rare
enlisted men to come up through the ranks and become an officer. He
served on the first nuclear submarine, the Nautilus. And he served
on the Thresher. And he died on the Thresher.''
</P>
<P>
   John Smarz was right. Mile for mile, man for man, subs are safe
_ safer than airplanes and cars and trains. Only two American subs
have gone down since World War II _ the Thresher in 1963, and the
Scorpion in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Russian subs have not fared as well _ more than 20 Russian and
Soviet subs were heavily damaged and at least four sank during the
Cold War and the years following. One was seriously damaged in 1993
after colliding with a U.S. nuclear sub in the Barents Sea, an
incident that underscores a fact submariners know but Hollywood
can't abide: Even crammed full of modern sonar and radar, subs are
hard to find, almost impossible to ``see.''
</P>
<P>
   John Smarz was right. But aboard the Thresher, on that cold
spring day in 1963, everything that could go wrong did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had just moved to New London (Conn.),'' says Joyce Smarz.
``Thresher was out of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on a test cruise.
But it was going to be based in New London. It was two weeks to the
day since we moved into the house. Navy housing. The Navy gave John
a short leave to come home for a couple of days because our son was
sick. Then he went back to Portsmouth, to the Thresher. That was on
Sunday, I think.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three days later, on the 10th, a couple of Thresher wives
stopped over to the house. They were just moving in, too. We were
talking, about what I cannot remember. Kids and husbands, I
suppose. It was late afternoon. We heard a bulletin on TV. A U.S.
sub was lost. We knew. We knew it had to be Thresher. I shut the TV
off. That's exactly what I did when I heard a bulletin about the
Russian ship. I shut the TV off. It's too hard to listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I can feel for the Russian wives, the mothers, sisters. I
know what they are going through. But you know, it's the guys on
the boat I'm thinking of most. The guys.''
</P>
<P>
   She is sitting on a couch in her townhouse. She is 66, more than
half a lifetime removed from her husband, the Navy, the Thresher.
Many books on prayer and praying sit on side tables, along with
some porcelain knickknacks and a leather-bound Thresher memorial
book. She is not conducting an interview surrounded by letters from
John, Navy commendations, piles of photos of family and shipmates
and friends, by the usual remembrances of times past that are
pulled from boxes by military widows for inquisitive visitors. All
such connections and reminders were lost by the movers when she
left New London after Thresher went down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know what I got from the Navy, just two weeks after the
sub was lost? A notice to move out of the apartment within three
months. I guess when you're out of the Navy, you're out of the
Navy. Years later, when the boys were ready for college, I wrote
off to the Navy and asked about the Thresher fund. It was started
by friends and families. Much money had been collected, from
cities, towns, from all over the country, the world. A lot of
money. I was told the Thresher fund had been `merged' with another
fund, a scholarship fund. Who knows where the Thresher fund ended
up. It was as lost as the sub.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Smarz never wanted to know exactly what had happened on
board Thresher. One of her sons, Jimmy, who was 5 when the boat
went down, became a virtual expert on the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows for sure, but the usual explanation goes something
like this: For some reason, the nuclear reactor was shut down
during a deep dive test. Normally, without nuclear power, the boat
could be brought to the surface by battery power and by blowing the
ballast tanks free of water. But when air was released into the
ballast tanks, the air valves froze closed. The batteries couldn't
bring the sub up with flooded tanks. Thresher was doomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy wanted to know what happened. I didn't,'' she says. ``I
knew it was quick. At least I heard it was quick. I suppose that's
a comfort. I heard it was a man-made problem. I suppose that
bothered me, because I remember that expression _ man-made. John
didn't die in war, which would be different. But he was gone. And
he was going to stay gone. So what's the point of knowing exactly
how?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian boat, though. It's not quick, is it? It's
terrible. You'd think they could get the men off. You hope. You
pray.''

<P>
   When you're in the voting booth this November, you should
consider whether your candidate is stubborn or ambitious since
those traits are the mark of a great president, new research shows.
</P>
<P>
   You might also want to look at other character issues before you
pull the lever. Great presidents are more extroverted, assertive,
thrill-seeking and open to fantasy, the research suggests.
</P>
<P>
   As a final check, don't expect a great president to have a neat
desk or be very straightforward, researchers conducting the The
Personality and Presidency Project say. Historically, great
presidents rank low on being neat, being vulnerable or being up
front with the facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at how our 41 presidents compared to average
Americans,'' says Steven Rubenzer, a psychologist with the Mental
Health &AMP; Mental Retardation Authority of Harris County in Houston.
Rubenzer and his colleagues used ``the hottest personality
inventory test out there for people who research personality,'' and
asked 115 historians and biographers to rate the nation's 41
presidents on 600 personality items.
</P>
<P>
   But before you bring a personality scorecard to the polling
booth, the study's method is flawed, says Stanley Renshon, noted
prize-winning author of High Hopes: The Clinton Presidency and the
Politics of Ambition.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who do these kinds of studies think that because they
put a number on these kinds of characterizations, they have
'science.' They don't,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Rubenzer used a number of standardized personality profile
instruments, including the Revised NEO Personality Inventory. The
raters were restricted to the five years before the men were
elected to the highest office.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we found is that they tend to be more extroverted, lower
in openness to experience, less agreeable and higher in
conscientiousness,'' Rubenzer says. ``But the one that really
drives the ranking is their high score on achievement-striving.
Similarly, great presidents had a low score on straightforwardness
and modesty, and a low score on tender-mindedness.''
</P>
<P>
   Lack of straightforwardness is not dishonesty, Rubenzer insists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lincoln was known as an honest person, but he was willing to
change his message to one audience or another, and he was good with
the use of language. He was using all his abilities to persuade the
country to move in a certain direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings were presented last week at the 108th Annual
Convention of the American Psychological Association in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   But Renshon, who is also a professor of political science and a
psychoanalyst at City University of New York in New York City,
finds the finding on straightforwardness ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   ``So by that standard, we should then elect somebody who
promises to lie to us,'' he asks. ``That's so dumb it's
unbelievable. One of the most important features of presidents is
our ability to trust them. They're saying trust is not important,
and that flies in the face of almost any study I can think of.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with Rubenzer's study is it relies on the opinions
of historians and biographers, Renshon says.
</P>
<P>
   ``These presidents did not take the test themselves,'' he says.
``The biggest single problem is that they are giving people who are
not trained as psychologists these personality instruments and
asking them to make psychological analyses. What you are really
getting is their free associations.''

Health &AMP; Mental Retardation Authority of Harris County in Houston.
Rubenzer and his colleagues used ``the hottest personality
inventory test out there for people who research personality,'' and
asked 115 historians and biographers to rate the nation's 41
presidents on 600 personality items.
</P>
<P>
   But before you bring a personality scorecard to the polling
booth, the study's method is flawed, says Stanley Renshon, noted
prize-winning author of High Hopes: The Clinton Presidency and the
Politics of Ambition.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who do these kinds of studies think that because they
put a number on these kinds of characterizations, they have
'science.' They don't,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Rubenzer used a number of standardized personality profile
instruments, including the Revised NEO Personality Inventory. The
raters were restricted to the five years before the men were
elected to the highest office.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we found is that they tend to be more extroverted, lower
in openness to experience, less agreeable and higher in
conscientiousness,'' Rubenzer says. ``But the one that really
drives the ranking is their high score on achievement-striving.
Similarly, great presidents had a low score on straightforwardness
and modesty, and a low score on tender-mindedness.''
</P>
<P>
   Lack of straightforwardness is not dishonesty, Rubenzer insists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lincoln was known as an honest person, but he was willing to
change his message to one audience or another, and he was good with
the use of language. He was using all his abilities to persuade the
country to move in a certain direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings were presented last week at the 108th Annual
Convention of the American Psychological Association in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   But Renshon, who is also a professor of political science and a
psychoanalyst at City University of New York in New York City,
finds the finding on straightforwardness ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   ``So by that standard, we should then elect somebody who
promises to lie to us,'' he asks. ``That's so dumb it's
unbelievable. One of the most important features of presidents is
our ability to trust them. They're saying trust is not important,
and that flies in the face of almost any study I can think of.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with Rubenzer's study is it relies on the opinions
of historians and biographers, Renshon says.
</P>
<P>
   ``These presidents did not take the test themselves,'' he says.
``The biggest single problem is that they are giving people who are
not trained as psychologists these personality instruments and
asking them to make psychological analyses. What you are really
getting is their free associations.''

<P>
   Men as young as 35 are already showing their age, according to a
new study finding that changing sleep patterns in midlife could be
costing men as much as 75 percent of a hormone known to prevent
aging.
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies have focused on growth hormone deficiencies in
older men and women, a lack associated with increased obesity, loss
of muscle mass and reduced exercise capacity. But finding that the
hormone decrease starts when men are in their 30s was unexpected,
says Eve Van Cauter, professor of medicine at the University of
Chicago and lead author of the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``When drug intervention targets older adults, that usually
means over 65 years. The age range 35-50 is therefore younger that
what is considered the entry into old age,'' says Van Cauter.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the study appear in the Journal of the American
Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The study involved 149 healthy men, ages 16 to 83, none of whom
had a history of sleep disorders or took drugs. Researchers mapped
the chronology of age-related changes in sleep duration and found
that the first stage of declining sleep quality hits men between
the ages of 25 and 45.
</P>
<P>
   Although total sleep time remained constant as men moved into
midlife, the proportion of time spent in deep sleep declined from
20 percent for men under 25 to less than 5 percent for those over
35.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time their amount of growth hormone, which is
secreted primarily during deep sleep, declined by about 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This study suggests that growth-hormone replacement therapy
should be considered for younger men.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hyman Ryback, a White Plains, N.Y., otolaryngologist who
treats patients with sleep disorders, agrees with Van Cauter's
findings about the deterioration of sleep quality as men age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't confirm those numbers, but I see a lot of patients and
can confirm a lack of sleep as men get older.''
</P>
<P>
   But he would be skeptical about jumping into growth hormone
replacement therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of controversy about it. It's supposed to be a
fountain of youth for men, make muscles bigger, help with male
menopause ... but no one really knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Cauter has not conducted sleep/hormone studies with women
because their sleep quality is affected by a variety of other
factors including menstrual cycles, hot flashes and hormone
replacement therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Also studied by researchers was the second stage of
deterioration of sleep due to aging, which occurs after age 50, Van
Cauter says. Total sleep time begins to decrease by about 27
minutes for each decade into the 80s, and men experience more
frequent night-time awakenings and a significant reduction in rapid
eye movement (REM), or dream sleep.
</P>
<P>
   (Deep sleep and REM sleep are considered different categories of
sleep, according to experts, identified by different brain waves
and, of course, rapid eye movement.)
</P>
<P>
   A decrease in REM sleep appears to be associated with elevated
levels of cortisol, a stress-related hormone that heightens
attention and alertness. Cortisol levels normally peak in the
mornings and decline to low levels at night, matching a person's
sleep patterns, but those with decreased REM sleep appear to have
higher cortisol levels at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our data support the concept that decreased sleep quality
contributes to the wear and tear resulting from overactivity of the
stress-responsive systems,'' Van Cauter says.
</P>
<P>
   The news of the role of cortisol in sleep is not new, says
Ryback.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have different cortisol levels that peak at different
times _ you know the stories of early risers, late risers, night
owls,'' he says.

<P>
   Vincent van Gogh placed a foxglove flower in front of Dr. Paul
Gachet when he painted a portrait of the homeopathic doctor in
1890. During the last months of his life, van Gogh had sought help
for epilepsy from Gachet.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gogh's reference to foxglove, from which the drug digitalis
is derived, provides insight into his medical condition at the
time, says Dr. Paul Wolf, a university professor of pathology in
California. Too much digitalis, which van Gogh was taking, creates
a penchant for the color yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf, who studies how illness impacts the lives and creations of
the world's famous painters, composers, writers and political
leaders, talked about those effects to the annual meeting of the
American Association for Clinical Chemistry last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why van Gogh had a propensity to the color yellow hints at a
progressive toxic state,'' Wolf says. ``In his famous painting,
Starry Night, there are yellow circles around the stars. And that's
a symptom of an overdose of digitalis. Gachet tried digitalis to
try and clear up van Gogh's epilepsy, and it didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Yellow wasn't the only thing van Gogh loved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Van Gogh did have epilepsy, but that could have been due to
the fact that he drank a lot of absinthe, and absinthe has a poison
which affects the brain _ wormwood,'' Wolf says. ``The poison
causes the nervous system's cells to fire at will and so, in
reality, van Gogh may have had toxic epilepsy due to absinthe.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gogh also had ``a strange obsession with eating strange
things. He liked to taste his paints and drink turpentine. We think
these various toxins may have wreaked havoc with his vision and his
thinking processes,'' Wolf says.
</P>
<P>
   But while Wolf thinks illnesses have had profound effects on the
lives of creative geniuses, he still believes no one will ever
understand what really makes an artist tick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Van Gogh and Beethoven, for instance, were manic depressives,
and the idea that melancholy is associated with creativity goes
back to Grecian times. You don't have to be a manic person to be
creative, but there is a higher incidence of creativity in these
kinds of people. Ultimately creativity is a mystery, unknowable,''
he says. ``You may be able to ascribe genius and creativity to the
chemistry of the brain and to the genes, but it's not the whole
story, only part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf also speculates the condition that caused Ludwig van
Beethoven's deafness, Paget's disease, affected the composer's
creativity and productivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beethoven thought he went deaf because his father used to beat
him severely and caused brain damage and damage to his auditory
nerve, but Paget's disease not only caused deafness in Beethoven,
it caused him to get depressed, and it caused him to be an
alcoholic. Paget's disease in Beethoven cut off his productivity,''
Wolf says.
</P>
<P>
   Paget's disease is a chronic disorder that typically results in
enlarged and deformed bones, according to the National Institutes
of Health. The most common bone disease in the United States, it
can cause pain, deformities, hearing loss and can limit activity.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf says Beethoven's depression also may have been the
wellspring of his inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loneliness of the deafness and its resulting depression
could have expanded, in some way, his musical inspiration. When you
are very manic you have a flight of ideas, and when you are
depressed you don't create anything. You may need both sides to be
an artist,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   One art historian doubts the usefulness of such speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``How van Gogh saw, or whether he had yellow visions, or whether
he sucked the paint out of his brush, all these things are very
speculative and tend to represent the need of the physician who
proposes these things on the basis of their medical expertise and
not the basis of the extant literature,'' says Aaron Sheon, an art
history professor at the University of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my mind, the artist, to some extent, believe in their
specialness. But that's probably not any different than the myriad
of millionaires in Silicon Valley. What you have is a human being
who adapted to his physical situation rather than surrendering to
it,'' Sheon says.

 THERE'S MORE THAN FAST FOOD BETWEEN HERE AND SANTA FE 
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BEVERLY BUNDY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't have to pull a ``Thelma &AMP; Louise'' to justify a road
trip. Being more of the Kathy Bates persuasion myself (''I'm older
and I have better insurance''), I've taken to the road, headed west
on Interstate 30, in search of American food.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the Route 66 food of our childhoods: pecan logs at
Stuckey's and root beer floats at A&AMP;W. Nor is it our children's
road food: chicken and dumplings at Cracker Barrel or nuked
burritos from the Exxon station. This is real American food that is
doing just fine, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   So for the next few weeks, you'll be following along on an
Excellent Adventure, a sampler of what we're eating from Texas to
New Mexico to Nevada to California and back again.
</P>
<P>
   Cornudas Cafe &AMP; Gift Shop, U.S. 180 between Dell City and El
Paso, (915) 964-2409:
</P>
<P>
   West of Pecos is a little dot on the map that has been pumping
gas since the 1920s. It took tough folks to settle this dry, flat
land, and it appears that their descendants are just as tough.
</P>
<P>
   When I first called the Cornudas Cafe to find out if they were
open on Sundays, the woman who answered the phone said, ``Who is
this?'' A few weeks later I called to get the exact street address
and the man who answered the phone said, ``Who is this?'' You can't
be too careful.
</P>
<P>
   And the greeting isn't too much friendlier when you pull up to
the RV park/gas station/home of the $5 blanket/restaurant. The
waitress presents a menu written on a brown paper lunch sack and
impatiently taps her pen. ``What's good?'' ``Everything,'' she
says, tapping away.
</P>
<P>
   Well, they may not be friendly, but they know how to cook. The
tacos, indeed, were wonderful _ freshly fried flour tortillas were
stuffed with coarse hamburger pumped with chili powder. The beans
on the side were served in their broth and punctuated with onions _
not the refrieds we more often see in our neck of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let the door hit you on your way out, but do come back for
the burgers.
</P>
<P>
   Owl Bar Cafe &AMP; Steakhouse, U.S. 380, San Antonio, N.M., (505)
835-9946:
</P>
<P>
   We may think we take our chili seriously in Texas, but we're
only pretenders to the throne. It's the New Mexicans who are kings
of the mesa when it comes to chili.
</P>
<P>
   So to claim that San Antonio is home to New Mexico's most famous
green chili cheeseburger takes more than bravado.
</P>
<P>
   The burger is small by Texas standards, but what it lacks in
substance it makes up for in style. The patty is topped with a
slice of American cheese and finished with a spoonful from the
ever-bubbling caldron of green-chile chili.
</P>
<P>
   The mix of clientele is testament to the burger's renown. A
lopsided sign is pinned up behind the bar _ Sale to Intoxicated
Persons Prohibited _ but the attached Kappa Sigma sticker belies
the sign's effectiveness. The house wine appears to be the box of
Franzio white zinfandel on the shelf behind the bar. Yet a few
women of a certain age with pressed Bermudas, Marge Simpson hair
and straw bags politely waved at the help as they left the dark bar
for the blazing summer sun outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Mariscos La Playa Restaurant, 537 Cordova Road, Santa Fe, N.M.,
(505) 982-2790
</P>
<P>
   You'd think that Santa Feans would do better with Spanish than
they do. However, this local favorite is referred to as Mariscos by
one and all. Mariscos, those of us who did the homework our
sophomore year know, means seafood _ an odd name for a restaurant.
Sort of like saying, ``Hey, let's go to Hamburgers for lunch,''
when what we mean is, ``Let's go to Kincaid's.'' But if you ask for
directions, don't say La Playa _ no one calls the restaurant that.
And since everyone in Santa Fe is rich, you don't want to look poor
and dumb.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping in after a workday _ some people in Santa Fe do work,
polishing crystals and throwing pots _ we found it packed with
locals. And for good reason.
</P>
<P>
   The seafood is squeaky fresh and beautifully served without a
soupcon of pretension. We had a yen for oysters, but since August
doesn't have an ``R,'' we were a touch leery. But the T-shirted
waiter was at the top of his game, and when we asked the home port
of that evening's oysters, he said ``Seattle.'' A wonderful detail
at a restaurant that tops out at $30 for a meal for two.
</P>
<P>
   The oysters were pristine and so plump that we couldn't finish
the dozen. Another winner was raw shrimp marinated in lemon juice _
shells and all. Ringed with cucumber slices that had been peeled
and scored, the Mexican take on sushi was just the thing for a hot
summer night.
</P>
<P>
   Mariscos (there I go) also serves a terrific guacamole along
with its pico de gallo. The mashed avocados are blended with some
``crema'' and kicked up with some of the pico de gallo, yielding a
salsa with the taste of avocados but the consistency of green
goddess dressing. It's a definite twist to try at home.
</P>
<P>
   Next week _ a righteous breakfast in Grants, N.M., and Thai to
die for in Las Vegas.

   This afternoon, the Mercer Hotel in downtown Manhattan is a hive
of casual glamour. Courtney Love slumps in a corner sofa, smoking
cigarettes and drinking cappuccino with friends, while ``U-571''
actor Matthew McConaughey, clad in leather, struts through the
lobby and into a limousine. Upstairs, the biggest American rock
band of the '90s is sitting in a $2,000 suite, contemplating
politics and passivity. Pearl Jam singer Eddie Vedder, guitarist
Stone Gossard, and bassist Jeff Ament are wrestling with a
conundrum caused by ``Binaural,'' their sixth and latest album,
released May 23.
</P>
<P>
   The band is on tour through early November, with shows in about
40 U.S. cities. (It's their first substantial tour since nine
people died in a frenzied crush during the band's June 30 date at
the Roskilde festival near Copenhagen, Denmark, an event the band
terms ``a horrible nightmare.'') Pearl Jam has decreed that there
will be voter-registration tables situated around the arenas during
each show. The gesture has led to a dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   During the American tour, PJ will play to about a million
devoted fans, most of whom are 18 to 40 years old _ Democratic
consultant James Carville's dream demographic. Add other fans who
eagerly read Pearl Jam articles, Usenet groups, or Web sites like
www.tenclub.net, and the band has a large and active constituency.
Through the years, Pearl Jam has generously supported a number of
liberal causes. Because this tour coincides with a presidential
election, they are tempted to encourage fans to support a specific
candidate. But they aren't sure political sponsorship is a rock
band's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're gonna explain to them how to vote,''
Vedder says at first. ``I mean, there was one show we did, an
anti-Jesse Helms rally where we DID tell 'em how to vote,'' he adds
with a laugh. ``That was a no-brainer.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Vedder starts to change his mind. Recently,
he's become smitten with one of the presidential candidates. Not,
however, one of the two candidates with a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard Ralph Nader speak the other night, and I wish I could
borrow his brain for this interview,'' Vedder says. ``He was
talking about how there's not a two-party system, that it's a
one-party system, and it's all under the corporate umbrella. I
couldn't agree with him more.''
</P>
<P>
   Vedder continues to rhapsodize about Nader, but just when he
seems about to endorse the Green Party leader, he stops short.
Maybe it's because the band's last idealistic crusade ended in
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Pearl Jam declared war on Ticketmaster, the
entertainment behemoth that controls concert ticket sales through
exclusive contracts with most large arenas _ which, as Nader might
point out, hardly constitutes a free-market economy. Pearl Jam
tried to tour without Ticketmaster and failed painfully. Now, most
of the group's summer-tour tickets will be sold through their
archenemy. ``We're ready to concede. We have to use them,'' says
guitarist Gossard resignedly.
</P>
<P>
   For Vedder, Gossard and Ament _ plus guitarist Mike McCready and
drummer Matt Cameron _ idealism and cynicism are in constant
conflict. They'll happily sponsor voter registration, hoping young
voters will support liberal politicians. But for the most part,
they don't like Al Gore, and the one candidate they admire, Nader,
has no chance of winning. They understand the impulse to change the
world (as Crosby, Stills &AMP; Nash sang), but also the desire to rock
'n' roll all night (as Kiss sang). ``If we started talking about
politics onstage, people would laugh,'' says Gossard with a shrug.
``They want to hear 'our hits.'''
</P>
<P>
   The opposing urges of social activism and resignation can't be
reconciled. So sometimes Pearl Jam's members are philanthropists.
Sometimes they're martyrs. And sometimes they're just a rock band.
</P>
<P>
   Some art is manifestly political, like Bob Dylan's protest songs
or Michael Moore's anti-corporate films. But if entertainment
weren't inherently political, even when its message is oblique,
politicians wouldn't be so frightened by it. ``Culture,''
conservative candidate and commentator Pat Buchanan once observed,
``is the Ho Chi Minh Trail to power.''
</P>
<P>
   In many homes where parents are absent or uninterested, bands
function as moral surrogates, instructing kids on values. As Vedder
explains, a songwriter can chronicle social problems like a
reporter, but with a greater emotional urgency. Vedder often sings
about freedom and individualism and writes sympathetic portraits of
troubled women. His lyrics have denounced violent cops
(``W.M.A.''), guns (``Glorified G''), and organized religion (``Do
the Evolution'').
</P>
<P>
   Two dramatic songs from Pearl Jam's 1991 debut _ ``Jeremy,'' in
which an abused schoolkid takes bloody revenge on his tormentors,
and ``Alive,'' about parental deceit and Oedipal drama _ quickly
made the band famous. ``Troubled souls unite,'' Vedder declared.
And a young generation raised on sitcoms, Ritalin and divorce
responded avidly.
</P>
<P>
   Vedder had a nearly allergic reaction to fame. He's complained
about stardom (sample quote: ``I'm just not that happy a person''),
bad-mouthed MTV, and when Pearl Jam and Nirvana made Seattle-rock
famous, refused to talk to Time magazine for a cover story. Even
now, plenty of people see him as Angry Eddie, a whiny grouch, the
Cassandra of grunge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind that,'' Vedder says merrily. ``The fact that
we're perceived as humorless pricks allows me to go into a bar, sit
in the corner and not have everyone come say hello. There's a nice
force field that goes along with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Last November, while Pearl Jam was in a Seattle studio recording
``Binaural,'' their hometown was overturned by protesters enraged
by the World Trade Organization meetings. ``I was so extremely
impressed to see that protest was still viable,'' Vedder says.
</P>
<P>
   While watching the mayhem, he finished writing ``Grievance,'' a
Binaural song that mocks affluence and consumption, regards
computers as tools of government surveillance, and includes a
characteristic PJ image, in which non-conformism is punished with
violence. ``I pledge my grievance to the flag,'' Vedder sings. He
hopes the song will encourage protest to bloom.
</P>
<P>
   Vedder talks haltingly and avoids direct eye-contact. Like a lot
of high-school dropouts who read avidly, he seems uneasy expressing
knowledge. To explain his opinions, he invokes books he admires _
Howard Zinn's anti-capitalist analyses of American history, and
Visions, Michio Kaku's alarmist view of the scientific future.
Despite his reputation as a sanctimonious brooder, he frequently
cracks dry jokes, and even smiles broadly enough to display
rarely-seen dimples.
</P>
<P>
   For all the impact of Pearl Jam's songs, Vedder says ``our
politics may be more in our actions than in our music.'' At a time
when many bands unabashedly align with beer companies or clothing
designers, PJ is widely admired for its relatively anti-corporate
values.
</P>
<P>
   The band refuses corporate sponsorships, and has made only a few
music videos, eschewing the support of the almighty MTV. Their
failed jihad against Ticketmaster cost them an estimated $30
million in revenue, and their criminal complaint with the Justice
Department _ alleging that Ticketmaster held a monopoly in the $1
billion concert industry _ elicited only a House investigation that
was quickly squashed by high-powered corporate lawyers and pols.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awesome,'' says Vedder, with a loud laugh. ``It was
great to find out what it's like to be crushed by a huge corporate
superpower.'' He now calls the defeat ``a template for how
'politics' works. When you put that template onto an issue like the
environment or taking jobs out of the country, then it becomes
really frightening.'' No wonder Vedder is so attracted to Ralph
Nader's anti-capitalist message.
</P>
<P>
   In one way, Pearl Jam is very much like any other Seattle-based
corporation run by young millionaires: They give away lots of
money. Since 1992, the band has donated more than $2.2 million to
causes ranging from the environment and Native Americans to
education and abortion rights. They have also played benefits for
the homeless, AIDS, and Tibetan freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, they helped raise $6.7 million for Kosovo relief by
donating all the royalties from their Top Five hit single ``Last
Kiss.'' Recently, publicist Nicole Vandenberg, who coordinates PJ's
political activities, helped them establish a charitable
foundation, which hopes to give away $500,000 every two years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their shared devotion to liberalism, the members of
Pearl Jam come from dramatically disparate backgrounds. ``Punk
rock,'' says Jeff Ament, 37, ``introduced me to politics, in a lot
of ways.'' Ament grew up a ``redneck'' all-state basketball star in
Big Sandy, a tiny town in northern Montana. Ament's dad was a
farmer and an insurance salesman, not to mention the town barber
and its mayor. ``He was very pro-Nixon,'' Ament says. ``Until I was
16, my dad was my hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Ament's view of his father changed _ as did his political views
_ when he began to hear the dissident opinions of leftist
hardcore-punk groups like the Dead Kennedys, Millions of Dead Cops,
and Crass. After graduating from the liberal University of Montana,
he ``had a brutal seven or eight years'' of conflicts with his
father. The two have since made peace; the muscular bassist now
focuses his disgust on Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., a champion of
gun ownership whom Ament calls ``one of the biggest idiots in
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Guitarist Stone Gossard, 33, embodies Pearl Jam's skeptical
side. Unlike Ament, he was raised in privileged circumstances, the
son of a prominent Seattle lawyer. His Democratic parents sent him
to an alternative, multicultural high school, where history lessons
included prolonged discussions of U.S. involvement in political
assassinations. Now Gossard espouses realpolitik, which values
compromise as a necessity, and recognizes the triumph of power as
an inevitability.
</P>
<P>
   Yet today in the hotel suite, Gossard disparages the Marxist
advocacy of PJ's younger Sony Music labelmate Rage Against the
Machine, the hard-rock socialists whose didactic rants have topped
the charts. Rage performed Aug. 14 at a protest rally outside the
Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, which ended in a
rowdy confrontation with police after some of the protesters threw
bottles and stones at some officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you get older,'' Gossard reflects, ``you start to see the
complexity of issues, and you go, 'I don't want to hear you talk
about, you know, corporate fuckin' whatchamacallit when you're on
the Sony tit, and you're making videos.''' Rage Against the
Machine, Gossard alleges, denounce politicians for their
immorality, but are hardly upright themselves, which makes their
songs ``sound sort of hypocritical.''
</P>
<P>
   With Eddie Vedder, the path from his politics and values back to
his upbringing is clear and direct. ``I had a complicated family
history,'' he says softly, and punctuates the understatement with
an ironic smile.
</P>
<P>
   He was born Edward Louis Severson III, but his father, the
senior Severson, divorced Eddie's mother before their son was two.
She remarried and never told Eddie about his real father _ instead,
she raised him in the San Diego suburbs as Eddie Mueller, the
surname of her second husband. Eddie occasionally saw Severson, but
believed he was merely a ``family friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie hated his stepfather, and in the past has called him an
``evil, evil'' man. When Eddie was in high school, his mother
revealed the family secret and announced that Eddie's real father
had died when the boy was 13, an incident alluded to in the Pearl
Jam song ``Alive.'' When he learned the truth, Eddie dropped
Mueller in favor of his mother's maiden name, Vedder.
</P>
<P>
   Vedder's denunciation of his stepfather and his thematic
fascination with the abuses of power, including child abuse, raise
the question: Was he an abused child?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he says with a cautious pause. ``I probably had a very
normal upbringing that had some discipline in it that maybe wasn't
necessarily appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not a very clear answer _ it's neither an affirmation nor
a denial. Did his stepdad hit him? ``I'm not gonna say no,'' Vedder
replies. But out of love for his mother, who raised four sons,
``I'd rather not talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Given this family history, it's not surprising that Vedder,
who's been married for six years to Beth Liebling, still finds
symbolic struggles against power and authority compelling.
Ticketmaster, the police, China and the two-party system are all
monolithic enemies that cause Angry Eddie to re-emerge. ``I do get
riled up in an adolescent manner,'' Vedder admits, laughing at
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Pearl Jam has been supplanted atop the charts lately
by imitators like Creed, a young Christian-rock band from Florida
that emulates PJ's stormy sound. Although Vedder claims to have not
heard Creed, he playfully taunts the band: ``Imitation is the
highest form of flattery. Consider me flattered. I just hope their
songwriting gets better.''
</P>
<P>
   Rock's influence has abated in the 10 years since fans first
rallied around Pearl Jam. The release of ``Binaural'' comes at a
time when radio is ruled by innocuous teen acts like the Backstreet
Boys. Partly because of their anti-commercial attitude, Pearl Jam's
sales have declined; their last two studio records _ 1996's ``No
Code'' and 1998's Yield'' _ sold around 2 million copies each, far
below the 7 million sales averaged by their first three albums. And
they don't plan to promote the new record by filming a music video.
``Unless we can get Ralph Nader to do one,'' quips Ament.
</P>
<P>
   In Pearl Jam's career, a generation's opposing instincts of
protest and passivity, resolve and resignation, come to conflict.
Vedder addresses this conflict on ``Binaural,'' in the apocalyptic
song ``Insignificance'': as falling bombs bring death to a small
American town, the doomed gather in a bar, dancing while a protest
song plays harmlessly on the jukebox. The oblique moral, Vedder
explains, is the ineffectiveness of political struggle _ a theme
his hero, Pete Townshend, expressed in the Who's rock classic
``Won't Get Fooled Again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only do so much,'' Vedder says. ``Y'know, do your
laundry, tip the waiter, talk to the homeless, be part of the
community, love your friends. And that's about it. No real reason
to try too hard at any of this.'' And yet Pearl Jam does try.
``Yep, '' Vedder shrugs. ``The girl can't help it.''
</P>
<P>
   So while he tips waiters and participates in the community,
Vedder also daydreams about giving Nader's campaign a boost. He
knows Pearl Jam can't get Nader elected. Is it possible that they
could help him capture 5 percent of the presidential vote, and
thereby qualify his Green Party for millions of dollars in federal
campaign matching funds?
</P>
<P>
   Stone Gossard doesn't think so. ``Do you know how many votes
'Pearl Jam's support' would effectively change?'' he scoffs. ``You
might get 5,000 people to kind of look at it, and 1,000 people 'to
vote for Nader.' American politics will always be a two-party
race.'' Nader's campaign, he adds dismissively, is just ``a great
publicity stunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Gossard says with a discerning laugh, Vedder ``never
wants to do anything that someone tells him to do.'' He says that
``if Eddie felt like it was a responsibility'' to support Nader
onstage, the recalcitrant singer would soon lose interest and
abandon the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the root of Vedder's conflict: Although he's reluctant
to anoint himself a political advocate, he regrets the country's
widespread apathy. He declares a responsibility to ``at least
dabble in'' sponsoring political change. But he acknowledges that
openly promoting a candidate onstage might alienate his fans and
perhaps his bandmates.
</P>
<P>
   He imagines addressing a bored fan during a concert. '''If you
fucking voted, I wouldn't have to be talking about this. If you
fucking educated yourself, instead of listening to fucking inane
rock music _ I'm not talking about ours, I'm talking about the
other bands _ maybe we wouldn't have to bring this up.'''
</P>
<P>
   So why not go out on a limb and tell fans about Nader? ``You
know what? I think we will,'' says Vedder. ``It sounds like a great
idea.'' Eddie Vedder has made up his mind. He's endorsed Ralph
Nader. ``And in a perfect world,'' he adds with a chuckle, ``Howard
Zinn could be vice president.''

   This afternoon, the Mercer Hotel in downtown Manhattan is a hive
of casual glamour. Courtney Love slumps in a corner sofa, smoking
cigarettes and drinking cappuccino with friends, while ``U-571''
actor Matthew McConaughey, clad in leather, struts through the
lobby and into a limousine. Upstairs, the biggest American rock
band of the '90s is sitting in a $2,000 suite, contemplating
politics and passivity. Pearl Jam singer Eddie Vedder, guitarist
Stone Gossard, and bassist Jeff Ament are wrestling with a
conundrum caused by ``Binaural,'' their sixth and latest album,
released May 23.
</P>
<P>
   The band is on tour through early November, with shows in about
40 U.S. cities. (It's their first substantial tour since nine
people died in a frenzied crush during the band's June 30 date at
the Roskilde festival near Copenhagen, Denmark, an event the band
terms ``a horrible nightmare.'') Pearl Jam has decreed that there
will be voter-registration tables situated around the arenas during
each show. The gesture has led to a dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   During the American tour, PJ will play to about a million
devoted fans, most of whom are 18 to 40 years old _ Democratic
consultant James Carville's dream demographic. Add other fans who
eagerly read Pearl Jam articles, Usenet groups, or Web sites like
www.tenclub.net, and the band has a large and active constituency.
Through the years, Pearl Jam has generously supported a number of
liberal causes. Because this tour coincides with a presidential
election, they are tempted to encourage fans to support a specific
candidate. But they aren't sure political sponsorship is a rock
band's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're gonna explain to them how to vote,''
Vedder says at first. ``I mean, there was one show we did, an
anti-Jesse Helms rally where we DID tell 'em how to vote,'' he adds
with a laugh. ``That was a no-brainer.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Vedder starts to change his mind. Recently,
he's become smitten with one of the presidential candidates. Not,
however, one of the two candidates with a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard Ralph Nader speak the other night, and I wish I could
borrow his brain for this interview,'' Vedder says. ``He was
talking about how there's not a two-party system, that it's a
one-party system, and it's all under the corporate umbrella. I
couldn't agree with him more.''
</P>
<P>
   Vedder continues to rhapsodize about Nader, but just when he
seems about to endorse the Green Party leader, he stops short.
Maybe it's because the band's last idealistic crusade ended in
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Pearl Jam declared war on Ticketmaster, the
entertainment behemoth that controls concert ticket sales through
exclusive contracts with most large arenas _ which, as Nader might
point out, hardly constitutes a free-market economy. Pearl Jam
tried to tour without Ticketmaster and failed painfully. Now, most
of the group's summer-tour tickets will be sold through their
archenemy. ``We're ready to concede. We have to use them,'' says
guitarist Gossard resignedly.
</P>
<P>
   For Vedder, Gossard and Ament _ plus guitarist Mike McCready and
drummer Matt Cameron _ idealism and cynicism are in constant

voters will support liberal politicians. But for the most part,
they don't like Al Gore, and the one candidate they admire, Nader,

'n' roll all night (as Kiss sang). ``If we started talking about

``They want to hear 'our hits.'''
</P>
<P>
   The opposing urges of social activism and resignation can't be

Sometimes they're martyrs. And sometimes they're just a rock band.

   Two dramatic songs from Pearl Jam's 1991 debut _ ``Jeremy,'' in
which an abused schoolkid takes bloody revenge on his tormentors,
and ``Alive,'' about parental deceit and Oedipal drama _ quickly
made the band famous. ``Troubled souls unite,'' Vedder declared.

Mueller in favor of his mother's maiden name, Vedder.
</P>
<P>
   Vedder's denunciation of his stepfather and his thematic
fascination with the abuses of power, including child abuse, raise
the question: Was he an abused child?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he says with a cautious pause. ``I probably had a very
normal upbringing that had some discipline in it that maybe wasn't
necessarily appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not a very clear answer _ it's neither an affirmation nor
a denial. Did his stepdad hit him? ``I'm not gonna say no,'' Vedder
replies. But out of love for his mother, who raised four sons,
``I'd rather not talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Given this family history, it's not surprising that Vedder,
who's been married for six years to Beth Liebling, still finds
symbolic struggles against power and authority compelling.
Ticketmaster, the police, China and the two-party system are all
monolithic enemies that cause Angry Eddie to re-emerge. ``I do get
riled up in an adolescent manner,'' Vedder admits, laughing at
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Pearl Jam has been supplanted atop the charts lately
by imitators like Creed, a young Christian-rock band from Florida
that emulates PJ's stormy sound. Although Vedder claims to have not
heard Creed, he playfully taunts the band: ``Imitation is the
highest form of flattery. Consider me flattered. I just hope their
songwriting gets better.''
</P>
<P>
   Rock's influence has abated in the 10 years since fans first
rallied around Pearl Jam. The release of ``Binaural'' comes at a
time when radio is ruled by innocuous teen acts like the Backstreet
Boys. Partly because of their anti-commercial attitude, Pearl Jam's
sales have declined; their last two studio records _ 1996's ``No
Code'' and 1998's Yield'' _ sold around 2 million copies each, far
below the 7 million sales averaged by their first three albums. And
they don't plan to promote the new record by filming a music video.
``Unless we can get Ralph Nader to do one,'' quips Ament.
</P>
<P>
   In Pearl Jam's career, a generation's opposing instincts of
protest and passivity, resolve and resignation, come to conflict.
Vedder addresses this conflict on ``Binaural,'' in the apocalyptic
song ``Insignificance'': as falling bombs bring death to a small
American town, the doomed gather in a bar, dancing while a protest
song plays harmlessly on the jukebox. The oblique moral, Vedder
explains, is the ineffectiveness of political struggle _ a theme
his hero, Pete Townshend, expressed in the Who's rock classic
``Won't Get Fooled Again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only do so much,'' Vedder says. ``Y'know, do your
laundry, tip the waiter, talk to the homeless, be part of the
community, love your friends. And that's about it. No real reason
to try too hard at any of this.'' And yet Pearl Jam does try.
``Yep, '' Vedder shrugs. ``The girl can't help it.''
</P>
<P>
   So while he tips waiters and participates in the community,
Vedder also daydreams about giving Nader's campaign a boost. He
knows Pearl Jam can't get Nader elected. Is it possible that they
could help him capture 5 percent of the presidential vote, and
thereby qualify his Green Party for millions of dollars in federal
campaign matching funds?
</P>
<P>
   Stone Gossard doesn't think so. ``Do you know how many votes
'Pearl Jam's support' would effectively change?'' he scoffs. ``You
might get 5,000 people to kind of look at it, and 1,000 people 'to
vote for Nader.' American politics will always be a two-party
race.'' Nader's campaign, he adds dismissively, is just ``a great
publicity stunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Gossard says with a discerning laugh, Vedder ``never
wants to do anything that someone tells him to do.'' He says that
``if Eddie felt like it was a responsibility'' to support Nader
onstage, the recalcitrant singer would soon lose interest and
abandon the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the root of Vedder's conflict: Although he's reluctant
to anoint himself a political advocate, he regrets the country's
widespread apathy. He declares a responsibility to ``at least
dabble in'' sponsoring political change. But he acknowledges that
openly promoting a candidate onstage might alienate his fans and
perhaps his bandmates.
</P>
<P>
   He imagines addressing a bored fan during a concert. '''If you
fucking voted, I wouldn't have to be talking about this. If you
fucking educated yourself, instead of listening to fucking inane
rock music _ I'm not talking about ours, I'm talking about the
other bands _ maybe we wouldn't have to bring this up.'''
</P>
<P>
   So why not go out on a limb and tell fans about Nader? ``You
know what? I think we will,'' says Vedder. ``It sounds like a great
idea.'' Eddie Vedder has made up his mind. He's endorsed Ralph
Nader. ``And in a perfect world,'' he adds with a chuckle, ``Howard
Zinn could be vice president.''

 THERE'S MORE THAN FAST FOOD BETWEEN HERE AND SANTA FE 
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BEVERLY BUNDY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't have to pull a ``Thelma &AMP; Louise'' to justify a road
trip. Being more of the Kathy Bates persuasion myself (''I'm older
and I have better insurance''), I've taken to the road, headed west
on Interstate 30, in search of American food.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the Route 66 food of our childhoods: pecan logs at
Stuckey's and root beer floats at A&AMP;W. Nor is it our children's
road food: chicken and dumplings at Cracker Barrel or nuked
burritos from the Exxon station. This is real American food that is
doing just fine, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   So for the next few weeks, you'll be following along on an
Excellent Adventure, a sampler of what we're eating from Texas to
New Mexico to Nevada to California and back again.
</P>
<P>
   Cornudas Cafe &AMP; Gift Shop, U.S. 180 between Dell City and El
Paso, (915) 964-2409:
</P>
<P>
   West of Pecos is a little dot on the map that has been pumping
gas since the 1920s. It took tough folks to settle this dry, flat
land, and it appears that their descendants are just as tough.
</P>
<P>
   When I first called the Cornudas Cafe to find out if they were
open on Sundays, the woman who answered the phone said, ``Who is
this?'' A few weeks later I called to get the exact street address
and the man who answered the phone said, ``Who is this?'' You can't
be too careful.
</P>
<P>
   And the greeting isn't too much friendlier when you pull up to
the RV park/gas station/home of the $5 blanket/restaurant. The
waitress presents a menu written on a brown paper lunch sack and
impatiently taps her pen. ``What's good?'' ``Everything,'' she
says, tapping away.
</P>
<P>
   Well, they may not be friendly, but they know how to cook. The
tacos, indeed, were wonderful _ freshly fried flour tortillas were
stuffed with coarse hamburger pumped with chili powder. The beans
on the side were served in their broth and punctuated with onions _
not the refrieds we more often see in our neck of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let the door hit you on your way out, but do come back for
the burgers.
</P>
<P>
   Owl Bar Cafe &AMP; Steakhouse, U.S. 380, San Antonio, N.M., (505)
835-9946:
</P>
<P>
   We may think we take our chili seriously in Texas, but we're
only pretenders to the throne. It's the New Mexicans who are kings
of the mesa when it comes to chili.
</P>
<P>
   So to claim that San Antonio is home to New Mexico's most famous
green chili cheeseburger takes more than bravado.
</P>
<P>
   The burger is small by Texas standards, but what it lacks in
substance it makes up for in style. The patty is topped with a
slice of American cheese and finished with a spoonful from the
ever-bubbling caldron of green-chile chili.
</P>
<P>
   The mix of clientele is testament to the burger's renown. A
lopsided sign is pinned up behind the bar _ Sale to Intoxicated
Persons Prohibited _ but the attached Kappa Sigma sticker belies
the sign's effectiveness. The house wine appears to be the box of
Franzio white zinfandel on the shelf behind the bar. Yet a few
women of a certain age with pressed Bermudas, Marge Simpson hair
and straw bags politely waved at the help as they left the dark bar
for the blazing summer sun outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Mariscos La Playa Restaurant, 537 Cordova Road, Santa Fe, N.M.,
(505) 982-2790
</P>
<P>
   You'd think that Santa Feans would do better with Spanish than
they do. However, this local favorite is referred to as Mariscos by
one and all. Mariscos, those of us who did the homework our
sophomore year know, means seafood _ an odd name for a restaurant.
Sort of like saying, ``Hey, let's go to Hamburgers for lunch,''
when what we mean is, ``Let's go to Kincaid's.'' But if you ask for
directions, don't say La Playa _ no one calls the restaurant that.
And since everyone in Santa Fe is rich, you don't want to look poor
and dumb.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping in after a workday _ some people in Santa Fe do work,
polishing crystals and throwing pots _ we found it packed with
locals. And for good reason.
</P>
<P>
   The seafood is squeaky fresh and beautifully served without a
soupcon of pretension. We had a yen for oysters, but since August
doesn't have an ``R,'' we were a touch leery. But the T-shirted
waiter was at the top of his game, and when we asked the home port
of that evening's oysters, he said ``Seattle.'' A wonderful detail
at a restaurant that tops out at $30 for a meal for two.
</P>
<P>
   The oysters were pristine and so plump that we couldn't finish
the dozen. Another winner was raw shrimp marinated in lemon juice _
shells and all. Ringed with cucumber slices that had been peeled
and scored, the Mexican take on sushi was just the thing for a hot
summer night.
</P>
<P>
   Mariscos (there I go) also serves a terrific guacamole along
with its pico de gallo. The mashed avocados are blended with some
``crema'' and kicked up with some of the pico de gallo, yielding a
salsa with the taste of avocados but the consistency of green
goddess dressing. It's a definite twist to try at home.
</P>
<P>
   Next week _ a righteous breakfast in Grants, N.M., and Thai to
die for in Las Vegas.

   CVN-INTERNET (Los Angeles) _ Of course Al Gore didn't invent the

the Democrats are doing a slightly better job than the Republicans
in embracing their first national convention on the information

 `MARRIAGE PENALTY' RAISES CONSCIOUSNESS, IF NOT IRE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; DEDHAM, Mass. _ As Allison Hazen stood on a platform getting
fitted for her wedding gown, she and bridal shop owner Rachelle
Avola talked about love, finances, and the so-called marriage tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``When filing jointly, you're definitely getting hit hard with a
higher tax rate,'' said Hazen, 29, an attorney and budget director
for a member of the state Senate Ways and Means Committee, as Avola
took up the hem of her white jacquard gown.
</P>
<P>
   The longstanding tax arose by historical accident and now
penalizes about 50 to 60 percent of married couples, particularly
those with both husband and wife earning paychecks. Last month,
Congress passed a bill to reduce the tax, but last Saturday
President Clinton vetoed it as poorly targeted.
</P>
<P>
   Like the millions of couples affected every year, Hazen and her
fiance, also a lawyer, aren't letting the tax get in the way of
love and romance; they're walking down the aisle next month. And,
like many other soon-to-be married couples, they haven't taken any
special financial steps to minimize the impact of the tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know about budgets and know about the tax, and you're
not doing anything about it, I bet other young people wouldn't,
either,'' Avola told Hazen as she trimmed and pinned the gown at
her shop, Emma's of Dedham, which has been in business under
various owners since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the marriage tax _ which takes an estimated $29
billion from about 20 million married couples' pockets each year _
has reached a feverish pitch in Washington this presidential
election year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clinton's veto of the marriage tax cut bill, Republicans
say they will bring up the issue again this year.
</P>
<P>
   The quirk in the US tax code that now creates a marriage penalty
_ income splitting between husband and wife _ first went on the
books in 1948 and actually served as a marriage subsidy for most
couples until 1969. Back when most couples had only one breadwinner
_ the husband _ splitting the income between husband and wife meant
being taxed in a lower bracket.
</P>
<P>
   But since 1969, with changes in tax laws and the growing number
of women in the work force, married couples have been increasingly
penalized, with a record proportion now having to pay hundreds to
thousands of dollars a year more than they would have, had they
stayed single.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does send a kind of odd message from the government _ `You
should pay extra taxes if you get married,' '' said Daniel
Feenberg, a research associate for the Cambridge-based National
Bureau of Economic Research who has studied the marriage tax.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 Congressional Budget Office report on marriage and the
federal income tax found that between 1969 and 1995, the proportion
of working-age married couples with both spouses earning paychecks
jumped from 48.4 percent to 71.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some married couples still get a subsidy today, however _ those
in which only one spouse works, or those with a big difference
between the incomes of the two spouses.
</P>
<P>
   Why are some couples penalized while others are subsidized? It
has to do with the progressive nature of the US tax rates. When two
spouses work, their combined incomes could kick them up into a
higher marginal tax bracket. When only one earns a paycheck, the
income is split, allowing more of the money to be taxed at lower
rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think progressivity is an important value and marriage
neutrality is an important value,'' said research associate
Feenberg. ``All these things have to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a presidential election year, of course, talking about a
marriage tax cut wins out over discussing the progressive tax
system.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans say they will bring up the marriage tax issue
again when Congress returns from its August recess. The Republicans
probably won't have enough votes to override Clinton's veto and
would need to revise their $292 billion marriage tax cut proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and most Democrats objected to the bill as benefiting
higher-income families and couples already getting a marriage
subsidy, and have offered alternatives. In his veto statement,
Clinton also criticized the Republican-controlled Congress for
failing to use the projected budget surplus to strengthen Social
Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing how government works, bride-to-be Hazen didn't plan her
wedding around the election-year marriage tax debate or change her
financial plans in other ways because of the impending tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are steps you can take, like changing the timing
of your wedding,'' she said, and increasing 401(k) contributions or
making a deductible Individual Retirement Account contribution if
you qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Hazen said she and her fiance have also thought about buying a
house, which would give them a mortgage-interest deduction that
``definitely offsets the higher tax rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Avola, of Emma's of Dedham, said business is strong this year,
with lots of couples taking their vows, marriage tax or not. ``It's
the millennium bug and the love bug,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That bug will be in full force Wednesday at Filene's Basement in
Downtown Crossing, where hundreds of brides-to-be will rush the
store's annual 8 a.m. bridal gown sale, marriage tax be damned.
</P>
<P>
   While most people are like Hazen and don't take tax-minimizing
steps before they take their vows, emerging economics research and
anecdotal evidence suggest there are some people who will go to
lengths to avoid or minimize the marriage tax.
</P>
<P>
   One series of studies has found that some people will delay or
even forgo marriage because of the tax, while others will divorce
in part because of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've tended to find in all this is that economic
incentives _ including taxes _ matter,'' said James Alm, chairman
of the economics department at Georgia State's Andrew Young School
of Policy Studies, who has coauthored studies on the tax's impact
on marriage and divorce with Leslie Whittington of Georgetown
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a lot of people, it's not a big response,'' Alm said.
For most people, ``other things seem to explain the marriage
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Slemrod, director of the Office of Tax Policy Research at
the University of Michigan Business School, said the research
literature suggests even the most tax-conscious people still will
marry, although they may wed in January instead of December to gain
another year penalty-free.
</P>
<P>
   The literature shows similar timing decisions made by the
tax-conscious, said Slemrod, coauthor of the book ``Taxing
Ourselves: A Citizen's Guide to the Great Debate over Tax Reform.''
Such decisions encompass everything from the best month to have a
baby (December, to get a full year's tax deduction), to the best
month to sell stock (depends on whether you're realizing a loss or
trying to hold on to a profitable stock long enough for the lower,
long-term capital gains rate, among other factors).
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Crannage, owner of Gowns by Elizabeth in Stoneham,
said she averages about half a dozen brides a year who consciously
marry in January rather than December. Crannage, who makes and
designs wedding gowns, said many of her customers are lawyers and
other professionals who know about the tax impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk a lot about taxes and about being married and the
financial consequences,'' said Crannage. ``It can cost quite a bit
of money.''
</P>
<P>
   One of her clients, Maureen Burke, 34, said, ``I definitely
wouldn't get married on Dec. 31. That would definitely enter into
my mind. For the sake of one day, you'd get hit.''
</P>
<P>
   But Burke, who works in the financial services industry, and her
husband, who's in computer software, didn't marry in January,
either. Instead, they chose to wed in autumn, six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Burke has friends who've said they didn't want to get married
because of the tax hit. ``I've heard that more than once,'' she
said, although many have since wed.
</P>
<P>
   The current marriage tax debate highlights such ongoing tax
policy considerations as whether taxation should reflect social
changes, be used in an attempt to shape behavior, or be used to
simply raise revenues in as equitable a way as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, tax policy just comes down to politics.
</P>
<P>
   Even in 1948, when the US tax code first allowed income
splitting, subsidizing most married couples in those days, the
change came not from the federal government wanting husbands to
work and wives to stay at home. It came in response to some states
adopting community property laws that allowed income splitting,
according to tax historians.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1948, individuals were separately taxed on their own
incomes, whether married or not. Some tax policy specialists favor
returning to that as a way to address the current inequity of some
married couples getting a subsidy while other married couples and
singles don't.
</P>
<P>
   If taxation were just about raising revenues and not about
making a social or political statement, the federal government
could take in between $300 million to $1.3 billion more through the
marriage tax if it were to recognize gay and lesbian couples as
legally married, according to a study in the National Tax Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Badgett, assistant professor of economics at the University
of Massachusetts, Amherst, and coauthor of the study with tax
researchers Alm and Whittington, became interested in this topic as
a result of the debate over same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   In their calling for legal recognition of same-sex marriages,
``Gay and lesbian people are wanting to have access to more
rights,'' such as the spousal health benefits that heterosexual
married couples receive, Badgett said. But as her study shows,
``There's a financial downside to getting married.''
</P>
<P>
   A cut in the marriage tax ``benefits me potentially, so that's
good,'' said Hazen, as she finished her wedding gown fitting at
Emma's of Dedham. But she also knows there are other needs the
federal government must weigh in considering any tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   For Hazen, who knows about the financial downside that will come
with her September marriage, the marriage tax is worthy of debate.

</P>
<P>
   While most couples pay more taxes after marriage than when
single, some get a tax subsidy, particularly if only one spouse
works. A bill passed last month by Congress would have lowered the
marriage tax for most couples now facing a penalty, but also would
have given even more of a break to those who already receive a
subsidy. President Clinton vetoed the bill Aug. 5, saying it was
poorly targeted and demanding that his alternatives be considered.
Republicans say they will bring the issue up again when Congress
returns from recess.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a comparison of hypothetical scenarios under the 1999 tax
rules and what Congress had proposed for 2000. The marriage penalty
reflects how much more in taxes the two-earner couple pays,
compared with being single and being taxed on their income
separately. The marriage subsidy reflects how much less in taxes
the one-earner couple pays compared with a single person with the
same income.

   The dish: Salad sampler of fruit salad, chicken salad, and tuna
and pasta salad.
</P>
<P>
   This is almost a trick question. The fruit flavors of the salad
complement almost every varietal. Chicken salad, with or without an
Oriental twist, belongs with dry chenin blanc, a riesling or a
sancerre. Add tuna and pasta, and a rose becomes the wine of the
moment. It's amazing when you realize the flexibility threshold. Or
try a viognier, a gewurztraminer or a pinot grigio. You are safe
and happy _ be it a Saturday lunch or Sunday night supper.

responded, as he always has, by going back to school. He put

learn from and are even transformed by a good drubbing at the

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, this column focused on the preliminaries for building
a fence. When you have the necessary materials, you can begin
construction.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to set the posts in the ground. Begin with the
end posts. Fence posts should be set to a depth of at least 32
inches. They can be held in place with either packed dirt or
concrete.
</P>
<P>
   You can use a clamshell-type posthole digger if you only have a
few holes to dig, but for a long fence you might want to rent a
power auger to bore holes. The holes should have flat solid
bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   Two problems that you may encounter are rocks and tree roots.
</P>
<P>
   Try to dislodge rocks with a pry bar and a pick. If the rock is
too large to be moved, you may have to relocate the fence post.
</P>
<P>
   Tree roots are less of a problem because you can cut the smaller
ones and shift the hole slightly to avoid the larger ones.
</P>
<P>
   Place each end post in its hole and fill it with about six to
eight inches of soil. Use a level to make sure the post is
perfectly vertical on all four sides, then tamp the dirt down
around the post with a piece of 2 by 2. Start gently on one side,
and then work around the post with more forceful strokes. Be
careful not to tamp too hard on any one side; you could push the
post out of plumb.
</P>
<P>
   When the end posts are in place, run a line between them and
locate the positions for the section posts. Dig the holes, then set
the posts in them, using the same tamping technique that you
applied to the end posts.
</P>
<P>
   After setting all the posts, step back and check their
alignment. Are they all in line? Are the tops even? Are they all
straight? If not, now is the time to make corrections.
</P>
<P>
   If you are satisfied with the posts, you can fill the holes with
either dirt or concrete. Whether you use dirt or concrete, it is
important to shape the top of the fill so it slopes away from the
post. This raked profile will shed water that might otherwise
collect around the post and penetrate the wood, causing rot.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to nail the stringers in place with 10-penny
galvanized nails. The stringers are the long boards that run
horizontally between the posts to provide a support for the
pickets.
</P>
<P>
   They will have to be toenailed, that is, drive the nails at an
angle through the top of the stringer into the vertical side of the
post. Toenailing horizontal members like stringers presents a
problem because the downward force of the hammer blows tends to
knock the pieces out of alignment.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways to prevent this. You can enlist the aid of a
strong-armed helper to hold each stringer as you nail it in place,
or if you are working alone, you can use spacer blocks to support
the stringers as you toenail. Start with the bottom stringer first.
It should be about 13 inches from the ground. Cut two pieces of 1
by 6 13 inches long and place them at the base of each post. Place
the bottom stringer so each end rests on a spacer block, then nail
it to the post.
</P>
<P>
   The top stringer should be about 38 inches above the bottom one.
Cut two more spacer blocks 38 inches long and place them at posts
so they rest on the bottom stringers. Place the top stringer on
these blocks and nail it in place. You can remove the support
blocks once both stringers are nailed in place.
</P>
<P>
   The final step in constructing the fence is to nail the pickets
to the stringers.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest part is positioning the pickets so they align
horizontally and so they are spaced evenly apart. This task can be
made easier if you make a spacing jig out of scrap lumber.
</P>
<P>
   The jig consists of only four boards and is relatively easy to
nail together. However, the pieces must be accurately measured and
assembled or else all the pickets will be out of alignment.
</P>
<P>
   Place the jig on the top stringer, then fit the picket in place
in the vertical slot with the top of the picket nestled against the
horizontal guide on the jig.
</P>
<P>
   Face nail the picket to the top stringer with two 7-penny
galvanized nails. Use two more nails to secure the bottom of the
picket to the lower stringer. Pick the jig up and move it along the
stringer to the next position and nail the rest of the pickets.

   Lily Pad Takeover
</P>
<P>
   Q. On my small Virginia farm is an spring-fed pond 80 feet
across. Where once about a fourth of the surface was occupied by
pink and white lily pads, now the entire pond has been taken over,
and the fish are dying. How best to cut back the lilies?
</P>
<P>
   A. Holding your breath and bending over the side of a rowboat to
reach underwater and cut them back will gain you a year or so of,
well, breathing room before they grow back. Because lilies won't
grow in water more than four feet deep, the pond has probably
become silted in, making it shallow enough that they can grow all
across it. Draining and dredging will help by making the pond
deeper. Be sure to check with the state environmental protection
department first _ a spring-fed pond may be classified as a
wetland, and you will need a permit to change it.
</P>
<P>
   Waterlilies also prefer still water, so installing a
recirculating pump to move water will make them less happy while
increasing the oxygen supply for the fish.
</P>
<P>
   Waterlilies and ponds can coexist, however, if you take a few
precautions. Plant them in pots, use the natural or man-made slope
of the pond or sunken platforms to keep the pots no more than four
feet deep. Pull them up every two years to divide and repot them,
cutting off any rhizomes found creeping over the pots' sides,
heading for pond domination.
</P>
<P>
   Antidote for Hemlock Stump
</P>
<P>
   Q. Recently I had a large hemlock tree removed. The stump
remains and I would like some information on how to hasten its
decomposition.
</P>
<P>
   A. The best choice is to have it chipped down to just below the
soil level. At least you won't be stumbling over it while you wait
for nature to continue the rotting process. In four or five years
the remaining roots will rot away. If you want to plant something
right there right away, take a pickax and saw as well as a shovel
when you go out to dig the hole.
</P>
<P>
   There really isn't any practical way to speed up the process.
Years ago you might have poured a combustible chemical into holes
drilled into the stump, lit it, and let it slowly smolder away. No
neighborhood today would welcome days of constant smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Of course you can always take the architectural alternative. If
you don't like a structure, in this case the stump, plant vines.
</P>
<P>
   Indoor Tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have grown tomatoes successfully in pots but they have
always been outside. This summer we put seedlings in my daughter's
very sunny southern exposure window shelf, but inside. The plants
grew and flowered but no fruit. Why?
</P>
<P>
   A. Most likely they are suffering primarily from unrequited
love. While tomato flowers are complete, having both male and
female parts, the pollen still has to get from one place to another
within the flower. Outside, a visiting bee or a light breeze can
move the pollen, but indoors it may not happen unless you give them
a gentle morning shake when the flowers are fully open to help
transfer the pollen.
</P>
<P>
   Your bright southern exposure is a double problem. While it
still doesn't supply enough light for a plant to make the food
necessary for a major production like a crop of tomatoes, it does
heat up the space between window and plant. Tomato pollen is killed
by temperatures above 95 degrees, so even if the pollen found its
way, it might not matter. Only the whiteflies will find the
environment to their satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Take the plants outside _ who knows, there might be enough
summer left to get a few tomatoes. And next year, leave them
outdoors all season, where they belong.
</P>

   What Files to Back Up, And When and How
</P>
<P>
   Q. I understand that backing up files on my Windows 98 computer
is a good thing, but how do I figure out what I need to back up, as
well as when and how to perform the task?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, backing up your valuable files is a very good thing, as
anyone who has suffered from a nasty system crash or hard-drive
failure can tell you. When and how often you back up depends on
your own needs and frequency of computer use. If you have files
that you work on and update every day, you may want to perform the
chore each night. If you do not use your computer so often, or
don't make frequent changes to the documents you use, a weekly or
monthly backup may suit your needs better.
</P>
<P>
   If you can afford it, consider investing in an external hard
drive or a tape drive to back up your system. Buying a drive that
is at least as large as your computer's hard drive will let you
back up your entire system and all its files, a move that is highly
recommended. Backing up by copying data to an extra drive is also
advised because even if your computer's main hard drive dies, your
files are safe on the other device.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy utility programs like Retrospect, by Dantz
(available for Windows or Macintosh), but Windows 98 comes with its
own built-in backup software, called Microsoft Backup. To find it,
go to the Start menu, then Programs and Accessories. Go to System
Tools and select Backup from the list. (If you do not see Backup
listed, odds are that it was not initially installed on your
computer, but you can add it to your system from your Windows 98
CD-ROM.) The Backup program will also let you restore your saved
files to your system in case something becomes corrupted or you
delete a document by accident.
</P>
<P>
   Once you start the program, the Backup Wizard will lead you
through a series of questions. You will be asked if you would like
to back up My Computer (which is just about everything) or just
certain drives, files or folders. The Wizard will ask you if you
want to back up all the files you have selected or just the ones
that have changed since your last backup. You will also be asked
whether you want to store your backup file on your main computer or
on an external device.
</P>
<P>
   The Backup program can also compress your files to save space.
After you give the backup file a name (like ``daily backup''),
click on the Start button in the Backup Wizard's box, and the
process will begin.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I know I can buy software to help fix my system, but are
there any resources within Windows 98 itself that will help me when
things just aren't right?
</P>
<P>
   A. Although it is tucked away, there is a handy suite of
diagnostic and utility programs included with Windows 98, and that
software may be of help when you are trying to sort out problems
with your operating system. To find these applications, go to the
Start menu, then to Programs, Accessories and System Tools. Select
System Information.
</P>
<P>
   The System Information box will give you plenty of details about
your hardware and software, like what kind of processor your
computer has and how much RAM is installed. Under the Tools menu in
this System Information box you will find the programs that can
help you trouble-shoot.

APPLIANCE WITH A PURPOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER H. LEWIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   About half of all American households now have personal
computers, a trend that is astonishing considering that PC's are
expensive, complicated and unreliable, compared with other
household appliances. Conversely, about half of all homes have
managed to resist buying computers until now. That annoys the
Microsoft Corp., which hates the idea of the country being divided
in two. (Microsoft hates the idea of anything being divided in
two.)
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's mission statement calls for a computer _
Windows-based, naturally _ in every home. That sounds like a swell
idea to Compaq, the world's largest maker of Windows-powered PC's.
So earlier this week, Compaq and Microsoft teamed up to introduce
the iPAQ Home Internet Appliance IA-1, a $199 home computer
designed for people who don't like computers.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Compaq prefers not to call it a computer, referring to
it instead as ``the Internet in a box.''
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that to get the iPAQ IA-1 for $199 requires a
three-year commitment to Microsoft's MSN Internet service, which is
$21.95 a month, raising the total cost of the Internet in a Box to
nearly $1,000. If the buyer doesn't sign up for three years of MSN,
this cute little cow pie of a computer costs a ridiculous $599.
Even then, the owner will have to have an MSN account to use it.
But if someone already has an MSN account, there would be no need
to buy the iPAQ. Obviously, Compaq sees its audience as first-time
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, some people may be willing to pay this much for a
device that is so simple to use. Much better computers are
available for less money, but they do not offer the push-button
ease of the iPAQ. Think of the price as a simplicity tax.
</P>
<P>
   The iPAQ Home Internet Appliance IA-1 belongs to a new category
of devices called Internet appliances, which are stripped-down
computers designed to handle e-mail, World Wide Web browsing,
online shopping and a few other simple tasks without the cost or
complexity of a personal computer. Specifically, the iPAQ IA-1 is
the first member of a subspecies of Internet appliances called MSN
Companions. Several other computer makers, including eMachines,
have signed up to make Internet appliances that link directly to
Microsoft's MSN network. Gateway, a Compaq rival, has a similar
alliance with America Online, an MSN rival. The Gateway-AOL
appliance is expected to reach the market later this year, as will
an improved model of the original Internet appliance, the
Netpliance i-Opener.
</P>
<P>
   According to Microsoft, most of the people who do not have
computers say they would like to have access to e-mail and the
Internet. They just don't like computers, which cost too much,
break down too often and are too darned intimidating. (Microsoft
blames the hardware for that, of course, which is almost as amusing
as the $599 price tag for the iPAQ Home Internet Appliance IA-1.)
</P>
<P>
   The role model for information appliances is the television set,
which is relatively cheap and simple to set up, turns on and off
instantly with the touch of a button, rarely breaks down and does
not require mastery of a lot of technical hocus-pocus. The TV set
is not particularly smart, but it does not have to be because all
the information it displays is pulled down from the network.
</P>
<P>
   The iPAQ IA-1 works the same way, sort of. It has no floppy
drive, no hard disk and no CD-ROM drive, all of which are standard
equipment on other Windows-based home PC's. It has a feeble little
brain with 32 megabytes of memory, but it doesn't need much more
because almost all of its consciousness is derived from the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To keep things simple _ and to create a direct link between
Microsoft and your wallet _ the iPaq uses a stripped-down version
of Windows called Windows CE. The only major application on the
system is a generation-old Internet Explorer 4.0 Web browser, a
Microsoft product that automatically steers the user to the MSN
home page.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft calls this software bundle an MSN Companion.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven forbid you should decide that you want to try America
Online or Napster or Quicken or some other infidel software.
Because the iPAQ IA-1 has no local storage drives, the owner cannot
download and store files from the Internet or install other
applications, like games, educational software or personal finance
programs. Nor can the owner accidentally erase or move an obscure
Windows file. ``This makes MSN Companion devices very reliable,''
Microsoft says in a reviewer's guide. It also makes the device a
wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   MSN is actually the best thing about this little box. Although
only a fraction of the size of America Online, MSN offers a broad
array of interesting services, most of which are accessible through
the iPAQ.
</P>
<P>
   The iPAQ Home Internet Appliance IA-1 _ the awkward name
suggests that more, and perhaps cheaper, Compaq home Internet
appliances are in the works _ is a bone-colored, two-piece
contraption that is small enough to fit easily on a kitchen
counter. It's about the size of the average pocketbook. It has an
adjustable 10-inch (measured diagonally) color flat-panel display
screen, which is small even when compared with the screens on
laptop computers. To save costs, the iPAQ uses a passive matrix
screen, which is just barely acceptable for e-mail and Web
browsing.
</P>
<P>
   It has a 56K dial-up modem, a scratchy mono speaker and four USB
ports for attaching optional peripherals like an Epson 740 inkjet
printer (the only model it works with at this time), JBL speakers
and a mouse. The most intriguing feature is a Compact Flash Type 2
memory card slot, which has no use at this point. Presumably Compaq
and Microsoft have grand plans for it.
</P>
<P>
   The wireless keyboard is 13 inches wide and 7 inches deep.
Pressing on a rubber nipple about the size of a nickel controls the
cursor on the iPAQ's display screen if you don't want to use a
mouse. In my tests, the cursor control was clumsy and erratic. On
the bright side, the keyboard has a series of buttons dedicated to
specific tasks, which reduces the need to use the built-in pointing
device.
</P>
<P>
   One task button takes the user to a personal MSN home page,
which can be customized to display local weather and news, a stock
portfolio and other useful information. Another automatically opens
the MSN Hotmail e-mail service, which is set up for the people who
buy iPAQ's. There are buttons dedicated to news (MSNBC), finance
(MSN Money Central) and instant messages (MSN Instant Messaging,
which is not compatible with AOL's much more popular service, but
only because AOL will not allow it). There are also buttons for
online shopping (MSN eShop), searching (MSN Search) _ get the
picture? _ Compaq technical support, printing and tracking down
music files. You can listen to the music, but you can't store it.
</P>
<P>
   Although the personal MSN Web page is fixed as the default home
page, users can go to any Web sites after they are online. There is
also a button for storing favorite Web destinations. Microsoft has
stocked that feature with sites that include maps, weather,
greeting cards, Oprah's Books and Third Age, a Web site designed
for ``first-wave baby boomers.'' Huh?
</P>
<P>
   One day earlier this week, the headlines on Third Age's home
page pointed to rather explicit descriptions of how to improve your
sex life. While I am grateful for Microsoft's thoughtfulness in
including this Web site among the six preloaded favorites, perhaps
that is not the greatest bookmark for a family computer.
</P>
<P>
   The ``instant on'' appeal of the iPAQ IA-1 depends entirely on
your definition of ``instant.'' In my tests, it took almost 60
seconds after the power button was pushed for the home page to
finish loading, and that is much quicker than the startup time for
a standard Windows computer. But if it took 60 seconds to turn on a
TV or get a dial tone, people would riot.

SURFING THE WEB FOR SITES ON THE REAL THING 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL POLLAK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are two excellent reasons to go Web surfing for the real
thing. The first reason is if you live along the Southern
California coast, or in Hawaii, or on the Outer Banks or anywhere
else with wave action and you want to find out whether the surf's
up and the sun's going to stay out.
</P>
<P>
   The other reason is if you live anywhere else, particularly if
you are chained to a desk and wouldn't know a Hobie from a hoagie.
In that case, you may need a surf site even more.
</P>
<P>
   For those whose image of surfing remains fixated on the Beach
Boys and ``Hawaii Five-O,'' it may come as a surprise that the
sport is now a big business. It is all over the Web, and some sites
evoke major advertising and venture capital as much as big kahunas
and woodies.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, the aptly named Swell.com (www.swell.com),
which has acquired or linked to many weather, tournament
information, entertainment and merchandise sites and is promoting
itself as being a kind of one-stop shop for all things surf when it
expands later this summer. (Its slick online promotional video is
worth the look.) One of its notable acquisitions is
Surfline(surfline.swell.com), a forecasting service that provides
surfing and weather information for dozens of spots, including 37
sites in California alone, 4 in Hawaii, 17 in Florida, 20 elsewhere
on the East Coast and 3 from Costa Rica. Surfline says it has more
than 350,000 visitors a month.
</P>
<P>
   There are wonderful Webcams on many of Surfline's beach links,
so you do not have to trust the status reports; just look for
yourself. Moreover, there is something about staring at a live
color shot of the uncharacteristically low swells at the Pipeline
on Oahu's North Shore (a result of La Nina, the page's ``local
knowledge'' section explains) or a view of the three-to-five-foot
surf at Guaruja, Brazil, from Midtown Manhattan that is at least as
hypnotic as gazing into a lava lamp.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawaiian Lifeguard Association has its own site detailing
the lifeguard-protected beaches of Oahu
(www.aloha.com:80/(tilde)lifeguards/hla.html). Besides the great
pictures, there is a lot of advice that is short on surfer lingo
and long on good sense: reminders about sharp coral, waves breaking
on ledges and the need to respect high-surf warnings. There are
separate pages titled Sharks of Hawaii and Dangerous Ocean
Organisms. There are 18 of the latter, including stinging seaweed.
</P>
<P>
   Times have definitely changed. The East Coast Wahine
Championships (www.eastcoastwahines.com), an amateur contest for
East Coast surfing women that began in 1997, was held Aug. 12 and
13 in Wrightsville Beach, N.C., blessed by California-size waves
stirred up by Hurricane Alberto. There were short board (the more
acrobatic type), long board and bodyboard divisions and a novice
division for beginners. You can see photos of some of the
competition on the Southern North Carolina Surf page
(www.sncsurf.com). The U.S. Surfing Federation (www.ussurf.org) and
Eastern Surfing Association (www.surfesa.org) have schedules on the
major amateur events, including the Eastern Surfing Championships
in late September in Avon, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site of the International Surfing Museum in Huntington
Beach, Calif. (www.surfingmuseum.org), provides a nostalgic return
to simple joys. There is a camera box belonging to Bruce Brown,
director of the classic surfing documentary ``The Endless Summer,''
with its top that was painted by LeRoy Neiman on a trip to the
beach. There are pictures of Corky Carroll, world champion in the
1960s, in his prime, and a quote from him today: ``Yes, I still
surf all the time, and no, I still don't have a real job. Let's
hope it never comes to that.'' There are plenty of pictures of Duke
Kahanamoku, the Olympic swimming champion from Hawaii, and his
10-foot redwood board, with which he did more to popularize surfing
than anyone until Hobie Alter, perfecter of the fiberglass board,
and Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's online exhibits include an Irish surfing poster
(County Sligo, 1984) and a surfboard used by the Swiss team (Swiss?
Well, why not?) in an international 1992 championship.
</P>
<P>
   For sheer escapism, it is hard to do better than the Costa Rica
Supersite (www.incostarica.net/docs/surf). Rent a four-wheel drive
to get to the best places, it advises, because ``mud and rivers
will become an important part of your journey, especially during
the rainy season.'' There are plenty of links, including some to
other Costa Rican surfing guides.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a partial description of Matapalo, on the Pacific Coast:
``Best waves are a 15- to 25-minute walk through the forest trails,
where monkeys, toucans, macaws and other tropical wonders can be
spotted.''
</P>
<P>
   With comments like that, who needs pictures?

COSMETICS WEB SITES OFFER SHOPPERS VIRTUAL MAKE-OVERS, BUT PROBLEMS
REMAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: The writer's e-mail address is: Slatalla(AT)nytimes.com.) By
MICHELLE SLATALLA  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although I do not wear makeup, I live with two experts on the
subject. My 9- and 11-year-old daughters are so attuned to the
nuances of cosmetics that they can tell from a distance of 20 paces
if a woman gels her eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does that level of eyebrow maintenance accomplish?'' I
asked, a question that unfortunately focused their attention
directly on my own unplucked visage one day last week.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour, I was at the mall, sitting on one of those high
stools while my daughters applied blush and eye shadow from tester
pots in a quest to determine my ``colors.''
</P>
<P>
   I had to admit that it was a lot of fun, until a sales clerk
approached offering cleanser on a cotton ball and a free
consultation.
</P>
<P>
   One thing led to another, and I lost control of the situation
around the time the clerk announced that I had ``ragged, uneven
patches'' and ``fatty deposits'' that cried out for daily
applications of expensive creams.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I regained my composure in the parking lot 15
minutes later, my face had been replaced by the clerk's idea of ``a
sheer look for everyday,'' and I was clutching a shopping bag full
of makeup. The receipt said $122.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look good,'' lied Zoe, my 11-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   You might think the humiliation of slinking back to return the
stuff the next day (actually, to avoid the clerk I skulked to
another Bloomingdale's in a different town) would have jettisoned
further experimentation. But it only whetted my appetite: I had
seen my future and it included eyeliner.
</P>
<P>
   So when I heard about a growing number of Internet sites where
shoppers can perform virtual make-overs on themselves, I rushed
over to test three, eMakeover.com, MakeoverStudio.com and
EZface.com.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that you take a digital photo of your face, send it
to the site and then point and click on different combinations of
products to apply them to the image. You can then see what goes
together and buy products you want online.
</P>
<P>
   I tried blond hair (a mistake) at eMakeover and yellow eye
shadow (ditto) at EZface. Then I clicked a button to clean it all
off. I could determine my colors without enduring a sales clerk's
sales pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The sites are still in development. Shoppers can purchase a
limited selection of beauty products at two of them, eMakeover.com
and MakeoverStudio.com.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, the EZface make-over tool (which is being tested, so
you can play with it but not purchase anything) will be available
at a jewelry site, Kirabo.com, where shoppers will be able to click
on earrings and necklaces to see how the gems look on them.
</P>
<P>
   That was so much fun that I thought I might be witnessing the
emergence of tools that would magically erase at least one of the
problems that have plagued the crowded online cosmetics market in
recent months and prompted mergers and buyouts of such high-profile
sites as Beauty.com and Gloss.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contenders in this market have been like pigeons scraping
for bread crumbs in a crowded piazza,'' said Evie Black Dykema, a
senior online retail analyst at Forrester Research.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a projected increase in Web sales, to $900 million by
2004 from $90 million last year, only 2 percent of nonmedication
health and beauty aids will be sold online, Dykema said.
</P>
<P>
   Many shoppers are reluctant to buy makeup they cannot test
before buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see how something looks truly on your own face, and how
it's blended with your own skin tone and your hair style and the
color of your eyes, is a major breakthrough,'' said Gary Savage,
EZface.com's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest hurdle? Getting the digital photo online. Only 8
percent of households in the United States have a digital camera or
a scanner, so the make-over tools' distribution is limited. (There
are other options: You can take a regular roll of film to a Kodak
PhotoNet outlet and then get access to the digitized photos through
AOL's ``You've Got Pictures'' service or take a printed photo to a
print shop to have it put onto a disk.)
</P>
<P>
   Even for a person like me, living in a household with at least a
half-dozen digital cameras lying around and a spouse who knows how
to use them, the project was an ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   I had to sit around playing solitaire on the computer for nearly
two hours as my husband fiddled with lighting, hunted for the
camera cord, persuaded his computer to recognize a smart card
reader, persuaded the smart card reader to recognize the digital
image, fiddled with the editing software to create a JPEG file and
transferred the image from his computer to mine through a home
network.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I was exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   I then had to send the image by e-mail to both EZface.com and
MakeoverStudio.com so their software could reproduce my features
and my skin tone to ensure a realistic application of makeup.
</P>
<P>
   I had to wait for the photos to be processed. At EZface.com,
that took a couple of days, but at MakeoverStudio.com, my photo was
still ``in process'' after six days (so I tested that site's
make-over tool on digital images of models on the site).
</P>
<P>
   I also uploaded my digital image to eMakeover.com, which took
only a few minutes. The problem there, however, was that I had to
use the cursor to mark outlines of my own features on the digital
image so the site would know where to apply color. In the end, my
lips looked kind of crooked.
</P>
<P>
   Emakeover.com offered dozens of choices of lipstick colors from
Avon to test. I saved the ones I liked _ twig, rose marble and
shell _ in an online shopping basket. Afterward, eMakeover.com
connected me to Avon.com's site to complete the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Transmitting color over the Internet to shoppers with
idiosyncratic computer systems running various operating systems
and different browsers is a tricky business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The colors are monitor-dependent, but, over all, monitors are
getting better and better,'' said Chrissie Kremer, a co-founder of
Makeover Networks, which owns MakeoverStudio.com. ``People with
modern-day equipment are getting really good representation.''
</P>
<P>
   I had been considering the Avon lipstick rose marble, which
seemed to really bring out my eyes, when Ella, my 9-year-old,
peered over my shoulder at the computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know something?'' she said. ``You look really good without
makeup.''

   THE GUILDED RAGE
</P>
<P>
   Q: The unions that represent actors in television commercials
are on strike. I work at a recording studio, not party to the
strike, that has been hired for sessions using nonunion actors.
This makes me squeamish, to say the least. I have friends on both
sides of the conflict, including many producers from small ad
agencies. I could refuse to participate in nonunion sessions, thus
alienating my boss. I could call the union and it would picket my
studio, but that could imperil the livelihood of my boss and my
producer friends. Or I could do nothing. What do you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   _ Brian Hallas, Brooklyn, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A: Considering your convictions, you would do better to join an
effort against nonunion actors at all independent recording
studios, not just your own. That's the call you should make to the
union _ to ask how you can participate. That beats the alternatives
you have suggested. Eschewing nonunion sessions would jeopardize
your job but benefit no one; you would be replaced, and the
sessions would continue. Passivity is no better: it would allow the
strike to go on and on, something deleterious to the union actors,
the small producers, your employer and your conscience. Brice
Peyre, a spokesman for the Screen Actors Guild, one of the striking
unions (the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists is
the other), thinks you should blow the whistle _ softly. ``Quietly
tip off SAG and/or AFTRA so that their members can arrange to
picket the studio in advance and attempt to talk the actor out of
scabbing against the union,'' he says. I don't agree. Calling in
the pickets would be a selective action taken against a single
company _ yours. Worse still, you would be using privileged
information to harm your own boss. And there is something unseemly
in creeping around behind his back. That an action must be
undertaken in secret is sometimes a clue to its dubious nature, as
we also see in the nonunion actors' desire to remain unidentified.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Company policy allows me a certain number of vacation weeks
per year. My manager, in an effort to be generous (or liked),
offered me an extra week _ but I am not to mark it on my time
sheet. Do I take his offer, since he indulges in an extra week
himself, or follow company policy?
</P>
<P>
   _ Anonymous
</P>
<P>
   A: You ought not accept the extra vacation week unless your
manager can offer it without the need for false paperwork. A
manager should have the maximum flexibility to reward his
employees, but when his reward demands deceit, it's not
flexibility; it's fraud. Given your company's policy, an extra week
is no more his to give than is that nice Xerox machine down in the
copy room. Just because your manager takes an extra week himself,
deceiving his own boss, does not make the practice more legitimate
for you. As my mother always said, if your manager jumped off the
roof or engineered some kind of complicated kickback scheme, would
you jump off the roof or engineer some kind of complicated kickback
scheme? You may well deserve that vacation, but you should not lie
on your time sheet to get it.

THE WEB HELPS MILITARY 'BRATS' FIND LONG-LOST FRIENDS
</HEADLINE>
  By MINDY SINK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carol Passar lived in Pennsylvania for only a year, when she was
13, but she left behind her best friend when the military moved her
family to yet another Army base in another part of the country.
Nearly 40 years later she was able to find her long-lost friend
through an online registry for military ``brats'' like herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw her name there in the registry list, and I said, `That's
Jeanie!'' Passar recalled. ``And wonder of all wonders, she
remembered me, too.''
</P>
<P>
   After exchanging a few e-mail messages, the two women met for
coffee earlier this year. ``I recognized her right away,'' Passar
said with a laugh. ``Her hair was grayer, but all these years later
she had the same fun personality that makes her fun to know.''
</P>
<P>
   The site Passar used, the Military Brats Registry
(www.military-brats.com), is one of a handful of places where
people who grew up in military families can try to find long-lost
acquaintances from childhoods that had them moving often, around
the country and the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're 13 years old, you don't really write a lot of
letters,'' Passar said, ``and these were the days before e-mail,
and you couldn't just zap somebody a message around the world. When
you travel around all the time, you can't grow attached to a place.
You can only become attached to people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Military Brats Registry is free to use and contains more
than 43,000 names, with about 15 to 20 names added daily. It links
to another site, Military Brats Online
(www.lynxu.com/brats/index.html), that posts reunion messages and
reminiscences on military base life.
</P>
<P>
   The registry was started by Marc Curtis of Redlands, Calif.,
whose father was an Army sergeant stationed at posts including
Yokohama in Japan; Fort Bliss, Texas; and posts throughout
California when Marc was growing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Military bratdom doesn't leave your system,'' Curtis, now 49,
said. ``There's a whole mind-set that you're brought up with. For
me, after about 25 years, it started to become very important to
find friends I grew up with on military bases.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the missing links in Curtis' life were friends from his
elementary school in Texas, and on his site there is a page of
photographs from his fourth grade class. Of the 30 students in the
class, Curtis has found 12 and met with 4 of them. ``After 39
years, almost nothing has changed,'' he said. ``I started the
registry mostly as a way to find my own friends, and now wanting to
help others find theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis said the site ``pays for itself'' through a little
advertising and the sale of some items on the site.
</P>
<P>
   The site is organized by names _ maiden names for married women
_ and high school graduation dates. Once registered, a person can
scroll through the site to look for a familiar name or people from
a particular graduation year. Contact can be made via e-mail, which
is routed through the site rather than directly to the individual
for privacy reasons.
</P>
<P>
   `` After I registered a couple of months ago, I kept checking my
e-mail every week,'' said Amy Brown, 26, a schoolteacher in
Plymouth, Mass., ``and I got a couple from people that I knew in
high school in Scotland, but no really close friends. Then last
week I got a call from a good friend who had seen my name on the
registry and couldn't wait to e-mail. She had found out what town I
lived in and called information.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said she and her newfound old friend are now on a crusade
to find more alumni from the Holy Loch, Scotland, schools for a
reunion next year.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons people like Brown have difficulty tracking
down old classmates is that military-run base schools are often
prevented by privacy laws from providing alumni information, and
some international schools have closed, making their records
essentially inaccessible.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of individual sites for such schools, where
alumni can look for old friends and teachers, many of which are
listed on Military Brats Online. There is also the Canadian
Military Brat List (www.hub.org/brat(underscore)web), as well as a
site for those who grew up in foreign countries while their parents
worked as missionaries, diplomats or business executives
(www.tckworld.com). This site includes Schools Without Walls, lists
of military-base or overseas schools that have closed, grouped by
continent.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Defense Education Activity site
(www.odedodea.edu/alumni) has links to sites for many of the more
than 220 schools run by the department in this country and abroad.
The American Overseas Schools Historical Society
(aoshs.wichita.edu) is building an archive of the educational
history and memorabilia of an estimated four million American
children, and it also provides links to brats registries and
related sties.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are many stories of friendships _ and at least
one romance _ rekindled through the brats registries, sometimes
things just don't work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found my best friend from the second grade who I knew in
Georgia,'' Passar said. ``She didn't remember me at all, though.''

THERE'S MORE THAN FAST FOOD BETWEEN HERE AND SANTA FE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BEVERLY BUNDY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't have to pull a ``Thelma &AMP; Louise'' to justify a road
trip. Being more of the Kathy Bates persuasion myself (''I'm older
and I have better insurance''), I've taken to the road, headed west
on Interstate 30, in search of American food.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the Route 66 food of our childhoods: pecan logs at
Stuckey's and root beer floats at A&AMP;W. Nor is it our children's
road food: chicken and dumplings at Cracker Barrel or nuked
burritos from the Exxon station. This is real American food that is
doing just fine, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   So for the next few weeks, you'll be following along on an
Excellent Adventure, a sampler of what we're eating from Texas to
New Mexico to Nevada to California and back again.
</P>
<P>
   Cornudas Cafe &AMP; Gift Shop, U.S. 180 between Dell City and El
Paso, (915) 964-2409:
</P>
<P>
   West of Pecos is a little dot on the map that has been pumping
gas since the 1920s. It took tough folks to settle this dry, flat
land, and it appears that their descendants are just as tough.
</P>
<P>
   When I first called the Cornudas Cafe to find out if they were
open on Sundays, the woman who answered the phone said, ``Who is
this?'' A few weeks later I called to get the exact street address
and the man who answered the phone said, ``Who is this?'' You can't
be too careful.
</P>
<P>
   And the greeting isn't too much friendlier when you pull up to
the RV park/gas station/home of the $5 blanket/restaurant. The
waitress presents a menu written on a brown paper lunch sack and
impatiently taps her pen. ``What's good?'' ``Everything,'' she
says, tapping away.
</P>
<P>
   Well, they may not be friendly, but they know how to cook. The
tacos, indeed, were wonderful _ freshly fried flour tortillas were
stuffed with coarse hamburger pumped with chili powder. The beans
on the side were served in their broth and punctuated with onions _
not the refrieds we more often see in our neck of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let the door hit you on your way out, but do come back for
the burgers.
</P>
<P>
   Owl Bar Cafe &AMP; Steakhouse, U.S. 380, San Antonio, N.M., (505)
835-9946:
</P>
<P>
   We may think we take our chili seriously in Texas, but we're
only pretenders to the throne. It's the New Mexicans who are kings
of the mesa when it comes to chili.
</P>
<P>
   So to claim that San Antonio is home to New Mexico's most famous
green chili cheeseburger takes more than bravado.
</P>
<P>
   The burger is small by Texas standards, but what it lacks in
substance it makes up for in style. The patty is topped with a
slice of American cheese and finished with a spoonful from the
ever-bubbling caldron of green-chile chili.
</P>
<P>
   The mix of clientele is testament to the burger's renown. A
lopsided sign is pinned up behind the bar _ Sale to Intoxicated
Persons Prohibited _ but the attached Kappa Sigma sticker belies
the sign's effectiveness. The house wine appears to be the box of
Franzio white zinfandel on the shelf behind the bar. Yet a few
women of a certain age with pressed Bermudas, Marge Simpson hair
and straw bags politely waved at the help as they left the dark bar
for the blazing summer sun outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Mariscos La Playa Restaurant, 537 Cordova Road, Santa Fe, N.M.,
(505) 982-2790
</P>
<P>
   You'd think that Santa Feans would do better with Spanish than
they do. However, this local favorite is referred to as Mariscos by
one and all. Mariscos, those of us who did the homework our
sophomore year know, means seafood _ an odd name for a restaurant.
Sort of like saying, ``Hey, let's go to Hamburgers for lunch,''
when what we mean is, ``Let's go to Kincaid's.'' But if you ask for
directions, don't say La Playa _ no one calls the restaurant that.
And since everyone in Santa Fe is rich, you don't want to look poor
and dumb.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping in after a workday _ some people in Santa Fe do work,
polishing crystals and throwing pots _ we found it packed with
locals. And for good reason.
</P>
<P>
   The seafood is squeaky fresh and beautifully served without a
soupcon of pretension. We had a yen for oysters, but since August
doesn't have an ``R,'' we were a touch leery. But the T-shirted
waiter was at the top of his game, and when we asked the home port
of that evening's oysters, he said ``Seattle.'' A wonderful detail
at a restaurant that tops out at $30 for a meal for two.
</P>
<P>
   The oysters were pristine and so plump that we couldn't finish
the dozen. Another winner was raw shrimp marinated in lemon juice _
shells and all. Ringed with cucumber slices that had been peeled
and scored, the Mexican take on sushi was just the thing for a hot
summer night.
</P>
<P>
   Mariscos (there I go) also serves a terrific guacamole along
with its pico de gallo. The mashed avocados are blended with some
``crema'' and kicked up with some of the pico de gallo, yielding a
salsa with the taste of avocados but the consistency of green
goddess dressing. It's a definite twist to try at home.
</P>
<P>
   Next week _ a righteous breakfast in Grants, N.M., and Thai to
die for in Las Vegas.

GWYNETH SINGETH; WILL PEOPLE BUYETH?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Actors who want to be singers are, most often, like bears who
have been trained to juggle while hopping on one foot.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that they juggle and hop particularly well, it's that
they do it at all.
</P>
<P>
   Not that we're trying to denigrate the efforts of actress
Gwyneth Paltrow, whose duet with Huey Lewis on the old Smokey
Robinson hit ``Cruisin''' is released to radio this week.
``Cruisin''' is one of three tunes Paltrow recorded for the
soundtrack to the film ``Duets'' (which hits theaters Sept. 15),
and it's a pop/R&AMP;B classic.
</P>
<P>
   But come on _ the track record of movie stars becoming singers
is pretty poor, and Paltrow's efforts won't change that perception.
As a singer, she is a pretty good actress, although she fares
better than some other actors who attempted crossover success.
Remember:
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Willis as bluesman: Unlistenable.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Segal as rocker: Weak.
</P>
<P>
   John Travolta as pop star: Horrid.
</P>
<P>
   Don Johnson as ... well ... whatever that was he was trying to
do: Gag.
</P>
<P>
   We could go on, but why prolong the pain? Point is, pop-culture
history is littered with horrific examples of actors thinking they
could sing and inflicting that belief on innocent people.
</P>
<P>
   We don't expect them to be good _ because most of the evidence
says they won't be _ but we listen anyway, because of who they are.
</P>
<P>
   We're pleased to report that ``Cruisin''' is ``not awful.''
Paltrow's voice is thin and one-dimensional; it combines with
Lewis' to fashion a bland, white-bread, inoffensive stab at a soft,
sweet pop/soul classic without ever suggesting that Paltrow could
go the Jennifer Lopez route and have a successful solo career.
Which means that, considering its competition in the
actor-goes-singer pantheon, it's a raging success.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, in fact, has been thicker than most with
actor-turned-singer shenanigans. Witness Russell Crowe taking his
band, 30 Odd Foot of Grunt, to Stubb's Bar-B-Q in Austin for three
nights. Word is that TOFOG couldn't have gotten arrested in Austin
had Crowe not been the lead singer.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Keanu Reeves, whose band Dogstar has a new CD,
``Happy Ending,'' which has spawned a semihit with ``Cornerstore.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, ``Cornerstore'' has found a home at Fort Worth-Dallas
station KKMR/93.3 FM, according to program director Scott Strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play the Dogstar every day, more than once,'' Strong says.
``We played it once to see the reaction, and it was tremendous.
It's really a good-sounding, adult song that connects with the
listener _ and he's hot. He's got the new movie, and people are
buying ``The Matrix'' like crazy on DVD.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong remembers seeing Woody Harrelson at a small St. Louis
club years ago, when the ``Cheers'' star was touring with a
'50s/'60s party-rock band. He was, Strong says, ``really bad,''
but, hey, he drew a crowd, just as Crowe is doing this month in
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of our listeners went to see Crowe and they said
mainly it was bad _ and they didn't care whatsoever,'' he says.
``It was Russell Crowe, he looked great _ it was a campy evening of
drinking beer and being part of something. It's a guilty
pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   But for those who would like to hear an actor successfully take
a stab at music, you almost have to go back to the late '50s and
the works of the late, great Robert Mitchum. Mitchum's musical
career is best remembered for ``The Ballad of Thunder Road,'' a
smallish pop hit in 1958. But it was his ``Calypso ... Is Like So _
'' LP that puts him head and shoulders among almost any other
thespian who dove into music.
</P>
<P>
   Assured, campy and often quite funny, ``Calypso'' _ rereleased
on CD in 1995 by Scamp Records _ is a kitsch/lounge/Latin classic,
a great party CD, and all the proof we need that actors need not
make fools of themselves when they step up to the michrophone.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they often do.
</P>

FOR SOME, MATRIMONIAL SITES BOTH HONOR AND SUBVERT TRADITION 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Mass., Wis., Ohio, Va.)  By REENA JANA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harsha Kumar, a 29-year-old technology officer for an e-commerce
company in Westborough, Mass., wanted to find a wife. And Kumar,
who was born in India and educated in the United States, wanted to
begin his search in a way that blended both Old and New World
sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I wanted to marry an Indian or Indian-American woman,
but arranged marriage seemed unnatural to me,'' Kumar said.
``Meeting someone online seemed more natural to me, maybe because I
work in e-commerce and am on the Internet and using e-mail a lot
already.''
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, Kumar signed up with Internet Matrimonials
(matrimonials.com), a service for people of South Asian heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, many South Asians have arranged marriages through
relatives or ``marriage bureaus,'' paid matchmakers sometimes
called bride brokers. In addition, publications like India Abroad
and The Times of India have carried classified ads, usually placed
by parents, looking for serious prospective brides and grooms. But
in the last few years, matrimonial Web sites have offered an
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Matrimonials says that it receives nearly 40,000 visits
a month. The site charges customers $30 each to advertise
themselves to potential spouses by indicating their religion,
occupation, cultural background and location.
</P>
<P>
   Through Internet Matrimonials, Kumar began sending e-mail to a
law student in Bombay named Hema Sastry twice a day, once in the
morning and once at night. They found that beyond having compatible
``biodata'' _ the term used for the resume-like summaries used in
each matrimonial ad for each person's caste, education and physical
attributes _ they also shared an interest in Indian music.
</P>
<P>
   They soon exchanged photographs by mail. In February 1999, Kumar
decided to make the trip to India to meet Sastry in person. They
became engaged and in December 1999 were married in India. Kumar's
wife then moved to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people might think it's crazy that we began our
relationship via e-mail,'' Kumar said. ``But I think we
communicated more than some people who date one another once a
week. We probably even communicated more than we do now, living in
the same house as a husband and wife who get too busy caught up
with work and errands.''
</P>
<P>
   Matrimonial Web sites seem to strike a compromise between
ancient South Asian social traditions and the contemporary
attitudes of many Indian- and Pakistani-Americans by cutting out
the intermediary of arranged marriages: the family. Just as online
trading is starting to cut out the middleman in the investing
business, the Web is being used to help arrange marriages without
relatives or marriage bureaus. The sites can be particularly useful
for South Asians abroad; in 1998 alone, 36,500 Indians and 13,100
Pakistanis moved to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Kumar said that his parents had not been put off by his lack of
interest in a traditional arranged marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got what they wanted and I got what I wanted, and the
match was even better, I think, than either an arranged marriage or
a `love marriage,''' Kumar said, using the term for marriages that
result from dating. Love marriages are still looked down upon by
some conservative South Asian families, both in this country and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Kumar's experience was so positive that he recommended the
Internet Matrimonials site to his sister, Reshma, who also lives in
the United States. She met her husband through the same service.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular of the hundreds of matrimonial sites on the Web
include Internet Matrimonials, A1 Matrimonials (www.a1im.com),
IndianMarriages (www.indianmarriages.com) and Suitable Match
(www.suitablematch.com). Most sites offer some free services, like
letting people search the bride and groom databases, and allow
users to post photos and descriptive paragraphs about themselves,
but for prospective marriage partners only.
</P>
<P>
   A1 Matrimonials explicitly states that ``no dating ads will be
allowed.''
</P>
<P>
   IndianMarriages invites individuals and parents as well as
marriage bureaus to log on. The site offers simple, advanced and
keyword searches. Users enter or search for information in fields
like ``age'' and ``caste,'' but they can also search for more
detailed information like ``wears turban.'' A ``deluxe'' paid
account allows users to use e-mail to get in contact with those
whose ads are posted. People can peruse the database free.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage sites cater to a technologically sophisticated
population. According to Forrester Research, 69 percent of
Asian-American households are online, compared with 43 percent of
the general population.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we're helping Indians and Indian-Americans help
qualify or reject potential mates faster than ever before,'' said
Nahrain Bhatia, who founded Suitable Match, a site with 10,000
registered members. He came up with the idea for the site after he
realized that his American-born daughters were of marriageable age
and that he was not sure where they might find Indian-American
husbands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a real transition occurring in the way people
of Indian descent find their spouses,'' Bhatia said. ``They are
generally busy professionals. They need the process to become more
efficient and more effective. Plus, most of the Indian-Americans
who are online are young and educated _ quite an attractive pool of
marriage candidates.''

site, believes that online services can streamline the marriage
process. Manglani's own parents spent three years finding a mate
for him. When they finally found her through a newspaper ad, it
took six months for the families to arrange to introduce the future
bride and groom to each other in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can reduce a six-month process to six days, think of how
much easier we can make finding a mate,'' Manglani said. ``I mean,
a successful marriage is all about sheer luck. Wouldn't it be
better to be up front about whether or not a bride or groom won't
work as quickly as possible? Then our clients could move on and
just get that much closer to finding the right person, get married
and get on with their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Achla Sagal, 30, a second-generation Indian-American lawyer in
Dayton, Ohio, said she had considered an arranged marriage, but
after seven years of her parents' hunting in vain for her ideal
groom, she grew frustrated. Sagal said she surfed the Web until she
found two free sites, A1 Matrimonials and IndianMarriages, and
placed ads with them. Sagal said her parents were eager to see
their daughter married and supported her online quest for a
husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured that without parental buffers, I might be able to
more easily find an Indian-American who genuinely wanted to get
married to another Indian-American,'' Sagal said. She had tired of
offline meetings with marriage candidates who, after formal
introductions with both sets of parents and other relatives in the
same room, would admit that they were there only out of obligation
to their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online, the contact between me and a potential groom is much
more direct,'' said Sagal, who has yet to find a groom. She has had
responses from more than 25 potential grooms and has corresponded
with 10.
</P>
<P>
   The online options for finding a mate might seem modern, but
they represent an acceptance of the prejudices of previous
generations. Looking for a spouse through such strict criteria as
caste or subcaste, post-graduate degrees, or even lightness of
complexion (common fields on most matrimonial sites) echoes the
strict categories that traditional South Asian parents and marriage
bureaus have used for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, I feel like using online matrimonial sites is
hypocritical,'' said Koki Jhumra, a 22-year-old Pakistani-American
who works as a Web site developer in Cambridge, Mass. ``Basically
you're engaging in a meat hunt, like you would in a bar, even
though that's what you're theoretically trying to avoid.'' Jhumra
said she had tried a matrimonial site and had been disappointed
when a potential mate she met online decided that she was too
young.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's funny,'' Jhumra said, ``because at the same time
you're trying to meet people online by prescreening them by the
same biases _ like someone's age, education, social status or
wealth _ used by your parents and marriage bureaus alike, rather
than finding out if you have things in common and communicate
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirin Narayan, a professor of anthropology and languages and
cultures of Asia at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, said
that South Asian matrimonial Web sites could catch on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marriages to an appropriate person of the right religion,
region, caste, subcaste and so on used to be arranged through the
intermediaries of elders and matchmakers who were linked in local
networks,'' Narayan said. ``In more impersonal settings, like
cities, matrimonial advertising through newspapers could forge new
links and expand the range of available prospects beyond existing
networks.''
</P>
<P>
   That view was echoed by Anne Monius, an assistant professor at
the Center for South Asian Studies at the University of Virginia
who lectures on arranged marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indian parents who are immigrants might not have the network
in the States necessary to arrange a marriage easily,'' she said.
``These Web sites can help because they offer a controlled
environment, in terms of a somewhat screened community.''
</P>
<P>
   Even operators of reputable marriage bureaus are turning to the
Web to reach unattached South Asians and South Asian-Americans.
Falguni Mehta, who has run a marriage bureau that bears her name in
Bombay for more than 12 years and arranged more than 5,000
marriages, started her own Web site (www.falgunimehta.com) in 1997.
She said that since she had gone online, she had arranged five to
seven marriages a month through the Web. Most of her clients have
been Indian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Mehta posts information only on clients whose backgrounds she
has checked. ``I make the first inquiry about a bride or groom's
background,'' Mehta said, ``and I've built up a trustworthy
reputation with a traditional marriage bureau over the years. But
on these other sites, people can manipulate the truth quite easily,
and there is no one who can monitor that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his parents weren't pressuring him to marry, Manish
Vij, the 27-year-old founder and vice president for marketing at
Pointera, a Silicon Valley company, posted an advertisement with
Internet Matrimonials out of curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   Vij said he noticed that certain terms kept surfacing in the
advertisements placed by divorced women. ``Issueless divorce,'' he
deduced, stands for ``no children,'' while ``innocently divorced''
means ``still a virgin.'' Both terms can easily be searched for on
most sites.
</P>
<P>
   Vij said he would prefer meeting his wife offline. ``I'd rather
feel chemistry,'' he said, ``which one might experience meeting a
woman not only at a party, but also in an arranged meeting set up
by relatives.''

BICYCLE COMPUTERS STILL COUNT MILEAGE, BUT HEART RATE AND IDEAL
PACE, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   By GLENN FLEISHMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you set out for a leisurely country bike ride, knowing the
distance you've traversed to the hundredth of a mile probably isn't
your first thought.
</P>
<P>
   And you might not want to know how much your heart rate
increased during the 10 minutes you spent climbing a hill.
</P>
<P>
   But dedicated cyclists can be obsessive about their performance.
And the only way to get an accurate reading on how fast the bike is
going or how hard the rider is working is to use a bicycle
computer.
</P>
<P>
   The newest computers (sometimes called ``cyclocomputers'' by
manufacturers and stores) can do more than monitor speed and
distance: the most sophisticated can also count the rider's heart
rate and determine elevation.
</P>
<P>
   These measurements, taken together, offer a series of snapshots
of a ride.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of measuring how far and fast a bicycle travels
emerged alongside the modern bicycle in the 1860s. Russell Mamone,
a past editor of The Wheelmen _ a publication of an organization of
the same name that is devoted to bicycle history _ said that the
earliest ``cyclometers'' had been attached inside front wheel hubs,
to the underside of pedals or to wheels, where they counted off
rotations by striking pins against the wheel or spokes. None of
them could be read without dismounting from the bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in those days were very interested in how far they
traveled,'' Mamone said. ``You couldn't really tell how far it was
from Washington to Fredericksburg, Va. To record mileage
accurately, they would use these cyclometer records.''
</P>
<P>
   Modern bike computers have not strayed too far from the basics.
They employ a magnet attached to a front wheel spoke to signal
rotations. A matching magnetic sensor fits on one of the blades of
the bike's front fork. The magnet and sensor have to be carefully
placed so the gap is small enough to trigger the sensor, but big
enough to keep the two from knocking together.
</P>
<P>
   Bicycle computers can also calculate cadence _ the pedaling
rhythm, measured in rotations per minute _ by mounting sensors on
the back of the bike to track rotations of the bicycle crank, the
pedals' pivot point and the place where the gears are mounted. Many
biking experts recommend a regular cadence for better performance
and exercise value. While it can be hard to gauge revolutions per
minute mentally, a bike computer can provide sound and visual cues.
</P>
<P>
   When a magnetic sensor is used to determine speed or cadence
(some can measure both), the magnet closes a mechanical switch in
the sensor each time it rushes by, sending a pulse to the bike
computer. That connection can be through a wire run from the sensor
to the computer, mounted on the handlebars, or a low-power
transmitter on the sensor can send a signal wirelessly. Wireless
transmission might be the only option for mountain bikes because
the range of free motion makes it difficult to thread a wire safely
from the fork to the handlebars.
</P>
<P>
   Before a bike computer can translate the pulses arriving from a
sensor into a read-out of miles or kilometers per hour, the
computer has to be programmed with the wheel's circumference so it
can calculate both speed and distance. For cadence, the sprocket
size of each gear has to be entered as well.
</P>
<P>
   Bike computers come with settings for standard wheel sizes. But
those generally include only a few combinations, so many riders
have to make their own calculations. (Measuring the wheel's
circumference is easily done by rolling the wheel along a tape
measure on the floor.) Some computers can store multiple wheel
sizes so adjustments can be made when a rider changes bikes or
swaps wheels on the same bike.
</P>
<P>
   With the wheel size in mind, the bike computer can translate the
number of rotations into a speed calculation. It counts the number
of rotations and multiplies that by the distance traveled with each
rotation. Most bike computers can store the distance traveled in
the current ride and the total number of miles on the bike, as well
as the current, minimum and maximum speeds. Some can also monitor
how much time is left (distance or time) in a programmed ride, or
how close the rider is to an ideal pedaling pace.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most advanced bike computers, the SpeedZone P.Brain
from Specialized Bicycles, receives information about the rider's
heart rate from a wireless heart monitor strap, and it also has an
altimeter. The P.Brain can record five measurements _ speed, time,
current distance, elevation and heart rate _ at intervals that vary
from every 10 seconds to every minute. That information can be
uploaded into a desktop computer through a serial port so it can be
analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   A compact, battery-operated, wireless computer that can perform
a number of functions might seem like a far cry from its mechanical
ancestor, but it's really just a refinement.

</P>
<P>
   ``King David: The Real Life of the Man Who Ruled Israel'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   by Jonathan Kirsch &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ballantine Books &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Biblical commentator Jonathan Kirsch sorts David out for us.
</P>
<P>
   He explains that Chronicles was intended to correct the
contradictions in Samuel. He makes it clear that David's selection
as king of Israel was rigged by humans and not necessarily ordained
of God. He clears up the problem of how David the slingshot champ
could have been unknown to King Saul, even though David the master
musician was a court fixture. (They were two different people!)
</P>
<P>
   Kirsch's work is immensely interesting, but it's possible that
only serious Bible scholars are ready for all this. Kirsch claims
David might not have slain Goliath; it's possible it was another
man.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not all. Kirsch maintains it's likely that David was
bisexual, since men as well as women were so strongly attracted to
him, and his affection for Jonathan was so celebrated.
</P>
<P>
   The book also has at times a humorous bent, as in the passages
about Saul, who preceded David on the throne but who began his
career ignominiously, getting lost while searching for his father's
stray animals.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone will be able to accept Kirsch's premise that all
the Hebrew Bible _ that's the Old Testament to some people _ was
written to prepare us for and to celebrate the greatness of David.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, ``King David'' is certain to cause a stir. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Drew Dawson, program director of KHVN/970 AM and a man who knows
more about gospel than I ever will, recommended I listen to this
CD, Ramsey's debut.
</P>
<P>
   You go, Drew. The 10 songs here are testament to an important
new voice in contemporary gospel, a woman whose vocal power will
immediately remind one of a young Whitney Houston _ and yes, she's
that good.
</P>
<P>
   Cut in a half-dozen studios (from Oklahoma to North Carolina to
Chicago) and the product of six songwriters (besides Ramsey) and
seven producers, the CD looks, on paper, like a cut-and-paste
effort.
</P>
<P>
   And to be sure, there are a few tracks _ such as the second
song, ``Heaven'' _ that are gussied up a bit too much. But this is
a minor quibble when set against the CD's overall excellence.
Ramsey's voice is equally adept at handling the easygoing lope of
``Tell It'' and the jazz-tinged balladry of ``Unconditional Love.''
Her voice is a powerful, supple instrument, and although the
backing tracks can get a tad too glossy, the vocal arrangements are
beautiful: Listen to how Ramsey works against the backing vocals on
``Shout About.''
</P>
<P>
   This CD has a strong local connection. Four of the tracks were
written and arranged by Carnell Murrell, the Dallas-based
singer/songwriter/keyboardist who was a member (along with Kirk
Franklin) of the DFW Mass Choir in its early glory days. Murrell,
who has released several solo CDs, is the CD's second star. He
penned ``Don't Be Weary,'' a duet with Ramsey, one of the CD's best
moments. &QL;

ONLY ONE HEARTBEAT AWAY &HT;    By HELEN THOMAS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Suddenly the role of the vice president in the
November election has gotten everyone's attention.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the American electoral system has this odd quirk:
It empowers one man to pick a possible future U.S. president. The
presidential candidate doesn't ask the American voters or the
electoral college when he _ or, she (someday) _ selects a running
mate who may become president as a result of the death or removal
of the president. That's the way the system works and no one has
thought of a better way.
</P>
<P>
   Vice presidential succession isn't a far-fetched prospect. Since
I've been reporting on the Washington scene, three vice presidents
have become president through the succession process: Harry Truman
in 1945 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt suffered a fatal
stroke; Lyndon B. Johnson in 1963 when John F. Kennedy was
assassinated; and Gerald R. Ford in 1974 when Richard Nixon was
forced to resign as a result of the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it's startling that both Vice President Al Gore and
Texas Gov. George W. Bush picked their running mates for defensive
political reasons _ not necessarily because Gore and Bush thought
their vice presidential nominees would make the best presidents if
the need arose.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's pick of Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut apparently
was based on the senator's biggest claim to fame _ his withering
denunciation of President Clinton in 1998 when he branded his
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky as ``immoral
and harmful`` to the nation's children. With Lieberman at his side,
Gore hopes to blunt the Republican litany that Bush would restore
``dignity and honor, '' and oh, yes, ``decency'' to the Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
   So Lieberman, the stern moralist, joins the ticket as the voice
of righteousness, even though he and Gore have parted company in
the past on such issues as school vouchers and privatizing Social
Security. Lately, Lieberman has had a change of heart on school
vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, on the other hand, a johnny-come-lately in national
politics, was looking for ``gravitas'' in his running mate to
counter the perception that he lacks experience in domestic or
foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   So he chooses Richard Cheney, the low key former White House
chief of staff, six-term Wyoming congressman, secretary of defense
during the Persian Gulf War and, most recently, an oil industry
tycoon.
</P>
<P>
   Once fellow Republicans and the media took a look at Cheney's
voting record in the House, they were shocked. He voted ``no'' on
everything from gun control to making civil rights leader Martin
Luther King's birthday a national holiday. His stunning negative
votes on social programs displayed a lot of conservatism, but no
compassion, conflicting with Bush's political mantra of
``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Cheney also avoided the Vietnam war, later
explaining: ``I had other priorities.'' Another student in the
sixties. Lieberman also took a pass on the war.
</P>
<P>
   The one-man selection system of vice presidents has actually
served the nation well and each successor has risen to the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   When FDR chose Truman, a relatively unknown senator from
Missouri, he created a lot of hard feelings because he had first
indicated to several prominent Democrats, including Supreme Court
Justice William O. Douglas and Secretary of State James Byrnes that
they were high on his list. Truman had the attractive
characteristic that he was not Vice President Henry Wallace, the
liberal who was anathema to the politicians in the smoke-filled
rooms in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, no one has matched the sanitized description of the
vice presidency as a ``warm bucket of spit'', which was uttered by
John Garner, the vice president in Roosevelt's first two terms. One
of the big surprises in the history of vice presidential choices
came at the 1960 Democratic convention in Los Angeles where John F.
Kennedy asked Lyndon B. Johnson to be his running mate. At the
time, Johnson was Kennedy's chief rival for the presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   As rumors spread that Kennedy would offer Johnson the No. 2 spot
on the ticket, the Texas delegation, headed by Speaker Sam Rayburn,
urged him not to accept it. Lady Bird Johnson also told her husband
to turn it down. The Texans were furious with the hard-ball
politics being played by the Kennedy clan after Kennedy had the
nomination nearly locked up before the convention began.
</P>
<P>
   When Kennedy decided that Johnson was the best man to help the
Democratic ticket in the South, he summoned Rayburn to his suite to
inform him of his choice. Rayburn balked, telling Kennedy that
Johnson would prefer to remain in the Senate as the majority
leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes you think, he will stay in the leadership,''
Kennedy asked the Speaker. The warning was clear. Rayburn went to
Johnson and told him he had to accept Kennedy's offer to be his
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson protested, saying, ``Yesterday, you told me not to take
it. What happened?.'' Rayburn's classic reply: ``I'm a much smarter
man today.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Johnson was not easily appeased. When the Texas delegation
gathered in the Johnson suite, as recalled by George Reedy,
Johnson's first press secretary, Johnson poked his finger at his
wife and told her: ``Don't you know, I'll be one heart beat away
from the presidency?''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson chafed under his loss of political power as vice
president. He was even more discomfited by the continual rumors
that Bobby Kennedy had started a ``dump Johnson'' movement to
remove him from Kennedy's reelection ticket in 1964. The rest is
history.
</P>
<P>
   When his turn came, Johnson also dangled the No. 2 spot to
several hopeful politicos who were summoned to the Oval Office. All
the while, he fully intended to offer it to Sen. Hubert Humphrey of
Minnesota. When he did, he told the senator: ``You know you're not
going to be anything but a (expletive deleted) messenger boy around
here.''
</P>
<P>
   No one ever accused LBJ of tact _ but no one ever doubted his
political smarts.

A NEW CRAZE IS AFOOT

<TEXT>
<P>
   They're sleek. They're hip. And as fads go, they're a lot more
fun than Furby.
</P>
<P>
   Why grumble about soaring gas prices when you can use a little
foot power and zip about on a motorless scooter?
</P>
<P>
   The scooters are manufactured under several names, including
Razor, Xootr and Kickboard. The Razor weighs in at just over 6
pounds, but the collapsible alloy aluminum frame can support up to
350 pounds. A telescoping handle extends to 35 inches and a rear
friction brake makes quick stops a cinch.
</P>
<P>
   I've been using one to get to the office, and it's turned a
seven-minute walk into a five-minute scoot. What's more, it's all
downhill going home _ a breeze of a ride in about three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But why relegate those speed-demon wheels to the asphalt and
concrete? They work even better on long, polished hallways at the
workplace. Just watch out for pedestrians exiting the elevator.
</P>
<P>
   Where do you get the wheels?
</P>
<P>
   Several retailers _ from the Sharper Image to department stores
_ price the Razor at $99. But I bought mine online for $75,
including shipping, through MobShop.com, a site where the more
people who join a buying cycle, the less you pay. The three-wheel
K2 Kickboard is $299 at www.rei.com.
</P>
<P>
   For ``high performance'' junkies, there's the Xootr scooter at
www.xootr.com. These luxury boards sport wheels made from ``an
exotic low-hysteresis polyurethane'' and come in three models
ranging in price from $269 to $489.
</P>
<P>
   Get rolling. I'll race you to work.

CULTURAL SABOTAGE WAGED IN CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALISSA QUART    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This summer, Frank DeGraff, a 19-year-old college student,
decided that he wanted to invest money through the Web so he
started working three jobs. When he had saved $200, he went to
RTMark.com and placed the money in one of the site's funds, the
Education Fund.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of money, the only returns he was promised were acts
of cultural sabotage. DeGraff is hoping that his investment will be
used for projects like making ``anti-souvenirs,'' aimed at various
social injustices and offered to tourists, or purchasing recorded
books by conservative pundits so leftist speeches can be recorded
over the original material and the tapes can be put back onto sales
racks in book stores.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, this is no typical investment firm. RTMark (the name
derives from ``registered trademark'' but is pronounced ``art
mark'') describes itself as a brokerage that ``supports the
sabotage of corporate products.'' Its projects have included
switching voice boxes in Barbie and GI Joe dolls and creating
Gatt.org, a look-alike Web site that lampooned the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I met RTMark through the Net,'' DeGraff said, ``I
thought I was alone in feeling like corporations were destroying
this country.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the popularity of RTMark is any indication, DeGraff is
far from alone. Last winter, the nine-year-old group managed to
summon thousands of Web surfers to the defense of a small Swiss art
project called etoy (www.etoy.com). The online toy seller eToys
(www.etoys.com) had tried to shut down etoy by filing
intellectual-property trademark suits, even though the Swiss group
had owned the domain name since 1995, before eToys existed.
</P>
<P>
   While eToys demanded that etoy give up its domain name, RTMark
helped coordinate a denial-of-service attack during Christmas week.
An estimated 10,000 members of this network of cybercrusaders sent
multiple e-mail messages to eToys, requesting information and using
false names to subscribe to an eToys registry. The action,
something of a virtual sit-in, brought down the company's servers.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, thanks in part to RTMark's efforts, the art group
won the right to keep its domain name and received $40,000 from
eToys to cover legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   But even after this very public action, RTMark remains something
of a mystery. The group's three core members use assumed names _
Candid Lucida, Ray Thomas and Frank Guerrero _ and refuse to reveal
their real names. They say they are in their 30s and work as a
schoolteacher, a lawyer and a financial analyst. Their ``fund
managers'' _ volunteers who help bring in investments and help
choose and allocate money to projects _ also tend to have a sketchy
understanding of who is behind RTMark, they say, because most of
their transactions occur via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas says he puts 10 hours a week into RTMark and lives in San
Francisco, thousands of miles from Guerrero, who lives in upstate
New York. Lucida, who lives in Los Angeles, said, ``We met on the
Web and still work over the Net.''
</P>
<P>
   Zach Exley, the network's collaborator on a parody George W.
Bush Web site that drew complaints from the Bush campaign, said he
had never met any of the three in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``We behave like a corporation and stay anonymous to limit
liability,'' Lucida said. In truth, some of the group's actions
could be considered illegal, said James Boyle, a professor of law
at Duke University Law School, but other actions could fall under
``fair use'' or First Amendment protection. ``Mostly, they are
relying most on being small, mobile and intelligent,'' Boyle said.
</P>
<P>
   RTMark's motto is to attack without causing physical injury, and
its projects sometimes go to extremes. There is the yearly
Corporate Poetry Contest, for example, in which users send in
actual e-mail exchanges with customer service representatives. Some
entries sound like found poetry composed in business-speak.
</P>
<P>
   This year, RTMark has championed small art sites _ among them
JKREW, Leonardo magazine, Healthnet.org and Bigmissmoviola.com _ in
more domain name skirmishes with corporations of similar names that
have told the small sites to stop using those Web addresses. Among
the future projects on its Web site is an action to place
unconventional greeting cards into supermarket displays; the cards
do things like congratulating people for eating free-range pork or
congratulating gay partners for their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Faceless, playful political theater against big business is not
new. RTMark is a part of a lively strain in American protest
politics that includes anarchists and Yippies. It is a contemporary
cybercrusade.
</P>
<P>
   RTMark offers ideas for anti-corporate pranks without charge on
the Web, much as online groups in the open-source movement believe
in making technology available to users so they may alter it as
they see fit. Like these groups, RTMark argues that the freedom to
appropriate and transform corporate products and Web sites is good
for intellectual progress. As one of RTMark's supporters put it
during the etoy struggle, ``The etoy battle allowed us to point out
that the Web has been corporatized.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said, ``We want to show that domain-name lawsuits
companies slap on artists are just like the lawsuits they spring on
ordinary people when they are fighting toxic waste in their
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   But like any guerrilla network given to over-the-top spectacles,
RTMark can make mistakes. The Bigmissmoviola.com domain name
struggle in June is a case in point. When J&AMP;R Film/Moviola Digital
demanded that Big Moviola, a women's film distribution network,
refrain from using ``Moviola'' in its Web address, the network's
26-year-old founder, Miranda July, got in touch with RTMark. RTMark
promptly sent irate e-mail messages to J&AMP;R/Moviola's employees and
threatened another virtual sit-in, akin to its etoys war.
</P>
<P>
   But this campaign had a different ending. For one thing, J&AMP;R
Film had trademarked ``Moviola'' in 1965 for its brand of
film-editing equipment. For another, J&AMP;R Film/Moviola is a small
family-run company with about 60 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``RTMark may have an interesting, important message about
corporate abuse of power,'' said Dana Newman, a lawyer for
J&AMP;R/Moviola, ``but our situation simply does not fit neatly into
their agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   July, for one, has given up her fight. While she still respects
RTMark, she says, she feels that her battle was swept up into the
group's larger agenda and tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could save the name Bigmissmoviola.com but be completely
defined by the battle,'' she said. She has since given up the
struggle for the name in any form and plans to rename her Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the group's pranksterism continues to entice
``investors'' and, now, owners of New York City art galleries. In
September at Exit Art, RTMark will present a parody on
biotechnology and gene patenting, using the Power Point software
that is often used for board-room presentations. Regarding that
exhibit, and one planned at the same gallery in 2001, Lucida is
typically blase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate the art world attention,'' she said, ``but we
wouldn't want to wind up in a museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas added, ``We are activists, not artists.''

`SPACE CHANNEL 5': DANCE WITH ALIENS AND SAVE THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLES HEROLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With her pink pigtails, orange gloves and platform go-go boots
and a green ray gun worn like a garter, Ulala the space reporter is
enough by herself to make anyone want to play Sega's ``Space
Channel 5.'' At its heart is a simple memory game, but that is its
least important element. Here we have the ultimate victory of style
over substance, a little arcade game encased in glittering color
and driven by infectious dance beats.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Space Channel 5,'' aliens invade 25th-century Earth and
force the humans to dance. Ulala, an intrepid television reporter,
finds that she can save the human race by copying the alien dances,
move for move. With each victory, the ratings for her program,
``Ulala's Space Report'' (broadcast on Space Channel 5), go up, but
every misstep knocks the ratings down. If her dancing isn't up to
par, her program will be canceled, and the human race will be
doomed to an endless disco nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Playing the game involves hitting the right button at the right
time. The aliens _ short, colorful creatures with antennae and
faces like television screens _ do a little dance while calling out
their steps: ``Up, right. Left, down. Kick! Kick! Kick!''
</P>
<P>
   With their cute, high voices and endless jumping, the aliens
could be teaching line dancing to children on ``Sesame Street.''
Using the game controller, you make Ulala do the same little dance
as the aliens _ same steps, same rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   If she can keep up, she can free the humans, who will join her
for a victory dance while her director shouts, ``You go, Ulala!''
as if he were a morning DJ waking up his listeners. If she doesn't
do well enough, she does a dance of mourning, holding her hands to
her head and sighing deeply. As the game progresses, the dances
become more difficult, with more frequent changes in tempo and more
complex rhythms. At times you will have to shoot aliens and rescue
humans, making sure to shoot the aliens with your alien-killing
button and saving the humans with your human-saving button.
</P>
<P>
   It's a simple game, but often not an easy one. Usually when
people say something is dreamlike or has dream logic, they mean
that it is surreal, symbolic or unusual in its form and structure.
But ``Space Channel 5'' is like a real dream _ filled with
senseless events and a story that jumps from one idea to the next
in a disjointed fashion. Whether Ulala is rescuing a mesmerized
Space Michael (a Michael Jackson lookalike), outdancing the
ultimate robot reporter, Evila, or saving a group of children from
a giant dance robot, this game makes no sense whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   With chic visuals and music that is somewhere between a James
Bond theme and a James Brown hit, all horns and bass, it doesn't
matter whether it's really a reporter's job to outdance aliens or
whether 1960s fashions will be popular in the 25th century. As
Ulala strides along with the beat, walking like one of Robert
Crumb's ``Keep on Truckin''' characters, the player is carried
along, bouncing in rhythm in his or her seat, waiting for the next
round.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the game was created in Japan should come as no
surprise. Japanese game designers have a talent for fast-paced,
over-the-top entertainment unhampered by logic but informed by
impeccable style. ``Space Channel 5'' is a thrill ride with
flashing lights and explosions, psychedelic play masquerading as a
video game. It bypasses your brain's logic center entirely, making
a direct connection to its center for fun.
</P>
<P>
   The frenetic choreography, catchy music and Day-Glo colors _ and
phrases like ``Groove evening, ladies and gentlemen'' _ all seem
designed to shut down your thinking and have you rely entirely on
the primal dancer within. Perhaps it is Zen, tearing apart the
logical cage of our brain, or perhaps it is nothing more than the
video game equivalent of a good party, but whatever it is, it
works.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Ulala, with the help of two fellow reporters, Pudding
and Jaguar, will blow to bits the giant robot made out of
televisions and save the world from the dancing aliens. Then you'll
be able to read the credits and discover that in keeping with the
surreal nature of the game, Ulala's voice is done by someone named
Apollo Smile.
</P>
<P>
   Like a particularly strange dream, the details of ``Space
Channel 5'' will evaporate when you wake up, and you'll find
yourself with only a vague idea of what happened. ``The aliens were
being hypnotized,'' you'll tell your friends. ``There was something
about ratings. There were space tourists dancing with cameras and a
space keyboard girl and, and well, it was weird.'' By the end of
the day, you won't remember even that much. But you'll find
yourself walking along the street singing, ``Up! Up-up-up! Right!
Left, down!'' And you'll always remember Ulala standing on the
launching pad, saying: ``What's this? Something's up. I'm feeling
kind of funky!''
</P>

$39.95; for teen-agers.

<P>
   DARK HARBOR, Maine _ The centerpiece on the table was a humble
ceramic head of lettuce, just as Sister Parish, the grande dame of
American decor, had placed it there decades ago. But on a recent
afternoon, as the summer clouds finally parted to allow in the
buttery northern sunshine, everything else in the room was on the
brink of commotion. The chintz was about to hit the fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to squish 26 people into this room,'' said Apple
Parish Bartlett, the owner of the house, where her illustrious
mother had spent nearly all of her 84 summers. ``We'll just shuffle
things around a little. Then we'll put it back, inch by inch.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett, 66, is a painter and dealer in decorative furnishings,
but the coming occasion was a dinner to celebrate the publication
of ``Sister: The Life of Legendary American Interior Decorator
Henry Parish II'' (St. Martin's Press), by Bartlett and her
daughter Susan Bartlett Crater. The book is a loving oral biography
of Sister Parish, Bartlett's mother, who shaped the domestic
aesthetic of various Kennedys, Astors, Paleys and Whitneys, until
her death in 1994. The invited guests for the party included the
staff of Parish-Hadley, the upper-crust New York firm formed by
Parish and the Tennessee-born decorator Albert Hadley (it closed
last year). By any measure, this was going to be a tough crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, shutters lay on the rolling lawn, awaiting a new coat
of paint. But inside, what to do? The clutter of this old Maine
house _ ceramic parrots, carved wooden dogs, embroidered pillows
sprawled on mattress-ticking upholstery, flags and quilts
everywhere _ was just the sort of froufrou over which the
supertraditional Parish and the modern Hadley had not seen eye to
steely eye. She loved it, he did not, and this difference was a key
to their creative partnership, the yin and yang of it. Here in Dark
Harbor, the centripetal force of Parish whirled unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   Stuff was everywhere. Bartlett saw no need to do anything
drastic about it. ``Oh, it always looks like this,'' she said,
smiling at the bold clash of orange print wallpaper and
raspberry-colored flooring (evidently from the high-Yankee
psychedelic era). ``How do you improve upon perfection?''
</P>
<P>
   The Summer House, as it is known in family circles, is an
unpretentious clapboard ranch house on a gentle waterfront slope.
Bartlett, who is divorced, lives here until the season turns, when
she moves to the Winter House, just down the hill. The Summer House
was the center of Parish's world, the exemplar of generational
continuity she stressed in her work. In 1967, House &AMP; Garden
magazine ran spreads of the house, bursting with wicker and
needlepoint and other crafts. Seldom had old-fashioned looked so
revolutionary. ``This was where the whole American country style
started,'' Crater said, repeating a truism of decor lore. From her
mouth to Martha Stewart's ear.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, Crater and Bartlett pondered an often-reported
family legend. Did Parish really swat a young Caroline Kennedy,
precipitating a split between the decorator and her most
illustrious client? ``I don't know how it got started,'' Bartlett
said. In fact, the story appears in their book, in an excerpt from
Parish's journal. ``But we wouldn't want to get into that whole
thing,'' said Crater, an artist. The girl ``probably had her feet
up on the sofa, and Sister probably swatted them away. That would
not have been beyond belief at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett laughed knowingly. ``In a funny way,'' she said, Parish
``was just imperious.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy ``Sister'' Parish was for the last half of the 20th
Century the queen of American decoration, reigning over three
generations of design luminaries, including Mark Hampton, Keith
Irvine, Bunny Williams and Mario Buatta. Her influence trickled
down to Ralph Lauren and Martha Stewart. If you have a quilt, you
probably owe it to Parish.
</P>
<P>
   Decorating is a hand-holding business, and Parish held some
regal hands, from Babe Paley's to Betsey Whitney's. She nearly
decorated for real royalty, too. But anti-American outrage _ and
her high prices _ prevented her from decorating the home of the
Duke and Duchess of York.
</P>
<P>
   Born into the Eastern establishment _ her father was Edith
Wharton's doctor _Sister Parish used her fierce eye, strong ego and
social connections to impose her generous, florid, unpretentious
vision on a country shaking off the chill of Victorian stuffiness
in the postwar years. Her vision included chintz and plenty of it,
often in bewildering, unmatched plenty. Parish, her daughter said,
did not go in for ``matchy-matchy.''
</P>
<P>
   A word here about names. Apple was born May Appleton Parish.
Sister was the nickname given to a young Dorothy May Kinnicutt by
her three brothers. The sobriquet lent itself to occasional odd
constructions, like ``my aunt Sister,'' as well as to
misunderstandings: when Jacqueline Kennedy tapped Parish to spiff
up the living quarters on Pennsylvania Avenue, Bartlett said, one
newspaper reported that a nun was redecorating the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett and Crater said they intended their book to be a social
history, capturing the milieu of Murray Hill and Dark Harbor and
other closed social worlds before the democratic creep of
post-1960s modernity, to say nothing of gazillionaire rock stars
and dot-commers, penetrated the blueblood walls. Constructed in the
manner of Jean Stein and George Plimpton's ``Edie,'' with blocks of
quotations from friends and relatives alternating with excerpts
from Parish's journal, the book is a portrait of society without
the John O'Hara elements: no drinking, no adultery, no bad
behavior. And no dollar figures. ``We weren't interested in that
next level of psycho-biography,'' Crater said.
</P>
<P>
   They gloss delicately over a level of high-decor bloodshed,
including battles over the Kennedy White House, the commission that
so raised Parish's profile. James Abbott, author of ``Designing
Camelot: The Kennedy White House Restoration,'' said that shortly
into Parish's endeavors, Kennedy asked others, including the
Parisian decorator Stephane Boudin, to revise the rooms. ``A number
of times, Sister Parish threatened to quit,'' he continued, adding
that Parish ultimately obtained permission to take credit for one
of Boudin's window treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Such battles come with the territory, and with the fickle
clients who rule it, said the decorator Mario Buatta, who was
devoted to Parish. ``Those women weren't going to be faithful to
you,'' Buatta continued. ``I remember she called one client and
said, `It's going to kill my husband if you let someone else do
that room.' She was very controlling. You had to be.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The excerpts from Parish's journals reveal a more subtle form of
manipulation, the art behind the decorator's art. She stressed the
need to please husbands, who commonly paid the (often
stratospheric) bills. ``We did the largest, most elaborate job in
San Francisco for the Gettys, and Getty's sole interest was the
piano. We paid a great deal of attention to the acoustics in the
music room, and everything else just fell into place beautifully,''
she wrote, adding that once a decorator reels in the husband, ``he
becomes eager to keep going.'' And at that point, she concluded,
``you've won.''
</P>
<P>
   The book also offers a glimpse of an insular world that was
receding even as Parish was triumphing in it. It's a window
treatment on history.
</P>
<P>
   As Hadley remembers his introduction to the Kennedy White House:
``The first time I went there, the yellow room was being done. The
day we went was the day of the Bay of Pigs invasion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dark Harbor house stands just as it did in Parish's day,
give or take a few new photographs and the odd crack in the walls.
In the master bedroom is the canopied bed on which she was born,
and on which she died. ``People can't believe that I sleep in the
bed someone died in,'' said Crater, who was in the middle of a
six-week visit. ``I don't think that's a strange thing.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of their research, Crater and her mother scoured the
family dressers and attics. They found letters from Edith Wharton.
They found recipes. ``She kept every one,'' Crater said, ``and she
was not a cook. We found one that said, `Rice: Put water in pot.
Put rice in water. Boil.'''
</P>
<P>
   Social histories are usually told after the fall, and the
influence of Parish has waned, eroded on one side by the mass
merchandizing of Americana and on the other by the triumph of
high-end modernism. The chintz, like the Social Register set that
championed it, has lost some of its glaze. ``The clients were
different then,'' Crater said of her grandmother's 1960s heyday.
``Now, a lot of people want to look rich, they want everybody to
notice where they are in the world. The Whitneys and the Paleys and
that crowd, they weren't proving that.''
</P>
<P>
   In Dark Harbor, though, Parish's influence still rules the homey
sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Bartlett finds her greatest happiness in yard sales.
She described a trip to the local dump, where she salvaged material
from a discarded sofa. Her eagle-eyed mother would have been proud
_ and might have grabbed some, too. And if the stories in
``Sister'' are any indication, she might have commanded a bundle
for it.

ISP GIANTS ABOUND, BUT LOCAL PROVIDERS MAY BE MORE LIKE FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Maine, Colo., Calif.)  By KATIE HAFNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the past four years, I have remained loyal to my Internet
service provider.
</P>
<P>
   It is not Earthlink, nor is it Mindspring. And it is definitely
not America Online.
</P>
<P>
   When possible, I support cottage industries. My milk comes from
a local dairy, and my Internet connection comes from a small
company in Santa Rosa, Calif., called Sonoma Interconnect, or
Sonic. Few people outside Sonoma County have heard of it.
</P>
<P>
   Sonic's 30 or so employees work in a small office building in
downtown Santa Rosa, two doors from a pawnshop and across from the
town square.
</P>
<P>
   I could pay my $20 each month to any ISP and get about the same
thing, of course, but subscribing to Sonic makes me feel virtuous
and civic-minded.
</P>
<P>
   Being a Sonic customer today must be a lot like being a customer
of Woodbury Telephone Co. in Connecticut 50 years ago, or any of
the thousands of small telephone companies before they were
swallowed by the Bell System. Or maybe it's like living in a town
that still has a thriving independent bookstore, whose owners have
a stake in the local community that is more than merely financial.
</P>
<P>
   Web service providers like Sonic were common in the early 1990s.
But in the past five years or so, many of the smallest ones have
disappeared while AOL and a handful of others have undergone
explosive growth.
</P>
<P>
   By numbers alone, the Web service business doesn't look so dire.
Boardwatch magazine, which tracks ISPs, recently reported more than
7,400 providers in North America, an increase of roughly 2,000
during the last year. But those numbers reflect the changing nature
of the business itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of ISPs are part of another business,'' said Todd Judd
Erickson, managing editor of Boardwatch. Erickson pointed out that
Denver's two main newspapers used the servers, routers, modems and
phone lines they already had on hand to offer Internet service, as
do several of the nation's banks. ``If they have to have the
equipment in their office anyway, they might as well offer Internet
service,'' Erickson said.
</P>
<P>
   It is the typical homespun Internet service provider, serving a
thousand or so local customers from a small office filled with
modems, that has it rough these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pure dial-up ISP play is tough to make money on because
it's becoming such a commodity,'' Erickson said. ``If you don't
like your ISP, just go with another one.''
</P>
<P>
   Dane Jasper, a freckle-faced 27-year-old, his hair peppered with
subtle highlights of pink and green, dropped out of the local
junior college six years ago to start Sonic. Two years ago, Jasper
said, Sonic belonged to a group of seven independent companies that
called themselves the California Independently Owned ISP
Association. But one by one, those small companies have been
acquired by larger providers, making Sonic the sole survivor,
Jasper said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a minefield that we walk through,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With 15,000 customers, Sonic is one of the bigger independent
Web service providers. FIX Net, a 7-year-old provider in San Luis
Obispo, Calif., has just 5,000 customers. And Downeast.net, a
company in Ellsworth, Maine, is even smaller, with 1,000 customers.
The companies have bolstered their businesses with commercial
customers.
</P>
<P>
   To compete effectively against the behemoths, small companies
need to offer personalized customer service, said Cheryl Woodard,
28, the president, chief executive and chief financial officer at
FIX Net. (``I sell popcorn at halftime, too,'' she said.)
</P>
<P>
   Calls to FIX Net for technical support are not farmed out to a
call center in Utah, Ireland or points beyond. Woodard said,
``People can walk in the door and meet the technician who's been
helping them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonic is similar. Call tech support, and you are treated like
royalty. Any of the 15 technicians, several of them still
teen-agers, focus on your problem with the single-mindedness of
emergency room doctors rallying to someone who has been transported
to the hospital by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   At FIX Net, Woodard offers free classes. Both FIX Net and
Downeast.net invite customers to haul in their computers to have
software installed at no charge. ``We do an awful lot of
hand-holding,'' said Don McKillop, who owns Downeast.net with his
wife, Jean, and Noel Paul Stookey, of Peter, Paul and Mary.
</P>
<P>
   At Sonic, Jasper makes the occasional house call. Still, Jasper
said, it is hard to compete with the flood of advertising and
sign-up rewards from the likes of AOL and Microsoft's MSN. ``All
the big players are spending hundreds of dollars to acquire new
customers,'' he said. ``So we just took a huge chunk of our
advertising budget and started paying it to customers for
referrals. Everyone who refers someone to us gets a $20 check in
the mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the community aspect of a local service provider.
Go to FIX Net's home page, and you will see a grid of images
depicting local scenes: the bell from the San Luis Obispo mission,
the nearby coastline. The company's official slogan is ``Worldwide
Technology _ Hometown Service and Support.''
</P>
<P>
   Local ties are also important for Sopris Surfers, a Web service
provider in Carbondale, Colo., 30 miles north of Aspen, with 5,000
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in our valley want to keep their money local,'' said
Paul Huttenhower, chief executive of Sopris Surfers.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite thing about Sonic is the sense I have that Jasper
and his employees want to keep me informed about the technical
goings-on behind the curtain.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I once used Sonic for full Web access, but now that I have that
access through my job, I use Sonic mainly for personal e-mail.
While Sonic offers regular e-mail service, I go online through my
company's system and retrieve my Sonic e-mail via Telnet, a
command-based method for logging into a computer remotely. When I
log on at Sonic, I get an opening screen that is a diary of sorts,
an intimate run-down of the week's technical ups and downs. Such a
greeting upon logging in is known in the Unix world as the Message
of the Day, or MOTD.
</P>
<P>
   One typical MOTD from last month:
</P>
<P>
   ``The remote access equipment that serves the 522-1002 dial-up
group blew a circuit breaker a half an hour ago as the load grew
this morning. Eli made it down to our NOC to redistribute the
equipment across a second circuit and has restored all access. _
Kelsey''
</P>
<P>
   And one from June:
</P>
<P>
   ``We've completed the migration to piggy; all multihomed
websites are now load balanced and enjoy the reliability and
performance of redundant web servers. _ Kelsey and Scott''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not you understand or even care about the technical
jargon, the dispatches offer a glimpse into the vicissitudes and
rhythms of a Web service provider, which can be difficult to
imagine when you are on the other end of the line.
</P>
<P>
   It can be argued that informing customers of the system's every
hiccup will interest only a few technical junkies, that it is like
sending a lengthy readout to the dashboard every time you start
your car: ``Last night's frost took the viscosity of the 10-40 oil
to the upper ranges, increasing the load on the starter motor. The
3-year-old battery did some extra work to turn the crankshaft.''
</P>
<P>
   But I would argue that the Sonic bulletins, typos and all, help
keep people like me loyal. The MOTDs make the machines seem like
family. I know, for instance, Sonic's three Web servers are named
Thunder, Mistral and Storm.
</P>
<P>
   Further, I know that Jasper and his employees will tell it to me
straight. Earlier this year, for instance, when demand for digital
subscriber line service increased, the Sonic staff was frank about
installation delays:
</P>
<P>
   ``Pacific Bell appears to be overwhelmed by the response to the
current promotion for DSL,'' they wrote. ``If you have an
installation scheduled with Pacific Bell for DSL, keep in mind that
they may fail to arrive, or they may arrive very late in the day,
in some cases as late as 9 p.m. _ Dane, Eli, Jen and Nicole''
</P>
<P>
   Then, when the ``I Love You'' virus hit in May, staff members
patted themselves on the back while issuing a reminder: ``The
filtering that we put in place for the ``I Love You'' virus caught
over 1,200 copies of the virus and its mutations overnight. Just a
reminder, always be cautious of unexpected e-mail attachments,
especially executable programs or scripts. _ Kelsey''
</P>
<P>
   And last month, this delightful recap of some late-night work:
``Night operations are complete, and went well. Kelsey and Scooter
upgraded the news server to 1 gig of RAM, and it has been moved
into a new cabinet location. The BroadLink guys moved their DSLAM
into their dedicated rack here in the data center. Then we had
doughnuts, but the BroadLink folks went missing before eating
theirs, and we're not quite sure why. _ Dane (and a bunch of sleepy
ops)''
</P>
<P>
   Who, I wondered as the message scrolled down and off my screen,
are the BroadLink guys? Were they aggrieved somehow? And were the
doughnuts Krispy Kremes? If so, where in town does one even find
Krispy Kremes?
</P>
<P>
   The MOTDs are less readily accessible to Sonic customers who
don't use Telnet. Those customers must either have the messages
sent to them via e-mail or read them on the Sonic home page
(www.sonic.net). Jasper said that more than 700 people had the
messages sent to them. Some even have the messages sent to their
cell phones or pagers. ``There's a bit of a cult following around
the MOTDs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Being a Sonic customer isn't very convenient for people who
travel frequently because the local dial-up numbers are restricted
to Northern California. But if I bailed out of this small, familiar
place tomorrow and signed on with AOL, or AT&AMP;T Worldnet, I would
miss more than just the MOTDs. I would miss the satisfaction I get
whenever I drive into town and pass the Sonic offices and imagine
them in there: Dane, Kelsey, Scooter, Eli, Jen, Nicole and everyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   As I pass by, I think about what they might be doing at that
moment. Perhaps they're talking someone through a connectivity
meltdown, or installing a new router or migrating file transfer
protocol data to the new NetApp F740.
</P>
<P>
   And all's right with the world.

   New GPS Attachment Can Keep You on Track
</P>
<P>
   Lost while driving in a unfamiliar city? A new Global
Positioning System receiver slightly larger than a matchbox
attaches to a wide variety of hand-helds or laptops, enabling them
to provide directions like a native and a moving map that monitors
every turn.
</P>
<P>
   Pharos Science and Applications, based in Torrance, Calif.,
designed the $199 iGPS-180 receiver with road warriors in mind.
Business people need a GPS device that is portable, said James
Oyahg, the company's chairman. The iGPS-180 connects to any laptop
with a standard nine-pin serial port; there are custom cables to
connect the Palm and Visor hand-helds, as well as the Pocket PCs
(like the latest Cassiopeia models from Casio). The small receiver
has a cable that plugs into a car's cigarette lighter; when used
with a Cassiopeia, the lighter connection will power both the
receiver and the hand-held.
</P>
<P>
   Palm and Visor hand-helds and laptops can use any mapping
software that conforms to National Marine Electronics Association
Standard 2.0 or higher. For Pocket PCs, Pharos has an $89 mapping
program that lets the hand-held issue voice prompts like ``there is
a left turn ahead.'' In a test run, the Cassiopeia voice alerts
were somewhat unreliable, coming too early, too late or not at all
for some turns. And sometimes the device did not plot the best
route. But the map, which shows to its best advantage on color
screens, was always right on the mark.

   E-Mail Fans Are Friendly Folks, A Sociology Study Indicates
</P>
<P>
   The more you use the Net, the more likely you are to be in
communication with friends and relatives, whether in person, by
phone or by e-mail. At least that's what Keith Hampton, an
assistant professor in the department of urban studies and planning
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Barry Wellman, a
sociology professor at the University of Toronto, found after
analyzing a survey of 40,456 North Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that people who e-mail also talk more in person and
on the phone,'' Hampton said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the survey, which was presented at the American
Sociological Association's annual meeting, which ended Wednesday,
people who used the Internet only once or twice a year had 471
contacts of all kinds with friends and relatives who lived within
30 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Daily Internet users, by contrast, exchanged e-mail or had
conversations _ either in person or by phone _ with nearby friends
and relatives 1,312 times.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast became even more striking for more distant friends
and family members. People who rarely used the Net communicated
only about 75 times a year. Heavy Net users, however, had 997
exchanges a year. The two researchers considered about 40 Internet-
and community-related questions that were included in a survey
partly sponsored by the National Geographic Society and carried on
its Web site in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Wellman said other data from the study suggested that e-mail was
not, however, dislodging traditional forms of communications among
friends and family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is a huge add-on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Could it just be that heavy Internet users are just naturally
more friendly _ or chatty? ``I don't think you can tell at this
point if people who go online are inherently more communicative,''
Hampton said.

   Thomas Beller, a writer in New York, is putting literature on
the map. Beller's Neighborhood, a new Web site
(www.mrbellersneighborhood.com), divides an aerial view of
Manhattan into nine areas, then links essays, poems and stories to
the locations where they are set. If the viewer zooms in on the
Upper East Side, for example, a red dot at 77th Street and Madison
Avenue leads to W.H. Auden's poem ``In Schrafft's.''
</P>
<P>
   Beller, author of the novel ``The Sleep-Over Artist,'' said the
project, which was produced with the online magazine Word.com, was
``a narrative that sprawls in many directions.'' In other words,
it's all over the map.

 By PETER MARKS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Phil Alongi was eager to share a view of the
Democratic convention from his favorite perspective. ``Over here,''
he said excitedly, motioning to a temporarily uncrowded corner on
the convention floor near the Tennessee delegation. ``I want you to
get the whole effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Alongi, senior producer of special events for NBC News, directed
his gaze out across the floor and up at the object of his aesthetic
affection: the NBC sky booth. Indeed, the two-tiered structure,
painted ``NBC red'' _ a custom blend of 87 percent red, 12 percent
yellow and 1 percent blue _ and outfitted with decorative flaps and
balcony, was a thing of grand theatrical charms. The Graceland, if
you will, of convention anchor booths.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's supposed to make you feel, `Here we are, America. We're
bringing this into your homes. We've swung open and we're here,'''
Alongi said. ``The flaps, they're to create a feeling of openness,
so that the front of the booth flares out.''
</P>
<P>
   And what of that attached balcony, with the railing that could
have been pried off a beach house in Malibu? ``Remember,'' Alongi
advised. ``It's L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   If the role of the contemporary political convention has
undergone a radical transformation, from procedural forum to
multimedia spectacle, so has the role of the modern network skybox.
Once little more than a spartan cave from which the likes of Chet
Huntley or Walter Cronkite could look out over the convention floor
and point out the party chairmen from Cook County and Brooklyn, the
booth has become a statement unto itself.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most cursory look up from the floor of the Staples
Center, where the Democrats conclude their proceedings Thursday
night, provides a sense of how many different statements a sky
booth can make. Clustered together at one end of the arena, the
network booths make for an eclectic, disposable village, one that
is built at great expense, inhabited for a week, and torn down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only time I've designed and built something that nine
days later is gone,'' said David Rasche, the Chicago architect who
designed the booth to house the arena studios for NBC and its
sister operations, MSNBC and MSNBC.com. ``It's there and it's
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast networks may be scaling back their coverage,
conceding to cable the task of gavel-to-gavel attention, but the
conventions remain such crucial showcases for exhibiting
reportorial and technological know-how that the competition over
booth design has actually grown more intense. NBC, in fact, points
out that it won an American Institute of Architects award for its
booth at the 1996 Democratic convention in Chicago, designed by
Rasche's firm, Valerio Dewalt Train Associates.
</P>
<P>
   The $500,000 booth apparently caused a stir; The Chicago
Tribune's architecture critic observed at the time that ``the
booth's size, color and sculptural form make it look as if it's
about to take off from its lower-skybox-level mooring'' and added
it ``set off a serious case of booth envy among the other
networks.'' The networks declined to say how much they spent on the
booths this year, but one news executive said the overall cost to a
network of covering a convention runs as high as $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our anchor booth is very futuristic and I guarantee
you when you look up there, the brightest sign is `ABC News,'''
said Roger Goodman, vice president of special projects for, yes,
ABC News. The ABC sign is, in fact, a departure from convention
wisdom: unlike the ``light boxes'' that other networks use to flash
their logos, ABC has affixed an electronic ``video wall'' to the
booth and installed behind it a smaller one beaming the company's
signature revolving globe.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC design is a concession to fiscal reality. (Unlike other
networks, ABC's control room is not on-site but remains in New York
City.) And just as unusually, ABC uses the booth more as window
dressing than as the centerpiece of its programming. Peter Jennings
is doing the news from the convention floor and from a suite just
off the floor, and the convention background is added by computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted Peter to have access to the floor for more accurate
and better-quality reporting,'' said Marc Burstein, executive
producer of special events for ABC News.
</P>
<P>
   The network booths do indeed seem to shout ``Look at me!''
whether the sentiment is reflected in the neutral-toned,
scallop-windowed sleekness of the CNN sky booth, or the modular
spareness of the double-decker CBS shelter, painted a traditional
CBS lapis blue. (Only the PBS skybox has more modest ambitions,
advertising itself with a simple sign that seems to whisper,
``NewsHour With Jim Lehrer.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted a clean, high tech contemporary look,'' said Gary
Bastien, the Irvine, Calif., architect who designed the CBS booth.
``The approach was that CBS is such a cutting-edge media-type
company and that's what we wanted to symbolize.'' (If you call
``Survivor'' cutting edge, and they probably do.'') To make the
facade as dynamic as possible, Bastien said, ``we used angular
forms and uplighting.''
</P>
<P>
   What the scenic and production designers have to do is rapidly
turn basic sports-arena skyboxes into customized television
studios. NBC, for instance, will convert the booths back into
skyboxes in nine days. Some networks combine two and even three
adjacent boxes to accommodate their sets and anchor desks; others
make use of skyboxes on top of each other for a vertical effect.
The quarters are tight: from floor to ceiling measures only seven
and a half feet, and the network specifications for
camera-readiness are precise down to the glare-free angle of the
booth windows overlooking the convention floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to be concerned with how you put in a piece of glass
without a seam in it that is 24 feet long and 7 feet high and is
angled precisely at 14 degrees, so you don't have a reflection,''
Bastien said. ``It can't be 13 degrees and it can't be 15. It's
something over the years that they know that works.''
</P>
<P>
   The designs so mimic the demands and constraints of outdoor
architecture that the networks even seek variances from the
convention planners to add to the dimensions of the boxes, as if
they were summer bungalows getting new decks. Both NBC and CNN, for
instance, extended the booths three feet into the hall to give the
anchors more elbow room.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a case of form following function,'' said Craig
McMahon, CNN's director of production design. That does not mean,
however, that there is not room for imagination. The bay windows in
CNN's gleaming horizontal booth, designed by Rene Lagler, a veteran
television set designer who created the podium for the Democratic
convention, are intended as a visual echo of the rounded style of
the twin anchor desks occupied by Larry King, and Bernard Shaw and
Judy Woodruff.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, only so far a designer can really
experiment at an event so richly evocative of all things
traditionally American. The stars and stripes tend to get a heavy
workout in the patterns chosen for the sets and backdrops in the
booths. Victor Paganuzzi, the production designer for CBS and a
veteran of 13 conventions, said the color scheme is pretty much a
foregone conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt,'' he said, ``that red, white and blue is
perfect for the occasion.''

   Hooray for Amgen, like, totally.
</P>
<P>
   The Thousand Oaks, Calif., biotech firm recently gave all those
valley girls-turned-working moms something to kvell over: In June,
the company opened its newly expanded child-care facility, Camp
Amgen, a 44,856-square-foot romper room thought to be the largest
corporate day-care center in the United States. The facility can
handle up to 430 kids in 32 classrooms and offers its services to
employees for 10 percent to 15 percent less than comparable
day-care centers.
</P>
<P>
   Camp Amgen isn't just big; it's good. The National Association
for the Education of Young Children has given the facility
consistently high marks. It's a good thing for employees, the
company's getting good press, and the kids are in good hands. You'd
think other businesses _ and lawmakers _ would catch on.
</P>
<P>
   But high-quality, affordable child care still eludes many
working parents _ especially those of little means, advocates say.
Only one in 10 eligible low-income children are receiving federal
assistance for child-care services, according to the Department of
Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   Even for middle-income families, day-care costs are a stretch. A
study co-conducted by the Children's Defense Fund in 1998 found
that the average cost of child care in Dallas was $4,838 a year for
a 12-month-old.
</P>
<P>
   And you thought the college fund would be challenging.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate have passed
versions of the 2001 appropriations bill that includes child-care
funding, and a compromise bill is in the works. Although the Senate
and House versions both increase funding for child care in 2001,
the language of the House bill could threaten funding in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Defense Fund Web site, www.childrensdefense.org,
explains the details of the legislation and also offers Child Care
Challenge books that address the cost, quality and availability of
child care by state. &QL;

<P>
   Ooooooo, this new school year came fast. Hardly have we finished
gluing collages, practicing our spelling and cleaning out the
debris in the backpacks (so that's where all the Easter candy
went!), when we're at it again: overparenting our kids through
another year.
</P>
<P>
   But with a new year comes a chance for a fresh start, a clean
slate, if you will. An opportunity to walk away from our parenting
bank of bad habits and start drawing on some more substantial moral
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Here are new school-year resolutions, for us, for you, for all
moms who, no matter what we do for or to our children, always do it
in the name of love.
</P>
<P>
   1. I will make sure my child gets enough sleep. (Even if she
cries, whines and whimpers, and tells me I'm the meanest mom in the
world.)
</P>
<P>
   2. I will get my child to school on time. (Even if I'm still
wearing my pajamas when we get there.)
</P>
<P>
   3. I will eat breakfast OR dinner at a table with my family at
least once a day, with no TVs, no books, no spelling words.
</P>
<P>
   4. I will not rescue my child by bringing the homework he has
forgotten. For the third day in a row.
</P>
<P>
   5. I will not threaten the other kid, the ``bad kid,'' but will
let my child fight her own battles, as long as she is not truly in
danger.
</P>
<P>
   6. I will believe: My child's homework is MY CHILD'S homework. I
will believe: She can do it on her own.
</P>
<P>
   7. I will not be annoyed by the room mother who calls me at the
last minute and wants 24 cupcakes for tomorrow. In fact, I will be
the room mother _ or her assistant, because even though I don't
have the time, I realize no one else does either.
</P>
<P>
   8. I will go on one field trip with the class, or lead one Fun
Friday activity, or volunteer to read each week, or somehow help my
child's teacher, because she is my ally and she must remain strong.
</P>
<P>
   9. I will really know my child's friends.
</P>
<P>
   10. I will not say ``Not now'' to my child without thinking
first: ``Why not now?''

consider Bride Whelan something of a seer whose medium is color.
Tell her whether red, blue or green speaks most forcefully to you,
and she'll describe your personality, your style, your values. She
will insist, however, that there's nothing psychic about her
abilities, that ample evidence from science, history and psychology
explains the link between personality and color.
</P>
<P>
   Given her color-coded perspective on the world _ she has
consulted on color, taught, and written two books on the subject _
the question inevitability arises: What kind of colors does she use
at home?
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Whelan (who pronounces her first name BRI-dee) moved
from a 10-room house in Southport, Conn., where she had lived for
23 years, into a one-bedroom apartment in midtown Manhattan. The
move was precipitated, she said, by the classic causes: ``The
children left home, the dog died, and the cat ran away.''
</P>
<P>
   After 20 years of commuting, she wanted a place near her job as
the executive director of the Society of Publication Designers,
which has its office on East 42nd Street. A cheerful and engaging
woman who cannot walk down a block without running into someone she
knows, Whelan decided to forgo a broker in her search, figuring she
could do better on her own. She set out on foot, visiting buildings
and talking to doormen in the buildings that looked appealing.
</P>
<P>
   That tactic quickly turned up an apartment to rent on Park
Avenue near 39th Street, in a gracious building that is the epitome
of the old New York. The building has helpful doormen, an elevator
run by a human, and apartments with high ceilings, attractive
moldings and well-proportioned rooms. Whelan's apartment, a condo
that rents for $2,500 a month _ with a right of first refusal if
the owner decides to sell _ has a substantial foyer, a dining room
next to the galley kitchen, a large living room with an arched
entryway and a fireplace, and an equally spacious bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   The walls, surprisingly, are white. So are the couches in the
living room, and the spread and drapes in the bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the choices are temporary, others quite deliberate. She
always has white couches, Whelan says, because they provide a good
backdrop for the yellows and oranges she likes to use in rugs,
pillows and artwork.
</P>
<P>
   A multicolored quilt will eventually go on the bed, after she
makes some repairs to it. She is planning to paint one wall of the
living room a yellow orange, to give it the warmth and motion she
wants. ``Orange is a friendly color,'' she says. ``It says, I want
to be your friend. Orange means you like things to be pleasant and
happy. Yellow is always about motion.''
</P>
<P>
   But she'll do only one wall. ``I don't like a lot of color on
the walls,'' she says. ``I'd rather have a lot of color around
me.'' The bedroom, too, may eventually get a coat of a soft yellow.
</P>
<P>
   The colors she wears, she says, are quite different from the
colors she uses at home. To her office, she is likely to wear blue,
a color she says confers authority. When she shows up at a meeting
in a blue suit, she says, she is sending a message that she is in
charge. Black is something else. ``Black is always hostile, but's
it's very defining,'' she says, which may explain why it is the
color of New York.
</P>
<P>
   At home, she surrounds herself with warm colors like red, yellow
and orange. ``When you walk into my house, you feel very relaxed,''
she says. ``I think it's the color. I like to send a message with
color.''
</P>
<P>
   In her living room, there are patches of yellow and orange and
red everywhere _ in a chair covered with a paisley fabric, in a
carpet she found at the Tepper auction house, in the prints of
apples and oranges on the wall, in a batik cover over a corner
table. And especially, in a Majolica urn from Italy, from the
Victorian era, that is orange, yellow and green. ``I just like the
way it feels,'' she says. ``It looks happy.''
</P>
<P>
   People who are trying to figure out what colors they genuinely
like, and not what some style or fashion may dictate that they
like, should look for the one object in their home that makes them
happy, and then look at the colors, she says. If she were to pick
one thing in this apartment, it would be that urn.
</P>
<P>
   She has done little to the galley kitchen, except place her
toaster oven on one burner of the massive commercial-style Viking
stove. ``That's my level,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she doesn't entertain. There is a roof deck atop the
15-story building that is rarely used by the other tenants, and on
New Year's Eve and the Fourth of July she had parties there. ``It
was just spectacular,'' she says, because of the views of the
Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer, she has missed the garden she had in Connecticut,
but otherwise, leaving the suburbs was easy. ``It's a wonderful
life if you have children,'' she says. But later, it's not so
wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suburban life for a single woman was just deadly,'' she
says. ``In the city, you can do things by yourself. There doesn't
have to be that attachment factor.'' She has been divorced for 20
years, and with her three children all well into their 20s, it
seemed time to leave and move onto the next stage.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is a sign over her front door that says it all,
something that was left by the owner that suits her perfectly. It
says: ``Though no one can go back and make a brand new start,
anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending.''

ONLY ONE HEARTBEAT AWAY &HT;    By HELEN THOMAS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Suddenly the role of the vice president in the
November election has gotten everyone's attention.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the American electoral system has this odd quirk:
It empowers one man to pick a possible future U.S. president. The
presidential candidate doesn't ask the American voters or the
electoral college when he _ or, she (someday) _ selects a running
mate who may become president as a result of the death or removal
of the president. That's the way the system works and no one has
thought of a better way.
</P>
<P>
   Vice presidential succession isn't a far-fetched prospect. Since
I've been reporting on the Washington scene, three vice presidents
have become president through the succession process: Harry Truman
in 1945 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt suffered a fatal
stroke; Lyndon B. Johnson in 1963 when John F. Kennedy was
assassinated; and Gerald R. Ford in 1974 when Richard Nixon was
forced to resign as a result of the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it's startling that both Vice President Al Gore and
Texas Gov. George W. Bush picked their running mates for defensive
political reasons _ not necessarily because Gore and Bush thought
their vice presidential nominees would make the best presidents if
the need arose.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's pick of Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut apparently
was based on the senator's biggest claim to fame _ his withering
denunciation of President Clinton in 1998 when he branded his
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky as ``immoral
and harmful`` to the nation's children. With Lieberman at his side,
Gore hopes to blunt the Republican litany that Bush would restore
``dignity and honor, '' and oh, yes, ``decency'' to the Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
   So Lieberman, the stern moralist, joins the ticket as the voice
of righteousness, even though he and Gore have parted company in
the past on such issues as school vouchers and privatizing Social
Security. Lately, Lieberman has had a change of heart on school
vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, on the other hand, a johnny-come-lately in national
politics, was looking for ``gravitas'' in his running mate to
counter the perception that he lacks experience in domestic or
foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   So he chooses Richard Cheney, the low key former White House
chief of staff, six-term Wyoming congressman, secretary of defense
during the Persian Gulf War and, most recently, an oil industry
tycoon.
</P>
<P>
   Once fellow Republicans and the media took a look at Cheney's
voting record in the House, they were shocked. He voted ``no'' on
everything from gun control to making civil rights leader Martin
Luther King's birthday a national holiday. His stunning negative
votes on social programs displayed a lot of conservatism, but no
compassion, conflicting with Bush's political mantra of
``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Cheney also avoided the Vietnam war, later
explaining: ``I had other priorities.'' Another student in the
sixties. Lieberman also took a pass on the war.
</P>
<P>
   The one-man selection system of vice presidents has actually
served the nation well and each successor has risen to the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   When FDR chose Truman, a relatively unknown senator from
Missouri, he created a lot of hard feelings because he had first
indicated to several prominent Democrats, including Supreme Court
Justice William O. Douglas and Secretary of State James Byrnes that
they were high on his list. Truman had the attractive
characteristic that he was not Vice President Henry Wallace, the
liberal who was anathema to the politicians in the smoke-filled
rooms in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, no one has matched the sanitized description of the
vice presidency as a ``warm bucket of spit'', which was uttered by
John Garner, the vice president in Roosevelt's first two terms. One
of the big surprises in the history of vice presidential choices
came at the 1960 Democratic convention in Los Angeles where John F.
Kennedy asked Lyndon B. Johnson to be his running mate. At the
time, Johnson was Kennedy's chief rival for the presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   As rumors spread that Kennedy would offer Johnson the No. 2 spot
on the ticket, the Texas delegation, headed by Speaker Sam Rayburn,
urged him not to accept it. Lady Bird Johnson also told her husband
to turn it down. The Texans were furious with the hard-ball
politics being played by the Kennedy clan after Kennedy had the
nomination nearly locked up before the convention began.
</P>
<P>
   When Kennedy decided that Johnson was the best man to help the
Democratic ticket in the South, he summoned Rayburn to his suite to
inform him of his choice. Rayburn balked, telling Kennedy that
Johnson would prefer to remain in the Senate as the majority
leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes you think, he will stay in the leadership,''
Kennedy asked the Speaker. The warning was clear. Rayburn went to
Johnson and told him he had to accept Kennedy's offer to be his
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson protested, saying, ``Yesterday, you told me not to take
it. What happened?.'' Rayburn's classic reply: ``I'm a much smarter
man today.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Johnson was not easily appeased. When the Texas delegation
gathered in the Johnson suite, as recalled by George Reedy,
Johnson's first press secretary, Johnson poked his finger at his
wife and told her: ``Don't you know, I'll be one heart beat away
from the presidency?''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson chafed under his loss of political power as vice
president. He was even more discomfited by the continual rumors
that Bobby Kennedy had started a ``dump Johnson'' movement to
remove him from Kennedy's reelection ticket in 1964. The rest is
history.
</P>
<P>
   When his turn came, Johnson also dangled the No. 2 spot to
several hopeful politicos who were summoned to the Oval Office. All
the while, he fully intended to offer it to Sen. Hubert Humphrey of
Minnesota. When he did, he told the senator: ``You know you're not
going to be anything but a (expletive deleted) messenger boy around
here.''
</P>
<P>
   No one ever accused LBJ of tact _ but no one ever doubted his
political smarts.

TIBOR KALMAN: SEEING, DISBELIEVING 
</HEADLINE>
   By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since Tibor Kalman was a friend of mine, I'm not able to write
an objective review of ``Tiborocity: Design and Undesign by Tibor
Kalman'' the New Museum of Contemporary Art's lively retrospective
of the late graphic designer's work. But I'd feel idiotic if I
didn't write a personal story before the show comes down, this
weekend. ``Tiborocity'' had me shadowboxing with my friend, who
died last year, over some of the issues we used to argue about.
What is sensibility? What is visual culture? How do you maintain or
even measure integrity in the consumer society? Those are a few of
the issues we didn't exhaust in Tibor's lifetime. Continuing the
conversation is my way of remembering him.
</P>
<P>
   Tibor was an artist of the distribution system _ the economic
framework that bridges the gap between production and consumption.
His metier encompassed art direction, graphic and product design,
corporate branding, and exhibition display. M&AMP;Co, his New York
studio, achieved high visibility with designs for Artforum and
Interview magazines; CD covers for the Talking Heads and Laurie
Anderson; brochures for Red Square, an East Village apartment
building; and, perhaps most memorably, a line of Surrealistic
watches and clocks. The tone throughout was satirical, a lightly
mocking wit deployed against design, against the consumer, against
the trendiness embodied by M&AMP;Co and its clients.
</P>
<P>
   Since we live in an era dominated by distribution, Tibor's work
was intrinsically provocative, for how can art exist within it?
Art, even Andy Warhol's, deals with truth, with the difference
between life as it is and as we would like it to be. Distribution
techniques _ advertising, graphic design, commercial photography,
public relations, store display _ traffic in distortion and the
exploitation of hope. That pill is not going to help you lose
weight. You know this perfectly well. So does the manufacturer. The
principal function of the distribution system is to loosen our
mutual grip on reality.
</P>
<P>
   Tibor and I both started out as window dressers. His windows
(for the company that evolved into Barnes &AMP; Noble) featured books.
Mine (for a shop called Design Research) showcased classic modern
design. Our later paths led us toward the reverse of our respective
displays. But the opposites remained conjoined. I write about the
world of visual appearances. Tibor's designs often featured words.
</P>
<P>
   A conflict between word and image initially brought us together.
In 1985, Tibor was hired as the art director for Artforum magazine.
I wrote the magazine's architecture column. The magazine already
had a reputation for creating great layouts at the expense of
writing. Tibor pushed this to an extreme. For his first issue, he
had the notion of isolating random letters throughout the text and
printing them in light blue instead of black. In my column, the
letter ``e'' was chosen for this transformation. Since it made the
text nearly unreadable, I naturally saw his fiddling as a sign of
disrespect.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, I can see that Tibor was giving tit for tat. Oscar
Wilde said, ``The primary aim of the critic is to see the object as
in itself it really is not.'' Why shouldn't design return the
favor? Why not art-direct a poor critic's column out of
recognition?
</P>
<P>
   Like others who started out in the late 1960s, Tibor had a
complicated relationship to authority. The counterculture, which
many baby boomers saw as a bright beginning, came to a messy end.
The last gasp of 19th-century Romanticism, it marked the
dissipation of Romantic attitudes from a cultural elite to every
adolescent's natural rite of passage. Rebellion became generic.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the new media and information industries represented
the rebirth of countercultural thinking in mainstream form. You
really do have to Think Different to navigate the Web. You can
create an entire worldview from a laptop. Point of view,
sensibility, radiance can be transmitted worldwide. Tibor mainly
worked in traditional media. Essentially a graphic designer, most
of his output consisted of magazines, record and CD covers and
print and TV ads, with the occasional foray into product design and
even urban design. Still, he was a McLuhan child, a global villager
who regarded media as a consciousness-raising device and advocated
liberation from the linear authority of print culture.
</P>
<P>
   The show suggests that Tibor's medium was as much tactile as
visual. He traded in textures of thought: shapes, colors, stylistic
periods, atmospheres rubbing one another like subway riders. Think
of his umbrella lined with a blue sky, a Magritte pret-a-porter,
the Surrealist icon made democratic and practical.
</P>
<P>
   The closest I ever came to having a Christmas fruitcake each
year from a maiden auntie was the holiday gift that arrived
annually from Tibor's company. These tended to have socially
uplifting themes. One year it would be a medicine cabinet in the
shape of a red cross. Another year it would be a secondhand book
stuffed with paper money. Included were envelopes, preaddressed to
charities. (I spent the dough on myself.)
</P>
<P>
   I took professional interest in Tibor's work for the 42nd Street
Redevelopment Authority. Along with Robert A.M. Stern, Tibor was
instrumental in creating the so-called interim plan, a set of
guidelines governing the look of storefronts, signage and other
elements in the rebuilding of Times Square. Besides contributing
ideas, Tibor designed an immense sidewalk installation for south
side of 42nd Street on the short block between Broadway and Seventh
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``Everybody,'' the project, designed with Scott Stowell,
crystallized Tibor's aspirations for the revamped Crossroads of the
World: socially inclusive, focused on the street, Surrealist in
spirit. The major element was a large billboard, mounted just above
sidewalk level. The word ``Everybody'' was spelled out in black
letters against a background of school-bus yellow. Attached to the
billboard was a small assortment of funky chairs. These could be
reached by climbing a set of ziggurat-shaped bleachers. When
seated, you gazed out on the Midtown circus with your feet dangling
in air.
</P>
<P>
   The project revolved, if just intuitively, around Surrealism's
two intellectual poles: Freudian dream space (the slight elevation
above street level evokes the loss of gravity, the low-altitude
flight of dreaming hysterics), and Marxian social justice (the
place serves the people, not the other way around). The school-bus
yellow was itself a major component of the sign: Tibor's was
largely an educational sensibility. He loved to absorb and to
share.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   All these things come across very clearly throughout the New
Museum exhibition. The show displays the range of artifacts Tibor
collected, and his designs expressed the fusion of his references.
Generosity and humility, more than political consciousness, were
the transforming agents in his creative process. Perhaps the
capacity to learn in public is the active ingredient in the
creative sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   The worst betrayal anyone can commit in my eyes is to move to
Italy and leave me behind. So I was not disposed to forgive Tibor
for accepting an offer to go to Rome as the editor of Colors, an
advertorial magazine put out by Benetton, the clothing
manufacturer. Nor was I inclined to like the magazine. I've never
liked Benetton's clothes.
</P>
<P>
   But I could see how frustrating it was for Tibor to design a
magazine without exercising creative control over it. And I could
also see the appeal of this particular magazine. There aren't many
publications out there that draw a firm line between advertising
and editorial. So it was disarming to come upon a magazine that was
entirely upfront about being an ad. Still, Colors was an ad. It
skewed the contract between the editor and the audience.
</P>
<P>
   I confess that in my memory the magazine is largely a blur. Only
a few images stand out from it, like those depicting Queen
Elizabeth II as a dark-skinned, tropical monarch and Spike Lee as
white-skinned suburban hip-hop devotee.
</P>
<P>
   Tibor's magazine led him deeper and deeper into his own
contradictions. That is what was so great about it. Unfortunately,
it didn't give him space or time to work them out. These conflicts
stemmed from the same problem: visual culture is a contradiction in
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Visual literacy once seemed like a liberating concept _ a
release from the musty weight of history, books, linear thinking
and the print tradition that McLuhan had consigned to history's
dustbin. Images, and the prospect of communicating through images
alone, offered the hope of changing consciousness. It was a logical
repository for the counterculture's universalist ideals.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1980s, however, it had become clear that these
ambitions could not be attained by instinct alone. A more analytic,
historically informed approach was needed to prevent visual culture
from degenerating into a cult of ignorance and commercial
manipulation. One afternoon, when Tibor and I were wandering
through the splendors of Baroque Rome, I wondered whether he and I
were seeing the same thing. Here was the most extravagant display
of visual culture staged by Western civilization. Did Tibor get the
Baroque message? All was possible, all could be questioned,
provided that you accepted the absolute authority of the church.
Sculptures, fountains, urban vistas, murals, buildings _ the most
sumptuous entertainments would be provided for those who
surrendered their souls to the Father.
</P>
<P>
   In Tibor's magazine, every social injustice could be exposed,
every authority mocked _ provided you flew the United Colors of
Benetton. Every image was permissible, every pictorial
juxtaposition would be laid out, provided you saluted the flag of
visual culture. Which I did not. It had become the banner of the
consumer society, a system as authoritarian as that of 17th-century
Rome.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after seeing the show, I was talking with Tod
Williams, the 31-year-old director of the critically acclaimed
movie ``The Adventures of Sebastian Cole.'' He told me, ``For my
generation, images are garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   I had to laugh. What made the comment so devastating is that
proponents of visual culture were always playing the generation
card. They exploited adolescent illiteracy for self-serving ends.
The notion of visual culture justified their own lack of
cultivation (why read?) while giving them a sense of moral purpose
(as teachers of visual literacy). In one breath, they announced:
``The future belongs to the imagists, and ... let's do it for the
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   These two dubious messages provided the slim intellectual
content of Colors No. 13, the last issue Tibor edited before
returning to New York. This provocative number contained pages of
pictures and one page of text. These were agreeably laid out. A
nice album of pix. A stylebook of personal adornment (tattoos,
makeup, eyeglass frames); of erotic and violent encounters (mating
carrots, a car crash). Rows of toes next to rows of noses. Blood.
Variety meats. Surgery. At the end, a confused editorial argued
that the editors didn't really think that pictures were more
truthful, but somehow they were. Words to that effect. Then a
suggestion that if you've wasted time reading the editorial you owe
it to yourself to go back and stare at a picture for the same
length of time, etc.
</P>
<P>
   After my conversation with Tod Williams, I thought, yes, issue
No. 13 was basically a load of garbage. The editorial was trashy,
too. It said: ``Look at my garbage. Don't like what you see? Look
again. Harder.'' And it was generational garbage. A baby boomer was
saying to his younger audience: ``Here, take our priceless garbage.
We give it to you _ the leaders of the 21st century. Yours to
cherish. Yours to adore.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I don't think that images are garbage. I doubt very
much that a filmmaker like Tod Williams does, either. People like
us must be scopophiliacs to do what we do. But visual culture per
se is not a visual phenomenon. It has barely a glancing
relationship to aesthetics in any form. Rather, it is a social,
psychological, political and, above all, an economic manifestation.
To be visually literate, in any but the most superficial
consumerist fashion, you have to tear aside the screen of images
and locate the nonvisual factors that are running the show.
</P>
<P>
   My hunch is that, if Tibor's life hadn't been cut short, he
would have done just that. He would have had a commercially
successful way to educate people about the many facets of
visuality. We would all be hooked on Tibor.com, where we would find
combined access to the most extraordinary array of images and the
most dazzling written insights into the visual apparatus. We would
have Avedon's ``Dovima With Elephants'' along with commentaries on
it by Arthur Danto and Janet Malcolm. We could download entire
libraries of the greats illustrated with before-and-after pictures
of cosmetic makeovers. In other words, Tibor would return to
showcasing books.

 &HT;    RUSSIA ACCEPTS HELP FROM BRITISH IN RESCUING SAILORS TRAPPED ON
SUB
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A British rescue team is expected to begin a long
voyage Thursday to assist a stranded Russian submarine amid fears
that they may arrive too late to save the lives of 118 crewmembers
trapped in the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   A flurry of activity Wednesday _ including a reluctant call by
Russian officials for foreign assistance _ came after the only sign
of life from the submarine fell silent. For days Russian officials
have reported hearing tapping against the Kursk's hull, but the
sounds ceased Wednesday, suggesting the worst for the crew aboard
the submarine some 350 feet below the surface of the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   However, Russian officials insisted that this didn't mean the
crew had perished. Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov told the
Interfax news agency that this could be a sign that the crew was
attempting to conserve oxygen. ``There is no sign of life,''
Klebanov said. ``But from this it is not necessary to conclude
something terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian Navy Commander Vladimir Kuroyedov said the crew might
have stopped tapping because the sailors knew rescuers were on the
way. ``One needs to take into account the mentality of submarine
officers,'' Kuroyedov said. ``Once they knew rescue capsules were
above them, they maintained silence.''
</P>
<P>
   The 20-member British team is expected to leave Trondheim,
Norway, Thursday morning for the 900-mile trip to the rescue site
in the Arctic Circle. The trip could take until Saturday evening _
the day after Russian officials have said the oxygen supply aboard
the Kursk would be depleted.
</P>
<P>
   However, a Russian admiral said Wednesday that the massive
Oscar-2 class submarine could have enough oxygen to sustain the
crew as long as another week.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the mini-sub, Britain dispatched to the site
three Hercules jets loaded with equipment and a navy survey vessel,
a British defense ministry spokesman said. Norway also sent a ship
with around a dozen civilian divers.
</P>
<P>
   Once at the site, the British team would within hours send down
its LR5 mini-submarine. Once the mini-sub links with the Kursk it
will be able to transport to the surface up to 16 people at a time.
It would take an additional 24 hours to recover all the
crewmembers, the Navy said.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue could be hampered if LR5's rescue hatch turns out to
be incompatible with the submarine's hatch. Russian and British
officials expect to meet Thursday to review such technical issues.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dire circumstances, the British rescue team's leader
told reporters he had not lost hope. ``We would not be going unless
we thought there was something positive we could do,'' said
Commodore Tim Chittenden.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials who had initially refused to ask for foreign
assistance officially asked for help Wednesday, five days after the
submarine sank to the floor of the Barents Sea near Norway, which
shares an Arctic border with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   British officials said their rescue team had been preparing for
the call for days. The submarine foundered Saturday, apparently
after an explosion that followed the launch of a torpedo during a
training mission. The alarm was sounded after the Kursk failed to
make a scheduled radio contact Saturday and it was found Sunday,
Navy officials told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Navy submarine monitoring Russian naval exercises in the
area heard an explosion Saturday that appeared linked to the Kursk,
U.S. officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Russian officials officially requested foreign
assistance, the British team took off from an airfield in Scotland
with the LR5 aboard a giant Russian transport and arrived in Norway
in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute decision to accept aid _ which was offered on
Monday _ could open authorities to criticism that national pride
prevented them from calling for help sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Vladislav Ilyin, deputy chief of staff of the Russian Navy, said
on Russian television that President Vladimir Putin gave the order
``to accept help wherever it comes from'' after a 30-minute
telephone conversation with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, on vacation in a Black Sea resort since the crisis began,
made his first public statement and defended the rescue effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the moment it became clear that something had happened,
all necessary and possible efforts to save the craft and its crew
have been carried out,'' he said in a television appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately the weather is very bad. A storm has raged for
two days, and sailors could not use all the means at their
disposal,'' he said. He described the situation as ``critical.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the navy established a hotline for relatives of
crewmembers, many of whom flew Wednesday to the submarine's base on
the Arctic Ocean. They were quartered on a boat that will put to
sea to greet the sailors _ if any are rescued.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian rescue capsules, operated by a crew of three or
four, can rescue up to 20 men at a time. But they have been unable
to dock with a cargo hold in the rear of the Kursk, which is tilted
60 degrees on the sea floor in waters with strong currents and low
visibility.
</P>
<P>
   The British LR5 minisub has never been used in a real rescue,
but was designed for just such a life-or-death situation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES \A'' It was your typical Democratic National
Convention fund-raiser, under glittering chandeliers in a hotel
ballroom, with candidates in full cry at the podium and 1,000
well-dressed guests who paid $250 each for their cold chicken and
see themselves as big-league political power players.
</P>
<P>
   And they are. They hand-pick candidates, train them, supply them
with expert campaign staff, mobilize voters and deliver cash \A''
lots of cash. They put people in office.
</P>
<P>
   They are almost all women, from the candidates on the platform
to the check-writers in the audience \A'' the women of Emily's
List.
</P>
<P>
   The feminist political fund-raising organization that began as
one woman with an idea and a Rolodex in her basement has grown in
15 years into ``the biggest funder of federal candidates in the
country,'' according to founder Ellen Malcolm.
</P>
<P>
   Emily's List backs only pro-choice Democratic women candidates
running for congressional or gubernatorial office. With 60,000
members nationwide, the group can pump more than $1 million in
contributions to a candidate. The political action committee of
Emily's List has more financial muscle than the Teamsters Union.
About 10 percent of Emily's List contributors are men.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now a real financial powerhouse and obviously that's
translating into a historic number of wins for women candidates,''
Malcolm said with pride.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is all around here in California. Malcolm welcomed
to the platform a succession of women elected with the help of
Emily's List money, including both of the state's senators, Dianne
Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, one of the
state's 12 women members of the House. Pelosi could become the
majority whip next year if the Democrats regain control of the
chamber this November.
</P>
<P>
   Operating with a budget this election cycle of $28 million and a
staff of 41, Emily's List is backing 24 women so far this year.
Their marquee candidates are Hillary Rodham Clinton, running for
senator in New York, and Debbie Stabenow, who is seeking a Senate
seat in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Emily's List is ``very important and very effective,'' said
Democratic National Chairman Edward Rendell.
</P>
<P>
   In the battle to control the House, only 12 Democrats have been
able to raise more than $1 million so far, and eight of them are
women who are receiving Emily's List backing.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me it's just a delight to see these women run in these
tough races and come out the winner,'' Malcolm said. ``We've never
been able to do that before. We've made history in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always that way, of course. When she began the
organization, Malcolm recalls, it was common for the men who
dominated the Democratic Party to deny funding to women who wanted
to run for office on grounds that they were not viable candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they wouldn't give them any money, the women couldn't
become viable candidates, so they were really trapped in this
vicious circle,'' Malcolm said. ``Emily raises early money for
women because our strategy was that if we could get them started
and put some money in the bank and get them a poll, they could
convince the old boys that they were viable candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked. In the seven elections since Emily was founded, the
group has helped elect seven Democratic women senators, 49 members
of Congress and three female governors.
</P>
<P>
   The organization takes its name from a political slogan: Early
Money Is Like Yeast. (It makes dough rise.)
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I wondered who Emily was,'' laughed Pat Rich of
Beverly Hills, who became a member of the group five years ago.
``Who's the martyr we're named after, the poor, downtrodden `Emily'
victimized by the Republicans?''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Wright of Los Angeles said she is an Emily's List member
because the organization ``focuses on all the issues that matter to
women: abortion, guns, children.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Duff, a longtime activist from New York, said the
``smartest thing'' Emily's List did was broaden its role in 1994 to
include voter mobilization efforts targeting women with special
mailings and telephone outreach, in addition to fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi said the success of Emily's List may make it possible to
double the number of women in Congress by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Women have three vital interests in this year's presidential
election, according to Boxer: ``The Supreme Court, the Supreme
Court and the Supreme Court.'' She was talking about the
probability that the next president will appoint one or more new
Supreme Court justices during his tenure, changing the narrow
five-to-four majority that now upholds abortion rights for women.
</P>
<P>
   Republican George W. Bush is firmly opposed to abortion and his
party's platform calls for the appointment of judges who would ban
all abortions, though Bush has said he would not apply such a
litmus test to his judicial appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Al Gore supports abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democrats are worried because Bush leads Gore among
women in most polls, a reversal of the trend in past elections when
Republicans suffered from a so-called gender gap among women
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to be concerned about the Democrats, the big
question is whether the women are coming back or not,'' said Robert
Strauss, a former Democratic national chairman. ``That's Gore's
problem, the women's vote. Is he going to be able to get it back?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and the Democrats need not worry too much, according to
Malcolm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters are just bouncing around right now,'' she said. ``Women
think George W. Bush seems like a nice fellow and maybe they'll
vote for him. But when they really start focusing on their
decision, they're going to look at the issues, see who they agree
with and who they don't, and who is the leader who is going to take
the people forward. We're going to see a big shift. Women are going
to come back to the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   The big test ahead for Emily's List is whether it can deliver on
that promise.

 &HT;    ANN RICHARDS' CONVENTION FROM ON HIGH
 &HT;    By DAVE McNEELY
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you're looking for former Gov. Ann Richards of
Texas at the Democratic National Convention here, you're better off
watching CNN than dogging the Texas delegation meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The woman who keynoted the 1988 Democratic convention in Atlanta
and chaired the 1992 convention in New York was on CNN's ``Larry
King Live'' show late Tuesday evening, paired with Bill Bennett,
who was President Bush's drug czar and Ronald Reagan's education
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Richards, who will be 68 on Sept. 1, was there to give the
perspective of a former Democratic elected official on the
convention. After four years as governor, she was beaten for
re-election in 1994 by George W. Bush, now the GOP nominee for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Richards called President Clinton's convention speech Monday _
and his administration _ the best she has ever seen. Bennett
replied that Clinton should have addressed lying about his affairs
in the White House, which make him ``a felon.''
</P>
<P>
   Richards chided Bennett for holding grudges, saying she both
bestows and has needed forgiveness. People have flaws, and so do
their leaders, Richards said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman who in 1988 said of Bush's father, ``Poor George _ he
can't help it _ he was born with a silver foot in his mouth'' said
Vice President Al Gore's speech Thursday night ``is the most
important speech that I have seen in my lifetime at conventions.''
</P>
<P>
   While conventions are now largely staged affairs, the
presidential nominee's acceptance speech ``does give the candidate
an opportunity to set before the public _ uninterrupted _ their
vision and their ideas about what they're going to do in the
country,'' Richards said in an interview outside the CNN anchor
booth at the Staples Center here.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Gore nor Bush can hope to compete with Clinton as a
speaker, Richards said. But if Gore is to have any chance of
beating Bush, he must use the speech tonight to seem presidential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton has built a bridge to the 21st century,''
Richards said, borrowing a line Clinton emphasized over and over in
his 1996 acceptance speech. ``Al Gore's going to have to walk
across that bridge. And when he gets to the other side, he's going
to have to look like a president. And how well he does is going to
shape the rest of this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   What does she think about the man who unseated her?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I say to everyone that I could spend 24 hours of every
day responding to people who think I'm going to give them some
special insight into George Bush,'' Richards drawled.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, he is my governor, of my home state. And as a
consequence, it is inappropriate for me, because I have bias, to
comment on him or his performance,'' Richards said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what I want them to know is that they already know _ they
already know _ everything there is to know about George Bush.
There's no mystery here. There's no depths to plumb. And I tell
'em, `Trust your instinct. Because what you think now is accurate,'
'' she said with a low chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Richards these days splits her time between high-dollar
Washington lobbying for the Washington law firm of Verner Liipfert
on behalf of high-dollar clients, including tobacco companies, and
making speeches, many of them gratis fund-raising appearances for
Democratic office-holders and candidates.
</P>
<P>
   She made her CNN appearances during the Republican National
Convention by remote hookup from Washington. But she is here in
person, seeing old friends like former Vice President Walter
Mondale, and even son-in-law Kirk Adams, a Washington-based
national labor organizer.
</P>
<P>
   Both before and after her 15-minute TV stint Tuesday, standing
in the halls outside the CNN skybox anchor booth, Richards is
interrupted every few seconds by an awe-struck, often reverential
well-wisher _ most of them wishing to get their pictures taken with
her. Richards readily obliges.
</P>
<P>
   Richards, sometimes besieged in the past by the news media,
isn't giving many interviews, other than with King. She says her
contract with CNN prevents it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm contracted out,'' Richards said, smiling. ``Isn't it
good?'' she added, and walked away, chuckling.

 &HT;    A refreshing dive into some of Florida's freshest, coolest
waters

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _
</P>
<P>
   GINNIE SPRINGS
</P>
<P>
   7300 N. E. Ginnie Springs Road, High Springs. Phone: (904)
454-2202.
</P>
<P>
   How big is the boil? A second-magnitude spring, Ginnie has a
flow of 29 million gallons per day.
</P>
<P>
   Average water temperature: 72 degrees
</P>
<P>
   Our view: While kids floated in bright-colored inner tubes and
boats, divers searched the caves below. We could see the bubbles
from the air tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Ginnie Springs is an extremely pretty place, with its turquoise
waters and its shady campgrounds. It's easy to understand why
divers from all over the world come here.
</P>
<P>
   You actually get seven springs for the price of one (Deer, Twin,
Dogwood, Ginnie and three that are part of the Devil Spring
system). All of them dot the Santa Fe River. The clear, blue spring
water provides a stark contrast to the dark, tannin-stained river.
When the two mix, as they do at the river's edge, the results are
spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting fact: More divers learn to cavern and cave dive at
Ginnie Springs than anywhere else, according to the Ginnie Springs
Web site. Be warned: If you want to explore the caves, you must be
certified. Cave diving can be dangerous. At least 27 divers have
lost their lives here.
</P>
<P>
   Activities: Swimming, diving, tubing, canoeing, kayaking,
hiking, camping, picnicking.
</P>
<P>
   Admission: $7 per person, per day.
</P>
<P>
   HOMOSASSA SPRINGS
</P>
<P>
   4150 S. Suncoast Blvd, Homosassa. Phone: (352) 628-5343.
</P>
<P>
   How big is the boil? A first-magnitude spring, Homosassa has a
flow of 113.8 million gallons per day
</P>
<P>
   Average water temperature: 75 degrees
</P>
<P>
   Our view: Unless you swim with them, you're probably not going
to get any closer to a manatee than you will inside the ``fish
bowl,'' a sort of reverse aquarium. The bowl allows visitors to go
below the surface of the water and watch the manatees as they munch
on carrots and lettuce and swim inches away from the glass windows.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also see turtles and a variety of saltwater and
freshwater fish that can travel unrestricted between the headwaters
and the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Also fun: the zoo, which features a 40-year-old hippo, a couple
of American bald eagles, a silver fox, a Florida black bear,
alligators galore, lots of flamingos and other birds.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting fact: The park is a rehabilitation center and refuge
for endangered West Indian manatees that have been orphaned or
injured in the wild. Most of the birds and animals living at
Homosassa could not survive in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   Activities: Educational programs about manatee, alligators, and
wildlife encounters. Picnicking, hiking.
</P>
<P>
   Admission: $7.95 for adults (age 13 and over), $ 4.95 for
children ages 3 through 12; free for kids under 3. Average water
temperature: 72 degrees
</P>
<P>
   Our view: Surrounded by cypress, gum, ash, and maple trees,
Manatee Springs is an ideal place for canoe rides.
</P>
<P>
   The morning we visited, the swimming area was beginning to fill
with children and their mothers. A trio of moms were doing some
serious toe-dipping and then retreating up the stairs to warm up on
the park benches. The kids didn't seem to mind a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting fact: Located on the Suwannee River just 23 miles
upstream from the Gulf of Mexico, the park consists of 2,075 acres.
It opened to the public in 1955. At this spring, you need to visit
in fall or winter months to see the manatee.
</P>
<P>
   Activities: Picnicking, fishing, swimming, canoeing, hiking and
biking on the 8.5-mile north end trail system, scuba diving, nature
study and camping.
</P>
<P>
   Admission: $3.25 per vehicle.

<P>
   POE SPRINGS
</P>
<P>
   28800 N.W. 182 Ave., High Springs. Phture: 76 degrees
</P>
<P>
   Our view: In 1859, an archaeologist, John LeConte, wrote that
the most remarkable feature of this place was ``the truly
extraordinary transparency of the water ... surpassing anything
which can be imagined.'' His assessment holds true today, not only
for Silver Springs, but all of the springs we visited.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, swimming is allowed only on weekends. And,
since we arrived on a Friday, we spent the day trough the gardens
and the petting zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Local legend has it that if people have their picture taken
standing surrounded by the trunk of the horseshoe palm tree at the
water's edge, they wour pockets and posed with the lucky tree. (No
winners, to date, but we have have our fingers crossed.)
</P>
<P>
   Interesting facts: The glass-bottom boat, invented in 1878 by
Hullam Jones, made its debut here in 1910 and has been a popular
attraction ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Johnnie Weismuller came here to film Tarzan movies. But he
wasn't the only star to work in Silver Springs. Others include
Gregory Peck and Jane Wyman for Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings' ``Tper
for ``Distant Drums,'' and Lloyd Bridges for more than 100 episodes
of ``Sea Hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Activities: Reptile shows, boat rides,akulla Springs, 32305.
Phone: (850) 224-5950.

<P>
   How big is the boil? A first-magnitude spring, Wakulla has a
flow of 252 million gallons per day.
</P>
<P>
   Average water temperature: 73 degrees
</P>
<P>
   Our view: Tarzan movies were filmed here and Old Joe (a 1d in
the lodge. There's a great swimming hole, diving ramps, and a 1937
lodge with marble floors, an ornate lobby ceiling, antique
furniture and what looks like one of the first elevators ever made.

<P>
   After the guide hollered out to the reel star, (Hen-REEEEE!) we
watched as the black bass, less than a foot long, sailed out and
flopped over a cypress pole several feet under water. Henr
Interesting fact: Wakulla has been a tourist favorite since the
1930s. The park has the world's largest and deepest freshwater
springs and is surrounded by 3,000 acres of virgin forest. Ponce de
Leon discovered the springs in 1513 and thought it was the fountain
of youth.

   Interesting fact: Warm Mineral Springs, which is listed in the
National Register of Historic Ppopcorn, but played the tambourine
during the performance and made sure kids weren't clogging up the
stairways. On the other side of the glass, the mermaids swam and
lip-synched to recorded songs, taking breaths of airr the
``geezer'' cruise, as I like to call it. Our grandfatherly guide,
with his Rodney Dangerfield delivery, told silly jokes that fell on
mostly deaf ears because most of the passengers were kids or from
foreign countries. You had to be over 45 to get his punch lines.
But more than the funny old man, the cruise was a delight because
pelicans and egrets guided the boat down the rivem were healthy,
but we saw some wounded guys, as well, at the pelican orphanage.

 &HT;    RUSSIA ACCEPTS HELP FROM BRITISH IN RESCUING SAILORS TRAPPED ON
SUB
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A British rescue team is expected to begin a long
voyage Thursday to assist a stranded Russian submarine amid fears
that they may arrive too late to save the lives of 118 crewmembers
trapped in the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   A flurry of activity Wednesday _ including a reluctant call by
Russian officials for foreign assistance _ came after the only sign
of life from the submarine fell silent. For days Russian officials
have reported hearing tapping against the Kursk's hull, but the
sounds ceased Wednesday, suggesting the worst for the crew aboard
the submarine some 350 feet below the surface of the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   However, Russian officials insisted that this didn't mean the
crew had perished. Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov told the
Interfax news agency that this could be a sign that the crew was
attempting to conserve oxygen. ``There is no sign of life,''
Klebanov said. ``But from this it is not necessary to conclude
something terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian Navy Commander Vladimir Kuroyedov said the crew might
have stopped tapping because the sailors knew rescuers were on the
way. ``One needs to take into account the mentality of submarine
officers,'' Kuroyedov said. ``Once they knew rescue capsules were
above them, they maintained silence.''
</P>
<P>
   The 20-member British team is expected to leave Trondheim,
Norway, Thursday morning for the 900-mile trip to the rescue site
in the Arctic Circle. The trip could take until Saturday evening _
the day after Russian officials have said the oxygen supply aboard
the Kursk would be depleted.
</P>
<P>
   However, a Russian admiral said Wednesday that the massive
Oscar-2 class submarine could have enough oxygen to sustain the
crew as long as another week.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the mini-sub, Britain dispatched to the site
three Hercules jets loaded with equipment and a navy survey vessel,
a British defense ministry spokesman said. Norway also sent a ship
with around a dozen civilian divers.
</P>
<P>
   Once at the site, the British team would within hours send down
its LR5 mini-submarine. Once the mini-sub links with the Kursk it
will be able to transport to the surface up to 16 people at a time.
It would take an additional 24 hours to recover all the
crewmembers, the Navy said.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue could be hampered if LR5's rescue hatch turns out to
be incompatible with the submarine's hatch. Russian and British
officials expect to meet Thursday to review such technical issues.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dire circumstances, the British rescue team's leader
told reporters he had not lost hope. ``We would not be going unless
we thought there was something positive we could do,'' said
Commodore Tim Chittenden.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials who had initially refused to ask for foreign
assistance officially asked for help Wednesday, five days after the
submarine sank to the floor of the Barents Sea near Norway, which
shares an Arctic border with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   British officials said their rescue team had been preparing for
the call for days. The submarine foundered Saturday, apparently
after an explosion that followed the launch of a torpedo during a
training mission. The alarm was sounded after the Kursk failed to
make a scheduled radio contact Saturday and it was found Sunday,
Navy officials told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Navy submarine monitoring Russian naval exercises in the
area heard an explosion Saturday that appeared linked to the Kursk,
U.S. officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Russian officials officially requested foreign
assistance, the British team took off from an airfield in Scotland
with the LR5 aboard a giant Russian transport and arrived in Norway
in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute decision to accept aid _ which was offered on
Monday _ could open authorities to criticism that national pride
prevented them from calling for help sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Vladislav Ilyin, deputy chief of staff of the Russian Navy, said
on Russian television that President Vladimir Putin gave the order
``to accept help wherever it comes from'' after a 30-minute
telephone conversation with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, on vacation in a Black Sea resort since the crisis began,
made his first public statement and defended the rescue effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the moment it became clear that something had happened,
all necessary and possible efforts to save the craft and its crew
have been carried out,'' he said in a television appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately the weather is very bad. A storm has raged for
two days, and sailors could not use all the means at their
disposal,'' he said. He described the situation as ``critical.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the navy established a hotline for relatives of
crewmembers, many of whom flew Wednesday to the submarine's base on
the Arctic Ocean. They were quartered on a boat that will put to
sea to greet the sailors _ if any are rescued.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian rescue capsules, operated by a crew of three or
four, can rescue up to 20 men at a time. But they have been unable
to dock with a cargo hold in the rear of the Kursk, which is tilted
60 degrees on the sea floor in waters with strong currents and low
visibility.
</P>
<P>
   The British LR5 minisub has never been used in a real rescue,
but was designed for just such a life-or-death situation.

IN ONLINE AUCTIONS OF THE FUTURE, IT'LL BE BOT VS. BOT VS. BOT 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANNE EISENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are called shopbots, buybots, pricebots or just plain bots
_ the ``bot'' is short for robot.
</P>
<P>
   The name is playful, but the reality is all business because
shopbots are meant to roam the Web all by themselves one day,
efficiently buying and selling goods and services for people and
companies.
</P>
<P>
   An infinite number of shopbots, each a piece of software, are
expected to show up as electronic commerce expands. One of the more
conservative estimates is that there will be hundreds of millions
of them.
</P>
<P>
   They will resemble today's relatively simple consumer shopbots,
personalized computer programs that bid on buyers' behalf at
auctions or go out on the Web to find the best prices on jeans, but
they will be far smarter and faster.
</P>
<P>
   These autonomous agents, as they are known among the people who
create them, will be programmed to handle dozens of auctions rather
than just one, bidding simultaneously and juggling results not just
for the best buy for a single product, like paper, but for several
related goods _ for instance, a combination of paper, ink, binders
and printing press time.
</P>
<P>
   And the bots will do this in a way humans cannot, responding to
slight changes in prices in a fraction of a second.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many in the field predict that ordinary people and
businesses will have the ability to handle the complexities of
automated trading in an infinite combination of market situations,
like arranging vacations, assembling financial portfolios or
setting manufacturing schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Once unleashed, automated trading bots will probably cause many
changes in the business-to-business and consumer marketplaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a research program to ask how the world will look when
hundreds of billions of agents are running around,'' said Steve
White, a manager who directs research into such decentralized
software systems at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center in
Yorktown Heights, N.Y. ``We want to help IBM get there first with
software _ economic agents that can make pricing and buying
decisions for a business.''
</P>
<P>
   People in both research and business are thinking about the
economics of shopbots, writing software that will let the bots
learn from their mistakes and successes, and trying to anticipate
what Web business will be like when shopbots are crawling all over
the sites.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is Michael Wellman, an automated-trading expert who
is a professor of computer science and engineering at the
University of Michigan. One of his approaches is more playful than
most.
</P>
<P>
   Wellman decided that a game was a good way to encourage
researchers to focus on the problems of shopbots and to share what
they have learned, an unusual step in the often proprietary world
of autonomous agents.
</P>
<P>
   So he and a colleague, Peter Wurman, a computer science
professor at North Carolina State University, organized a
competition for shopbots. The event was held last month at a
conference in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other scientists have competitions,'' Wellman said. ``Why not
us? This is the first competition of a complex trading scenario
with autonomous agents that we know of.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his colleagues set up trials involving that purgatory
familiar to any summer traveler: a plane trip. Competing software
programs would have to arrange round-trip airline tickets to Boston
along with hotel accommodations and entertainment: a Red Sox game,
a Boston Symphony concert or a performance of ``Phantom of the
Opera.'' And the shopbots had to find all of that at the best rates
for the entire package _ all deals were off, for example, if the
airline tickets were a bargain but all the hotel rooms were already
booked.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty teams of researchers from six countries participated,
trying to have their sophisticated programs outwit their
competitors' bots to line up the best trip. It was no simple matter
because there were separate auctions for all of the hotel and
airline reservations, complete with tricky rules that affected
prices. Pitfalls abounded. Only a limited number of hotel rooms
were available, for example, so a program that could not handle the
hotel auctions might leave its client without a place to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The winner was a team from AT&AMP;T Labs in Florham Park, N.J. The
team's leader, Peter Stone, a senior technical staff member,
attributed the victory to a flexible agent programmed to adapt
itself to different circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both increased the sophistication of our agent and imbued
it with the ability to adapt itself,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   It also turned out to be important to have the bots avoid a
pitfall familiar to many players of the stock market: irrational
exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agents tended to get unruly,'' said Michael Kearns, head
of the artificial intelligence department at AT&AMP;T and a member of
the winning AT&AMP;T team. They tended to raise their offers for what
they would pay based on what their competitors were doing rather
than on the value of what was being sold _ just as humans often do,
he added. ``We are all used to markets running amok not because of
the commodity, but because of the participants,'' Kearns said.
``One of the dangers is that the same thing will happen in digital
form.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other problems predicted when shopbots are unleashed,
and some involve privacy. It will be easy enough to waylay shopbots
on the Internet to find out, for instance, exactly what a buyer was
willing to spend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly if a program is trading on my behalf,'' said Yoav
Shoham, a professor at Stanford University and an expert in complex
online auctions, ``and I send it on the network, someone can
intercept the program and read my instructions, and that gives away
a lot.'' Shoham said those instructions could be encoded to deal
effectively with that security issue.
</P>
<P>
   A number of companies sponsored the shopbot competition in
Boston, among them IBM and Andersen Consulting. Doug Bryan, a
technology researcher at Andersen in Northbrook, Ill., said that
bots would soon start appearing in numbers on the marketplace so
the marketplace needed to get ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge to our customers _ we tend to represent big
sellers _ is to know what the bots can do,'' he said. Right now,
bots that simply go out and fetch price lists from the Web do not
make intelligent decisions about matching a buyer's needs with a
combination of offerings. ``That will change,'' Bryan said. ``And
businesses need to be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone, at AT&AMP;T Labs, has already noticed one effect bots can
have on price-conscious consumers. If people become angry at travel
agents who buy seats at what turn out to be prices that are too
high, consider their antagonism when a computer program makes that
kind of mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buyers tend to get more upset when it is software that makes
the decision, rather than a person,''' Stone said. ``It's the usual
Luddite instinct.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A warm front pushing to the east will cause showers and
thunderstorms across the southern Great Lakes Thursday. Flooding is
possible in areas with poor drainage because some showers will
carry bursts of heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
   Breezes from the north will direct cool air into much of the
Northeast. Readings will be as much as 10 degrees below normal.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeast will turn very hot as high pressure along the
northern Gulf Coast promotes abundant sunshine. Many locations from
East Texas to the central Gulf Coast states will exceed 100
degrees. Farther west, the remnants of Tropical Storm Beryl will be
drawn into southern Arizona and New Mexico. Cloudy skies and
numerous showers will be all that is left from this system.
</P>
<P>
   The northern Plains will turn cooler in the wake of a cold
front. The West Coast will stay mostly sunny and mild.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: CHICAGO'S SUMMER
</P>
<P>
   Summer finally arrived in Chicago on Tuesday when the mercury
rose above 90 degrees at O'Hare International Airport for the first
time this year. There has only been one summer, 1875, when the
temperature failed to reach 90. The last time the temperature
stayed below 90 for most of the summer was 1979, when the
temperature only rose to that level twice. Before 1958, the
official temperature in Chicago was taken much nearer the lakefront
and was not as influenced by the urban heat island, making the
summer of 2000 even cooler by comparison than it seems.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Life's a speech
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sen. Joe Lieberman officially steps into the national spotlight
tonight, to deliver what could well be the most important speech of
his life. His speech is expected to last less than 20 minutes,
after an introduction by his wife, Hadassah. The speech will first
touch on his personal experiences including his early involvement
in the civil rights struggle. He is expected to talk about the
country's progress in the last eight years, talk about the Al Gore
he knows and respects, and draw sharp distinctions between the
Gore-Lieberman team and the George W. Bush-Dick Cheney team. But
Lieberman said he would not play the traditional role of attack
dog: ``I've talked to Al about this, and we're very intent on
talking about progress, not partisanship. This is not going to be a
campaign of personal attack.''
</P>
<P>
   HUMANIZING GORE
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore arrived in Los Angeles this afternoon in time to hear
his eldest daughter _ 27-year-old Karenna Gore Schiff _ deliver a
deeply personal convention speech designed to introduce to the
nation the personal side of the vice president. While sipping
coffee with teachers in a suburban Detroit restaurant this morning,
Gore confessed to being very nervous about his daughter's speech:
``I've got more butterflies about that than my own speech,'' he
said. Gore has a relatively light schedule in Los Angeles. He will

   MCCAIN DIAGNOSED WITH SKIN CANCER
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain has been diagnosed with a recurrence of skin
cancer on his arm and temple, Republican officials said this
afternoon. McCain plans a news conference Friday to discuss his
medical condition. During his presidential campaign, McCain
released hundreds of pages of medical records that detailed the
lingering effects of injuries suffered in a Vietnam prisoner of war
camp. The records also showed that in December 1993, McCain had a
cancerous mole removed from his shoulder that proved to be
melanoma, the most dangerous form of skin cancer.

   LAPD'S BLUES
</P>
<P>
   Police are maintaining a pervasive presence throughout downtown
Los Angeles as demonstrators protested for a third day around the
convention today _ this time against police brutality and
corruption in the Police Department. Hundreds of activists marched
to a LAPD station at the center of a growing corruption scandal,
chanting: ``Racist, sexist, anti-gay, LAPD go away.'' To add to the
department's woes, the American Civil Liberties Union said it would
file a lawsuit today, accusing the LAPD of shooting innocent people
in the back with rubber bullets during Monday night's
confrontation.

   PERHAPS HE CAN SPEND THE TIME PRAYING THEY WIN

   For several crucial days right before the election, Joe
Lieberman will be sidelined from the campaign trail by religious
holidays. Rosh Hashanah (the Jewish New Year) falls on Sept. 30 and
Oct. 1. Yom Kippur (the day of atonement) falls on Oct. 9. Sukkot
(the Jewish harvest festival) arrives Oct. 14 and 15. Simchat Torah
(an annual celebration of finishing reading the Torah _ the word of
God _ and beginning again) comes on Oct. 22. Election Day is Nov.
7. ``Al Gore is a man of faith and he respects my faith and my
observance, and he's been very clear that he doesn't want me to
vary from my traditional practices, and I won't,'' Lieberman said.
Lieberman also observes the Jewish Sabbath, the traditional day for
worship and rest that stretches from sundown Friday to sundown
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICA FIRST
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of his religion, Joe Lieberman will favor U.S.
policies over those of Israel when they differ. ``My first and only
loyalty is to the United States of America,'' he said. While noting
that U.S. and Israeli policies on Middle East matters have
generally been similar, he said, ``If they ever diverge, as they
have occasionally, my record shows that I've supported, obviously,
the U.S. position.'' He cited as an example Israel's plan to sell a
quarter-billion-dollar advanced airborne radar warning system to
China. The Clinton administration opposed it, and so did Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   THE FIRST STEP IS ADMITTING YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
</P>
<P>
   Green Party Ralph Nader, running for president as the Green
Party candidate, is actually jeopardizing the environment by
threatening Al Gore's chances, Gore supporters said today. ``His
candidacy poses a high threat to the environment in this country''
because it could ensure the election of George W. Bush, said Robert
F. Kennedy Jr., senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council. Kennedy said Nader's candidacy could take a significant
share of the Democratic vote in Minnesota, Ohio, Oregon,
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Together those states have 72 electoral
votes. Polls show Nader garnering about 4 percent of the vote
nationally. However, pro-environment sentiment is stronger in some
states than in others, magnifying the effect of the Green vote in
the winner-take-all Electoral College.
</P>
<P>
   THE OLD 'SOME OF MY BEST FRIENDS ARE . . . ' DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   The Anti-Defamation League is crying foul over an editorial in
the Amsterdam News that claims that Jews bought the selection of
Joe Lieberman as Al Gore's running mate. In the editorial, Wilbert
Tatum, publisher emeritus of the black-owned newspaper in New York,
wrote: ``Gore and his minions did it for the money . . . the Gore
camp went out all over the world to Jews of means: You've got to
show me the money. When you do, one of yours will be given the
second spot on the ticket.'' ADL national director Abraham Foxman
today called it ``the worst anti-Semitic rhetoric that I have read
in a long time, unless I want to plug into a hate Web site.''
Tatum, whose wife is Jewish, brushed off the ADL's accusations:
``My wife is a Holocaust survivor. My daughter is Jewish. I am not,
nor have I ever been, an anti-Semite,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   DEBATING THE DEBATES
</P>
<P>
   More than eight months after the presidential debate schedule
was announced, George W. Bush has not yet committed to any of the
three proposed debates and may participate in only two. Said Bush
communications director Karen Hughes: ``I believe President Clinton
and Bob Dole debated twice. I believe two times has been the
norm.'' Hughes also noted that while Bush plans on debating Al Gore
in some fashion, Bush aides have not really had a formal discussion
yet to determine what settings would be appropriate. For Bush,
rejecting one of the debates so late in the season can be risky,
opening him to accusations of being either scared or too arrogant
to participate. Already, Gore has pursued this line of attack,
creating a 'debate duck countdown' on his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   YEAH, BUT CAN HE PLAY THE SAX?
</P>
<P>
   Mixing politics with music, Al Gore's children visited the
legendary House of Blues in Los Angeles and said their father will
do an MTV town hall meeting on Sept. 26. ``I'm here to tell you
that my father is extremely tuned into the issues facing this
generation,'' daughter Kristin Gore told about 700 young people
attending MTV's ``Choose or Lose 2000'' party. The Gore offsprings
were there to register members of the cheering crowd to vote.
</P>
<P>
   JUST WHAT THEY NEEDED _ MORE AMMUNITION FOR THE 'LIBERAL BIAS'
CHARGE
</P>
<P>
   The first night of the Democratic convention got more minutes
and pulled in more viewers, both on the networks and on the cable
news channels than the first night of the GOP's. A farewell speech
by President Clinton was largely responsible for the increases. In
spite of Republican demands that the networks not carry more of the
Democratic affair, the three major networks devoted a total of 172
minutes more time to the Democrats on opening night. Said RNC
spokesperson Cliff May: ``We're not suggesting for a minute that
the networks shouldn't be covering Bill and Hillary Clinton. We
just think they also should have been covering Colin Powell and
Condoleezza Rice and Laura Bush. The opening night of the
Democratic convention is important, but so is the opening night of
our convention. Our only intention here was, quite frankly, to
remind them of their commitment to fairness and balance.''
</P>
<P>
   A VAST LEFT-WING CONSPIRACY
</P>
<P>
   Network executives are debating whether the Democratic National
Committee's opening night schedule fell behind because of poor
planning or a strategic ploy to get more airtime for its speakers.
The executives had been expecting that the night would go long,
because President Clinton is known for his lengthy speeches, but at
10:30 Eastern time, when all three broadcasters had expected
President Clinton, they instead got Hillary Clinton, who thus
received prime time coverage in New York, where she is running for
a Senate seat. If her speech had started at its scheduled time, it
would have received partial or no coverage on the three major
networks, which prompted the suits at these outlets to question
whether they had been tricked. ``They do what they do, and we do
what we do. I do feel that, inadvertently or deliberately, we were
manipulated, and it certainly turned out to be a favorable night
for the Democrats,'' said CBS News president Andrew Heyward.
</P>
<P>
   HERE'S THE TORCH, WHERE'S THE McCHICKEN?
</P>
<P>
   Mere moments after hugging Al Gore and leaving him alone onstage
in a symbolic passing of power, President Clinton made a beeline
for the local McDonald's and ordered a cholesterol-laden meal. When
the president pulled out a wad of $20 bills to pay for his crispy
chicken sandwich, french fries and Diet Coke, the young clerks
refused his money: ``It's on the house. They didn't tell you?'' For
a president who promised to lay low so that Gore could command the
spotlight for a couple of days, Clinton made quite a splash in his
new role as slumming second banana. He brought daughter Chelsea,
who informed an amazed patron that she is a vegetarian ``health
food freak'' before ordering an ice cream cone. Another patron
scanned the room for Gore's new running m News Campaign 2000 Web

 &HT;    NEW QUESTIONS WON'T SLOW MERGER, ADVOCATES SAY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Regulators this week hit America Online and Time
Warner with a new round of questions, but consumer advocates doubt
the queries suggest the government will slow the companies'
proposed merger.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) persistent
questioning is ``just part of a charade,'' said Mark Cooper,
research director of the Consumer Federation of America. ``We don't
believe the FCC is going to do anything'' to protect consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said FCC regulators typically ask many questions about
mergers, but then take little action. He pointed to the
commission's recent approval of AT&AMP;T Corp.'s $58 billion
acquisition of MediaOne Group Inc., creating a cable powerhouse
with relatively few restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   When the FCC commissioners examined that deal, ``they waltzed
AT&AMP;T around for awhile...but then they let them do whatever they
wanted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Butler, a spokesman for the Consumers Union, said the
FCC's inquiries into the AOL and Time Warner deal ``are serious and
important.'' But he added that ``the fact that the agency is going
through several rounds of questions is no indication'' the deal
will be curbed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates fear that AOL, the world's largest online
company, and Time Warner, a cable giant with 12.6 million
customers, will impose their services and content on captive
customers if they are allowed to join forces. For example, a
combined AOL-Time Warner could force cable customers to watch only
Warner Brothers' cartoons and take only AOL's Internet access, they
warn.
</P>
<P>
   They want the FCC to ensure that cable customers can get ``open
access'' to the content and services of many competitors, just as
phone customers can choose their long-distance company.
</P>
<P>
   The persistent questions about Time Warner's cable operations
have become so aggravating to some AOL executives that they want to
sell off the cable systems, according to a report Tuesday in
Inside.com, an online media and entertainment news service. The
article quoted unnamed industry sources as saying AOL executives
are uncomfortable with running a regulated business and would
prefer to focus on content and online services.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner spokesman Scott Miller dismissed that story, saying
the management of both AOL and Time Warner share an ``equally
strong'' commitment to the cable business.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocate Cooper said he believes a combined AOL-Time
Warner would sell off its cable operations only if the FCC were to
create an open access standard for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the FCC had established a regime of true open access, then
it would make sense to be a content company,'' he said. ``But it's
exactly the failure of the FCC to act that means (AOL and Time
Warner) aren't going to give up their wires.''
</P>
<P>
   The FCC is reviewing the transfer of Time Warner's broadcast
licenses to AOL. Since the merger was announced Jan. 10, the FCC
has been focusing its investigation on AOL's instant messaging
software and its interactive television platform, as well as on
Time Warner's exclusive contract with Road Runner, a venture that
provides high-speed Internet access via cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives for the two companies said they expect the FCC,
the Federal Trade Commission and the European Union to wrap up
their investigations in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased with how the regulatory review is proceeding,''
AOL spokeswoman Kathy McKiernan said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Time Warner were to sell off its cable holdings, it's
unlikely one company would be able to buy them all. AT&AMP;T, the
largest U.S. cable company, might have the deepest pockets in the
industry, but regulators, mindful of the AT&AMP;T-MediaOne merger, are
likely to be careful about a deal that would make AT&AMP;T even bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Other cable providers might be interested in pieces of Time
</P>
<P>
   Warner's cable pie. For example, Atlanta-based Cox
Communications could expand its San Diego market by acquiring the
Time Warner cable system next door.

   DEM-GORE-BIO-TRANSFORM (Undated) _ After Al Gore ran for
president in 1988 and lost, just as he turned 40, he organized a
series of dinners where he went around the room and asked each
person to tell him where he had gone wrong. It was excruciating,
his friends said, but he insisted on hearing the bad news. Gore
responded, as he always has, by going back to school. He put
together a graduate seminar for one, complete with a syllabus and a
heavy-duty reading list, and applied himself. Politicians often
learn from and are even transformed by a good drubbing at the
polls, but few have pursued their lessons as aggressively as Gore.

   RUSSIA-SUBMARINE (Moscow) _ Russia asked for help from the West
on Wednesday as its own rescuers desperately struggled through
swirling sand and strong currents, trying to reach 116 sailors
trapped in a crippled Russian nuclear submarine on the bottom of
the sea. After days of frustrated attempts to lower a rescue
capsule to the submarine, Russia, which had refused foreign aid,
relented and turned to Britain and Norway for help, the countries'
foreign ministries said. (Summary from wires). By Patrick E. Tyler.

   LAWYERS-PRO-BONO (Undated) _ Inundated by a hyperactive economy
that generates more business than they can often handle, and in
some cases actually turning away paying clients, many law firms
have cut back on pro bono work so sharply that they fall far below
professional guidelines for representing people who can not afford
to pay. The statistics are startling: The roughly 50,000 lawyers at
the nation's 100 highest-grossing firms spent an average of just 8
minutes a day on pro bono cases in 1999, according to a July survey
by the American Lawyer magazine. That comes out to about 36 hours a
year, down sharply from 56 hours in 1992. The decline is troubling
for many in the legal profession, especially because the American
Bar Association urges lawyers to do at least of 50 hours of pro
bono work each year. By Greg Winter.
</P>
<P>
   VODKA-SMUGGLE (New York) _ Over the last two years, a federal
investigation into Russian and Italian organized crime in the ports
of Newark and Elizabeth, N.J., turned up the expected mix of
mundane mob staples: extortion, cigarette smuggling, money
laundering. But federal agents said they also came across a bit of
criminal enterprise that, for pure creative corruption, struck them
as remarkable: a loose-knit web of companies was smuggling tens of
millions of gallons of American-made grain alcohol _ including
millions of gallons from one of the country's oldest distilleries _
to Eastern Europe to slake a seemingly boundless thirst for that
most Russian of spirits, vodka. By William K. Rashbaum.

   HIKER-HUT-ACCESS (In the White Mountains National Forest, N.H.)
_ Over slick boulders, across too-narrow bridges, through mud that
coated their limbs, three hikers in wheelchairs and two on crutches
braved a 12-hour struggle up the Gale Head trail here to arrive at
a hut that some had said they would never use. The moral being,
said one of the hikers: Do not tell us where we cannot go. Their
destination, the Gale Head Hut at an elevation of 4,300 feet, has
just been rebuilt by the Appalachian Mountain Club, and during the
process, some had ridiculed the idea that the club would go to the
expense of making the hut handicapped-accessible, complete with
ramp and bars by toilets. It was ridiculous, they said: no one in a
wheelchair was ever going to get there. They were wrong, it turns
out. By Carey Goldberg.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ah, August. Sweltering heat. Back-to-school. Immortalized on a
Neil Diamond album, ``Hot August Night.'' On the whole, not a great
31 days, although it does have its moments &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You sunburnt sicklemen, of August weary, Come hither from the
furrow and be merry.'' _ Shakespeare's ``The Tempest'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NO, IT IS THE HEAT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   August is not the hottest month. (It just feels that way.) The
hottest day of the year is actually July 21, based on national
averages over the past 10 years. The average high for Fort
Worth-Dallas in August is 96 degrees _ same as in July. The hottest
temperature ever recorded in Texas was in August (120 degrees in
Seymour in 1936) _ although that matches the 120 degrees recorded
in June in Monahans in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it so hot? In the summer, the northern half of the globe
tilts toward the sun, so we're closer to the heat source. Plus, the
longer days mean we spend more time absorbing heat. But take heart.

   The month is named after Augustus Caesar, emperor of Rome from
27 B.C. to A.D. 14. He took over after his great-uncle, a guy you

genius who got Rome functioning again as an empire. He also oversaw
the golden age of Roman literature, which encompassed Virgil and
Horace. He was originally named Gaius Octavius, but adopted
``Augustus'' as a title to emphasize his superiority. (Joke's on
him. He's got a darn unpleasant month named after him.) &QL;

   HOT DOGS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early August falls within the dog days of summer, so named by
the Romans. For the six to eight hottest weeks of the summer (July
3-Aug. 11, or thereabouts), the dog star, Sirius, rises with the
sun. The Romans figured it only added to the sun's heat, hence, dog
days. Source: Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable &QL;

<P>
   AUGUST DOCTRINE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   St. Augustine (A.D. 354-430) was a pillar of the early Christian
church, serving as the Bishop of Hippo in North Africa. He is best
known for his book ``City of God,'' written partly to console
Christians who fled the fall of Rome. In it, he writes of two
cities: the heavenly and the earthly. Christians, as citizens of
the heavenly city, are not to be overly concerned with the earthly,
but are to live on Earth as pilgrims, ever conscious that they'll
be returning to their true home.
</P>
<P>
   Augustine lives on in ways beyond theological. Bob Dylan wrote
``I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine.'' He also shares his name with a
grass.

   HOT CITIES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At least nine states are home to cities named Augusta, notably
Georgia (home of the Masters golf tournament), Maine (it's the
capital), Arkansas, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Montana and
Wisconsin. There's also St. Augustine in Florida. Texas, always
overexuberant, has both an Augusta AND a San Augustine. &QL;

CHOREOGRAPHED VISITS CONTINUE FOR FAMILIES DIVIDED BY NORTH AND
SOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL LEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ On their first full day in South Korea
after half a century of separation from their families, 100 North
Koreans stepped into the bowels of capitalistic excess Wednesday _
a giant shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by a marching band playing a rousing rendition of ``Our
Hope Is Unification,'' an emotional song well known by both North
and South Koreans, the visitors walked under a five-story clock
encrusted with stained glass and through the stainless steel gates
of Lotte World in southern Seoul. A 29-acre mall, it has a 533-room
hotel, an amusement park, three shopping centers, an indoor golf
course and one of Asia's largest duty free shops.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the North Koreans were allowed to stop and shop at any
of the glitzy stores. Once off the bus, the group was whisked up
three flights of stairs into a dimly lit folk museum that features
miniature exhibits of scenes from 5,000 years of Korean history,
with the notable exception of the war that split the country in
two.
</P>
<P>
   Spying the visitors as they filed by, Jeon Ok-im, a clerk at a
women's clothing store, ran out into the main corridor to see them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been great if they could've come to see the
stores,'' Jeon said. ``But I guess they wouldn't have been able to
control them. The atmosphere would have been too free.''
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans trekking through Lotte World Wednesday morning
were half of the group that flew to South Korea on Tuesday to be
reunited with the families they lost during the war 50 years ago.
The reunions are intended as the first step down the long road
toward reunification of the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The other half of the group remained at their hotel, meeting
privately with South Korean family members. In the afternoon, the
two groups traded itineraries in yet another example of the bizarre
orchestration that marks what under normal circumstances would be a
series of intimate, intensely private family affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But the ground rules agreed upon by the two governments, rising
out of five decades of hostility and mistrust between the two
countries, make normality impossible. The North Koreans are staying
in a hotel on one side of the Han River, while their southern
relatives stay in a hotel on the opposite shore.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, their first meeting was a mass gathering in a
cavernous convention hall, bristling with boom microphones and
crawling with reporters and photographers.
</P>
<P>
   And on Wednesday, the North Korean visitors were hustled onto
buses and ferried to Lotte World, when they might have preferred to
spend the entire day with their families.
</P>
<P>
   In North Korea, 100 South Koreans visiting relatives there were
being subjected to a similarly rigid routine.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   South Korean officials chose Lotte World as the site for the
day's tour because of its proximity to the hotel where the North
Koreans are staying _ not to give them a lesson in free market
economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The schedule is very tight, and they have to move around in
groups,'' said the Unification Ministry spokesman, Kim Hyun Do.
``If they were to go out further, the round trip could run up to
four or five hours.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that North Korean government officials, who visited
Seoul earlier this year, went on the same tour, which gave South
Korean officials experience and lessened the logistical
difficulties of the outing.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the noisy symbol of a free-market economy that
greeted them, the North Korean visitors were markedly reserved in
their comments and expressions, visibly mindful of the North Korean
officials who were their ever-present escorts, often holding their
hands as they walked along.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the minders nor the reunion's South Korean organizers,
however, anticipated Oh Soon-kyun, 52, and her daughter. Holding a
large piece of paper with the name of their North Korean family
member, they showed up at Lotte World determined to greet Kim Gyu
Sol, 66, one of the North Korean visitors and the brother of Oh's
husband.
</P>
<P>
   For logistical reasons, the South Korean government allowed only
five South Korean family members to meet with each North Korean
visitor, and Oh and her daughter had been excluded
</P>
<P>
   For a brief moment, Oh and Kim Gyu Sol embraced. With tears
glazing their faces, they whispered a few words to each other. But
Kim Gyu Sol pulled away, saying ``I have to go now,'' and rejoined
the tour group.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Inside the folk museum, Kim Gyu Sol and the other North Koreans
began a miniature journey through the history of their nation,
starting with scenes of stone-age ancestors hunting for food. It
was impossible to know whether the models brought to mind the food
shortages in their own country; both the North Korean visitors and
their South Korean counterparts had been warned not to discuss
matters relating to living conditions in North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans moved from exhibit to exhibit, their faces
fixed in polite expressions that showed little evidence of awe or
envy toward the palaces of wealth and intricate historical tributes
that their Southern counterparts had built over the decades since
the end of the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already seen things like this before,'' said Moon Yang
Ok, 67, who came to visit her younger sister in Seoul. ``We have
these exhibits, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Ri Rok Won, 59, said the exhibits reminded him of his days as a
child in the South. ``I saw the real thing on a school trip a long
time ago,'' Ri said.
</P>
<P>
   But pressed to give his impression of Seoul, he glanced at his
North Korean escort and tapped on his ear. ``His hearing is not
good,'' his escort said.
</P>
<P>
   Ri Don, 82, was more candid. He said the 20-minute bus ride from
the hotel to the shopping mall was a bit nerve racking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad we didn't get in a car accident,'' he said. ``There
are so many cars!''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the warm smiles and welcomes from the people on
the streets made up for the congested streets.
</P>
<P>
   Pak Sang Op, 68, said the Seoul he remembered from 50 years ago
seemed to have deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Han River is the same, but it became a lot murkier,'' he
said. ``The city is just too crowded and doesn't have the freshness
it used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Jo Jyu Gyong, 68, felt differently. ``I'd like to go back to my
old campus someday,'' he mused. Now a celebrated academic in North
Korea, accorded the status of People's Scientist by the founder of
North Korea, Kim Il Sung, Jo graduated from the prestigious Seoul
National University.
</P>
<P>
   He said his mother had put him through university by peddling
goods. But during the war, Jo volunteered to serve in the North
Korean army and, like so many of the visitors on this trip, never
returned home.
</P>
<P>
   The tour ended with models of open-air markets and royal palaces
in the 18th century, and then the visitors watched a short
multimedia presentation of a major Korean naval battle in the late
1500s, which saw the defeat of Japanese invaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We share the same history,'' Pak mused. ``Unification will
lead to more glorious progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans seem more convinced of the potential for
reunification than their Southern compatriots. Lee Jin-kyu, a
retired office worker sitting outside the mall and watching the
hubbub around the North Koreans, was somewhat skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the North Koreans seem to be saying, `Great Leader
this' and `Great Leader that,''' Lee said. ``I sincerely hope that
the two Koreas will soon become one. But it will be difficult if
they keep on saying things like that.''

 &HT;    Holtz has no excuses for 0-11 season in 1999
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Football coaches hate few things more than an excuse. You either
get it done or you don't.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Lou Holtz's first as head coach, the South Carolina
football team didn't get it done. The Gamecocks went 0-11 for the
first time in school history. As a result, they bring the nation's
longest losing streak _ 21 games _into the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   It was, as Holtz described it recently, ``The Lost Year.'' And
not only because of the defeats on the field, but because it was a
season where personal hardship made it nearly impossible to
concentrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back, there is really nothing else we could have
done,'' Holtz said. ``There were just extenuating circumstances,
some unforseen things that came up.''
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances are not excuses for the 1999 season:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  His wife, Beth,had been successfully battling throat cancer
only to have the disease reappear.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  His son Skip, the team's offensive coordinator, fell victim to
a mysterious illness and was hospitalized for almost a week in
September.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  His mother, Ann Marie, died in November, the day before the
Florida game.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A plane that was scheduled to pick up Holtz for a recruiting
trip crashed, killing the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Given what happened in his personal life, going through 16
offensive linemen and six quarterbacks because of injury doesn't
seem quite so depressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest,'' Holtz said, ``I'm proud of the way I coped
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, on the eve of his second year in Columbia, the 63-year
old Holtz has been reinvigorated. In December, doctors at the Mayo
Clinic told Beth Holtz that her cancer was in remission. Friends
say Holtz has had a spring in his step ever since. And he's done
something he never had the emotional energy to do during the
tumultuous 1999 season: He's gotten a little mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't tough enough; I know that now,'' he said. ``But since
last December, I have been. We're not a good, solid, football team
now. But we can be _ and we will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Holtz cracked the whip academically on the players who had been
falling behind. His point: There is more to being a college
football player than just showing up for practice and playing
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting players to line up and play is easy. Developing a team
feeling is much more difficult and we're still trying to do that,''
Holtz said. ``We're in the SEC, and we have standards to meet. But
we have to meet them as a team. It's more than just going out and
playing football. We've got to become football players.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the South Carolina players are beginning to catch on.
Since June, members of the offensive line have been meeting on
their own to work out and watch film together. The offensive line
was the weakest of several weak links on the 1999 team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take the blame,'' said junior guard Phillip Jones, a
graduate of Snellville's Brookwood High. ``It can be attributed to
us. But we also want to be responsible for getting it turned
around.''
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina ranked last of 114 Division I teams in total
offense (229.6 ypg). In the SEC, only Kentucky gave up more sacks
(53) than the Gamecocks, and the Wildcats threw the ball 191 more
times.
</P>
<P>
   But, again, facts _ not excuses _ led to such a dismal
performance. South Carolina suffered so many injuries on the
offensive line that defensive players who never had played offense
were starting for the Gamecocks in SEC competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will never happen again,'' Holtz said.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina has not only a re-energized coach but also a
goal. In his four previous Division I coaching stops, Holtz has
taken the team to a bowl in his second year.
</P>
<P>
   If South Carolina can get the offensive line stabilized, earning
a bowl bid might not be all that farfetched. Quarterback Phil Petty
is healthy again and will have two quality running backs in
sophomores Derek Watson and Andrew Pinnock. Senior wide receiver
Jermale Kelly has the ability to be a big-time player.
</P>
<P>
   The defense, which returns seven starters, never was a problem
last season. It finished fifth in the SEC (307.7 ypg) and 20th in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the rest of the team had played like the defense, we would
have been fine,'' Holtz said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gamecocks will have a chance to break the losing streak at
home Sept. 2 when they host New Mexico State, which finished 6-5 a
year ago playing in the Big West. South Carolina plays its first
four games at home, including the SEC opener Sept. 9 against
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Holtz has decided that the best approach is to
pretend that this is his first year as the South Carolina coach,
that the horrors of 1999, both on and off the field, never
happened.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the losing streak. Focus on the goal. No excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I think it is a realistic goal? Yeah,'' Holtz said. ``It's
probably not likely, but if some things fall into place, we could
make it kind of intesting for some people.''

   HELD: DEM-MENENDEZ-NYT.
</P>
<P>
   DEM-RDP-NYT (Los Angeles) _ A roundup: Vice president Al Gore
arrives in Los Angeles for his presidential nomination at the
Democratic National Convention and tells a flag-waving crowd of
supporters that he is leading a ``new guard'' determined to bring
``positive change'' to the country. The Democratic Party plans to
celebrate the selection of Sen. Joseph Lieberman as Al Gore's
vice-presidential running mate, while assuring the party's diverse
constituencies that despite a platform aimed at the center to draw
voters from outside the Democratic fold, the party will not ignore
the concerns of more liberal Democrats.

<P>
   DEM-GORE-BIO-TRANSFORM-NYT (Undated) _ After Al Gore ran for
president in 1988 and lost, just as he turned 40, he organized a
series of dinners where he went around the room and asked each
person to tell him where he had gone wrong. It was excruciating,
his friends said, but he insisted on hearing the bad news about a
campaign that had started out as an environmental crusade and ended
as a New York food fight. He heard that he had no economic vision
and that he had talked about technology and the environment in ways
people couldn't understand. Oh, and his speaking style needed a ton
of work. Gore responded by going back to school. He put together a
graduate seminar for one, complete with a syllabus and a heavy-duty
reading list, and applied himself to the serious study of tax
policy and business history. Politicians often learn from and are
even transformed by a good drubbing at the polls, but few have
pursued their lessons as aggressively as Gore. By Melinda
Henneberger and Katharine Q. Seelye.

REGULATIONS HAMPER ADVERTISING IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (EDS: Numeral 8. is the correct initial in the byline; also moving
in `f' category.)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   BEIJING _ When Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi set out to create a Chinese
television commercial for Daktarin, an athlete's foot medication
made by a unit of Johnson &AMP; Johnson, the advertising firm faced a
predicament. Chinese government regulations prohibit advertisements
from showing patients or symptoms _ critical elements for a
pharmaceutical commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi eventually resolved the problem by using weeds
as a visual analogy for the foot fungus. That satisfied the
regulators, but frustrated the ad agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creatively, we could be 10 times better than now if it wasn't
for the regulations,'' lamented Philip Li, executive creative
director for Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi's Beijing office.
</P>
<P>
   Rigid government control, however, is the price to enter one of
the world's fastest-growing advertising markets. Li said he had
often had to rework commercials to address the objections of
Chinese censors _ or to avoid running afoul of them in the first
place. ``The regulations are always in the back of your mind,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising is just as problematic for the government. In
China's march from a centrally planned economy to a market economy,
officials have promoted advertising as an accelerator of economic
development and welcomed it as a way to supplant government
subsidies for many television stations and periodicals. On the
other hand, the government has also criticized advertising as a
conduit for both fraud and unwelcome foreign ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will try to be as lenient as possible, but whenever
anything touches cultural values or political stability, it is
something they have to crush right away,'' said Louisa Ha,
president of Dr. Ad Marketing International, a consulting firm
based in the United States that focuses on China.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, for example, recently withdrew a multimillion-dollar
campaign for its Sprite soda because the ads featured a popular
Taiwanese singer, A-Mei, who had sung Taiwan's national anthem at
the inauguration of President Chen Shui-bian of Taiwan. China
regards Taiwan as a renegade province.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they allowed her to be on the commercial, they would be
allowing dissidence,'' Ha said. ``Politics is above everything else
in this country's agenda, whatever economic interests are
sacrificed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Those interests are not insignificant. In the 21 years since a
Shanghai station showed China's first television commercial, for a
Chinese tonic wine, advertising spending in China has soared from
zero to more than $7 billion, and by some estimates is as high as
$12 billion. The range results from discrepancies between published
rates and discounted rates that advertisers are actually charged,
coupled with the weakness of China's accounting system.
</P>
<P>
   While that is a fraction of the $165 billion spent on
advertising in the United States last year, China is one of the
world's fastest-growing markets. It surpassed South Korea to become
Asia's second-largest market behind Japan.
</P>
<P>
   As advertising has mushroomed, so has the government's
determination to keep it under control. In a country where the
media are monitored carefully for their political and social
influence, advertising is considered a privilege bestowed by the
government and not a commercial extension of the right of free
speech.
</P>
<P>
   In adjusting this privilege, the government has updated its
advertising rules more than 30 times in the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines range from vague principles, such as instructing
advertisements to not ``jeopardize the social order,'' to specific
prohibitions, such as those that forbid the use of state symbols
such as the flag or national anthem. Companies are also not allowed
to use superlative terms like ``best'' or compare their products
with those of competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The prohibitions have scuttled ads for such products as Bristol
Myers' painkiller Bufferin, which claimed to be ``the best,'' and
Colgate's diamond-headed toothbrush, which the company asserted was
superior to traditional rectangular toothbrushes. However,
Budweiser's slogan that it is ``America's favorite beer'' was
allowed to air after its brewer, St. Louis-based Anheuser-Busch,
provided statistical evidence to support the claim.
</P>
<P>
   While the regulations may seem severe, the government considers
them a necessary consumer-protection measure in a country where
soaps have claimed to help people lose weight and tonics promise to
make people smarter. In the United States, consumer sophistication
backed by government regulations has convinced most advertisers
that it is in their own best interest to shun exaggerated claims
and outright falsehoods in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Self-regulation is the hallmark of maturity in an advertising
industry,'' said Hong Cheng, a professor of communications at
Bradley University in Peoria, Ill. ``This kind of system is still
in the making in China. That is why the government has to act as a
Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the regulations went into effect, the government said it
has found 160,000 examples of false or misleading advertisements
and has imposed penalties of more than $54 million. The number of
``advertising malpractice'' cases handled by the authorities rose
36 percent last year, led by ads for drugs, medical services and
food.
</P>
<P>
   These included products called Jiannan Capsules (which
translates as Healthy Male Capsules) and Alaska Shengmin Lixiong
Platinum (Alaska Life Strength Chest Platinum). Several of the
cited products trade on the Chinese translation of Viagra, the
impotence treatment, which is not trademarked in China. The
government didn't identify the manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shadow of the regulations hangs over the advertising
creative process from beginning to end,'' said Louis Wong,
president of Beijing-based Megacom Advertising, who estimates that
half of his commercials have to be modified during the approval
process. ``It is annoying, but this is reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Television commercials, which receive the greatest scrutiny due
to their wide viewership, must be submitted to each regional office
of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce before
airing. Many companies submit their storyboards and script before
filming just as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   The approval process is subjective and fragmented, with some
regional offices approving commercials that other offices reject. A
shampoo commercial that showed a glimpse of a bather's shoulder was
accepted in cosmopolitan Shanghai, for example, but banned in a
conservative neighboring province. Other commercials that received
storyboard approval were rejected after the final edit. Some
commercials are censored after they go on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Commercials that violate standards can sometimes be salvaged by
rewriting the script or making other adjustments, but some are
simply banned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our problems are pharmaceuticals and things related to
underwear,'' said Wong. ``The problem is often over-exaggeration of
a product, or that it goes against the general moral standards of
the Chinese population.''
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceuticals face the strictest regulations. That industry,
the largest spender in advertising, faces reviews by public-health
officials as well as advertising regulators. And, because of a
history of exaggerated claims for medicines, advertisers in China
are not allowed to show patients, children or symptoms. Nor can
they associate products with the names of doctors or hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual modesty is also emphasized by the government. Models must
be covered at least 15 centimeters (5.9 inches) down from their
necks and 15 centimeters up from their knees, which can be
inconvenient for companies trying to sell shampoo or underwear.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are marketer for the underwear, you want to demonstrate
that a piece of underwear fits well,'' said Wong, whose firm is
working on an account for Embroform, a Hong Kong underwear company.
``But if you just featured a face of a woman up to the shoulders,
then what is the point of an underwear commercial?''
</P>
<P>
   His firm is looking into using computer animation for the
commercial, and in that way avoid the fate of a previous ad that
was censored because authorities thought a model's miniskirt was
too short.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign manufacturers aren't the only advertisers who have run
into trouble. The government itself has on occasion run afoul of
the censors. A commercial advocating condom use to avoid AIDS and
other sexually transmitted diseases was pulled late last year, two
days after it first appeared, when the State Administration for
Industry and Commerce decided it was too risque
</P>
<P>
   Regulations not only restrict the content of advertisements, but
the structure of the industry. China has 50,000 advertising firms
employing almost half a million people, an average of just under 10
people per company. To protect domestic agencies from foreign
competition and to limit foreign cultural influence, multinational
advertising agencies are required to set up joint ventures and are
limited in their equity. Foreign advertising executives said they
expect China to relax or eliminate that requirement if the country
is admitted to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   While China's advertising market is experiencing dramatic
revenue growth, creative growth is unremarkable as a consequence of
all the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at all the award-winning commercials in the Cannes
Festivals, I can bet 80 percent could not be in China because of
the content,'' said Wong. It's frustrating, he said, but he and
others knew to expect it when they walked into China.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want fun and creative,'' Li concurred, ``that's not
China.''

   Nicklaus LOUISVILLE, Ky. - Jack Nicklaus said his mother, Ellen,
90, who died early Wednesday after a two-year illness, would have
wanted it this way. From all indications, she made him promise not
to let her expected death change his plans.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-year-old Nicklaus, playing in what could be his last PGA
Championship, said he will remain in the tournament, which begins
today at Valhalla Golf Club. He is paired with Tiger Woods and
Vijay Singh.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus visited his mother in Columbus, Ohio, on Monday. He
found out about her death while on the fourth hole of his practice
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will play in the golf tournament, and, by doing so, he is
honoring her wishes to do so,'' said Jim Awtrey, CEO of the PGA of
America.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Water accumulates on the basement floor of our newly acquired
house after every heavy rain.
 &HT;    I've been told that other homes in this community had the same
problem but most owners have solved this by installing a sump pump
to get rid of the water.
 &HT;    Can you give me some idea of what a sump pump is and how it
works?
 &HT;    A: Sump pumps are usually installed in conjunction with drain
tiles that are installed around the perimeter of the basement floor
_ either under the concrete or in a trench cut into the top of the
concrete.
 &HT;    The drain tiles (plastic pipes) collect the ground water and
carry it into the underground sump or well where the pump is
installed.
 &HT;    A float switch inside this sump turns the pump on when the water
reaches a predetermined level.
 &HT;    This water is then discharged through a pipe that carries it
outside to a safe disposal area.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: The aluminum siding on my home is over 18 years old and much
of the finish seems to have worn off, so that it now looks dull.
 &HT;    Can this siding be painted, or must it be replaced with new
siding to make it look good again?
 &HT;    A: Aluminum siding can be painted with most good quality
exterior latex house paints, although there are some paints that
are advertised as being formulated especially for this purpose.
 &HT;    The siding must be thoroughly cleaned before you start,
preferably with a pressure washer that will remove all powdery
residue.
 &HT;    With most brands of paint, at least two coats are recommended.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: We have a problem with our recently laid flagstone patio.
 &HT;    Where puddles form after a rain the flagstone shows streaks and
stains _ apparently due to lime that seeps out from the cement
joints.
 &HT;    How can I remove or wash off these stains and is there any way
to prevent this happening again?
 &HT;    A: You should be able to clean the stains off by washing with a
solution of muriatic acid _ one part acid mixed with four parts
water. Mix the acid into the water in a plastic container (not
metal).
 &HT;    Be sure to wear rubber gloves and boots when you work with the
muriatic acid.
 &HT;    Spread on with a brush or mop and allow it to soak on the
surface for about five minutes or until it stops bubbling. Then
hose off with lots of water.
 &HT;    You can help prevent this happening again by applying a clear
stone sealer over the flagstone after it has dried for a couple of
days.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: We live in an apartment and constantly hear our neighbor's TV
set and stereo when he has them on.
 &HT;    Even when we ask him to turn them down (which he does
reluctantly) we can still hear the noise, especially when he plays
rock music.
 &HT;    Is there anything you can suggest we do to cut down on the
amount of noise that comes through the wall between his apartment
and ours?
 &HT;    A: There is really very little you can do other than actually
erecting a second wall in front of the existing one and filling the
space between the two partitions with acoustical insulation.
 &HT;    An alternative is to put up a second layer of drywall after
first nailing up horizontal resilient metal strips and then
fastening the new layer to these strips with drywall screws.
 &HT;    It would also help to install book shelves or cabinets filled
with books or other heavy objects along that wall and try to seal
off all openings in the wall with caulking compound.
 &HT;    Also, install insulating gaskets behind each electrical outlet
plate on that wall and apply caulking compound along the base of
the wall where it meets the floor.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Questions about home-repair problems should be addressed to
Bernard Gladstone, care of The New York Times Syndication Sales
Corp., 122 E. 42nd St., New York, N.Y. 10168. Questions of general
interest will be answered in this column; Mr. Gladstone regrets
that unpublished letters cannot be answered individually.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    NOTE: Drawing captioned ``SUMP PUMP'' goes with this column.
 &HT;    CAPTION: Sump pump will discharge water that accumulates in sump
when float switch is activated by rising water.

PLAYING THE `WHAT IF' GAME INVOLVING HENRY CISNEROS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BOB RAY SANDERS 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Every time I see Henry Cisneros, I play the ``what
if'' game: ``What if Cisneros had never ... well, you know, done
what he did in his personal life?''
</P>
<P>
   What if the former San Antonio mayor and former secretary of the
Department of Housing and Urban Development had run for the U.S.
Senate from Texas? Or for governor of the Lone Star State?
</P>
<P>
   When I answer those questions, I have no doubt that, before the
revelations about his not-so-private affair, he could have won any
statewide office he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   I am also confident that, instead of listening to the Democrats'
vice presidential nominee, Joe Lieberman, delegates to the
Democratic National Convention would have heard an acceptance
speech from Cisneros _ ``if '' ... Oh, well.
</P>
<P>
   He would have made a great running mate for Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But, what if?
</P>
<P>
   For years, Texas Democrats have been asking whether this
once-popular politician (and still popular citizen) could ever come
back and be successful as a candidate. Based on the reception he
got from his fellow Texans on Wednesday morning, the answer is yes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as Cisneros was waiting to take the stage at a
breakfast for the Texas delegation, former state Land Commissioner
Garry Mauro whispered in my ear: ``Four years. Four to six years
from now.''
</P>
<P>
   That was his prediction for when Cisneros would re-enter the
political ring.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros and his wife, Mary Alice, would make no predictions,
but neither ruled out a future run for public office. The couple
and their 13-year-old son, John Paul, just returned to San Antonio
after being away from Texas and from politics for a few years.
</P>
<P>
   They just moved into their San Antonio home last week, and
Cisneros is busy with a new business.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything else right now, he said, time is the one
thing against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years from now, I'll be a little old,'' said Cisneros, who
is 53.
</P>
<P>
   But what about four to six years from now?
</P>
<P>
   What if?
</P>
<P>
   During the speech to his home-state delegates, Cisneros told
them something they all know and long ago accepted: that the
Democratic ticket ``will not carry Texas in the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   All week, the Texans delegates have realized that their main
goal is not to deliver the state for Gore/Lieberman, but to be the
``truth squad'' to get the real story out to the rest of the nation
about Gov. George W. Bush's record in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis is also on electing more Democrats to Congress,
where they feel the party has a good chance of recapturing the
House and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   They, too, are playing the ``what if'' game, and you'll hear it
for the rest of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   What if there had been a Democrat-controlled Congress when it
was time to vote on a patients' bill of rights, on requiring
background checks at gun shows or when it came time to confirm
nominees to the federal bench?
</P>
<P>
   Things would be very different now, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there is another big ``what if'' floating around in the
minds of many of these delegates, a speculation they really don't
want to talk about out loud.
</P>
<P>
   What if there had been no Monica Lewinsky, Linda Tripp,
impeachment, Senate trial or that demonstration on the White House
lawn?
</P>
<P>
   What if, instead of spending all that time on lawyers and
depositions, the president could have devoted 100 percent of his
efforts to passing a second-term agenda?
</P>
<P>
   Well, Al Gore would not be behind in the polls right now. He
would be waltzing into the White House to the tune of ``Don't Stop
Thinking About Tomorrow''.

ARTS IN AMERICA: A POLITICAL INTERLOCUTOR IS LEARNING ON THE JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK LYMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Philip Seymour Hoffman and Susan Sarandon were
seated on metal chairs near an open French window overlooking the
haze-choked Hollywood Hills, an American flag hanging listlessly
from a 20-foot pole attached to the ledge outside.
</P>
<P>
   Sarandon, who had just addressed the alternative gathering known
as the shadow convention in the chaotic, humid gloom of Patriotic
Hall, had come up here to the fourth-floor press room to be
interviewed by Hoffman. He acts as a kind of guerrilla guide to the
presidential campaign in ``Last Party 2000,'' a documentary being
directed by Donovan Leitch that has been shooting on and off since
March. How has it been going? Sarandon asked Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   He shrugged his shoulders and tugged at the bill of his cap.
``My head is in about 10 different places at once,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His was not the only crew working with digital cameras in and
around this year's Democratic National Convention. At times it
seemed as though people with cameras outnumbered the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   At least six camera crews were scattered around the crowded
lobby and sidewalk outside the shadow convention, with as many more
in the protest zone opposite Staples Center and on the official
convention floor inside. Add to this the individuals with digital
cameras clasped in their fists, and it seemed that no corner of the
crowded scene was left uncovered by filmmakers. But Hoffman, who
was committing a great deal of his time this year (though not all)
to the project, was probably the most famous face among them.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the crowd had fond memories of the earlier ``Last
Party,'' directed by Mark Benjamin and Marc Levin, on which Leitch
was a writer. Shot during the 1992 campaign and released in 1993,
it had a short flurry of success, particularly among young
audiences, though it was somewhat overshadowed by the critically
acclaimed ``War Room,'' a more traditional documentary offering
more of a behind-the-scenes look at that year's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The actor Robert Downey Jr. was the on-camera narrator of the
first ``Last Party,'' the subjective eye through which that year's
presidential election was seen. This year, Leitch said, he felt the
time was right to do it again. But with Hoffman _ the critically
acclaimed and prolific young actor, most recently seen on Broadway
in ``True West'' and on film in ``Flawless,'' ``Magnolia'' and
``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' _ the tone has shifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we did it with Robert Downey, he was like Puck,
frolicking through the convention,'' Leitch said. ``Phil is always
very aware of what is going on around him, and he's very
intellectual and very much wants to know what's going on. His
mantra is: Why should I care? Why is this important to me?''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman was intensely serious and preoccupied as he waited for
one of Patriotic Hall's ancient elevators to arrive with a shudder
and ferry him up to a news conference on the top floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the main reasons that I decided to do this was because
I really didn't know all that much about the political process,
outside of the basics,'' he said. ``I think a lot of people don't
know much more than that. This was an opportunity for me to learn
about it, how it really works, and maybe get more involved and
passionate about it.''
</P>
<P>
   It had been a procession of revelations, he said, about how the
political system functions and how difficult it can be to get
beyond the oratory and the masks and the security perimeters. He
was still digesting it, still learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think that maybe Phil has hit a wall here at the
Democratic convention,'' Leitch said. ``He's been so frustrated
with some of the responses he was getting, and tired of trying to
get behind the facades. I think he may be on the verge of a
breakthrough, where he'll feel compelled to take a stand. I'm
excited, because this is part of his character's development.''
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected in such an enterprise, a documentary on the
fly, it is a reasonably disorganized affair. ``I hope you don't
mind, the plan keeps changing all the time,'' said Rebecca
Chaiklin, one of the film's producers, between cell phone calls
setting up interviews. ``We really are kind of a guerrilla
operation.''
</P>
<P>
   The days begin with a meeting at which plans are made for
stationing the four digital cameras. But the crews try to remain
flexible, able to react to changing events and sudden interview
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   At the shadow convention the filmmakers had planned to hook up
with Bill Maher, host of ``Politically Incorrect,'' but instead
found themselves drawn into interviews with Sarandon, Rep. Tom
Campbell and a representative of Ozomatli, the Latino rock group
that had been playing in the protest zone when the Los Angeles
police pulled the plug on Monday night. Later on Tuesday they
planned to drive into South Central Los Angeles to interview people
on the street and then to go back to Staples Center for the
evening's official events.
</P>
<P>
   The group moved like a pack through the crowded lobby at
Patriotic Hall. Leitch was in the lead, Hoffman close behind, and
Chaiklin tried to follow them and talk on her phone at the same
time. Ben Weinstein, the director of photography, watched them
through the eyepiece of his digital camera while the sound
director, Jordon Pardes, trailed at the rear, his microphone
hanging from a pole over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan is to do three things,'' Leitch said. ``First, we're
going to release some of our footage on an Internet site, some
issue-oriented material and trailers for the movie, along with
links to other campaign-related sites.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Then just before Election Day he hopes to have a soundtrack CD
available in stores, a compilation of protest songs from the 1960s
and '70s, covered by contemporary bands like the Stone Temple
Pilots. ``What we're trying to do is to build a bridge between the
protest generation of those days and the new generation today,''
said, Leitch, son of the '60s folk-pop singer known as Donovan.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time the CD is released, a one-hour
making-of-the-soundtrack program will be seen on VH-1, the
pop-music cable channel. And then, around Inauguration Day in
January, the finished documentary will be given a limited release
in theaters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really very much influenced by the movie `Woodstock,'
the way it looked and felt, and am going for something kind of like
that,'' he said. ``I especially liked that film's use of split
screens.''
</P>
<P>
   He may try something similar in showing President Clinton
speaking to the convention while the police and protesters are
clashing outside.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of hours have already been shot, he said, from the
primaries, from the campaign trail and now from the two national
conventions. The videotapes are shipped daily back to an editing
team in New York, where they are logged and digitized and the
process is begun to give the film some sort of structure. While a
good deal of the material may end up on the eventual Web site, the
version shown in theaters will be of standard length, which means a
lot of trimming and shaping. ``I don't want it to be longer than
100 minutes,'' Leitch said.
</P>
<P>
   As they have moved back and forth between the gatherings of
young political activists and the mainstream apparatus of the
national parties, the filmmakers have come to see that they are
dealing with two fundamentally different ways of looking at the
world, two universes that rarely meet and talk to each other,
Leitch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately we have to find a way in the making of this film to
bring those two worlds together: the world of the people outside
the convention hall, the people on the streets, and the world of
the people on the inside,'' he said. ``We have to figure out how to
make them connect.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarandon smiled gently and leaned forward to hear Hoffman's
soft-spoken questions in the noisy babble of the interview room.
Weinstein hovered, Pardes' boom mike hanging like a pineapple over
everyone's heads. They were talking about Clinton's address to the
convention on Monday night, especially the theatrical lead-in
during which he was seen making his lone way through the strangely
empty corridors of Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was watching it, you know, I could feel a tear in my
eye, I really could,'' Hoffman said. ``I had to stop myself and
say, `Oh no, I'm getting moved, I'm getting manipulated.'''

OPERA REVIEW: FINNISH COMPOSER'S DEBUT OPERA IS A LYRICAL
MASTERPIECE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALZBURG, Austria _ The Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho had
never considered writing an opera until 1992, when she attended the
director Peter Sellars' production of Messiaen's ``St. Francois
d'Assise'' here at the Salzburg Festival.
</P>
<P>
   She said she felt that she lacked a gift for music of narrative
sweep, which she assumed opera demanded.
</P>
<P>
   But Messiaen's contemplative opera was different, an interior
drama that traces the growth of grace in the conflicted saint's
soul. Transported by the work, Saariaho said, she thought to
herself, ``If that is opera, then I can write one.''
</P>
<P>
   She has done so. On Tuesday night at the Felsenreitschule, the
Salzburg Festival presented the world premiere of ``L'Amour de
Loin,'' a haunting and resonant work, with a libretto in French by
the Lebanese-born novelist and essayist Amin Maalouf, who, like
Saariaho, lives in France.
</P>
<P>
   In a way Messiaen's example emboldened the creators to write an
opera that was similarly internalized and reflective. Not much
happens in the story, loosely based on a historical figure, Jaufre
Rudel, a 12th-century troubadour and Prince of Blaye in Aquitaine.
In this operatic telling, Jaufre, sick at heart from his life of
princely excess, develops an idealized love for Clemence, the
beautiful Countess of Tripoli, whom he only hears about from a
pilgrim. The prince rhapsodizes Clemence in song, afraid to meet
her, lest reality spoil his ``love from afar,'' as the opera's
title is translated.
</P>
<P>
   To Saariaho's delight, several of the participants in the
Messiaen production became her collaborators on this project,
including Sellars as director, the soprano Dawn Upshaw and the
conductor Kent Nagano, who led ``St. Francois'' for the 1998
revival at Salzburg. Whatever the reaction to this new opera over
time, ``L'Amour de Loin,'' the most important offering of this
summer's ambitious festival, is an often transfixing and utterly
distinguished work. The ovations were prolonged and deserved.
</P>
<P>
   Though it was not intended as such, ``L'Amour de Loin'' provides
a jolt of sanity amid the political conflicts that of late have
been rattling the world, Austria in particular, over issues of
nationality, immigration, the sanctity of borders and the cultural
gulf between West and East. Maalouf treats these themes in his
effortlessly poetic text, one of the strongest librettos in some
time.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the story is touchingly simple, involving only three
characters. The self-absorbed Jaufre is convinced that the woman of
his fantasies is distant and unobtainable. Perhaps not, says the
pilgrim, who travels often between the western kingdom of Aquitaine
and the eastern citadel of Tripoli. He tells the prince about the
Countess Clemence, who lives in a far-off Arab land, with its
``oceans of sand'' and ``rivers of ash,'' which, of course, just
makes her seem more wondrous to the prince.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Clemence is from Toulouse, which at the time ruled
Tripoli. She spent five happy childhood years in France and longs
to return there. Yet, hearing of the far-off prince's devotion, she
too gets hooked by thoughts of a love that is pure because it is
unknowable.
</P>
<P>
   Idealized love is a well-worn theme, but Maalouf has found a
fresh way to revisit it. In a brilliant stroke, it is Jaufre's
vanity as a troubadour that finally compels him to cross the sea
and face his ideal woman. The pilgrim has sung the prince's love
songs to the countess, but only as best as he could remember them.
The prince is furious. The songs were never intended for Clemence's
ears. But if she is to hear them, then he wants her to hear them
properly. In the end, the long voyage and Jaufre's neurotic passion
undo him. He arrives mortally ill and dies in Clemence's arms.
</P>
<P>
   Maalouf's words invite music, and Saariaho has provided a lushly
beautiful score, structured in five continuous acts lasting two
hours. Best known for her explorations of sound, Saariaho continues
in that vein here with music that combines vivid orchestration, the
subtle use of electronic instruments and imaginative, sometimes
unearthly writing for chorus, which sings from the side of the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   The vocal writing is by turns elegiac and conversational. Her
harmonic language is tonally grounded, with frequent use of
sustained low pedal tones, but not tonal. Bits of dissonance,
piercing overtones and gently jarring electronic sounds spike the
undulant harmonies, but so subtly that the overall aural impression
is of beguiling consonance.
</P>
<P>
   As Sellars noted perceptively during a news conference,
Saariaho's music invites you ``to relax, to enter a beautiful safe
atmosphere, to lower your resistance.'' Yet in doing so the music
sometimes lacks urgency. Stretches of the score pass by, beautiful,
yes, but lacking in profile, just orchestral backdrops for the
singer's reflections.
</P>
<P>
   Every time the score startles us with rhythmic agitation, or
shouts and handclaps from the chorus, the range of Saariaho's gift
becomes clearer. Her evocations of the troubadour songs, with
medieval modal harmony and fragments of elegiac tunes, are
marvelous. But finally, you must accept a score for what it is, not
for what it isn't, and this one does what it set out to do with
great skill and authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   Sellars, a famously controversial director, is at his most
inspired here. His set designer, George Tsypin, has created a
magical medieval world in this coliseumlike theater. The lovers
from afar live in tall, isolated towers of glass with colored
spirals. Jaufre is conveyed up and down in a fantastic elevator;
Clemence climbs a rotating spiral staircase. To represent the sea
that separates them, the entire stage, speckled with light by the
designer James Ingalls, has been filled with shallow water through
which the pilgrim slogs, the prince rides a slow boat and, after
her idealized lover dies, Clemence wallows.
</P>
<P>
   The American baritone Dwayne Croft sings Jaufre with burnished
sound, virile energy and dreamy lyricism. Upshaw brings sublime
vocal beauty and poignant vulnerability to her portrayal. Sadly, a
health problem forced a close colleague of theirs, Lorraine Hunt,
who was to have sung the role of the male pilgrim, to withdraw. In
her place is the excellent Czech mezzo-soprano Dagmar Peckova.
Sellars elicits affecting portrayals from all three, who fearlessly
inhabit their roles. Upshaw ended the performance sopping wet and
emotionally exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable Nagano, directing the SWR-Sinfonieorchester of
Baden-Baden, Germany, and Freiburg, Germany, with additional
musicians from Ircam, the contemporary music center in Paris, and
the Arnold Schoenberg Choir, led what seemed a confident, incisive
and shapely first performance of a complex score.
</P>
<P>
   Sellars, who was moved to tears during a news conference in
speaking about the work's creators, said that ``L'Amour de Loin''
was scheduled for productions elsewhere, details of which are to be
announced. He will have to adapt his conception, of course. Not
many opera houses can provide the resources he enjoyed at the
Salzburg Festival. There will be four more performances through
Aug. 30.

A `GOOD EYE,' CHARGING BY THE GLANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also: DECORATOR-PRICE)  
 By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In her book-lined Greenwich Village apartment, Judith
Young Mallin shuddered, recalling her intimidating brush with a top
interior design team. For Mallin, an expert in Surrealist art, it
was like entering a hall of mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   Divorced, she was undertaking the makeover of a 1910 small-scale
loft for her new, single life. With a budget of $200,000 in mind,
she agreed to a basic design fee of $15,000 and a construction cost
of about $190,000. Unspecified ``additional'' services ``requested
by the owner'' would be billed at up to $150 an hour, but because
her budget was tight, she avoided any extras, even using her own
furniture to avoid the designer markups.
</P>
<P>
   To her dismay, monthly bills for hourly fees started rolling in,
often exceeding $15,000. When the project quickly ballooned to over
half a million dollars, she panicked. Demanding a copy of itemized
charges, she found it loaded with services she assumed were
included in the fee: meetings, site visits, drafting reviews. Among
them was a $150 charge for a discussion the designers had with each
other about where to put a giant television set that Mallin said
she had told them she didn't want. She had even been charged for
meeting with them on how to scale back the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like trying to keep sand from running through my
fingers,'' Mallin recalled. ``I know artsy people. They don't use
decorators, so there was no one for me to call and say, `What do
you do?' And I still feel like I was incredibly naive.''
</P>
<P>
   Mallin is hardly alone in feeling mugged in a decorating
project. Few relationships are more fraught with inequalities and
potential misunderstandings than the one between client and
decorator _ the only mentionable business relationship in which a
perfect stranger is in your bedroom within 20 minutes of meeting
you, as one designer put it.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Bedol, a media industry executive, and his wife, Judith,
have worked with three decorators in 10 years. The first experience
was formative. At one point, the designer suddenly started bringing
in pieces that were out of their price range and ordering things
without their approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we confronted him,'' Bedol said, ``he told us that we
needed to spend more money because he'd lost some clients to the
stock market crash. And if we didn't spend more he couldn't keep us
on.''
</P>
<P>
   The services a decorator renders are often impossible to pin
down. There is no right way or wrong way to decorate a room. Nor
can a price tag be put on taste, or a so-called ``good eye.'' Add
to the psychological imbalance the mind-boggling complexity and
ever-shifting methods by which designers seek reimbursement for
their time-consuming services, which can include weekend shopping
at a tag sale and baby-sitting an electronics geek installing your
home theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're buying from me is time out of my life,'' said
Jarrett Hedborg, the Los Angeles designer whose clients include
Bette Midler, Jack Nicholson and Saudi Arabian royalty. He bills by
the hour, with a commission. ``Listen, me standing around with your
whiny plumber is simply going to cost you.''
</P>
<P>
   In today's flush economy, traditional billing methods are being
tested by a savvy new consumer who wants to know what things cost.
The old-school approach usually involves a designer's fee plus a
markup _ usually 25 percent to 40 percent _ on all the furnishings
that the decorator buys at the to-the-trade price. High-society
clients used to be too polite (or too snobbish) to ask, ``How
much?''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the easy availability of showroom catalogs and glossy
design magazines, and the arrival of eBay and Sotheby's and
Christie's online, ``people have great access to product now'' and
a much better idea what things might cost, said Mayer Rus, editor
in chief of Interior Design. It's a moment of transition, ``a
watershed moment,'' added Hedborg, with designers trying to figure
out how to get reasonable fees for their creative services, which
have expanded far beyond furniture procurement.
</P>
<P>
   If the system lends itself to abuse, it's partly because it is
largely unregulated. The American Society of Interior Designers,
with 20,000 members nationwide and a code of ethics for those who
add the ASID designation after their names, sets standards for its
members' expertise and education in 19 states, and can reprimand or
suspend members who violate the code.
</P>
<P>
   But no one can put a true price on either the designer's
creativity or the client's insecurities. The problem, Hedborg said,
``is that I'm selling my talent for a price based on an object.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think I'm worth more than a table,'' he said. ``It
feels smarmy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bedol is one of many clients who feel duped by the markup
system. ``I'll never understand a system that gives decorators an
incentive to spend as much money as possible,'' he said. ``When
I've suggested to a few of them that there could be a bonus for
spending less, like they do in commercial work, they just laughed
at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating the situation, stores like ABC Carpet and
Home, Crate &AMP; Barrel and other retailers have started producing
furniture even a picky decorator might purchase. But what client is
going to be happy paying a designer markup on something picked up
effortlessly in a place like that?
</P>
<P>
   While many designers defend the old system as the most equitable
and respectful of the designer's talent, a growing number of
younger designers are working more on a business school model as
consultants, billing by the hour (built-in protection with
indecisive clients), charging an agreed-upon lump sum or a day rate
and sometimes even using the client's own credit card to pay for
purchases directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a shopper; people hire me for a concept,'' said
Jennifer Post, one of the new school. ``I bill solely on a
project-fee basis, determined by the scope of the project, the time
involved and the amount of work. I don't charge any percentage on
fabrics, on the construction costs or on the hourly fee. I have my
client's credit cards because they like their free travel points.
There's no deceit, no cheating, no paperwork.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But even straightforward business methods don't always dispel
the mystery and the suspicions that surround decorating, which is
all about projecting an image. ``It's always awkward,'' said
Marjorie Garber, the author of ``Sex and Real Estate: Why We Love
Houses'' (Pantheon), a new book on the social pathologies
intricately linked to the home. ``These strangers are supposed to
become experts in your taste _ of which you're none too sure
yourself. And there's always the worry that if it's not expensive,
then you're not getting your money's worth. The money is what makes
it glamorous.''
</P>
<P>
   But glamour can cost. In thrall to a famous New York designer,
one couple on the upper East Side agreed to buy an unusual antique
desk with leather drawers for $90,000, based on photographs the
designer showed them. When the ``antique'' arrived at their house,
a substantial part had been newly remade. It was appraised
subsequently for no more than $10,000. They had a hard time
returning it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suspected that the designer and the dealer were very cozy
and that there were kickbacks to the advantage of both,'' the wife
said. Though they questioned the designer's ethics, they loved his
aesthetic and would hire him again _ which is why they refused to
give their names. ``If the piece works and you love the look ...''
the woman tried to explain. She blames herself for not ``focusing
more'' on particulars.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the American Society of Interior Designers,
Jerry R. Harke, strongly urges clients to be more skeptical:
``Whenever you're buying an expensive antique, be sure to get an
independent appraisal.''
</P>
<P>
   John Landrum Bryant, who sells lighting fixtures, bathroom
hardware and furniture to designers and the public by appointment,
has seen both sides in action. ``The decorator's role,'' he said,
``is to infantilize the client to the point where the client feels
it's impossible to make any decision about anything, be it what
furniture to buy, what flowers to put on the table, even what
towels to use.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Bryant cited his own experiences accompanying his
interior designer on shopping trips to Paris. ``They always stay in
the fancier hotel _ the Ritz, or Costes is very popular _ while you
stay somewhere else much more modest,'' he said. ``If you're making
a commission on a seven-figure purchase, you can afford to pay for
the Ritz, too.'' Besides, he added, ``they have to troll for new
clients.''
</P>
<P>
   High-rolling decorators raise fewer eyebrows than the
inscrutable relationship between designers and their sources for
custom-made furnishings. Custom design is a highly inexact art,
with prices fluctuating depending upon many factors, including the
availability of fabric and workers, and the due date. Nearly all of
the more than a dozen designers interviewed for this article said
they had at some point been approached by suppliers and
manufacturers more than willing to pad their bills for the
decorator. Post, who has been in business for eight years, said she
was still surprised at how often suppliers whisper: ``What do you
want me to put on this bill?''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I tell them my billing is totally open to my clients,''
she said, ``they say, `You're so stupid!'''
</P>
<P>
   An architect who requested anonymity is now building a house
that is being furnished by an interior designer. ``I know the
interior designer is ripping off the client and the supplier is in
on it,'' he said. The architect has not said anything to the
client. ``They do good work,'' he said. He said that, once before,
he notified another supplier about a $15,000 error on a bill only
to have the supplier ask, implying a kickback offer, ``Whose name
should go on the check?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been tempted to tell the client,'' the architect said.
``But the suppliers would stop working with me because I was a
tattletale. It's really rampant, a never-ending spiral.''
</P>
<P>
   One furniture maker, who started out in the retail business and
now has a trade-only clientele, described a ruse in which he said
he had refused to participate. Twice, decorators have requested
that he send them his bill showing a ``retail'' price, which the
decorator would pay and then pass along to the client, adding his
normal markup. Then the decorator would then go back to the maker
and ask to be reimbursed for his usual discount _ thus being paid
twice.
</P>
<P>
   Vendors like that furniture maker point out that there is a lot
of room for adjustment on the bill's journey from supplier to
client. This can lead to the case of the $1,000 throw pillow.
</P>
<P>
   Keller Henderson of Keller Henderson Interiors in New York tried
to offer some perspective on the sometimes hair-raising prices
decorators charge, particularly to their Clients From Hell. ``Let's
say a client is really wringing you out,'' he said. ``You're
spending a lot of time shopping for things they don't like, and
you're losing your shirt. Somehow, you've got to recoup your
expenses.'' Suddenly a $350 pillow triples in price when it lands,
like a karate chop, on the client's silk-and-linen threaded sofa.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson said that another alternative, when clients become
difficult, is ``to drop them with the paint still wet on the
wall.''
</P>
<P>
   The absence of any visible price tags in showrooms tends to add
to the lay person's sense of being left in the dark. Gregory
Marshall, sales director at J. Robert Scott, a furniture showroom
chain, said, ``We don't tag furniture because it would scare the
customers away.'' He noted that friends, neighbors and relatives of
a designer's client will frequently call to check on prices, but
``we don't divulge any prices to anyone but the designer.''
</P>
<P>
   So is decorator pricing always a shell game? Clearly not. More
and more designers are spelling out their fees in lengthy
contracts. Few complaints get to court, despite the well-publicized
legal action in which Philadelphia clients accused the New York
design team of Stephen Sills and James Huniford of inflating
charges for furniture and fixtures. (Huniford said yesterday that
``the issues that remain unresolved are in private arbitration.'')
</P>
<P>
   The American Society of Interior Designers points out that in
the past three years, only 59 complaints have been lodged against
their 20,000 members. (Sills and Huniford are not members of the
society.) Only six complaints have resulted in disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very human business,'' said Karen Fisher, president of
Design Previews, which matches clients with decorators. Mike
Strohl, who represents more than 30 designers in the New York area,
said he often heard about clients who resort to the kind of
browbeating that could drive anyone to the brink: trying to buy
from vendors directly to avoid paying markups, demanding to see
endless options on every bathroom fixture and refusing to pay their
bills after custom work has been fully installed.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bohn, a New York designer, said, only half in jest: ``I
reduce my prices for people who don't make me crazy. If I don't
have to show you 50 of one thing, you get a discount.''
</P>
<P>
   While everyone thinks that his designer is living it up at the
Ritz, the designer is more likely to be beating the pavement like a
well-dressed Willy Loman. ``You look for hours and hours trying to
find the right thing, or maybe you spend months looking for a
certain fabric that only costs you $10,'' Diana Vinoly said. ``But
if you don't actually buy something, they really don't expect you
to bill them for that time. In the end, they are all always
shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinoly entered the business through the tried-and-true method of
designing for friends, and has yet to turn it all into a profitable
business. But she has remained on good terms with her clients, once
the dust settled and the Japanese bamboo shades were hung. Glitches
that seemed unsurmountable melt into thin air with the first sigh
of awed admiration from a visitor, or the first quiet night at home
sprawled on the rolled-back couch.
</P>
<P>
   If Tolstoy had ever had his dacha ``done,'' he might have put it
this way: Happy clients are all alike. The unhappy ones you're
going to hear from.

`JEW VS. JEW': SO MUCH RUMBLING THAT HE FEARS FOR THE FOUNDATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes at end of review; Jonathan Rosen is the
author of the novel ``Eve's Apple.'' His next book, ``The Talmud
and the Internet: A Journey Between Worlds'' will be published next
month by Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux.) By JONATHAN ROSEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I have nothing in common with the Jews,'' Franz Kafka wrote
crankily in his diary. ``Most days I don't even have anything in
common with myself.'' Kafka's complaint is funny in part because it
is so familiarly Jewish _ Moses, who tried to talk God out of
choosing him as a prophet, might have said as much. But for Samuel
G. Freedman, the fact that Jews don't get along is no laughing
matter. Invoking dire images of the fall of the Second Temple _ for
which Jewish tradition blames religious disunity _ Freedman
believes that American Jews have nothing less than a civil war on
their hands.
</P>
<P>
   To support this thesis, Freedman _ a former reporter for The New
York Times and the author of several books, including a compelling
portrait of a black church in Brooklyn _ focuses on some recent
episodes of American Jewish strife. These include the collapse of a
conversion panel in Denver made up of Orthodox, Conservative and
Reform rabbis; the lawsuit of five Orthodox students who wished to
avoid co-ed housing at Yale; a quarrel at a California synagogue
over liturgical emendation; and a zoning battle in a Ohio suburb
that pitted Jews of various affiliations against Orthodox
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman, who is also a professor of journalism, builds his
portraits with great care. He has clearly done a vast amount of
reporting and research and has rooted his study in the history of
modern America. He strengthens his accounts of individuals with an
understanding of the communities they live in. He is good at
tracing the way a suburb grows from a few houses to a full-fledged
community and how the tenuous balance of ethnic fellowship is
maintained _ and disturbed. He evokes the simultaneous loss and
transfiguration that characterizes the immigrant journey into
American success.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the eruption of discord that Freedman sees as
representative of American Judaism, and his chapters are bent
around this thesis. This can give his examples a somewhat forced
quality. The lawsuit conducted by the ``Yale Five'' was, after all,
aimed at Yale University; the fact that the dean of students and
the president of the university were Jewish, something Freedman
makes much of, seems oddly irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   A battle at a Los Angeles synagogue over inclusion of the
matriarchs alongside the names of the patriarchs in the Amida, the
centerpiece of synagogue liturgy _ though it stirred the passions
of the congregation _ hardly seems a schismatic matter. One need
only think of the fate of Maimonides, the great medieval Jewish
philosopher, whose compilation of Jewish law, the Mishneh Torah,
was burnt as heretical when it first appeared, to realize how mild
much American Jewish discord is.
</P>
<P>
   Far more dramatic is the chapter that deals with the planting of
a bomb in a Florida synagogue to protest the appearance of Shimon
Peres and the Oslo accords he participated in. The act is presented
as an emblematic episode, yet the Orthodox Jew who hid the bomb
seems to have had a history of emotional disturbance, the rabbi of
the synagogue he attended was the one who tipped off the
authorities, and the bomber himself fully expected the bomb would
be found. (He called the police).
</P>
<P>
   The event, though it undoubtedly resonates more grimly after the
assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, has a completely different
character from that calamity, despite Freedman's implication that
Israeli religious discord is finding an echo in the United States.
Indeed the assassination of Rabin may say more about how Israel has
become like the United States than a bomb in a Florida synagogue
shows how the country is becoming like Israel. In Israel, where
Orthodox Jews have a share of political power and
government-sanctioned authority, the notion of religious civil war
is far more relevant. The rise of the Orthodox right wing in the
United States, which Freedman intelligently chronicles, may say as
much about American fundamentalist culture as it does about
Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is to suggest that there aren't real issues
dividing American Jews. Freedman, an excellent journalist, is
surely on the trail of a good story. But he has defined that story,
and in some sense religious life itself, so narrowly that American
Jews are all drafted by his book into conflicts that many may feel
touch only peripherally on their religious lives.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially apparent in several of his conclusions. He
speaks of the triumph of the ``Orthodox model,'' by which he means
the notion that ``religion defines Jewish identity.'' This may come
as a shock to a large number of Conservative, Reform and
Reconstructionist Jews, not to mention unaffiliated Jews with deep
religious identities. It is one thing to claim that secular Judaism
has fizzled as a movement. It is another to confuse religious life
with Orthodoxy. This is a particularly ironic conclusion given
Freedman's own understanding that millions of Jews who poured into
this country as immigrants in the early part of this century and
promptly vanished into assimilated culture were, by and large, the
products of Orthodox families. Was that the failure of the Orthodox
model?
</P>
<P>
   The boundaries of Judaism seem far more fluid than Freedman
would have us believe, even today. Freedman is no doubt right that
Israel once rallied American Jews in a way it now fails to, but it
is also true that Zionism itself has been, since the beginning of
the 20th century, a deeply divisive issue for Jews. But perhaps all
this is a way of quarreling with the subtitle of this book, which
implies a monolithic community capable of a single soul. American
Judaism may well have as many souls as it has bodies, a fact that
no doubt argues for the health of the religion.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Freedman provides a thought-provoking and timely
tour of Jewish-American religious ferment. Whether the conflicts he
chronicles are a throwback to earlier struggles, an omen of a
coming crisis, or the necessary accompaniment of the development of
a living faith is, of course, a matter of opinion.

<P>
   This is not your preacher's end-times book. Well, maybe it is.
But it's definitely not ``The Millennium for Dummies.''
</P>
<P>
   Springing, in large part, from a July 1997 conference of the
Tyndale Fellowship in England, ``Eschatology in Bible &AMP; Theology''
presents material on topics including Revelation, Ezekiel, Paul's
thought, and writings on modern theology and physics. Commenting on
hell is E. Earle Ellis of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary
in Fort Worth. Particularly interesting are Alan Garrow's
dissection of Revelation and Crispin H.T. Fletcher-Louis' thoughts
on the Jerusalem temple.
</P>
<P>
   Readers may raise an eyebrow at stands taken by some of the
authors. ``Eschatology in Bible &AMP; Theology'' is definitely aimed at
advanced students and their instructors, with untransliterated
Hebrew and Greek terms cropping up regularly. Bring your lexicons,
and prepare to think. &QL;

   Third Day &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Essential Records &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Third Day's successful 1999 album, ``Time,'' earned a Grammy
nomination and a Dove award for rock album of the year and produced
four No. 1 singles.
</P>
<P>
   The safe thing would have been to capitalize on that momentum by
going back into the studio and recording another rock CD. Instead,
Third Day took a bold step and recorded a worship album.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe it wasn't that risky. After all, groups like
Delirious and the ``Passion'' series have made praise and worship
music popular. And it's a genre in which Third Day is accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a full album of worship songs _ five new cuts and six
live versions of previous Third Day songs _ is a departure, so much
so that lead singer Mac Powell almost apologizes on one of the live
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a Third Day concert, he tells the crowd, they've come
to a church service, one that features the popular Third Day sound
_ Powell's gritty vocals over a basic guitar-and-drums rock _ along
with lyrics that glorify God. The result is an album that should
appeal to hard-core fans and new listeners. &QL;

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: BRITISH PLAYS TRADE ON THE UNEXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   By BEN BRANTLEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It really isn't spoiling anything to reveal the final
lines of the two most recent plays by Alan Ayckbourn. They are, as
a matter of fact, exactly the same, though spoken by different
actors. And they are not concluding words that seem destined for
immortality: ``Ah, well. That's life, I suppose.''
</P>
<P>
   Before you start fretting that the prolific Ayckbourn has at
last depleted his wit, remember that in theater, as in life,
context is everything. It's not just what's said that's important,
but also when, where and how.
</P>
<P>
   When and where, in particular, have rarely counted for as much
as they do in Ayckbourn's ``House'' and ``Garden,'' the joyful,
mournful and intricately interrelated comedies directed by their
author at the Royal National Theater. Ayckbourn wrote the plays
concurrently in celebration of his 60th birthday, and they are
being performed simultaneously _ at the same time by the same
performers, who run between two different stages _ in what turns
into an invigorating celebration of the possibilities of theater.
</P>
<P>
   Ayckbourn is a comic chronicler of suburban discontent whose
technique is often as exotic as his subject matter is familiar.
Here he stretches his imagination and his actors' stamina to render
a single disastrous day as observed both within a country manor and
in the garden just outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``House'' and ``Garden'' are eminently enjoyable as individual
pieces. To see them in succession, however (I did both in one day,
and the sequence is immaterial), is a mind-flexing delight. Each
play deeply enriches the other while teasingly reminding us that
any view presented by a work of art is only partial. By the second
time you reach that concluding shrug of a comment _ ``That's life,
I suppose'' _ you may find that you have tears in your eyes because
you know so much more than when you first heard it, spoken by
somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   Who says the theater has reached a dead end? The current London
season is filled with confirmations of how protean the discipline
remains, as variable and potentially surprising as human beings
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Local observers may lament the Americanization of the London
stage, with its adaptations of Hollywood movies and reliance on
brand-name celebrities. But if you look past pandering hits like
``The Graduate,'' you'll discover an abiding, very British penchant
for playing with plays, a delight in demonstrating what theater can
do that other forms cannot.
</P>
<P>
   The sensibility is evident in everything from the blistering
revival of Peter Nichols' ``Passion Play,'' a 1981 study of
infidelity in which husband and wife are each played by two actors,
to the Globe Theater's production of ``Hamlet,'' in which the
soliloquies of the title character, played by Mark Rylance,
sometimes turn into boisterous exchanges with the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Just what gives a show an audacious freshness can range from the
use of actors to the choice of theater. The season's unexpected
sleeper, and the one London production already assured of a
Broadway transfer, is a hymn to actorly inventiveness: Marie Jones'
``Stones in His Pockets,'' in which two performers embody a baker's
dozen of characters to tell the story of an Irish village invaded
by a Hollywood production company.
</P>
<P>
   A 200-year-old comedy, Fanny Burney's ``Busy Day,'' finally
makes its West End debut, with a smooth, canny interpretation that
finds immediate accessibility through judicious exaggeration. And
the summer's classiest glamour tickets have been the Almeida
Theater's rotating productions of ``Richard II'' and
``Coriolanus,'' directed by Jonathan Kent and scheduled for a run
at the Brooklyn Academy of Music this fall.
</P>
<P>
   That Ralph Fiennes plays both heroes obviously has much to do
with their success. But it's important not to underestimate the
impact of the setting: the cavernous, derelict Gainsborough movie
studios in Islington, a mightily resonant backdrop for works
dealing with the fragility of empire, smashingly exploited by Kent
and his designer, Paul Brown.
</P>
<P>
   All of these shows benefit from what might be described as
stunts or gimmicks. Well, of course. Gimmicks, as the singing
strippers in the musical ``Gypsy'' so convincingly point out, are
the essence of show business.
</P>
<P>
   There is a difference, however, between gimmicks that exist
merely to capture crowds (like having a middle-aged movie star take
off all her clothes) and those provided by Ayckbourn's current
comedies, where what at first seems like just a clever gambit
actually deepens your response to the productions.
</P>
<P>
   I'll confess that when I first saw Nichols' ``Passion Play,'' in
a London production 15 years ago, I wasn't entirely convinced of
the necessity of giving onstage alter egos to the main characters.
Sure, there's duplicity involved in any marriage, but isn't part of
an actor's job to suggest layers of conflict?
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, this latest ``Passion Play,'' another product of
the invaluable Donmar Warehouse, made me feel that I had missed the
point the first time. Under Michael Grandage's gimlet-eyed
direction, this minimalist production brings out the shattering
core of Nichols' thesis: that adultery, as the straying husband in
the play suggests in a semantic meditation, adulterates,
fragmenting lives and polluting tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passion Play'' isn't just a matter of people saying one thing
while thinking another. Nichols' manipulation of his divided
characters is far more subtle, ultimately daring to suggest that
one ``self''is no more viable than another and that the inability
to reconcile the two is genuinely tragic.
</P>
<P>
   This revelation grows in painful increments through the
carefully graded performances of James Laurenson, Nicky Henson,
Cherie Lunghi and Cheryl Campbell _ as the torn spouses _ and of
Nicola Walker as the feckless young woman who comes between them.
The crucifix patterns in Christopher Oram's stripped-down set and
in Grandage's staging subliminally emphasize the religious agony of
the title.
</P>
<P>
   The play has the hubris to offer Mozart's Requiem as a comment
on an extramarital fling. But by the evening's end, the choice
seems entirely justified, echoing D.H. Lawrence's contention that
the cross is a symbol of how we are divided within ourselves. Like
the National's production of a very different look at the
corrupting effects of deception, Arthur Miller's ``All My Sons,''
this ``Passion Play'' leaves you flattened. And yet you know you
wouldn't have missed it for anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stones in His Pockets'' is, by comparison, a frolic. Jones'
account of an American movie crew wreaking havoc in a County Kerry
hamlet examines distorting cultural stereotypes in ways that tend
to be stereotyped themselves, and it could definitely profit from
editing.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there's nothing new in the shallowness of the
Hollywood visitors who condescendingly rule over the villagers who
have signed on as extras. Nor is the somber history of a local
suicide comfortably integrated into the evening's dominant
balminess.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you're unlikely to stop smiling through most of the show
for the simple reason that everyone, from a desperate drug addict
to an excruciatingly earnest young movie goddess, is played by two
remarkably nimble actors, Conleth Hill and Sean Campion. Ian
McElhinney's direction capitalizes splendidly on the pleasure of
watching these metamorphoses, especially when it concentrates on
the blurred reality that sets in when Irish villagers play
Hollywood's idea of Irish villagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at her look at us lookin' dispossessed,'' explains one
extra to another, defining their job description for that day. Just
how Campion and Hill register such levels of being, in ways that
happily include a brutal ``Riverdance''-style sequence, is a giddy
treat.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Globe Theater, which seeks to conjure the experience of
watching plays in the days of Shakespeare, has drawn criticism for
emphasizing crowd-pleasing accessibility over nuance. Yet it's this
populist dimension that makes the Globe such fun.
</P>
<P>
   Its current ``Hamlet,'' directed by Giles Block, may not have
the chic interpretive gloss of the Almeida's ``Coriolanus.'' It's a
doggedly conventional rendering with generally pedestrian
supporting performances. Yet it delivers its story with absorbing,
fast-paced clarity. And in Mark Rylance, who is also the company's
artistic director, it has a compelling Hamlet who wears both
royalty and ambivalence as if they were a jester's motley.
Rylance's prince, in feigning madness, is clearly caught up in the
clownish, theatrical pleasures of the role; he is also repeatedly
lanced with pain as he remembers the reality beneath the ruse.
</P>
<P>
   In emphasizing the showman in Hamlet, Rylance invites the
audience to share in the character's monologues. When this Hamlet
asks, ``Am I a coward?,'' it isn't just rhetorical. The groundlings
standing at the edge of the stage are eager to answer him. Watching
Rylance integrate such responses into his performance provides a
thrilling suggestion of the theater of 400 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The house, alas, appeared to be half empty the Friday I saw ``A
Busy Day,'' the first West End production of the Regency comedy by
the novelist Fanny Burney, best known today for her diaries and
letters. This neglect by audiences is a shame and a surprise. As a
literary curiosity, this story of romance and class conflict in a
socially unsettled London is fascinating, anticipating many of the
thematic threads more gently plied by Jane Austen.
</P>
<P>
   More crucially, the play, under Jonathan Church's direction,
emerges as a fiendishly vivid parade of aristocrats and parvenus.
The actors gleefully demonstrate that caricature can be a fine art,
especially Ben Moor as a half-witted peacock of a lord and
Stephanie Beacham (of ``Dynasty'' fame) as a gargoylish slave to
snobbery.
</P>
<P>
   If the course of love is bumpy in Regency London, it seems to be
no smoother in the contemporary English suburbs of ``House'' and
``Garden,'' where the chances of happy unions are devastatingly
remote.
</P>
<P>
   These complementary works, which follow the events both indoors
and out surrounding a misbegotten village fete, are notably
different in tone. ``House'' is the more verbal and socially barbed
play, as befits its interior setting, promisingly accented with
French windows. The alfresco ``Garden'' has an appropriately
bacchanalian flavor, with a firmer emphasis on physical comedy.
</P>
<P>
   As the plays anatomize three different souring marriages (as
well as several other varieties of sexual relationships), a gentle
melancholy rises above the comic fray, like the melodic solo in a
flute concerto. With an ideally balanced ensemble led by David Haig
and Jane Asher as the miserably married lord and lady of the manor,
``House'' and ``Garden'' find an illuminating common ground in
their respective forms of farce.
</P>
<P>
   The denizens of ``House'' may be the more articulate lot, given
to tidy metaphors that describe their plight. In ``Garden,'' the
same characters are more likely to express themselves by wrestling
or dancing or hiding in bushes. But in either play there's no
avoiding Ayckbourn's insistence that communication between people
is a pretty futile business.
</P>
<P>
   This is a play, after all, in which the most passionate and
satisfactory relationship is between an Englishman and a
Frenchwoman who can't speak each other's languages. Ayckbourn's
vivaciously orchestrated scenes of slapstick and volleys of
dialogue curiously add up to an existential sadness.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is infinite curiosity and affection in his view of
life's frustrations, and an infectiousness in the zest with which
he shapes that perspective into not one, but two, works of theater.
A warm, vital amusement, as well as a resigned fatalism, shine
through that simple curtain line: ``Ah, well. That's life, I
suppose.'' Isn't it a curse? And isn't it fun? &QL;

 &HT;    CRAZINESS AS USUAL AT CONVENTION PARTIES
 &HT;    By JILL VEJNOSKA
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's the party of inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pearls for the girls! Pearls for the girls!'' Louisiana Sen.
John Breaux whoops as he swoops down on a slightly startled-looking
pair of women who suddenly find their elegant evening wear draped
in colorful Mardi Gras beads.
</P>
<P>
   The party that believes no one should go hungry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gumbo, it's VERY good for you,'' a chef says as he
practically pushes a ladle into the hands of a business-suited man
who has already loaded down his plate with crawfish and
manhole-sized onion rings at the ``Great Gumbo and Jammin'
Jambalaya'' food island.
</P>
<P>
   The party of universal health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catch 'em, because it hurts if they hit you in the head,'' Ed
Lombard, clerk of the criminal court in New Orleans, tells the
crowd reaching for beads thrown off a parade float on a Paramount
Studios lot here.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``Mardi Gras Goes Hollywood,'' Breaux's contribution to the
swirling party circuit surrounding the Democratic National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's event was as lavish as the three parade floats brought
here from New Orleans, and as outrageously fun as the Day-Glo
orange satin outfit in which Breaux greets his hundreds of guests.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it may be the only time during convention week when a
politician actually tries to be photographed looking goofy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are hundreds of these of me,'' Breaux says, stopping
prancing around with a fringed yellow umbrella long enough to pose
for a picture with an arriving party-goer. ``After about a hundred
of them, it doesn't hurt you in Louisiana. It helps!''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Tuesday's party was not your typical event in a
week devoted to the deadly serious business of charting a major
political party's future and nominating the possible next leader of
the most powerful nation on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   But in some ways it's awfully typical: corporate America
throwing parties for the the politically connected.
</P>
<P>
   ``This goes on a lot,'' said Tony Anderson, standing on a movie
set street of fake brownstones and _ for this night only _ an
``Acme Oyster Bar,'' a ``Kickin' Cajun Grill'' and a ``Pat
O'Brien's Hurricanes'' stand. ``I went to a great party at Spago on
Sunday night. There were about 2,000 people there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spago party, which honored Rep. Dick Gephardt, the
Missourian who could become speaker should the Democrats capture
the House in November, was sponsored by major corporations such as
AT&AMP;T, BellSouth, Disney, Andersen Consulting and (Tony Anderson's
employer) Ernst &AMP; Young.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four corporations footed the bill for Breaux's party,
including AT&AMP;T, Brown &AMP; Williamson, Lockheed Martin, Merck and
Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these companies have business before the Senate Finance
and Commerce committees, of which Breaux is a member.
</P>
<P>
   But business, says Breaux, is not why he wanted to have this
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New Orleans, we have Mardi Gras to celebrate before
starting 40 days of Lent,'' said Breaux. ``Tonight, we're
celebrating before starting 40 days of campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   While one might quibble with his math (some 80 days actually
remain until Election Day), there's no disputing that Breaux's a
heckuva lot of fun.
</P>
<P>
   That much was obvious even before he finally stopped dancing
onstage with Rockin' Dopsie and the Zydeco Twisters and went off to
change into his outfit for the parade of what he'd earlier
described as his ``Hollywood Krewe''.
</P>
<P>
   Just past 9 p.m., Breaux appeared high atop a float, wearing a
white satin outfit with orange and green plumes that made him look
like Liberace crossed with Elvis.
</P>
<P>
   At most of the other parties, it was Hollywood celebrities
rather than the Washington politicos who supplied the glamour.
</P>
<P>
   The list goes on and on _ from Brad Pitt, who sat next to
Hillary Rodham Clinton at a Saturday fund-raising dinner for her
New York Senate campaign that also featured Cher singing and John
Travolta buddying around with the president, to ``West Wing'' stars
Martin Sheen and Rob Lowe partying Sunday on their fake Oval Office
set with Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, Health and Human Services
Secretary Donna Shalala and First Daughter Chelsea Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's Bloomberg News-sponsored party at Spago (again) saw New
York's congressional delegation tucking in with Tom Brokaw,
Christie Brinkley and some of the ``West Wing'' cast (again). And
while Breaux's party was going on Tuesday, so was California
congresswoman Loretta Sanchez's controversial fund-raiser for
Hispanic Unity USA. The guest list for that party, which Sanchez
relocated from the politically incorrect Playboy Mansion, included
Shalala, former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros and actor Bill
Maher.
</P>
<P>
   At Breaux's party Tuesday, current ``Angel'' and former ``Buffy
the Vampire Slayer'' star David Boreanez provided a near-perfect
commentary on the merging worlds of Washington and Hollywood this
week. Just inside the Paramount front gate, a check-in table bore
the sign ``Members of Congress and Administration.'' When someone
jokingly asked if he was a congressman, Boreanez, who was waiting
to be driven into the party on a golf cart, grinned slyly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe someday,'' he said as he was whisked off. ``Maybe
someday very soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Also at Breaux's party, held on the set where parts of ``Ally
McBeal,'' ``Frasier,'' and ``NYPD Blue'' are filmed, were former
Miss USA Ali Landry, football great-turned-broadcaster Terry
Bradshaw, a handful of congressmen, some lobbyists, Gore for
President campaign chairman William Daley, and the man who very
nearly became Gore's running mate, North Carolina Sen. John
Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most intriguing celebrity guest of all was a man
almost no one knew was there. Tipper Gore's father, Jack Aitcheson,
sat quietly at a table with his wife, Margaret, eating authentic
Louisiana food and drinking in the sounds of Big Bad Voodoo Daddy
performing live.
</P>
<P>
   Having arrived in L.A. the previous day following a three-day,
cross-country Amtrak ride from their home in Alexandria, Va., the
Aitchesons had already been sightseeing in Malibu and Beverly
Hills. Earlier Tuesday, they'd spent some time in a box above the
convention floor with several of the Gores' daughters.
</P>
<P>
   His feeling when Al Gore finally is nominated Thursday night?
</P>
<P>
   ``Awesome,'' said Jack Aitcheson, the former owner of a small
plumbing supply business. ``Absolutely awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? Somebody here may even decide to throw a party.

   INTERNATIONALRUSSIA-SUB _ LONDON _ A British rescue team is
expected to begin a long voyage Thursday to assist a stranded
Russian submarine amid fears that they may arrive too late to save
the lives of 118 crewmembers trapped in the vessel. A flurry of
activity Wednesday _ including a reluctant call by Russian
officials for foreign assistance _ came after the only sign of life
from the submarine fell silent. For days Russian officials have
reported hearing tapping against the Kursk's hull, but the sounds
ceased Wednesday, suggesting the worst for the crew aboard the
submarine about 350 feet below the surface of the Barents Sea.

DEMENTED FOREVER, OR JUST DULL?
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
The underground movie-making ``cinema terrorists'' of ``Cecil B.
DeMented'' have a chant to work themselves into a film-making
frenzy.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Demented forever,'' they shout in honor of their cult leader,
director Cecil B. DeMented.
</P>
<P>
   By all indications that's what director John Waters would like
to have written on his tombstone when he passes on to some grungy,
sticky-floored cinema in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Waters made his early reputation with sleazy gross-out stunts
and characters, back when it was the only way his films could get
attention. The movies were indeed demented, at least to the ruling
establishments of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Having created his own personal genre, the John Waters film, he
has clung to it tenaciously, while adapting to success.
</P>
<P>
   It's not been easy. Whatever humor value his movies had _ and
actually, it was very little _ it was because what Waters was
showing was forbidden and utterly tasteless.
</P>
<P>
   What has changed since Waters did ``Pink Flamingos,'' ``Female
Trouble'' and ``Multiple Maniacs'' is that gross-out is now common
in movies _ granted, not to the extreme Waters sometime took it _
and Waters is forced, by economics, to work within the system. He
could still be making true underground movies like the hero
director of ``Cecil B. DeMented.'' But then he would not be touring
around doing interviews in huge suites in Four Seasons hotels.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Cecil B. DeMented,'' the director of the same name (Stephen
Dorff) is not merely outrageous but militant. He and his band of
filmmakers are so underground and anti-establishment they even hate
independent film. They despise everything Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   They kidnap fading A-list actress Honey Whitlock (Melanie
Griffith in an odd career choice) to force her to star in their new
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Waters' fans know that former kidnap victim Patty Hearst often
appears in Waters' movies (in this one, she plays the mother of one
of the young terrorists who kidnaps Honey). The kidnapping of Honey
parallels some of Hearst's own experience.
</P>
<P>
   Forced to do without imported bottled water and other luxuries,
Honey whines, begs, threatens and schemes to get free. Failing
that, she becomes _ or at least pretends to become, it's rather
vague _ a disciple of DeMented.
</P>
<P>
   Together they crash into theaters, Hollywood parties and
shopping malls to do guerilla filmmaking in which innocent
passers-by become extras and, if they get in the way, gunned-down
victims.
</P>
<P>
   All this is carried out with forced silliness and countless
in-jokes about Hollywood (such as the obscure names of filmmakers
that DeMented's crew tattoo on their arms).
</P>
<P>
   Even more than in his other recent efforts such as ``Hair
Spray,'' ``Cry-Baby,'' ``Serial Mom'' and ``Pecker,'' this movie is
all stunted outrageousness and very little actual humor. The movies
are no longer offensive, but they are still just not funny.
``DeMented'' is actually difficult to sit through because it's
dull.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Waters' movies are not meant to be enjoyed by sober
critics in afternoon screenings, but at midnight shows where a
large, rowdy audience is mostly under the influence of something.
</P>
<P>
   Actors should be admired for taking chances, and Griffith at
least jumps into the role with both feet. What she lands in is
another matter. The film is so meandering that her performance is
wasted. Dorff, as DeMented, just seems to be ranting.
</P>
<P>
   The film's guest cast includes Waters regulars Mink Stole, Ricki
Lake and Hearst. &QL; 
``Cecil B. DeMented'' &QL; 
Starring: Melanie Griffith, Stephen Dorff &QL; 
Director/screenwriter: John Waters &QL; 
Rating: R, for strong crude sexual content, violence, language and
drug use. &QL; 
Running time: 88 minutes &QL;

 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Former San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros, billing
himself as a part-time campaigner eager to help longtime friend Al
Gore, Wednesday urged Texas delegates to the Democratic National
Convention to share the ``truth'' about GOP presidential nominee
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other Democrats in American can perform this service for
America,'' Cisneros told the Texans.
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, Cisneros, a former Clinton administration
housing secretary who moved back to Texas last week, said he's not
fully up to speed on what the truth about Bush is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been in Texas for the last number of years, so I
have not been up close and personal,'' he said. ``But I do know
that it is not correct to paper over some of the deficiencies that
exist in our state related to uninsured children and the number of
children in poverty and issues of inadequacies in our schools and
so forth.''
</P>
<P>
   The breakfast speech marked a return to politics for Cisneros,
who spent the last three years in Los Angeles as president of
Univision, the nation's largest Spanish-language television
network. He is now involved with a San Antonio-based company aimed
at developing inner-city housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I've been out of politics for a little bit and I'm
out of practice,'' he told the Texas delegates, who greeted him
with a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros' political star declined precipitously after his
romantic ties to former aide Linda Jones were disclosed in 1988.
Last year, he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor federal charge
stemming from inaccurate statements he had made to the FBI about
payments he had made to Jones. Cisneros paid a $10,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   In his Wednesday speech, Cisneros was far easier on Bush _
opting instead to praise Gore _ than other speakers at the
delegation breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush has never said the word AIDS or HIV publicly,''
said state Rep. Glen Maxey of Austin. ``Do we want him in the White
House?''
</P>
<P>
   ``This man is a tool of the special interests,'' Rep. Eddie
Bernice Johnson of Dallas said at a delegation breakfast sponsored
by several corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, for the most part, stayed positive, speaking glowingly
of Gore as an ``intelligent, tough-minded man'' who is
exceptionally qualified for the top spot.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros urged Texas Democrats _ who now hold no statewide
offices _ to keep their chins up through what could be a difficult
election year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no illusions as a Texan about how difficult November is
going to be in Texas. I have no illusions about that and the
chances are, speaking honestly right here between us, that we're
not going to carry Texas in the presidential election of the year
2000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are going to win a bunch of congressional seats in
Texas. ... The Democratic Party of Texas is alive and well at the
grass roots, and it is going to be back in this election and in
elections to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros said ``missed opportunities'' in Texas will become
clear ``as soon as this (Bush) juggernaut is over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have too many people living in poor housing in
Texas,'' he said. ``We still have too many people living without
good jobs in Texas. We still have too many children who are
uninsured in Texas. We still have too many seniors who don't have
the medical care they need in Texas. We still have too many
communities in Texas that have been left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   After the speech, Cisneros continued to deny that his return to
Texas is the first step toward rekindling a political career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no plans to run for office, no ambition,'' he said. ``I
swear to you I want to get on the ground in San Antonio and get to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   But he declined to say never.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never is a long time,'' he noted. ``Ten years from now, I'll
be a little old, but who knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros said he would back Laredo oilman Tony Sanchez if he
decides to run for governor in 2002. Sanchez, a Democrat, has been
a high-dollar supporter of Bush for governor and has raised more
than $100,000 for the Bush presidential campaign.

 &HT;    Valhalla getBy Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. - After a couple of practice rounds at Valhalla,
site of the PGA Championship that begins today, something strange
has happened.
</P>
<P>
   The players like it.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them think that Valhalla is much better than it was in
1996, when it hosted a PGA 10 years after it was built.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to see Winged Foot or a traditional golf course
with trees everywhere,'' two-time U.S. Open champion Lee Janzen
said, ``but I think this is a fantastic golf course and a beautiful
setting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected to come here and be very disappointed, but I'm not
disappointed at all,'' said Australian Stuart Appleby, who did not
play Valhalla in 1996. ``I sure don't know what everybody was
complaining about.''
</P>
<P>
   While the more traditional players dislike a mounded,
humps-and-bumps course, where weird bounces can decide a major, the
Valhalla's reviews are improving.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to (gripe) about it, then don't come,'' Buick
Open winner Rocco Mediate said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's matured a lot since the last time,'' Paul Azinger said.
``The course is in unbelievable shape. I've never seen fairways
like this before. You just can't get grass better than it is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed
</P>
<P>
   Before Tiger Woods began dominating, major championships were
wide open. It's not a development that has escaped Mark Brooks, who
defeated Kenny Perry at Valhalla in 1996 for his only major title.
Brooks hasn't won since. ``If the guy is stronger, faster, smarter,
all the other things, he usually wins,'' Brooks said. ``Right now,
I think he's right there. I hope he's peaked.'' . . .
Georgia-connected players in today's first round of the PGA are
Duluth residents Stewart Cink and Scott Dunlap; Sea Island's Davis
Love III, the 1997 PGA champion; Peachtree City's Franklin Langham;
club pro Mike Gill of Columbus; and Dalton's Michael Clark, who won
his first PGA Tour event, the John Deere Classic, last month. . . .
New looks: Steve Jones and his goatee; Paul Stankowski and his
peroxide-streaked hair. . . . New angle: John Daly recently
recording a country song in Branson, Mo., named ``You Can Lean On
Me.'' Daly said, ``My singing's terrible, but it's better than my
golf lately.''

``GODZILLA 2000'' IS OLD-STYLE MONSTER-MOVIE MAYHEM
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
When Hollywood usurped Japan's Godzilla franchise in 1998, fans
were as riled as their cranky reptile hero.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Instead of a lovable, doglike dino waddling on its hind legs and
waving its arms like a man in a rubber suit (which Godzilla always
was), Hollywood delivered a soulless, computer-animated lizard
engulfed by production overkill.
</P>
<P>
   But Japan has come to the rescue. Last year, its Toho Studios
issued a new Godzilla film, which hits the United States as
``Godzilla 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Disregard the name. This is old-style monster-movie mayhem,
which is to say, a Godzilla movie as God intended: a lovably
amusing foray into vapid plotting, bad dubbing and men in rubber
suits trashing miniature sets.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't appreciate such cheesy charms, then go hide in your
precious art house to await the next Shakespeare adaptation.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say this 23rd Godzilla entry lacks updating. A
few scenes are computer-generated, and the big boy is seamlessly
blended into long-shot exteriors of actual locations, with
bizarrely fanciful results.
</P>
<P>
   The testy titan also gets tweaking via new dorsal fins, a
worsened overbite and a spiffy warmup to his fire-breathing, as he
gargles flames before belching them out.
</P>
<P>
   But largely old formulas are intact: A noble scientist and
smarty-pants kid try to save Godzilla while witless government
types try to kill him, despite the fact that only Godzy stands
between Japan and yet another monstrous threat.
</P>
<P>
   In this case it's a huge spaceship that parks atop a Tokyo
skyscraper, siphoning off the city's data and energies.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow the ship and Zilla become rivals, zapping each other
until the vessel disgorges its own monster, which seems styled
after the alien of ``Predator.''
</P>
<P>
   Their rumble amid the crumble plays precisely like TV wrestling:
fake yet fun belligerence fired by bombast and signifying nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Even fans are apt to laugh at such vacant, if spectacular,
excess, but the biggest laughs may be unintended in a film whose
staged comic relief is limp and witless.
</P>
<P>
   Take the dubbing _ please. Oratorical voices sound parodistic,
and lines rarely match mouth movements.
</P>
<P>
   Anglo slang also sounds wacky, some jump-cuts are absurdly
abrupt, and human heroics are cornball, scored by equally corny
music.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the dialogue: ``Did you see that flying rock go
by?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in its own weird way, this Zilla can be a thrillah.
</P>
<P>
   From a storyboard standpoint, its action scenes are
well-conceived, even if their execution is undercut by the budget.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, ``Godzilla 2000'' taps into a now-rare and
innocent sense of wonder.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't just about monsters. It's about awestruck responses
to the fantastic, whether that means balletic jets swooping to
attack or the awful yet amazing sight of a giant beast rumbling
forward like a force of nature.
</P>
<P>
   As a scientist says, ``It's like a scene from an old
science-fiction movie!'' Well, duh.
</P>
<P>
   Yet any sociological grounding has long lapsed. Godzilla no
longer is a cathartic metaphor for Japan's A-bomb traumas of World
War II. Rather, he's a durable film icon who deserves respect _
even if he's a big baby at heart.
</P>
<P>
   Godzilla, you see, never plays well with others. He stumbles
down streets like Pigpen of ``Peanuts,'' leaving dusty trails of
debris, and tends to get testy at the falling of a leaf _ or the
firing of a missile.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear what he wants, but we sense it's not peace and
quiet. Godzilla advances rather than retreats when attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he's just looking for sheer, mindless adventure. If
that's your bag, too, then this rock-'em, sock-'em throwback to the
drive-in era is for you.

 &HT;    Georgia resident key player in Korean rapprochement
 &HT;    By Keith Graham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. - Across the Pacific in Korea, families divided
since the Korean War were reuniting in tearful, heart-tugging
scenes being flashed around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In his office adjacent to the University of Georgia campus, Han
Park was recalling another emotional moment nearly 20 years ago.
Park was in remote northeast China then, visiting ethnic Korean
families whose ties to their relatives in South Korea had been
similarly shattered by the war and the bamboo curtain that blocked
all communications afterward.
</P>
<P>
   He was hauling a video camera, shooting pictures that would then
be broadcast on South Korean television in hopes of helping
families rediscover long-lost loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   Riding in a cart pulled by a cow, he arrived at the home of an
elderly man who had begged him to visit. ``This old man is like a
skeleton,'' recalled Park, director of the university's Center for
the Study of Global Issues. ``I asked him whom are you looking for.
You know, he said my father. He was in his 80s. His father would
have been 100, 110 years old. And that really made me think.''
</P>
<P>
   Park sorrowfully told the man his father would likely be dead.
``People do not live that long,'' he said. But the man replied, ``I
would just be relieved if I saw my father's grave.''
</P>
<P>
   Park paused as he retold the story. ``When you are separated
like that, the same bloodline, unless you meet, you know, the pain
is still there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The reunions taking place this week affect only a few hundred
Koreans whose lives have been marred by that kind of pain, but they
symbolize a rapprochement between the divided Koreas that Park has
long worked to facilitate.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Gregg, former ambassador to South Korea and now president
of the Korea Society in New York, said Park is ``one of the
American architects _ if not an architect, certainly a contributor
_ to the breakthrough that's now taking place'' on the Korean
peninsula and potentially improving the prospects for peace in East
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, over the objections of the military regime that then
ruled South Korea, Park, a scholar who has taught in Athens for
three decades, traveled to North Korea for the first time. He's
been back ``35, 36, 37 times,'' he said, apologizing for no longer
recalling the exact number.
</P>
<P>
   Park admits to being nervous on his first trip to the isolated
Communist nation. And he's been warned on later trips _ especially
after one of his key contacts, Hwang Jang-yop, became a
high-profile defector _ that his personal safety could be in
jeopardy. But, over the years, Park has come to understand the
North Korean mind probably as well as anyone, according to Gregg.
</P>
<P>
   That understanding also made him uniquely situated to be an
informal go-between as North and South Korea weighed the options
before agreeing to their historic summit, which finally took place
in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I played some role in persuading them,'' said Park,
who acknowledged being ``one of'' the channels who conveyed to the
North that Kim Dae-jung was sincere in desiring a summit.
</P>
<P>
   Many times, the North Koreans said a meeting was out of the
question. But Park emphasized that he was not a messenger from the
South, but a foreigner _ an American _ trying to be objective, and
he tried to respond patiently to specific objections raised by the
North.

DEFINING MOMENT FOR GORE

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a city where the persistent smog makes downtown skyscrapers
indistinct from half a mile away even on the sunniest days, the
chairman of the Republican National Committee this week brandished
a copy of Al Gore's ``Earth in the Balance'' as evidence that the
vice president should be denied promotion. Jim Nicholson says the
book portrays America as ``a dysfunctional society.''
</P>
<P>
   This is astonishing. The environment was Gore's passion
throughout his congressional career; he has been an effective
leader on land use, solid waste, air quality, and the long-term
dangers of global warming. Yet the Republican ticket, composed of
two men with impeccable oil-patch credentials, thinks it can turn
the environment to its advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night Gore will speak to the nation. Many have
suggested that he urgently needs to reinvent himself. But he would
be better advised to reinforce himself.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has much to talk about _ accomplishments that are distinct
from those of President Clinton and that should build a solid base
for a presidential candidate. But he has not locked them in.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was far ahead of his peers in recognizing the potential
impact of the Internet and other technological advances, but
critics have mocked him for taking too much credit, and he changed
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has a global perspective and a depth of foreign policy
experience that George W. Bush cannot approach, yet Gore has not
convinced the nation.
</P>
<P>
   It was Clinton who said the era of big government is over, but
Gore did much of the detail work necessary to make the bureaucracy
leaner, yet he does not claim credit.
</P>
<P>
   Major health care improvements were a centerpiece of
Clinton-Gore '92, but were dropped after 1994. A revival of
boldness on this front is overdue.
</P>
<P>
   Gore does need to define himself more clearly Thursday night,
but not by robing himself in a new persona dictated by a consultant
or embracing issues recommended by a focus group. Reinforcement,
not reinvention.

   LAWYERS-PRO-BONO (Undated) _ Inundated by a hyperactive economy
that generates more business than they can often handle, many law
firms have cut back on pro bono work so sharply that they fall far
below professional guidelines for representing people who can not
afford to pay. The decline is troubling for many in the legal
profession, especially because the American Bar Association urges
lawyers to do at least of 50 hours of pro bono work each year, and
the roughly 50,000 lawyers at the nation's 100 highest-grossing
firms are averaging only 36 hours a year. By Greg Winter.

   DEM-GORE-BIO-TRANSFORM (Undated) _ After Al Gore ran for
president in 1988 and lost, he organized a series of dinners where
he went around the room and asked each person to tell him where he
had gone wrong. It was excruciating, his friends said, but he
insisted on hearing the bad news. Gore responded, as he always has,
by going back to school. He put together a graduate seminar for
one, complete with a syllabus and a heavy-duty reading list, and
applied himself. Politicians often learn from and are even
transformed by a good drubbing at the polls, but few have pursued
their lessons as aggressively as Gore. By Melinda Henneberger and

   VODKA-SMUGGLE (New York) _ Over the last two years, a federal
investigation into Russian and Italian organized crime in the ports
of Newark and Elizabeth, N.J., turned up the expected mix of
mundane mob staples: extortion, cigarette smuggling, money
laundering. But federal agents said they also came across a bit of
criminal enterprise that, for pure creative corruption, struck them
as remarkable: a loose-knit web of companies was smuggling tens of
millions of gallons of American-made grain alcohol to Eastern
Europe to slake a seemingly boundless thirst for that most Russian

Hut at an elevation of 4,300 feet, which has just been rebuilt by

Agriculture Secretary &UR; Dan Glickman &LR;  suggested that the only way &UR; Al
Gore  &LR; could top  &UR; Bill Clinton &LR; 's gladiatorlike approach to the
podium at the Democratic National Convention on Monday night, Aug.
14, is if the vice president jumped from a sky box and parachuted
down, says the Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The choreographers who planned Clinton's arrival were his old
pals  &UR; Harry &LR;  and  &UR; Linda Bloodworth Thomason &LR; , creators of
``Designing Women'' (and the White House travel office scandal).
Harry Thomason told  &LR; Inside.com &LR;  that he got his inspiration from
the movies. ``I think I saw `High Noon' about a month ago, and I
thought, `They've been gunning for him for eight years.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In order for the plan to work, the Secret Service had to agree
not to appear in any of the camera shots. The corridors of the
Staples Center were sealed, and agents walked backward behind the
camera. Thomason had taped a rehearsal, with an extra playing the
president, in the dead of night. ``You could look at it and tell it
was good.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomason couldn't resist saying that the president had called
him from the White House on Tuesday, Aug. 15, to tell him ``that
everyone had been talking about The Walk,''  &LR; Inside.com &LR;  reported.
</P>

``which is why I've had to turn to doing commercial work like the

<P>
   ``I hate myself for doing things like that, but it's the only

<TEXT>
<P>
   The excruciating wait while rescuers struggle to reach Russia's
sunken submarine and the 116 men on board is a reminder of how
ephemeral life can be in the risky world of the military. Even in
the unlikely event they can all be brought to the surface alive,
the ordeal shows the vulnerability of even highly sophisticated
ships to fatal chance.
</P>
<P>
   The submarine, Kursk, got into serious trouble despite being
only five years old, one of the few vessels the post-Soviet Russian
Navy has built. It was surely made more vulnerable by chronic poor
maintenance resulting from extreme underfunding of the military,
but the sinking apparently was connected with a disaster, perhaps
an explosion in a forward compartment, that might have occurred on
even a well-maintained submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Early Russian reluctance to accept offers of help from abroad
has fortunately given way to willingness to give British and
Norwegian rescuers a chance to try to reach the crew. That act of
mutual accommodation is an important reflection of the way the
world has changed in the post-Cold War era. The Russian naval
maneuvers were a relic of that older, hostile era _ as was, to a
degree, the nearby presence of an American surveillance vessel that
may have detected the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The disaster points to the need for additional cooperation among
Russian, American, and other naval programs. In the case of
submarines, compatible fittings for rescue vessels to reach
stranded crews is practical from both a technical and political
point of view. This should be discussed at the first opportunity.
Important models for such systems exist in the cooperative
international space station system.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the world waits to learn the fate of those trapped in
the cold bleakness of a crippled submarine _ perhaps 400 feet from
safety but also perhaps beyond help.

ANTONIO LOPES, 103, THOUGHT TO BE LAST NEW BEDFORD WHALER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Antonio Lopes was a fisherman. He worked the waters off the Cape
Verde Islands. When he was 24, he went looking for larger quarry:
whales.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Lopes, the man reputed to be the last of the New Bedford
whalers, died Aug. 7 in his home in the former Massachusetts
whaling port. He was 103.
</P>
<P>
   He was born and raised on the island of Sao Nicolau. He left the
island on Sept. 14, 1921.
</P>
<P>
   ``A man came to the island looking for whalers, on the schooner
William Graban. He told me to come, that America had a lot of work.
I believed him and went,'' Mr. Lopes said in a story published in
the Globe on Jan. 11, 1998. ``I never saw my family again, never
went back to my country.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no jobs here, so I went back out on a whaling
schooner, the Claudia. We were gone six months; whalers would go
out six months at a time. I made $13 before I left on the Claudia
and got another $25 when I got back.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Lopes said it was hard work. ``Sometimes you go two weeks
without seeing a whale, but you never sit. Never. You paint, you
wash the decks, always you wash the decks. You don't sit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd go down to the West Indies, then up to Newfoundland,
Canada, looking for whales. Sperm whales. There were 35 men on a
ship. The lookout, he sees one, he shouts, ``Thar she
blooooooooows! ``How far?'' the captain would yell, and we'd hear
``1 mile'' or ``2 mile,'' and the captain would order the
whaleboats in the water. If we got the whale, the lookout would get
$5 extra for each one he spotted.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Lopes was an oarsman on a 20-foot whaleboat. The boat had a
man steering, a harpooner, and a crew of four. ``We'd row and row
and row, 18-foot oars, lot of work, and the harpooner would stab
the whale, and then the next man, he would kill the whale, shoot
him in the head with a bomb, a gun that would shoot bombs. Blood
everywhere, but it would kill the whale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we'd have to row and row and drag the whale back to the
schooner. That was very hard, but we did it. Then we'd cut the
whale right there, in the water, big pieces. Other men would use
big poles to pull up pieces and put them in a huge pot on the deck
and cook the oil right out of the blubber, cook it right out, and
then the oil would run down below decks to a big iron tank. Most of
the fat was just behind the head of the whale, and we'd use pails
to scoop it out and put it in the big pot. Oil was the valuable
part; the parts that no give oil, they leave, let it go back in the
ocean. The sharks would eat it all. There were many, many sharks.''
</P>
<P>
   During his voyage on the Claudia, Mr. Lopes and his crewmates
dispatched 29 whales. ``That's a lot,'' he said. ``It would take
six hours to bring one in and then two, maybe three days to cut it
up and get all the blubber out and into the pot to get the oil.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he and his crewmates ate lots of beans, rounds of bread,
and plenty of whale meat. He said it tasted like hamburger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have many friends on the ship, most of them Cape Verdean,
like me,'' he said. ``One of my friends, Miguel Almeida, was a
harpooner; he died in 1972 in Providence. A few of the others died
only a few years ago. I am the last.''
</P>
<P>
   After another six-month whaling trip on the Graban, for which he
was paid $10, Mr. Lopes worked on the cranberry bogs, made nails
for Atlas Tack in Fairhaven, Mass., and was employed by North
Cordage Co. in New Bedford for 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves two daughters, Dorothy Lopes and Lydia Stevens of New
Bedford; two stepdaughters, Emily Almeida of New Bedford and
Frances Custodio of Wakefield, Mass.; four grandchildren, and 11
great-grandchildren.

GORE'S CAMPAIGN CHALLENGE: GENERATE MOMENTUM 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ These are frustrating times for the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is humming, unemployment is the lowest it's been in
decades, and crime is down dramatically _ just the environment, it
would seem, that would benefit the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   But Al Gore lags in the polls, and there is warm approval but
little excitement from the mid-sized crowds at Gore rallies and
open meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The throngs of people who waited hours in a town square, or
lined up along rural highways in 1992 to see Gore and
then-candidate Bill Clinton on their campaign bus tour aren't
showing up in the same strong numbers this year for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton and Gore spoke in downtown St. Louis eight years
ago at the end of their bus trip, the crowds were so thick a
latecomer could barely get a glimpse of the candidates on stage.
</P>
<P>
   But in the same venue this week, Gore supporters didn't even
fill Kiener Plaza, a downtown square where Gore and his running
mate, Connecticut Senator Joseph Lieberman, held an after-work
rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hot,'' explained one Gore supporter, fanning her face
with a Gore-Lieberman sign. ``A lot of teachers are starting back
next week'' and have to prepare their classrooms, suggested Cindy
Loehrer, a teacher herself. University students aren't back yet
from summer vacation, so they're not involved with the campaigns
yet, added Washington University student Jennifer Bers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore events are meticulously controlled; revelers at the St.
Louis rally, for example, had to have tickets, and several
complained they weren't told about the event early enough to tell
friends to attend. Ralliers were not allowed to bring their own
signs into the square.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's ``open meetings'' on issues are also planned, with some
individual questioners screened in advance by the campaign, which
provides biographies of the questioners before Gore appears.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gore's enemies don't seem that motivated; Gore rallies
typically attract at most a dozen or so antiabortion demostrators
or supporters of Republican nominee George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the politics of contentment,'' said Stephen Hess, a
poltical analyst withe the Brookings Institution in Washington.
``We get excited about elections when there's a war or the
economy's bad. It's very, very hard to start things up'' when the
nation is prosperous and at peace, he said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the challenge that faces Gore Thursday night as he
delivers his nomination acceptance speech: He will try, aides say,
to point out the policy differences that separate him from Bush, to
define himself in a personal way, and to emphasize the importance
of this election in guiding the nation's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a synthesis of his life experiences, both personal
and public, and the issues that are at the core of the campaign''
said Gore spokesman Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president is not likely to unveil any new policy
proposals Thursday night, aides said. Instead, he will detail his
plan for giving a middle-class tax cut, providing senior citizens
help in buying prescription drugs, and protecting Social Security
and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   That approach is meant as a contrast to the Republican National
Convention, which was heavy on the general message of restoring
character and integrity to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's speech will be ``optimistic and forward-looking,'' Lehane
said, and is not likely to include brutal criticism of the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will not be so specific that it will put you to sleep, but
it won't be so general he'll sound like a Republican,'' said Gore
senior adviser Greg Simon.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign aides insist they are not worried about the polls,
which have shown Bush ahead by as many as 19 points this month _
despite some polls that show a majority of the American public
agrees with Gore on many key issues. Gore aides attribute the
public mood to public disinterest in the campaign in general, and
they say the two candidates will be in a dead heat by Labor Day,
when Americans start tuning in to the contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could get 30,000 people here (in St. Louis) if we wanted to
spend two weeks and $15,000 doing it,'' a Gore aide said. ``We
decided not to do it that way.'' The strategy, the aide said, is to
slowly build up Gore as a man of substance and ideas, holding
smaller town meetings focused on various campaign issues to reach
the public.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is trying to get back some of the 1992 magic Friday, when
he embarks on a four-day, four-state riverboat cruise down the
Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   The event is being planned by Hollywood producer Mort Engelberg,
who helped develop the Clinton-Gore bus trip through middle America
eight summers ago. Engelberg's staging of the trip _ showing
Clinton and Gore in a folksy, populist mode _ made the tour one of
the turning points of the 1992 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to hit the river running,'' Lehane said, and
introduce the real Gore to the nation's heartland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vice presidents are historically famous, but not well-known,''
Lehane said. ``Right now, people are agreeing with where Al Gore
is. They just need to find out that fact.''

TIPPER GORE: A POTENT FORCE BEHIND THE MOM IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Because Tipper Gore's got a sunny smile, an
effervescent personality, and the perfect image of the mom next
door, her influence is often underrated. She has a powerful voice
in her husband's presidential campaign, but more than that, a
persuasive way with people she hardly knows.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Representative Patrick J. Kennedy, the Rhode Island
Democrat who invited Mrs. Gore into his district last winter to
speak at a forum on mental health. Before the event in Woonsocket,
R.I., was over, Kennedy shocked Mrs. Gore and his staff by
disclosing that he had suffered depression since boyhood, sees a
psychiatrist regularly, and takes medication for his illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another profile in courage!'' Mrs. Gore exulted,
congratulating Kennedy for a candor that's rare in public life.
While her ``courage'' reference was clearly to the Kennedys, the
characterization might just as well have applied to her.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, when she introduces Al Gore as a faithful
husband, great family man, and the party's presidential nominee to
the Demcratic convention and a national television audience, Tipper
Gore's considerable powers of persuasion will be on display. And so
will a woman who has been transformed by a quiet but bold act.
</P>
<P>
   A little over a year ago, as the vice president was gearing up
for a White House run, Mrs. Gore revealed that she had been treated
for depression. In 1989, the couple's son, Albert, was seriously
injured when a car hit him as he walked out of a Baltimore Orioles
baseball game. Mrs. Gore said she became ``overly stressed'' as she
held the family together and helped her son through his long
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore's disclosure of depression, which was unknown to even
her best friends, was deemed a political calculation: Tell the
story before a tabloid newspaper gets ahold of it and splashes
``Tipper: `I Took Drugs''' across its cover. Mrs. Gore says as the
president's mental-health adviser she is committed to removing the
stigma around mental illnesses. But no matter what the motivation,
the singular act has made her a heroine to many Americans who
relate to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   At a campaign stop in Gardner, Mass., last week, the crowd
cheered when Mrs. Gore was introduced as a champion of mental
health. Afterward, seated next to Hadassah Lieberman, who grew up
in Gardner and is married to Gore running mate Joseph Lieberman,
Mrs. Gore said the reaction used to surprise her, but it doesn't
anymore. Every place she visits, people come up and hug her, kiss
her, and thank her for breaking the silence on depression. Often,
she said, they share their own heartaches with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking about mental illness is a very important thing for
anyone to do, but to have Mrs. Gore do it _ it's a real opportunity
for people to admire her strength and have a role model,'' said
Judy Stoehr, who works at North Central Human Services in Gardner
helping people with mental illnesses find housing. Stoehr said she
came to the Gardner rally not to celebrate Mrs. Lieberman's
homecoming but to applaud what Mrs. Gore has done.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the revelation of her vulnerability has strengthened
Mrs. Gore. She is more confident, comfortable, and sober on the
stump than she was a year ago. Friends have seen her grow from a
supportive political spouse to a dogged and determined partner in
Gore's presidential race. She has always been her husband's best
friend; now she, her daughter Karenna Gore Schiff, and Frank
Hunger, Gore's brother-in-law, have become the most influential
faction within Gore's adviser-heavy campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gearan, who managed the Gores in the 1992 campaign, saw
Mrs. Gore's fingerprints all over the selection of Senator
Lieberman, someone she admires as a family friend, a good father,
and a vocal critic of Hollywood's exploitation of sex and violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that scene _ it was Tipper and Frank and Karenna _ and
at the end of the day that family nucleus, that triangle,
prevailed,'' said Gearan, a former Peace Corps director and now
president of Hobart and William Smith Colleges. ``Gore listens very
intently to Tipper; she has good judgment and great radar.''
</P>
<P>
   Questioned about her role in selecting Lieberman, Mrs. Gore's
smile disappears. ``This was Al's decision,'' she said firmly,
giving a scripted answer about the qualifications her husband
required in a running mate. But _ turning cheery again _ Mrs. Gore
acknowledged it was wonderful to share a campaign with people she
adores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so nice to have a friend along _ plain nice,'' Mrs. Gore
said, casting an affectionate glance at Hadassah Lieberman. ``We're
on the same wave length. There are a lot of things we don't have to
say; we just look at each other and know how we feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't be fooled, friends say, by the perky package and nickname
that came from a nursery rhyme. Tipper Gore, born Mary Elizabeth
Aitcheson, is very smart, savvy, and full of the emotional
intelligence and genuine warmth that her husband is hard-pressed to
convey. Mental health isn't just her primary issue; it is the
metaphor for her presence in Gore's life and presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tipper centers Al Gore. She gives him a dose of what he needs
when he needs it,'' said Marla Romash, who worked for Gore in the
White House. ``When he needs to laugh, she is the one who can make
him do it. When somebody needs to say, `You messed up,' she is the
one who can say it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore, who turns 52 on Saturday, met Gore after the senior
prom at the private St. Albans School in Washington and followed
her Harvard-bound boyfriend to Boston. In 1970, she graduated from
Boston University, married Gore, and moved to Tennessee. There she
got a master's degree in psychology, but before she could pursue a
career as either a child psychologist or a professional
photographer (to this day, she is never without a camera), her
husband got elected to Congress, and the Gores, both just 28,
headed back to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   While her husband moved up from the House to the Senate to two
terms as vice president, Mrs. Gore's assignment was to raise the
couple's four children and care for two sets of aging parents. Her
commitment to parenting, nurturing, and maintaining some privacy
and normalcy for herself and her children was profound. Mrs. Gore's
parents were divorced when she was very young. She grew up a
lonely, only child, raised in the Arlington, Va., home of her
grandparents because her mother was hospitalized from time to time
with severe depression.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt her life experiences made Mrs. Gore an advocate for the
sensitive subject of mental health. In fact, from her earliest days
in Washington, Mrs. Gore is remembered as a high-energy activist
who organized congressional wives to study social issues on the
cutting edge _ homelesness, mental health, learning disabilities,
the impact of technology, and most controversially, record lyrics
aimed at teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984 she was a founder of the Parents Music Resource Center,
which petitioned Congress and prodded the recording industry to put
warning labels on albums with raunchy lyrics. The mission was
successful _ the industry agreed to post parental advisories on
record labels _ but Mrs. Gore backed away from the leadership after
she got burned as a censor, a prude, and a liability to her
husband's White House ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   People close to her know she is none of those things. ``Anybody
who plays the drums as an adult woman is a person who knows how to
have a good time,'' says Rhoda Glickman, the wife of Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman who has seen a red drum set in the hallway
of the Gore home.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Downey, Mrs. Gore's best friend, admits she provided the
car the day Mrs. Gore was a rascal and tricked her Secret Service
agents into believing she was taking a short spin around the block.
Instead, she escaped to Starbucks for a private and leisurely
latte.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a just a very good person with a great heart who wants
to help,'' Downey said. ``Tipper is always trying to fix things
that are broken in people's communities and people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of her good works go unreported, in part because Mrs. Gore
is shy in the public eye and in part because she is too shrewd now
to let her passions embarrass her husband. Few people know she
entertains homeless people in the vice-presidential residence or
that she once escorted a woman who called herself ``Mary Tudor''
out of Lafayette Park and to the White House gates to prove that
President Clinton, whom Tudor believed was her husband, was not at
home. Mrs. Gore arranged temporary housing for the woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``She walks the walk and talks the talk,'' said Alfonso Guida,
executive director of the National Mental Health Awareness
Campaign, a five-year, public-private partnership Mrs. Gore
recently set up to combat misperceptions about mental illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In his convention address Monday night, President Clinton hailed
Mrs. Gore for ``bringing the cause of mental health into the broad
sunlight of our national life.'' Representative Kennedy is even
more effusive. ``She is my hero!'' Kennedy said in an interview,
recalling how Mrs. Gore ``warmed up the room and sent out vibes
that made me feel this would be the time'' to disclose his
depression to a roomful of seniors in Woonsocket.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates are just as impressed with Mrs. Gore's commitment to
and leadership on mental-health issues. Last year she hosted the
first White House conference on mental health and got the US
surgeon general to issue the first national report on the subject.
She lobbied Congress to provide mental-health coverage in the new
child-health insurance law and urged the president to issue an
executive order guaranteeing federal employees insurance parity for
mental illnesses. The 1996 Mental Health Parity Act, which Mrs.
Gore championed, was one of the only elements of Hillary Rodham
Clinton's health-care overhaul to become law.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Mrs. Gore expresses nothing but praise for the first
lady. But she has managed to be an unusually effective ``Second
Lady of Vice,'' as she sometimes jokes about her position, and push
a controversial agenda, while posing no political threat or
appearing to harbor personal ambition. Her record suggests that
unlike Mrs. Clinton, she would come to the White House with a
nuanced understanding of the power of a political spouse.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Mrs. Gore says she is focused only on the fall, when
she expects to balance campaign appearances centered on health
themes with babysitting her 1-year-old grandson, Wyatt. Thursday
night, her job is to give Americans a glimpse of the man she knows
best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically want to introduce Al in a way no one else can,''
Mrs. Gore said. ``I can really talk about him in very personal
terms, as a man completely devoted to his family and his faith and
his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``My role,'' she said, ``is to help as much as I can.''

FAMILY REUNIONS SHIFT ATTITUDES ABOUT KOREAN UNITY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SEOUL _ Koreans, north and south, have passed a lifetime
excruciatingly close together on the map but forced painfully apart
by politicians and armies defending a Cold War border.
</P>
<P>
   But ideology means little to a mother separated from her son, or
to a wife who has waited half a century for her husband to come
home. The day after their first tear-drenched reunions in 50 years,
200 divided Korean families withdrew behind closed doors Wednesday
to rediscover loved ones who have become strangers, to dust the
cobwebs off lost lives.
</P>
<P>
   With his long-lost brothers in a Seoul hotel room, Oh Yong Jae,
64, North Korea's most celebrated poet, bowed three times before a
photograph of his parents engraved on a black stone and read aloud
a poem dedicated to the mother he never saw again after he ran away
to join North Korea's army as a teenager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother, you said you wouldn't die until you saw me, but you
are gone. I don't want to believe it,'' he recited, his voice
trembling as his brothers wept quietly. ``But time has no mercy.
Let us reunify our nation. Leave the systems and ideologies. Let us
simply reunify.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh's words sounded the theme of this week's historic reunions,
and could be a harbinger of what many here see as a flash-flood
rappochement between the two long-time enemy states. The family
reunions are the most tangible fruit of the first-ever summit
meeting of the leaders of the north and south two months ago, which
grew out of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's ``sunshine
policy'' of engaging the Stalinist north, despite past broken
promises and military provocations by Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   The surprisingly friendly summit and the emotionally-charged
reunions have fired the imagination of a public that nurses deep
wounds over the long separation. Most South Koreans now say the
idea of reunion in the not-too-distant future with the communist
North seems workable and even desirable _ a notion that would have
been laughable to many here even a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   And if the speedy-unification message being parroted by the
North Korean visitors and state media this week is any barometer,
attitudes in the North have shifted as well.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's newspapers have stopped denouncing the South as
``the enemy.'' South Korea'a military has stopped referring to
``the northern puppet army.''
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's conservative opposition party, long wary of the
north, has dropped its objections to relaxing the anti-communist
security law, and even suggested that Seoul rewrite the
constitution to recognize Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   A South Korean government survey found that 97 percent of the
public saw the June summit as a success. Nearly 91 percent believe
the north is changing, and 77 percent are prepared to shoulder the
burden of investment to develop their cash-strapped, economically
backward neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit for post-summit euphoria goes to the
unexpected charm offensive by Northern leader Kim Jong Il _ the
first performance on the world stage for the previously reclusive
leader. His joking, boisterious TV manner has spawned ``Kim Jong Il
fever'' here, with on-line fan clubs and smiling dolls of a man
whom South Koreans were taught to revile as a freak.
</P>
<P>
   His gestures of amity in the last two months _ an invitation to
South Korean media executives and an array of proposals for new
cross-border links _ have taken South Korean policy makers by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how to react, to be honest,'' one official said.
``Now he says, `Let's have two more reunions.' Nobody knows what
he'll say next.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is ready to trust a regime that reneged on its
promises after previous rounds of diplomacy. But for a public
captivated by round-the-clock television images of the dramatic
family reunions, this time seems different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt today when I saw these reunions that all those old
leaders of South Korea cheated us _ we are victims of our past
governments who wanted to keep the Koreas apart,'' said Kim Young
Hwan, 43, a taxi driver. ``I cried when I saw those families so
long separated. . . . The gap between North and South Korea is big.
But if these kinds of reunions go on, step by step, (reunification)
can happen. The first and most important thing is to trust each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear how soon reunification would be feasible
between the south's vibrant democracy, boasting one of the world's
largest economies, and the north's authoritarian regime, with its
antiquated controlled economy in shambles. In a June newspaper
poll, three-fourths of South Koreans agreed that unification would
take five to 30 years. A study by economists for Goldman Sachs
estimated it would cost $1 trillion, much more than it cost West
Germany to absorb the East.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the pricetag, there is a generational divide among
South Koreans on the issue: older Koreans favor reunification, but
those too young to remember the war see Pyongyang as more foreign
than Taipei or New York. Only 30 percent of elementary through
college students surveyed after the summit said life would improve
if the Koreas reunited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time North Korea needs something from us, they ask for
it, and we get nothing in return,'' said Kim Yong Jae, 19, an
engineering student. ``I've talked to other students, and we
believe if (reunification) doesn't happen in 10 years, it'll never
happen, because by then, it'll be our generation running the show,
and we have nothing to do with the North.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are painful words for the older separated families who say
they want nothing more than to live their remaining years together.
Ryang Han Sang, a North Korean, waited 50 years to come south but
has been unable to see his 87-year-old mother, because she is too
weak to ride an ambulance to the hotel in which the
carefully-controlled reunions are being held.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't see my mother, then it would have been better if I
had not come,'' Ryang, 69, cried in agony to his brothers in a
hotel room. ``There are a lot of things to talk about after being
separated for 50 years.''

BRITAIN AND FRANCE OFFICIALLY RULE CONCORDE UNFIT TO FLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: UPDATES with France also ruling Concorde unfit, adds details
throughout; no pickup.) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British and French aviation regulators withdrew
airworthiness certification from the Concorde Wednesday,
effectively ruling the world's only commercial supersonic airliner
unfit to fly until it can be protected against the catastrophic
safety flaws behind last month's fatal crash near Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Narrowing their assessment of what caused the crash,
investigators said they believed that a tire blowout had sent
chunks of rubber flying into a fuel tank, rupturing it and causing
it to erupt in flames as the plane sped towards take-off at 195
miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, French investigators said a 16-inch piece of metal
on the runway had ruptured the tire, setting off the sequence of
apparently freakish events that caused the plane to crash within 90
seconds of takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is uniquely different in this case is that tire debris
alone is thought to have led to this catastrophic accident,'' said
Malcolm Field, the chairman of Britain's Civil Aviation Authority,
the regulatory agency that ordered the grounding of British
Airways' Concordes Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The revocation Wednesday of the Concorde's airworthiness
certificate _ the document that permits airplanes to fly in the
airspace of the authority that issues it _ was the first since U.S.
authorities grounded the McDonnell-Douglas DC-10 for five weeks in
1979, aviation experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Air France and British Airways _ the only airlines
operating the Concorde _ decide that it is technically and
economically feasible to modify the aircraft or introduce new
safety procedures, the process could take ``months rather than
weeks,'' said Mike Bell, a senior official from the Civil Aviation
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the assessment of some aviation industry analysts,
Kieran Daly, editor of Air Transport Intelligence, an aviation Web
site, said, ``It will be a finely balanced financial question
whether to do these modifications or not.''
</P>
<P>
   British Airways said it had canceled Concorde services through
early September but would resume them at 24 hours' notice if the
airworthiness certification were restored.
</P>
<P>
   Air France grounded its five remaining Concordes immediately
after the July 25 crash of New York-bound Concorde Flight AF 4590,
which killed 113 people in the first fatal accident involving the
prestigious, supersonic airplane. British Airways grounded its
fleet of seven Concordes on Tuesday after learning that the
airworthiness certificate would be revoked Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways gave no clear indication whether it believed the
aircraft, which crosses the Atlantic in around three and one-half
hours at up to twice the speed of sound, would ever return to
commercial service.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde has been plying scheduled transatlantic and other
charter routes for almost 25 years and had come to be seen as an
icon of prestigious travel for executives and celebrities ready to
pay up to $10,000 for a round-trip journey taking half the time of
a subsonic flight.
</P>
<P>
   As British Airways' flagship, the Concorde had also been seen as
an important magnet in drawing high-end travelers to the airline.
</P>
<P>
   Field, the chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, said
Wednesday: ``It is clear to all of us in the CAA that a tire
blowout alone should never cause the loss of a public transport
aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Field said the authority had asked Concorde's manufacturers, BAe
Systems, Airbus UK and Aerosaptiale of France _ to devise a plan to
insure that accidents could not be caused by tire blowouts. Under
aviation regulations, airplanes whose fuel tanks are vulnerable to
catastrophic damage from ruptured-tire debris may not be certified
as airworthy.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Concorde's spindly, stork-like landing gear is positioned
directly below the wings, fuel tanks and engines. But British
aviation experts say the British Concordes were modified to protect
the wings from damage by tire blowouts, while Air France Concordes
were not modified. Tire blowouts have been a worry for Concorde
pilots since the plane entered service in early 1976, according to
British aviation experts.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there have been seven known tire blowouts when
fragments struck fuel tanks without causing fires, the experts
said. The modifications to the British Airways Concordes in 1993
involved changes to a water deflector on the undercarriage to
``reduce the energy'' from a ruptured tire, according to Derek
Blackhall, the head of the certification section of the Civil
Aviation Authority. Air France Concordes did not have the same
modification.
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Bell, a senior Civil Aviation Authority official, told
a news conference that it was ``quite unique, an unprecedented
event'' for a tire blowout alone to cause an air disaster.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Field rejected the idea that the demand for modifications
effectively meant the Concorde would never fly again. ``We would
wish Concorde to fly again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Claude Gayssot, the French transport minister, also said
the measures did not necessarily imply the end of supersonic
travel. ``Anyone who says it's the end for supersonic flights has
got it wrong,'' he told the daily newspaper Liberation, ``Traveling
fast is going to be increasingly in demand.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A British investigator, Ken Smart, of Britain's Air Accident
Investigation Branch, said the precise links between the sequence
of events that doomed Flight AF 4590 last month remained to be
established in detail.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the damaged tire sent debris flying to puncture
one or more fuel tanks, allowing fuel to spill out and catch fire
within seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The airplane lost thrust in one engine, then in two. ``The crew
had no means to make them aware of the nature of the fire nor to
take action against it,'' he said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   He said the safety issues relating to the tires would take
``some time to resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   The head of France's Accident Investigation Bureau, Paul-Louis
Arslanian, told reporters in Paris: ``I hope the Concorde will fly
again, but I am an investigator of accidents, not a witch-doctor. I
cannot read crystal balls.''

MASS. TESTING SENIORS FOR NILE VIRUS INFECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Thirty-five ailing seniors in the Boston area have been
tested for the West Nile virus over the last month but none had the
potentially lethal infection, state health officals revealed
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ten more people with suspicious symptoms will be tested in the
next few days, they said.
</P>
<P>
   All the cases involved patients in area hospitals who had West
Nile-like symptoms: fever, headache, body aches, and occasionally
skin rash and swollen lymph glands. Some of the patients turned out
to be infected with the herpes virus. Three-quarters of the people
tested were from the greater Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   Regular human testing is a standard part of tracking viruses,
but is also a sign that health officials are taking the possibility
of human infections seriously. Although health officals said they
remain skeptical that any serious cases now exist, they said
continued testing is crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a case out there we want to know. It's important
to test samples every week,'' said Ralph Timperi, director of the
state lab where the tests took place. ``We expect to have a steady
stream (of human test samples) to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been just three diagnosed human cases of West Nile
Virus this year, all in Staten Island, NY. Health officials there
tested 269 people before finding them. Boston officals are actively
making the rounds of city hospitals looking for people with
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   To date, 12 infected birds and one group of mosquitoes have been
found. They have mostly been from the Jamaica Plain-Brookline area,
considered the state's only viral ``hot spot.'' Late Wednesday,
mosquito ground spraying was expected to take place in Jamaica
Plain, Brookline and Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   West Nile virus generally produces mild flu-like symptoms. It
can be fatal in 3 to 15 percent of cases, causing brain swelling or
encephalitis. Occasionally it causes meningitis, a less serious
inflammation of the membranes that surround and protect the brain
and spinal cord. The three Staten Island cases involved meningitis,
and all have since recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly are especially vulnerable to the virus. The patients
tested here were mostly between 50 and 70 years in age.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts has several hundred cases of encephalitis a year,
with dozens of different causes. The 45 patients that were referred
for testing typically had a bout of encephalitis without a clear
cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those encephalitis cases without an explanation, West Nile
virus is now one of the things we now think about,'' said Bela
Matyas, medical director of the state Department of Health's
epidemeology program.
</P>
<P>
   Matyas' staff is making weekly calls to the Boston hospitals
near the Jamaica Plain-Brookline hot spot, inquiring about
unexplained encephalitis cases.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, several of the 35 people tested were found to have the
herpes virus and some had enteroviruses, a common type of virus
that in some cases can cause encephalitis.
</P>
<P>
   The first and most lethal West Nile virus outbreak occurred in
Queens, N.Y. in 1999, where 7 people died and 62 were sickened.
After the initial outbreak subsided, officials found that 2.6
percent of the residents of that Queens neighborhood had been
infected but most had mild or no symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The state lab in Jamaica Plain is the only facility in the state
that has a West Nile virus sample to test human, bird, and mosquito
samples against. Hospitals have no way of spotting a case of the
virus on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting great cooperation from hospitals. When something
new like West Nile comes along, everybody is interested,'' said
Matyas.
</P>
<P>
   The mosquito population is now peaking and officals have
repeatedly warned the public to wear protective clothing, avoid
parks at dawn and dusk, use bug repellent and to empty containers
of standing water.
</P>
<P>
   The risk for infection remains miniscule, even in the Jamaica
Plain-Brookline hot spot. But some health experts assume that as
the summer wears on at least some people will become infected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think there would be some infections in the JP area,''
said Andrew Spielman, a professor of tropical public health at
Harvard' School of Public Health. ``I'm sure there are people out
there being bitten by mosquitoes.''

SPECIFYING THE AMOUNT OF GREEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (With DECORATOR-COST) 
By ELAINE LOUIE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are as many ways to bill a client as there are
designers and architects. The confusion arises when the client
doesn't know the real cost of things, be they bolts of fabric or a
contractor's fee. Fabric, for instance, may have a list price for
the public, and a net price that is 25 to 40 percent lower and that
is available only to architects and designers.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Sonet, the publicist for the Donghia furniture and textiles
company and who represented its founder, the late interior designer
Angelo Donghia, recounted Donghia's rule about charging: ``Where
there's mystery, there's distrust. There should only be one price,
which is the net price. You make your money by charging a fee for
your expertise and the design work.''
</P>
<P>
   But the day of one price, with every showroom open to the public
and all prices revealed, has not arrived. The happiest client is
the one whose decorator or architect quotes the price that he has
paid, along with the markup to the client.
</P>
<P>
   Antiques present a special problem. When an antiques dealer buys
something, ``he can mark it up any percentage,'' said Mario Buatta,
the interior designer. He continued: ``If I go into an antiques
shop, I get a discount between 20 and 25 percent, and I sell the
antique at the price the antique dealer has written on it. If a
desk is $10,000, I can't suddenly buy it at $10,000 and resell it
for $80,000, because everybody has seen it as $10,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are billing approaches taken by six Manhattan architects,
designers and shopping consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Buatta: For furniture and fabrics, Buatta pays the
discounted price, and the client pays either the list price, if the
goods come from a showroom, or, for antiques, the retail price
written on the tag. ``Go to Clarence House, the fabric showroom,''
he said. ``There's a list price of, say, $120 a yard. I pay $80,
the client pays $120.''
</P>
<P>
   If any construction is to be done, Buatta gives the contractor's
contract to the client, who pays the contractor directly. ``I
charge 25 percent of whatever the contractor charges,'' Buatta
said. ``It's too complicated any other way. All I have is the
design and supervisory fee, which is the 25 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   For out-of-town construction, Buatta charges a day rate of
$3,500 for occasional site visits, in addition to the fees already
mentioned for fabrics and furniture. ``But then I don't get 25
percent of the contractor's fee,'' he said, ``because I'm not there
to supervise it. They have to hire somebody else to supervise every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Post, interior designer: Post charges a one-time fee
based on the cost of the entire project _ including furniture,
fabric, lighting and construction _ and is set before the contract
is signed. For furniture and fabrics, clients pay the net price.
(Post pays with the clients' credit cards, keeping an itemized
list.) ``I don't care if they buy a Crate &AMP; Barrel couch, or spend
millions of dollars where everything is custom,'' Post said.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Gorlin, architect: For residential projects, Gorlin
charges 15 to 18 percent of the construction cost, which includes
appliances, custom cabinetwork, millwork and built-in lighting. For
furniture, draperies, rugs and fabric, he charges the discounted,
or net, price plus an hourly fee. ``They can see all the bills for
the furniture, draperies and rugs,'' Gorlin said. The hourly fee
ranges from $400 for Gorlin to $100 for a junior staff member.
</P>
<P>
   D'Aquino Monaco Inc.: Carl D'Aquino, an interior designer, and
Francine Monaco, an architect, use several approaches. ``Our books
are open,'' D'Aquino said. First, the client pays the net (or
discounted) price for fabric and furniture to showrooms that accept
the client's check. ``When a vendor won't accept a client's check
directly, we create a purchase order that we pay, and the client
reimburses us, knowing the exact fee,'' D'Aquino said. ``The
clarity is that the client knows the exact price of each and every
item they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the contract, the designers receive markups over net
price, one for the furniture, another for construction.
</P>
<P>
   For clients who appear indecisive from the outset, the firm
charges an hourly rate. The client pays the net price for
everything, plus an agreed-upon hourly fee that includes all work
done by the firm, whether by the partners or a junior designer.
``This method of payment would be to our benefit,'' D'Aquino said.
``The designer is protected.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the flat fee, one lump sum for all the
contracting, painting and furniture. This fee, specified in the
contract, works best with the most decisive clients.
</P>
<P>
   The Decoration and Design Building: Most of the showrooms in the
D&AMP;D Building, 979 Third Ave., are open to the trade only. But for a
client who wants to shop at the building, Charlotte Zaslav, who
works for the D&AMP;D management, will consult for $100 an hour and
shop with the client in the building's showrooms, buying goods at
the net price and charging a 15 percent commission. She can be
reached at (212) 759-6894.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Windman, interior designer and purchasing agent: Some
individual showrooms at the D&AMP;D Building, like Donghia, might
recommend someone like Windman, who will act as a purchasing agent,
or shopper, for a client who lacks a designer or an architect. ``If
they're hiring me as a purchasing agent, I'll charge them net price
plus an additional 20 percent,'' Windman said.

DOCTORS QUESTION HAND TRANSPLANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He can write his name, throw a ball, turn the pages of a
newspaper. He can sense heat and touch and he can feel pain.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Scott can do all that with his new left hand, the first
ever transplanted to an American. But beyond that, Scott has
overcome a major challenge: he has come to feel that a dead man's
very visible part sewn to his arm is now his own.
</P>
<P>
   But, 18 months after the operation, Scott's case at the center
of a debate over the ethics of offering such risky surgery to
people whose lives are otherwise healthy. While the hazards of
anti-rejection drugs may be acceptable in a heart or liver
transplant to save a patient's life, doctors are divided over
whether a new hand is worth the risk of life-threatening
complications.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, 39, whose extraordinary case is detailed for the first
time in the current issue of the New England Journal of Medicine,
lost his left hand in a fireworks accident in 1985. Until January
1999 he had a mechanical prosthesis.
</P>
<P>
   Since the transplant, a 15-hour-procedure followed by months of
physical therapy and slow recovery, Scott has ``showed a remarkable
psychological adaption'' that suggests he was mentally strong at
the outset, said Dr. Martin Klapheke, a member of the team that
carried out the operation in Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Scott has had three episodes in which his body tried to reject
the hand, but he has been remarkably free of complications except
for a long bout of stomach trouble and fatigue that had him
wondering if he'd done the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Klapheke said he was intially worried how Scott
would be affected when, soon after the operation, the media
breached confidentiality by naming the hand's donor, a 59-year-old
brain-dead man, and revealing ``tragic details'' of the donor's
life. But, said the psychiatrist, Scott remained stalwart. ``He
said `No, this is my hand . . . this is my blood pumping through
it, and I'm in control of it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The report in the New England Journal, by Drs. Jon W. Jones and
Warren C. Breidenbach of the University of Louisville School of
Medicine emphasizes the transplant's success to date, and the
doctors are planning to continue with them. A spokeswoman for
Louisville's Jewish Hospital, where the transplant was done, said
that over 300 potential candidates had contacted the team but for
one reason or another they were ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's success hasn't quieted medical and ethical concerns
about the transplants, and an editorial accompanying the report
calls for a go-slow approach.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James H. Herndon, chief of the Partners Health Care
orthopedic service in Boston, argues that regaining the use of a
hand doesn't justify subjecting patients to the risks of
anti-rejection drugs, which can lead to infections, lymphoma,
leukemia and other complications.
</P>
<P>
   Until better immuno-suppressive drugs come along, Herndon wrote,
the transplants should be limited to patients who are already
taking anti-rejection drugs for a life-threatening condition and
who also lose a hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard surgeon is one of four hand surgeons at
Massachusetts General Hospital and two at Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston who are part of the Partners orthopedics
department. The surgeons perform complicated re-attachments of
severed fingers and toes and repair congenital defects. But
Louisville is the only U.S. center that has taken on hand
transplants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think patients will probably push the demand'' for hand
transplants ``and a few more centers'' may begin the operations,
Herndon said. He said that the transplants are ``long and tedious''
but can be done successfully because surgeons have had years of
experience with re-implantations.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeons in Louisville continue to seek transplant
candidates who have lost one or both their hands or forearms in
accidents or because of medical treatment (though not cancer). They
are not offering transplants of individual fingers, or feet or
legs.
</P>
<P>
   Klapheke, the psychiatrist for the transplant team, said that he
was originally skeptical about the value of the transplants _ until
he talked to candidates. Although he said he was intellectually
aware of how crucial the hand is to one's body image and to
interacting with people _ and even feeling competent _ Klapheke
found their stories more poignant than he expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very powerful thing to talk to a number of these
individuals and understand how much longing they have to replace
that hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Louisville team leader Breidenbach said the limitations on
transplant candidates that Harvard's Herndon proposes would make it
virtually impossible to qualify patients for the surgery. He also
argued that the success of the hand transplant patients worldwide
suggest that the limits aren't needed.
</P>
<P>
   Breidenbach said Wednesday in an interview that he is ``very
pleased'' not only with Scott's progress but with the entire world
hand transplant experience so far. With eight hands transplanted in
six patients and up to a year and 11 months' followup, he said,
``there's been no loss of a transplanted organ. All the patients
are doing well'' except for the world's first hand transplant
recipient who has proven unreliable in taking his medication.

LATIN MUSIC CONFERENCE HIGHLIGHTS TALENT AND GROWING APPRECIATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Critic's Notebook)  
 By JON PARELES   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Latin Alternative Music Conference, which
presented performances and panel discussions from Saturday through
Tuesday, set out to be the start of something big.
</P>
<P>
   About 700 musicians, recording-company executives, radio
programmers, Web site operators and journalists registered for the
conference at the New York Hilton and Towers. Many more people
showed up to hear bands from Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Colombia,
Venezuela and Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And just about everyone believed that the music they love has an
audience eagerly awaiting it, if only they can make contact.
</P>
<P>
   It will take time and strategy. There is, of course, a language
barrier, though that has not stopped American and English rock from
being heard worldwide. And the music barely has a foothold on
American radio, where it's heard almost entirely on college or
public stations. Conference participants shared other ways to get
the music heard, with high hopes for satellite, cable and Internet
radio. Some compared the situation to collegiate rock in the early
1980s, when bands were just finding a circuit of clubs and college
gigs, and word of mouth meant survival.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before the spread of the Internet: With any luck,
the timetable will be faster for Latin alternative music.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the United States, the music faces the barriers of
national taste. Yet music video has bound Latin America together.
And Molotov _ a group of raucous, punk-rooted rappers who sometimes
tilt back toward Mexican rhythms _ has sold 1 million albums
worldwide, nearly a quarter of them in Spain. Molotov headlines the
Watcha Tour, a package of raucous rock en espanol bands, which
comes to the Tunnel in Chelsea on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Conference participants cited promising demographics,
particularly the growing number of Americans _ both immigrants and
native-born _ who speak Spanish and have a stake in more than one
culture. (Los Angeles County, which includes the factory town of
American entertainment, is projected to have a Hispanic majority
within the decade.) Whatever their roots, they've also been
bombarded by American pop, and there's no reason not to enjoy
whatever they want. Young Latinos and Latinas are bilingual and
used to crossing cultural borders; they don't have to shut anything
out. And as they casually juggle multiple idioms, they show how to
thrive in a globally networked 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much information that goes by,'' said Julieta
Venegas, a songwriter who grew up in Tijuana, Mexico, and is about
to release her second album. ``Naturally you learn to use it.''
Venegas is completely fluent in English, which she learned from
California television, but she writes in Spanish because, she says,
``I don't really feel things in English, and I don't want to fake
it.'' She sometimes plays a small Mexican accordion in her songs,
but she got the idea, she says, from hearing Joe Jackson and Tom
Waits. And her songs have the clear melodies and emotional impact
that could make listeners sing along before they worry about the
words.
</P>
<P>
   At the conference, no one tried to pin down a definition of
alternative. It is, in practice, music that's not heard on
commercial Spanish-language radio stations, which tend to play
salsa, sentimental Latin pop or established regional genres like
Mexican banda or Dominican bachata. Latin alternative tends to be
format-busting music. A band like Illya Kuryaki and the
Valderramas, from Argentina, is fully capable of using rapping,
rock guitars, Afro-Caribbean percussion and lounge-funk interludes
all in the same song, while the lyrics leap from personal
confession to social comment to surreal humor.
</P>
<P>
   The music already has a long pedigree. In Brazil in the late
1960s, rebellious rockers created tropicalia, embracing a giddy
modernity without forgetting homegrown traditions. Rock also got
footholds in Mexico, in Argentina and across Latin America, where
multinational marketing met a receptive public. In many places,
bands started out imitating foreign rockers while writing lyrics in
Spanish; gradually, however, local idioms peeked through.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the category rock en espanol has become far too
confining to hold music that stretches from Venegas' intimate pop
songs to the introspective rock of Aterciopelados to the funk of
Los Amigos Invisibles to the electronica of Nortec.
</P>
<P>
   The bands that performed during the conference rebounded Anglo
rock with their own warps and twists. Even when they dressed like
punks, band members were proficient musicians; they have to be to
slip in and out of multiple styles. A few, like La Ley _ one of
Chile's top bands _ simply imitated pompous '80s rock that sounds
shop-worn here. But Vallejo, a band from Austin that has songs in
English and Spanish, found a way to merge rap-metal with Southern
rock, Texas boogie and Caribbean rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   And Nortec, an electronica collective from Tijuana, calmly
bounced electronica across borders. The band's name comes from
norteno, the Mexican label for Tex-Mex music, and techno, and at
Irving Plaza on Tuesday night, the group projected videos and
slides with images of accordions, banditos and a digitalized
cactus.
</P>
<P>
   Its disc jockey-programmers built their music from cold
electronic tones that harked back to Kraftwerk, but also from the
sounds of the drums and cowbells in Mexican cumbia bands; one
segment took the beat of a norteno waltz and distorted it into a
techno chomp. It was recognizably local and internationally
up-to-date, and it was irresistible.

CHINESE EXPATRIATE ARTIST UPDATES MAOIST ICON AND ANGERS OLD GUARD

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ With a typically enigmatic installation that won high
honors at the most recent Venice Biennale, the expatriate
conceptual artist Cai Guo-Qiang has unexpectedly achieved every
artist's dream: He has provoked a debate, long overdue, in his
officially stifled native country about the meaning of art,
originality and the avant-garde.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of a lively discussion among artists and scholars
in seminars, journals and popular newspapers is Cai's partial
re-creation in Venice last year of a famous work of 1960s
propaganda called ``Rent Collection Yard.''
</P>
<P>
   The original, a Socialist Realist tableau of 114 clay sculptures
depicting the ways a cruel landlord exploited his peasants, still
stands where it was made, in a former landowner's courtyard in
Sichuan province. In the late 1960s and early 1970s during the
Cultural Revolution, it was praised by Mao's powerful wife, Jiang
Qing, and fiberglass duplicates toured China and other Communist
countries.
</P>
<P>
   To Cai's professed astonishment, his anachronistic
reconstruction of this icon of class struggle in the rarefied air
of the Venice Biennale _ he describes it as a meditation on time,
sculpture and history _ has stirred outrage in China, and the
startling threat of a lawsuit. One critic denounced his work as a
post-modern approach to post-colonial imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   The debate began in earnest this spring when some of the
original 1960s sculptors at the Sichuan Academy of Art in Chongqing
announced plans to bring legal action against Cai and the Biennale
for copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   To outsiders accustomed to the role that appropriation plays in
contemporary art, such a lawsuit may occupy a position between
naive and absurd, especially since it involves a collectively
produced work of public art made in an era when the very idea of
intellectual property was spat upon.
</P>
<P>
   But the ensuing debate has exposed the wildly different artistic
sensibilities that coexist in China today, as well as the
nationalistic resentment stirred by Chinese artists who succeed
abroad. Most instructively, it has brought out defenders who are
trying to explain just why a modern work like Cai's can carry a
meaning different from its source. ``This debate has become a work
of performance art in itself,'' said Wang Mingxian, a Beijing art
historian. Wang extols the visual power of the original tableau,
but along with many Beijing intellectuals he appreciates Cai's use
of it in a radically different time and place, calling the Venice
project a provocative transformation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this will lead to something positive,'' Wang said.
``Chinese people don't know a great deal about contemporary art,
and they don't know what performance art is.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have not spoken out so far on the matter,
but China remains a Communist dictatorship whose bureaucrats say
that art should serve the people and who often forbid
installations, performance art and oddity of any sort in public
exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, in Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu and other
cities, clusters of frustrated artists are in touch with the
creative frontiers in New York or Berlin and stage brief
exhibitions or guerrilla performances in private.
</P>
<P>
   The attackers say that Cai doesn't know much about sculpture _
he had a team of Italians and Chinese create the figures step by
step in front of viewers in Venice _ and he didn't invent anything
new. So what exactly did he contribute?
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply believe that Cai Guo-Qiang has violated our creative
rights,'' said Wang Guanyi, a 64-year-old professor at the Sichuan
academy who helped make the original tableau in 1965. ``He did this
without our approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might say that this is common in the world of modern art,''
Wang said in an interview, ``but as far as I'm concerned he did
nothing creative. Cai Guo-Qiang has exploited the weighty and
profound impact of the original `Rent Collection Yard.'''
</P>
<P>
   In an article in the magazine Sculpture, Wang wrote: ``This is
different from Duchamp painting a mustache on the `Mona Lisa,'
because in that case the copyright protection time had expired. If
da Vinci and Duchamp were both alive today, they would surely end
up in a copyright suit.''
</P>
<P>
   A team of lawyers is working to build the infringement case,
though they have not yet decided in what legal venue, if any, they
can proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The charge of creative theft has been accompanied by strident
personal attacks involving Cai's expatriate status. Cai, who was
born in 1957, left for Japan in 1986 and later moved to New York.
With acclaimed installations in Japan, Europe, the United States
and Australia, he is one of a handful of Chinese-born stars on the
global art scene.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his best known events, he ignited a spiral of
helium-filled balloons and firecrackers in downtown Hiroshima,
creating the impression of terrible fires being sucked back into
the earth; next month he plans a large installation at the Museum
of Modern Art in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese press has gleefully quoted academic critics who
belittle his work, describing Cai a ``green card artist'' or a
``banana man'' _ yellow on the outside, white on the inside. Such
critics accuse him of pandering to malicious Western
misconceptions, in the case of the Venice exhibit, scoring easy
points by mocking the excesses of Mao's Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   In a newspaper interview, Dao Zi, an art critic and teacher at
the Sichuan Academy of Arts, called the original ``Rent Collection
Yard'' ``a milestone in the history of modern Chinese art.'' He
condemned Cai's collaboration with Harald Szeeman, the director of
the Biennale, who had been fascinated by the original ``Rent
Collection Yard'' and encouraged Cai to take on the project.
</P>
<P>
   Dao calls this an example of post-colonial cultural imperialism
in which China is demonized as backward and despotic. What's more,
he charges, Cai is ``using the approaches of postmodern art and his
privileges as a `green-card artist' to ingeniously violate
copyright law.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese of any background might be forgiven some bewilderment
about the high honors awarded to Cai at the Biennale, where he won
one of three international prizes. In its brief citation, the jury
praised the work as ``strong and surprising and perfectly balanced
in its space'' and noted how ``the artist questions the history,
function and the epic of art through temporal and physical
contextual isolation.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Cai spoke enthusiastically about the layered
meanings of his Venice version of ``Rent Collection Yard,'' which
he insisted was not a high-camp parallel to Warhol's Mao portraits.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had long been thinking of an installation based on
the fluidity of time and that he was attracted by the narrative
qualities of the Sichuan tableau, a version of which he saw as a
youth.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   By showing the process by which the work took shape in Venice,
he said, ``apart from the narrative depicted in the story, the
sculptural process was also depicted as a story.'' Because the clay
in Venice was not fired, it began cracking during the show, he
explained, evoking ``a life and death cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   Another inherent ``time line,'' Cai said, was the history of
realistic sculpture, which began in the West but was taken up in
the Soviet Union and China just as the form was being all but
abandoned by mainstream artists in the West. Creating the sculpture
in Venice, a seat of Renaissance art, added resonance, he said.
``You think of sculpture as dead, but there you saw it being reborn
again.''
</P>
<P>
   In this final Biennale of a century that witnessed the rise and
fall of socialism, Cai said, the work also evoked the relationship
between art and politics. Watching the sculptors create the
figures, viewers got a sense of the noble sincerity of the original
artists, he said. Yet, he went on, today's viewers can also
recognize the tragedy of such artists being used by the state.
</P>
<P>
   The partly completed work was finally left to disintegrate,
another sign, Cai said, that ``the process was most important, not
the work itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Szeeman, who as Biennale director is another potential target of
the lawsuit, said: ``Cai was making his interpretation of a great
monument. It could only be done by an artist with his modern
sensibility.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Part of the intense interest in the project, Szeeman said in a
telephone interview, reflects the recent shift toward figurative
art as many Westerners grow weary of abstraction.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing in June, the editors of the magazine Avant-Garde
Today held a seminar on the dispute that was attended by numerous
influential Chinese artists, critics and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think nearly everyone at the forum felt that Cai's
`Venice-Rent Collection Yard' was a valuable work,'' said Shi Jian,
an editor of the magazine. ``Whatever differences of opinion there
are about it shouldn't be settled legalistically. After all, in
modern art, appropriation and quotation of previous work and
traditions are very common.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole dispute reflects different understandings of what
art is,'' he said. ``Chinese art has been going through massive
changes, and the dispute reflects the clash of different ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Such debate is healthy, Shi said, because ``it's forcing art
critics to shift from being purely concerned with the art itself to
engaging the wider culture _ considering how art relates to
society, politics and law.''
</P>
<P>
   Cai, who has followed the debate from afar, said he had
initially been startled by the nationalistic attacks on his work,
but was now happy to see a counterreaction building on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many years Chinese artists working abroad were pretty much
dismissed within China, seen as living in a separate world,'' he
said. Now artists and critics in China ``see that what is happening
in the outside world really does affect them.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate has also provided a rare opportunity, he said, for
contemporary art to be discussed outside of elite circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese artists and critics living abroad are very much
interested in reaching the people of China,'' Cai said. ``And I
hope that students and artists in China will show more interest in
the ideas and struggles of Chinese artists abroad.''

DEMOCRATS SEND MIXED MESSAGES FROM LA 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For sheer, stark television drama, Bill Clinton's lonely walk
down the corridor before his Monday night speech was the highlight
of the Democratic convention. ABC anchor Peter Jennings said the
president's solitary journey ``has a rather strange look to it,''
while his NBC counterpart, Tom Brokaw, called it ``an appearance
that was worthy of a retiring rock star.''
</P>
<P>
   Once on stage, Clinton, the best White House TV performer since
Ronald Reagan, galvanized the convention crowd by asking, ``Are we
better off today than we were eight years ago?'' But when he
finished, the pundits were quick to pinpoint his role as
double-edged sword.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the president didn't talk about tonight was `Clinton
fatigue' and the people who have lost some respect for him,'' noted
NBC's Tim Russert. In describing how Clinton fatigue and foibles
were bleeding onto Al Gore's candidacy, Brokaw bluntly compared the
vice president to the student blamed in class ``when the teacher
turned around and pointed at the wrong guy.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Globe, CNN senior analyst William
Schneider said that to be effective, the Democratic convention
needed to pull off a ``Tennessee two-step, embracing Clinton's
policies while distancing Gore and Lieberman from his behavior and
values.''
</P>
<P>
   As CBS anchor Dan Rather put it, the gatherings in Philadelphia
and Los Angeles are little more than ``a tightly scripted
infomercial.'' (CBS actually aired a wistful ``The Way We Were''
piece recalling the days when nominating conventions were actually
exciting.)
</P>
<P>
   In that framework, the Republicans who met in Philadelphia two
weeks ago had to make an ``infomercial'' to convince independent
voters that George W. Bush was leading an inclusive, moderate
Republican Party into battle. In Los Angeles, the trailing Gore
campaign had a trickier task, trying to balance and ultimately sell
an ``infomercial'' of dueling images to the viewing audience.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was the difficult parlay of Clinton, mastermind of
the economic recovery and Clinton, the scandal-tainted sinner. Then
there was the dicey choreography of bringing home the hard-core
liberal base while convincing critical swing voters that the
Gore-Lieberman ticket was comfortably centrist.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, ABC's Sam Donaldson shrewdly noted that ``the
Republicans were successful . . . in Philly by sending a (message)
that was hot, straight, and true.'' The Democrats in Los Angeles,
he added, were exhibiting a collage of ``mixed messages.'' Even
their convention music seemed to suffer from a split personality.
While the strains of the forward-looking ``Don't Stop Thinking
About Tomorrow'' reverberated in the hall following Clinton's
Monday speech, Senator Edward Kennedy's ascension to the podium on
Tuesday was greeted by the nostalgic tune ``You're Still the One.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was a story line that dominated early television
coverage of the convention it was Gore's need to first bring
Democratic voters back into the fold. With PBS commentator Mark
Shields noting that Bush already had more than 90 percent of the
Republicans behind his candidacy and Russert stating that Gore, in
contrast, had slightly less than three-quarters of Democrats in his
camp, the math dictated the images the Democrats needed to display.
</P>
<P>
   And so, in the words of ABC commentator George Stephanopoulos,
Tuesday was ``liberals night. They're gonna give the liberals
old-time religion.'' CNN commentator Tucker Carlson was less
polite, characterizing the lineup as ``so retro . . . the old face
of the Democratic Party.'' And PBS's Paul Gigot dubbed it ``Ralph
Nader night without Ralph Nader.''
</P>
<P>
   The crucial prime-time speeches belonged to Kennedy and his
niece Caroline, whose discomfort in the limelight was painfully
evident on television. But those watching the cable coverage
earlier in the evening witnessed a parade of party heavyweights
from the bygone days before the centrist Democratic Leadership
Council began setting the ideological tone and agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran liberal war horses Mario Cuomo and Walter Mondale both
showed up on ``Larry King Live,'' and the most rousing television
performance of the evening came from Jesse Jackson, who opened the
party's tent flaps as wide as possible by declaring that ``this
Democratic convention is set in that great divide between Beverly
Hills and South Central.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, some commentator reaction to Jackson's fiery partisan
speech _ at one point he delighted delegates by ticking off the
names of such conservative Republican foes as Senators Strom
Thurmond and Jesse Helms _ highlighted the difficulty of the
Democrats' balancing act.
</P>
<P>
   Russert called the speech ``very partisan and directed at the
base,'' but suggested it was not as politically effective as the
more mainstream appeal General Colin Powell displayed for the
Republicans in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   On CNN, Salon.com Washington correspondent Jake Tapper wondered
aloud if the Democrats hadn't made ``a big tactical mistake'' on
Tuesday. ``The whole evening just recalls 20 years ago,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But at this year's Democratic convention, another night means
another televised message, one foreshadowed on Tuesday night when
ABC's Michel Martin hauled out the damning statistic that ``Gore is
losing the white male vote by a margin of 2 to 1.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, her colleague Cokie Roberts was proposing a
remedy for that problem. ``Tomorrow night and the next night,'' she
told viewers, ``it's on to the Independents.''

<P>
   After Al Gore ran for president in 1988 and lost, just as he
turned 40, he organized a series of dinners where he went around
the room and asked each person to tell him where he had gone wrong.
What hadn't he known? What hadn't he done?
</P>
<P>
   It was excruciating, his friends said, but he insisted on
hearing the bad news _ in detail _ about a campaign that had
started out as an environmental crusade and ended as a New York
food fight. He heard that he had no economic vision and that he had
talked about technology and the environment in ways that people
could not understand. Oh, and his speaking style needed a ton of
work.
</P>
<P>
   Gore responded, as he always has, by going back to school. He
put together a graduate seminar for one, complete with a syllabus
and a heavy-duty reading list, and applied himself to the serious
study of tax policy and business history. He brought in a
mathematician to explain chaos theory. And he hired a speech
consultant and a dance coach _ ``a ballet type,'' he told one
friend _ to help him move more fluidly.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians often learn from and are even transformed by a good
drubbing at the polls, but few have pursued their lessons as
aggressively as Gore. No one can say that the man who will accept
the Democratic Party's nomination for the presidency Thursday night
has not diligently readied himself.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all this extensive preparation has not showed in the Gore
campaign, which at least until recently has seemed surprisingly
unfocused. while Gore been training to govern from quite a young
age, he has always had mixed feelings about the path to power that
is politics.
</P>
<P>
   He is a student by nature _ even after Vietnam, he treated his
moral hangover with a year of divinity school, saying he wanted to
impose some structure on the exercise. His extraordinary
willingness to learn and change has taught him much, but has also
left him wide open to the charge that he is constantly reinventing
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Reinvention isn't all bad. Back in 1981, when he was concerned
about where the Cold War was headed, Gore turned himself into a
bona fide arms-control expert in a single year by plunging into the
arcana of a subject he had previously known almost nothing about.
In the '90s, he got way out front in learning about issues that no
one else was paying much mind, like information technology and
global warming.
</P>
<P>
   ``His education is ongoing,'' said his Harvard friend Tommy Lee
Jones, the actor. ``Where 20 years ago he would have made outlines
with Roman numerals, now it would look like rectangles on top of
each other, equally well organized but not so linear, and probably
three-dimensional.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet this quality has been nothing but trouble for Gore in the
current campaign, mostly noted through small but symbolic personal
alterations, like his new Palm Pilot and his switch from dark suits
to earth tones _ changes that are insignificant in themselves, but
resonate because they remind many people of the way he's shifted on
some key issues, particularly gun control and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   It is the same story with his work ethic _ something Americans
profess to love. As a senator, Gore was so determined to shoehorn
extra work into his day that during weekends of back-to-back town
hall meetings he would get himself booked in two places at the same
time _ a trick that was possible, barely, because Tennessee
straddles two time zones.
</P>
<P>
   He adored the illusion of time-bending, a former aide said.
``I'd tell him, `You just missed 400 people in Knoxville because we
crossed back to some backwater county to see three people.' And
he'd say, `Yeah, but we get an extra hour.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is someone who makes all his hard work look like ... hard
work. Lacking the smooth moves of either his boss, Bill Clinton, or
his Republican opponent, George W. Bush, Gore is a plodder, who
hopes to be a tortoise to Bush's hare.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more going on than raw effort. Gore's intellect and
the willingness to use it are probably his most important assets.
His Harvard mentor, the presidential scholar Richard Neustadt, has
said that compared with American presidents in this century,
probably only Theodore Roosevelt had a keener mind. Gore's friends
often see him as a visionary.
</P>
<P>
   His oldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, said: ``He likes to
ask, `What's the assumption here? What if we subvert it?' and one
of the things he could maybe do well if he wins the job is make new
connections, like between the economy and the environment, and ask,
`What if we were the leading exporter of ways to clean up the
environment?'''
</P>
<P>
   Those are not the kind of connections that crowds thrill to,
though. All Gore's smarts do not necessarily translate into an
ability to sway the public with feeling, as well as facts _ as he
is all too aware.
</P>
<P>
   One Clinton Cabinet member says that the interesting thing about
watching Gore in a meeting is the way he reasons, relying less on
anecdote and more on all that is known about a given topic than
most politicians do. Again, this is both a strength, because he is
able to analyze options dispassionately, and a liability, because
he fails to fully understand how important human stories are in
communicating about policy with the public.

 &HT;    UNC expands wireless learning
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. _ Arriving on Wednesday for the start of his
junior year, Mike Trinh said he was feeling the pang of ``e-mail
withdrawals.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as the 19-year-old at the University of North Carolina
at Chapel Hill wanted to hook up his computer to the Internet, his
dorm room was a mess of disassembled beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, I'd already be wired up,'' Trinh said.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from start-of-the-school-year housekeeping lapses, North
Carolina's flagship public university is taking major steps to
connect its students with computers.
</P>
<P>
   UNC-Chapel Hill is the latest _ and it says the nation's biggest
_ university to require undergraduates to own laptop computers.
</P>
<P>
   The college also is developing a wireless network that allows
users to connect to the Internet without plugging directly into the
university's high-speed data network.
</P>
<P>
   ``When students can take their computers and actually log on to
the Internet sitting under a tree or on a park bench, that's an
incredible technology,'' said James Moeser, UNC's new chancellor.
``It is going to transform the way learning takes place on the
campus.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the distribution of laptops to 3,400 freshmen, the
university says all of its approximately 15,000 undergraduates will
have laptops in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, nine out of 10 college students are connected to the
Internet, according to the research firm Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 colleges are equipping their students with laptops,
said Kenneth Green, director of the Campus Computing Project, which
studies the role of information technology in higher education.
</P>
<P>
   Technicians have installed around campus 20 devices that allow
wireless laptop users to connect to UNC's data network _ without
the typical modem or phone line connection over a cable.
</P>
<P>
   Laptop users must be within about 50 feet of the devices,
initially installed in the student union, the Davis and House
libraries, the main dining hall and several other locations.
Another wireless venue is the Pit, an outdoor brick seating area
that's a popular gathering place for students.
</P>
<P>
   To work with UNC's fledgling wireless network, a laptop must be
equipped with an access card, which students can check out at the
campus library for three hours, or can buy in the student store for
about $150.
</P>
<P>
   The wiring of UNC is no less crucial ``than running water or
plumbing,'' said William Friday, UNC's president emeritus. ``You
have to deal with the age you are in.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Gogan, UNC's director of networking and communications, said
the wireless network will supplement _ not replace _ the extensive
network of wiring at the school. For more than a decade, UNC has
been wiring dorms, classrooms, libraries and other buildings to
connect to its data network.
</P>
<P>
   But Gogan said wireless networking is more suitable in public
gathering places and in classrooms that can't easily be wired
because professors, for instance, move chairs for different
classes.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1998, the university has encouraged students to buy
laptops, before requiring freshmen to do so this school year.
</P>
<P>
   In a voluntary program last fall, nearly two-thirds of freshmen
bought laptops and participated in pilot programs to help faculty
members plan for this fall.
</P>
<P>
   At UNC, students use personal computers and computers in
university labs to swap e-mail and, increasingly, to visit class
Web pages to check assignments and grades and do classwork.
</P>
<P>
   Laptops, administrators say, will allow students to take notes
during classes and connect with the Internet in buildings across
campus.
</P>
<P>
   UNC has adopted two models of the IBM ThinkPad laptop.
University officials say, so far, more than nine in 10 freshmen
have bought their laptops through UNC, which has made arrangements
for students to borrow money to buy the computers at a relatively
low interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, up to $3 million is available in grants to freshmen
who can't afford to buy the laptops, which can cost as much as
$2,924. The grants are redeemable at UNC Student Stores.

<P>
   Gore is genuinely in love with the world of ideas, loves nothing
more than a good kibbitz about the multiverse, and apparently sees
how fractal geometry might improve our lives.
</P>
<P>
   He is a sucker for fun facts, too _ and always alert for
openings to share them. During his campaign visits to schools, he
has delivered spontaneous lectures on the Ice Ages, the Industrial
Revolution and the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview in his car, while en route to a New York
fund-raiser in the Hamptons, he started to explain how Long Island
was formed, then thought better of it and stopped himself. At
another point in the ride, he cried, ``Look at that!'' and pointed
to a sign about an exhibit called `Black Whalers.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know about the black whalers?'' he asked, very excited,
and went on to tell the history of the African-American community
in Sag Harbor, N.Y. ``I'm hoping they can find somewhere for me to
go to church here tomorrow, but my staff wants me to go to a diner
instead,'' he said, making a face. ``Better pictures,'' he added,
and rolled his eyes. (In the end, he did go to the church.)
</P>
<P>
   He seems to have quite a rich emotional life _ is clearly still
over the moon for Tipper, his wife of 30 years, and enviably close
to their four children. By all accounts, he is someone who actually
listens to his friends.
</P>
<P>
   He's also big on small gestures, like having a neatly pressed,
beautifully boxed $5 bill delivered to a consultant, Robert Shrum,
in his London hotel room last year after he lost a bet about
whether another top aide, Carter Eskew, was planning to propose to
his girlfriend. (Gore bet against true love and lost.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, he struggles with the kind of connections that most City
Council members find effortless.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent campaign stop in New York, where he had just
appeared on NBC's  &UR; ` &LR; `Today Show,' &UR; ' &LR;  he was working one end of a
crowd outside Rockefeller Center and TV weather man Al Roker was
working the other. It wasn't a fair match-up, because Roker had a
camera crew in tow, but the crowd did seem more enthusiastic about
meeting the other Al.
</P>
<P>
   Except for one middle-aged woman, who was jumping up and down
and clearly could not wait to greet the vice president. Yet when he
reached her, he not only failed to milk the moment, he raced
through it _ his eyes instinctively, and much too quickly, cutting
to the next person on the rope line, in search of someone who was
not quite as eager to meet him.
</P>
<P>
   At 52, Albert Arnold Gore is without question a complicated man.
He is a native of Washington, where he met the men who ran the
world through his father, Sen. Albert Gore, an up-from-nothing
child of the Depression whose stands for civil rights and against
the Vietnam War were out-of-sync with his Tennessee constituents
and cost him his seat in 1970. Yet young Al Gore had something of a
double life even in the capital, where he attended elite schools
yet dressed in a cousin's hand-me-downs and lived in a four-room
hotel suite because it was owned by a relative who gave his family
a break on the rent.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a real Tennesseean, who spent summers there, working
hard on the family farm, and while there he made his closest
friends, many of whom remain in his life today.
</P>
<P>
   He is someone who prays over meals and quotes the Bible. But he
is also devoted to science, and spends the time he's in the
helicopter en route to Air Force Two reading magazines like Nature,
Science and Discover.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his most deeply felt positions _ in support of both free
trade and the labor unions, for example _ create political
contradictions. And sometimes, he seems to be fighting himself as
much as he is Bush.
</P>
<P>
   He is on the one hand an incredibly careful man, yet at least at
times has been unusually willing to make himself vulnerable, as he
did in writing ``Earth in the Balance,'' a deeply confessional
environmental manifesto in which he ties man's mistreatment of the
environment to a lack of deep connection in dysfunctional families.
</P>
<P>
   One knock against Gore is that he has not shown himself to be
sufficiently human. But it may be that he has shown himself to be
all too human, someone who does sweat the small stuff and is cursed
with a level of self-awareness that does not appear to trouble
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, there was a million-dollar bash in the Hamptons in his
honor. Fireworks were in the offing, but they started badly, and he
had already turned to leave when they suddenly erupted into a
splendid celestial spectacle. Gore wandered out onto the lawn, by
himself, for a better look.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the time, he stood there alone, his silhouette rigid and
even lonely against the blazing night sky. Only when the model
Christie Brinkley playfully started snapping his picture did he
seem to realize he was supposed to look relaxed, like he was having
a good time.
</P>
<P>
   And from remarks he made later, it was clear that he had been
thinking about his quest to become president and whether he was
falling short. As he bid farewell to his hosts and guests, who had
paid $10,000 each to have dinner with him, he drew a pointed
analogy between the initial fizzle of the fireworks and his own
trajectory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that some of you were feeling momentarily disappointed
with the fireworks,'' he said. ``Some of you felt let down. Some
were even heart-broken. But you believed it was going to happen,
and it did. And I know that during this campaign, some of you have
felt like there were times when you wondered how it was going to
go.''

 UNDATED: to go.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On this particular occasion, the vice president pulled himself
back from the brink of further reflection and promised, from then
on, to do better.
</P>
<P>
   But in a life of constant movement and all-too-brief,
``good-to-see-you, good-to-see-you''-type encounters, Gore is an
unusually reflective person, and someone who thinks in a highly
psychological way.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, after his then-6-year-old son ran into the street
and was hit by a car right in front of him, Gore did what one
friend called ``psychotherapy by correspondence course,'' _ trying
to puzzle through his life, typically, by reading and listening to
personal development tapes.
</P>
<P>
   He passed out copies of a couple of the psychological texts he
was especially struck by, including one called ``How People
Change,'' by Allen Wheelis.
</P>
<P>
   In it, the author describes how he developed anxiety attacks as
a result of the summer that his cruelly demanding father made him
cut their lawn with a hand razor. And it is impossible to read it
without thinking of the summer that Gore's own father put him
through an equally pointless character-building exercise, making
him clear 20 hilly acres with a hand ax.
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing would have taken just a few hours with a
bulldozer, as Gore's high-school girlfriend in Tennessee, Donna
Armistead, remembers it. ``One day I stopped by, and he had got in
a nest of hornets. The poor guy was eaten up, but it didn't
matter,'' she said bitterly. ``His dad said it had to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, amid the craziness of the campaign, Gore is a highly
interior person, who can withdraw deep inside himself quite
suddenly. He loved the wild, dark, out-there movie ``Being John
Malkovich.'' As opposed to Bush, who says the last movie he enjoyed
in a theater was ``Forrest Gump.'' One relative describes Gore as
``very edgy'' in a business that does not award a lot of points for
edge.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Gore had seemed happy as a student at Harvard, where he
was after all facing service in Vietnam, his mentor, Neustadt,
said, ``I'd have called him an intellectually interested kid, a
questioning, pondering kid. In social situations, he was pleasant,
and capable of enjoyment, but happy? There were always a lot of
issues Al was concerned about morally. I wouldn't have called him
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet not, it would seem, because he suffers from a lack of
confidence; This is a man who applied only to Harvard because it
never occurred to him that he wouldn't get in. When he became a
newspaper reporter, he seems to have assumed he would follow in the
footsteps of David Halberstam, a friend of his sister's, who had
won a Pulitzer Prize. He ran for Congress at 28 and began mounting
his first presidential campaign only 10 years later. If elected, he
would have been the youngest president in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   He was not ready, as it turned out, and he ended up an observer
in his own campaign, watching his surrogate, New York City Mayor Ed
Koch, fight the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Gore's one friend among other
Democrats in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statements made by Mayor Koch took me by surprise,'' Gore
said in a recent interview. ``I had no advance notice, was not
happy about it and didn't handle it very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gore himself had snidely knocked Jackson, saying the country
was electing a president, not a preacher. Then he was overwhelmed
with guilt, horrified in particular by the racial implications of
the ongoing Koch-Jackson feud that he should have been aware of
when he sought an alliance with Koch. In the campaign's final days,
Gore was asking Jackson's forgiveness on an almost daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   Why would anyone have believed they were ready at that age?
</P>
<P>
   Gore had been a virtual grown-up since he was a kid, expected to
perform in the company of important adults. He had seen the
nation's leaders up close, and had not been daunted.
</P>
<P>
   In his first Senate term, which began in 1985, he was already
bored. And he simply could not wait to lead, he said, to take the
country where he felt it ought to go.
</P>
<P>
   His father was pushing him, even playing on his emotions by
saying he wanted to see his boy elected president before he died.
But aides say he was at least as influenced by the simple
availability of cash from the party's money men, once it became
clear that neither Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York nor Sen. Dale
Bumpers of Arkansas would make the race in 1988. And Gore's head
was turned by the media _ Washington reporters who in those days
could not get enough of him.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite two years after he was elected to the Senate, talk
show host John McLaughlin said to Gore during a television
interview: ``You've got the magical name _ Al Gore. Your father was
in Congress for 32 years. You've got character, you've got no clay
feet, no skeletons showing. You're intelligent. You're
well-informed. You've got a Vietnam War record. You've been an
investigative reporter, and you've got religious coloration, too.
</P>
<P>
   For one year you were a divinity student, and you're a devout
Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   You're almost too good to be true. Are you too good to be
true?''
</P>
<P>
   (Gore's answer, for the record: ``I don't know.'')
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's impeachment and Gore's own role in the fund-raising
scandals of recent years took care of that perception, of course.
And he can't say his mother hadn't warned him.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the mid-'80s, Dr. James Fleming, a Nashville physician
who was a friend of Gore's sister's and for a time the family
doctor, remembers a conversation at the family farm in Carthage
about then-Governor Clinton, who had just visited Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's mother, Pauline LaFon Gore, who like his father had grown
up poor and put herself through law school, has often been
considered the political brains in the family. And on this
occasion, she was adamant. ``She said he had bad moral character,''
Fleming said. ``She said, `Bill Clinton is not a nice person. You
shouldn't associate too closely with him.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gore went on the ticket with Clinton, he says,
characteristically, because he thought he could help: ``I thought I
could make a difference, and maybe THE difference.''
</P>
<P>
   And he makes it clear that he believed his mother, and feels
superior to Clinton in certain ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy's done a great job, by and large, and has strengths I
don't,'' he said in the car the other day. ``But then, I have
strengths he doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he added a line to his stump speech. ``I won't let you
down.'' The subtext being, of course: Unlike some presidents I
could name.
</P>
<P>
   But the phrase also reflects an important truth about Gore, who
was made responsible for his parents' hopes from an early age. He
was raised not to let his family down, and often talks about his
work and his life in a way that suggests he defines himself as
someone people are depending on.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to be a good night watchman,'' said a Gore
relative. ``That's the kind of president he would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet because of his ambivalence about politics, in some past
races he has seemed focused only in the final stages of the
campaign, on deadline, like the former news reporter he is. There
is typically a last-minute flurry of ``new Al Gore'' stories,
detailing his metamorphosis from lackluster to ``newly energized''
campaigner. And aides certainly hope they see that beginning now,
as he bonds with his running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   On Long Island the other day, Gore said his own theory about the
many stories that begin, ``In yet another attempt to reinvent
himself today ...'' is that reporters sense that he is discarding
the vice presidential voice they have heard him speaking in for
nearly eight years and hear his newly presidential voice ``as
trying to be something they don't think I am.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel a dissonance that shows up in their interpretation
of what I say, how I look, my mannerisms. What they see is very
different from what they're certain I am. I'm not being dishonest,
though, and neither are they.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't stay that way, though,'' he predicted. ``Whether
people who go through it admit it or not, it's a growth
experience,'' he said, referring to the wild ride of a presidential
run. ``It's a transformative process.''

DOCTORS AGAIN DIAGNOSE SKIN CANCER ON MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who made
an unsuccessful run for the presidency, has been diagnosed with
malignant melanoma, a potentially severe form of skin cancer, on
his temple and arm, his aides said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who was successfully treated for malignant melanoma in
1993 when doctors removed a mole from his shoulder, was scheduled
to undergo more tests on Thursday and Friday at the Mayo Clinic in
Scottsdale, Ariz., and did not yet know the seriousness of his
condition.
</P>
<P>
   After the tests are complete, McCain will discuss the best
treatment options, which can range from minor surgery, if the
cancer is caught early, to chemotherapy, in the later stages.
Malignant melanoma is the most deadly form of skin cancer and the
least common, but if it is caught early it can be highly curable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spots were confirmed to be melanomas after an Aug. 4
biopsy performed at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda,
Md.,'' according to a statement from McCain's office.
</P>
<P>
   Since his 1993 brush with cancer, McCain had been closely
monitored by doctors, who periodically removed suspicious moles or
lesions from his skin. Most of these lesions consisted of basal
cell carcinoma, the least worrisome and most common type of skin
cancer. Doctors had declared him cured last year, since the
malignant melanoma had not recurred for five years.
</P>
<P>
   The type of cancer McCain suffers from is sometimes associated
with prolonged exposure to the sun. The senator was a prisoner of
war for more than five years when his Navy jet was shot down over
North Vietnam, and during his captivity he was often exposed to the
sun.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had told few people about the latest diagnosis and
planned to go public with the information after he learned more
from doctors this week, but he did tell Gov. George W. Bush, who
defeated him for the Republican presidential nomination, last week
when Bush stopped by McCain's Arizona ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``During a routine examination two unrelated spots were
discovered on Sen. John McCain. One is on his left temple, the
other on his left arm,'' said the statement released by his office.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will turn 64 on Aug. 29.

CRUISE SHIP TOURISM REVITALIZES NEWFOUNDLAND AND OTHER ATLANTIC
PROVINCES

<P>
   ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland _ In the workaday harbor here, normally
plied by tugs, tankers and freighters laid up for repairs, Le
Levant offered a startling contrast on a recent day: a sleek French
cruise ship disgorging 50 affluent American tourists.
</P>
<P>
   To welcome the first visitors of Newfoundland's late-summer
cruise season, two young women in redcoat colonial uniforms played
flutes on the quay, and Sailor, a huge Newfoundland dog, wagged his
tail enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   Here on Canada's easternmost island, the scheduled arrival of 15
tourist ships this season is part of a larger psychological and
economic turnaround for a province often compared with Ireland, the
ancestral home of many of its 540,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Newfoundland has been Canada's poorest province, a
steady exporter of brain and brawn and a heavy importer of
financial aid from Ottawa. But echoing Ireland's recent experience,
Newfoundland recorded Canada's highest growth rate last year, 5.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Oil revenues are eating away at Newfoundland's need for federal
aid; a thriving crab and lobster fishing industry is replacing the
500-year experience with cod; and Newfoundland, with its coves and
quiet, is becoming a magnet for tourists. After stagnating for a
decade, tourism jumped by 50 percent over the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s were the boom years for cruise ships in the Pacific
waters of British Columbia and Alaska. In the new decade, Americans
are discovering Atlantic Canada, from Nova Scotia to Newfoundland
to Labrador, and north into the eastern Arctic.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, 150,000 people, almost all Americans, are expected
to take cruises into Canada's eastern provinces, a sevenfold
increase since 1995. Halifax, Nova Scotia, the region's most
popular port of call, has reservations this season for 102 ships,
double the number in 1998. In Montreal, the number of passengers
disembarking at docks of the Old Port neighborhood is expected to
hit 38,000 this summer, double last year's level. Most of the
Atlantic Canada cruises start in Boston and New York.
</P>
<P>
   On Canada's Pacific Coast, British Columbia expects three times
as many cruise passengers as in Atlantic Canada. But if present
trends continue, by the end of this decade cruise traffic on the
two coasts will be roughly even, with 1 million cruise ship
passengers each summer turning Canadian waters into the Caribbean
of the north.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, to capture future waves of retiring baby boomers,
cruise ship companies anticipate growth and have ordered 60 new
ships, worth $24 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means the cruise industry is going to be looking for new
destinations,'' said Gordon Slade, chief executive of the
Cruiseship Authority of Newfoundland and Labrador, a new
public-private entity here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our niche is really the adventure cruising,'' he said. ``We
offer what Alaska offers _ whales, seabirds and fjords. But we also
have what Alaska doesn't have _ the moving ice, icebergs.''
</P>
<P>
   Slade was down at the quay here to greet the French ship, which
had steamed from St. Pierre and Miquelon, two French islands off
the southwest coast of Newfoundland.
</P>
<P>
   Jan E. Robinson, a 45-year-old federal employee from Los
Angeles, greeted Sailor, the dog, and set off for sightseeing on
Water Street, which the city claims to be the oldest street in
North America. On her return, she pronounced St. John's, which
dates back to the mid-1500s, ``a beautiful city _ if I could figure
out how to come back, I would do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Burgess, a 68-year-old retired manufacturer from
Massachusetts who was traveling with his wife, Nancy, was blunt
about why they were here. After 12 cruises, he said, ``we're
running out of places to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 1.1 million American tourists visited Atlantic
Canada, a record number that undoubtedly was lifted higher by the
lure of the weak Canadian dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans are pretty free with their money,'' said Ernest
Gosse, a taxi driver who makes a point of circling by Harbour
Avenue when a cruise ship is in port. ``Last summer, I had one lady
who bought a little dory boat, a couple of sweaters for her
grandkids and two replicas of Viking ships.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurring North American interest in the Rock, as Newfoundlanders
affectionately call their island, are a number of recent novels,
most notably ``The Shipping News'' (Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster), a
novel by E. Annie Proulx that won a Pulitzer Prize in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newfoundland is not well known _ this puts us out there,''
Slade, the cruise ship promoter, said of the book. ``More people
read it outside the province than inside the province. First person
I talked to who had read the book was from Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   For the cruise industry really to take off, St. John's, a
metropolitan area of 150,000 people, needs a way for people to fly
from Europe and the United States and then to take the cruise ships
one way.
</P>
<P>
   Canadians have been demanding an end to laws that restrict
flights between Canadian cities to Canadian airlines. An end to
such restrictions would clear the way for international flights to
stop here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada should consider real airline competition,'' said Brian
Tobin, premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, in an interview. ``We
are not prepared to be quaint little Newfoundland, shrouded in the
mists of time, so Air Canada can be a monopoly for the next 50
years.''

U.S., FEARING SWINE FEVER IN BRITAIN, BANS IMPORTS
</HEADLINE>
  By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The United States ordered a temporary ban on swine
imports from Britain on Wednesday, joining several European
countries that acted after the discovery of swine fever in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The episode has evoked memories of Britain's battle with mad cow
disease, and rattled Britain's livestock traders once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are at their wits' end,'' said James Black, vice
chairman of the National Pig Association, an industry group whose
mood had just begun to recover after a two-year slump in prices.
</P>
<P>
   Swine fever is highly contagious, but is not considered a threat
to humans.
</P>
<P>
   The bans on British shipments of live pigs, pig semen and other
products follow the discovery of swine fever on farms in the East
Anglia region of southeast England. The outbreak is the first in 14
years.
</P>
<P>
   Swine fever is usually controlled only by the destruction of
infected animals. Thousands of animals have already been
slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike mad cow disease _ bovine spongiform encephalopathy _
swine fever is not thought to threaten humans. Mad cow disease has
been linked in Britain to a similar ailment in humans,
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, that has claimed around 50 victims in
this country and caused huge economic losses in British
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Hallie Pickhardt, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Agriculture
Department, said the department had ``placed a hold'' on all swine
imports from Britain. She said that U.S. officials were working
closely with their British counterparts to assess the extent of the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the United States imported just $11 million worth of
British pork products, a tiny amount of its total pork imports.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the European Union, of which Britain is a member,
banned the importation of live pigs and porcine semen from England
to prevent swine fever from spreading to European herds, some of
which were decimated by outbreaks of the disease in the Netherlands
and Germany between 1997 and 1998. Like the United States, Spain
went further and outlawed imports of pig meat.
</P>
<P>
   British officials are trying to persuade European officials in
Brussels to limit the ban to live pigs from the East Anglia region.
</P>
<P>
   For many Britons, the ban has recalled the three-year duel
between Britain and the European Union over exports of British
beef, which was imposed in 1996 and finally lifted one year ago,
except in France. The beef ban stirred deep resentments among those
Britons opposed to what they saw as a meddlesome and hostile
European bureaucracy in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   The pig ban threatened to widen Thursday. A big supermarket
chain, ASDA, which is owned by Wal-Mart Stores Inc., has threatened
to take Belgian pate off its shelves in response to the European
action. An ASDA spokeswoman called the threat ''a symbolic
gesture.''

GORE MUST PUT MEMORABLE WORDS ON CROWNING MOMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He's serious-minded. He's intelligent. He's
well-prepared. But for the challenge that Al Gore faces here, none
of that may matter.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night he claims a presidential nomination he has
yearned to capture for years. It would be a moment of high emotion
for any political figure, but is especially stirring for Gore. This
is the prize that has mesmerized, teased, and eluded, two
generations of men named Albert Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And so now Gore, a careful student of politics and an erudite
connoisseur of the political moment, knows the Democratic
presidential nomination requires a difficult bargain. Now that it
is being given to him, he must do what seems more difficult for him
than for most nominees: give himself entirely to it.
</P>
<P>
   In the American political tradition, that means delivering a
convention acceptance speech that is, alternatively, rousing,
poignant, inspiring _ and insightful. But the insights that
successful nominees bring to their acceptance speeches are
transmitted quietly, subtly _ and, above all, personally.
Successful convention speeches aren't full of the candidate's
insights. Successful convention speeches prompt listeners to gain
insights about the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   That is Gore's challenge, and his difficulty. He has been part
of the political wallpaper for eight years. He is, like the
Hollywood billboards here advertising a new fall-season film,
``Almost Famous''; the public thinks there is nothing new to learn
about him. And the unusual nature of his opponent, Governor George
W. Bush _ whose very appeal comes from his likeability and his
ability to skim blithely above the surface of things _ makes this
task all the more arduous. To draw a distinction between himself
and the GOP nominee, Gore almost always succumbs to the temptation
to show his command of the material, his mastery of detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presidency is not an academic exercise,'' Gore told former
Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey during the winter primaries. The
line, which was crafted by Gore's daughter, was a devastating
critique of Gore's Democratic rival. But its lesson hasn't been
fully learned by Gore himself.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Democratic Convention here has had a vaguely
academic whiff to it, more like a seminar than a revival meeting.
For three days, the podium has been full of a parade of earnest
speakers, full of just the sort of specificity that was absent two
weeks ago in Philadelphia. The speeches about health care have been
full of statistics. The talks about Social Security have been full
of projections. There have even been panels of citizens and public
officials holding dialogues about issues.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the message rumbling out of Los Angeles so far has
been a blur _ lots of small type, no big headline. Wittingly or
unwittingly, the convention is a remarkable reflection of the
candidate the party is putting forward in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Now the convention reaches a new, critical stage, requiring Gore
to alter substantially the entire tone and focus of the proceedings
_ and of the public's view of himself.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has spent the last five months reaching for America's mind.
Thursday night he must touch its heart. He is perhaps the leading
debater in American public life today. Thursday night that skill is
of little use. An acceptance speech is not a debate. It is won more
often with poignancy than on points.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``New Frontier,'' outlined in an outdoor acceptance
speech here 40 years ago, helped propel John F. Kennedy to the
White House. When Bill Clinton, born in the tiny community of Hope,
Ark., told the 1992 Democratic convention in New York that he still
believed ``in a place called Hope,'' he stirred the nation _ and
the glow from that moment remained with the Clinton and Gore team
as they rode the backroads of America in their famous bus trips.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's task is much like President George H.W. Bush's in 1988.
Like Gore, Bush was vice president to a two-term president. Like
Gore, Bush was regarded as a pale imitation of the president. Like
Gore, Bush was familiar _ but largely unknown. And so he told the
New Orleans convention: ``Now you must see me for what I am: the
Republican candidate for president....And now I turn to the
American people to share my hopes and intentions, and why and where
I wish to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   All week a sense of anticipation has filled the Staples Center,
where delegates have exchanged pleasantries and political gossip.
The delegates expected a strong valedictory from the president and
they got it. They expected a series of appearances from party
luminaries and they got them. They expected an uplifting address
Wednesday night from Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut,
the Democrats' vice presidential candidate, and they got that, too.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't quite sure what to expect from Gore, but they know
what they need from him.
</P>
<P>
   They know that he is behind in the polls. They know that he has
political skills. They know that he has to speak in a different
idiom, to a different audience, and for a different purpose, than
anything he has ever attempted before. And they know one thing
more: that the outcome of the election may depend in no small
measure on that.

 &HT;    Ohioan goes from teaching to being Cowboys' placekicker
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas - Tim Seder gave up nearly everything in
his personal and professional life to become the Dallas Cowboys'
placekicker.
</P>
<P>
   Seder quit his teaching job in Ohio, indefinitely left his wife,
traveled 1,000 miles to a new city, rented a studio apartment,
found a roommate and kicked a football until the Cowboys were
satisfied they had their man.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Seder was a three-sport coach at Lucas High School in
Mansfield, Ohio. When he returned home from basketball practice one
day in the dead of winter, his life took a dramatic change.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I walked in the house, my wife said I'd better listen to
the answering machine,'' Seder said Wednesday during a break at
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   The call was from Steve Hoffman, kicking coach for the Cowboys.
There was a job opening in Dallas, and Hoffman wanted the
25-year-old teacher to apply. The salary and perks were good ...
but there was a catch.
</P>
<P>
   Seder's chances of making the squad were about 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Seder temporarily kissed his wife Melissa goodbye and followed
his dream of playing in the NFL. Who would have figured that
someone from tiny Ashland University who had not played competitive
football in three years would be offered that type of a deal?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not Seder.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the NFL was concerned, I never thought I'd have a
shot to kick,'' Seder said. ``I thought I was going to be coaching,
and I was striving to become better at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Seder's first tryout for Hoffman was memorable. Seder walked
into Texas Stadium with old soccer shoes that had holes on the
sides. When Hoffman asked him about his style of footwear, Seder
quietly said, ``That's all I got, coach.''
</P>
<P>
   When Seder's first kicked missed badly, Hoffman rolled his eyes,
wondering how he could make such a mistake. Seder responded by
nailing several in a row, all with tremendous height and distance.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman's hunch about Seder was starting to look good.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Cowboys called, Seder had never sniffed an NFL team.
He was not drafted after finishing college three years ago. He was
never a free agent. No team gave him much thought until Hoffman did
some research.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman, the NFL's only full-time kicking coach, was sorting
through a stack of nearly 200 videos when he came across a dark and
grainy tape of Seder kicking a football in a high school gym.
Former Ashland assistant coach Dave Jaumotte, now with the Detroit
Lions, told Hoffman at the 1998 NFL combine in Indianapolis that he
knew of a kicker _ Seder _ with great potential.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman contacted Seder and requested a tape. Seder's kicking
technique was good, Hoffman recalled, but the Cowboys were already
satisfied with their kicker, Richie Cunningham. So Seder's tape was
thrown into a stack with dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman laughs when he talks about the tapes he receives almost
daily. He has tapes of kickers from Arizona State, Washington and
Michigan, not to mention England and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman's favorite came from a man who attempted 50-yard field
goals on a rainy afternoon. The kicker's young sons chased the
footballs. The ball always landed short of the goal post, splashing
in a mud puddle in the end zone. That tape no longer is part of
Hoffman's stack.
</P>
<P>
   Seder's story is important because the Cowboys entered training
camp without an experienced kicker on their roster. After two good
years, Cunningham lost his accuracy _ and his confidence _ midway
through the 1999 season. Veteran Eddie Murray finished the season,
but the Cowboys began to search for a young kicker who would make
the league minimum, $193,000.
</P>
<P>
   Seder performed well at a minicamp in April, earning himself a
spot on the summer roster, and became the No. 1 kicker when the
Cowboys released his only challenger, Rian Lindell, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The deeply religious Seder said he is ``blessed'' to be with the
Cowboys. When he signs autographs after practice, he writes Bible
scriptures about trust and confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Seder credits Hoffman for his early success with the Cowboys.
Among his adjustments, Seder has removed a ``hop-step'' on his
kicking approach to provide better balance.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman and Coach Dave Campo said Seder's ability is matched
only by his confidence. He has made three of four field goals
during preseason games _ his only miss was from 58 yards _ and
earned the job by outkicking Lindell in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the hard part. Nothing really matters until the Sept.
3 openeout those two topics in our society. We love to be
titillated, but we chastise those who titillate us. We have one of
the biggesa dysfunctional family fighting its way to destruction.
Charlene, who writes women's erotica to support her 16-year-old
daughter and 14-year-old son, is both attracted to and repelled by
Clyde, who can't seem to leave her alone despite court papers
orderineir parents. The play also offers two other voices: a woman
whose dialogue represents Charlene's inner thoughts and a man who
represents a variety of characters, including the male part of
Charlene and the fears that Clyde has instilled in her.
</P>
<P>
   May, o all of us by the throat. A lot of people don't want to

domestic violence groups _ Men Stopping Violence and the Women's
Resource Center To End Domestic Violence. Together they hope to
educate theatergoers and, if possible, effect chanto-face with
those who counsel the men and women caught in the cycle of
violence. The ``Hot 'N' Throbbing'' programs will carry phone
numbers where women can get help; tables in the theater loly can
have an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   The power of this play came throuir as May worked with two cast
members on a ``sex scene,'' and fight director Jason Armit worked
with Bryan Mercer (Clyde) and Patricia French (Charlene)
choreographing a struggle _ whose hand goes where, how to reach for
a gun, how to tighten a belt aroun whispering their lines, intent
on perfecting their movements.
</P>
<P>
   French's eyes blinked, radiating a panic that seemed more real
than pretend.
</P>
<P>
   They paused. ``Are you OK?'' Mercer asked. French nodded. ``It
was a good fight,'' he said. Their director drew closer. ``You guys
are awesome,'' she said. ``This is a n ``Hot 'N' Throbbing.'' Red
lights pulse when Charlene is writing her saucy screenplays or a
scene from her imagination is being played out. White lights signal
reality, which will crowd the audience in the close 80-seat space
at PushPush Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Vogel's play is hardly the first to take on a social issue:
Rodgeere is no message,'' says Mercer. ``I don't think performance
is therapy, but I do believe it's an incredible spiritual tool with
which to reach yourself and others.''

   Hulk Hogan sues over televised barbs
</P>
<P>
   By Jim Dyer
</P>
<P>
   c. 2000 Cox News Service s personal, unscripted, and, according
to Hogan, defamatory.
</P>
<P>
   The blond-locked behemoth, considered by many as the ``Babe the
words of Vince Russo, creative director of the World Championship
Wrestling Inc., in Smyrna, ``placed (Hogan) in a false light'' and
damaged his character and image.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't part of the script,'' said Hogan's lawyer, John
Taylor, of Atlanta, who adamantly denied the lawsuit was part of a
publicity stunt This is a real lawsuit,'' he said. ``What (Russo)
said was defamatory and a breach of contract.'' Worse yet, he
added, Hulk's children were in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan's match had been the featured ``main event'' at the July 9
spectacle in Daytona Beach, Fla. Russo changed the order of the
matches, then ordered Hogan's refuse to fight Hogan, the lawsuit
claims.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan, who won by default, left the ring with the title but was
immediately followed by Russo, who began disparaging him to the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``All day long I'm playing politics with Hulk Hogan, because
Hulk Hogan wants to play his creative control card,'' Russo told a
national television audience, according to transcripts of his
speech contained in the lawsuit. Russo, who called Hogan a ``big
bald son of a -----,'' implied Hogan is dishonest, undeserving of
the title belt, and unworthy of respect from wrestling fans, claims
the suit, which seeks unspecified damages. WCW spokesman Alan Sharp
declined comment on the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Russo's commelawsuit, who must explore the fine line between
``scripted'' insults that are entertainment and ``unscripted''
insults that may be defamatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very unique legal issues,'' said Henry Holmes, Hogan's
personal attorney in Beverly Hills, Calif.

KHADAFY IN STRANGE NEW ROLE: NEGOTIATOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ Callie and Monique Strydom, a young couple from
South Africa held hostage for 117 days in the Philippine jungle,
could be on their way Thursday to be dinner guests of Colonel
Moammar Khadafy _ and extras in the Libyan leader's effort to play
a dramatic new role on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   After months of failed military and diplomatic efforts to free
the more than 20 international hostages, Khadafy intervened and
succeeded this week in breaking the negotiating stalemate with
unspecified pledges of aid for the hostage-takers.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the man who has been a fixture on Washington's list of
terrorism sponsors for decades is being hailed in some quarters,
however cautiously, as a statesman. And he seemed ready to bask in
the moment. A Libyan plane stood by to carry the hostages to
Tripoli, which was adorned in international flags as it awaited
them.
</P>
<P>
   Khadafy ordered a feast prepared for the hostages, and hotels in
Tripoli filled up with diplomats and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has always had ideals and ambitions to be a leader of some
significance on the world stage,'' said Jakes Gerwel, an aide to
former South African President Nelson Mandela who knows Khadafy.
``He wants to project himself as a major player.''
</P>
<P>
   The drama began in April, when a radical Muslim group called the
Abu Sayyaf captured 21 hostages on the Malaysian resort island of
Sidapan and fled with them to its stronghold in the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   In the four months since, the Abu Sayyaf captured more than a
dozen more people, including four European journalists and a dozen
Christian evangelists who visited the rebel camp. The group, which
seeks an Islamic state, released seven hostages last month, but
demanded $25 million for the remaining 28.
</P>
<P>
   The government in Manila tried a military response first,
raiding the camp with soldiers and then hitting the rebels with
mortars. When that did not work, European, Lebanese, and South
African diplomats entered the fray, hoping to free their nationals.
Khadafy sent his own envoy in May.
</P>
<P>
   Libya has had a long relationship with Muslim rebel groups in
the Philippines and has helped to build schools and mosques on the
poor southern islands. It was unclear Wednesday just what Tripoli
offered to break the hostage stalemate, and to whom.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the rebels had freed six Malaysians, one ailing German
woman, and three journalists for an estimated $5.5 million from
Lybian sources, according to some military officials. Eyewitness on
Jolo Island said they saw rebels dividing large sums among
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But Former Libyan Ambassador Abdul Rajab Azzarouq, Khadafy's
envoy, denied that Lybia had paid ransom, saying Libya would only
provide funds for development in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   If money went straight to the rebels, said Megan O'Sullivan, an
analyst at the Brookings Institution in Washington, Libya has
broken the first rule of counter-terrorism: no concessions. She
noted, however, that Libya has been ``using its oil money to shore
up its image'' for years.
</P>
<P>
   Libya began to emerge from its deep isolation roughly a year
ago, when Mandela persuaded Khadafy to hand over two suspects in
the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations had imposed sanctions on Lybia since 1992 in
an effort to get it to turn over the two men for trial. The
sanctions have since been lifted, and most of the world has rushed
to restore economic and other ties with Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Tripoli has made several other gestures to restore its image.
Last year, it compensated the family of a British police officer
killed in 1984 by gunfire from the Libyan embassy in London, and it
gave France $31 million for the families of those killed in the
1989 bombing of an airplane over Niger.
</P>
<P>
   Khadafy also renounced terrorism last year. The United States
has not connected Libya with an act of terrorism for at least five
years.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States also remains skeptical about the
intentions of Khadafy, who maintains ties that make Washington
uneasy, and has refused to lift its unilateral sanctions against
Lybia.
</P>
<P>
   In recent Senate hearings, Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas
argued that, ``Khadafy is the same dictator he ever was.'' Senator
Robert Torricelli echoed that attitude, remarking that ``the belief
that the US is ever going to witness the reformation of the
polices, the personalities of the governments of North Korea, Cuba,
Libya, or Iraq is a triumph of hope over reality.''
</P>
<P>
   John Stremlau, a visiting professor of international relations
at the University of the Witswatersrand in Johannesburg, said such
thinking may need to be reconsidered. Khadafy seems to have matured
during his isolation, he said, and softened his tone. And if some
of his ideas lean toward the grandiose _ Khadafy advocates a United
States of Africa, for example _ it seems clear that he hopes to
lend his hand to solving conflicts. Hardly a week goes by, Gerwel
said, that Lybia isn't hosting talks on regional issues like the
war in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Libya's involvement in the hostage crisis ``marks a profound
change,'' Stremlau said. ``Maybe we need to think differently about
these rogue leaders. If Khadafy can play a constructive role, why
not let him?''

<P>
   After Al Gore ran for president in 1988 and lost, just as he
turned 40, he organized a series of dinners where he went around
the room and asked each person to tell him where he had gone wrong.
What hadn't he known? What hadn't he done?
</P>
<P>
   It was excruciating, his friends said, but he insisted on
hearing the bad news _ in detail _ about a campaign that had begun
as an environmental crusade and ended as a New York food fight. He
heard that he had no economic vision and that he had talked about
technology and the environment in ways that people could not
understand. Oh, and his speaking style needed a ton of work.
</P>
<P>
   Gore responded, as he always has, by going back to school. He
put together a graduate seminar for one, complete with a syllabus
and a heavy-duty reading list, and applied himself to the serious
study of tax policy and business history. He brought in a
mathematician to explain chaos theory. And he hired a speech
consultant and a dance coach _ ``a ballet type,'' he told one
friend _ to help him move more fluidly.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians often learn from and are even transformed by a
drubbing at the polls, but few have pursued their lessons as
aggressively as Gore. The man who will accept the Democratic
Party's presidential nomination Thursday night has diligently
readied himself.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all this extensive preparation has not showed in the Gore
campaign, which at least until recently has seemed surprisingly
unfocused. While Gore been training to govern from quite a young
age, he has always had mixed feelings about the path to power that
is politics.
</P>
<P>
   He is a student by nature _ even after Vietnam, he treated his
moral hangover with a year of divinity school, saying he wanted to
impose some structure on the exercise. His extraordinary
willingness to learn and change has taught him much, but it has
also exposed him to the charge that he is constantly reinventing
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Reinvention isn't all bad. In 1981, when Gore was concerned
about the Cold War, he turned himself into an arms-control expert
in a single year by plunging into the arcana of a subject he had
previously known almost nothing about. In the '90s, he got way out
front in learning about issues that no one else was paying much
mind, like information technology and global warming.
</P>
<P>
   ``His education is ongoing,'' said his Harvard friend Tommy Lee
Jones, the actor. ``Where 20 years ago he would have made outlines
with Roman numerals, now it would look like rectangles on top of
each other, equally well-organized but not so linear, and probably
three-dimensional.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet this quality has caused trouble for Gore in the current
campaign, mostly noted through small but symbolic personal
alterations, like his new Palm Pilot and his switch from dark suits
to earth tones _ changes that are insignificant in themselves, but
resonate because they remind many people of the way he has shifted
on some key issues, particularly gun control and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   It is the same story with his work ethic. As a senator, Gore was
so determined to shoehorn extra work into his day that during
weekends of back-to-back town hall meetings he would get himself
booked in two places at the same time _ a trick that was possible,
barely, because Tennessee straddles two time zones.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is someone who makes all his hard work look like ... hard
work. Lacking the smooth moves of either his boss, Bill Clinton, or
his Republican opponent, George W. Bush, Gore is a plodder, who
hopes to be a tortoise to Bush's hare.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more going on than raw effort. Gore's intellect and
the willingness to use it are probably his most important assets.
His oldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, said: ``He likes to ask,
`What's the assumption here? What if we subvert it?' and one of the
things he could maybe do well if he wins the job is make new
connections, like between the economy and the environment, and ask,
`What if we were the leading exporter of ways to clean up the
environment?'''
</P>
<P>
   Those are not the kind of connections that crowds thrill to,
though. All Gore's smarts do not necessarily translate into an
ability to sway the public with feeling, as well as facts _ as he
is all too aware.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is genuinely in love with the world of ideas, loves nothing
more than a good kibbitz about the multiverse, and apparently sees
how fractal geometry might improve our lives.
</P>
<P>
   He is a sucker for fun facts, too _ and always alert for
openings to share them. During his campaign visits to schools, he
has delivered spontaneous lectures on the Ice Ages, the Industrial
Revolution and the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   At 52, Albert Arnold Gore is without question a complicated man.
He is a native of Washington, where he met the men who ran the
world through his father, Sen. Albert Gore, an up-from-nothing
child of the Depression whose stands for civil rights and against
the Vietnam War were out-of-sync with his Tennessee constituents
and cost him his seat in 1970. Yet young Al Gore had something of a
double life even in the capital, where he attended elite schools
yet dressed in a cousin's hand-me-downs and lived in a four-room
hotel suite because it was owned by a relative who gave his family
a break on the rent.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a real Tennesseean, who spent summers there, working
hard on the family farm, and while there made his closest friends,
many of whom remain in his life today.
</P>
<P>
   He is someone who prays over meals and quotes the Bible. But he
is also devoted to science, and spends the time he's in the
helicopter en route to Air Force Two reading magazines like Nature,
Science and Discover.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his most deeply felt positions _ in support of both free
trade and the labor unions, for example _ create political
contradictions. And sometimes, he seems to be fighting himself as
much as he is Bush.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He is on the one hand an incredibly careful man, yet at least at
times has been unusually willing to make himself vulnerable, as he
did in writing ``Earth in the Balance,'' a deeply confessional
environmental manifesto in which he ties man's mistreatment of the
environment to a lack of deep connection in dysfunctional families.
</P>
<P>
   One knock against Gore is that he has not shown himself to be
sufficiently human. But it may be that he has shown himself to be
all too human, someone who does sweat the small stuff and is cursed
with a level of self-awareness that does not appear to trouble
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Even amid the campaign, Gore is a highly interior person, who
can withdraw deep inside himself quite suddenly. He loved the wild,
dark, out-there movie ``Being John Malkovich.'' (Bush had said that
the last movie he enjoyed in a theater was ``Forrest Gump.'')
</P>
<P>
   Gore does not suffer from a lack of confidence; he is a man who
applied only to Harvard because it never occurred to him that he
wouldn't get in. When he became a newspaper reporter, he seems to
have assumed he would follow in the footsteps of David Halberstam,
a friend of his sister's, who had won a Pulitzer Prize. He ran for
Congress at 28 and began mounting his first presidential campaign
only 10 years later. If elected, he would have been the youngest
president in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore was not ready in 1988, and he ended up an observer in
his own campaign, watching his surrogate, New York City Mayor Ed
Koch, fight the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Gore's one friend among other
Democrats in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statements made by Mayor Koch took me by surprise,'' Gore
said in a recent interview. ``I had no advance notice, was not
happy about it and didn't handle it very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gore himself had snidely knocked Jackson, saying the country
was electing a president, not a preacher. Then he was overwhelmed
with guilt, horrified in particular by the racial implications of
the Koch-Jackson feud, that he should have been aware of when he
sought an alliance with Koch. In the campaign's final days, Gore he
was asking Jackson's forgiveness on an almost daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had been a virtual grown-up since he was a kid, expected to
perform in the company of important adults. He had seen the
nation's leaders up close, and had not been daunted.
</P>
<P>
   In his first Senate term, which began in 1985, he was already
bored. And he simply could not wait to lead, he said, to take the
country where he felt it ought to go.
</P>
<P>
   His father was pushing him, even playing on his emotions by
saying he wanted to see his boy elected president before he died.
But aides say he was at least as influenced by the simple
availability of cash from the party's money men, once it became
clear that neither Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York nor Sen. Dale
Bumpers of Arkansas would make the race in 1988. And Gore's head
was turned by the media _ Washington reporters who in those days
could not get enough of him.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite two years after he was elected to the Senate, the talk
show host John McLaughlin said to Gore during a television
interview:
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got the magical name _ Al Gore. Your father was in
Congress for 32 years. You've got character, you've got no clay
feet, no skeletons showing. You're intelligent. You're
well-informed. You've got a Vietnam War record. You've been an
investigative reporter, and you've got religious coloration, too.
For one year you were a divinity student, and you're a devout
Baptist. You're almost too good to be true. Are you too good to be
true?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's answer: ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's impeachment and Gore's own role in the fund-raising
scandals of recent years took care of that perception, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy's done a great job, by and large, and has strengths I
don't,'' Gore said of Clinton in a recent interview. ``But then, I
have strengths he doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Gore added a line to his stump speech. ``I won't let
you down.'' The subtext being, of course: Unlike some presidents I
could name.
</P>
<P>
   But the phrase also reflects an important truth about Gore, who
was made responsible for his parents' hopes from an early age. He
was raised not to let his family down, and often talks about his
work and his life in a way that suggests he defines himself as
someone people are depending on.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to be a good night watchman,'' said a Gore
relative. ``That's the kind of president he would be.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Mike Taylor, a US House candidate from North
Carolina, recently opened a fancy letter inviting him to dinner at
Spago's, one of the most sought-after restaurants during the
Democratic National Convention. But Taylor's wife was not
impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `Honey, you need to be down campaigning with the
good people of Frog Pond,' '' Taylor recalled. So he is skipping
this week's convention in favor of campaigning at home, and he is
not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials said most of their top House prospects have
decided to bypass Los Angeles. The reasons vary, but some Democrats
clearly find it beneficial to keep their distance from the glitz
and glamour of Hollywood _ and in some cases from President Clinton
and Vice President Al Gore as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has partly to do with my own disappointment,'' said Linda
Chapin, a top House candidate from Florida, referring to Clinton's
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. ``This could
have been the most triumphant moment for the Democratic Party in
100 years and instead it is marred, and many of us who had such
hopes can't help but be disappointed by that.''
</P>
<P>
   Chapin, like other Democratic House candidates interviewed for
this story, stressed she fully supports Gore and Senator Joseph
Lieberman as the presidential and vice presidential candidates.
Clinton, however, is another matter, especially in some moderate
and conservative-leaning districts.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore has had trouble separating himself from Clinton in
the public's mind, candidates such as Chapin find it to their
advantage to present themselves as independent. Chapin, for
example, finds it more important to appeal to Republicans and
Democrats at home than to spend the week at the convention. She
said she would not invite Clinton to campaign for her in Orlando,
although she would welcome Gore and Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   While many House candidates are absent here, their races are at
the top of the party's agenda. The Democrats need to pick up six
seats to regain control of the House. Democrats also hope to take
back the Senate, but the prospects there are considered more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Cook of the Cook Political Report, which tracks
congressional races, said this will be one of the tightest
elections for control of the House that he can remember. The main
reason is so few seats are really in play.
</P>
<P>
   All 435 House seats are up in November, but that includes 401
members running for reelection, and at least 97 percent of the
incumbents are expected to win, Cook said. There are 34 ``open''
seats in which an incumbent has retired, lost a primary or is
running for higher office. Thus, out of the 435 races, about 20 are
``hotly contested'' and another 20 are ``competitive,'' according
to Cook. In most years, there are three times as many competitive
races, but the strong economy has led to a general satisfaction
with incumbents this year, he said. Cook recently rated the odds of
a Democratic takeover of the House as a too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   With so few House races in play, the two major political parties
have pumped extraordinary resources into a handful of races, and
the candidates have weighed every move carefully. The National
Republican Congressional Committee has raised more than $92
million, while the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has
raised $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, for all the hoopla surrounding the this week's convention
_ the 4,368 delegates, the 15,000 members of the media, the
seemingly endless round of parties _ the event is not necessarily a
plus for Democrats in tight races.
</P>
<P>
   Even Mike Ross of Arkansas, another top Democratic prospect,
said it wasn't worthwhile going to Los Angeles, even though he
could have highlighted his ties to Clinton. Ross, like the
president, comes from ``a place called Hope,'' _ Hope, Ark. But
Ross, speaking by cellular phone while driving across the sprawling
district he hopes to represent, said he didn't have time to come to
the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got 84 days to meet 600,000 people in 26 counties,'' Ross
said. ``The voters are here, not in L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Representative Patrick J. Kennedy of Rhode Island,
chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said
House candidates must run with the Gore-Lieberman agenda in order
to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no separating yourself from the nominee and the
message of our standard-bearer,'' Kennedy said. ``Al Gore is the
messenger for the Democratic Party now. There is no way around it,
we are all in it together.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Kennedy said, candidates have good reason to come
here. ``You have donors from all over the country, and it is a
great opportunity to network.'' He noted that Pennsylvania
candidate Patrick Casey is addressing the convention. But there is
some irony in that. Casey's father, the late Pennsylvania Governor
Bob Casey, was famously denied a chance to address the 1992
convention because he opposed abortion. Thursday night, Patrick
Casey is scheduled to appear before the convention to introduce a
video tribute to his father.
</P>
<P>
   As for House candidates who prefer to stay away, Kennedy said he
respects their decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know their districts best,'' Kennedy said. ``I find
myself supporting people who are diametrically opposed to me on the
issues, and I still support them because they will be the vote for
... the new majority.''
</P>
<P>
   For candidates such as Taylor in North Carolina, there's no
place like home. So instead of enjoying the cuisine of Wolfgang
Puck at Spago's and networking with donors, Taylor is dining at
Witley's Luncheonette in Ablemare, N.C., and campaigning in towns
such as Big Lick and Frog Pond instead of hobnobbing in Beverly
Hills.
</P>
<P>
   As for the convention, Taylor said: ``I don't pick up that
people are watching.''

 &HT;    A&AMP;M defensive end out for the seasonBy Randy Riggs
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Defensive end, not a deep position for Texas A&AMP;M
anyway, became even more shallow Wednesday with the announcement
that starting left end Rocky Bernard will be lost for the season
with a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard, a senior whose 22 career starts rank fourth among Aggie
defensive veterans, was injured in a noncontact drill in practice
Tuesday. A&AMP;M officials said he will have surgery within a week to
10 days. Bernard has another year of eligibility remaining because
he has never redshirted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed,'' said Bernard, a 275-pounder from
Baytown Sterling who had four sacks last year. ``I was looking
forward to my senior year, but I will bounce back. I've learned
it's not the bad things that happen to you, but how you respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Junior Evan Perroni, who pressed Bernard for the starting job in
the spring, will move up. But A&AMP;M's depth at defensive end was
shaky even before Bernard's injury.
</P>
<P>
   It began in the spring when Lonnie Madison was moved from
defensive end to tight end because of concerns over projected
starter Michael de la Torre's recovery from a back injury. Then in
late May, defensive end Terry Nichols was killed in an automobile
accident in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Highly regarded sophomore Ty Warren is the only experienced
backup, but he remains penciled in behind Ronald Flemons at right
end. A&AMP;M also has two true freshmen defensive linemen _ Marcus
Jasmin of New Orleans and Linnis Smith of Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to adjust and move forward because this really
hurts our depth,'' Coach R.C. Slocum said. ``This is a big
disappointment for us. Rocky had worked hard this summer and we
were counting on him being one of our leaders.''

 &HT;    GORE READY WITH DETAIL-FILLED SPEECH
 &HT;    By KEN FOSKETT
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vice President Gore claims the spotlight for his
own Thursday night and delivers a speech accepting the Democratic
nomination for president that he promises will be part biography,
part vision and long on detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they deserve specifics,'' Gore said aboard Air Force
Two en route to Los Angeles Wednesday. ``I think they deserve a
clear discussion of what the alternatives are and what we need to
do to move our country in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Three months in the making, Gore's speech will conclude the
convention and launch Gore into the fall campaign against Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas. The speech also marks the culmination of a
quest that Gore first began in 1988 when he ran and lost the
Democratic nomination for president.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly eight years as the junior partner to a popular
president, Thursday night's speech will be Gore's opportunity to
emerge from under Clinton's wing and claim the prize he has sought
for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to it,'' Gore declared. ``This is a speech
that I have written, and I will deserve the credit or the blame.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore arrived in Los Angeles Wednesday after 10 days of
campaigning in key swing states. Standing in an airport hanger in
Burbank with his wife, Tipper, and running mate, Sen. Joe
Lieberman, D-Conn., Gore pumped his fists in the air and said he
was ``looking forward to addressing the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he and Lieberman spoke before delegates from their home
states of Tennessee and Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   With Gore trailing Bush in most polls, there is considerable
pressure on Gore to deliver a strong address that galvanizes
Democrats and attracts undecided voters to his ticket.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore felt any of the pressure himself, he did not show it
Wednesday. Gore said he he had more ``butterflies'' about the
speeches that daughters Karenna and Kristin were scheduled to
deliver Wednesday than his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very relaxed about it,'' said Gore. ``I'm not
nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore will attempt to use his moment in the national spotlight to
show voters how his life experiences have shaped his commitment to
public service, senior Gore aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will also make a pledge to hold regular town hall meetings
both before the November elections and if he ascends to the White
House as a way to ``engage people in the spirit of democracy,''
said Chris Lehane, Gore's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   While calling the speech positive in tone, aides said Gore will
seek to contrast his proposals for Social Security and middle-class
tax cuts with those of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people will get out of it is a clear idea of where he is
going to take the country,'' Lehane said. ``For the most part, this
is a very future-oriented speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Gerston, a political scientist at San Jose State
University, said Gore must excite more Democrats over his candidacy
and reach out to moderate and swing voters who haven't yet made up
their minds about Gore or Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to solidify the base of Democratic voters, to show
Democrats why he is just as good as Clinton,'' Gerston said.
Without trying to emulate Clinton, Gore has to at least convince
voters that he share's Clinton's compassion and sympathy for
people, Gerston said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing Al Gore could do is try to be Bill Clinton,''
he said. ``Because nobody can be as good.''
</P>
<P>
   Convention delegates, who Gore is relying on to provide energy
for the fall campaign, said they were anxious for Gore to step on
to the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest hope is that he will come across as the charismatic
person he is rather than what he is seen as today,'' said Kim
Caridas, a union representative from Ohio. ``I think that would
help more than (addressing) the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he began conceptualizing his speech three months ago,
using easels and poster board to outline the themes he wanted to
address. Gore did not actually begin writing his speech until two
weeks ago, when he vacationed in North Carolina during the
Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first draft was written, Gore continued to focus the
message and winnow the speech's length to fit approximately
one-hour time slot he has Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gore relied on a handful of aides for input: message-maker
Carter Eskew, strategist Bob Shrum and speechwriter Eli Attie.
Gore's wife, Tipper, eldest daughter Karenna and brother-in-law,
Frank Hunger, also chipped in.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane said he was unaware of any input from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fundamentally a speech by him,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   The speech will reflect the thinking by Gore and his senior
advisers that Bush's acceptance speech to Republicans in
Philadelphia lacked specifics, and he plans to include more detail
in his own speech to delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been rehearsing his speech off and on oveton and
contrast him to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scepter is in his hand really looking forward to it,''
Eskew said. ``This is really an opportunity for him now to be the
main guy and to stand on that s e-mail address is

GORE'S ACCEPTANCE SPEECH WILL BE SELF-WRITTEN SELF-PORTRAIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As Al Gore tinkers with the final version of his
address to the nation, his speech has come together in what he and
his aides describe as a political self-portrait, heavy on personal
biography, policy detail and a vision for the future, all crafted
in his own hand and in his precise syntax.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a speech I have written; I will deserve the credit or
the blame,'' he told reporters on Air Force II as he traveled
Wednesday morning from Michigan to accept his party's nomination at
the Democratic National Convention here.
</P>
<P>
   His aides emphasized that more than anything, Gore hoped to
seize the moment and present himself as the leader of his party.
This has been the plan all along, now that President Clinton has
exited the convention and the two staged a symbolic ``passing the
torch'' ceremony in Michigan on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is his main chance to be the main guy,'' said Carter
Eskew, Gore's top media adviser. ``That's something he's been
looking forward to for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Chris Lehane, Gore's spokesman: ``The scepter is in his
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore suggested that he wanted to present a kind of unifying
vision of himself, connecting his policies with his life
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that those who watch and listen will feel afterward
that they have a clearer idea of exactly what I'm proposing to
do,'' Gore told reporters. ``They'll also know how the ideas and
proposals I'm making are rooted in the experiences that I've had.
I'll give a few specific examples. I'll tell them why I feel as
strongly as I do about the choices we have to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly buoyant, Gore held two rallies here Wednesday before
watching his oldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, 27, place his
name in nomination, the first time a daughter has nominated her
father.
</P>
<P>
   All day, as he talked with reporters on his plane and at the
rallies _ and in the last few days on the campaign trail _ Gore has
been previewing his speech, saying it would be heavy on policy
details.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that you deserve to know exactly what the candidates
are proposing to do so you can make an informed judgment,'' he said
to cheers at a rally in a hangar at the Burbank airport, with Air
Force II parked in the background. ``I'm going to tell you!''
</P>
<P>
   At a second rally on the lot of Warner Brothers studios, he
presented his decision to discuss specifics as a political
``risk,'' saying: ``Tomorrow night when I address the convention,
I'm going to take the risk of laying out some specifics.'' Aides
said this was a deliberate counterpoint to criticism that Gore
comes across as too cautious and calculating.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than any of that, I believe it's time for all of us to
come together and lift up the ideal of the best America that we can
move toward,'' he said in Burbank, in a faint echo of John F.
Kennedy's speech when he accepted the Democratic presidential
nomination 40 years ago in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every generation we have to make the hard choices between
one direction or another, between going back to the past or forward
to the future,'' Gore said. ``Let others argue the case for the old
guard. We're the new guard, and we're going to bring positive
change to the United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Eskew said that Gore's speech describes differences with Gov.
George W. Bush, his Republican rival, but that it remains
``respectful.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gore said he began working on the speech two months ago,
rewriting it with the advice of Eskew and Bob Shrum, his top
message and media advisers, and Eli Attie, his speechwriter. In
what may be a first for a presidential nomination speech, Gore has
been tapping the speech out on a laptop computer and the aides have
been exchanging copies of it by computer disc. (Clinton, by
contrast, prefers to write longhand.)
</P>
<P>
   ``He goes through a process where he gets a draft and looks at
it and signs off on certain sections and zeroes in on things he
wants to refine and tweak,'' Eskew said.
</P>
<P>
   A motorcade took Gore and his running mate, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, and their wives, Tipper and Hadassah, from the Burbank
airport to the Warner Bros. studios, where they were greeted by
delegations from Tennessee and Connecticut, ``home folks,'' as Gore
called them.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman noted that the television program, ``West Wing,'' was
produced on this lot and said of Bush: ``The closest George Bush
will get to the West Wing is a remote control!''

 &HT;    CONVENTION NOTEBOOK: FROM DELEGATE DELAYS TO POLICE CHASES
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Actress June Lockhart, best known for her TV roles
on ``Lassie'' and ``Lost in Space,'' watched a good portion of the
Democratic convention one night this week as she stood
shoulder-to-shoulder with photographers on the main camera stand
directly across from the podium on the convention floor. Lockhart
has been friends with many Washington-based photographers since the
mid-80's, having met some during Ronald Reagan's frequent trips to
his presidential ranch in California. She attends the annual White
House News Photographers Awards dinner in Washington every year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the convention nears its end, there have been mounting
complaints about transportation provided for delegates and members
of the press. Some buses, designated to shuttle them from their
hotels to the downtown convention site and back, have showed up
very late.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, some delegates probably wished their bus hadn't
shown up at all. A bus load of Georgia delegates wound up calling
police on a cell phone when a shuttle driver refused to let them
off at their hotel. Three Los Angeles sheriff's vehicles, lights
flashing, stopped the bus and escorted passengers from the vehicle,
the delegates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is the drivers haven't been instructed properly,''
Georgia party chairman David Worley told irritated delegates, some
of whom said they rode around for two hours on a bus when the
driver got lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been enormous screw-ups with transportation,''
Worley said. ``It's a major problem.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Each day of the convention is like any other party for the Ohio
delegates. Have a good time. Play hard. But when it's over, take me
home.
</P>
<P>
   That last part hasn't been easy. On Monday a violent clash
between police and protesters blocked streets after the convention
closed. Those fortunate enough to get a seat on a shuttle bus were
stuck and others had to walk more than a mile just to search for a
taxi.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, post-convention sailing appeared to be smooth for about
50 delegates as their shuttle bus headed back to the hotel. Then
came the crash
</P>
<P>
   A $50,000 sports car rammed a $40,000 SUV next to the bus on a
crowded Los Angeles street. A police officer accompanying the bus
riders got off to assist those involved in thes Jim Clyburn, the
Democratic congressman from South Carolina who chairs the caucus,
took the podium. He soberly looked out over the star-dotted
audience. It included Telma Hopkins, whose initial fame came from
being part of Tony Orlando's Dawn, the singer's backup crooners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good Lord has been good to me today,'' Clyburn announced.
``He made it so that I would not get to meet Telma Hopkins until I
was 60 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because,'' he added, ``I spent a certain amount of time in my
former life drooling over Telma Hopkins.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins giggled and turned a deep shade of red.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Howard Metzenbaum, the feisty 83-year-old former three-term
senator from Ohio, has speech Tuesday to the Ohio delegation,

 &HT;    LEWIS 'AT PEACE' WITH MESSAGE ON LIEBERMAN
 &HT;    By MELANIE EVERSLEY
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Just hours before introducing vice presidential
nominee Joe Lieberman to the Democratic National Convention on
Wednesday, Rep. John Lewis was more worried about his voice than
his message.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic congressman from Atlanta said he was ``at peace
with himself'' about what he was going to say.
</P>
<P>
   But popping two slippery elm lozenges into his mouth, he said he
was concerned that his voice would not hold up. Apparently, all the
speaking Lewis has been doing during this gathering of 4,300
Democratic delegates has put a strain on his voice box.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, though, Lewis's vocal cords seemed just fine
as he roused the Gay and Lesbian Democratic Caucus to a standing
ovation, telling a story he has recounted many times of how, as a
boy, he and other children in his family helped hold down his Aunt
Seneva's house during a horrible storm.
</P>
<P>
   As the story goes, a nasty storm wound its way through Troy,
Ala. As each corner of the small house seemed to rise from the
ground, Lewis' aunt instructed the children to run toward that
specific corner. The children did that, back and forth, until the
storm subsided. It is a story Lewis tells often to illustrate how
persistence can win, even if one has little with which to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were little children walking with the wind,'' Lewis told
the room of 200 delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of you have been walking with the wind, but you never
even left the house,'' he shouted. ``I say to you, as members of
the gay and lesbian community, as delegates, as Democrats, that the
thunder may roll and the lightning may flash and the rain may fall,
but you must never, ever leave the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis told the delegates who represent the gay and lesbian
community that he could not reveal the exact nature of his speech
to Lieberman later that night, but he did give them this hint: ``I
know you will feel good about some of the things I will say in the
introduction.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Lewis brushed shoulders with the glitterati at a luncheon
at Paramount Studios filled with the stars of the Congressional
Black Caucus and the stars of Hollywood. Among them: Rep. Mel Watt,
D-N.C., entertainer RuPaul, black caucus chairman Jim Clyburn,
D-S.C., Stan Shaw, Rep. Al Wynn, D-Md., actor LeVar Burton and
others. Lewis sat next to actress Alfre Woodard, the two of them
occasionally whispering to each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just talking about the campaign,'' Lewis said, adding
he'd met Woodard while on tour with the autobiography he published
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was scheduled to speak Wednesday night just before
Hadassah Lieberman, who will then bring her husband onto the
podium.
</P>
<P>
   Though some critics have raised questions about Lieberman's
commitment to issues important to the African-American community,
Lewis said he did not see this as a threat to minority support for
the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to be a major problem,'' Lewis said.
``The great majority of African-American delegates are with Senator
Lieberman. It's clear we have a choice to make, and with Bush and
Cheney we go back. With Al and Joe we go forward. Hopefully, we can
speed up the process of going forward,'' Lewis said.

COMMENTARY: GORE'S AUDIBLE IN BISHKEK 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In his you-never-had-it-so-good stemwinder the
other night, Bill Clinton twice deftly stepped on applause lines
for Joe Lieberman. Concentered all in self, the reluctantly
departing president failed to impart a single behind-the-scenes
anecdote to dramatize the leadership qualities of his loyal
sidekick, Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Thus it falls to a scandalmonger who has relentlessly castigated
the vice president for his fund-raising excesses to provide a
behind-the-scenes glimpse of Al and Tipper Gore under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1993. Air Force Two was taking the vice president,
his wife and a handful of reporters around the newly freed states
of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour before, the pilot had made two aborted passes at the
short airstrip in befogged Almaty, Kazakhstan. Because the plane
was running low on fuel, he landed at nearby Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan,
where the Americans were not expected to arrive until the next day.
</P>
<P>
   During refueling, the pilot offered to try again to get into
Almaty, where a grand state dinner was laid on. A critical go-no-go
was about to be decided: Would the vice president demonstrate that
the U.S. was unafraid of fog, even at the risk of life?
</P>
<P>
   I slipped up toward the front cabin, eager to witness Gore make
this command decision. Through a slit in the curtain, I could see
and hear arguments presented: Oil-rich Kazakhstan, which could be
wooed further away from Russia, might be put off by American
queasiness about landing. Diplomats fretted. The gutsy pilot
thought he could make it on another try.
</P>
<P>
   Gore glanced toward Tipper. Arms folded, she almost
imperceptibly shook her head. I thought: Sensible woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're calling an audible,'' the vice president said, his voice
like thin ice breaking, his metaphor that of a quarterback making a
last-second adjustment. ``Let's flop the schedule. Stay here
tonight and switch everything around.''
</P>
<P>
   He got on the telephone to the two presidents, delaying one
dinner and stunning the Bishkek boss with ``You know that formal
state dinner planned for tomorrow night? How about you round
everybody up and we'll have it an hour from now?''
</P>
<P>
   It worked. False machismo was rejected, the hosts understood the
concern for safety, and we members of the press didn't know the
difference between Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan anyway.
</P>
<P>
   That struck me as leadership in action. Gore's creative
audible-calling demonstrated a wise willingness in a tight spot to
listen to the cautious counsel of his wife.
</P>
<P>
   What a pity that Clinton could not come up with a similarly
dramatic instance of leadership _ perhaps even one dealing with
substantive policy that required a profile in courage. But that
might have detracted from Clinton's self-image of being in total
charge at all times.
</P>
<P>
   On the rest of that tour of Russia and its adjacent new
republics, I had several opportunities to talk privately with the
person the background rules require I must still refer to only as a
high official with a wooden expression traveling on the vice
president's plane.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out he had been egregiously misinformed by State and
the CIA about the upcoming Russian election: The sudden rise of the
nutty Vladimir Zhirinovsky came as a complete surprise to U.S.
intelligence. And his judgment about certain Russian leaders was,
in retrospect, too optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   But he knew his stuff. The unnameable official had not only done
his briefing-book homework, but had a hard-wired strategic outlook
that takes years to develop. I disagreed with some of his policy
conclusions but had to respect his knowledge of the weaknesses and
foibles of his foreign interlocutors and his grasp of the
intricacies of high-level wheeling and dealing.
</P>
<P>
   None of that will be on display in Thursday night's acceptance
speech because foreign policy has no place in either party's
convention. With peace a given, the Democratic nominee's message
will be ``Don't let them take prosperity away.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not seduce me. But as Al ingratiates himself with
self-deprecating humor and lays out to the assembled
teacher-delegates and tree-huggers his vision of a debt-free
Treasury, I will not be so quick to join the personality-driven
chorus of derision because I remember the audible in Bishkek. (BOX)

   LOS ANGELES _ Members of Alabama's delegation to the Democratic
National Convention watched the recent GOP convention on television
and didn't like what they saw. To them, the black and white control
needed a little adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   African-American convention-goers from the state say they were
offended by GOP efforts to use the meeting in Philadelphia to
project an aura of racial inclusivity, when Alabama's GOP
delegation was almost totally white and dominated by men.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic contingent, with more than 50 percent minority
membership and a black chairman, better represents the true face of
a state with a significant African-American population, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It showed their true colors, they are not really inclusive,''
said Helen Carter, a delegate from Birmingham. She noted that even
though she is African-American, she was elected as a delegate in
the white majority congressional district of GOP Rep. Spencer
Bachus.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Reed of Montgomery, the head of the delegation, ridiculed
the GOP strategy of giving such black Republicans as retired Gen.
Colin Powell and Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma prominent speaking
roles at a convention where the vast majority of the audience was
white.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic officials noted that the Alabama GOP delegation
had no black delegates until one was named to replace an ailing
white delegate who could not attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was an insult for them to go out and lasso a black
man, tie him up to take him to the convention and then say we don't
discriminate,'' Reed said. The Democratic effort is much more
sincere, he said. ``We are trying to have full participation of
women and minorities,'' Reed added.
</P>
<P>
   National Democratic Party rules set standards for diversity in
delegations, including requiring they be at least 50 percent
female.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, hoping to show that the compassionate conservatism
ideology of nominee George W. Bush was making their party more
appealing to minorities, sought to highlight their African-American
members by putting them front and center on the podium. Condoleezza
Rice, an Alabama native and top foreign policy adviser to Bush, was
among them.
</P>
<P>
   Countering criticism from Democrats and the media that the GOP
convention was something of an illusion, Republicans said it was
fair to spotlight Republican minorities in an effort to swell their
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Kinney, executive director of the Alabama Democratic
Party, said the low minority composition of the GOP delegation
stemmed from the fact that the party has not embraced positions
that appeal to minorities and instead continues to resist popular
policies such as affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is extremely easy to make claims of being a racially
diverse group and a group that is reaching out to minorities,'' he
said. ``It is much more difficult to do something, do things that
attract people to your party.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter said she viewed the GOP convention as an effort to hijack
the Democrat message of welcoming minorities, but she believes most
people see through the tactic.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what they were trying to imitate,'' she said. ``But it
didn't work.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   A Gallup poll taken in July confirmed the obvious: The Harry
Potter books are being read by everyone this summer. Well, almost
everyone. Children in low-income families are much less likely to
read Harry than their counterparts in middle- and upper-income
families.
</P>
<P>
   This finding will not surprise education experts or teachers,
who have known for decades that economically disadvantaged children
fall behind during the summer months compared with their peers. The
problem is that children from low-income families are less likely
to read Harry Potter or much else during the summer, which causes
their skills to atrophy when school is out of session.
</P>
<P>
   What might be called the ``Harry Potter divide'' _ the depressed
level of academic engagement in poor households when school is out
_ is responsible for a major part of the gap in achievement between
low- and high-income students.
</P>
<P>
   The achievement gap has important economic consequences. Several
studies indicate that students who score one standard deviation
higher on math and reading tests _ comparing those at the 15th
percentile to those at the 50th percentile, say _ earn, on average,
15 to 20 percent more a year as adults. And a new study by
Christopher Jencks of Harvard University and Meredith Phillips of
the University of California at Los Angeles found that high school
was not too late to make a difference: those whose math test scores
increased between 10th and 12th grades achieved higher incomes
later in life compared with those who started at the same level but
did not raise their scores.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, raising achievement pays off, and it pays off more
today than in the past because the information age has increased
the demand for skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   Labor force projections, however, indicate a slowdown in the
growth of skilled workers in the next two decades, so the
achievement gap between lower-income students and their
counterparts from more affluent families could crimp the expansion
of the economy. In my view, the summer learning deficit is more
worrisome for economic growth than the trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The latest and probably best research on the summer learning gap
is in a 1997 book, ``Children, Schools and Inequality'' (Westview
Press) by Doris Entwisle, Karl Alexander and Linda Olson of Johns
Hopkins University. The three authors are sociologists who have
been studying a random sample of 800 Baltimore public school
students ever since they entered first grade in 1982. At the
beginning and end of each school year, students took the California
Achievement Test.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers examined gains and losses in test scores over
the school year and summer break. Students were classified into
groups on the basis of their parents' socioeconomic status, which
depended on their education, occupation and income.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, children from high and low socioeconomic-status
families made equivalent gains on math and reading exams during the
school year. But the achievement level of children from low-income
families either fell or stagnated during the summer, while children
from higher income families continued to make progress.
</P>
<P>
   The entire achievement gap between children from low- and
high-income families arises from periods when school is out of
session and from before children enroll in school. This pattern,
which also holds in other studies, suggests that public schools are
doing more to help poor children overcome the obstacles they face
in their homes and neighborhoods than is commonly appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans and Democrats spar over using vouchers to
reform public schools, a potential solution to the achievement gap
has been overlooked. Why not give low-income parents a scholarship,
or voucher, to send their children to some type of a summer
learning program?
</P>
<P>
   The idea of school vouchers, which is frequently attributed to
Milton Friedman but dates back at least to Thomas Paine, has become
``radioactive'' among Democrats, as Jonathan Orzsag, a former
official for President Clinton's National Economic Council, put it.
So call this something else, such as Summer Opportunity
Scholarships _ SOS for short.
</P>
<P>
   Only 9 percent of students in the United States attend summer
school. Unlike other voucher programs, summer school scholarships
would supplement, rather than substitute for, the traditional
public school system.
</P>
<P>
   The 180-day school year in the United States _ a legacy of a
bygone era when children were needed to work the farm in the summer
_ is short by international standards. By the end of high school,
children in Japan, for example, have had the equivalent of four
more years of schooling than American children. Although it would
be desirable to use the 180-day school year more constructively,
one thing is clear: more time on task helps students learn.
</P>
<P>
   Summer school raises achievement if it is focused on specific
academic goals, said Harris Cooper of the University of Missouri.
Cooper, who just published a review of 93 evaluations of separate
summer school programs, said the effect of summer school on student
achievement was ``clearly positive,'' either when performance was
compared to participants' pre-summer scores or to a randomly
selected control group of nonparticipants.
</P>
<P>
   But summer school runs into a roadblock. Many families and
teachers do not want to be in school year round. Mandated summer
school attendance also carries a stigma, and such programs
typically cater to older children who are already far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Summer scholarships offer a solution. Families could be given a
refundable tax credit or cash grant if they send their children to
a competent academic enrichment program during the summer. A range
of options already exist, including public school-sponsored summer
schools, private tutoring organizations such as Sylvan and Kumon
learning centers, and education-oriented camps.
</P>
<P>
   Too many children are forced to endure summers like the mythical
Harry Potter of Privet Drive. No books, no trips, no visits to the
library; only a television and loyal owl for company. Giving
low-income families scholarships to send their children to summer
enrichment programs could help narrow the achievement gap and
better prepare the work force of tomorrow.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was your typical Democratic National Convention
fund-raiser, under glittering chandeliers in a hotel ballroom, with
candidates in full cry at the podium and 1,000 well-dressed guests
who paid $250 each for their cold chicken and see themselves as
big-league political power players.
</P>
<P>
   And they are. They hand-pick candidates, train them, supply them
with expert campaign staff, mobilize voters and deliver cash _ lots
of cash. They put people in office.
</P>
<P>
   They are almost all women, from the candidates on the platform
to the check-writers in the audience _ the women of Emily's List.
</P>
<P>
   The feminist political fund-raising organization that began as
one woman with an idea and a Rolodex in her basement has grown in
15 years into ``the biggest funder of federal candidates in the
country,'' according to founder Ellen Malcolm.
</P>
<P>
   Emily's List backs only pro-choice Democratic women candidates
running for congressional or gubernatorial office. With 60,000
members nationwide, the group can pump more than $1 million in
contributions to a candidate. The political action committee of
Emily's List has more financial muscle than the Teamsters Union.
About 10 percent of Emily's List contributors are men.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now a real financial powerhouse and obviously that's
translating into a historic number of wins for women candidates,''
Malcolm said with pride.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is all around here in California. Malcolm welcomed
to the platform a succession of women elected with the help of
Emily's List money, including both of the state's senators, Dianne
Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, one of the
state's 12 women members of the House. Pelosi could become the
majority whip next year if the Democrats regain control of the
chamber this November.
</P>
<P>
   Operating with a budget this election cycle of $28 million and a
staff of 41, Emily's List is backing 24 women so far this year.
Their marquee candidates are Hillary Rodham Clinton, running for
senator in New York, and Debbie Stabenow, who is seeking a Senate
seat in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Emily's List is ``very important and very effective,'' said
Democratic National Chairman Edward Rendell.
</P>
<P>
   In the battle to control the House, only 12 Democrats have been
able to raise more than $1 million so far, and eight of them are
women who are receiving Emily's List backing.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me it's just a delight to see these women run in these
tough races and come out the winner,'' Malcolm said. ``We've never
been able to do that before. We've made history in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always that way, of course. When she began the
organization, Malcolm recalls, it was common for the men who
dominated the Democratic Party to deny funding to women who wanted
to run for office on grounds that they were not viable candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they wouldn't give them any money, the women couldn't
become viable candidates, so they were really trapped in this
vicious circle,'' Malcolm said. ``Emily raises early money for
women because our strategy was that if we could get them started
and put some money in the bank and get them a poll, they could
convince the old boys that they were viable candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked. In the seven elections since Emily was founded, the
group has helped elect seven Democratic women senators, 49 members
of Congress and three female governors.
</P>
<P>
   The organization takes its name from a political slogan: Early
Money Is Like Yeast. (It makes dough rise.)
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I wondered who Emily was,'' laughed Pat Rich of
Beverly Hills, who became a member of the group five years ago.
``Who's the martyr we're named after, the poor, downtrodden `Emily'
victimized by the Republicans?''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Wright of Los Angeles said she is an Emily's List member
because the organization ``focuses on all the issues that matter to
women: abortion, guns, children.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Duff, a longtime activist from New York, said the
``smartest thing'' Emily's List did was broaden its role in 1994 to
include voter mobilization efforts targeting women with special
mailings and telephone outreach, in addition to fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi said the success of Emily's List may make it possible to
double the number of women in Congress by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Women have three vital interests in this year's presidential
election, according to Boxer: ``The Supreme Court, the Supreme
Court and the Supreme Court.'' She was talking about the
probability that the next president will appoint one or more new
Supreme Court justices during his tenure, changing the narrow
five-to-four majority that now upholds abortion rights for women.
</P>
<P>
   Republican George W. Bush is firmly opposed to abortion and his
party's platform calls for the appointment of judges who would ban
all abortions, though Bush has said he would not apply such a
litmus test to his judicial appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Al Gore supports abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democrats are worried because Bush leads Gore among
women in most polls, a reversal of the trend in past elections when
Republicans suffered from a so-called gender gap among women
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to be concerned about the Democrats, the big
question is whether the women are coming back or not,'' said Robert
Strauss, a former Democratic national chairman. ``That's Gore's
problem, the women's vote. Is he going to be able to get it back?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and the Democrats need not worry too much, according to
Malcolm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters are just bouncing around right now,'' she said. ``Women
think George W. Bush seems like a nice fellow and maybe they'll
vote for him. But when they really start focusing on their
decision, they're going to look at the issues, see who they agree
with and who they don't, and who is the leader who is going to take
the people forward. We're going to see a big shift. Women are going
to come back to the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   The big test ahead for Emily's List is whether it can deliver on
that promise.

<P>
   Just what do anti-globalization activists really want? How would
they change the international economic landscape? And what would
happen if those reforms actually took place?
</P>
<P>
   Activists blame the globalization of business for a host of
ills: lowering wages worldwide, polluting developing nations,
destroying well-paying U.S. manufacturing jobs, threatening unions
and widening the income gap between rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
   What the new gathering of environmentalists, unionists,
humanists and anarchists can't agree on is what to do with the
economy if they ever get hold of it.
</P>
<P>
   While some activists just want to tweak the booming system of
corporate-friendly international capitalism, others want to destroy
it. Proposals range from raising the U.S. minimum wage $1 an hour _
something both major parties back _ to having the government break
up large corporations or even kill off companies that don't operate
in the public interest.
</P>
<P>
   But, broadly speaking, the activists back a set of proposals
that point toward a new economy _ one with more government
regulation of business and trade, higher minimum wages and stricter
environmental standards, and rules that channel wealth from rich
executives and corporations to workers.
</P>
<P>
   The ideas could profoundly change what Americans pay and earn,
whom we work for and how we'll save for retirement. Nobody knows
for sure what the consequences of such reform might be, but experts
agree that the activists' proposals would tend to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Increase wages for many U.S. workers, especially the
lowest-paid Americans _ and perhaps raise wages for workers
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   _ Push the inflation rate up, especially for heavily imported
items such as clothing, while dragging down the prices of some
items such as apples.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cut into the profits of major international corporations,
probably limiting their growth and prompting layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Drag down the stock market, especially lowering the stock
prices of big international companies such as Nike, Unocal and
Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   - Boost the fortunes of some smaller domestic companies, as well
as those big corporations that already meet high wage and
environmental standards.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters like those gathered outside this week's Democratic
National Convention in Los Angeles hope the changes would also
redistribute wealth from the top tiers of society _ the richest
executives and investors _ down to the poorest Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Actual effects depend on whether the moderate or radical ideas
prevail and how quickly reform takes place. Intricate relationships
among trade, corporate growth, wages and prices make results harder
to predict. And as with all economics and politics, no one can
agree on whether a new system would help most Americans or create a
recession that would undermine our way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for instance, one hot-button topic _ what companies
pay foreign workers who make sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   Some protesters propose trading only with nations and companies
that pay a living wage. The definition of a living wage is nebulous
and hotly debated, but advocates say it should cover living
expenses for a worker and, some say, for the worker's family.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates for a U.S. living wage range from $6.50 an hour to
more than $8 an hour, not including health care coverage, according
to reform-minded groups including the New Party and Global
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Indonesia, some activists estimate that the
country's living wage is from 40 percent to 100 percent above its
minimum monthly wage of 286,000 rupiah, or about $33.50.
</P>
<P>
   Factories in Indonesia produce about a third of Nike's shoes.
Right now, a pair of shoes that retails for $65 costs stores about
$32.50 and costs Nike about $16.25, the company says. Of that
$16.25, $2.43 goes for labor _ though Nike's critics say the labor
cost is much lower, about $1.
</P>
<P>
   If Indonesian wages rose 40 percent, that would raise the labor
cost to Nike by about $1. At that point, Nike could choose to
either eat the increase, cutting its profits, or pass it on.
Retailers would face a similar choice. If everyone passed the cost
on, the $65 pair of shoes would cost $69.
</P>
<P>
   Nike rivals who also manufacture in Indonesia, such as Adidas,
would face similar price pressures, but shoes made domestically,
such as some New Balance models, would not.
</P>
<P>
   What's not easy to foresee is how many buyers would flinch at a
$4 price hike, for instance, and buy other shoes instead. Or
whether the price increase would hit consumers as higher costs or
stockholders as lower profits.
</P>
<P>
   It's also hard to predict the effect on Indonesian workers.
Small wage increases won't discourage companies, economists say,
but if Indonesia's wages suddenly get much bigger than competitors
such as China or Vietnam, Nike might move operations to those
nations.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   The hypothetical question is hard to answer, Nike spokesman Vada
Manager said. When deciding where to make shoes, Nike considers not
only manufacturing costs, but also tariffs, how skilled a country's
workers are, even the origins of materials.
</P>
<P>
   That's just one of the complex and confusing chains of causes
and effects that would influence a whole range of economic
activities _ wheat exports, oil imports, international trade in
lumber, steel and so on _ if the rules of international trade
changed.
</P>
<P>
   But protesters seem willing to risk the unknowns. They say that
allowing more global trade, without coupling that trade with wage
and labor standards, has let the wealthiest companies and
executives get even richer at the expense of poorer nations and
workers.

<P>
   Most labor activists from developing nations live lives of
unsung determination. But Roselio Reyes is a minor celebrity,
thanks to the publicity wars dominating the debate over global
trade.
</P>
<P>
   An earnest 22-year-old, Reyes used to work at a Nike apparel
factory in the Dominican Republic. A few years ago, Reyes says, he
was told to work overtime or quit. He quit, so he could go to
school, and since has been working to unionize his former
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   The story would end there, except Reyes hooked up with some of
the most determined and vocal activist groups waging the battle to
change big U.S. apparel companies, and Nike in particular. These
groups, including United Students Against Sweatshops, are among the
vanguard of an effort to put the brakes on unfettered corporate
globalization and to promote better wages and working conditions
for laborers.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes is now on his second activist-sponsored U.S. tour in two
years, hoping to drum up interest in global trade issues. He's
traveling with nine young activists in a Ford Chateau Sport RV,
protesting in sports stadiums and NikeTown stores. The trip has
drawn coverage, including a Sports Illustrated story by the father
of one of the activists. There also is a Web site
(www.behindthelabel.org) that calls Reyes ``the superstar of our
`Say No to Nike Sweatshops' tour,'' as well as a ``snappily
dressed'' Libra and baseball fan.
</P>
<P>
   The elevation of Reyes, and others like him, into a protest
celebrity is the fruit of an activist movement working hard on the
public-relations front. At the same time, multinational
corporations have added public-relations specialists who
concentrate on presenting the company's side in the globalization
debate.
</P>
<P>
   These days, anti-corporate activists don't just cultivate
workers and bargain with management. They also pick out heroes _
and target corporate villains _ to draw the attention of U.S. media
and get their message to a broader public.
</P>
<P>
   Another tried-and-true tactic: orchestrating high-profile
marches and sit-ins, from November's World Trade Organization
protests in Seattle to the street theater during the Democratic
National Convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The new protest movement has relied heavily on PR out of
necessity, says B.J. Bullert, a documentarian and communications
researcher who has studied the phenomenon. For years, many
activists largely were ignored by the media, governments and the
companies they aimed to reform. Bullert says young activists who
grew up in a media-saturated age, including some full-time PR
advisers to protest groups, realized they needed to reach a wider
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know that if you can't get media attention,'' she says,
``you don't have a voice in the world any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The work of Jeff Ballinger, a longtime labor activist, is one
example, Bullert says. For years, Ballinger studied working
conditions in Asia, especially at Indonesian shoe and clothing
factories.
</P>
<P>
   His efforts received mass media attention largely after he
connected with Global Exchange, a protest group that has a
full-time PR worker and contacts among mainstream journalists. The
groups were able to garner press by framing the labor question as a
David and Goliath story between the big company and poor workers,
Bullert says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew they were vulnerable,'' Ballinger says of Nike.
``I just didn't have the media savvy'' to spread the story.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to trying to package their concerns as human
interest stories, protest groups have taken a cue from previous
generations of protesters and taken to the streets. The tactic
found its greatest success in Seattle, where mass protests _ met
with an aggressive city crackdown _ drew heavy media coverage and
helped turn global trade issues into a popular public topic.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the multinational companies that activists target also
have entered the PR fray, as corporate PR departments spend more
time talking about issues such as environmental responsibility and
labor conditions. Companies such as Shell, Ford and Texaco _
criticized as heavy polluters _ produce ads and Web sites touting
their environmental efforts. Other companies, most notably Nike,
publicize programs to increase wages and improve factory
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it was in part an offensive move and a defensive
move,'' says Vada Manager, a Nike spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Some activists worry that publicity and spin about globalization
has its problems, including the fact that complex controversies get
boiled down to a few easy-to-understand, good-vs.-evil stories.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Nike's factories, Ballinger says, most attention
focuses on wages. After Nike increased its wages several times, he
says, some activists are ready to declare victory and move on. But
Ballinger says much work still needs to be done to get factory
managers to bargain collectively with workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the public-relations dynamic takes over so thoroughly,''
he says, ``then you tend to lose the real message.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   As for Reyes, he says his time in the spotlight won his cause
modest success.
</P>
<P>
   His first trip to the United States _ a 1998 tour sponsored by
Unite, a garment-workers' union _ generated press, including a New
York Times report that accused Reyes' employer of paying low wages,
requiring overtime, abusing workers and firing union organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes says that after the stories ran, Nike visited Yupoon, the
Korean owner of his former factory. Management soon cleaned the
factory's bathrooms, installed a water-purification system and
increased overtime pay, Reyes says.
</P>
<P>
   With this trip, Reyes hopes public pressure will get Nike to
lean on factory management again, this time to accept a union at
the factory. He knows it's not likely. Unionization progress has
been slow, hampered by insufficient resources and by widespread
fear among workers that union backers will be fired. Besides, he
says, the factory does its own successful PR work in its village of
Villa Altagracia.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the community,'' Reyes says, ``its reputation is good.''

ANARCHISTS TURN LIBERAL COLLEGE TOWN INTO HOTHOUSE FOR REVOLUTION

<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ To the anarchists at Third Avenue and Van Buren
Street, it appeared the entire police department was dropping into
the Whiteaker neighborhood at once. Officers came on mountain
bikes, a motorcycle, a sport utility vehicle and on foot,
blanketing the corner in blue that recent afternoon. It seemed an
odd show of force given the target of their attention: a daily
coffee klatch.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every morning for 18 months, sleepy-eyed anarchists have
parked a wooden cart on the sidewalk to share free coffee and
days-old pastries with the poor. Regulars at Cafe Anarquista sip
strong organic java and loose the occasional rant against
technology and the cops. A wooden fence rises behind them, a
collage of graffiti and sun-faded fliers that encourage resistance
to authority.
</P>
<P>
   But on that recent day, there was no resistance, merely
submission to a police force that has had its fill of the local
revolutionaries. Officers assembled en masse, they later said, to
thwart a spontaneous uprising. They accused coffee drinkers of
blocking the sidewalk, issued $250 tickets to people who can barely
scare up rent money, and rode off.
</P>
<P>
   It was merely the latest brush between police and anarchists in
Whiteaker, a Bohemian neighborhood in west-end Eugene. Radicals
complain that they are being detained for as little as jaywalking
so police can videotape their tattoos, clothing and patches. A
wooden sign at Cafe Anarquista jokingly charts the intensity of the
``police occupation.'' A dial toggles from ``ominously quiet'' to
``omnipresent (carry rocks)'' to ``thoroughly agitated (fight
back).''
</P>
<P>
   City officials aren't laughing.
</P>
<P>
   They blame the growing clan of anarchists for a series of
sometimes riotous street demonstrations over the past 14 months. It
was a hometown fight until last fall, when a few of the local
revolutionaries helped turn downtown Seattle into a Beirut of
shattered storefronts, burning trash bins and spray-painted walls
outside meetings of the World Trade Organization. The revolt took
an ominous turn in June, when prosecutors accused two anarchists of
trying to set fire to a gasoline tanker in Whiteaker.
</P>
<P>
   Clans of anarchists _ based in Eugene and Portland in Oregon;
Seattle; Vancouver, British Columbia; and the San Francisco Bay
Area _ represent the most militant wing of an international
movement opposed to the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike their allies in the mass movement _ a much larger
coalition of peaceful labor activists, environmentalists and
human-rights workers _ hard-core anarchists have little interest in
reforming capitalism. They want to destroy the institutions, such
as government, that impose order on life.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Eugene's anarchists _ known as the Black Bloc _ advocate
``green anarchy,'' a theory that suggests humans were better off
before the advent of farming thousands of years ago. They argue
that primitives who hunted and gathered their food enjoyed freedoms
that modern humans, slaves to technology and the capitalist
treadmill, do not.
</P>
<P>
   The Eugene resistance is almost exclusively Anglo, a mish-mash
of radical environmentalists, feminists, philosophers, nomads and
outlaws. Many live in Whiteaker, and their median age is perhaps
25. Most were raised in middle-class families, although some grew
up poor. They stay fed with oddly contradictory jobs such as
telemarketing. They are dreadlocked and tattooed, profane and
sometimes profound. Mostly, they are disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Some have suffered the consequences of parents cast aside by the
whims of industry. Others have fought relentless battles to save
ancient trees from logging.
</P>
<P>
   Many strike back at the system in subtle ways, although some of
their methods sound less like politics than excuses for
boorishness. They brag about dropping litter in wealthy
neighborhoods and shoplifting from corporate chain stores.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to pinpoint the moment Eugene went from being a
liberal college town to a hothouse for the revolution. The city of
133,000 has long been a drop zone for hippies, free thinkers and
militants.
</P>
<P>
   But the nature of the revolt has changed, said Officer Jennifer
Bills, who has worked in Whiteaker for four years. Police and
activists used to negotiate terms of arrests before protests, but
anarchists now rarely talk with police, she said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Tensions came to a head in June, when two days of street
demonstrations resulted in 63 arrests. Some Eugene residents
complained that police _ firing beanbag rounds and pepper spray _
overreacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the anarchists we're afraid of, it's the police,''
Eugene resident Craig Miller testified at a June 27 public forum.
However, Miller, 43, acknowledged, ``there's a lot of foolishness
on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that hot night, a few anarchists took a table at the Pizza
Research Center, analyzing the public forum. They agreed the June
18 demonstration _ brought to order by 100 officers from Eugene and
two other agencies _ was overkill that merely inflamed the public.
Which was more or less good news, said Robin Terranova: ``The
police are much better at radicalizing people than we are.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   The day after police swept Cafe Anarquista, the regulars were
back, hand-rolling cigarettes, drinking java out of Mason jars and
petting ``Riot,'' the striped cat.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, police returned and tacked a notice of their
own on the ``free space'' fence: Because of complaints from
neighbors, officers would strictly enforce all sidewalk, roadway
and trespass laws there beginning July 24.
</P>
<P>
   The regulars showed up that Monday with cameras and a few
reporters. Coffee was served, pastries eaten. But police didn't
show. When they cleared out, sunshine fell on the free space fence.

   PORTLAND, Ore. _ The new protest movement against the global
economy is out to keep jobs in the USA, save sea turtles, free
Tibet, cancel the debt of poor nations, stop biotechnology, smash
sweatshops, spare the rain forests and _ depending on the activist
_ mend or mutilate the capitalist system.
</P>
<P>
   Will the real revolution please stand up?
</P>
<P>
   The movement, which converged this week on the Democratic
National Convention in Los Angeles, has no name but some nifty Web
sites. It looks like the '60s and sounds like a percussion
ensemble. Its primary gripe is corporate greed _ yet some key
organizing groups have accepted money from corporate luminaries
such as Ted Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters largely are a mixed bag of reformers, with a few
doomsayers who'd just as soon tear it all down and start over.
Their demonstrations are free-for-alls of human-rights activists,
environmentalists and union workers.
</P>
<P>
   They are civilly disobedient, sometimes riotous, and don't
always get along. But they are unified by a common belief: Big
corporations are gaining more of the world's wealth on the backs of
poor people, while tearing up the natural world.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles police canceled vacation time for more than 9,000
sworn officers during the convention. They warned corporate chains
such as Starbucks to be alert for vandals. And Mayor Richard J.
Riordan told activists beforehand that police would be tough on
lawbreakers.
</P>
<P>
   Mass protests have turned three other big U.S. cities on their
ears in the past year. The movement clogged Seattle's downtown
streets with perhaps 30,000 bodies during last fall's protests of
the World Trade Organization. Lesser disruptions met officials of
the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C.,
last spring, and delegates with the Republican National Convention
earlier this month in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The movement is accused of having too many special interests to
foment a real revolution. It's been criticized for being vastly
white and middle-class. And some say it attracts comfortable
American kids who lack the powerful causes their parents marched
for in the 1960s -- civil rights and an end to the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   But to Shannon Wright, an organizer for the 20,000-member
Rainforest Action Network, based in San Francisco, something is
building that already has refocused activism in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think we are seeing a new era of activism that we haven't
seen since the '60s,'' Wright said. ``It represents many walks of
life: students, stay-at-home moms, retired people. We're getting
back to free-speech demonstrations and writing letters to Congress.
It's a new era of citizen participation.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons? Too many people think government responds to
corporate interests first, citizens' interests later, she said, and
they are worried about the environment. ``People,'' she said,
``feel it's time to get involved.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's easier than ever to get involved, especially if you
have a personal computer and a modem.
</P>
<P>
   Groups organize protests on Internet sites that outline the time
and date of the next demonstration, when to gather and what to
bring. These home pages list local organizers, who set up meetings
in advance so protesters can form into affinity groups.
</P>
<P>
   Those groups, typically five to 20 people, meet to decide
strategies. They designate members to mediate with police, speak to
news reporters, run video cameras, act as peacekeepers and get
their friends out of jail.
</P>
<P>
   And they train.
</P>
<P>
   Last Nov. 13, two dozen people brought together by Direct Action
Network gathered in the University of Oregon's student union to set
up affinity groups and practice the art of peaceful protest before
the WTO. Veteran activists, including Karen Coulter of Fossil,
Ore., spelled out the rules of engagement for Seattle: no weapons,
no drugs or alcohol, no vandalism and no violence -- physical or
verbal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the entire city to play with,'' Coulter said.
</P>
<P>
   The activists, mostly college students, sat on a tan linoleum
floor and locked arms in role-plays to simulate confrontations with
police, such as being pried apart and clubbed with nightsticks.
They learned helpful hints: Tie your hair back so it can't be
yanked. Remove earrings so they can't be ripped out. Avoid boots
because in tangles of protesters they always end up in someone's
face. And screech in pain when police grab you, whether or not it
hurts.
</P>
<P>
   Many get news of the revolution from other activists, logging on
to various independent media Web sites specifically for mass
mobilizations.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Moynihan, a Boston carpenter by day and protest organizer
by night, helped set up the so-called ``indy media'' site for the
WTO. It came together hours before protests with the help of
donated computers and a slew of volunteer techies. It was a
low-budget affair in which volunteers worked around the clock,
eating ``dumpster-dive food,'' Moynihan said.
</P>
<P>
   The site got more than 1 million hits in the first 24 hours, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   The movement's harmonic convergence isn't always harmonious.
</P>
<P>
   When roving bands of militants left more than $2 million in
damages to the downtown Seattle business district at the WTO
demonstration, many peaceful protesters blanched. A few stood
between the black-clad militants and the plate-glass windows of
corporate chain stores to prevent them from being broken, shouting,
``Shame, shame.'' They felt that vandalism would give the larger
protest movement a black eye before the world's media.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents reopened a debate as old as the Boston Tea Party:
Are nonviolent crimes an appropriate form of protest?
</P>
<P>
   Many activists argue that ``direct action,'' a movement
euphemism for a wide range of crimes _ from civil disobedience to
arson _ should not surpass sit-ins and passive resistance. But they
acknowledge that peaceful marches don't always draw much attention
from the public.
</P>
<P>
   Anarchists weren't gunning for headlines at the WTO, said
anarchist John Zerzan, but it just so happens they upstaged
mainstream marchers. Zerzan, of Eugene, Ore., returned from Seattle
and spoke out against activists who bad-mouthed the vandalism _ or
tried to stop it _ saying their allegiances were to corporations,
not the movement.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Such comments didn't sit well with many activists, some of whom
gathered at Portland State University in late May to dissect the
mass demonstrations in Seattle and D.C. at the third annual End
Corporate Dominance Alliance conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revolution is a mass undertaking,'' said Gary Bills, a
50-year-old Teamsters member who drives a forklift for Freightliner
in Portland. It disturbed him that a bunch of rogue anarchists in
baggy black clothes had decided for themselves to smash up windows,
rather than operate within the coalition of peaceful protesters.
``Zerzan,'' he said, ``broke solidarity with me.''
</P>
<P>
   The anarchists, for their part, criticized polite protesters and
the salaried ``professional activists'' who organize mass
demonstrations. And they insisted it will take more than glossy
mailings and tax-deductible donations to bring about a revolution
against the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Much of the mass movement's organizing is performed by a trio of
Bay Area groups that have come into existence since 1985: The
Ruckus Society, which trains activists in nonviolent civil
disobedience; Global Exchange, which directs attention to labor and
human-rights issues; and the Rainforest Action Network, which
focuses on the environment.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Ruckus was founded five years ago by Mike Roselle, a co-founder
of Earth First, the radical environmental group. With a budget of
more than $350,000, the Berkeley-based group trains activists in
tactics such as street theater, body blockades and scaling
buildings. The group sponsors ``action camps'' nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Media magnate Ted Turner paid for some of that training through
grants from the Turner Foundation that amounted to about $50,000
last year. The foundation also gave money to the Rainforest Action
Network, which this year claims a $2.7 million budget. But Turner
recently pulled the plug on Ruckus' money, after its
well-publicized involvement at the WTO, said Han Shan, the
society's 27-year-old program director.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our foundation office the word was, `Ted likes the
WTO,''' Shan said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, no matter how much funding grass-roots groups such as the
Ruckus Society get, it's but a fraction of the money being spent to
counter them, observed Dick Roy, a former corporate attorney. Roy
quit his comfortable full-time job in 1993 to co-found the
Portland-based Northwest Earth Institute. He remains unsurprised by
the money corporations spend to counter grass-roots protests.
</P>
<P>
   For example, seven biotech companies ponied up $50 million
earlier this year to launch a council that puts a positive spin on
genetic engineering of agriculture. The science concerns many
environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we are a tiny, tiny minority of people who want
to safeguard the environment, protect human rights and get rid of
sweatshops,'' Shan said. ``I think that we are the vast majority.
But there's this thing called money. ... We've got a culture that
values that more.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who made
an unsuccessful run for the presidency, has been diagnosed with
malignant melanoma, a potentially severe form of skin cancer, on
his temple and arm, his aides said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who was successfully treated for malignant melanoma in
1993 when doctors removed a mole from his shoulder, was scheduled
to undergo more tests on Thursday and Friday at the Mayo Clinic in
Scottsdale, Ariz., and did not yet know the seriousness of his
condition.
</P>
<P>
   After the tests are complete, McCain will discuss the best
treatment options, which can range from minor surgery, if the
cancer is caught early, to chemotherapy, in the later stages.
Malignant melanoma is the most deadly form of skin cancer and the
least common, but if it is caught early it can be highly curable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spots were confirmed to be melanomas after an Aug. 4
biopsy performed at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda,
Md.,'' according to a statement from McCain's office.
</P>
<P>
   Since his 1993 brush with cancer, McCain had been closely
monitored by doctors, who periodically removed suspicious moles or
lesions from his skin. Most of these lesions consisted of basal
cell carcinoma, the least worrisome and most common type of skin
cancer. Doctors had declared him cured last year, since the
malignant melanoma had not recurred for five years.
</P>
<P>
   The type of cancer McCain suffers from is sometimes associated
with prolonged exposure to the sun. The senator was a prisoner of
war for more than five years when his Navy jet was shot down over
North Vietnam, and during his captivity he was often exposed to the
sun.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had told few people about the latest diagnosis and
planned to go public with the information after he learned more
from doctors this week, but he did tell Gov. George W. Bush, who
defeated him for the Republican presidential nomination, last week
when Bush stopped by McCain's Arizona ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``During a routine examination two unrelated spots were
discovered on Sen. John McCain. One is on his left temple, the
other on his left arm,'' said the statement released by his office.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will turn 64 on Aug. 29.

 &HT;    PGA Championship opens today with Woods - who else? - as
favorite.
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. - They thought Pebble Beach might bring more
players into U.S. Open contention and help derail the Tiger Woods
onslaught. They said the same thing about St. Andrews before the
British Open.
</P>
<P>
   And now they're saying that Valhalla Golf Club is the type of
TPC-like venue that should open doors for many at the 82nd PGA
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Be serious. If Woods runs away again, as he has in winning the
U.S. Open by 15 shots and the British Open by eight, it won't
matter if one or 100 players tie for second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we thought St. Andrews would bring more people in
because it was hard and bouncy, and it didn't,'' Scotland's Colin
Montgomerie said. ``We thought Pebble Beach would bring people in
because it might get windy, and it didn't. . . . The guy seems to
be quite good on any surface he plays. . . . I think any golf
tournament plays into Tiger's hands right now. He's the guy with
the confidence. He's the best player in the world by a long, long
way.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it has become an upset when Woods does not win a major.
Starting with today's first round, history is waiting:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A victory would give Woods his third major in a row, which
would match Ben Hogan's achievement in 1953, when he won the
Masters, U.S. Open and British Open.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Woods would accomplish the first successful defense of a PGA
Championship since Denny Shute in 1936-1937
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  It would be Woods' fifth career major. His victory in the
British Open completed the career Grand Slam at age 24. It was his
fourth major title in his past five attempts.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  It would be his seventh PGA Tour victory this year, and 12th
in the last 24. He has earned $5,792,821, nearly doubling the take
of Ernie Els, No. 2 on the money list. Els has finished second in
the past three majors.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan's mark commanded the most attention this week, but Woods
contends that it does not enter his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a major championship,'' Woods said. ``It's like
going to the British Open and worrying about completing the Grand
Slam. I'm not here trying to duplicate what Hogan did in '53.
That's strictly a by-product of winning the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere has been the same as the other three majors of
2000. Woods speaks modestly about his chances early in the week,
then jumps out early and runs away. By Sunday, it's an exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to raise our standards to join his,'' Montgomerie
said. ``We can't afford to let him come down to ours. We are all
trying. We are all failing, but we are trying.''
</P>
<P>
   After a layoff, Woods worked on his game last week in the Buick
Open, where he finished 11th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing all right; I broke 80 all four days last week,
which is good for me,'' Woods joked.
</P>
<P>
   Valhalla is a course that sets up well for Woods. It is a
second-shot golf course, with emphasis on high trajectory. After
flattening his swing plane to stay under the expected wind at St.
Andrews, Woods has been working on his high shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it sets up well for anyone who hits the ball high,''
said Woods. ``That's the way Nicklaus golf courses are kind of
designed; you have got to bring the ball in high.''
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting that a victory on Sunday would align Woods with
Hogan. A tunnel-visioned Hogan was obsessed with finding
perfection. Woods, who is more fun-loving, searches for excellence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think there is such a thing as perfection,''
Woods said, ``because we're all human and technically imperfect.
But I've always been a big believer of professional excellence. . .
. I know I can never get to a point where I hit perfect shots every
time. I just want to become the best that I can be. To me, that's
professional excellence.''

REUNIFIED GERMANY STILL FACING DIVISIONS AS ANNIVERSARY NEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DRESDEN, Germany _ Plans for a celebration of the 10th
anniversary of German unity on Oct. 3 have turned into a fiasco
revealing the enduring divisions within the country and the
wretched state of the Christian Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Helmut Kohl, who as chancellor seized the opportunity to unify
the country after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, announced
this week that he would not attend an official celebration in
Dresden, the city that was a center of the dissent that led to the
crumbling of East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The reason he gave was that the occasion should be a ``day of
the people, many of whom courageously took to the street under the
banner `We are one people' and so laid the groundwork for this
miracle.'' At such a moment, he added, ``Personalities should not
take center stage.''
</P>
<P>
   But many ``personalities'' will be in Dresden, including the
French president, Jacques Chirac, and Kohl's absence will leave a
void. Behind his decision lies a festering rancor at his treatment
by the party he dominated for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Since the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the fall of the
Berlin Wall last year, when Kohl took center-stage along with
former presidents George Bush of the United States and Mikhail
Gorbachev of the Soviet Union, the former chancellor has suffered
an astonishing fall from grace. Precipitated by a party financing
scandal, his displacement seems to have left the Christian
Democrats rudderless.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the looming debacle in Dresden, the conservative
Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper said: ``Kohl cannot be filtered
out of the recent history of the `Party of German Unification' if
anything tangible is to be left at all.''
</P>
<P>
   What has been tangible this summer is the personal bitterness
within the party.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Biedenkopf, a veteran Christian Democrat and, as state
premier of Saxony, the organizer of the Dresden event, was
instrumental in engineering the replacement of Kohl as party leader
by Angela Merkel this year.
</P>
<P>
   This has not been forgotten by Kohl, who has refused to comply
with the law by naming donors who provided the Christian Democrats
with more than $1 million in secret payments.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, by turning down Biedenkopf's invitation, the former
chancellor has taken revenge. He has shown how large his shadow
still looms over a party that trails the governing Social Democrats
by nearly 10 percentage points in most opinion polls, and shows
little sign of revival under Merkel.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks now, senior party leaders have been bickering over
whether Biedenkopf insulted Kohl by inviting him to Dresden, but
not inviting him to speak. Merkel has ducked for cover.
</P>
<P>
   Friedhelm Ost, a senior party member, said this sort of
invitation amounted to an ``affront.'' Wolfgang Bosbach, another
leading Christian Democrat, suggested the squabbling was such that
Germans might begin to think that Gerhard Schroeder, the current
chancellor, was ``the father of reunification.''
</P>
<P>
   The arguments have been sharpened by the fact that Lothar de
Maiziere, the last leader of East Germany as it struggled to
sustain itself while abandoning Communist Party rule, has been
invited to speak in Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   In part, this decision reflects the widespread bitterness that
was evident in the east of the country last year when initial
planning for the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the fall of
the Berlin Wall excluded any figures from the former Communist
state. As in many things, east Germans felt excluded.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Joachim Gauck, a former leader of the protests in
the east, was invited to speak and remarked of Germany's difficult
unification that ``we dreamed of paradise and woke up in
North-Rhine Westphalia.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, de Maiziere was high on the guest list from the
beginning. But conservative members of the Christian Democratic
party have been making much of unproven suggestions that he was
long in the pay of the East German state security service, the
Stasi.
</P>
<P>
   Edmond Stoiber, the state premier of Bavaria, said this week
that it was ``incomprehensible'' that de Maiziere be invited to
speak when Kohl had not been. Given that, Stoiber said, he
sympathized with Kohl's decision, although the former chancellor's
place ``should be in Dresden''.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments over de Maiziere have illustrated once again the
difficulties of the Eastern and Western parts of the country in
understanding each other. Unemployment in the East, about 17
percent, is still twice that in the West and a bitter sentiment
persists in many depressed Eastern areas that unification amounted
to a Western takeover in which 17 million East Germans became
second-class citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Biedenkopf, the former chancellor, who will
attend a low-profile celebration organized by a foundation close to
his party in Berlin on Sept. 27, alluded to these problems but
insisted that the ambitions of 1990 had been fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with all the political difficulties and economic burdens
of the first decade of reunification, I still feel great joy at
this event,'' Kohl wrote. ``Today the hopes of a decade ago have
become a reality and `We are one people.'''
</P>
<P>
   One people, but with at least two celebrations. In recent weeks,
the governing Social Democrats have made it clear they will hold
their own commemoration of unification at the World's Fair in
Hanover on Oct. 3, to be attended by Schroeder after he leaves
Dresden.

E-COMMERCE IN LATIN AMERICA HAMPERED BY ERRATIC DELIVERY SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any one of the 500 million people who live in Latin America can
sign on to the Internet, given access to a computer and a phone
line. They can buy a book, CD or anything else offered for sale on
the Internet, given a credit card. And they can have their purchase
delivered to their home or office, given luck.
</P>
<P>
   In many parts of Latin America, postal service outside of major
business centers is erratic at best. At times, the only reliable
national delivery system belongs to the soft-drink and potato chip
manufacturers who stock the bodegas and mom-and-pop stores present
in almost every community, no matter how small or remote.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the cities, packages from abroad can be delayed in
customs for days, and letters arrive weeks late, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   That, to a large extent, leaves the final leg of electronic
commerce in Latin America the province of private services. Each
big city has a few local fast-freight companies, and recently
specialized e-commerce companies like Sky Box Services allow Latin
Americans to have Internet purchases sent to an address in the
United States. Sky Box then carries them south and delivers them to
homes and offices, bypassing often unreliable local carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The most visible deliverers are the large international
companies like United Parcel Service, FedEx and DHL, and all are
expected to play a part in the growth of e-commerce in Latin
America. They have been preparing to handle the new business,
although they do not expect it to boom anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We liken the status of the Internet in Latin America to being
where the United States was in 1996,'' said John Menna, vice
president for marketing for Latin America and the Caribbean for
UPS. ``It'll take about four or five years to start seeing anything
substantial develop there. Nonetheless, UPS is putting in place all
the pieces and the infrastructure to facilitate electronic commerce
and the buying and selling of goods throughout Latin America.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Economic Commission for Latin America and the
Caribbean, the number of computers connected to the Internet last
year rose more rapidly in Latin America than in any other part of
the world. Even so, while the region accounts for 8 percent of the
world's population, it represents just 3.5 percent of Internet
users and less than 1 percent of global e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Many obstacles hamper development of the Internet in Latin
America. Poverty is so persistent that many people still lack
access to a telephone, and the possibility of buying a computer,
let alone logging onto the Internet, is reserved for a relatively
small group of city dwellers with sufficient incomes. Few people
have credit cards, which still are essential for e-commerce to
work. Computer literacy lags far behind levels in other parts of
the world, and telephone service competition has not yet brought
down the cost of Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the issue of delivery. ``Local delivery of
goods is something that many people in Latin America associate with
the local postal service, which in the past has been a very poor
service indeed,'' Menna said.
</P>
<P>
   To strengthen its Latin American operations, UPS is buying
Challenge Air Cargo, an airline that serves Latin America from
Miami. Besides increasing the UPS fleet, the acquisition provides
landing rights in virtually every developed country in Latin
America, a process that could have taken years had it been
negotiated nation by nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Challenge purchase ``clearly says that we think Latin
America is a growing region,'' Menna said. But e-commerce, he
added, ``is still all potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Competition is intense among the air delivery services. DHL
Worldwide Express has spent $30 million the last two years
preparing for more cargo, including substantially more e-commerce
deliveries. In 1998, the company bought three Boeing 727s, upgraded
its hub in Panama City and built a new hub in Buenos Aires. Last
year DHL also acquired DHL SA, a contract operation in Argentina
that was run by a local company. DHL is spending up to $10 million
to improve service in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latin America has an awful lot of people, an awful lot of land
and huge potential,'' said Colum Joyce, an electronic commerce
manager at DHL's headquarters in Brussels. ``But it's no different
from anywhere else in the world. There are a few relatively
concentrated points of consumption, and pickup on the Internet is
concentrating on those socioeconomic segments of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   The other big air delivery service in the region, FedEx, is
building a larger cargo handling operation at Miami International
Airport, the gateway through which most shipments to Latin America
pass. But its real focus is on streamlining the process for getting
goods in and out of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Juan N. Cento, president of FedEx Express International's Latin
America division, said his company was helping customers, like the
hammock manufacturer in Merida, Mexico, he visited recently, design
and build their Web pages to take full advantage of the global
market available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, `Here's what we need,' and we help them with
everything from building a Web page to monitoring the shipping,
tracking and tracing of packages,'' Cento said.
</P>
<P>
   FedEx is also working to reduce customs delays for packages
coming into Latin America. It recently opened a new clearing house
at the Toluca Airport outside Mexico City that enables local
customs agents to clear shipments worth less than $200 on the day
they arrive. A similar system is planned for Campinas, Brazil, near
Sao Paolo, and will later be replicated throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-commerce is an increasingly integral part of the business
environment in certain markets in the region,'' said Gregory M.
Rossiter, a FedEx spokesman. ``But quite candidly, for FedEx, the
potential for e-commerce in the region as a whole is still a number
of years away.''

WITH HOPE FADING, RUSSIA SEEKS NATO AID IN SUBMARINE RESCUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ If any of the crew of a stricken Russian submarine are
still alive, their world has gone pitch black and cold. Moving
about, or even talking, has become perilous _ if any still have the
energy to do it. There may still be food and water, but breathable
air is in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   After five days stranded on the floor of the Barents Sea, this
is the best-case scenario for the 116 Russian officers and crew on
the crippled nuclear submarine, the Kursk, say Russian naval
officers who have survived submarine accidents. This scenario
assumes things nobody knows for sure: that the crew survived
whatever disaster sunk the Kursk last weekend, and that they
managed to escape the forward parts of the vessel that flooded and
to reach undamaged compartments further aft, and that there was
enough air to keep everyone alive until now.
</P>
<P>
   After days of attempts by Russian ships to lower a rescue
capsule to the submarine were frustrated by bad weather and the
precarious angle of the sub, concern for the men on board the Kursk
forced Russia to reverse its earlier refusal of foreign assistance
Wednesday and ask Britain and Norway to help try to save the crew.
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute decision to accept aid from NATO countries _
which was offered when the Russian Navy first disclosed the
accident Monday _ was announced amid the first signs of criticism
here over the way Russian authorities are handling the crisis. One
concern raised by several analysts here is that national pride, or
residual fear of letting their former Cold War adversaries get too
close to their most modern submarine technology, had prevented
Russian authorities from calling for help sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our admirals know too well that disclosing secrets to the West
may easily land them in the clink, while risking sailors lives most
likely will not,'' commented Pavel Felgenhauer, a defense analyst
for The Moscow Times.
</P>
<P>
   And there were fears that the desperate call for assistance,
after officials insisted for days that Western aid was inferior and
was not needed, had come too late for the crew of the Kursk. A
Norwegian ship with a team of deep-sea divers and a British rescue
mini-submarine set out for the site but could take until Saturday
to get there. Naval officials have said the crew's air supply would
run out Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian ships repeatedly attempted to guide rescue capsules
through the stormy waters but, hampered by high seas, strong
underwater currents and poor visibility, could not dock with the
submarine, which is lying at a sharp sidewards tilt on the sea
floor 354 feet beneath the surface.
</P>
<P>
   For the men on board, the 60-degree tilt means that the
machinery and controls that line the crowded compartments are in
unfamiliar places, making it almost impossible to move about, said
reserve Captain Boris Kolyada.
</P>
<P>
   Few people alive can relate to the Kursk crew's ordeal the way
Kolyada can _ he was the executive officer on the Komsomolsk, a
Soviet atomic submarine that sunk off Norway in 1989, killing 42 of
the 69 crew members. One man who can, former Captain Vladimir
Yermolin, who survived a Soviet submarine accident in the early
1970s, said crew members could have trouble concentrating or lose
consciousness from the lack of air.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way to communicate with the outside world, no way
to mark the passage of time, nothing to do but wait to be saved,''
Kolyada said, describing what it is like on a stricken submarine.
``There is a complete loss of orientation. The temperature is
around 40 degrees. There are no warm clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Any emergency batteries for air purification or light would be
dead by now. And according to one report, in the Moscow paper
Kommersant Daily, the Kursk left its emergency batteries on shore
when it set out for exercises last week. The paper, citing naval
sources, said the batteries are a deficit item, and the vessel's
commanders decided they would not need them on what was supposed to
be a three-day trip.
</P>
<P>
   The report, if true, highlights the corner-cutting analysts say
is prevalent in the Navy, where post-Soviet funding cuts have left
most ships unseaworthy and affected even the most modern vessels
like the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin has called for Russia to restore its
armed forces to fighting trim, in part by ordering major exercises
of the kind the Russian submarine fleet has not seen since the end
of the Cold War. But Moscow-based defense analyst Alexander Zhilin
said the Northern Fleet, where the Kursk was based, was poorly
prepared for maneuvers on the high seas, raising the potential for
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue effort has revealed other unflattering details about
the Russian command chain. The daily Segodnya quoted a naval source
as saying that officials did not dare ask NATO for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the president can take the decision to ask NATO for
aid,'' the paper quoted the source as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, on vacation in southern Russia, had been almost invisible
during the crisis until Wednesday, when in a brief television
interview he expressed his concern about the situation but said
rescuers were doing ``everything possible'' to save the crew. Putin
apparently gave the order to ask for foreign help after speaking
with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The British LR5 submarine has the capability to maneuver in
strong currents and attach itself to a tilted vessel, unlike the
modified diving bells Russian rescue ships have been using, which
have to be maneuvered from the surface. It is still unclear if the
British sub can dock with the Russian vessel.
</P>
<P>
   And the roundabout route the British rescue crew is taking _
flying through Norway rather than directly to a Russian base close
to the site of the incident, which will almost ensure the British
will arrive too late _ indicates that the Russians are still not
entirely committed to having the NATO rescuers involved.
</P>
<P>
   The change of heart on foreign assistance was just one of
several reversals, as officials continued to issue streams of
contradictory explanations about what is going on. ``Half of them
don't know what is happening and the half of them that do are
lying,'' said Alexander Nikitin, a former Russian submarine captain
who spent two years in prison for reporting on the hazards caused
by nuclear waste in the Northern Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Navy chief, Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov, said there
had been no communication with the crew since Saturday, but that
this was no real concern and that he was ``more confident'' about
the chances of rescuing the crew. On Tuesday, Kuroyedov had said
that the crew was tapping SOS on the hull of the Kursk, but that
the signal was getting weaker and that this was a grave sign.
</P>
<P>
   The submarine suffered extensive damage after an explosion in
the torpedo compartment at the front of the vessel, but the Navy
has given only sketchy and often contradictory details about what
happened.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy had said it had informed relatives of the crew of the
situation on board the Kursk, but relatives complained to reporters
that naval officials had refused to confirm to them whether their
loved ones were on board.
</P>
<P>
   Felgenhauer said it was impossible to believe anything the Navy
was saying. He cited officials' emphatic denials that the
submarine, which can carry 24 nuclear-tipped anti-ship missiles,
was carrying nuclear weapons when it went down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if that's true,'' he said. ``That's probably
just a guess.''

COMMENTARY: DEFINING AL GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Al Gore has two big problems _ Bill Clinton and Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   He may be able to finesse one of them _ Clinton. But the other
he will have to face head-on.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still don't feel they really know Al Gore, and that's
hurting him,'' said a Democratic delegate, her face a study in
disappointment. ``They think they know Clinton, but Gore comes off
as inauthentic. Only he can change that.''
</P>
<P>
   If you look at the state of the nation, nearly everything is
going the vice president's way. The United States is enjoying the
best economy in its history. The country is at peace. Crime and
unemployment are way down, as are the welfare rolls and rates of
teen pregnancy. The stock market has soared and so has home
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Never before has the American dream been the reality for so
many.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, most voters appear to agree with Gore on most of the
big issues in this year's election, largely supporting his approach
on such matters as health care, Social Security, taxes and the way
to handle the federal budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Polls have shown that a majority of voters also believe Gore is
better prepared to be president than George W. Bush in terms of his
intellectual capacity, command of the issues and experience.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the vice president has trailed Bush in poll after poll,
sometimes by wide margins. And the lack of enthusiasm for Gore from
groups that are traditionally among the Democrats' strongest
supporters, notably blacks and labor unions, is both palpable and
potentially devastating.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton is a problem because the Gore folks both need him
and wish he would go away. The vice president would like to bask in
the sunshine of Clinton's accomplishments, even as he worries about
getting lost in the president's shadow. He also worries about the
dangers of Clinton fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger, tougher problem is Al Gore himself. Interviews
this week with staunch Democrats who are fervent in their desire to
see him become president have shown a deep concern that Gore's
strengths when it comes to issues and experience may be trumped by
the widespread perception that Bush is more likable.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling generally was that Gore's public persona and
communications skills had not markedly improved over the course of
the campaign. There was a hunger among most of the people I talked
with for the vice president to become less guarded and more
spontaneous in his public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kayyem, a Los Angeles venture capitalist, was one of
about 1,400 people who attended a Clinton fund-raiser over the
weekend. When Clinton spoke, he said, ``the other 1,399 people
disappeared and it was as if the president had put his hands on my
shoulders and was talking directly to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often, Gore is just giving you boilerplate,'' Kayyem
added. ``He needs to speak with a certain genuineness of tone,
which has been lacking. And I think he has to take some risks with
his viewpoints and opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   Loren Rothschild, the owner of an investment fund and a
supporter of Gore, agreed that the vice president's personality was
problematic. But he remained optimistic. ``Not everyone can be Bill
Clinton or Franklin Roosevelt or John Kennedy,'' he said. ``But it
seems to me the Democrats have the issues _ on choice, on gun
control, on the economy. And I think when people look at those
issues they'll vote for the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night is Gore's night. With much of the nation watching
_ both critically and expectantly _ he will give his acceptance
speech. It may not be fair to compare him to Clinton, who was
blessed with extraordinary political skills, or to suggest that it
is not enough for Gore to be better prepared and better qualified
than Bush. It was a Democrat, after all, John Kennedy, who liked to
point out that life is not fair.
</P>
<P>
   Leadership is as important as competence in a president. The
American people must be convinced that Al Gore is capable of
defining a vision for the country and then rallying the forces
necessary to realize that vision. And after Bill Clinton, they
especially need a president they know is being straight with them.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore should let it rip Thursday night. The real Al Gore.
Because if a phony shows up at that podium, this election is over.

THERE ARE PARTIES, AND THERE ARE PARTIES FOR THE GODS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM ALLIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES - The unassailable truth about the party circuit out
here is this: anything you can get into probably isn't worth
attending.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the convention lets you know where you stand.
It spotlights the L.A. pecking order that punishes interlopers.
Here, the gods can't stomach the mortals, who in turn detest the
bottom feeders.
</P>
<P>
   As the lowest form of L.A. life, the media can only imagine what
happens in the mists of Hollywood's upper reaches. Titans like Lew
Wasserman and David Geffen hold affairs at their estates so
discreet that they are mentioned third-hand, if at all, in the
press. Everything else is chopped liver.
</P>
<P>
   But we can dream: The soft evening light skips from the
shimmering pool onto the bougainvillea. The ping of primo crystal
echoes off of the sienna stucco. The guests are sleek as seals. The
city, the convention, the dreaded delegates, do not exist. There
are no surprises. Gods hate surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind.
</P>
<P>
   Light years below are the purported A-list bashes, like Barbra's
fundraiser at her Malibu digs Sunday morning for Bill's
presidential library. Details of these affairs are leaked wholesale
because hosts like Barbra want it that way. What good, after all,
is exclusivity if no one knows about it? That's also why reporters
penetrate the lesser parties at wateringholes like Spago for
politicians such as House Minority Leader Dick Gehardt.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the great unwashed get to read more than they want
to know about, say, the West Wing bash Sunday afternoon on the
Warner lot where Clinton failed to join the cast in the faux Oval
Office, or the Mandeville Canyon soiree Saturday night where Cher
sang for the president.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, a convention elevates a politician from snooze to
sizzle. This can happen at the podium or a party. Such a
transformation occurred this week with Vermont Senator Patrick
Leahy, a fine man and solid senator who nonetheless can put the
cows to sleep up in the Vergennes Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Sheryl Crow was to perform at a Leahy tribute
at the Sunset Room, a venue quite a few degrees hotter than
anything in the Green Mountain state. The press became so
interested in the closed event that organizers finally allowed
limited media access before banishing them into the peasoup funk of
the L.A. night.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, the only things deadlier than media parties are
Tupperware klatsches. Exhibit A this week was the party thrown for
reporters Saturday night by Hugh Hefner at the Playboy mansion.
They feigned ennui, badly, until apprised of the fact that the
trophies mingling among them had earned their cottontails as
centerfolds.
</P>
<P>
   Paterfamilias Hefner, meanwhile, appeared with yet another mute
blond and talked to anything that moved for over an hour. Fortified
by the invention of Viagra and the massive press attention, he
radiated the message: What's not to like?
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the media parties that flew too close to the
sun. New York Times L.A. Bureau Chief Todd Purdum and his wife,
former Clinton press secretary DeeDee Myers, hosted an in-house
Times affair at their home Sunday evening that ended up as a
full-blown A-list bash. Beatty, Streisand, Reiner, the West Wing
Cast, all showed up with the welter of media heavies who have been
eyeballing each other all week. Purdum fumed at the volume of
gatecrashers begging for tickets or who materialized on his front
lawn.
</P>
<P>
   The best parties are those that are free of convention cynicism.
High on this list was the pedal-to-the-metal Mardi Gras bash that
Louisiana Senator John Breaux threw on the back lot of the
Paramount Studios Tuesday night, funded by an awesome array of
corporate giants like AT&AMP;T, Bristol-Myers, and Lockheed. (Did I
mention that Breaux sits on the Senate Finance Committee?) This was
an exercise in unadulterated fun.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux, quite simply, was astonishing. He greeted everyone in
the same orange outfit he later wore onstage when he played a
torrid washboard with the Zydeco Twisters. After a costume change,
he emerged atop a giant Mardi Gras float in a white, sequined body
suit, framed by a rainbow of plumes rising from his shoulders into
the sky. Part Elvis, part Liberace, all Cajun, Breaux presented a
spectacle lacking, sadly, among our northern politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``He clearly doesn't have aspirations for higher office,'' noted
one Democrat as Breaux rode by, his eyes wide and his necklace
blinking red and green.

L.A. IS STUCK WITH THE AVENGERS
</HEADLINE>

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're throwing us bones, scraps, scaled-down vestiges of what
we once had in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   They're giving us the Avengers of the Arena Football League, a
team that plays indoors and lines up eight players to a side like
you would see at a Sunday afternoon flag football game at Griffith
Park.
</P>
<P>
   They're giving us a team that will play under the World
Wrestling Federation banner of Vince McMahon in something called
the Xtreme Football League.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams and Raiders have now been gone five years from our
celestial sphere, and we have been reduced to having to accept
street corner handouts as replacements for the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   If someone told me 10 years ago that this would be the case, I'd
have told the person that would be about as likely to happen as,
well, my falling deeply in love with Georgia Frontiere.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that might seem to some to be a more plausible
development since so many people have come to believe that, since I
mention Georgia so often, she has become an object of sublimated
lust, like the little boys in class who pinch the girls they fancy.
</P>
<P>
   Now we're down to waiting until next February 3 when L.A.'s XFL
team will commence its 10-game season that doesn't exactly have
football devotees here hyperventilating in anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   But the general manager of this new enterprise, Mr. John Kenneth
McKay, aka J.K. McKay, son of the legendary USC coach John McKay,
long-time L.A. attorney, former standout receiver for USC, Ed
Roski's legal counsel in the failed attempt to bring an NFL
expansion franchise to L.A., recipient of 29 Pat Haden scoring
passes his senior season at Bishop Amat, insists L.A. will become
enamored with its newest professional football entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a tremendously entertaining brand of
football,'' says McKay, who made it official today that the team's
new coach will be Al Luginbill, former San Diego State head man who
spent the past five years directing the fortunes of the Amsterdam
Admirals. ``There are a couple of rules changes that figure to make
things a little more exciting. There will be no fair catches
allowed on punts, and the ball will be live at all times. And a
player can be in motion towards the line of scrimmage like they do
up in Canada and in the Arena league.''
</P>
<P>
   But the widespread perception of the XFL is that McMahon's
presence--- he's actually in partnership with NBC, which put up
$100 million for the broadcasting rights---will result in the games
being nothing more than scripted acts with the performers spewing
invective at one another and getting into staged brawls.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it's known many of the players will be miked, and
that cameras will be allowed into the dressing rooms, which
certainly can make one slightly suspicious of planned shenanigans
orchestrated by someone so schooled in the art as Vince McMahon.
</P>
<P>
   But J.K. McKay claims that the games in the XFL will be totally
legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way I'd be involved in this league if I thought the games
would be fake,'' he says. ``What's going to be so different about
this league is the presentation. Cameras and microphones are going
to be everywhere. There's going to be total access to both the
media and even the fans. We're going to see to it that a segment of
the fans during games have access to the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very wide-open. It's definitely going to be a
fan- friendly game. And it's going to be inexpensive compared to
the prices in other professional sports. Tickets will go between
twenty-three and twenty-five dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   McKay says 38 players will be carried on an XFL team's game-day
roster, plus an additional seven who will be inactive.
</P>
<P>
   The standard player salary will be $50,000, except for the
quarterbacks, who will be command $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players can make quite a bit more in this league than in any
other except for the NFL,'' says McKay. ``And they can actually
make a lot more since we're going to have an incentive gimmick
built into each game. The players on the winning side each get to
split up $100,000, meaning each will earn an extra $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, if you're fortunate enough to get to the playoffs, the
winning players in the first game will make $10,000 each. And, in
the championship game on April 23, the winning players each will
earn $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you know this league's going to be pretty competitive. The
players on the championship team each can make over $100,000.''
</P>
<P>
   The eight-team league---there also will be franchises in New
York, Chicago, Las Vegas, Orlando, San Jose, Memphis and
Birmingham---will have its games shown on Saturday evenings on NBC
and Sunday evenings on UPN, plus on a yet unnamed cable outlet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have high expectations for this league,'' says the
47-year-old McKay, who played for the Southern California Sun in
1975 in the fledging World Football League when it folded three
quarters of the way through the season. ``The McMahon organization
has shown it knows how to market its product. We've got some
sizable up-front money from the TV networks. We're optimistic. At
least there's going to be professional football back at the
Coliseum.''
</P>
<P>
   True.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect we pro football beggars in Southern California aren't
exactly in a position to be too discriminate.

   As the fall semester looms on the calendar, savvy students have
already studied up on the season's must-haves:
</P>
<P>
   Colors: It's all about autumn brights like red and mustard, but
'70s shades of olive green and earth are in. And the girls still
aren't ready to give up summer's fuchsia and orange.
</P>
<P>
   Prints: Plaid (little checks are big) and python are getting the
best grades, but leopard and zebra are making the grade in small
doses (think accessories like headbands, belts and cell phone
cases).
</P>
<P>
   Leather/pleather: The real thing or the synthetic fake is big
news in basic black or brights. Look for it in snug jeans, skirts
and fitted jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Denim: It's the schoolyard fave, but looks newest in dark
indigo, (sometimes stretchy) and often riding low on the hips. Boot
flares are a must, and so is a matching jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Fleece vests: They add color and warmth and look best with denim
or leather ensembles, worn with a plaid T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Nylon tech pants: The ski-inspired pant that Old Navy introduced
us to last year is still styling, with those rip-away legs that go
from long to short. This semester the pants have even more zippered
pockets for cell phones, pagers and CD players.
</P>
<P>
   V-necks: Hoodies are out and V-necks and classic crew necklines
are back in focus, especially in crocheted sweaters and cotton
T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Accessories: For girls it's hoop earrings, decorative wrist
bands, gradient-tinted aviator glasses (very '70s), lariat
necklaces, stacks of gold bangle bracelets, shoulder duster
earrings (for older teens), and bowling bag purses (that can also
serve as lunch boxes). For the guys, it's clean and simple without
the chains and earrings parents screamed about last year. Cowboy
hats, messenger bags, aviator glasses and electronic gadgets are
the budget breakers, as well as a fold-up scooter that's upstaging
skates and skateboards. &QL;

FALL FASHION TAKES SOME EDUCATED TWISTS AND TURNS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DeWITT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Big kids, little kids, campus trendies and college jocks are all
heading back to school with the same idea of campus cool.
</P>
<P>
   No prissy or preppy ensembles for Fall 2000. Just textbook
classics such as denim jeans and jackets, plus parkas and nylon
tech pants that rip and zip to hold electronic gadgets,
'70s-inspired sweaters, and python pleather/leather print skirts
and pants _ all well-grounded with oversized sneakers or clunky
footwear, according to retailers at numerous fashion outposts.
</P>
<P>
   At the head of the class this year is Robinsons-May, the
department store chain that launched a special in-store boutique
called The Spot this week that's aimed at Generation Y shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion director Milinda Martin says Generation Y (those kids
born between 1979 and 1994) are 60 million strong and reflect the
second-biggest baby boom since 1946. ``According to our demographic
information, the greatest curve is the age group born between 1987
and 1992, so we see this fashion area of continued importance ...
but we're not going to have teen boards like baby boomers may
recall in the '60s at May Company stores. It's a different mindset
today,'' Martin explains, referring to the teens chosen in the '60s
to help with then-fashion events and pictured at the stores.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Spot's best sellers are pants and skirts in pleather
(synthetic leather), particularly in basic black or red, plus
prints and patchwork. ``But the hottest ticket,'' says Martin, ``is
Tommy Hilfiger's patchwork jacket for girls that epitomizes the
'70s retro mood that teens are craving.''
</P>
<P>
   Crocheted sweaters are still going strong, but for the local
climate where fall doesn't start until December, Martin says the
popular choice is a cotton knit top worn sleeveless in offbeat '70s
shades (think mustard and brown), paired with either pleather or
iridescent denim.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to guys' pants, nylon pants upstage denim, Martin
says. ``We call it the California convertible, because the pants
can be converted to shorts with a rip or zip, and they're being
topped with camp shirts in plaid, or tropical camp prints worn open
over T-shirts. The must-have labels? It's L.A. companies such as
Guess? and Quiksilver, but Ralph Lauren's Polo and Tommy Hilfiger
are still carrying clout with the over-12 crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Op, a California lifestyle company that has its own Web site and
online store, has also zeroed in on Generation Y and its love of
skateboarding, cell-confabs and vintage looks. ``Op's new fall
collection,'' says design director Nat Norfleet, ``is big on
retro/floral/rayon camp shirts, quilted zip-front vests and nylon
blend full-zip snowboard style jackets with neo-retro striping,
flap pockets and embroidered logos for the boys, while girls prefer
feminity and function in bright blues, red, yellows, with hip,
low-waist nylon trail pants and boat-or V-neck tops, worn with
micro-fiber skorts.''
</P>
<P>
   Having trouble translating? Think of basic parkas with extras
(bells and whistles), miniskirts with built-in shorts, last year's
cargo pocket pants, with traditional corduroy pants and plaid
shirts for the under-12 lunch- bunch brigade.
</P>
<P>
   Denim _ plain, coated, embroidered or cut into overalls _ is
still a staple of the back-to-school wardrobe. Says Mervyn's
spokeswoman Kate Rice, ``The big trend is dark denim, whether it's
a zip-off style for boys or embellished boot-cut jeans for girls.
And both are wearing dark denim jackets with front-slash pockets
and contrast stitching over fleece pullovers and basic crew or
V-neck T-shirts.'' The vest-and-tee-combo, reports Rice, is also a
favorite in warmer regions, as the layers can be removed as the day
warms up.
</P>
<P>
   At JC Penney stores, denim is still soft and faded, often in a
baggy stonewashed fabric, with carpenter details in the guys'
department, while girls are going for denim that's got enough
stretch to flaunt curves and a flare at the hemline to show off
clunky high-heeled boots.
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hugger jeans, jeans cut above the ankle or just below the
knee, jeans in khaki or deep indigo continue to be strong looks in
the denim department, reports Norman Karr, spokesman for the
nationwide Jeanswear Communications newsletter, but the big news is
jeans with pockets to carry cell phones, beepers and the
all-important personal CD player. And when it comes to the
new-again denim jacket, Karr says it's the sleeveless style and the
longer, belted jean jacket that have the most edge.
</P>
<P>
   The fabric of the wild, wild west is also the big seller at
Target stores, says spokeswoman Melissa Sheets. Target calls its
back-to-school fashion stance ``alternative west,'' and Sheets
describes it as a classic cowboy-inspired look in dark nonstretch
denim jeans and jackets worn with cowboy hats. ``There's a twist,
though, with girls sporting hats accented with fuchsia trim and
bare tie-back tank tops under the jackets, while guys are wearing
those '50s plaid shirts with the pearlized snaps down the front.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other retailers, Target has also stocked up on nylon
ski-wear looks, including micro-fleece vests which are turning out
to be a colorful must-have for all ages, fine-gauge sweaters and
fitted black leather jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Although leopard and zebra prints are looking sooo last year,
several stores including Target are showing the furry fabric in
younger girls' accessories such as headbands, wrist bands and
watches, backpacks and even cell phone totes.
</P>
<P>
   With three-digit temperatures still soaring in the Southland,
most students are still wearing sandals, but come September the
school yard favorite remains ripple-soled sneakers. Skechers, Nike
and Vans are among the status labels. Fresher looks include
chunky-heeled boots (ankle or knee-high) for girls and lug-soled
suede oxfords for boys.
</P>
<P>
   As some schools eliminate lockers, many students are literally
booking (or biking) it back to school with hikers' backpacks and
backpacks on wheels that look like plane luggage. Brands such as
JanSport, Nike and Adidas are the big names among fans, but
trendies are trying other brands and styles, including Op's new
flap-pocket messenger bag, roomy enough for a calculator-clipboard
combo or lap top, or they're cramming their stuff into those hip
bowling bag totes available at junior fashion boutiques. &QL;

EX-CAMBRIDGE TECHNOLOGY CEO ALLOWED TO KEEP NEW JOB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Gen3 Partners is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A judge refused Wednesday to force James K. Sims,
former chief executive of Cambridge Technology Partners Inc., from
his post at a new start-up.
</P>
<P>
   But Sims won a split decision in Superior Court. While he can
keep his job, seven of his employees have been restrained from
recruiting Cambridge Technology workers.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling inflamed an already tense struggle that Cambridge
Technology claims has contributed to a deluge of employee
departures. Sims, who was ousted from the company last year, sees
the lawsuit as a personal attack and has countersued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm insulted they went after me,'' Sims said. ``I plan to
absolutely destroy them in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge Technology sued Sims in April, saying he had broken
his promise not to become a rival. Last month, the technology
consulting firm filed a request for a preliminary injunction,
seeking to prevent Sims and another former Cambridge Technology
executive from working at Gen3 Partners Inc. of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Cambridge Technology argued that Sims and Arthur
Toscanini, a former Cambridge chief financial officer who now works
for Sims, had violated their noncompete contracts.
</P>
<P>
   But in her ruling, Judge Leila Kern wrote that the consultant
had not yet proven that the two executives and Gen3 Partners had
become rivals of Cambridge Technology.
</P>
<P>
   After analyzing the large consultant's Digital Strategy Practice
and Gen3's offerings, Kern wrote: ``It is equally probable as not
that these two companies are competing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge Technology also claimed that Gen3 Partners had wooed
Wal-Mart.com, one of its big clients. In an affidavit, Sims
acknowledged that his company had sought the retailer's business
but later discovered that Wal-Mart
</P>
<P>
   .com was looking for work that Gen3 Partners did not perform.
</P>
<P>
   Kern also noted that, in an Aug. 7 article in The Boston Globe,
Wal-Mart said it was unhappy with the Web site and was no longer
working with Cambridge Technology. In fact, Wal-Mart.com has turned
to Sapient Corp., a technology consultant in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Gen3 Partners, however, did not win in other areas. Kern issued
a preliminary injunction against Toscanini and six other former
Cambridge Technology employees, restraining them from recruiting
the consultant's workers. That means they will not be able to
recruit from their former employer for two years after their
departures from Cambridge Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Absent from that list, however, is Sims. The animated and brash
executive apparently never signed a nonsolicitation agreement at
Cambridge Technology, which means he can continue to recruit from
his ex-employer _ at least for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   Following Wednesday's ruling, both companies claimed they had
triumphed in the first leg of their court battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision by the court is an important one for Cambridge
that vindicates our company's right to enforce our agreements and
protect our work force from unlawful raiding,'' Joseph LaSala, an
attorney for Cambridge Technology, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Sims said he had prevailed in a
personal attack against him. ``It was really terrible what they
tried to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Cambridge Technology said it had settled a
lawsuit with a start-up founded by Harold Gubnitsky, a former vice
president. Gubnitsky's company, Semtor Inc. of Fort Lauderdale,
Fla., has agreed not to hire any more Cambridge Technology
employees.
</P>
<P>
   But the feud between Cambridge Technology and Sims seems far
from over.
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge Technlogy has no plans to drop its lawsuit against
Sims and Gen3 Partners. Likewise, Sims does not intend to drop his
suit against Cambridge, in which he may ask for up to $10 million
in damages.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, competitors have watched the court case with
amusement. But several analysts say the disputes are distracting
Cambridge Technology at a time when it should be working to stem
recent losses, retain employees, and boost its stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Cambridge Technology have spiraled downward from a
52-week high of $27 on Dec. 30. The company's stock price rose
43.75 cents Wednesday on the Nasdaq Stock Market to close at
$7.9375.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamentally, what Cambridge Technology Partners has to do is
worry about Cambridge Technology Partners,'' said Rob DeSisto, a
vice president at Gartner Group in Lowell.

   So far, the Spot's best sellers are pants and skirts in pleather
(synthetic leather), particularly in basic black or red, plus
prints and patchwork. ``But the hottest ticket,'' says Martin, ``is
Tommy Hilfiger's patchwork jacket for girls that epitomizes the
'70s retro mood that teens are craving.''
</P>
<P>
   Crocheted sweaters are still going strong, but for the local
climate where fall doesn't start until December, Martin says the
popular choice is a cotton knit top worn sleeveless in offbeat '70s
shades (think mustard and brown), paired with either pleather or
iridescent denim.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to guys' pants, nylon pants upstage denim, Martin
says. ``We call it the California convertible, because the pants
can be converted to shorts with a rip or zip, and they're being
topped with camp shirts in plaid, or tropical camp prints worn open
over T-shirts. The must-have labels? It's L.A. companies such as
Guess? and Quiksilver, but Ralph Lauren's Polo and Tommy Hilfiger
are still carrying clout with the over-12 crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Op, a California lifestyle company that has its own Web site and
online store, has also zeroed in on Generation Y and its love of
skateboarding, cell-confabs and vintage looks. ``Op's new fall
collection,'' says design director Nat Norfleet, ``is big on
retro/floral/rayon camp shirts, quilted zip-front vests and nylon
blend full-zip snowboard style jackets with neo-retro striping,
flap pockets and embroidered logos for the boys, while girls prefer
feminity and function in bright blues, red, yellows, with hip,
low-waist nylon trail pants and boat-or V-neck tops, worn with
micro-fiber skorts.''
</P>
<P>
   Having trouble translating? Think of basic parkas with extras
(bells and whistles), miniskirts with built-in shorts, last year's
cargo pocket pants, with traditional corduroy pants and plaid
shirts for the under-12 lunch- bunch brigade.
</P>
<P>
   Denim _ plain, coated, embroidered or cut into overalls _ is
still a staple of the back-to-school wardrobe. Says Mervyn's
spokeswoman Kate Rice, ``The big trend is dark denim, whether it's
a zip-off style for boys or embellished boot-cut jeans for girls.
And both are wearing dark denim jackets with front-slash pockets
and contrast stitching over fleece pullovers and basic crew or
V-neck T-shirts.'' The vest-and-tee-combo, reports Rice, is also a
favorite in warmer regions, as the layers can be removed as the day
warms up.
</P>
<P>
   At JC Penney stores, denim is still soft and faded, often in a
baggy stonewashed fabric, with carpenter details in the guys'
department, while girls are going for denim that's got enough
stretch to flaunt curves and a flare at the hemline to show off
clunky high-heeled boots.
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hugger jeans, jeans cut above the ankle or just below the
knee, jeans in khaki or deep indigo continue to be strong looks in
the denim department, reports Norman Karr, spokesman for the
nationwide Jeanswear Communications newsletter, but the big news is
jeans with pockets to carry cell phones, beepers and the
all-important personal CD player. And when it comes to the
new-again denim jacket, Karr says it's the sleeveless style and the
longer, belted jean jacket that have the most edge.
</P>
<P>
   The fabric of the wild, wild west is also the big seller at
Target stores, says spokeswoman Melissa Sheets. Target calls its
back-to-school fashion stance ``alternative west,'' and Sheets
describes it as a classic cowboy-inspired look in dark nonstretch
denim jeans and jackets worn with cowboy hats. ``There's a twist,
though, with girls sporting hats accented with fuchsia trim and
bare tie-back tank tops under the jackets, while guys are wearing
those '50s plaid shirts with the pearlized snaps down the front.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other retailers, Target has also stocked up on nylon
ski-wear looks, including micro-fleece vests which are turning out
to be a colorful must-have for all ages, fine-gauge sweaters and
fitted black leather jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Although leopard and zebra prints are looking sooo last year,
several stores including Target are showing the furry fabric in
younger girls' accessories such as headbands, wrist bands and
watches, backpacks and even cell phone totes.
</P>
<P>
   With three-digit temperatures still soaring in the Southland,
most students are still wearing sandals, but come September the
school yard favorite remains ripple-soled sneakers. Skechers, Nike
and Vans are among the status labels. Fresher looks include
chunky-heeled boots (ankle or knee-high) for girls and lug-soled
suede oxfords for boys.
</P>
<P>
   As some schools eliminate lockers, many students are literally
booking (or biking) it back to school with hikers' backpacks and
backpacks on wheels that look like plane luggage. Brands such as
JanSport, Nike and Adidas are the big names among fans, but
trendies are trying other brands and styles, including Op's new
flap-pocket messenger bag, roomy enough for a calculator-clipboard
combo or lap top, or they're cramming their stuff into those hip
bowling bag totes available at junior fashion boutiques. &QL;

<P>
   Many of the nation's biggest law firms _ inundated with more
business than they can often handle and pressing lawyers to raise
their billable hours to pay escalating salaries _ have cut back on
pro bono work so sharply that they fall far below professional
guidelines for representing people who cannot afford to pay.
</P>
<P>
   The roughly 50,000 lawyers at the nation's 100 highest-grossing
firms spent an average of just eight minutes a day on pro bono
cases in 1999, according to a survey last month by American Lawyer
magazine. That comes out to about 36 hours a year, down
significantly from 56 hours in 1992, when the magazine started
tracking firms' volunteer hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phenomenon of being so busy that you don't have as much
time for pro bono work is quite real,'' said Jack Londen, a partner
at Morrison &AMP; Forrester. The San Francisco firm has a long
tradition of taking charitable cases, but since the recession of
the early 1990s, its lawyers have cut their average pro bono hours
in half, the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there is more work than lawyers to do it, and there are
not enough new lawyers out there to hire, the pro bono gets
shelved,'' Londen said.
</P>
<P>
   The decline is troubling for many in the legal profession, both
because of deep financial cuts in government-sponsored legal aid
programs and because the American Bar Association urges lawyers to
do at least 50 hours of pro bono work each year. Only 18 of the 100
firms surveyed reported that their lawyers averaged that many hours
or more in 1999, less than half the number seven years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But with the economy booming, firms are enjoying record profits,
the American Lawyer survey found.
</P>
<P>
   Even in cities with strong pro bono legacies, where public
service is a particular point of pride, the trend has emerged,
sparking concern that a cultural shift may be under way. In
February, a committee of the District of Columbia circuit court
conducted a survey of 142 private law firms in Washington, a center
of pro bono activity. Less than 25 percent of their lawyers spent
50 hours or more representing clients who could not pay, it found.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing is a sea change, rather than just a rogue
wave,'' said Eugene R. Fidell, head of an advisory committee of the
U.S. District Court in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Since many large firms raised starting pay for new associates by
as much as $25,000 this year, hoping to dissuade them from flocking
to Internet start-ups with stock options, many worry that the ebb
in pro bono work will only accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're under pressure to work hard to pay for these rising
salaries,'' said John Payton, a partner at Wilmer, Cutler &AMP;
Pickering who is also president-elect of the Bar Association of
Washington. ``I don't think it's going to wipe out the tradition of
pro bono, but it's clearly going to have some impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Hoffman, the partner in charge of doling out pro bono
assignments at Crowell &AMP; Moring, has taken to cornering lawyers in
hallways at the large Washington firm. Her e-mail pleas go
unanswered, memos no longer work and phone calls _ once so
effective _ now leave her colleagues unmoved, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's somebody out here who has time to do it,''
Hoffman said. ``I just have to find that person.''
</P>
<P>
   The drop-off in pro bono work comes when the legal community can
least afford it, many public interest groups say. Since 1996, the
Legal Services Corp., a major source of representation for
low-income people in noncriminal cases, has lost a quarter of its
financing from the federal government _ the source of the bulk of
its budget _ leading to hundreds of layoffs among its legal staff
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1996, Congress prohibited lawyers who get legal-services
money from engaging in class-action lawsuits of any kind, or taking
cases on a number of issues, including abortion, illegal
immigration and welfare revision. To fill the gap, many say private
firms need to increase their volunteer efforts, not retreat from
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a sustained level of pro bono, a lot of people who
need legal advice, or who need their rights protected, are not
going to have the same access to justice as they would otherwise,''
said Robert Weiner, the pro bono chairman of the American Bar
Association.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As practices shy away from pro bono work, many civil-rights
lawyers say it is becoming increasingly difficult to find
volunteers for cases that would have elicited quick responses years
ago. Hilary Chiz, the executive director of the American Civil
Liberties Union in West Virginia, says she searched for a law firm
to represent students who were told to pray in school but had no
takers after a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hot issue, it's sexy, it's First Amendment,'' she said.
``I would have thought it would have been easy to place.`
</P>
<P>
   Vera E. Kennedy, 55, is also frustrated by the lack of free
legal representation. Kennedy's apartment is among about 270
households in Hunter's View, a San Francisco public housing
development that the city wants to demolish and rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   When similar buildings were torn down a few years ago, prominent
firms stepped forward to make sure residents got adequate interim
housing and would be allowed to move back when the work was
finished. Local public interest lawyers have been scrambling for
months to find a firm to do the same for Kennedy and her fellow
tenants, but have had no luck so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are mothers with young children here,'' said Kennedy.
``They need the protection of having a place to live.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, civil-rights lawyers, advocates and poor people
themselves have long lamented the difficulty finding lawyers with
the imposing resources often needed to bring forward big lawsuits.
A 1993 study by the American Bar Association showed that less than
30 percent of low-income people who needed a lawyer for a civil
matter actually got one _ proof that, even at its best,
volunteerism may not solve the legal difficulties of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a problem that was bad in 1993 is only going to be
exacerbated by the fact that you have fewer lawyers doing pro
bono,'' said Deputy Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr., who has
been directed by President Clinton to monitor and promote pro bono
work in minority communities.

<P>
   Millions of fans will trip over each other and spend top dollar
to get a chance to see Barbra Streisand, who will bring down the
curtain on her concert career after September dates at Staples
Center and Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   But what marquee name lures the reclusive
singer/actress/director out of her Malibu digs?
</P>
<P>
   Why her man Bill, of course.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday from a Staples Center skybox, Streisand was spotted
cheering on President Clinton during his speech before the
Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   A staunch liberal Democrat, money raiser and card-carrying
member of the ``cultural elite,'' dubbed the most powerful woman in
Hollywood, the 58-year-old Streisand has been active in politics
since she was a teen. At 19, she sang for President Kennedy, and
for President Johnson five years later. Streisand, who was active
in George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign, was one of the few
celebrities to appear on President Richard Nixon's so-called
``enemies list.''
</P>
<P>
   And Streisand is doing more than cheering this week. Tonight,
after Al Gore gives his acceptance speech, she may well steal the
spotlight from the candidate when she appears at a $1,000-a-ticket
Democratic National Committee fund-raiser at the Shrine Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Senator Blanche Lambert Lincoln of Arkansas says that
``there is no doubt that the high visibility of people like that
(referring to Streisand) do a lot for the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Bergman, president of music rights organization ASCAP
and co-writer of Streisand's 1973 No. 1 hit, ``The Way We Were,''
says Streisand's value to the DNC is ``self-evident.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Streisand opened her secluded hill-top Malibu estate
for a brunch to allow President Clinton to drum up cash to fund his
$125 million presidential library and museum in Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   The White House refused to give details about the event for 50
couples or reveal the guest list, but some reports estimated that
Clinton could have raised as much as $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats also value Streisand's value as a spokesperson and
a symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average person pays about that much attention to
politics,'' says Lincoln, snapping her fingers, ``and she brings
that much more attention to it. So I'm very grateful that she'll
step out and say these issues are important to her, and that's not
easy.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman says Streisand's involvement in politics shows ``there
are issues she cares about very deeply and like any responsible
citizen, she wants to speak out. And she speaks quite eloquently
with both her words and talent as an actress, singer and
filmmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty Thomas, actress and director of ``The Brady Bunch Movie,'
echoed those sentiments. ``For me _ being part of the Democratic
Party _ what you dream of is having a passionate, articulate
spokesman (like Streisand). ... She's great. I applaud her every
time she does it (stands up for her beliefs). And for her to
perform, too, that's what you dream of (when putting together a
fund-raiser).''
</P>
<P>
   But Streisand doesn't get a standing ovation with all Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important we have people committed to the Democratic
agenda (like Streisand),'' said U.S. Rep. Cal Dooley, who
represents much of California's Central Valley and is a leader of
the centrist-minded New Democrats. But because Streisand is
committed to a liberal agenda, ``she has not helped us'' in pushing
the party toward the middle, Dooley said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's event wasn't the first time Streisand has opened her
home for political causes. Prior to the 1986 elections, Streisand
performed for 500 invited guests in her own backyard, raising
enough money to help elect five Democratic senators, thus restoring
a Democratic majority in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   She headlined concerts which raised millions for each of
Clinton's presidential campaigns and sang at his inaugural concert.
</P>
<P>
   Streisand was one of Hollywood's most outspoken defenders of the
President during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, stating that the
Republicans were using the impeachment issue as a means of
unraveling the achievements of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Streisand's commitment to Clinton extended to a personal nature.
She became friends and maintained a relationship the president's
mother, Virginia Kelley, until her death of breast cancer in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's post-convention event is an event because it will be
one of Streisand's final performances before she stops doing
concerts. (She will appear Sept. 20-21 at Staples Center and Sept.
27-28 in New York.)
</P>
<P>
   After receiving the Hollywood Foreign Press Association's Cecil
B. DeMille Award at the 57th annual Golden Globe Awards in January,
she told journalists that she didn't ``enjoy public performances
and being up on a stage. ... I like to be behind the camera or in a
recording studio.''
</P>
<P>
   While she is calling a halt to live shows, Streisand has no
plans to stop singing. A new disc, ``Timeless: Live in Concert,''
is due in stores Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the Democrats clearly scored this year in the
entertainment department, especially compared to the Republicans,
who at their convention were serenaded by Hank Williams Jr., Chubby
Checker, the Temptations, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire, a
lineup apparently enjoying a day pass from the State Fair circuit.
</P>
<P>
   The Shrine event also features Kenneth ``Babyface'' Edmonds,
Boyz II Men and Gladys Knight. Whoopi Goldberg hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Although many believe Streisand is quitting her concert career
due to her decades-old stage-fright, some reports suggest she and
husband James Brolin plan to adopt a baby girl. Streisand, who has
a 33-year-old son from a previous marriage, wed Brolin, 60, two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather travel,'' she said in January. ``We just like to
get in the car and go, stopping at motels and truck stops. We're
normal people. We like simple pleasures.''

 UNDATED: minority communities. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not that the big firms do all the unpaid work. Small practices
and one-lawyer offices take on the bulk of pro bono cases, though
their volunteer hours often go uncounted. Many of these lawyers
continue to take on a wealth of unpaid assignments, even though
they are busy too, given recent surges in employment, disability
and sexual harassment litigation. But in some rural areas, where
small law offices often comprise the entire legal community, many
firms have become as preoccupied as have their larger counterparts
in bustling cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't say yes to everybody,'' said Angele Court, pro bono
coordinator for Vermont's legal services program. ``So they say no
to the more difficult case.''
</P>
<P>
   Representing the poor is an integral part of being a lawyer,
ingrained in the profession since its origins in ancient Rome, when
lawyers began practicing for political prestige, not money. In the
United States, the commitment to pro bono work is codified in the
code of ethics that has governed the profession for nearly a
century. For many, the leadership of corporate firms is critical
for setting the tone that pro bono work is still more a
responsibility than an act of charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big law firms provide the litmus test for the legal
community,'' said Steven B. Scudder, counsel to American Bar
Association's standing committee on public service.
</P>
<P>
   Most firms say it is not their commitment that has waned, just
their ability to take on as many cases as they have in the past.
While lawyers typically billed 1,700 hours annually just a few
years ago, today they routinely bill 2,200 to 2,300 hours, said
Esther F. Lardent, director of the Pro Bono Institute at the
Georgetown University Law Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're working at rates that were just unthinkable 10 years
ago,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The rush of new business has also meant rapid growth within
firms, sometimes by as much as 40 percent a year. Practices have
sprouted new offices around the country, often in cities where the
firms have few community ties. The lawyers hired to staff them are
so frantically managing busy practices that it will take time
before they can branch out and take pro bono cases, firms say.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not as if lawyers are turning their backs on the poor.
With more than 150,000 lawyers at their disposal, the top 500 firms
still set aside millions of pro bono hours each year, according to
the Pro Bono Institute. Some firms are donating more money than
ever to legal services organizations to compensate for their
declining hours, while 21 of the top 100 firms have stepped up
their volunteer efforts, or at least kept them from dwindling.
</P>
<P>
   Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &AMP; Flom, which in 1999 became the
first law firm to gross more than $1 billion in a year, now flies
new associates to its headquarters in New York for a pro bono pep
talk, gives public-service awards to high achievers and has
expanded its placement of lawyers in community organizations for
several months at a time. But the firm only began these initiatives
after its pro bono hours started to slip in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a horrible downturn, but it was enough of one,''
said Ronald J. Tabak, the firm's pro bono coordinator. In the
current climate, Tabak added, keeping pro bono hours up takes a
concerted effort, since the demands of paying clients alone occupy
far more than a 40-hour workweek and the competition for new
lawyers, from recent graduates to veterans, has greatly
intensified.
</P>
<P>
   To pay for rising salaries, most firms have raised the minimum
number of hours lawyers are expected to bill clients, yet often do
not count their pro bono work in the totals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to be in a position where the associates would
decide between doing their fee paying work or not,'' said R. Bruce
McLean, chairman of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP; Field in
Washington. Last year, the firm decided not to credit pro bono time
until lawyers billed at least 2,000 hours in a given year.
</P>
<P>
   Some worry that such changes may have a chilling effect on
lawyers' willingness to take pro bono cases. Michael Harris,
assistant director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights of
the San Francisco Bay Area, says that lawyers who would otherwise
take cases are unusually tentative this year, waiting to see how
pro bono hours will be treated come bonus time. The cases they do
take, he says, tend to be short and easy to wrap up, lest they get
stuck with long-term commitments that may end up counting against
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in this period of transition and uncertainty,'' said
Harris. ``If the people who did pro bono work get rewarded at the
end of the year, the people who have been standing on the sidelines
will come back.''
</P>
<P>
   But even when volunteer hours are, in theory, given equal
weight, some associates feel that their careers will be better
served by concentrating on paying clients and steering new business
to the firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long race going up the partnership track,'' said Randi
L. Strudler, a partner with Jones, Day, Reavis &AMP; Pogue in New York.
``Rightly or wrongly, not everyone values pro bono work the same as
client work.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Clinton made a call to action last year, asking lawyers to
step up their volunteer service, a number of new initiatives have
been created to stimulate a pro bono renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   One of the leading efforts, called Lawyers for One America, is
composed of corporate law firms, law schools and bar associations
nationwide. The group, based in San Francisco, seeks to draw from
the growing ranks of business lawyers _ the largest segment of many
large firms, particularly in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Because many corporate lawyers focus solely on transactions and
never go to court, they often feel out of place handling the
mainstays of pro bono work _ divorces, tenant-landlord disputes or
social security cases. Officials at Lawyers for One America and
other public interest groups hope to soften that discomfort by
matching business lawyers with low-income people looking to start
companies of their own.
</P>
<P>
   But they say the concept is only just starting to take root at
firms, and some question whether the standing of pro bono work has
diminished.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dollars are so astronomical that they're blinding people
to public service,'' said Teveia R. Barnes, the group's executive
director. ``It does a disservice to the legal profession and our
reputation.'' &QL;

   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ It wasn't that long ago when the Cowboys
were winning world championships the old-fashioned NFL way, and the
historians will remember it as the end of an era. Kinda like when
Chubby Checker stopped twisting.
</P>
<P>
   The last decade started for the Cowboys this way:
</P>
<P>
   They evaluated talent, then drafted it or traded for it, then
developed it, then paid that talent a minimal going rate, then
stood back and watched Jerry and Jimmy hug each other and the
Lombardi Trophy on national TV.
</P>
<P>
   Who cared about any salary cap?
</P>
<P>
   Today, of course, just four seasons since the Cowboys' last 1995
Super Bowl team, the entire league is consumed with just that _ the
salary cap. It doesn't necessarily matter who's got the best
talent, best coach or best owner, survival from one season to the
next depends largely on which teams manage to remain ``cap
friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Bean-counters and pencil-necked geeks in the front office are
just as likely to win you a Super Bowl as the stud quarterback
sitting there in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   It says here the NFL salary cap, which came to pass in 1994, has
destroyed the league as we once knew it by cheapening the product
on the field dramatically. So there.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jones, once dubbed ``Cap Daddy'' for his role in pushing
for approval among fellow owners, had a reply to that opinion here
yesterday, but first there's also this:
</P>
<P>
   Major-league baseball owners would immediately sell their souls
to the devil or Michael Irvin if they could copy-cat the football
salary cap. This system is viewed in baseball, at least by
ownership, as Utopia, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Jones: ``If a vote on the salary cap was being held today, and
my voting interest strictly involved the Dallas Cowboys, then I'd
give them a big no. But because the Cowboys can't stand alone, my
vote would have to reflect what is best for the league. In that
regard, I'd stay with the system we have in place. It is best for
all, even though the cap has done damage to the Cowboys.''
</P>
<P>
   Much damage, actually. But Jones is an owner, and any
executive-level type in any business wants his employee salary
expense to be defined. The cap allows that in football. In
baseball, the players' payroll can consume 75 percent, or more, of
the budget.
</P>
<P>
   And just as important, the NFL salary cap allows the owners to
police themselves on spending to win.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of winning, the Cowboys had the dynasty working in the
first half of '90s. The pre-cap haul was three Super Bowls in four
seasons. Starting in 1996, however, this team has won one playoff
game. Overall, the league is weaker, so what does that say about
the post-cap Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had more players to lose, because we were a young team with
so much talent _ under the cap, we did lose more than other
teams,'' said Stephen Jones, the No. 1 cap man for his father. And
by the way, there's no geek in Stephen. He's a former college
football player. But his front- office job is as difficult, if not
more so, than that of Dave Campo.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Jerry admits he miscalculated one important area when the
salary cap was implemented in '94. ``Financially, it appeared the
sounder way to go, and football-wise, I was confident we could
continue to compete for a long time because of the way the cap
rules were defined,'' Jones said. ``It was going to be a hard cap.
Every team would be limited in what they could do with the money.
And we already had the best talent.''
</P>
<P>
   But out in San Francisco, Carmen Policy uncovered a loophole. By
extending existing contracts, extra cap money could be generated.
The war was suddenly on between Jones and Policy, who ran the
strongest teams of the mid-'90s. Jones, of course, discovered
loopholes of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hard cap suddenly became a soft cap,'' Jones said. ``We
could buy on credit. We could use future money. It all became a
huge mistake. It certainly hurt the Cowboys.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, we know the Policy plan chased the 49ers off a
football cliff. That franchise was destroyed by salary cap
mistakes. Currently, Jacksonville is also in trouble. Then there
are the Washington Redskins, who appear to be the cap-disaster of
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   To the credit of Jerry and Stephen, the Cowboys at least remain
competitive, despite constant cap squeezes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guesswork is involved at times, and so is luck,'' Jerry said.
``What has prevented us from falling into a mess like San Francisco
is being able to estimate and evaluate where we can move money
around. You need to stay aggressive. You also need to be very
careful. It's a juggling act. So far, we're OK. But the squeeze is
tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Cowboys faced a potential cap crisis, but
Jones worked around that. Next year, due to the way contracts are
structured, will be another test. ``But frankly, I'm confident we
will have a handle on what's coming \Rin 2001\S, and also win again
under a salary cap system,'' Stephen Jones said. ``People ask me
when the big note is finally going to come due on us. But if we
continue to do our job on the cap, that note won't ever have to be
paid in full.''
</P>
<P>
   Football in the NFL has given way to this cap crud. The game
suffers, the owners make money, and baseball looks on with a
massive amount of envy.

<P>
   Millions of fans will trip over each other and spend top dollar
to get a chance to see Barbra Streisand, who will bring down the
curtain on her concert career after September dates at Staples
Center and Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   But what marquee name lures the reclusive
singer/actress/director out of her Malibu digs?
</P>
<P>
   Why her man Bill, of course.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday from a Staples Center skybox, Streisand was spotted
cheering on President Clinton during his speech before the
Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   A staunch liberal Democrat, money raiser and card-carrying
member of the ``cultural elite,'' dubbed the most powerful woman in
Hollywood, the 58-year-old Streisand has been active in politics
since she was a teen. At 19, she sang for President Kennedy, and
for President Johnson five years later. Streisand, who was active
in George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign, was one of the few
celebrities to appear on President Richard Nixon's so-called
``enemies list.''
</P>
<P>
   And Streisand is doing more than cheering this week. Tonight,
after Al Gore gives his acceptance speech, she may well steal the
spotlight from the candidate when she appears at a $1,000-a-ticket
Democratic National Committee fund-raiser at the Shrine Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Senator Blanche Lambert Lincoln of Arkansas says that
``there is no doubt that the high visibility of people like that
(referring to Streisand) do a lot for the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Bergman, president of music rights organization ASCAP
and co-writer of Streisand's 1973 No. 1 hit, ``The Way We Were,''
says Streisand's value to the DNC is ``self-evident.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Streisand opened her secluded hill-top Malibu estate
for a brunch to allow President Clinton to drum up cash to fund his
$125 million presidential library and museum in Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   The White House refused to give details about the event for 50
couples or reveal the guest list, but some reports estimated that
Clinton could have raised as much as $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats also value Streisand's value as a spokesperson and
a symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average person pays about that much attention to
politics,'' says Lincoln, snapping her fingers, ``and she brings
that much more attention to it. So I'm very grateful that she'll
step out and say these issues are important to her, and that's not
easy.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman says Streisand's involvement in politics shows ``there
are issues she cares about very deeply and like any responsible
citizen, she wants to speak out. And she speaks quite eloquently
with both her words and talent as an actress, singer and
filmmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty Thomas, actress and director of ``The Brady Bunch Movie,'
echoed those sentiments. ``For me _ being part of the Democratic
Party _ what you dream of is having a passionate, articulate
spokesman (like Streisand). ... She's great. I applaud her every
time she does it (stands up for her beliefs). And for her to
perform, too, that's what you dream of (when putting together a
fund-raiser).''
</P>
<P>
   But Streisand doesn't get a standing ovation with all Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important we have people committed to the Democratic
agenda (like Streisand),'' said U.S. Rep. Cal Dooley, who
represents much of California's Central Valley and is a leader of
the centrist-minded New Democrats. But because Streisand is
committed to a liberal agenda, ``she has not helped us'' in pushing
the party toward the middle, Dooley said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's event wasn't the first time Streisand has opened her
home for political causes. Prior to the 1986 elections, Streisand
performed for 500 invited guests in her own backyard, raising
enough money to help elect five Democratic senators, thus restoring
a Democratic majority in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   She headlined concerts which raised millions for each of
Clinton's presidential campaigns and sang at his inaugural concert.
</P>
<P>
   Streisand was one of Hollywood's most outspoken defenders of the
President during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, stating that the
Republicans were using the impeachment issue as a means of
unraveling the achievements of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Streisand's commitment to Clinton extended to a personal nature.
She became friends and maintained a relationship the president's
mother, Virginia Kelley, until her death of breast cancer in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's post-convention event is an event because it will be
one of Streisand's final performances before she stops doing
concerts. (She will appear Sept. 20-21 at Staples Center and Sept.
27-28 in New York.)
</P>
<P>
   After receiving the Hollywood Foreign Press Association's Cecil
B. DeMille Award at the 57th annual Golden Globe Awards in January,
she told journalists that she didn't ``enjoy public performances
and being up on a stage. ... I like to be behind the camera or in a
recording studio.''
</P>
<P>
   While she is calling a halt to live shows, Streisand has no
plans to stop singing. A new disc, ``Timeless: Live in Concert,''
is due in stores Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the Democrats clearly scored this year in the
entertainment department, especially compared to the Republicans,
who at their convention were serenaded by Hank Williams Jr., Chubby
Checker, the Temptations, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire, a
lineup apparently enjoying a day pass from the State Fair circuit.
</P>
<P>
   The Shrine event also features Kenneth ``Babyface'' Edmonds,
Boyz II Men and Gladys Knight. Whoopi Goldberg hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Although many believe Streisand is quitting her concert career
due to her decades-old stage-fright, some reports suggest she and
husband James Brolin plan to adopt a baby girl. Streisand, who has
a 33-year-old son from a previous marriage, wed Brolin, 60, two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather travel,'' she said in January. ``We just like to
get in the car and go, stopping at motels and truck stops. We're
normal people. We like simple pleasures.''

ALBRIGHT PLEDGES TO SHED LIGHT ON ARGENTINE KIDNAPPINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
pledged on Wednesday that she would work to declassify U.S.
government documents that may shed light on the kidnappings of
hundreds of children from dissidents captured by the Argentine
military during the dictatorship that governed here from 1976 to
1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a matter of conscience,'' she said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who is on a five-day tour of five South American
nations, invited representatives of the Mothers of the Plaza de
Mayo and Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo for a meeting Wednesday
at the ambassador's residence.
</P>
<P>
   The Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, a rights group trying to
locate children believed stolen from their imprisoned mothers, has
requested that the Clinton administration open CIA files that could
help in its search. At the meeting, the groups also urged Albright
to release documents related to Operation Condor, a plan conceived
by several South American military dictatorships to arrest
dissidents in one another's countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I would do my best to see what kind of papers there
were,'' she told reporters. But in a reference to the Central
Intelligence Agency, she added, ``As you know, the State Department
is not the keeper of all the papers.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Adalberto Rodriguez Giavarini said he welcomed
the promise, adding, ``The government of Argentina thinks any acts
to clarify the past will be helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   But human rights activists expressed skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not believe her,'' said Hebe de Bonafini, president of
the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, adding that it was ``hypocritical
of Albright to say she is going to look into something that the
government she represents was largely responsible for.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo told
Albright that they held the United States responsible for
instructing Argentine officers at the School of the Americas, a
military academy at the time located in Panama.
</P>
<P>
   Historians of the period say that Washington's ties to the
Argentine military regime were not as close as its ties were to
Gen. Augusto Pinochet's regime in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the United States and Argentina were tense
during the Carter administration, especially after the junta sold
wheat to the Soviet Union in defiance of the embargo that
Washington instituted after Moscow invaded Afghanistan. And during
the Falklands War, the Reagan administration supported Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the CIA is believed to have had a robust
intelligence operation in Argentina at the time.
</P>
<P>
   From 15,000 to 30,000 people disappeared or were executed during
the ``dirty war'' between the military and two guerrilla groups,
the largest of which carried the banner of Peronist populism. Many
of those killed were students, labor activists and dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official said that there were far fewer
documents in government files that shed light on Argentina than
exist on Chile.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Chile, the CIA has continued to resist the
release of many documents.

MCCAIN HAS MELANOMA   ON ARM, HEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND ANN BARNARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Senator John S. McCain has been diagnosed with
melanoma, a form of skin cancer that is highly curable if found
early, but that quickly turns lethal if it is allowed to spread.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Wednesday, McCain's office said two
spots, one on his left arm and another on his left temple, had been
discovered in a routine exam. ``The spots were confirmed to be
melanomas,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   It is the second such diagnosis for the Arizona Republican, who
had a cancerous mole removed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The dignosis, which has forced McCain to cancel several campaign
appearances, confirmed suspicions among some people traveling with
him in recent weeks that he is ill.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, the Vietnam War hero who made a spirited run for the GOP
presidential nomination this spring, did not make any public
comments Wednesday. His last appearance was Sunday, when he hosted
Governor George W. Bush at his Sedona, Ariz. vacation home.
</P>
<P>
   The diagnosis was made after a biopsy Aug. 4 at the National
Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. McCain wore a bandage over
his left temple during his campaigning with Bush. At the time,
McCain kept the diagnosis quiet, saying only that he had a growth
removed.
</P>
<P>
   But he did mention the disease. Noting that the campaign swing
would bring the Bush entourage through Arizona, McCain told
reporters that his home state has ``the highest incidence of skin
cancer of any state in the union.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I advise everyone: Wear sunscreen,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who spent Wednesday at his Phoenix home, is planning to
hold a news conference to discuss his health. He hopes to make his
remarks after undergoing further tests this week at the Mayo Clinic
near Phoenix, where he will determine his course of treatment,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry, attending the Democratic National
Convention in Los Angeles, spoke Wednesday with McCain's wife,
Cindy. She said her husband ``is in very good spirits'' and planned
to call Kerry later, the senator said, adding that a ``procedure''
may be done at the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who will turn 64 this month, released his medical
history this year in an effort to dampen rumors that his 5 1/2
years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam had affected his mental
health.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, he also said a cancerous mole had been removed
from his shoulder in 1993. That incidence of melanoma had not
spread, and had not penetrated deep into his skin, and doctors had
cleared McCain as healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The news of McCain's diagnosis Wednesday prompted a flurry of
wishes for his speedy recovery from colleagues, many of whom saw
him two weeks ago, when he was a featured speaker at the Republican
National Convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who waged a fierce battle against McCain in the primaries
before reconciling with the senator and inviting him on the
campaign trail, issued a statement from his vacation home in
Crawford, Texas, wishing his former rival well. The two men did not
speak to each other Wednesday, said a Bush spokesman, Ari
Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know all Americans join Laura and me in wishing John McCain
a speedy recovery,'' the statement from Bush said. ``We just came
back from a visit to John and Cindy's home and our fondest thoughts
are with him and his family. John is a good man and a fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors were reluctant to comment on McCain's prognosis without
knowing details of his condition, but said the most important
factor is how thick the melanomas had grown.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you catch it early, it's nearly 100 percent curable. If
it's let go, it can approach 100 percent fatal,'' said Dr. Thomas
Rohrer, director of dermatologic surgery at Boston Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   People who develop one melanoma are about five times as likely
as the general population to develop a second one in their
lifetime, said Dr. Michael Atkins, an oncologist specializing in
melanoma at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. ``But
because they're being screened, oftentimes the subsequent melanomas
are picked up earlier, and the chance is better.''
</P>
<P>
   Melanoma is the least common of the three major skin cancers,
but potentially the most lethal. Around 44,700 new cases of
melanoma are expected in the United States this year, with about
7,700 deaths, Atkins said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Roher, melanoma is the leading cause of cancer
death for women between the ages of 25 and 30.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of melanomas can be cured with surgery alone,
Atkins said. But the thicker they grow, the greater the chance the
cancer has spread to the lymph nodes. If it is found there, Atkins
said, there is a 40 to 80 percent chance it has spread to other
organs, which makes it ``almost invariably fatal.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank G. Haluska, director of melanoma programs at Dana
Farber/Partners CancerCare in Boston, said it is important to know
whether McCain's melanomas are new ones or recurrences of the
original cancer, which would be more serious.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors stressed the need to wear sunscreen and protective
clothing and to get moles examined, taking advantage of the fact
that, as Rohrer put it, ``it's a fatal cancer that we have a unique
opportunity to see.''

MASTERCARD SUES NADER CAMPAIGN OVER TV AD PARODY 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mastercard International sued Ralph Nader's presidential
campaign Wednesday, saying that a Nader advertisement that parodies
one of the company's commercials violates its copyright and
trademark. The suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, seeks $5
million in damages and an injunction preventing the campaign from
running the advertisement again.
</P>
<P>
   The Nader advertisement takes Gov. George W. Bush and Vice
President Al Gore to task on the need for campaign finance reform,
and for excluding Nader from the presidential debates. The
announcer reads, ``Grilled tenderloin for fund-raiser: $1,000 a
plate. Campaign ads filled with half-truths: $10 million. Promises
to special interest groups: over $10 billion. Finding out the
truth: priceless. There are some things money can't buy. Without
Ralph Nader in the presidential debates, the truth will come in
last.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nader campaign's premiere television ad, which began airing
in early August in major markets throughout the United States, will
continue to air in Los Angeles during the Democratic National
Convention, said Laura Jones, a spokeswoman for Nader. The campaign
plans to hold a news conference in Washington on Thursday to
respond to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the 30-second ad has generated a ``tremendous
response.'' It has been successful, she said, in ``tapping into the
outrage'' for the way the current two-party political system works.
</P>
<P>
   ``This commercial has been successful precisely because it is
about how corporations are trying to shut down the political
process and shut out candidates who aren't beholden to them,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Chris O'Neill, vice president of global marketing for
Mastercard, based in Purchase, N.Y., said that the company had sent
a letter to the Nader campaign requesting that they stop airing the
ad. Discussions last week between Mastercard representatives and
the campaign ended without an agreement, O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main goal is to stop the ad from running,'' O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neill said that the company intends to ``protect the
ads,'' and that ``every day the ad airs, more damage is done.''

PACE OF CONSUMER INFLATION REGISTERS ONLY A SLIGHT GAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consumer inflation increased only slightly in July, the Labor
Department said Wednesday, reassuring analysts that the Federal
Reserve would find no need to raise interest rates again when it
meets Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Price Index rose a relatively modest 0.2 percent in
July, as oil and other energy prices showed little change after
gyrating for most of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This puts the final nail in the coffin of a rate hike next
week,'' said Bill Sharp, senior U.S. economist at Chase Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the case for Fed forbearance, the Commerce Department
said that builders had broken ground on 3.3 percent fewer new homes
in July than in June, the slowest pace since late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The price report contained few surprises, but allayed lingering
fears that the Fed, which has raised rates six times in the last
13{ months, would be forced to keep raising them to prevent an
outbreak of inflation. A report of strong retail sales last week
had kept such fears alive. Not counting energy and food, the rise
was 0.2 percent for the fourth consecutive month.
</P>
<P>
   The July results reduced the 12-month inflation rate to 3.5
percent from 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, economists noted a gradual uptick in the pace of
inflation this year that they said would need eventually to be
arrested _ even though it largely results from higher prices for a
volatile item like gasoline. Inflation increased at a 4 percent
pace for the first seven months of the year, compared with a 2.7
percent pace for the 1999 calendar year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing some inflation pressures,'' said Marilyn Schaja,
senior economist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``You can't rule
out a rate hike in the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Schaja said the weakness in Wednesday's home-building report
might have been exaggerated by poor weather. She also noted that
the decline in starts _ to an annual rate of 1,512,000 units _ was
confined to one region, the South.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market found little comfort in the reports, with
traders and investors promptly pushing rates up a bit from
Tuesday's levels.
</P>
<P>
   It was the energy component, which accounts for 7 percent of the
Consumer Price Index, that accounted for most of the deceleration.
After surging 5.6 percent in June, energy edged up 0.1 percent last
month as a 2 percent rise for energy services was largely offset by
a 1.6 percent decline for petroleum-based energy.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline fell 2 percent after an 8.8 percent jump in June but is
still 18.3 percent higher so far this year after soaring 30.1
percent in 1999. Airline fares, 0.7 percent higher last month, are
up 9.7 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Food prices climbed 0.5 percent after rising just 0.1 percent in
June, an acceleration that Patrick C. Jackman, a senior official at
the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said he could not explain in light
of an excellent growing season. Perhaps, he speculated, there was
some delayed impact from higher costs of transporting food.
</P>
<P>
   Medical care rose 0.3 percent last month and 4.1 percent for the
latest 12 months. A subindex dominated by prescription drugs, the
cost of which is likely to become an increasingly contentious
subject of political debate, has risen 4.2 percent in the last 12
months. This compares with a 6.1 percent increase in the 1999
calendar year.
</P>
<P>
   But hospital costs have accelerated this year, to a 7.2 percent
annual pace in the six months through July, compared with 5.3
percent for the six months ended in January.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called core inflation rate, which excludes food and
energy, has now risen at a 2.6 percent rate so far this year
compared with 1.9 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've picked up a bit but it's not accelerating,'' said Robert
G. Dederick, economic consultant to Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.
But while the current pace ``seems to be within the range of
Federal Reserve acceptability,'' Dederick said, it remains an open
question whether the economy will slow enough in coming months to
keep inflation in check without further rate increases later this
year or early in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer price report also showed that inflation in the New
York metropolitan area ran at a 3.1 percent rate over the last 12
months compared with 3.5 percent for the average of U.S. cities.
Dallas-Fort Worth, with 5 percent, was the highest of the seven
areas identified by name, with Chicago lowest, at 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The purchasing power of the 1982-84 consumer dollar now stands
at 57.9 cents, with the 1967 dollar at 19.3 cents. &QL;

DETERMINING TYPE AND SEVERITY OF MELANOMAS REQUIRES DETAILED
TESTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: With MCCAIN-CANCER)  
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whenever people develop melanoma, as Sen. John McCain of Arizona
did in 1993, they are told to check the moles on their skin for
changes and have their doctors monitor them for signs of a
recurrence, as well as for new skin cancers.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's doctors have said that he was cured of the melanoma
that they removed from his left shoulder in 1993. But until more
information is disclosed about the two new melanomas that McCain's
office said he has recently developed, it is impossible to say
whether they are similar to the curable one he had in 1993, or they
represent something more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors can sometimes tell from the appearance of a melanoma
whether it is more likely to be a new one or to have spread from
elsewhere in the body.
</P>
<P>
   New melanomas tend to be flat with irregular edges and those
that have spread, or metastatized, may be raised, said Dr. Bernard
S. Goffe, a dermatologist in Seattle, who is not connected with
McCain's case.
</P>
<P>
   But, Goffe said, a definitive answer can come only from a
pathologist's examination of cell patterns in the new melanomas,
after they are removed in a procedure known as a biopsy.
</P>
<P>
   Having one melanoma slightly raises the risk of developing
another melanoma, but an even greater chance of developing less
serious basal cell skin cancers.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's new melanomas were on his left arm and left temple. The
temple is a common site for new melanomas. If the new melanoma on
his arm is close to the site of the melanoma removed from his left
shoulder, the likelihood is increased that it was a recurrence or
spread.
</P>
<P>
   If the melanomas are new ones and similar to the one removed in
1993, the statistical chances for their cure is high. But if one or
both of the new melanomas has spread from elsewhere, then the
chances of a five-year survival are about 50 percent, Goffe said.
McCain will undergo tests to detect spread to lymph nodes and other
organs, according to the statement released by his office
concerning the new diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, when McCain was running for the Republican
presidential nomination, Dr. Thomas Hudak, a plastic surgeon who
removed McCain's melanoma in 1993, and Dr. John Eckstein, McCain's
physician at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Ariz., said in
interviews that his melanoma was cured.

 &HT;    CONVENTION NOTEBOOK: FROM DELEGATE DELAYS TO POLICE CHASES
 &HT;    Eds: Restores grafs lost in transmission
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Actress June Lockhart, best known for her TV roles
on ``Lassie'' and ``Lost in Space,'' watched a good portion of the
Democratic convention one night this week as she stood
shoulder-to-shoulder with photographers on the main camera stand
directly across from the podium on the convention floor. Lockhart
has been friends with many Washington-based photographers since the
mid-80's, having met some during Ronald Reagan's frequent trips to
his presidential ranch in California. She attends the annual White
House News Photographers Awards dinner in Washington every year.
</P>
<P>
   As the convention nears its end, there have been mounting
complaints about transportation provided for delegates and members
of the press. Some buses, designated to shuttle them from their
hotels to the downtown convention site and back, have showed up
very late.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, some delegates probably wished their bus hadn't
shown up at all. A bus load of Georgia delegates wound up calling
police on a cell phone when a shuttle driver refused to let them
off at their hotel. Three Los Angeles sheriff's vehicles, lights
flashing, stopped the bus and escorted passengers from the vehicle,
the delegates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is the drivers haven't been instructed properly,''
Georgia party chairman David Worley told irritated delegates, some
of whom said they rode around for two hours on a bus when the
driver got lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been enormous screw-ups with transportation,''
Worley said. ``It's a major problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Each day of the convention is like any other party for the Ohio
delegates. Have a good time. Play hard. But when it's over, take me
home.
</P>
<P>
   That last part hasn't been easy. On Monday a violent clash
between police and protesters blocked streets after the convention
closed. Those fortunate enough to get a seat on a shuttle bus were
stuck and others had to walk more than a mile just to search for a
taxi.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, post-convention sailing appeared to be smooth for about
50 delegates as their shuttle bus headed back to the hotel. Then
came the crash
</P>
<P>
   A $50,000 sports car rammed a $40,000 SUV next to the bus on a
crowded Los Angeles street. A police officer accompanying the bus
riders got off to assist those involved in the accident.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 minutes passed for the tired group before the officer
got back on the bus. He pulled out his notebook and asked, ``Okay,
who saw what happened?''
</P>
<P>
   The officer smiled and didn't pursue the questioning _ just in
time to avoid another riot at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's a sobering thought for Democrats who think their
convention has viewers glued to their TV sets. Late Monday night,
after the convention session ended, several Los Angeles television
stations broke away from regular programming for live coverage of a
high-speed chase. TV helicopters followed the dramatic chase as LA
police pursued a red vehicle as it sped around the city. It
eventually crashed and the driver was arrested. Later, a recap of
local TV ratings for at least one station showed that it attracted
22 percent of viewers while other stations' recaps of convention
events drew only 4 percent to 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Black Caucus members rubbed shoulders with the
Hollywood elite during a luncheon at Paramount Studios on
Wednesday. As the program opened, the usually imposing and serious
Jim Clyburn, the Democratic congressman from South Carolina who
chairs the caucus, took the podium. He soberly looked out over the
star-dotted audience. It included Telma Hopkins, whose initial fame
came from being part of Tony Orlando's Dawn, the singer's backup
crooners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good Lord has been good to me today,'' Clyburn announced.
``He made it so that I would not get to meet Telma Hopkins until I
was 60 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because,'' he added, ``I spent a certain amount of time in my
former life drooling over Telma Hopkins.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins giggled and turned a deep shade of red.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Howard Metzenbaum, the feisty 83-year-old former three-term
senator from Ohio, has spent much of his time at the Democratic
convention trying to motivate delegates to fight for party
candidates. After a rousing speech Tuesday to the Ohio delegation,
Metzenbaum got so many handshakes, hugs and hurrahs that he
proclaimed: ``I think I'll run as a write-in.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes and his wife, Marie, celebrated their
30th wedding anniversary at the convention. ``With Rodeo Drive
right out here, I don't know if I'm going to be able to afford
it,'' Barnes joked. Georgia delegates stayed in Hollywood, minutes
from the glitzy shopping boulevard.

HEWLETT-PACKARD CITES 23 PERCENT QUARTERLY GAIN, BEATING
FORECASTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Hewlett-Packard Co. on Wednesday reported
quarterly earnings that beat analysts' estimates, driven primarily
by strong sales of personal computers and printers. Its board also
approved a stock split.
</P>
<P>
   For the third quarter ended July 31, Hewlett-Packard reported
earnings of $1.05 billion, or 99 cents a diluted share, up 23
percent from $853 million, or 66 cents a share, in the comparable
period a year ago. Revenue rose 15 percent, to $11.82 billion from
$10.32 billion, in the third quarter of fiscal 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding equity gains, Hewlett-Packard had earnings of 97 cents
a diluted share, compared with similarly adjusted earnings of 71
cents a share in the comparable period a year ago. Analysts had
expected the company to earn 85 cents a share, according to First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard reported its results after the close of the
market. Its shares closed at $120 each, up $9.56, on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attributed the jump in earnings largely to
higher-than-expected interest income, a more favorable tax rate and
other nonoperating contributors. Overall revenue growth of 15
percent was merely in line with expectations, they said, and the 13
percent sales growth of the crucial Unix business was
disappointing, particularly in comparison with sales growth of 42
percent in the most recent quarter for Sun Microsystems Inc., the
Unix market leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The top line was sort of in line with the target, and the
bottom line above, but there were significant contributions to the
bottom line,'' said Laura Conigliaro, an analyst with Goldman,
Sachs, noting that tax considerations added 3 cents to earnings per
share, with 6 cents coming from higher interest income. ``It's a
good quarter, with evidence that there are better things to come,
with some of the strongest evidence from some ironic areas, PCs and
printers, where others seem to be struggling,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Milunovich of Merrill Lynch had a more positive
interpretation of the results, which marked the end of Carly
Fiorina's first four quarters as president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when you take out the extraordinary items, they appear to
have beat our estimates for operating income,'' he said. ``I think
it shows that HP continues to be on the recovery trail, that
Carly's initiatives are beginning to pay off, and that the company
is beginning to show some consistency in earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Hewlett-Packard saw declining revenue from commercial
desktop personal computers in the quarter, its home PC business
grew 62 percent in revenue and notebooks grew 93 percent. The
imaging and printing systems segment _ laser and inkjet printing,
and imaging devices _ grew 15 percent in revenue year over year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year at this time, we committed to becoming a more
aggressive and focused HP, delivering strong top and bottom line
growth on a consistent basis,'' Fiorina said in a statement.
``Today's results demonstrate the tremendous progress we're making
in all of our businesses around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Hewlett-Packard said its Unix server business had grown
by only 13 percent in revenue year over year, it reported order
growth of 23 percent in dollars and 43 percent in units. Fiorina
said the company had gained market share at the low end, increased
its lead in the mid-range, but slowed at the high end, in
anticipation of the launching of a new high-end server line, called
SuperDome, in mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   ``How is it that their sales of high-end product dry up when
they're in product transition while Sun's accelerate?'' said Daniel
Kunstler, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. ``I would say a relative
disappointment in Unix was offset by color printing and a strong
consumer business in general. Their sense of purpose really should
be geared toward Unix because that's where there's margin, and
that's where they've lost leadership they think they can regain.''
</P>
<P>
   A stock split of two shares for one, which was announced
Wednesday, will be effective Oct. 27. The quarterly results reflect
continuing operations and exclude the industrial instrument
business that was spun off this year as Agilent Technologies.

FOR THIS PROTEST, LAPD WAS THE MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ To their mutual benefit, everyone was getting
along nicely Wednesday when the handcuffs came out.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of demonstration organizers, only those
protesters willing to be arrested sat down on the police station
steps. The rest of the crowd stepped back. Then, speaking calmly
into a bullhorn, an officer announced that the arrests would
commence, and asked the people headed to jail to please remain
seated until each one had been led inside.
</P>
<P>
   No one screamed obscenities at police, who lined the street and
stood with batons at the ready. Nor did police fire pepper spray or
rubber bullets at the hundreds of demonstrators massed outside the
city's most notorious station house. With each side armed with
video cameras, no one wanted more trouble on a day when the theme
was police brutality and other perceived injustices in the judicial
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are having a demonstration, not a riot, and so far the
police seem to be exercising restraint,'' said Shawn McDougal, a
local community activist. ``They're obviously aware of the
attention on them. And we know that the best way to get our message
out is peacefully.''
</P>
<P>
   But peace is not news, and television camera crews pressed as
close as possible to the protesters who sat with their heads bowed
and mouths gagged in symbolism. The journalists were the only ones
ordered to move. Neither the demonstrators who stood with fists
raised nor the scores of officers at every nearby corner took an
angry step toward each other.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-seven people were arrested, all of them voluntarily,
charged with misdemeanors for trespassing and blocking a public
building, police said. By midday, that brought the number of
arrests since Saturday, when people started arriving for the
Democratic National Convention, to 189. That's a fraction of the
arrests that occured when the Republicans met in Philadelphia
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice and peaceful, and that's how it should be,'' said
Officer Jason Lee, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police
Department. ``People demonstrate and raise their concerns and, in
turn, we not only protect other citizens but also the
demonstrations. Obviously they know the law and we know the law and
it worked out fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The mutual cooperation, which extended to a large afternoon
demonstration against the death penalty, mass incarceration and
other law enforcement issues, was a turnaround from Monday night,
when police on horseback swept through a crowd of concertgoers
after a handful caused trouble. Afterward, police defended their
use of pepper spray, rubber bullets and other anti-riot weaponry
although no riot had occurred. Numerous injuries, none of them
serious, were reported by organizers of the protests surrounding
the DNC, which ends Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the convention, much of downtown Los Angeles has
resembled a militarized zone, with phalanxes of police officers on
corner after corner while others patrolled the streets by squad
car, motorcycle and bicycle. Time and again, department officials
have said they understood that all eyes were on their force, now
embroiled in a far reaching corruption scandal that is expected to
result in the dismissal of hundreds of tainted cases. The scandal
is centered at the Rampart Station where Wednesday's first
demonstration took place after a march from MacArthur Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really glad this community right here has the voice and
the will to come out here and demonstrate about what has to be
fixed,'' said Alex Sanchez, whose activist brother remains in jail
although he is widely believed to have been framed by corrupt
officers from the Rampart division. ``The Democrats are gathering
here and this is our only chance to be heard by them. But they're
covering their ears and refusing to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   The police, at least, had no choice but to listen Wednesday. For
hours in the hot California sun, they were face to face with some
of their harshest and most constant critics -- young people from
poorer neighborhoods who complain they are often harassed without
cause. Together with adult activists and others concerned about the
still-spreading scandal, they set forth their demands in unison: an
end to racial profiling and the establishment of an independent
civilian review board to investigate Rampart Division, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for those of us who oppose oppression in one
area to stand with people who oppose oppression in another,'' said
Tim Ream, an environmental activist from Eugene, Oregon. ``I'm
willing to get arrested, but I hope I don't. Then again, whenever
you step into the street to protest the LAPD, you have to be
willing to get arrested, although it's pretty organized here
today.''

   WILLEY-COLUMN (Los Angeles) {ndash} The Democrats' lack of
discipline this week is evident on and off the convention floor.
Whether this splintering of message, this thematic disorganization,
is a harbinger of Democratic frustration at the polls this fall
remains unclear. But Republicans managed to close their convention
in Philly having significantly boosted their image among Americans
nationwide. Democrats have yet to prove they will do the same.

   PIMENTEL-COLUMN (Los Angeles) - You had to be here. Or not. If
you ever want to find out what it's like to live in a police state,
attend a national party convention. There really is nothing less
democratic, small d, than a party convention these days. Sadly, all
the democracy has occurred long before the delegates get here. By

   LOS ANGELES _ At the Democratic convention this week, good
manners reign supreme. Despite many doubts, most African-American
delegates are supporting Al Gore's choice for a running mate, Sen.
Joseph Lieberman. Even Maxine Waters, the outspoken congresswoman
from California, has announced that after talking to Lieberman
about his views on affirmative action, she is now on board.
</P>
<P>
   But outward party unity doesn't mean that internal fissures have
disappeared. Indeed, the selection of Lieberman points to some real
differences between Gore and black Democrats. And these differences
are important to his chances in November.
</P>
<P>
   There is general agreement among political analysts that the
election will be close and that the band of states between New
Jersey and Missouri, (plus North Carolina, Georgia, Florida,
Louisiana, Arkansas and Tennessee) are likely to determine the next
president.
</P>
<P>
   These states have significant numbers of black voters, who are
reliably Democratic, that is, if they go to the polls. To win this
election, Gore will have to ensure that black turnout is high.
</P>
<P>
   The problem? It's hard to imagine that his selection of
Lieberman will galvanize them to vote. As a pollster and researcher
who has long followed African-American politics, I know that of all
the people mentioned as Gore's possible running mate, Lieberman was
the one least likely to appeal to African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   There are political reasons why this is so. Despite his
reassurances this week, he was not known as a supporter of
affirmative action, especially after his favorable comments about
California's proposition that outlawed affirmative action in all
state programs. In addition, for four years, he has been chairman
of the Democratic Leadership Council, which represents moderate and
conservative Democrats as a counterweight to liberals like Jesse
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers have said that anti-Semitism among a minority of
the black population could play a role. There have been several
surveys, most notably those done for the Anti-Defamation League,
that suggest African-Americans are more anti-Semitic than white
Americans. I don't entirely buy the results of these surveys, in
part because anti-Semitism, like racism, is a difficult thing to
assess.
</P>
<P>
   In surveys, for example, I have heard African-Americans refer to
Jewish wealth, but many working class and poor African-Americans
talk that way about all white people.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Democratic ticket, there is more a sense of
``why not us?'' Many black Americans feel they have been the most
loyal Democrats and wonder why a black politician hasn't been
selected by now. This feeling is not about anti-Semitism, but about
once again being left out.
</P>
<P>
   The root of black ambivalence about Lieberman, however, could be
more specific. The vice president chose the one man who carries
with him an implicit, some would say open, repudiation of Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's speech calling Clinton's actions immoral in the
Monica Lewinsky scandal was widely praised. Indeed, after Lieberman
was selected, this factor was cited favorably, and seen as helping
Al Gore distance himself from the president.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a news flash for you: Black Americans want to celebrate
Clinton. They don't care about his personal life. During his
administration, African-Americans have prospered as never before.
Incomes have risen faster than those of whites. Affirmative action
has been protected. Clinton made Africa part of his foreign policy.
The cabinet has been inclusive.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Bill Clinton already has a legacy _ he is the first
president to fully embrace black America.
</P>
<P>
   In the last eight years, African-Americans have gotten used to
being taken seriously. They want that influence to continue, and
are waiting for Gore to send a signal that it will. Unfortunately,
Al Gore's selection of Lieberman sends a different signal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore now finds himself in a position of having to assure black
voters that they will have a real voice in his administration, that
their concerns will be addressed. The pollsters can talk all they
want about reaching out to swing voters. But Al Gore knows he
cannot win without a high black turnout.

Center for Political and Economic Studies, a group that researches

THE GOP'S PAY GAP

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Democrats are saying this week in Los Angeles
that the military is strong and fit, while campaigning Republicans
contend that the Clinton administration has run America's defenses
down. It's a complex issue, but in at least one aspect _ military
pay _ Republican scorn is misplaced. The GOP platform says
Americans in uniform face a 13 percent ``pay gap'' relative to
their civilian counterparts. But when President Clinton took
office, the gap was already 11.5 percent, all accumulated in the
Reagan and Bush presidencies.
</P>
<P>
   The gap the Republicans cite does not reflect a direct
calculation of pay differences between the military and the private
sector; it compares pay raises since 1982. Proponents of higher
military pay like to use that year as their starting point because
it makes the gap look as large as possible. Basically, their
calculation presumes that since the draft was abolished in 1973,
the military has been paid fairly only once: in 1982, after two
years of double-digit pay increases under Jimmy Carter and Ronald
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1983 budget, Reagan struck a bargain with Congress to
limit the military's pay raise to 4 percent, even though civilian
wage growth was twice that high. That created the gap _ making it 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1980s, the gap continued to widen; the military
received raises that were generally smaller than those in the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans might of course point out that Democratic congresses
passed the pay bills. But year after year in the 1980s, Republican
defense secretaries specifically requested raises for the military
that lagged behind the private sector. Most of the time, Congress
authorized what was requested.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of the so-called pay gap did not signal that
Reagan and President George Bush did not respect or appreciate the
military; nor does its small growth under Clinton mean that he has
run the military down.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, administrations and congresses
worked to strike a balance between the military's needs and the
urgency of reducing federal deficits. At the same time, defense
commanders tried to balance the military's needs. Good pay is one
of several tools to attract and retain capable troops. As long as
the services were able to do this, pay raises were capped in favor
of spending on weapons, force structure and training. When
recruiting and retention faltered, defense leaders added more to
pay and other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy paid off. In the Persian Gulf war in 1991, with the
reported pay gap already at more than 11 percent, the United States
fielded the best equipped and trained fighting forces in the world.
This year, after two years of weakness in recruiting, all four
services appear to be meeting their goals. If that success
continues, the Pentagon's priorities may swing again, and future
military officials may choose to devote scarce resources to
something else besides pay increases.

IN HOLLYWOOD, THERE'S ALWAYS TOMORROW
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
Everyone can pretty much agree that the summer of 2000 was a bust,
movie-wise. Overhyped disappointments led to bad word-of-mouth
which equaled steep second-week attendance falloffs and a general
sense that Hollywood, more than unusual, didn't know what it was
doing.
<TEXT>
<P>
   With nothing really exciting to go out there and see, then, we
thought we'd get overly optimistic and whet your appetite with what
the studios plan to unleash a year or so from now. Admittedly, 12
months ago ``Hollow Man,'' ``Loser'' and ``Titan A.E.'' sounded as
good in theory as a lot of the big 2001 releases seem now, so we're
not guaranteeing any quality in the titles we're about to list.
</P>
<P>
   What we can give you an indication of, however, is the
anticipation that's building for certain releases. Some of next
year's films are getting more attention than others from the rabid
film fans who attend conventions and religiously scroll such movie
preview Internet sites as aint-it-cool-news.com, Coming Attractions
(corona.bc.ca/films/), comingsoon.adp and darkhorizons.com, where
every production hiccup and scrap of data about such anointed
projects as Steven Spielberg's ``A.I.'' is obsessively examined,
debated and blown out of proportion.
</P>
<P>
   Some more obsessively than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three films slated for Christmas 2001 that are
already making huge waves in the online community,'' notes Coming
Attractions' content director Patrick Sauriol. ``Sony's
`Spider-Man,' Warner Bros.' 'Harry Potter' and New Line's first
'Lord of the Rings' movie. Even if the movies themselves are
lacking, all three of these are going to open huge, regardless. The
buzz, even more than a year away from their release, is already
building.''
</P>
<P>
   As of this moment in time, The odds-on winner of the 2001
popularity contest is ``The Fellowship of the Ring,'' the first of
three, simultaneously shot screen adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien's
classic ``Lord of the Rings'' fantasy trilogy. Filmed in New
Zealand by director Peter Jackson (``Heavenly Creatures,'' ``Dead
Alive'') and starring Elijah Wood, Cate Blanchett and Ian McKellen,
the effects spectacular has gotten high marks for casting and the
look of its first trailer, which New Line Cinema put online
(lordoftherings.net) to the greatest download response for such a
thing in Web history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's anticipated to do for fantasy films what 'Star Wars' did
for sci fi,'' notes Harry Knowles, Ain't It Cool's founder and main
movie maven.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter Jackson's got the near-impossible task of translating
the 20th century's best-loved fantasy series into three movies _
and from the early footage that New Line's shown, he's on the right
track,'' Sauriol adds. ``At conventions, on the Internet, across
the Web, the early 'Rings' footage has really jump-started the
positive buzz.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you'll recall that everyone got all psyched by the
``Phantom Menace'' trailer George Lucas released half a year prior
to the movie's opening, but then everyone found fault with the
actual picture. Whether the same fate awaits ``Fellowship,'' it's
almost inevitable when a property with a huge, built-in audience
from a previous incarnation hits the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   This will be a problem many of next year's most anxiously
awaited blockbusters will have to surmount. There is optimism for
some (widespread approval for the casting of Tobey Maguire as the
geeky teen-turned-webslinger in the long-delayed ``Spider-Man''
movie, praise for the complex, intelligent script of another comic
book-derived project, the Johnny Depp-starring Jack the Ripper
gloss ``From Hell''). There is pessimism for others (director Tim
Burton is reportedly already clashing with Fox executives about his
loose adaptation of ``Planet of the Apes,'' ``The Visitor,'' over
the inclusion of an interspecies sex scene; general displeasure
about the casting of Tea Leoni in ``Jurassic Park 3'').
</P>
<P>
   But after only kinda/sorta liking ``The X-Men,'' ``Shaft'' and
``The Perfect Storm'' this summer, fans are taking what might be
termed a concerned wait-and-see attitude toward most of next year's
derivatives.
</P>
<P>
   Though judgment is being held on whether or not the
ultra-expensive, computer-animated film version of the blockbuster
video game ``Final Fantasy'' (finalfantasy.com) actually works as a
narrative, there is pride in Geekdom that the film has apparently
proven that virtually generated humans are now convincing enough to
co-star in live-action movies, like the just-announced Al Pacino
feature ``Simone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hannibal,'' the gory sequel to ``The Silence of the Lambs,''
brings Anthony Hopkins back to his Oscar-winning role of genius
man-eater Dr. Lecter. But Julianne Moore replaces Jodie Foster in
the key position of FBI agent Clarice Starling, and that's not all
that's going to be different from the lucrative, original Academy
Awards darling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clarice is really not the primary character here; she's not
supporting, but it's his piece,'' notes Jeffrey Wells, who writes
the Hollywood Confidential insider column for the reel.com Web site
and visited the Ridley Scott-directed sequel's Italian location
earlier this year. ``And it's much darker, which I think makes it
kind of cool. But don't tell the suits that.''
</P>
<P>
   And while everyone wants to see how ``Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone'' (www.harrypotter.com) makes the transition from
bestselling page to celluloid, few really trust superficial
schlockmeister Chris Columbus (``Home Alone,'' ``Stepmom,''
``Bicentennial Man'') to properly plumb the novel's, um, deep inner
meaning. And with Haley Joel Osment out of the running, there's
angst over who'll be picked to play the junior wizard, too.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the creepy ``Sixth Sense'' kid, he's the title
Artificial Intelligence of ``A.I.'' The top-secret production,
which the late Stanley Kubrick developed for many years before
Spielberg took over, is quite understandably next year's most
anticipated feature of a relatively unknown quantity, not least
because it's the respected filmmaker's first directing effort since
the admired ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wells cautions that ``A.I.'' may prove more familiar than
the cloak of secrecy surrounding its production would indicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is 'Pinocchio,' basically, or even 'Bicentennial Kid,''' he
reports.
</P>
<P>
   And the other big ``original'' on the '01 horizon, producer
Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay's ultra-expensive ``From
Here to Eter ...'' er, that is, ``Titanic Goes Hawaiian'' ... wait,
we mean, ``Pearl Harbor,'' is basically expected to be a slam-bang
depiction of the World War II sneak attack with a sappy romantic
triangle between Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett
woven through it. The only thing you can reasonably expect that you
haven't seen before in this one from the ``Armageddon'' team is
bigger battleship explosions. (An unofficial Web site devoted to
the director _ michaelbay.com _ has pictures taken on the set.)
</P>
<P>
   Other selections for films that might float some boats next year
include: from AICN's Knowles, Pixar (``Toy Story'') Animation's
``Monsters Inc.'' and the Coen Brothers' untitled black-and-white
barber movie starring Billy Bob Thornton; from Coming Attraction's
Sauriol, DreamWorks' CGI animated ogre comedy ``Shrek,'' Disney's
traditionally animated Jules Verne-like ``Atlantis'' and the
Farrelly Brothers' partially animated ``Osmosis Jones,'' in which
Chris Rock and David Hyde Pierce magically enter the bloodstream of
a virus-infected Bill Murray; and Hollywood Confidential's Wells is
looking forward to two adult-skewing crime dramas _ ``The Mexican''
with Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts and Martin Scorsese's 19th
century-set ``Gangs of New York'' starring Leonardo DiCaprio.
</P>
<P>
   As for me, I've learned through countless hours of dashed
expectations that most movies don't come out as good as they sound
on paper, and the best ones are more often than not complete
surprises that few anticipated (``American Beauty,'' anyone?). So
the only thing I'm promoting for 2001 at this point is ``2001: A
Space Odyssey,'' Kubrick's never surpassed, visionary sci fi
parable, which Warners is thinking of reissuing around January.
</P>
<P>
   I can confidently assure you that it will be one of the best
movies you'll see next year. &QL;

schlockmeister Chris Columbus (``Home Alone,'' ``Stepmom,''
``Bicentennial Man'') to properly plumb the novel's, um, deep inner
meaning. And with Haley Joel Osment out of the running, there's
angst over who'll be picked to play the junior wizard, too.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the creepy ``Sixth Sense'' kid, he's the title
Artificial Intelligence of ``A.I.'' The top-secret production,
which the late Stanley Kubrick developed for many years before
Spielberg took over, is quite understandably next year's most
anticipated feature of a relatively unknown quantity, not least
because it's the respected filmmaker's first directing effort since
the admired ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wells cautions that ``A.I.'' may prove more familiar than
the cloak of secrecy surrounding its production would indicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is 'Pinocchio,' basically, or even 'Bicentennial Kid,''' he
reports.
</P>
<P>
   And the other big ``original'' on the '01 horizon, producer
Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay's ultra-expensive ``From
Here to Eter ...'' er, that is, ``Titanic Goes Hawaiian'' ... wait,
we mean, ``Pearl Harbor,'' is basically expected to be a slam-bang
depiction of the World War II sneak attack with a sappy romantic
triangle between Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett
woven through it. The only thing you can reasonably expect that you
haven't seen before in this one from the ``Armageddon'' team is
bigger battleship explosions. (An unofficial Web site devoted to
the director _ michaelbay.com _ has pictures taken on the set.)
</P>
<P>
   Other selections for films that might float some boats next year
include: from AICN's Knowles, Pixar (``Toy Story'') Animation's
``Monsters Inc.'' and the Coen Brothers' untitled black-and-white
barber movie starring Billy Bob Thornton; from Coming Attraction's
Sauriol, DreamWorks' CGI animated ogre comedy ``Shrek,'' Disney's
traditionally animated Jules Verne-like ``Atlantis'' and the
Farrelly Brothers' partially animated ``Osmosis Jones,'' in which
Chris Rock and David Hyde Pierce magically enter the bloodstream of
a virus-infected Bill Murray; and Hollywood Confidential's Wells is
looking forward to two adult-skewing crime dramas _ ``The Mexican''
with Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts and Martin Scorsese's 19th
century-set ``Gangs of New York'' starring Leonardo DiCaprio.
</P>
<P>
   As for me, I've learned through countless hours of dashed
expectations that most movies don't come out as good as they sound
on paper, and the best ones are more often than not complete
surprises that few anticipated (``American Beauty,'' anyone?). So
the only thing I'm promoting for 2001 at this point is ``2001: A
Space Odyssey,'' Kubrick's never surpassed, visionary sci fi
parable, which Warners is thinking of reissuing around January.
</P>
<P>
   I can confidently assure you that it will be one of the best
movies you'll see next year. &QL;

IN HOLLYWOOD, THERE'S ALWAYS TOMORROW
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
Everyone can pretty much agree that the summer of 2000 was a bust,
movie-wise. Overhyped disappointments led to bad word-of-mouth
which equaled steep second-week attendance falloffs and a general
sense that Hollywood, more than unusual, didn't know what it was
doing.
<TEXT>
<P>
   With nothing really exciting to go out there and see, then, we
thought we'd get overly optimistic and whet your appetite with what
the studios plan to unleash a year or so from now. Admittedly, 12
months ago ``Hollow Man,'' ``Loser'' and ``Titan A.E.'' sounded as
good in theory as a lot of the big 2001 releases seem now, so we're
not guaranteeing any quality in the titles we're about to list.
</P>
<P>
   What we can give you an indication of, however, is the
anticipation that's building for certain releases. Some of next
year's films are getting more attention than others from the rabid
film fans who attend conventions and religiously scroll such movie
preview Internet sites as aint-it-cool-news.com, Coming Attractions
(corona.bc.ca/films/), comingsoon.adp and darkhorizons.com, where
every production hiccup and scrap of data about such anointed
projects as Steven Spielberg's ``A.I.'' is obsessively examined,
debated and blown out of proportion.
</P>
<P>
   Some more obsessively than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three films slated for Christmas 2001 that are
already making huge waves in the online community,'' notes Coming
Attractions' content director Patrick Sauriol. ``Sony's
`Spider-Man,' Warner Bros.' 'Harry Potter' and New Line's first
'Lord of the Rings' movie. Even if the movies themselves are
lacking, all three of these are going to open huge, regardless. The
buzz, even more than a year away from their release, is already
building.''
</P>
<P>
   As of this moment in time, The odds-on winner of the 2001
popularity contest is ``The Fellowship of the Ring,'' the first of
three, simultaneously shot screen adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien's
classic ``Lord of the Rings'' fantasy trilogy. Filmed in New
Zealand by director Peter Jackson (``Heavenly Creatures,'' ``Dead
Alive'') and starring Elijah Wood, Cate Blanchett and Ian McKellen,
the effects spectacular has gotten high marks for casting and the
look of its first trailer, which New Line Cinema put online
(lordoftherings.net) to the greatest download response for such a
thing in Web history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's anticipated to do for fantasy films what 'Star Wars' did
for sci fi,'' notes Harry Knowles, Ain't It Cool's founder and main
movie maven.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter Jackson's got the near-impossible task of translating
the 20th century's best-loved fantasy series into three movies _
and from the early footage that New Line's shown, he's on the right
track,'' Sauriol adds. ``At conventions, on the Internet, across
the Web, the early 'Rings' footage has really jump-started the
positive buzz.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you'll recall that everyone got all psyched by the
``Phantom Menace'' trailer George Lucas released half a year prior
to the movie's opening, but then everyone found fault with the
actual picture. Whether the same fate awaits ``Fellowship,'' it's
almost inevitable when a property with a huge, built-in audience
from a previous incarnation hits the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   This will be a problem many of next year's most anxiously
awaited blockbusters will have to surmount. There is optimism for
some (widespread approval for the casting of Tobey Maguire as the
geeky teen-turned-webslinger in the long-delayed ``Spider-Man''
movie, praise for the complex, intelligent script of another comic
book-derived project, the Johnny Depp-starring Jack the Ripper
gloss ``From Hell''). There is pessimism for others (director Tim
Burton is reportedly already clashing with Fox executives about his
loose adaptation of ``Planet of the Apes,'' ``The Visitor,'' over
the inclusion of an interspecies sex scene; general displeasure
about the casting of Tea Leoni in ``Jurassic Park 3'').
</P>
<P>
   But after only kinda/sorta liking ``The X-Men,'' ``Shaft'' and
``The Perfect Storm'' this summer, fans are taking what might be
termed a concerned wait-and-see attitude toward most of next year's
derivatives.
</P>
<P>
   Though judgment is being held on whether or not the
ultra-expensive, computer-animated film version of the blockbuster
video game ``Final Fantasy'' (finalfantasy.com) actually works as a
narrative, there is pride in Geekdom that the film has apparently
proven that virtually generated humans are now convincing enough to
co-star in live-action movies, like the just-announced Al Pacino
feature ``Simone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hannibal,'' the gory sequel to ``The Silence of the Lambs,''
brings Anthony Hopkins back to his Oscar-winning role of genius
man-eater Dr. Lecter. But Julianne Moore replaces Jodie Foster in
the key position of FBI agent Clarice Starling, and that's not all
that's going to be different from the lucrative, original Academy
Awards darling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clarice is really not the primary character here; she's not
supporting, but it's his piece,'' notes Jeffrey Wells, who writes
the Hollywood Confidential insider column for the reel.com Web site
and visited the Ridley Scott-directed sequel's Italian location
earlier this year. ``And it's much darker, which I think makes it
kind of cool. But don't tell the suits that.''
</P>
<P>
   And while everyone wants to see how ``Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone'' (www.harrypotter.com) makes the transition from
bestselling page to celluloid, few really trust superficial
schlockmeister Chris Columbus (``Home Alone,'' ``Stepmom,''
``Bicentennial Man'') to properly plumb the novel's, um, deep inner
meaning. And with Haley Joel Osment out of the running, there's
angst over who'll be picked to play the junior wizard, too.

LITTLE MORE THAN A BIG ASSAULT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The folks who made ``The Cell'' _ screenwriter Mark Protosevich
and Tarsem Singh, an award-winning TV ad director whose music
videos include REM's ``Losing My Religion'' _ claim that they were
out to take the next step beyond ``Silence of the Lambs'' with this
serial killer mindtrip.
</P>
<P>
   What they've come up with is more like the evil stepsister of
``What Dreams May Come,'' an over-the-top collection of
art-directed, superficially surreal images that impart sadistic
wish-dreams rather than New Agey muddle hugs. It's imaginatively
designed, undeniably, but with all the aesthetic taste of a fetish
fashion show _ and less heart.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Lopez wears many strange costumes, extreme makeup and a
grave demeanor as child psychologist Catherine Deane. She's
involved in a long-running, high-tech experiment to reach into the
shut-down brain of a young coma victim _ whose parents just happen
to be as rich as Microsoft, but who are growing tired of
bankrolling the slow process to revive their son.
</P>
<P>
   This involves Catherine's entering the kid's mindscape, trying
to gain his trust, then theoretically leading him out of his inner
prison, which looks like the Sahara, only with derelict ships. The
apparatus that enables this effort suspends Catherine and the boy
in a sealed chamber, clad in rubberized, circuitry-loaded
jumpsuits, where she's electro-chemically put into her own deep
sleep state in order to dream her way into his.
</P>
<P>
   If you think that sounds kinky, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Somewhere in the adjacent desert, a complete whacko named Carl
(Vincent D'Onofrio) is kidnapping young women, sealing them in a
hidden kind of fishbowl cell and videotaping their terror as the
chamber automatically fills to the top with water. He retrieves
said tapes for later self-pleasuring (the metal rings pierced into
his back also play a part in this lovely ritual) and bleaches the
drowned corpses to look like dolls before dumping them in
convenient arroyos.
</P>
<P>
   And if you think that's sick ... obsessive FBI investigator
Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) tracks Carl down, but not before the
murderer suffers a brain seizure. The only hope of finding his
latest victim before she's automatically submerged is to send
Catherine into the dormant lunatic's mind. This is, as you might
imagine, potentially dangerous for the visitor's psyche, too,
seeing as how Carl's head is filled with horse-dissecting systems,
medieval torture methods and memories of his own twisted child
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, the clock is ticking ...
</P>
<P>
   Tarsem, as the director prefers to be called, rotates his
frames, step-cuts his montage, tosses in vulgarized ``2001'' light
shows, switches film stocks willy nilly and distorts sound like
crazy, and those are among the more sober tricks he employs to
remind us that we're in a crazy dreamscape where anything can
happen and, as characters keep reminding one another, ``nothing is
real.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, but a lot of it is really disgusting. Tarsem and his
crew have genuinely grotesque imaginations, and the horrors
depicted in ``The Cell'' are as unpleasant to watch as anything
modern cinema has unleashed. Perhaps because they're wrapped up in
such a hokey, sci-fi/fantasy context, the graphic mortifications
lack the soul-chilling charge similarly upsetting scenes lent to
films such as ``Lambs'' and ``Seven.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, those pictures were made by movie directors, who knew
something about how much to show and what to leave to a viewer's
spiked imagination. Straight as he comes from the ad world, Tarsem,
whatever his gifts for composing a scene, has not yet learned that
throwing everything he's got in someone's face isn't necessarily
the most effective visual storytelling strategy.
</P>
<P>
   And even when the stuff he's hurling isn't designed to make you
hurl, it's still overwrought imagery with no variation in volume
control. When every shot in a movie is meant to wow you, none of
them really does the job. A lot of work went into making ``The
Cell'' a state-of-the-art sensory assault, but you'd get
essentially the same effect by locking people in a small room with
someone who won't stop screaming for two hours. &QL; 
---The film: ``The Cell'' (R; violence, nudity, language, drug use,

 &HT;    Ohioan goes from teaching to being Cowboys' placekicker
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas - Tim Seder gave up nearly everything in
his personal and professional life to become the Dallas Cowboys'
placekicker.
</P>
<P>
   Seder quit his teaching job in Ohio, indefinitely left his wife,
traveled 1,000 miles to a new city, rented a studio apartment,
found a roommate and kicked a football until the Cowboys were
satisfied they had their man.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Seder was a three-sport coach at Lucas High School in
Mansfield, Ohio. When he returned home from basketball practice one
day in the dead of winter, his life took a dramatic change.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I walked in the house, my wife said I'd better listen to
the answering machine,'' Seder said Wednesday during a break at
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   The call was from Steve Hoffman, kicking coach for the Cowboys.
There was a job opening in Dallas, and Hoffman wanted the
25-year-old teacher to apply. The salary and perks were good ...
but there was a catch.
</P>
<P>
   Seder's chances of making the squad were about 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Seder temporarily kissed his wife Melissa goodbye and followed
his dream of playing in the NFL. Who would have figured that
someone from tiny Ashland University who had not played competitive
football in three years would be offered that type of a deal?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not Seder.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the NFL was concerned, I never thought I'd have a
shot to kick,'' Seder said. ``I thought I was going to be coaching,
and I was striving to become better at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Seder's first tryout for Hoffman was memorable. Seder walked
into Texas Stadium with old soccer shoes that had holes on the
sides. When Hoffman asked him about his style of footwear, Seder
quietly said, ``That's all I got, coach.''
</P>
<P>
   When Seder's first kicked missed badly, Hoffman rolled his eyes,
wondering how he could make such a mistake. Seder responded by
nailing several in a row, all with tremendous height and distance.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman's hunch about Seder was starting to look good.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Cowboys called, Seder had never sniffed an NFL team.
He was not drafted after finishing college three years ago. He was
never a free agent. No team gave him much thought until Hoffman did
some research.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman, the NFL's only full-time kicking coach, was sorting
through a stack of nearly 200 videos when he came across a dark and
grainy tape of Seder kicking a football in a high school gym.
Former Ashland assistant coach Dave Jaumotte, now with the Detroit
Lions, told Hoffman at the 1998 NFL combine in Indianapolis that he
knew of a kicker _ Seder _ with great potential.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman contacted Seder and requested a tape. Seder's kicking
technique was good, Hoffman recalled, but the Cowboys were already
satisfied with thestack with dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman laughs when he talks about the tapes he receives almost
daily. He has tapes of kickers from Arizona State, Washington and
Michigan, not to mention England and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman's favorite came from a man who attempted 50-yard field
goals on a rainy afternoon. The kicker's young sons chased the
footballs. The ball always landed short o tape no longer is part of
Hoffman's stack.
</P>
<P>
   Seder's story is important because the Cowboys entered training
camp without an experienced kicker on their roster. After two good
years, Cunningham lost his accuracy _ and his confidence _ midway
through the 1999 season. Veteran Eddie Murray finished the season,
but the Cowboys began to search for a young kicker who would make
themp in April, earning himself a spot on the summer roster, and be
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Seder credits Hoffman for his early success with the Cowboys.
Among his adjustments, Seder has removed a ``hop-step'' on his
kicking approach to provide better balance.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman and Coach Dave Campo said Seder's ability is matched
only by his confidence. He has made three of four field goals
duringthe job by outkicking Lindell in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the hard part. Nothing really matters until the Sept.
3 opener againstio,'' Campo said. ``He knows he will be under
scrutiny. He has two more (preseason) games to get ready for the
regular season.''
</P>
<P>
   As Seder learned early, all it takes is a phone call to get _ or
lose _ a job. If he fails, the Cowboys will look for anoth Scott
Blanton and Chris Boniol.
</P>
<P>
   If Seder pans out, it will be another Hoffman discovery. The
coach has a knack for finding obscure kickers who become amazingly
accurate under his guidance.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of the Cowboys' theory that kickers should never
be high-priced players. Hoffman must find hidden gems, give them
some polish and save the franchise money by staying away ``If we're
going to sign a kicker that's going to be here for 10 years, why
would (team owner) Jerry Jones want me around?'' Hoffman said. ``If
we sign Morten Andersen, I'm out of a job.''

   ATHENS, Ga. - Having spent the past year battling the University
of Georgia, Aimee Bogrow is thrilled to be living in a residence
hall, looking forward to studying elementary Japanese and planning
on getting football tickets for her dad, a UGA alum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any ill feelings toward the university and don't
want there to be any grudges,'' she said. ``My intention is to go
to school and enjoy my classes. The race issue is now demolished,
and I won one for the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bogrow, 19, was one of three women who sued UGA, saying that its
admissions policies were unconstitutionally discriminatory because
they provided preferences to male and African-American applicants.
</P>
<P>
   In July, U.S. District Court Judge B. Avant Edenfield ruled that
UGA's use of race in admissions decisions was discriminatory, a
decision the university is appealing. On Tuesday, President Michael
Adams announced that UGA would suspend the use of race as a factor
in borderline admissions cases until the appeal is settled.
</P>
<P>
   Gender was removed as an admissions factor last year.
</P>
<P>
   Along with plaintiffs Jennifer Johnson and Molly Ann
Beckenhauer, Bogrow was sent a letter of acceptance a few weeks
ago. Johnson had already planned to attend Mercer University in the
fall but intends to come to Athens for spring semester. Like
Bogrow, Beckenhauer will start classes today, the first day of fall
semester, said Lee Parks, the women's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Bogrow said she never expected to have such a role. She said had
been taught to stand up for herself and others, but hadn't thought
of joining a lawsuit against the state's largest university.
</P>
<P>
   She thought that if she followed her mother's advice and made
herself academically attractive, by making good grades at North
Springs High, by doing well on the SAT and by playing in school
bands, that she would go to UGA, as both parents did. But she
wasn't accepted initially, and her disappointment was almost
devastating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept thinking, where did I screw up?'' she said. ``Who
thinks about admissions policies, and exactly how they work? As the
lawsuit grew, I realized that the admissions standards weren't
right in the first place, and that even if I was admitted, I
wouldn't drop the suit until they dropped the race issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Bogrow found a job at MediaPlay and took 15 hours of classes at
Georgia Perimeter College. Denied admission to UGA for fall 1999,
she hoped to be heading to Athens in January 2000, but as the weeks
passed she knew her education would be delayed longer. At UGA, she
hopes to find a major appropriate for a career in law, an interest
she said has strengthened over the past few months. It's been a
valuable time for her, she said, teaching her ``that two or three
people can really make a difference in how the world is run.''

ARAFAT ANNOUNCES RETHINKING OF PLAN TO DECLARE PALESTINIAN STATE
NEXT MONTH 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, said on
Wednesday that the Palestinian leadership was ``reassessing'' its
plan to make a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state on
Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   That raised the possibility that the Palestinians will not,
after all, take a step that Israel has said would end all prospects
for an early peace agreement between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat made his remarks in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital,
where he stopped on a three-week tour of more than 20 Arab,
European and Asian nations that he began after the Camp David talks
failed last month. After a meeting with the Indonesian president,
Abdurrahman Wahid, Arafat said that the Palestinian leadership
would make a decision on the statehood declaration ``at the
beginning of next month,'' when a Palestinian umbrella group
controlled by Arafat, the Palestine Central Council, is to meet in
the Gaza Strip
</P>
<P>
   Although Arafat declined to say what the decision was likely to
be, his remarks were in keeping with reports from Western diplomats
in contact with the Palestinian leadership, who have said in recent
days that Arafat was on the verge of deferring the statehood
pronouncement, perhaps until November or later.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian leader hinted as much when he returned last
weekend from visits to Russia and other European states, and said
that he had failed to round up international backing for an early
statehood declaration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are reassessing this,'' Arafat said on Wednesday, after his
meeting with Wahid at Indonesia's presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
   But he stopped short of stating that the declaration would
definitely be deferred, saying that the Palestinians had received
letters from the Clinton administration and from the European
Union, promising that renewed negotiations on a peace pact would
aim at reaching a final agreement before Sept. 13, the anniversary
of the 1993 Oslo accords that launched the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the accords was to reach a final agreement within
seven years that would settle contentious issues like Jerusalem,
and seal a mutual recognition by Israel and a Palestinian state of
each others' sovereignty and borders.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli newspapers have taken two views of the Palestinian
maneuvering. Some contend that Arafat is retreating from the
September date, bruised from the response on his travels. However,
another view that has gained ground is that he may privately
welcome the opportunity to maneuver himself out of the commitment
by blaming the lack of international support.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli leader, Prime Minister Ehud Barak, had warned
repeatedly that Israel would retaliate if the Palestinians
pre-empted a final peace agreement by formally proclaiming a state.
Barak and his top officials have said that one likely option would
be to counter the Palestinian move with the formal annexation of
145 Jewish settlements on the West Bank _ a key issue in the peace
talks _ as Israeli sovereign territory.
</P>
<P>
   Any such sequence would be likely to test to the breaking point
the relative calm that has prevailed between Israelis and
Palestinians in recent times, particularly in the volatile areas
around the Jewish settlements and in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Camp David negotiations collapsed last month,
primarily because of disagreements over Jerusalem, Israeli and
Palestinian officials have pointed to the absence of serious armed
clashes as a sign of the two sides' ability to work together, and
to maintain an atmosphere conducive to renewed negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Officials on both sides insisted again on Wednesday that they
would not compromise on their claims to East Jerusalem, but moves
towards a resumption of full-scale peace talks continued to gather
speed. For the first time since the Camp David talks, teams of
senior officials from the two sides met for what were described as
substantive exchanges on Jerusalem and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli team was led by Shlomo Ben-Ami, the acting foreign
minister, and by Gilad Sher, an aide to Barak. The Palestinian side
was led by Saeb Erekat and Mohammed Dahlan, senior aides to Arafat
who accompanied him to Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Before the talks, Ben-Ami sought to dampen suggestions that a
new summit meeting between Barak and Arafat could occur soon,
possibly as early as mid-September. Speculation had been spurred
earlier in the day by an announcement from Washington that Dennis
Ross, the American official who has frequently shuttled between the
two sides in his capacity as the State Department's special peace
envoy, would arrive in Israel on Thursday, several days earlier
than previously announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We mustn't raise our expectations too high because the issues
are very, very difficult,'' Ben-Ami said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The public mood ahead of the Ross talks was soured, at least
temporarily, by an incident in the early hours of Wednesday in
which Israeli troops shot and killed a 72-year-old Palestinian man
in a fusillade in Surda, a Palestinian village north of the West
Bank town of Ramallah. According to Israeli and Palestinian
accounts that were broadly similar, the victim, Mahmoud Abdullah,
who held U.S. citizenship, drew fire from an Israeli patrol when he
shot at the soldiers with a pistol from his rooftop.
</P>
<P>
   He died later after the Israeli troops, fearing further attacks,
held back Palestinian and Israeli medics from reaching the victim
for what family members said was at least an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Family members, including one of the victim's sons, Hisham
Abdullah, said that the elder Abdullah appeared to have gone to the
roof at about 3 a.m. fearing that noises he had heard outside
signaled a burglary attempt. Hisham Abdullah, who is employed as a
reporter by the Agence France-Presse news agency in Jerusalem, said
his father had called out ``Who's there?'' before apparently firing
a shot into the dark. The Israelis' return fire, which left the
Abdullahs' house pitted with bullet holes, struck Mahmoud Abdullah
in the head.
</P>
<P>
   The incident dominated radio and television broadcasts in
Israeli and in Palestinian-controlled areas for much of the day,
but did not lead to any immediate disturbances. Controversy over
the incident centered on the Israeli decision to open fire, which
was described as ``murder'' by the Palestinian communications
minister, Immad Falouji, who rushed to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   But an Israeli commander, Col. Gal Hirsch, said Israeli
investigators remained unconvinced about the Abdullah brothers'
account of why their father had opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still haven't got a clue as to what induced him to act in
this way,'' he said. ``But he fired, and when we're fired upon we
return fire and hit.''

LITTLE MORE THAN A BIG ASSAULT

<P>
   The folks who made ``The Cell'' _ screenwriter Mark Protosevich
and Tarsem Singh, an award-winning TV ad director whose music
videos include REM's ``Losing My Religion'' _ claim that they were
out to take the next step beyond ``Silence of the Lambs'' with this
serial killer mindtrip.
</P>
<P>
   What they've come up with is more like the evil stepsister of
``What Dreams May Come,'' an over-the-top collection of
art-directed, superficially surreal images that impart sadistic
wish-dreams rather than New Agey muddle hugs. It's imaginatively
designed, undeniably, but with all the aesthetic taste of a fetish
fashion show _ and less heart.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Lopez wears many strange costumes, extreme makeup and a
grave demeanor as child psychologist Catherine Deane. She's
involved in a long-running, high-tech experiment to reach into the
shut-down brain of a young coma victim _ whose parents just happen
to be as rich as Microsoft, but who are growing tired of
bankrolling the slow process to revive their son.
</P>
<P>
   This involves Catherine's entering the kid's mindscape, trying
to gain his trust, then theoretically leading him out of his inner
prison, which looks like the Sahara, only with derelict ships. The
apparatus that enables this effort suspends Catherine and the boy
in a sealed chamber, clad in rubberized, circuitry-loaded
jumpsuits, where she's electro-chemically put into her own deep
sleep state in order to dream her way into his.
</P>
<P>
   If you think that sounds kinky, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Somewhere in the adjacent desert, a complete whacko named Carl
(Vincent D'Onofrio) is kidnapping young women, sealing them in a
hidden kind of fishbowl cell and videotaping their terror as the
chamber automatically fills to the top with water. He retrieves
said tapes for later self-pleasuring (the metal rings pierced into
his back also play a part in this lovely ritual) and bleaches the
drowned corpses to look like dolls before dumping them in
convenient arroyos.
</P>
<P>
   And if you think that's sick ... obsessive FBI investigator
Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) tracks Carl down, but not before the
murderer suffers a brain seizure. The only hope of finding his
latest victim before she's automatically submerged is to send
Catherine into the dormant lunatic's mind. This is, as you might
imagine, potentially dangerous for the visitor's psyche, too,
seeing as how Carl's head is filled with horse-dissecting systems,
medieval torture methods and memories of his own twisted child
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, the clock is ticking ...
</P>
<P>
   Tarsem, as the director prefers to be called, rotates his
frames, step-cuts his montage, tosses in vulgarized ``2001'' light
shows, switches film stocks willy nilly and distorts sound like
crazy, and those are among the more sober tricks he employs to
remind us that we're in a crazy dreamscape where anything can
happen and, as characters keep reminding one another, ``nothing is
real.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, but a lot of it is really disgusting. Tarsem and his
crew have genuinely grotesque imaginations, and the horrors
depicted in ``The Cell'' are as unpleasant to watch as anything
modern cinema has unleashed. Perhaps because they're wrapped up in
such a hokey, sci-fi/fantasy context, the graphic mortifications
lack the soul-chilling charge similarly upsetting scenes lent to
films such as ``Lambs'' and ``Seven.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, those pictures were made by movie directors, who knew
something about how much to show and what to leave to a viewer's
spiked imagination. Straight as he comes from the ad world, Tarsem,
whatever his gifts for composing a scene, has not yet learned that
throwing everything he's got in someone's face isn't necessarily
the most effective visual storytelling strategy.
</P>
<P>
   And even when the stuff he's hurling isn't designed to make you
hurl, it's still overwrought imagery with no variation in volume
control. When every shot in a movie is meant to wow you, none of
them really does the job. A lot of work went into making ``The
Cell'' a state-of-the-art sensory assault, but you'd get
essentially the same effect by locking people in a small room with
someone who won't stop screaming for two hours. &QL;

NOT ORIGINAL, BUT STILL THE KINGS

(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars

<P>
   Much has been made of the popularity of movies starring
African-American comedians this summer. But the success of such
witless vulgarities as ``Big Momma's House,'' ``Scary Movie'' and
``Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'' probably has far more to do with
America's love for a good fart joke than it does any mass
acceptance of African-American headliners. Low comedy has always
found a wide audience.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to see a movie featuring black comedians actually
offering funny and intelligent observations about America and race
relations, go see ``The Original Kings of Comedy.'' This concert
film, shot by Spike Lee, shows that the most profitable comedy
concert tour in history (the Kings grossed $37 million last year)
was also one of the funniest.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Kings'' revue stars Steve Harvey, Cedric the Entertainer,
D.L. Hughley and Bernie Mac. Cedric and Harvey star on the WB's
``Steve Harvey Show.'' Hughley headlines UPN's ``The Hughleys.''
But don't hold their iffy sitcom backgrounds against these guys.
They are masterful performers, superb storytellers and keen _
although not always particularly insightful _ observers of popular
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey is the MC of the show, coming on first and then during
the intervals between comics. He has many of the movie's best
moments, including riffs on why black audiences didn't respond to
``Titanic'' and a classic baiting of an audience member who had
left his seat before the intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey's best material takes hip-hop music to task, for reasons
both innocuous (the distorted sound) and profound (lyrics filled
with misogyny and violence). Why, Harvey asks, did the Temptations,
despite their involved dance chorography, need just one microphone,
while rappers have 40 people on stage, each with a mike? And why
does anyone want to hear about blood-soaked T-shirts, when back in
the day of Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire and the Ohio Players, T-shirts would
be wet from sexual healing?
</P>
<P>
   Cedric, Harvey's television co-star, is a gifted physical
comedian, able to throw his barrel-chested frame into break-dancing
moves and deftly imitate the exaggerated ways different
neighborhood types smoke cigarettes. Cedric, like Harvey, is
decidedly old-school; his material has a graciousness and geniality
that's absent from so much of the bile that passes for comedy these
days.
</P>
<P>
   The other two headliners _ Hughley and Bernie Mac _ have plenty
of bite, though, particularly Mac, who often excuses his explosive
rants, stating, ``I'm saying what you're scared of saying.'' His
routine uses the ``MF'' expletive more often than a Samuel L.
Jackson movie. (At one point, Mac even breaks down the word,
explaining its usefulness in conversation.)
</P>
<P>
   Mac's edgy humor is most reminiscent of Richard Pryor and the
young Eddie Murphy, whose style (and concert films) obviously
inspired all these guys to some extent. Hughley is a little more
accessible, scoring best when explaining why black people usually
can't afford to be anorexic and have no need for extreme sports
like bungee jumping.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's too much like a lynching for us,'' Hughley says.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, making his third documentary and second concert film,
captures the excitement of the setting and the thrill the audience
members derive from both the performers and their own, oversized
reactions. There are a few backstage moments, but mostly this movie
is about the jokes, which come fast and furious. That most of them
are funny makes ``The Original Kings of Comedy'' one of the bright
spots of a pretty dull summer. &QL;

BRITISH TELECOM EXPECTED TO RAISE STAKE IN GERMAN CONCERN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British Telecommunications PLC is expected to announce
Thursday that it will take control of Viag Interkom, a German
telephone company, by doubling its ownership stake to 90 percent in
a deal worth about 6 billion euros ($5.46 billion), according to
executives close to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The move is part of British Telecom's increasing desire to take
controlling interests in its investments rather than minority
positions. British Telecom currently holds a 45 percent interest in
Viag Interkom.
</P>
<P>
   According to the executives, British Telecom, Britain's biggest
telephone company, agreed in principle Wednesday to the buyout of
Viag Interkom's other major shareholder, E.On AG, a German energy
concern, which also holds a 45 percent stake in the German
telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   Telenor AS, a Norwegian telephone company, owns the remaining 10
percent of Viag Interkom.
</P>
<P>
   While many formerly state-owned European telephone operators
like Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom have been on an aggressive
path recently by making prominent acquisitions _ Deutsche Telekom
has a deal to acquire VoiceStream Wireless of the United States for
$50 billion and France Telecom bought Orange PLC of Britain for
$37.5 billion _ British Telecom has clearly remained in the
background, plotting its next move with what some would call
English reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Though British Telecom's buyout of Viag Interkom is somewhat
prosaic by the standards set by its acquisitive European rivals,
the deal is an important step in the British telephone operator's
quest to create a pan-European footprint and gain a foothold in
Germany, one of the biggest markets for telecommunications,
particularly for wireless services.
</P>
<P>
   Viag Interkom is the third largest telephone operator in
Germany, controlling a fixed line network as well as a wireless
network. Viag Interkom's real attraction is its wireless network,
which has more than 2 million subscribers. While the wireless unit,
called E2, is small in comparison to its competitors _ it ranks as
the fourth largest _ it is one of the last available avenues into
the mobile telephone market in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Viag Interkom is currently in the midst of Germany's high-stakes
auction to win a third generation mobile telephone license that
will allow it to offer fast wireless data services. Like the
auction in Britain, which cost telephone operators here $35.5
billion in total, Germany's auction is also testing the wills and
pocketbooks of the bidders by reaching even loftier bidding
heights.
</P>
<P>
   Now the bid totals in Germany reached 47.7 billion euros, or
about $43.4 billion. The bids are seen as a bellwether for similar
auctions to be conducted in the future in both Europe and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Viag Interkom's most recent bid is for about 7.9 billion
Deutsche marks, or about $3.7 billion at current exchange rates. It
is crucial for British Telecom that Viag Interkom secure a license
so that it will be able to offer seamless third generation services
across all of the networks it owns to compete with the likes of
Vodafone Airtouch PLC, the world's largest mobile telephone
company.
</P>
<P>
   Viag Interkom's chairman, Maximilian Ardelt, said recently he
was certain that the company would win a license in the German
auctions, which are expected to end shortly.
</P>
<P>
   For E.On, which was created by the merger between the two German
utility companies Veba and Viag, the deal fits its strategy of
selling assets that are beyond its core business, allowing it to
focus more closely on its traditional strength, power generation
and energy.

U.S. FOREST SERVICE SCRAMBLES TO FIND ENOUGH FIREFIGHTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Its bureaucracy stretched thin by the burdens of
battling wildfires scorching the West, the U.S. Forest Service has
begun bringing back retired workers, hiring employees' spouses and
taking other unusual steps to increase the number of people
available to fight the fires.
</P>
<P>
   The measures underscore longstanding concerns that the agency
does not have enough trained staff to handle a summer with severe
and widespread forest fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the inherent depth for fire seasons like this
one now,'' said Harry Croft, deputy director at the fire and
aviation management division of the forest service. ``We need a
massive injection of new people into this organization, or in 10
years, we are going to be sucking swamp water.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael P. Dombeck, chief of the Forest Service, sent a
memorandum to staff members in late July encouraging them to lend a
hand with the firefighting efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are experiencing shortages in virtually every incident
management position,'' Dombeck wrote, reminding his staff that ``we
all have roles and responsibilities during fire emergencies.''
</P>
<P>
   All Forest Service employees, regardless of job description, are
encouraged to undergo training so they can help fight fires, often
in a management or administrative capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The agency was unable to provide an estimate of the number of
staff members who have volunteered.
</P>
<P>
   Since the distribution of the memorandum, the fires have
significantly worsened, and the agency is scrambling to get enough
people into the field. In addition to encouraging administrative,
management and other office workers to abandon their desks for the
field, the agency is hiring retired employees, the spouses of
current ones and people who live near the fires.
</P>
<P>
   Retired workers often have skills that are in short supply,
Croft said. They can, for example, manage the money and paperwork
needed to pay contract workers hired at fire sites, and they can
make sure equipment is properly cared for and effectively deployed,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other workers are needed for jobs like driving trucks, providing
food and directing traffic near the fires.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service, a branch of the Agriculture Department, has
been criticized for much of the last decade for not having enough
employees trained to fight fires. In 1994, after one of the most
severe fire seasons in history, the agency set the goal of
``preparing 75 percent of its work force to be trained, qualified
and available to support fire emergencies by the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   That goal proved too ambitious; the agency estimates that only
about 50 percent of its staff is properly trained now.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, reported in August that if more Forest Service employees
were not trained, the service's ability to fight fires would be
greatly compromised. The GAO recommended making it a requirement
that ``all employees become qualified, in some manner, to
contribute to fighting fires.''
</P>
<P>
   But Croft said that was not practical because the agency had
evolved, and specialization of the work force was now necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Another report, released in January and commissioned by Dombeck,
said that the agency's ability to adequately fight large fires was
``diminishing'' because of significant changes in its work force.
Those changes include a shrinking services staff, a reduced
willingness among employees to ``support emergency fire efforts
occurring away from their assigned locations'' and the perception
that ``active fire participation is not career enhancing.''
</P>
<P>
   The best way to solve the current staffing problems, the report
said, is to create a national organization dedicated exclusively to
fighting large wildfires. That would mean abandoning the tradition
of encouraging all employees to be trained to fight fires.
</P>
<P>
   Croft, who endorsed the recommendation, said that times had
changed. ``We can no longer rely on people's good will to fight
these fires,'' he said.

FEDERAL OFFICIAL FOR RESEARCH ETHICS SIGNALS TOUGHER GUIDELINES 
</HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP J. HILTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. _ The chief federal official overseeing the safety
and ethics of experiments with human subjects said Wednesday that
conflicts of interest in medical research were so troublesome that
``the system may have gotten entirely out of control'' and might
have to be reorganized.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks by the official, Dr. Greg Koski, director-designate
of the Office for Human Research Protections, concluded a two-day
government-sponsored conference here on conflicts of interest in
medical research. Speakers at the conference presented evidence
that questionable financial ties between industry and researchers
who test drugs or medical devices were more widespread than
previously believed.
</P>
<P>
   These were Koski's first public remarks since his appointment by
Donna Shalala, secretary of health and human services. They were
particularly significant because his predecessor, Gary Ellis, was
removed from office after shutting down human-experimentation
programs at a series of major universities and medical centers for
violations of federal ethics rules.
</P>
<P>
   Patient-advocacy groups have speculated that Koski was put in
the job to take a softer line.
</P>
<P>
   But his comments Wednesday signaled, if anything, a tougher
stance. He said confidence in researchers to conduct human
experiments had so eroded ``that we must take steps to re-establish
the public's trust in the goodness of our endeavors.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems pointed out by critics of the current ethics
system, he said, are ``very real, very serious and a threat to our
entire endeavor.''
</P>
<P>
   Koski, a cardiac anesthesiologist at Harvard University and
Massachusetts General Hospital, said he would not offer specific
proposals until after he takes office in September. But in response
to a challenge here from Marcia Angell, former editor of The New
England Journal of Medicine, he did say that researchers should not
conduct studies on products of companies in which they own shares.
Such arrangements are currently allowed, and even encouraged by
many universities, which also frequently have a financial interest
in the company, and so stand to profit if the tested product proves
successful.
</P>
<P>
   Koski said he had been thinking hard about ways to reorganize
the ethics system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not be possible to drive that old Edsel much farther,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of the eight major universities and hospitals
whose research has been shut down for ethics violations, including
failure to fully disclose to the experiments' subjects the risks
they faced, Koski said anyone who did not comply with ethics rules
was showing a lack of regard for the patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compliance,'' he said, ``is one way we demonstrate our respect
for the subjects. And failure to comply is a symptom of an
institution's unwillingness to accept responsibility'' in its work.
</P>
<P>
   Koski paused in his remarks to emphasize that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make it unmistakably clear,'' he said, ``that
institutions and individuals who fail to accept this responsibility
should not be permitted to engage in this endeavor'' of human
experimentation. One reason, Koski said, is that when one
institution so fails, the entire research enterprise suffers with
the stigma.
</P>
<P>
   But Koski said his goal would be more than mere compliance with
current standards, adding that he wanted to urge research centers
to work at ``the highest standard of ethical responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   He lauded the American Society of Gene Therapy for ``just saying
no'' with its recently established policy that researchers should
be free of significant financial involvement with the companies
that sponsor their studies. He challenged other academic and
industry groups, specifically the Biotechnology Industry
Organization, to make similar declarations on financial conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Koski said he would use the information from the conference here
to start formulating a new conflict-of-interest policy for the
government. He said disclosure of a scientist's conflict, as is
currently required, would no longer be enough; new restrictions
will be necessary, he maintained.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine if a right-wing pundit such as Rush Limbaugh went on
network television and delivered a tasteless visual joke about Al
Gore _ something that would cross anybody's boundary of fair play.
</P>
<P>
   Something like showing a photo of Gore at the podium at the
Democratic National Convention along with a flashing graphic
proclaiming, ``SNIPERS WANTED.''
</P>
<P>
   Gee, you think ol' Rush would take some heavy heat for that? You
think the liberal pundits (like me) would be typing so vigorously
on their keyboards they'd be in danger of erasing their own
fingerprints?
</P>
<P>
   Molly Ivins would sprain her sense of humor. Al Franken would
fracture his funnybone. Maureen Dowd would try to figure out a way
to make a reference to ``Big Brother'' or Harry Potter.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Democratic officials would be calling press
conferences to demand Limbaugh's resignation, and special-interest
groups would be organizing boycotts of his sponsors and protests
outside his broadcast facility. Some politician would even be
asking the Secret Service and the FBI to investigate whether
Limbaugh could be brought up on charges for encouraging the
assassination of a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   And you know what? At least some of that reaction would be
justified. Any would-be comedian who would broadcast such a
``joke'' in our assassination-saturated times is the kind of
intellectual who would have to take night courses just to upgrade
himself to idiot status.
</P>
<P>
   Let's leave that hornet's nest unattended for a moment. In
hypothetical scenario No. 2, we'll envision Dr. Laura Schlessinger
as the one making an incendiary comment. Picture Dr. Laura going on
the radio or her upcoming TV show and making a juvenile joke about
Dick Cheney's lesbian daughter, e.g., ``Apparently she loves
Bush.'' How long would it take gay-rights groups to pounce on that?
The anti-Schlessinger web sites would be pulsating and the press
releases would be mass-faxed within hours, if not minutes, of such
an incident.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, imagine if a broadcaster with conservative stripes _
say, Ann Coulter _ did a late-night TV appearance and offered her
take on the selection of Joseph Lieberman as Gore's running mate
with this monologue:
</P>
<P>
   ``This Gore-Lieberman ticket is working because Bush, you know
... he had a 19-point lead the other day. It is now down to 2
percent. Wow. Whatever. But this is the first time in history a Jew
has knocked 80 percent off.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoa. Coulter would be ripped for a crack like that, wouldn't
she? And rightfully so, it's a rotten joke.
</P>
<P>
   I think we can all agree that Limbaugh, Schlessinger and
Coulter, had they made the comments outlined above, would have been
creamed by the media and by liberal-leaning politicos. Subjected to
day after day of sharp and stinging rebukes. Ripped like John
Rocker was ripped.
</P>
<P>
   But let's make it perfectly clear that Limbaugh didn't do the
assassination joke, and Schlessinger didn't go for the cheap laugh
at Cheney's daughter's expense, and Coulter did not utter the
anti-Semitic remarks.
</P>
<P>
   It was Craig Kilborn who did the ``SNIPERS WANTED'' gag _ only
it was George Bush who was the subject of the ill-advised attempt
at humor, not Al Gore. And it was Bill Maher who did the jokes
about Cheney and Lieberman, on ``Politically Incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   So where's the outrage? Where are the scathing columns and the
calls for suspensions? Could it be that many of the liberal
commentators and politicians whom we'd expect to be so offended by
such comments are offended only when it serves their agendas?
</P>
<P>
   Look, I'm often the first to chortle at tasteless, mean, even
sick humor _ so I'm not about to say these guys should be banished
from the airwaves over their admittedly regrettable stabs at humor.
(Although Kilborn's pathetic gag probably should result in a
weeklong suspension _ something that would be considered a favor by
any viewer who isn't into smarmy narcissism anyway.) Their comments
didn't shock me, nor did they rattle my own value system. I'm
content to call Kilborn a clueless jerk and say the normally witty
Maher should have known better, and leave it at that _ but what
intrigues me is the near-total silence from the media and the
activists and the elected officials about these two incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Usually I snort at conservatives who write and call to complain
about the hypocrisy of liberals and moderates _ who say we're much
quicker to jump on someone's remarks if that person happens to be a
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   This time I'd say they're right.

CYBERSPACE CAMPING COULD LEAD TO OUTDOOR ADVENTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS COCOLES  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Want to know how to noodle a catfish? Does
spending a week snow camping sound like a cool way to forget about
the summer heat? Interested in joining the Christian Deer Hunter's
Association?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not. But if you're in search of outdoor adventure - from
the bizarre to the more traditional - look no further than
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem ironic that you can learn a lot about activities
that actually require you to leave the chair in front of your
computer and go outside, but you'd be surprised what you can find
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   I recently took such an odyssey through the Internet, and was
exposed to these valuable morsels: building the perfect igloo; the
gospel according to rock star/bowhunter Ted Nugent on his United
Sportsmen of America Web site; the art of kicksledding (It's a
Finnish snow sport touted as a ``physical activity for the
millennium.'')
</P>
<P>
   And I never once got sunburned, seasick or stung by mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   But I did find some intriguing and informative Web sites for
those wanting to experience the great outdoors as a novice or
veteran. Here are some of the best:
</P>
<P>
   The river wild: Whitewater rafting fans should check out
California Creekin' (www.creekin.net).
</P>
<P>
   River rafting has a lot of class to it. A river's dangerous
waters are ranked from Class I (being the tamest) to Class V (for
experts only).
</P>
<P>
   California Creekin' is the perfect site to check a river and
make sure a run is the right one for your trip. The Kern River
(Class II-III), from Kern Powerhouse No.3 to Isabella Reservoir
east of Bakersfield, is one of the close-to-L.A. trips highlighted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best training run in Southern California,'' says
the description of the 2- to 4-mile (one-hour-or-longer) journey.
``There are many campgrounds along the north fork Kern, and many
nearby motels if you prefer not to rough it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone fishing: California's fishing options are as diverse as the
state itself. A good place to find out why is www.calfishing.com.
</P>
<P>
   Don't have a boat? Check out the site's salute to float tubing,
``the poor kid's way of getting out on the water.''
</P>
<P>
   The Barni Zone should not be missed for any angler with a sense
of humor, though an introduction warns: ``Some anglers may become
offended by the remarks made in this section, but nothing is meant
to be personally demeaning.''
</P>
<P>
   The site's message board offers information on where the big
ones are biting.
</P>
<P>
   Go climb a rock: If you don't have a fear of heights, log on to
www.vertical-adventures.com for the thrill of a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Vertical Adventures Rock Climbing School offers courses
year-around, ranging from one-day classes to multi-day seminars to
advanced courses that focus on rescue techniques.
</P>
<P>
   If the name of the peak doesn't scare you, the Idyllwild Rock
Climbing School is offering classes and guided climbs up
!ital!Suicide Rock!off! in the San Jacinto Mountains through
August.
</P>
<P>
   Wild thing: L.A. Wild (lawild.rivals.com) is the quintessential
site for a weekend of exploring without having to drive far.
</P>
<P>
   Among the trips featured: hiking to the summit of Mount
Baden-Powell in the San Gabriel Mountains and sportfishing off the
Baja coast.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site's motto is ``Explore The Limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Girl power: For those who think handling worms is just a guy
thing, try Women's Fishing Online (womensfishing.rivals.com).
</P>
<P>
   One of the gems of this site is a section titled Meditations on
Fishing and Life, a tribute to what fishing means from the female
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people read for relaxation. A lot of people love to
swim. A lot of people (love) to travel,'' writes one woman from
Missouri. ``I love to fish. ... I've heard that every time you
fish, you add seven years to your life.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also Women's Hunting Online
(www.womenshunting.rivals.com).
</P>
<P>
   Shop till you drop: Check your credit card limit before logging
on because the Bass Pro Shops' online store (www.basspro.com) is
Toys R Us for adults.

MARKET PLACE: AS OIL RISES, PLEADING EYES TURN TO SAUDIS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The price of crude oil increased again Wednesday, even after an
American Petroleum Institute report the day before said that
inventories rose by an unexpected 7.4 million barrels last week and
the federal Energy Information Agency cited a smaller but still
strong increase of 3.4 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   The price jump, with oil for September delivery up 13 cents, to
$31.80 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, pretty much
sums up the current outlook for oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   With inventories in the United States still near 24-year lows,
the hope for price relief is in another significant rise in output
by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. And that
boils down to OPEC's approving increased production from Saudi
Arabia _ or Saudi Arabia going it alone. The group's next meeting
begins early next month.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts think more oil will be pumped because, they say,
OPEC and especially the Saudis do not want to threaten economic
growth by leaving the price above $30 a barrel for the American
crude oil benchmark, West Texas intermediate.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, pressure from the United States on Saudi Arabia and
other suppliers, inside OPEC as well as outside, to produce more
oil will build quickly if the price does not retreat soon. It is
not far from the 9 &UR;  &LR; 1/2-year high of $34.14 a barrel it touched in
March just before OPEC's first production increase.
</P>
<P>
   This week, there have been new rumblings of concern from the
Clinton administration, which lobbied hard for increased OPEC
production before the supplier nations' meeting in June.
</P>
<P>
   It was reported on Monday that Energy Secretary Bill Richardson
had told a group of energy analysts a few days earlier that the
administration was re-examining ways to lend oil to refiners from
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, presumably lowering prices as the
available supplies rose.
</P>
<P>
   Oil will almost certainly be a presidential campaign issue if
the price remains high, especially because of the connections to
the oil industry of the Republican ticket of George W. Bush and
Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Home heating oil prices are already on the rise again. Heating
oil for September delivery rose 0.37 cent a gallon yesterday, to
86.88 cents. It is up 13 percent in the last two and a half weeks
and is 26 percent above the average price from October through
February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think informally or otherwise, there is likely to be a
supply response'' from OPEC before the meeting begins, said Michael
Rothman, senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   But the low inventory situation _ and traders' and speculators'
focus on it _ is leaving the oil market far more vulnerable to
upward price pressure than it was earlier in the year, when OPEC
members debated their first two production increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no shock absorbers,'' said Gary N. Ross, chief
executive of the PIRA Energy Group, ``and we are vulnerable to
price spikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts think that it will be difficult to quickly rebuild
inventories. They say that most OPEC nations cannot increase their
overall capacity to produce oil, providing them little interest in
higher output quotas that benefit only a few. Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates are the only OPEC nations that could produce
significantly more oil, the analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Then last week, the International Energy Agency reported that
several OPEC countries, including the United Arab Emirates, were in
fact producing below their capacity. Rothman quoted the agency's
monthly report for July as saying that the second-quarter inventory
buildup in the 29 members of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, a group of the world's wealthier
nations, had been far less than normal for that time of year.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia seemed to have succeeded in taking the pressure off
oil prices _ and the focus off inventory levels _ when it finally
convinced traders, analysts and speculators last month that it
would produce 500,000 more barrels a day, a promise it first
surprised the oil market with on July 3.
</P>
<P>
   After wrangling within OPEC, the Saudi message got though as its
extra oil began to move. And with that, the price dropped to $27.43
a barrel on July 31 from $30.93 at the beginning of the month.
</P>
<P>
   But on Aug. 1, the American Petroleum Institute reported that
crude oil inventories in the United States had dropped by a
surprising 9 million barrels in the week ending July 28, leaving
inventory more than 40 million barrels below the level of a year
earlier. The following week, total inventory fell by 2.1 million
barrels more, bringing it to a 24-year low of 282.6 million
barrels. The price of crude oil was back above $30 the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's report from the American Petroleum Institute revised
the previous week still lower, so that the 7.4-million-barrel
increase brought inventories for the week ending on Aug. 11 to
286.4 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   The only positive factor in the oil price's remaining above $30
a barrel is that OPEC members have an informal agreement to raise
production by 500,000 barrels a day if prices stay above a set
level for 20 trading days in a row. That level works out to a bit
more than $30 a barrel for West Texas intermediate, and the 20 days
up would be just before an OPEC meeting the second week of
September.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the producers' group could choose to ignore this
trigger. Or, a little jawboning would be enough to push the price
below $30 for a day, starting the 20-day period again. So the
upward bias on oil prices would remain until there were clear
increases in production.

ANGELS HOLD OUT HOPE TO SIGN AUBURN STAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Pitcher Chris Bootcheck, a first-round pick by the
Anaheim Angels in this year's draft, has enrolled for his senior
season at Auburn University, but the club believes he can still be
signed.
</P>
<P>
   It is normal for underclassmen to enroll in school even when
they are drafted. But once Bootcheck attends his first class at
Auburn for his senior year, the Angels will lose their draft rights
to him. Classes at Auburn start in about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bootcheck, the 20th overall pick in the draft, is represented by
agent Scott Boras, who is known as a tough negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is going as we expected it to go,'' Angels general
manager Bill Stoneman said. ``It's SOP (standard operating
procedure) with guys represented by Boras. I'm not saying he will
or will not go to school.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman won't say what offer the Angels have made to Bootcheck.
The No. 19 pick in the draft got $1.65 million and the No. 21 pick
got $1.2 million. There have been reports that the Angels' offer is
around $1.4 million, but Stoneman said, ``The numbers I've seen
thrown around are only speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made a fair offer,'' Stoneman added. ``With respect to
No. 19 and 21, as long as we've been fair with the player, then I'm
comfortable with whatever happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Boras is representing nine players who were selected in the
draft, and so far none have signed. Two of them, including
Bootcheck, are first-round picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not counting,'' Stoneman said of Boras' players. ``I'm
only counting one guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bootcheck, 21, went 9-2 with a 3.76 ERA in 19 starts in his
junior year at Auburn. In his three-year career there, he's 25-10
with a 4.73 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have already signed their top pick, pitcher Joe
Torres, with a $2.1 million bonus. Torres, the 10th overall pick in
the draft, is pitching at Single-A Boise.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad stays hot: Darin Erstad hit his 20th homer of the season
Wednesday, setting a career high. He also became the fifth Angel to
reach the 20-homer mark, joining Troy Glaus (35), Garret Anderson
(31), Mo Vaughn (29) and Tim Salmon (26).
</P>
<P>
   It is the fourth time in Angels history the team has had five
players with at least 20 homers -- 1961 (Earl Averill, Steve Bilko,
Ken Hunt, Lee Thomas and Leon Wagner), '82 (Don Baylor, Doug
DeCinces, Brian Downing, Reggie Jackson and Fred Lynn) and '95
(Chili Davis, Jim Edmonds, Tony Phillips, Salmon and J.T. Snow).
</P>
<P>
   Glaus hit his 35th homer of the season Wednesday. It is the
fifth-highest total in Angels history, behind Reggie Jackson (39 in
1982), Bobby Bonds (37 in 1977), Leon Wagner (37 in 1972) and Don
Baylor (36 in 1979).
</P>
<P>
   Fastballs: Blue Jays closer Billy Koch hit 99 mph on the radar
gun several times in the ninth inning Wednesday. Vaughn took some
big cuts but eventually struck out. What if Vaughn connected with
one of Koch's fastballs?
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had gotten ahold of one it would've had to clear
customs,'' manager Mike Scioscia said. ``You would have had to put
a passport on it.''

   MOSCOW _ Russian naval forces failed again Wednesday to dock a
rescue vehicle onto the sunken and disabled submarine Kursk as
President Vladimir Putin ordered his military commanders to accept
Western offers of assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's call for assistance came as hopes flickered that any of
the 118 crew members, from whom no signal was heard throughout the
day, would be able to cling to life as high winds and stormy seas
crippled rescue efforts in the Barents Sea, in the Arctic Circle.
</P>
<P>
   Britain loaded a rescue submarine into a Russian transport jet
Wednesday afternoon and flew it to Norway, from where it was to be
sent to the rescue site, which is some 35 miles off the Kola
Peninsula, where Russia's Northern Fleet is based. The Russians may
be counting on the British submersible to be more meneuverable in
the harsh tides and more adaptable in its docking mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   At the scene, 22 Russian vessels were hovering in wind-tossed
seas over the heavily damaged and partially flooded hull of the
Kursk, trapped since the weekend 350 below the surface. Norway said
Russia had asked for divers and possibly additional ships to help.
</P>
<P>
   But it seemed unlikely that foreign experts could join the
operation before midday Saturday, and that is a day beyond the
deadline when the crew is likely to be out of breathable air,
according to the estimate made by Russia's navy commander, Adm.
Vladimir Kuroyedov.
</P>
<P>
   Russian navy officials acknowledged in interviews Wednesday that
most of the crew may have perished in the first hours of the
disaster, when an explosion apparently ripped through the forward
compartment of the submarine, sending the 14,000 ton vessel
crashing into the seabed, where it rolled to one side.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday and Tuesday, according to Russian officials, crew
members had been banging on the hull of the vessel, but they said
such signals grew more faint Tuesday and stopped on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk was taking part in large-scale naval maneuvers last
weekend when an underwater explosion was detected by both Russian
surface warships and U.S. and Norwegian intelligence sensors
monitoring the exercises from a distance.
</P>
<P>
   A contingent of senior Northern Fleet officers was aboard the
Kursk, a navy spokesman said, and may have died on the bridge along
with the submarine's captain, Gennadi Lyachin, 45. Navy officials
initially reported the crew size at 116, but said Wednesday that
118 officers and crew were aboard.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Washington, a U.S. defense official said two enormous
explosions in close succession were detected on the Kursk last
weekend in the forward compartments at a time when a torpedo-firing
exercise may have been underway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a pretty good indication of how powerful those
explosions were,'' the official said, adding, ``the magnitude was
extraordinary,'' and would be consistent with torpedo blasts.
</P>
<P>
   He said there was no evidence the Kursk was involved in a
collision and that, based on U.S. estimates, some members of the
crew in the aft sections of the boat may have survived.
</P>
<P>
   Russian navy officials confirmed Wednesday that the Oscar II
class submarine had been equipped with an escape module built into
the conning tower, or sail, and that the module was designed to
separate from the submarine with explosive charges and float the
entire crew to the surface in time of disaster.
</P>
<P>
   However, Russian officials said that apparent damage to the sail
area and possible flooding of the bridge and the compartment under
the sail area may have made access to the escape module impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most Russian navy officials expressed the conviction that
some crew members survived and remain alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the absence of a signal means that all of them
are dead,'' said Rear Adm. Georgi G. Kostov, 72, a long time
commander of nuclear attack submarines and an instructor as
Russia's naval academy. ``What it means is that people are in a
sort of dormant, sleepy state and they can hold on if they had time
to put on warm clothing in the unflooded compartments.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``I think they are very cold. They have food,
they have some lighting. And the oxygen is running out with every
hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin, vacationing at the Black Sea resort of Sochi,
characterized the plight of the crew as ``difficult, and I would
say, critical,'' spoke by telephone with President Clinton for 25
minutes during the day. Clinton reiterated an offer of assistance
and Putin said he was ``actively considering'' such offers, an
administration official said in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, Britain and Norway said they had received
clearance from Russian military authorities to join the rescue
effort. Putin's decision seemed aimed in part to dampen criticism
that the military was not doing enough to save the crew.
</P>
<P>
   As the dramatic and dangerous rescue operation was pelted by
driving rain and sleet, a navy spokesman said that by late
afternoon Wednesday, small rescue submarines working in shifts had
conducted four separate dives attempting to dock on one of the
hatches of the Kursk in hopes that the hatch could be opened and
surviving crew members ferried to the surface. But strong currents,
poor visibility and the treacherous angle caused when the submarine
rolled to one side during the accident have frustrated every
docking attempt, Navy officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the diving sessions, multiple attempts were made to
maneuver the rescue vehicle into position. One vehicle was damaged
during the day, officials said. The first dives on Tuesday also
failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole day was spent on attempts to dock with the
submarine,'' said Navy spokesman Igor Dygalo on Wednesday evening.
``During the last 24 hours, rough seas and a strong northeast wind
resulted more than once in danger of losing a rescue capsule.'' He
added that in one diving session, a rescue vehicle successfully
settled over the rear hatch of the Kursk, but then reported that
its own batteries were running dangerously low and was recalled to
the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Fleet spokesman Igor Babenko said docking attempts
would continue through the night, but he added that ``given the
fruitlessness of the attempts in the day and the worsening weather
conditions, one cannot expect any results before Thursday
morning.'' He added that the navy for now would continue pinning
its hopes on completing a successful docking with the Kursk using
the small rescue submarines and added that Navy officials would
delay other contingency plans, such as trying to float the stern
section of the submarine near to surface using huge pontoons.
</P>
<P>
   Babenko reiterated earlier estimates that ``the stores of oxygen
on the submarine are sufficient for the crew members to move
unaided and maintain physical functions for two more days.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Storm conditions in the Barents Sea were forecast to abate
somewhat in the next two days, with winds reducing from gale force
to 25-35 miles per hours and seas to drop from 10-12 feet to 6-8
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the families of Kursk crew members, some traveling
from distant parts of Russia, began gathering in the Severodmorsk,
where the Northern Fleet command is based near Murmansk to keep a
vigil as the air supplies inside the darkened submarine dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the submarine was so safe,'' said Valentina
Staroseltseva, speaking in an interview in Kursk, the southern
Russian city for which the submarine was named. ``We called it our
submarine. We were 100 percent confident in it. We really believed
in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Galina Belogun, the wife of an officer aboard the stricken
vessel, telephoned a newspaper in Murmansk to pour out her anxiety
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell us to hang on, and we, of course, are hanging on,''
said Belogun. ``Each person comforts himself, but when you turn on
a television it all begins again,'' she added, speaking by
telephone to a newspaper reporter in Murmansk. ``We can no longer
watch the news where they are saying how our men are dying. It is
unbearable.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's airwaves throughout the day were full of frustration
and anger as the navy struggled with one of its worse disasters at
sea. Many criticized the military and Putin's government for
waiting too long to seek foreign assistance with rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Eduard Baltin, a former commander of the Black Sea fleet, and
several former senior officers questioned how the Kursk could have
been conducting torpedo firing exercises in waters so shallow as to
risk a sudden loss of depth from a flooded torpedo tube that would
send the vessel crashing into the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think torpedo shooting at this depth is impermissible,
because it is the minimal depth in which this kind of submarine can
operate,'' said Kostov, who once commanded a division of
November-class attack submarines based on the Kola Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, it is too early to blame anyone,'' he added, ``but it
might be the fault of the fleet commander'' who was supervising the
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Lukin, a vice speaker of the Russian parliament and
former ambassador to the United States, questioned the quality of
information coming from the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am worried by the fact that, according to Western
information, the malfunction occurred on Saturday, and according to
Russian official information, on Sunday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the least understood aspects of the disaster were the
reports of major structural damage to the submarine beyond the
destruction in the forward compartment.
</P>
<P>
   Kuroyedov, the navy commander, said the first examination of the
hull of Kursk showed portions of deck housing torn away. ``The
submarine lies aground with a raised periscope,'' he added,
indicating, some experts said, that the central section of the
submarine was flooded, thus preventing the periscope to
automatically retract.
</P>
<P>
   Other navy officials said the conning tower, where the escape
module was located along with periscopes and antennae, was heavily
damaged. Some officials said it was still possible the submarine
struck a World War II vintage mine, or was involved in a collision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The causes of the accident will become clear following a
detailed examination of the entire submarine body,'' the navy
commander said. And as for the crew, he added, ``We shall remain
optimistic until Aug. 18.''

   MEXICO-CHIAPAS_ From the tropical coast to the Mayan highlands,
the fever for political change _ through ballots, not bullets _ is
sweeping Mexico's Chiapas state. On Sunday, Aug. 20, the state
famous for its armed Zapatista Mayan Indian rebels will elect a new
governor. In the wake of Vicente Fox's historic opposition victory
in last month's presidential election, polls show that change could
be contagious: Even in Indian communities once under tight control
by the ruling party, posters for a Fox ally are up on dirt-floor
homes. An old man wearing a ruling party shirt says he's not so
sure he'll vote for that party now. Chiapans appear to be slightly
favoring Pablo Salazar, a former ruling party member who is now
representing an alliance that includes Fox's conservative National
Action Party and the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party. If
Salazar wins, one of the main reasons for the Zapatistas rising in
protest is eliminated. Mexico's ruling party would be ousted from a
state infamous for its ruling-party corruption and grinding social
inequality. A historic new Fox-Salazar combination would be in
place that could usher in new negotiations with the rebels.

   TWINS _ WHITE PLAINS, N.C. _ To the world and to this day, they
are mostly objects of curiosity _ Chang and Eng, the conjoined
brothers whose May 1811 birth in Siam also spawned the phrase
``Siamese twins.'' But in the northwestern corner of North Carolina
where they settled some 30 years later, they have always been the
Bunker brothers _ hard-working tobacco farmers who married sisters,
fathered 21 children between them and lived utterly ordinary,
small-town lives. Officials recently renamed a bridge after the
twins on the White Plains farm where they lived and are buried.
Still, locals don't quite understand the outside world's
fascination with the twins, which has only grown with the
publication this summer of New Yorker Darin Strauss' acclaimed
novel ``Chang and Eng.'' To the folks who showed up at Strauss'
booksignings last week in nearby Mount Airy and Wilkesboro, and to
the1,000-plus descendants who gathered for one of their

 &HT;    Falcons lose defensive end Smith for exhibition, and perhaps
longer
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. - Falcons starting right defensive end Brady
Smith suffered a deep groin strain in Tuesday's practice that will
keep him out of Friday's preseason game against San Diego, and may
sideline him longer.
</P>
<P>
   The first serious injury of the summer for the Falcons comes at
the team's weakest position.
</P>
<P>
   Starter Patrick Kerney, who's trying to get used to left end
after registering 44 tackles and 2.5 sacks last year while backing
up on both sides as a rookie, will move to right end.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than start a reserve end _ Pellom McDaniels, Emil Ekiyor
or Sam Simmons _ Ed Jasper, who's competing to start at defensive
tackle, will start at left end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because that's where he's worked so far (as opposed to no work
at right end),'' said defensive coordinator Rich Brooks. ``It's to
get him reps. He's done reasonably well there and we want to see
what he does with the No. 1 unit.''
</P>
<P>
   Former starting defensive ends Chuck Smith and Lester
Archambeau, who combined for 15.5 sacks and 140 tackles last
season, were allowed to leave in free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Brady Smith, 27, signed a four-year, $10 million deal to join
the Falcons as a free agent from the Saints. In four seasons with
New Orleans, the 6-foot-5, 270-pounder had 97 tackles and 13 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials believe he is about to blossom. He had 16 starts,
33 tackles and six sacks last season, all career highs.
</P>
<P>
   He's been working in the spot previously held by Chuck Smith,
who last year had 84 tackles and 10 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   McDaniels, 32, is the Falcons' only reserve end with NFL
experience.
</P>
<P>
   He had 29 tackles last year with the Falcons at tackle and end,
but hasn't had a sack since he had 3.5 with the Chiefs in `97.
</P>
<P>
   If team officials make a move, they'll likely wait to see who is
released in the NFL's first roster cutdown on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The free agent pickings are slim.
</P>
<P>
   The top unemployed ends are 34-year-old Neil Smith, released by
Denver after registering 6.5 sacks (and 104.5 in his 12-year
career) in eight starts last season, Ferric Collons, Roy Barker and
Gabe Wilkins.
</P>
<P>
   Collons, 30, is 6-feet-6, 285 pounds and was brought to
Jacksonville in `94 by current Falcons vice president/football
operations Ron Hill. He had two sacks last year with New England.
</P>
<P>
   Barker, 31, is 6-feet-5, 290 pounds and had 12 sacks with the
49ers in `98. But he slipped so badly in Cleveland that he was
released before the end of last season.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins, 28, is 6-feet-5, 308 pounds, but has battled serious
knee problems. He started 15 games last year for the 49ers, with
one sack.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper, 27, began working at left end in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been playing tackle for so long,'' he said, ``that I'm
not used to taking two or three steps to get to somebody.''

<P>
   Children raised in families with stepmothers are likely to have
less health care, less education and less money spent on their food
than children raised by their biological mothers, three studies by
a Princeton economist have found.
</P>
<P>
   The studies examined the care and resources that parents said
they gave to children and did not assess the quality of the
relationships or the parents' feelings and motives.
</P>
<P>
   But experts said that while the findings did not establish the
image of the wicked stepmother as true, they supported the
conclusion that, for complex reasons, stepmothers do invest less in
children than biological mothers do, with fathers, to a large
extent, leaving to women the responsibility for the family's
welfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being raised by the biological mother gives children a lot of
protection,'' said the chief researcher on the studies, Anne Case,
a professor of economics at Princeton. ``It's a very big thing to
ask someone to care for children instead of the birth mother, who,
as the sociobiologists tell us, invests so heavily in carrying the
child, nursing the child.''
</P>
<P>
   The studies took their data from two of the broadest, most
respected surveys of Americans' households, income, spending and
health habits. While those surveys were not created to analyze
stepfamilies, their information is detailed enough to allow
comparisons between different kinds of families.
</P>
<P>
   Among children over 1 year old, living with both biological
parents, the health study found that 61 percent have had a medical
checkup within the last year. But among those living with a
stepmother and birth father, that number dropped to 46 percent _
and of those whose biological mother was dead, only 35 percent had
seen a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Of the children living with their biological parents, 74 percent
wear seat belts almost all the time, compared with 63 percent of
those living with a stepfather and biological mother and 52 percent
of those living with a biological father and stepmother.
</P>
<P>
   Families with a stepmother reported overall household food
spending that was about 5 percent lower for each stepchild than in
families in which both biological parents were present, the food
study found.
</P>
<P>
   In families in which women care for both their stepchildren and
biological children, the biological child, on average, went to
college for a year, while the average stepchild did not go to
college.
</P>
<P>
   Children reared by a stepfather also have lower educational
achievement than those reared by both biological parents, although,
as in most other measures, the negative effect is only about half
as much as with stepmothers.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Frank Furstenberg, a sociologist of the family at the
University of Pennsylvania, said that he did not question the
findings and believed that the studies raised important questions,
but he noted that stepfamilies vary widely.
</P>
<P>
   For example, women who take on a 2-year-old child step into a
role very different from that of women who care for a 12-year-old
stepchild, and for all stepmothers the relationships evolve as the
family becomes better established.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think most stepmothers are evil,'' Furstenberg said.
``If they're less involved, if they take a step back, it may be for
the most noble motives, to give the parent more room, to decrease
the tension. They may be relying on the child's father when perhaps
their trust is unwarranted.''
</P>
<P>
   With more than half the nation's children living apart from at
least one biological parent by the time they reach 18, the
functioning of stepfamilies has become increasingly important. Most
stepfamilies involve stepfathers, rather than stepmothers, and
compared with families in which a single mother is rearing a child
alone, the presence of the stepfather and his income help raise the
family's standard of living.
</P>
<P>
   Still, previous research has shown that children who did not
live with both of their parents had bleaker futures: among other
things, they were more likely to drop out of school, become
delinquents or engage in early sexual activity and drug abuse than
children raised by both parents.
</P>
<P>
   But while those outcomes are well known, there has been almost
no research on the care, attention and resources such children
receive _ and therefore, no way to know whether the damaging
effects reflect poor parenting, family instability, lack of money
or other factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What seemed important to us was looking at the input, which
hasn't really been done,'' Case said. ``For example, on the lower
educational achievement, there was always the question about
whether it was because stepmothers were less-able parents or the
household was unstable. But now that we know it's not that, since
the biological children of those same women, living in the same
house, are more likely to go on to college.''
</P>
<P>
   Many stepmothers are quick to acknowledge that being a
stepparent is complicated, particularly when they take on older
children and that it is unrealistic to imagine that the new bonds
will be the same as those between a biological parent and child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very important, going into a stepfamily, to
understand that family integration is a process that takes four to
seven years,'' said Carol Albano-Lutz, a stepmother and
psychoanalyst in Woodcliff Lake, N.J., who treats mostly children
and adults in stepfamilies.
</P>
<P>
   And, Albano-Lutz said, in part because society generally holds
women responsible for family welfare, the most difficult process of
family integration involves the stepmother.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Sasse of Chesapeake City, Md., vice president of the
International Stepfamily Association, a nonprofit group, said:
``What I hear from new stepmoms all the time, especially with older
kids, is, `They just hate me. They don't want to give me a chance.
They think I'm taking their dad.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sasse is no longer in touch with her own stepmother, from whom,
she said, she ``learned everything a stepmother shouldn't do,'' a
lesson that became valuable three years ago when she married a man
with a 2-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have custody of all the kids,'' she said. ``I have a
wonderful relationship with my stepdaughter. But it does make a
difference that she has a biological mom out there. I'm a female
influence, but I'm not her mother. You have to respect that a
stepchild has that other parent.''
</P>
<P>
   Just what effect that other biological parent has, at least in
terms of health care, was one of the surprise findings of the
Princeton research.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected that children living with stepmoms would have less
health care if they were still in contact with the birth mother,''
Case said, ``because the stepmom might not know if the birth mother
was taking care of it, or might be getting some message from the
birth mother like, `No, you're not going to take my child to the
dentist.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But we found just the opposite,'' she said. ``Where
stepchildren had contact with their biological mother at least two
or three times a month, they had the same health care status as
children who lived with both biological parents. Having a birth
mother hovering was protective.
</P>
<P>
   Case said she initially expected that having a stepmother would
be better for children than having no mother at all, but her
findings showed that children reared solely by their biological
fathers did as well on health measures as children with
stepmothers.
</P>
<P>
   The education and food studies are based on data from the
University of Michigan's Panel Study of Income Dynamics, and the
health data from the Child Health Supplement to the National Health
Interview Survey, both nationally representative surveys of
thousands of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Case, the authors of the education and food
studies were I-Fen Lin of Bowling Green State University in
Kentucky and Sara McLanahan of Princeton. Case conducted the health
study with Christina Paxson of Princeton.

NEWS CORP. PROFITS FALL 14   PERCENT IN FOURTH QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The News Corp. said Wednesday that its after-tax profit for the
fourth quarter fell 14 percent. Profit before extraordinary items
was $184 million, or 18 cents per American depository receipt,
compared with $214 million, or 21 cents a share, in the comparable
period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue in the quarter, with ended June 30, rose 18 percent, to
$3.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported earnings of 6 cents a depository receipt
after all extraordinary items, compared with a loss of 2 cents a
year earlier. The losses from extraordinary items were largely
attributed to the rollout of digital services of the News Corp.'s
satellite television company British Sky Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   The results were slightly better than analysts' recent
expectations of 16 cents a share. But they were below the forecasts
made before the impact of dismal box office sales of ``Titan
A.E.,'' Fox studio's animated science fiction movie, was assessed.
</P>
<P>
   The company was most severely affected by an operating loss of
$53 million in the filmed entertainment division, compared with
operating income of $22 million in the similar period a year
earlier. Like several other studios, Fox raced into the animation
business, setting up its own studio. The unit took a $12 million
charge related to shutting the studio down.
</P>
<P>
   The largest improvement at the company was in the newspaper
division, where profits rose more than 50 percent, to $161 million
from $107 million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Fox television network has suffered from a
decline in ratings, cash flow at the News Corp.'s U.S. TV
operations rose 4 percent. Expenses rose because of series
cancellations, the broadcast of additional Major League Baseball
games and generally higher costs for new programming, but increased
sales of prime time advertisements helped raise the unit's
operating income.
</P>
<P>
   The News Corp.'s depository receipts fell 18.75 cents to close
at $51.25
</P>
<P>
   The company has just agreed to acquire Chris-Craft Industries
for $3.5 billion in stock and cash. The Chris-Craft Television
stations carry the UPN network, which is owned by Viacom. UPN's
contract with the stations is up next year, and Viacom could shut
the network down. But Rupert Murdoch, who controls the News Corp.,
said Wednesday that he was open to negotiating with Viacom about
the network's future on Chris-Craft stations. &QL;

VERIZON'S STRIKING UNIONS SET DEADLINE FOR SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a development that could drastically change the
direction of a 12-day walkout by more than 86,000 employees of
Verizon Communications, representatives for nearly two-thirds of
the striking workers said Wednesday that they would break off
negotiations if they did not reach an agreement with the company by
midnight Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which
represents about 14,000 striking employees, mostly in New Jersey,
Pennsylvania and New England states, and the northern unit of the
Communications Workers of America, which represents about 38,000
employees in New York and parts of New England, made the statement
late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The threat to withdraw from the negotiations clearly puts
pressure on Verizon, which is trying to handle a growing number of
requests for repair and new service from customers, to reach an
agreement that deals with the unions' concerns about issues that
include workplace stress and job security.
</P>
<P>
   And it also puts pressure on a bargaining unit from the
Communications Workers union that represents about 34,000 workers
in several mid-Atlantic states, which is thought to be holding up
the talks out of intransigence over several issues, people close to
the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, at least in public, the unions put the pressure on Verizon,
the telephone giant formed recently by Bell Atlantic's acquisition
of GTE Corp. In a message sent to the unions' local presidents in
New York Wednesday, the union said a proposal from Verizon
Wednesday dealing with the movement of jobs resulting from the Bell
Atlantic-GTE merger fell short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company still refuses to abandon its position that the
percentage of jobs moved should be calculated on a net basis, with
incoming jobs counted as offsetting any jobs moved out, no matter
what craft is affected,'' the message stated. ``In addition, the
company's position on the overall percentage of jobs that can be
moved remains unacceptably high.''
</P>
<P>
   The IBEW union, for its part, is thought to be upset that an
agreement reached last week making it easier to organize in
Verizon's wireless division might not go far enough, a person close
to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the union is not sure whether the agreement will
allow organizing in New Jersey with card check, a process in which
a majority of employees at a given work site can join a union by
signing cards instead of going through a formal election process, a
person close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon said it would try to address these issues, and others,
before the midnight deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want to get this done quickly, as it seems the two
groups are tired like us, and want this to end,'' said Eric Rabe,
Verizon's spokesman. ``Maybe they're trying to send the remaining
bargaining party a message.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Communication Workers unit that did not say
it would break off talks by midnight _ a region stretching from New
Jersey to Virginia and led by Vincent Maisano, a union vice
president _ has said it is more concerned with issues involving
mandatory overtime, because more of its members work as customer
service representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon is having a harder time negotiating with Maisano's unit
because of the mandatory overtime issue, a person close to the
talks said. Maisano could not be reached Wednesday for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the unions said they were working together to
resolve the strike.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations were expected to last through the night Wednesday
in an effort to clear up remaining issues.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Verizon is falling behind in meeting requests
for repairs and for installation of new telephone service. The
company said it had about 90,000 requests for repair Wednesday,
about a third more than normal.
</P>
<P>
   Cheri Grand-Anderman was among customers waiting for repairs
after her high-speed Internet access was knocked out 10 days ago
when vandals cut an access line near her Greenwich Village
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been exasperating: I feel like I've been slapped in the
face by Verizon,'' said Grand-Anderman, 31, who runs a public
relations company from her home. ``They haven't been the least bit
responsive in all my attempts to get my line repaired, even after I
told them I was losing thousands of dollars in business.''

LIEBERMAN STRESSES HUMBLE ROOTS AS HE ACCEPTS NOMINATION &HT;    (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)
 &HT;    By STEWART M. POWELL and DAN FREEDMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES Democratic vice presidential candidate Joseph
Lieberman, the first Jewish American nominated for a major party
ticket, described himself to the Democratic National Convention
Wednesday night as the humble beneficiary of the American dream who
is eager to extend opportunities to others left behind.
</P>
<P>
   The 58-year-old senator from Connecticut also offered ``some
straight talking'' about Republicans, delighting convention
delegates with the quip that Republican presidential nominee George
W. Bush's idea of school modernization is ``buying a new calendar
for every building.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman delivered his nationally-televised address as
Democratic delegates formally nominated the Gore-Lieberman ticket
to carry the party's banner against Bush, in his second term as
governor of Texas, and Dick Cheney, the former defense secretary
turned oil services company executive.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who credits the late President John F. Kennedy with
drawing him into public service, laid out the next step of the
cherished ``New Frontier'' enunciated here in Los Angeles by
Kennedy in 1960. ``I believe that the next frontier isn't just in
front of us but inside us to overcome the differences that are
still between us ... and to help every American claim the limitless
possibilities of our own lives,'' Lieberman declared.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, a graduate of Yale and Yale law school who was the
first in his family to attend college, recounted his humble
origins. His father had lived in an orphanage as a child, later
drove a bakery truck on the overnight shift and eventually owned a
liquor store.
</P>
<P>
   ``He taught us the importance of work and responsibility,''
Lieberman recalled, adding: ``Sometimes I try to see this world as
my dad saw it from his bakery truck.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberman's wife, Hadassah, the Czech-born daughter of Holocaust
survivors, introduced her husband to the convention as a principled
public servant ``shaped by the values that are his heart and
soul.'' Mrs. Lieberman called her husband ``just a regular Joe,''
adding: ``He's that and more.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier at an airport rally welcoming Gore and his wife Tipper
who arrived in the Los Angeles area Wednesday afternoon, Lieberman
mischievously told more than 1,000 supporters crowded into a
airport hanger to escape punishing sunshine: ``I've been waiting
for a week to say this line and I can't control myself anymore, _
in this election, will you help me win this one for the Tipper?''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, a veteran of nearly 12 years in the Senate who
patched up strains with African-Americans over his ambiguous
support for affirmative action, enthusiastically told Gore that
``this is the most excited and united Democratic Convention that we
have ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   As Gore stood by beaming, Lieberman told him: ``As I've walked
the floor of the convention and spoken to the delegates, this is a
convention that believes in you and loves you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore set the stage for his own acceptance speech to the
Democratic faithful on Thursday night by vowing to lay out the
``specific hard choices'' that face the nation to harness the
nation's booming prosperity to bolster Social Security, improve
public education, provide prescription drug coverage to senior
citizens and get ``guns out of the hands of children and
criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, hoping to strike a contrast with what aides describe as
the ``happy-talk'' generalities offered by Bush at the GOP
convention in Philadelphia two weeks ago, vowed to tell voters the
details of what he wants to do so they can ``make an informed
judgment choosing the first president of the 21st century. ``Let
others make the case for the old guard,'' Gore declared. ``We're
the new guard and we're going to bring positive change to the
United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Late polls showed Gore and Lieberman have their work cut out for
them. A Voter.com-Battleground tracking poll of likely voters
released Wednesday showed the Bush-Cheney ticket leading the
Gore-Lieberman ticket by 9 percentage points, 49 percent to 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's eldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, 27, a graduate of
Harvard and Columbia law school who often accompanies her father on
the campaign trail, delivered a personal key note address to
nominate her father as president.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff's address followed a well-received speech on Tuesday
night by Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, the 42-year-old daughter and
last direct relative of slain President John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the proud father, said that having his own daughter
address the nation had him worried, adding: ``I've got more
butterflies about that than my own speech.'' Gore's name also was
put in nomination by his Harvard roommate, the craggy-faced actor
Tommy Lee Jones.
</P>
<P>
   In her remarks to the convention, Schiff recalled her father's
help building a dinosaur diorama, icing down an igloo for an
overnight winter camp out and his unwillingness to ``never laugh at
our big plans.'' She said her father was a ``man of faith in the
most gutsy, practical sense,'' who would work for affordable health
care, equal pay for women, abortion rights and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., who would become
speaker of the House with a Democratic takeover of the House on
Nov. 7, made a pitch for a change of leadership in the House which
in recent years has been wracked by strident divisions between
Republican leaders and minority Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders ``don't communicate _ they dictate,''
declared Gephardt, an ally of organized labor who had been on
Gore's list of prospective running mates. ``Democracy deserves
better. Hear me: We will replace `my way or the highway' with `Our
way together,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates responded with a chant: ``Take back the House!
Take back the House!''
</P>
<P>
   California Gov. Gray Davis stirred the delegates by telling them
that Gore ``is not flashy...he's not some back-slapping good old
boy. He is a serious man of substance.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lieberman, his acceptance speech was a culmination of sorts
of a journey that began 58 years ago when he was born in Stamford,
Conn. His father, Henry, owned a liquor store, and his mother,
Marcia, raised him and his siblings as Orthodox Jews. Since
election to the Senate in 1988, Lieberman has fashioned himself
into a moderate-to-liberal lawmaker best known for occasional
stands against Democratic doctrine, including support for publicly
funded ``vouchers'' for private schools, opposition to affirmative
action and condemnation of the entertainment industry's
exploitation of sex and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was the first Democratic senator to publicly condemn
President Clinton's sexual dalliance with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky. William Bennett, the self-styled chief Republican
morals guru, described Lieberman as ``the closest thing in the
Senate to an Old Testament prophet.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who ceases work on the Jewish Sabbath on Saturday,
says he will continue honoring the Sabbath and on three Jewish
holidays in the weeks before the Nov. 7 election. ``I'm just going
to do what I've always done and work extra hard on the days that
I'm campaigning,'' Lieberman said before his address.
</P>
<P>
   Pollster Frank Luntz, who advised the independent presidential
bid of Texas billionaire Ross Perot in 1992, said Gore's selection
of Lieberman is paying off because the selection ``has already
caused people to take another look at Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Luntz said Republicans are at a loss about how to react to
Gore's choice of Lieberman because the ``way he communicates is so
gentle and so moderate in tone and the fact that he attaches
spiritualness to that communication goes right to the heart of many
conservatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Luntz, who also advised then-Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., on the
1994 campaign manifesto ``Contract with America'' that helped the
GOP to retake the House and Senate for the first time since 1954,
said Lieberman helps Gore win back politically conservative Jewish
Americans who have gradually started to vote Republican.
</P>
<P>
   There are roughly 5.5 million Jews in the United States, 10
percent of whom are Orthodox Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Luntz said the 40 percent share of the Jewish vote that a
Republican like Ronald Reagan won in 1984 might seep away with
Lieberman on the Democratic ticket, leaving Bush with roughly 20
percent of the Jewish vote. Lieberman gave Gore a boost in the
polls, just as Cheney did for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore gained 17 percentage points on Bush following his selection
of Lieberman, according to a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll. Gore cut
Bush's edge from 19 percentage points to 2 percentage points,
according to the surveys. Bush's selection of Cheney also gave the
GOP nominee a boost, enabling Bush to boost his margin by 10
percentage points, from 6 percentage points before he chose Cheney
to 16 percentage points after the selection.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Louisiana rocked the Democratic National
Convention on Tuesday night with an over-the-top Mardi Gras party
that practically registered on the Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Breaux hosted the faux Fat Tuesday on a back lot at
Paramount Studios in Hollywood, a venue that provides urban street
settings for such television shows as ``NYPD Blue.'' It made for an
authentic Mardi Gras atmosphere as more than 1,500 people enjoyed a
parade with full-scale floats, Cajun and swing music and Louisiana
cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great,'' exulted Ben Jeffers of Baton Rouge, La.,
chairman of the Louisiana state Democratic party. ``It is just like
Mardi Gras. The streets are packed.''
</P>
<P>
   Two dozen top health, energy, defense and tobacco corporations
and the centrist Democratic Leadership Council underwrote the
lavish event, which was estimated to cost more than $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   But Breaux was not apologetic about the financial support of
special interests with major issues pending before Congress, saying
his bash was about catching Mardi Gras beads, not political arm
twisting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows you have parties at the convention,'' said
Breaux, who met early arriving guests dressed in neon orange Mardi
Gras garb and brandishing the traditional umbrella. ``We deal with
these people in Washington on a regular basis. They are not going
to get anything out of the party they don't already have back in
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   But campaign finance watchdog groups have complained about the
level of extravagance at the parties thrown by lobbying groups at
both the Democratic convention and the earlier GOP convention in
Philadelphia. Unlike the GOP partiers, however, Breaux welcomed the
press to chronicle the festivities.
</P>
<P>
   The senator, always a colorful figure, was in rare form as he
took to the stage and joined the popular zydeco performer Rockin
Dopsie Jr., playing the washboard and dancing. He then changed into
a shimmering white Elvis-like costume to toss throws from a float
and get back on stage with the swing band Big Bad Voodoo Daddy.
</P>
<P>
   John Rother, a top lobbyist for AARP, was impressed by Breaux's
exuberance, which is atypical for the normally reserved members of
the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had seen everything,'' Rother said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who works closely with Breaux on
complex issues such as Medicare and Social Security, said Breaux
might have earned support for a future presidential bid through
sheer showmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``With John Breaux as president, I might show up at more of
those White House meetings,'' Leahy said. ``I've got enormous
admiration for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The guests gobbled shrimp, oysters, alligator and red beans and
rice, while guzzling hurricanes. Many declared the party, dubbed
``Mardi Gras Goes Hollywood,'' the best of the week.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeffers said there was more at work than simply providing a
fun evening under perfect weather conditions. He said the intent
was also to give convention organizers a taste of what it could be
like to hold the convention in New Orleans in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it goes a long way toward New Orleans being picked for
the next convention,'' he said. ``There is a reason to all this.''

TREASURY SECRETARY CLAIMS MUCH OF ECONOMIC BOOM IS DUE TO
CLINTON-GORE &HT;    By MARK HELM
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Claiming administration credit for much of the
nation's long-running boom, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers
said Wednesday that the good times would not have been possible
without President Clinton's policies, which, he said, Vice
President Al Gore helped shape.
</P>
<P>
   Summers said the administration's 1993 budget plan, which began
to lower the government's deficits, was a key catalyst for bringing
the economy out of recession and into expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question it was the president who set the course toward
balanced budgets, and that has helped our national economy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Summers said that by cutting deficits _ which stood at $290
billion in 1992 compared with a $124 billion surplus last year _
the administration freed up huge sums of money for businesses and
consumers to spend on goods and services and investments in new
technologies. That spending has led to greater productivity and the
booming economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Summers called Gore a ``partner'' with the president in crafting
the administration's economic policies. ``The president often
conferred with the vice president even before talking with his
economic advisers, and there's no doubt that (Gore) was a major
force in shaping our policies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The treasury secretary also credited the new
information-technology industry and the country's entrepreneurs. He
said they ``were, of course, absolutely necessary for success, but
they needed the tools to do the job and the confidence that the
government had its act together. If we had $2 trillion more in debt
_ like we would have without any changes in the early 1990s _ it
would have come out of money used for investment in the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate was 7.5 percent in 1992, compared with 4
percent in June. The inflation rate was 3 percent eight years ago,
compared with 1.5 percent last year. ``In the early 1990s, there
was an air of pervasive pessimism in this country that simply
doesn't exist today,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the role of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
in the economic surge, Summers praised his ``extraordinary record
of service'' but added that Greenspan held his job between1987 and
1993, when deficits were high, as well as between 1993 to the
present. Summers said some of the fed chairman's success in recent
years was due to Clinton's policies. ``It's a lot easier to manage
monetary policy when deficits are falling and surpluses are
rising,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Clinton has complained that he has not received
enough credit for the country's prosperity during his term in
office. And in his Monday speech at the Democratic National
Convention, he once more sought to refute Republican charges that
he did little more than have the luck to preside at a time when
business and technology were transforming America.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those who say the progress of the last eight years was an
accident, that we just coasted along, let's be clear: America's
success was not a matter of chance; it was a matter of choice,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the public has been reluctant to give him the credit he
thinks he deserves for the prosperity. In a Los Angeles Times poll
of 1,200 ``likely'' voters this spring, 15 percent gave Clinton
most of the credit, 24 percent credited the high-tech industry and
9 percent cited the Republican majority in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers present the Gore campaign with two major problems:
convincing people that the Clinton administration deserves more
credit for the economy and then convincing voters that Gore helped
create Clinton's policies.
</P>
<P>
   In another Los Angeles Times poll of ``likely'' voters conducted
earlier this month, 89 percent of those surveyed said the economy
was doing well, but 48 percent said Gore deserves no credit for the
good times. Thirty-four percent said he deserves some credit and 9
percent said he deserves a lot of credit.
</P>
<P>
   In that survey, 56 percent of likely voters said the country is
moving in the right direction while 36 percent said it is
off-track. But only 51 percent of the contented group favored Gore
and 37 percent favored Bush. Typically, the candidate of the party
holding the White House can expect to win as much as three quarters
of voters who say the country is on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   The Times polls each had a margin of error of plus or minus
three percentage points.

WILL EXPERIENCE LIFT U.S. SWIMMERS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ So many younger men. So many older women. The
2000 U.S. Olympic swimming team has the biggest age gap between the
leading female and male players this side of the London stage
production of ``The Graduate.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the experienced women can guide the inexperienced
men down the path to gratification in Sydney will be a central
theme of the Summer Olympics for the 47-person U.S. contingent.
</P>
<P>
   Public perception holds that the team assembled over the past
eight days at the IUPUI Natatorium is the H.M.S. Titanic, chugging
toward the giant iceberg in Australia that is Ian Thorpe and Co.
Yes, the Americans didn't set a single world record here while the
Australians, led by freestyle phenom Thorpe, lowered five global
marks at their Olympic selection meet in May.
</P>
<P>
   But the timing must be considered along with the times.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian Trials were held early enough in the year to
allow the host country's swimmers to peak in May and then resume
heavy training with an eye toward peaking again next month. Most of
the very best U.S. swimmers, on the other hand, have been logging
miles upon miles without interruption, building toward performances
that they hope will crest and form The Perfect Swim in the vicinity
of Sydney Harbour in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more Olympians I talk to, the more it seems a lot of
swimmers really have been projecting forward to the next meet,''
said Mark Schubert, the USC men's and women's and USA head men's
Olympic coach. ``I really believe we're going to be a lot faster in
Sydney.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite cutting back relatively little on their training, Studio
City's Lenny Krayzelburg turned in the fastest time in the world
this year in the 100 backstroke, Megan Quann clocked the leading
time in the world in the 100 breaststroke, and Brooke Bennett and
Tom Dolan posted the No. 1 times globally in the 800-meter
freestyle and 400 individual medley, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Those swims bode well for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   And if there were eight events - five on the women's side - in
which the fastest time in the championship race didn't crack the
top-3 of the world rankings, well, it's a little early yet to be
conjuring the ghosts of 1988.
</P>
<P>
   That was the last U.S. team that was selected this close to the
Summer Games, and it performed dismally in Seoul. Only Janet Evans
and Matt Biondi captured individual golds. On Wednesday, U.S.
Olympic coaches Richard Quick and Schubert received this tidbit,
and we don't blame them for reflexively rejecting it.
</P>
<P>
   To lump the 2000 squad with the underachievers of 1988 is as
ill- advised as assuming a George W. Bush presidency would mirror
his father's. It was a different stage, a different time, with
different personalities in the lead roles.
</P>
<P>
   The 1988 team had holdovers from the 1984 squad - this was
particularly with the men - who performed as though they were happy
just to have made another Olympic team. Many women were too green
to go for the gold.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the experience of this year's female Olympians
figures prominently. It will be up to the likes of Dara Torres,
Jenny Thompson, Amy Van Dyken and B.J. Bedford (average age of the
foursome: 28 years) to lead by words and deeds in a way the veteran
men in 1988 did not.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, 33, who won the 50-meter freestyle during the final
session of the U.S. Trials, personifies a women's squad nearly old
enough to remember nylon-skirted racing suits. Thirteen of the 24
women have completed their collegiate eligibility, and Torres is
such a veteran of the Olympics she ought to qualify for some kind
of pension; Sydney will be her fourth Summer Games appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Davis, 27, is the oldest swimmer among the U.S. men. His
experience as a parent - he and his wife are expecting their third
child early next month - will come in handy as eight of the 23
spots on the men's side are filled by teen-agers. That is a change
from 1996 when Tom Malchow, then 19, was the most boyish of the
men.
</P>
<P>
   Malchow made it back, but he has a 15-year-old, Michael Phelps,
on his tail. Phelps conceivably could chase Malchow all the way to
the medal stand in Sydney. Ditto 17-year-old Aaron Peirsol, who's
in hot pursuit of Krayzelburg, the world record holder in the 100
and 200-meter backstrokes. And not to be overlooked is
Krayzelburg's 19-year-old Trojan Swim Club teammate Eric Vendt, who
is nipping at Dolan's heels in the 400 individual medley.
</P>
<P>
   All the young blood has acted as a surge of adrenaline for
Malchow, Krayzelburg and Dolan, the only Americans who will go into
the Sydney Games with the added prestige (and pressure) of being
world record holders.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the men's side, we certainly have some phenomenal high
school athletes who busted onto the team,'' Schubert said. ``It's
very encouraging to see high school athletes breaking through and
not just making the team but establishing themselves as medal
contenders.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the intangibles. Gracing the U.S. team is Chad
Carvin, who overcame a diseased heart to make his longtime Olympic
dream a reality, and Gary Hall Jr., who is battling not only his
training mate, Anthony Irvin of Valencia, but diabetes, too.
</P>
<P>
   There's Thompson, who rebounded from a disastrous Trials
performance four years ago to emerge as one of this year's stars;
and Torres, who took seven years off and then dove headfirst into
training, working out up to eight hours a day to earn her way to
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Representing the U.S. is backstroker Courtney Shealy, who
lettered three years in volleyball at Georgia, and butterflyer
Tommy Hannan, who played quarterback for his high school varsity
team.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Krayzelburg, arguably the biggest name at the meet,
who cheered himself hoarse rooting for his Trojan Swim Club
teammates and friends on the U.S. national team to join him in
Sydney. We can't blame him for wanting them along: A team this
gutty, gifted, gracious and goal-oriented could go to Sydney and
have quite a ball, crashing the world's party.

FRANKLIN CHARTS NEW GOSPEL WATERS WITH 1NC
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By DAVE FERMAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There will be some controversy surrounding ``Kirk Franklin
Presents 1NC,'' the debut CD by the nine-person, multiracial group
that Franklin has groomed and produced.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the CD includes traditional, old-school gospel and the sort
of hip-hop-laden modern praise music that Franklin has excelled at
for nearly a decade, while rising from obscurity in Fort Worth to
becoming arguably the most famous gospel artist in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But ``1NC'' (short for One Nation Crew) also finds Franklin (who
wrote or arranged all but one of the 18 tracks) taking this group
to different places _ different from where his music has gone
before, and different from where most of his urban gospel
contemporaries have gone, too.
</P>
<P>
   The first single, ``Nobody,'' merges slick, bubbly hip-hop
gospel with flamenco guitar. ``Unconditional'' also has more than a
bit of Latin flavoring. And then there's ``Could've Been Me,'' a
showcase for the group's sole white male vocalist, Brandon Kizer,
which merges rock guitar and a Christian rock-band feel with
compelling gospel harmonies. And, finally, there is the awesome
``Be Like Him,'' a merging of traditional American gospel with
African harmonizing that was recorded with the African group
Chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Some people will not like this.
</P>
<P>
   I am not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   To these ears, ``1NC'' does many things right: Franklin's
strengths as a songwriter and producer are in full force, the group
is a sure-handed, inspiring unit with several compelling lead
vocalists (my favorites being Myron Butler and Ashley Guilbert) and
the forays into diverse territories are invariably successful.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin's vision of racial inclusiveness in modern urban gospel
is one whose time has come and, in fact, has been evident on the
contemporary Christian charts for years. The surprising moves are
so well-integrated into the whole that they never seem jarring, and
the CD has a smart flow of tempos, sounds and lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the CD shows that Franklin is still willing to tackle
topics that most gospel artists shy away from; ``Donna'' is a look
at teen pregnancy, ``When You Fall'' deals with the idea of
inevitably making serious mistakes and finding redemption, and
``Lost Hearts'' takes modern society to task for permissive
attitudes and lack of feeling for others.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, then, ``1NC'' is one of the year's finest gospel
CDs. Franklin is still head and shoulders above most of his
contemporaries in writing, producing and vision, and 1NC is a
compelling, extremely talented new group. I predict great things. &QL;

LONG LIVE THE KINGS

 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three years ago when a publicist offered me passes to see a live
comedy tour called ``The Kings of Comedy,'' I didn't hesitate
before declining.
</P>
<P>
   A night watching Steve Harvey and three other little-known
comedians hardly seemed worth putting more miles on the old Honda.
However, had I known then what I know after having seen the film
version of that successful tour, I would have rented a car. The
Kings rule.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed in two nights at the Charlotte Coliseum in Charlotte,
N.C., and directed by Spike Lee, ``The Original Kings of Comedy''
is one of those side-splitting laugh fests. Harvey and Cedric the
Entertainer ``(The Steve Harvey Show),'' D.L. Hughley ``(The
Hughleys)'' and Bernie Mac ``(Life, Get on the Bus)'' are
inventive, raunchy, brilliant, savvy, intoxicating and politically
incorrect comics whose humor not only cracks you up, but also
challenges the way you think.
</P>
<P>
   Their natural tendency toward profanity aside, the comedians'
most valuable asset is their ability to come at you with common
sense, every-man-woman-and-child-over-13 comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Latham, who co-produced the film with David Gale, is the
guiding force behind the Kings of Comedy tour that launched in
summer 1997. Although it seemed like a fairly risky idea _ none of
the comics had much crossover appeal or name recognition _ The
Kings routinely sold out arenas nationwide and grossed $37 million
over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kings'' might not exactly make household names of its four
headliners, but it's likely to appeal to mass audiences in much the
same way Richard Pryor's classic ``Live on the Sunset Strip'' and
Eddie Murphy's ``Raw'' did during the '80s. Individually, these
Kings do not possess Pryor's comedic genius or Murphy's broad
appeal, but collectively, they come close.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, in his first big-screen documentary, does a good job of
interweaving live action with backstage hijinks. We see Harvey
conspiring with his handlers to embarrass an audience member in a
front-row hot seat; there's Mac praying with his wife before he
goes on stage; Cedric agonizing over which hat to wear with which
outfit; and Hughley cracking up the others during a poker game.

THOUGH ELDERLY AND FRAIL, PAULINE GORE REVELS IN HER SON'S BIG
MOMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN SACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On the day that her beloved Democrats were to
nominate her beloved son for president, Pauline LaFon Gore sat in
an elegant ballroom at the Regal Biltmore Hotel and greeted a long
line of admirers who had come to pay tribute to the 87-year-old
matriarch of the Gore family.
</P>
<P>
   She fussed over every guest, whether old friend or stranger,
lingering so long in some cases that Karenna Gore Schiff, her
granddaughter, felt obliged to move the crowd along. When Marcia
Lieberman paid an unexpected visit, Mrs. Gore rose from her chair
and offered a warm hug to the 85-year-old mother of her son's
running mate. She made no speech, but blew kisses to her
granddaughter after Schiff toasted her as ``truly an amazing
woman'' who had inspired thousands with ``her charm and grace, her
grit and determination and her idealism.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a remarkable moment in the remarkable life of Pauline
Gore, a woman who rose from humble beginnings to become one of the
first women to graduate from Vanderbilt University's law school,
who participated as a full partner in the 32-year congressional
career of her late husband, Sen. Albert Gore Sr., who endured his
painful defeat in 1970 and the death of their daughter, Nancy, in
1984, and who has been a bulwark in the political life of her son,
Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a bittersweet moment for Mrs. Gore, who will watch
her son's acceptance speech on Thursday night surrounded by family
but missing her husband, who died in 1998 after nearly 91 years of
life and 61 years of marriage. They met while she served him coffee
at the Andrew Jackson Hotel in Nashville, where both were law
students. Together they stoked their son's ambition, nurturing him
for public service since his earliest days and providing him with a
seamless political resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really were a lovely couple to behold,'' said Bill
McSweeney, a longtime family friend who recalls the Gores holding
hands while watching ``The Lawrence Welk Show'' on Saturday nights.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, Mrs. Gore has endured a heart attack, brain surgery
to remove a blood clot, and two strokes, one of which impaired her
vision. Her husband trained her to walk again after the strokes,
and she now strolls around the family farm in Carthage, Tenn.,
using one of his old wooden canes. The day after her surgery, she
asked her nurses to hook up cable television in her hospital room
so she could watch C-Span.
</P>
<P>
   She has good days, when she is just as lucid as ever, and when
her extraordinary memory is as sharp as the picture on a new
television set. On other days, family members and friends say, she
can appear tired and slightly confused. The vice president, who is
highly protective of his mother, no longer allows her to grant
formal interviews, and she has not done one for three years.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no sign Wednesday that Mrs. Gore, known to all as
Miz Pauline, was having a bad day. And her family and friends say
she has been completely attuned to her son's campaign in recent
weeks and thrilled to be attending the Democratic National
Convention. ``She is having a ball,'' said Schiff. ``This is her
cup of tea. She is completely in heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   While Mrs. Gore is no longer strong enough to wage the kind of
cross-country campaign she undertook during her son's 1988
presidential race, she has not been content to sit idly at the
farm. She speaks almost daily to her son _ three times on the day
of the New Hampshire primary _ and watches the Sunday political
talk shows, making mental note of who says anything nasty about her
boy.
</P>
<P>
   She attends Democratic events around Tennessee, took a prime
seat at last week's unveiling of the Gore-Lieberman ticket in
Nashville, and has made numerous unscheduled visits to the campaign
headquarters there. ``She says, `I just had to come check on
you,''' said Donna Brazile, Gore's campaign manager. ``She wants to
talk to the strategists and the lawyers. She wants to know who
everybody is, where they're from. And she reassures us that Al Gore
is going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Many who know Mrs. Gore well say that politics has been her
tonic. ``She can really be down and then she'll get involved in the
political process and she just seems to draw enormous strength from
it,'' said Jerry H. Futrell, a Carthage pharmacist and longtime
friend.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore has long been considered the most astute political
mind in the family, a pragmatic strategist who continues to embrace
the old-fashioned notion that politics can be personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``She recognizes in this wonderful, sort of uniquely feminine
way how the human interaction in relationships are vital to social
change,'' said Schiff. ``She has been a hostess in many ways
throughout my family's political life but a hostess with real power
and insight.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who know the family well say that Al Gore drew more of his
temperament from his mother than from the father he followed into
the House and the Senate. Both mother and son, they say, are
reserved.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Gore seems to have drawn strength and confidence from
his mother's enduring presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has given him the courage, the intellect, the background
and the confidence that comes from a strong family,'' said Peter
Knight, a former aide. ``He always knew they'd be behind him and
you have to have that confidence when you're running for president
of the United States.''

 &HT;    THE ILLUSION OF POLITICAL REALITY
 &HT;    This article replaces Andrew Glass's regular Sunday column. It
is for immediate release.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Yeah,'' said Chris Lehane, ``the whole thing is
an illusion. But it really seems authentic.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehane wasn't talking about politics _ a familiar subject to the
press secretary to Vice President Al Gore, who wants to move up.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had been in the movie capital for less than hour. Flanked
by 100-plus khaki-clad motorcycle policemen, he had been driven in
a black armored Cadillac with District of Columbia plates to the
``Main Street'' lot at Warner Brothers Studios. That was Lehane's
``illusion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore family took a break from the midday heat in what's
known in the trade as a holding area _ ``Stars Hollow High
School.''
</P>
<P>
   Perched on the roof of the two-story ``school,'' Secret Service
agents, dressed in dark-blue work uniforms, peered out at who knows
what through oversized binoculars. Gore's limo was positioned
nearby the cordoned-off ``town square,'' where a party was under
way.
</P>
<P>
   The guests were the Tennessee and Connecticut delegations to the
Democratic National Convention. Gore's guests in the holding area
were Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut and his family.
</P>
<P>
   Set up in front of the ``school,'' Mickey Hart's rock band
played at a level that discouraged conversation. But the delegates
seemed content enough.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, however, they stirred and left their picnic tables to
rush to one side of the ``square.'' Secret Service agents began
whispering into their wrist radios.
</P>
<P>
   What's up, I asked one of them?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Martin Sheen,'' the agent said. ``He's right over
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheen, who plays a president in the CBS television show ``West
Wing,'' was signing autographs for the delegates. Other members of
the ``West Wing'' cast, which is filmed at the Warner studios, were
also having their pictures taken.
</P>
<P>
   Then Mickey Hart called it quits, and the candidates and their
families stepped out onto the bandstand. The cheers were somewhat
dimmed by the heat and the outdoor venue. But the television people
already had gotten all they needed of that from a hangar event at
Burbank Airport that took place when Air Force Two landed.
</P>
<P>
   Before introducing Gore, Lieberman said, ``we're having one hell
of a time.'' The first Jewish vice presidential nominee also noted
that he had spotted a sign during the motorcade that read: ``Viva
Chutzpah.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Lieberman, who had been talking that morning about ``our
Republican friends,'' delivered his punch line: ``The closest
George Bush will get to the West Wing is a remote control.'' The
delegates liked that.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was time to go. After shaking hands all around and
hugging many of the women delegates, Gore and Lieberman climbed
into Gore's limo and sped away on a 12-lane freeway that had been
cleared in both directions. They went to Gore's hotel, the same one
that President Clinton had vacated a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Now left on their own, the other members of Lieberman's family,
accompanied by a far more modest police escort, wound the way back
to their hotel. Since the freeways from Warner Brothers to downtown
Los Angeles were heavily jammed at the start of the evening rush
hour, their return trip from ``Main Street'' took a very long time.

<P>
   IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS NATIONAL FOREST, N.H. _ Over slick
boulders and thick roots, across narrow bridges and through mud
that coated their limbs, three hikers in wheelchairs and two on
crutches won a 12-hour struggle up the Gale Head trail here Tuesday
to reach a mountain hut that naysayers had said they would never
use.
</P>
<P>
   The moral being, said one hiker: Do not tell us where we will
not, and can not, go.
</P>
<P>
   Their destination, the Gale Head hut at an elevation of 3,800
feet, has just been rebuilt by the Appalachian Mountain Club.
During its construction, some club members and New Hampshire
newspapers ridiculed the idea of making the rustic 38-bed lodge
accessible to the handicapped, complete with a ramp and ``grab
bars'' in bigger toilet stalls. It was an absurd waste of money,
they said, because no one in a wheelchair was ever going to get
over the super-rugged 4.6-mile trail.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. Under their own power, but also helped mightily by
family, friends and volunteers who pulled, pushed and tipped them
over boulder after boulder, the three hikers in wheelchairs reached
the wood-shingled hut at sunset _ and, with the happy exhaustion of
any hiker and then some, rolled up the welcoming ramp to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The hikers' achievement, and the controversy that spurred it,
highlighted a broader phenomenon in the country's wilderness areas:
a push to make everything from outhouses to campgrounds more
friendly to disabled people _ and the debate it sometimes raises
over the wisdom of trying to make the naturally hard-to-get-to
outdoors more accessible.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Forest Service officials say they have no plans to pave
trails or significantly change wilderness areas to conform to
federal disability rules. But, said Janet A. Zeller, who oversees
the agency's push for accessibility, ``When you get to a
person-built facility, you're beyond what nature has put there for
you, and you're into what people have built, and therefore it needs
to meet a standard so that when you get to a structure, you know
what to expect. It's that `Whew!' at the end of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   The national forests in the service's Eastern Region, which
ranges from Maine to Minnesota and Missouri to West Virginia, spent
$2 million in the last year and $18 million in the last eight on
improving accessibility, Zeller said, and has been working on
general guidelines for outdoor access.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Gale Head hut, Appalachian Mountain Club
officials estimate they paid an extra $30,000 to $50,000 for a
building that was already costing about $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   But New Hampshire is a flinty-spirited state, and the
modifications to the hut were pricey because they were last-minute:
the mountain club learned only belatedly from the Forest Service
that the hut, even though it is among the club's remotest, must
comply with the accessibility rules for new buildings in the
Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the club's leadership did not mind. Walter Graff,
the group's deputy director, said that the hut ended up with a
better overall design, including widened hallways, a porch and the
elimination of steps up to the bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The AMC is about bringing people to the outdoors,'' Graff
said. ``The fact they're in wheelchairs or otherwise disabled
shouldn't prevent that.''
</P>
<P>
   But others did mind, or at least raised challenges. A local TV
reporter asked why, if people in wheelchairs could drag themselves
up the trail, they could not drag themselves up steps to the hut.
One Appalachian Mountain Club member wrote to the group's magazine,
``So what does a tired hiker see when he gets to the hut? A
wheelchair ramp. Any reasonable person is going to be shocked, then
bemused. What a waste of money.'' Another said that the federal
disability rules could be read to mean that all trails should be
paved, and demanded, ``When will AMC start to fight such insane
regulations instead of meekly acquiescing?''
</P>
<P>
   At Northeast Passage, a program at the University of New
Hampshire that works with people with disabilities, news that the
hut would be accessible at first prompted casual plans to try to
go, said Jill Gravink, the program's director.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Then, when the criticism started coming out, ``All of a sudden
it was, `Hey, we have to make this trip,''' she said. ``Nicole
Haley rolled into my office with a newspaper article and said, `I'm
doing this, are you guys coming?''' They took it as a real slap in
the face, like, `Who are you to tell me I can't do this? How do you
know how much of my own sweat I'm willing to put into getting up
there?'''
</P>
<P>
   (As for the TV reporter, Gravink said she responded, ``Why
bother putting steps on the hut at all? Why not drag yourself in
through a window?'')
</P>
<P>
   And so, after almost a year of planning, with organization by
Northeast Passage and help from We Media, an advocacy media group
for people with disabilities, along with other sponsors, the hikers
set off at about 7:30 a.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The three who used wheelchairs were trying out special Terra
Trek-brand models engineered for the most rugged terrain; they and
their helpers had devised a variety of tested but still
experimental tricks, from long poles that could let helpers lift
the wheelchairs almost like rickshaw bearers, to tethers that let
helpers pull the chairs like oxen, to simple planks that could be
laid over brook crossings or rough ground.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Krill, a ski instructor and hotel clerk whose 60-year-old
father, Phil, helped push and pull his wheelchair, said that in
making the trip, he wanted to show people in wheelchairs that they
could get out and enjoy the woods, though not necessarily on such
difficult trails.
</P>
<P>
   The trail started out relatively gentle, though every root,
every rock demanded effort that able-bodied hikers would never
think about. Early on, Craig Gray, a management consultant and
Paralympic cross-country skier, took a tumble in his wheelchair
down a hill, but the teams of helpers quickly learned how to keep
their wheelchair athletes upright.
</P>
<P>
   By about 10 a.m., the going got slower, and at about 10:30 came
the one sour note of the day: a hiker who cursed at the group for
blocking the trail and said he thought the whole thing was
ridiculous, adding an expletive for emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   After lunch by a rushing river came the hardest part: the
infamous boulder-staircase known as Jacob's Ladder, with rounded
rock steps big enough to get any hiker huffing. The group tried a
modified Tyrolean traverse, lifting the wheelchairs off the ground
with ropes and letting their occupants pull themselves upward with
a pulley system.
</P>
<P>
   It worked, but not well, and the hikers in wheelchairs went back
to other techniques, including the move that Gray called the
``butt-up,'' in which he simply sat with his back facing the
boulder staircase and lifted himself from step to step using upper
body strength.
</P>
<P>
   Each wheelchair-hiker developed a different style. At one point,
the group around Nicole Haley, who has used a wheelchair since she
fell off a ladder two years ago, resorted to singing ``You've Lost
That Loving Feeling,'' to keep its strength up, and sent renditions
over walkie-talkies to other groups. Gray's team had a slightly
macho style, using exhortations like ``Let's eat that rock!''
</P>
<P>
   All reached the hut at sundown, too tired for ringing
pronouncements, having completed in 12 hours what takes an average
able-bodied hiker 3 1/2. Though Souley Marzouk, who got polio as a
child in Mali and made the trek on crutches, did say: ``This shows
how determined we are, and how far determination can take you. It
wasn't easy but I guess we figured it wasn't going to be, and
that's why we did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon everyone went inside to the cozy wooden warmth for potato
soup and cheese steak _ and champagne _ at the hut's long tables.
They were to spend Wednesday relaxing at the hut, and Thursday
facing a whole new challenge: the way down.
</P>
<P>
   Would the hut's ramp ever really be used again? Would they ever,
really, want to do this again, after all the almost-tipping and
rib-bruising and grueling labor? Sure, said Krill, 29. ``Next time
I can get enough people to do it with me.''

 &HT;    DEMOCRATS SAY THEY'RE THE REAL PARTY OF DIVERSITY
 &HT;    By WILLIAM HERSHEY and MIKE WAGNER
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Democrats have had a good time yukking it up this
week about what they call the Republican ``delusion of inclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want to see real diversity, these Democrats say, come to
Los Angeles and forget about the ``masquerade'' party the
Republicans held in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our convention, our party, our members truly is the face of
America,'' said state Sen. Rhine McLin, Ohio Senate minority
leader. ``The other side had to work awfully hard to get a few
faces of color in their convention crowd. It was a masquerade and
it would be a sad day for all minorities if (George W.) Bush got in
the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of sheer numbers, it's hard for even Ohio Republicans
to refute McLin.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Ohio delegates to the Republican National Convention who
responded to a Dayton Daily News survey, 82 percent were white, 12
percent were black and 6 percent were other minorities, including
Asians and Hispanics. Over all, 83 percent of the delegates to the
Republican convention were white.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio delegation in Philadelphia was split even about evenly
between men and women.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Los Angeles, 24 percent of the Ohio delegates are black,
4 percent are Hispanic and 1 percent are Asian. The delegation
includes 85 men and 84 women.
</P>
<P>
   Three percent of the Ohio delegation is made up of gays and
lesbians, a category not advertised by Ohio Republicans at their
convention.
</P>
<P>
   In diversity terms, the Ohio delegation compares favorably to
the Democratic National Convention as a whole. Over all, 20 percent
of the delegates are black, 10 percent are Hispanic, 3 percent are
Asian-Pacific and 4 percent are gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio Democrats exceeded the diversity goals they set for
themselves in several categories, said David Leland, state
Democratic chairman.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the goal was to include 36 black delegates, and the
party ended up with 41. The number of Hispanic delegates _ six _
was double the goal of three, said Leland.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Shinn, an Ohio Democratic delegate, said the party's
diversity is a strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our party doesn't fear differences. We don't fear diversity.
We embrace it,'' said Shinn, and attorney and president of the
Stonewall Democrats of Central Ohio, which includes gay and lesbian
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Romero, 41, an Hispanic delegate from Lorain, Ohio, said
that the perception that Bush and the Republicans have connected
with minority voters is a ``fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics in Texas are proud that Bush's nephew in Florida,
George P. Bush, has a Mexican mother, said Romero.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they also remember George W. Bush's father referring to
George P. As 'the little brown one,' `` Romero said.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell, the first black to
hold statewide administrative office in Ohio, said his party is
working hard to ``rebuild a competitive two-party system in the
African-American community.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a work in progress,'' said Blackwell, who was here this
week as a surrogate for George W. Bush, rebutting Democratic
claims.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plans for cutting taxes and reforming Social Security by
allowing younger workers to invest a small portion of their Social
Security savings in the stock market will help African-Americans,
just as they will help all Americans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio state Rep. Dixie Allen doesn't buy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I disagree with Ken Blackwell,'' said Allen, a delegate here.
``The party he has chosen is not the party of diversity. It does
almost nothing to assist minority people and their communities. I
don't have to go around Dayton recruiting African-Americans and
other minorities to join our party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans can talk all they want about inclusion, but
people have long known the Democratic party is their only hope for
diversity.''

 &HT;    Texas defensive back Jammer healthy, ready to hit again
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - Pity the wide receiver who lines up across from
Quentin Jammer the first day the University of Texas football team
dons pads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get to hit on Tuesday,'' said an antsy Jammer. ``Let's just
say whoever lines up against me will have a tough time getting off
the line of scrimmage.''
</P>
<P>
   Jammer is UT's most versatile defensive back. He's also the one
who craves the rush of a kamikaze hit more than any of his
defensive teammates.
</P>
<P>
   But he hasn't popped a receiver in almost a year.
</P>
<P>
   Jammer was set to have an all-star year last season at free
safety, but his season ended in August against North Carolina
State. Jammer barely made it into the fourth quarter of that first
game.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the game he had dislocated his left shoulder while
trying to make an arm tackle. The shoulder, which had been
troubling him for more than a year, was popped back in place and
Jammer returned only to reinjure the shoulder..
</P>
<P>
   A week later, doctors used four screws to tighten the shoulder
ligaments. Jammer spent the season watching Greg Brown not only
take over his position, but excel.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday morning, when the Longhorns gather for their first
full-squad workout, Jammer will be at a different position. In the
off-season, the UT defensive staff decided that with Brown more
than capable of handling free safety, they could move Jammer to
cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a great athlete, switching to corner hasn't been a
problem for him,'' Brown said. ``As far as the NFL is concerned,
corner is probably Quentin's best position. Whether he's a better
corner or safety, hey, he can play both.''
</P>
<P>
   Jammer's transition to corner has been smooth. He played the
position in high school at Angleton and started four games there as
a freshman in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's easier on my shoulder to move to corner,'' said
Jammer, who said his surgically repaired shoulder now tests
stronger than his right one. ``It's not something at first that I
really wanted to do. But I'm happy to make the move. I'm happy to
play corner. As an athlete, I feel I can play either position
really well.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-0, 200-pound junior gives the Longhorns that rare physical
cornerback who is big enough to match up against today's taller
receivers and physical enough to also play the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quentin has got the physical size we're looking for,'' said
Everett Withers, UT secondary coach. ``He has a unique body type
for a corner because he's like 6-0, 6-1. He's a big guy, he runs
well, and he has good hips. And those long arms of his make him a
real asset at corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got unique skills. If he works hard during two-a-days,
he's got a chance to be something really special.''
</P>
<P>
   Jammer has yet to earn a starting spot _ he still is behind
Ahmad Brooks and Ervis Hill _ but his move to first team appears to
be imminent. Brooks and Hill, both juniors, have 26 starts between
them, but they are only 5-foot-8. Their lack of height became a
problem last season, when opposing offensive coordinators found
ways to isolate taller receivers against them.
</P>
<P>
   It's also likely that NFL scouts will be taking a peek at Jammer
while they're in town this fall to check out potential
first-rounders, seniors Casey Hampton, Shaun Rogers and Leonard
Davis. Jammer said he is not considering giving up his final year
of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I haven't really thought about it,'' he said. ``I
might need that fifth year.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he has been thinking about that first day in pads. He
participated in spring workouts, but he wasn't given the go ahead
to pop his teammates until now.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has been out of action for a year, his hitting
reputation still is well-known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jammer is good at jamming receivers at the line of
scrimmage,'' Withers said. ``He's got a good name for what he has
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes:
</P>
<P>
   Freshman running back Tyrone Richardson will not play this
season because of academic reasons. He hopes to return in the
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be difficult not being able to play this fall,
but I have some academic issues I have to take care of to return to
the team,'' Richardson said in a statement issued by UT. ``I am
going to take care of that this fall and hope to be back with the
team in January.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's brief career with the Longhorns has been
sidetracked twice because of academics. He signed with UT in
February 1999, but was not able to report with his class last
August because he did not make the minimum test score on his
college entrance exams. Richardson sat out last fall, made his
score, then enrolled at UT at midterm.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Major Applewhite will be able to practice Friday,
although coach Mack Brown said he was unsure what Applewhite's
limitations might be. Applewhite underwent reconstructive knee
surgery to repair an anterior cruciate ligament. He suffered the
injury in the second half of the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite said his knee ``feels great.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't swelled at all, not one time,'' Applewhite said. ``I
ice it so I won't get tendinitis. Sometimes I wonder why I ice it
because I haven't had any pain at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was released June 7 (by the doctors). If I would have had to
have played a game that day, I could have.''

SURVIVORS TELL OF SUBMARINE HORRORS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.H., Calif.)  By CHRISTOPHER DREW with DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though no one knows just what agonies have befallen the men on
Russia's Kursk submarine, other sailors who have been trapped
beneath the sea describe how quickly the air can turn toxic and
serious physical and emotional deterioration can set in.
</P>
<P>
   The classic image of the dangers of submarine warfare has come
from movies like ``Das Boot,'' where men huddle quietly together to
try to ride out depth-charge attacks and keep their hopes alive.
</P>
<P>
   But as Russian officials spoke with fading hope Wednesday of
saving the men on the Kursk, both Russians and Americans who have
been aboard other stricken submarines, including some cornered in
Cold War confrontations, said headaches were common within a day as
the air grew foul. And many men began gasping for breath and taking
to their bunks with throbbing head pain by the second or third day
as rising levels of deadly carbon dioxide began to consume them.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the second morning, some of us were kind of numb,'' said
Clifford A. Smith, who was on a diesel-powered submarine that was
forced by Soviet forces to go without fresh air for three days on
an early spy mission back in the 1950s. He said the conditions were
probably similar to what has been happening on the hobbled Kursk,
which is no longer able to produce its own fresh air.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the lights were dimmed, and special chemicals were
scattered to absorb some of the carbon dioxide, Smith said, the
crew's condition became so desperate that the sub's captain was
forced to surface _ and allow the Soviets to herd his submarine
away from their coast.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1980, former submariners say, one U.S. sailor had to be
sedated when a spy sub that he was on became temporarily stuck in
the sand in a Soviet seabed.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known how many of the Kursk's 118 crew members
survived the initial catastrophe that led to its sinking last
Saturday, and Russian navy leaders said Wednesday that they did not
know how many were still alive, if any.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have said that an explosion, possibly
involving one of the Kursk's torpedoes, may have ripped a hole in
the front of the submarine, allowing seawater to flood several
compartments in the front of the sub and sent it spiraling down to
the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Many international experts think any air left in the sub may
have turned poisonous by now, and that nearly all those who
survived the explosion and flooding has probably been overcome by
the buildup of gasses like carbon dioxide, which everyone exhales.
</P>
<P>
   But one of those experts, Rear Adm. Georgi G. Kostov, an
instructor at Russia's naval academy, said Wednesday that it is
possible that some crew members could still be huddled to the rear
of the vessel. And even in describing the best-case scenario, he
painted a picture of an increasingly dank and choking environment
that would soon break even the bravest and most resilient sailor.
</P>
<P>
   The admiral said that if any crew members were still alive, they
would be very cold, as the near-freezing waters of the Barents Sea
undoubtedly has turned the submarine's metal hull into a giant
refrigerator. He also said the men would be getting ``sleepy, going
into a dormant state.''
</P>
<P>
   Kostov said they would still have food and possibly flashlights.
They also might have been able to burn some special candles that
give off oxygen. But, he said, ``the oxygen is running out with
every hour.''
</P>
<P>
   A look at several other disasters and close calls involving
submarines shows how little room there is for error in safeguarding
men caught in ocean depths that many experts describe as every bit
as treacherous _ and unforgiving _ as outer space.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the Russians' efforts to retrieve any survivors on
the Kursk with a giant diving bell most closely resembles what
happened after a primitive U.S. submarine, the USS Squalus, sunk in
1939.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Bryson, 82, who now lives in New London, Conn., recalled in
an interview Wednesday that he was trapped on the Squalus for some
36 hours in 240 feet of water. What he remembers is cold,
foul-smelling air and the fear he tried to tamp down inside him.
</P>
<P>
   Another Squalus survivor, Gerald McLees of Portsmouth, N.H.,
said the crew remained calm, with ``no hysterics or anything like
that,'' in the pitch blackness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got in a bunk, covered up and tried to sleep,'' McLees, now
85, recalled. He said he was just following orders and trying to
conserve oxygen by limiting his movements.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In World War II, many subs went down, some with crews terrorized
through relentless depth-charge attacks. Physicians say that some
of the ways that men die on submarines _ like drowning or gas
poisoning _ are exceptionally painful.
</P>
<P>
   Once diesel subs began being used for spy missions in the Cold
War, their crews were vulnerable to being trapped.
</P>
<P>
   While nuclear-powered subs can create their own air when their
reactors are running, diesel submarines had to stick a pipe above
the waves each night to bring fresh air into the boat.
</P>
<P>
   So in the case of Smith's submarine, the USS Gudgeon, and a few
others, Soviet naval forces were able to keep them from
ventilating, creating conditions over one to three days that would
have been similar to what any survivors on the Kursk faced.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 63, who now lives in North Fork, Calif., said the men on
the Gudgeon kept up their spirits through a determination to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, after a nuclear-powered submarine, the USS Seawolf,
snuck into the Soviet Sea of Okhotsk on an extraordinarily
sensitive mission _ to tap an underwater communications cable and
retrieve pieces of Soviet missiles _ it was stuck in the sand for
nearly two days before it could power its way off the seabed.
</P>
<P>
   Some former crew members said one enlisted man lost control and
began screaming. A medic was ordered to sedate him.
</P>
<P>
   What has made the Kursk crisis so unusual and suspenseful is
that it sank in relatively shallow water. Other subs that have been
lost in the nuclear era, including two U.S. submarines, have
plunged more than 10,000 feet into the depths.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than have any hope of rescue, these men died nearly
instantaneously when their vessels imploded from the crushing sea
pressures.

FOR NEWS AGENCIES, POLITICAL CONVENTION'S `NO NEWS' ISN'T `GOOD
NEWS' 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ By the middle of the afternoon Wednesday, most of
the major World Wide Web news sites were no longer able to resist
the story of the stricken Russian submarine at the bottom of the
Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   While cable-news channels continued to feature drama-free images
from the Democratic National Convention, on the Internet the news
about the submarine had taken the lead position on the CBS, MSNBC,
Fox News and CNN Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``No Signs of Life'' was the Fox site's headline.
</P>
<P>
   Of the major network sites, only ABC continued to cling to the
convention as its news lead, offering the insight that, yes, now is
time for Vice President Al Gore and Sen. Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut to introduce themselves to the American people. That
was the boilerplate of the day, the theme emphasized on every
single one of the Web sites and by the cable news anchors.
</P>
<P>
   Most often, it quickly led to the unanswerable question: Would
Gore be able to rise to the occasion and make himself appear
sufficiently presidential to improve his poll numbers?
</P>
<P>
   The lack of drama in Los Angeles was perhaps best exemplified by
CNN's extensive coverage of the arrival of Gore's jet at Burbank
Airport. For what seemed like hours, Air Force Two taxied down the
runway and then sat on the tarmac, the camera focused on the dark,
gaping doorway, waiting for someone, anyone, to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks of watching _ first the Republican and then the
Democrat _ national conventions by flipping back and forth between
cable and broadcast channels, and surfing the Web, have shown how
the absence of news at the party conventions has often led news
organizations to depending on commentary to fill broadcast time.
</P>
<P>
   When news actually did break, like the clash between Los Angeles
police and a variety of protesters on Monday night outside the
Democratic National Convention hall, the tendency of most of the
channels was to show a few quick images and then to ask
commentators inside, who had no idea what was actually happening,
what they thought the clash meant.
</P>
<P>
   The Web, while promising a greater degree of immediacy and
immersion for political convention junkies, most often turned out
to be little more than electronic journals, closer to what might be
found in a weekly magazine than on a live television report.
</P>
<P>
   Many Web sites tried to make points by adding little games and
puzzles and quizzes _ and some of these were actually not half bad.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC, for instance, had a game called ``Electoral Chess,'' in
which an Internet user could predict which states each presidential
candidate might win in November and see if it would be enough to
get their candidate the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy Now had a protesters' version of Monopoly in which
users were offered the chance to ``buy a politician today!''
</P>
<P>
   Players could take the role of a major conglomerate and then
click through a series of windows. Web site users who picked AT&AMP;T,
for instance, learned that the corporation had $62.4 billion in
revenue in 1999, and had donated $2.9 million to the Republicans
and $1.5 million to the Democrats this year, and paid taxes
totaling $3.2 billion: ``Welcome to the White House,'' the final
window proclaimed. ``Thank you for your donations. You may drop by
anytime you want!''
</P>
<P>
   David Carr, writing on Inside.com, predicted how the major news
agencies would cover the Democratic convention, day by day.
Thursday's reports, he predicted, would center on the vice
president's efforts to finish writing his acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of the major papers in America will buy into the
transparent canard that Gore _ a man who does push-polling on his
choice of neckwear _ is working the speech all by his lonesome,
revising draft after draft deep into the night,'' Carr wrote.
</P>
<P>
   And the Web chats continued. ABC's Sam Donaldson, who has taken
to the Web with an eager-beaverness second to none, has chatted
incessantly every night of both conventions. When his guest Harry
Thomason, the Hollywood producer and pal of President Clinton,
asked Donaldson how many people were actually out there listening
to them jabber, Donaldson had to admit that he didn't really know,
but it was far, far fewer than were watching the networks.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter, though, Donaldson said. ``We are the acorn and
from this acorn will grow a mighty oak,'' he said.

CHENEY'S STOCK OPTIONS HOLD POTENTIAL FOR CONFLICT OF INTEREST 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This story has been added to Page 1 of The New York Times) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dick Cheney, the Republican nominee for vice president, retired
from Halliburton Co. with millions of dollars worth of stock
options that he cannot cash in until long after the new
administration takes office, the company announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has previously said he would sell his stake in
Halliburton before he took office, assuming the Republicans win the
election. But Cheney would not be allowed to sell the options,
which cannot be transferred except on death. As a result, he would
have to either abandon the holding or keep it until after the
election, thus giving him a large stake in the future success of
Halliburton while he is serving as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Dirk Vande Beek, a spokesman for Cheney, declined to say whether
Cheney would retain the options if he is elected. He quoted Cheney
as saying, ``I will do whatever the law requires. I will do
whatever I need to do to avoid any conflict of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton's stock fluctuates in large part due to changes in
oil prices. As a result, if he held on to the options, he would
stand to profit if oil prices rose, a factor that the
administration's energy policies could affect.
</P>
<P>
   The chief financial officer of Halliburton, Gary Morris, said in
a telephone interview that under the Halliburton stock option plan,
there was no way for Cheney to transfer the options, such as by
giving them to a charity, before they are exercised.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton said it would report an $8.5 million one-time
expense as a result of Cheney's departure. Morris said that covered
the value of the options and the restricted stock that had not yet
vested before Cheney retired, as well as an estimated bonus for
2000 that Cheney would receive if the company meets certain
financial goals that have not been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be roughly in the neighborhood of $1 million,'' said
Morris of the bonus. ``It is not a big number.''
</P>
<P>
   The company declined to give the value of Cheney's pension,
which is based on contributions made by the company during the five
years he worked for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney owns restricted stock and options to purchase stock that
have a current value, based on Wednesday's closing stock price, of
just over $54, or $39.6 million. In May he cashed in options on
100,000 shares of stock for a profit of $3 million. All that value
came from grants from the company during his tenure; he has never
invested any money in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's contract with Halliburton gave him the right to retire
after he reached age 62, but the board chose to waive that
provision for the 59-year-old former defense secretary. Had it not
done so, he would have forfeited options to buy 400,000 shares as
well as 140,000 shares of restricted stock. Morris said the company
calculated the value of them based on the assumption that they were
all sold at a stock price of $42.25, the closing value on July 25,
the day after Cheney was chosen as Gov. George W. Bush's running
mate.
</P>
<P>
   The stock has risen dramatically since then, however, and those
securities would now be worth $13.6 million, up from $7.7 million
on July 25. Moreover, because the options expire at various dates
from 2005 through 2009, the value of them would be much higher if
they could be sold, since a buyer would take into account the
possibility of future increases in the price of Halliburton stock.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, The New York Times reported that Halliburton board
members had been told the value of Cheney's package was $20
million. Morris said he was not familiar with that number, and said
he did not know how much the options package would be worth if
valued according to conventional options valuation models. In
previous Halliburton filings, the company has used assumptions that
would have valued the options as being worth more than $20 million,
but it was not clear what assumptions were used in estimating the
value of the package for board members.
</P>
<P>
   While the company did not give Cheney the right to exercise
options before he otherwise would have been able to do so, it did
remove the restrictions on 140,000 shares of stock. As a result, he
will be able to sell those shares whenever he wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 400,000 options that have not yet vested for Cheney
will vest in December, and thus could be exercised before the new
administration takes office on Jan. 20. But other options will vest
in December 2001 and others in December 2002. The value of those
options, if they could be exercised today, would be $3.8 million.
That value could rise substantially, of course, since those options
do not have to be exercised until 2008 and 2009.

BUT WILL `THE AL SHOW' PLAY IN PEORIA?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BUD KENNEDY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ Nobody remembers anymore that ``Frasier'' was
a spinoff of ``Cheers.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is hoping we forget that he is a spinoff of the Bill
Clinton presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Gore makes his big pitch Thursday night for a long-running show
of his own. For four years, he's played the dorky intellectual in
the rollicking Clinton comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of supporting actors in California, he wants to hit
the Hollywood big time. But first, he had to start out in Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   As a middle school mariachi band inexplicably played ``La
Culebra'' (''The Rattlesnake''), Gore emerged from Air Force Two at
the Burbank airport Wednesday and gave the crowd a little preview
of his proposed show.
</P>
<P>
   We'll see the pilot episode Thursday night. Call it ``The Al
Show,'' replacing this week's reruns of ``The Clinton Show'' and
``The Kennedy Show''.
</P>
<P>
   Gore says he wrote the script all by himself. In fact, he said
Wednesday that he used poster board and an easel to write down his
ideas, which makes me wonder whether he met with himself for
brainstorming sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, he told a sweaty but giddy audience in a steamy
airport hangar that he wants to bring America a ``positive
change,'' yet ``continue the prosperity and progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Do we need a new plot or more of the same story line?
</P>
<P>
   Both, says ``Frasier'' Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In Al's show, teachers will be treated ``like the professionals
that they are,'' he said without explaining. The minimum wage will
go up, doctors will run health care, the air will be cleaned up and
guns will be kept ``out of the hands of criminals _ and of
children'' with mandatory trigger locks.
</P>
<P>
   Gore promised a hard-hitting first episode Thursday night. He'll
focus on the ``specific hard choices'' facing voters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That would delight voters who otherwise see little difference in
Gore's show and its competition in the fall time slot, a remake
starring Texas Gov. George W. Bush in an updated version of a 1980s
hit.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush drew bad ratings in primaries last spring, his friends
were pleading with the directors to ``let George be George.'' It
worked.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Gore's friends plead with him. They want self-directed Al
to let himself be Al.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he should introduce himself,'' friend and Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman said Tuesday afternoon. Vice presidents are
such obscure characters that they require a new introduction,
Glickman said: ``He needs to tell the people where he wants to lead
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Glickman called Gore ``an extremely inquisitive man'' with ``an
extraordinary grasp of complex issues.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the problem: He's so complex, we don't understand where
he stands on many issues.
</P>
<P>
   (Bush poses no such puzzle.)
</P>
<P>
   If Gore has any bad words for Bush in his script Thursday night,
he will probably zero in on a subject where he and Bush obviously
follow a different story line: guns.
</P>
<P>
   Handgun Control hosted Democrats for a one-sided discussion
attacking Bush's gun law record Wednesday. Bush was blasted over
private sales at gun shows and because licensed Texans can pack
concealed handguns.
</P>
<P>
   None other than the secretary of Housing and Urban Development,
Andrew Cuomo, made Bush sound like a throwback to the Stone Age. He
said condescendingly that voters should elect the candidate with
``the intelligent position'' on guns, as if Bush and a majority of
Texas lawmakers are brainless lummoxes.
</P>
<P>
   That's not going to work for the Democrats. That's pompousness.
That's arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   That only works for ``Frasier.''
</P>

SPARED CHECHNYA, MOTHER PRAYS FOR A SON TRAPPED ON SEA FLOOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (With RUSSIA-SUBMARINE, RUSSIA-SUBMARINE-SURVIVE) 
 By SOPHIA KISHKOVSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KURSK, Russia _ Valentina Staroseltseva thought she was lucky,
because her draft-age son could have been sent to fight in
Chechnya, the worst nightmare of most Russian mothers.
</P>
<P>
   But her son, 19-year-old Dima, won a prestigious spot on the
Kursk, the navy's newest and most sophisticated nuclear-powered
submarine, named for the southern Russian city the Staroseltsevs
are from.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the submarine was so safe,'' said Staroseltseva as
she watched herself on television talking about her son, whose
dream of serving in the fleet has turned into a nightmare as
harrowing as anything in Chechnya. ``We called it our submarine. We
were 100 percent confident in it. We really believed in it.''
</P>
<P>
   So much so that young men from the region competed for the
privilege of serving on it, with three candidates for every spot
allotted to conscripts from Kursk. Dima, who had completed studies
at a railroad engineering school, made the cut.
</P>
<P>
   Since last weekend, the crippled Kursk has been lying on the
floor of the Barents Sea, 80 miles from Severomorsk, home base of
the Northern Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   In Kursk, Staroseltseva and the parents of six other local young
men are keeping an anxious vigil, surrounded by relatives and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   They are camped around television sets, silent and tense,
clenching their fists as the latest news reports speculate on the
crew's dwindling oxygen supply and discuss failed rescue attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The hopeful news Wednesday was that help from Britain was on the
way. The worry was that Russia had waited too long to accept help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am angry that we didn't let the British come sooner,'' said
Staroseltseva. ``I keep thinking about why we didn't take this
help. I as a mother want everything to be done faster and better.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking solace, Staroseltseva, a nurse, has been going twice a
day to the bright yellow church, which she attended with Dima, near
her house. She recalls the icon he was given by the bishop of
Kursk, who blessed Dima and the other draftees at their sendoff
last November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think maybe he is lying silently,'' she said. ``As a mother
I hope he is calm. The main thing is not to panic.''
</P>
<P>
   But to a neighbor and Dima's aunt standing in her kitchen, she
reveals greater fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this news is like a little stab, followed by a little
stab,'' she tells them. ``It would be better if it happened all at
once.''
</P>
<P>
   She now recalls that the head of the local military recruitment
office, who was close to Dima, tried to talk him out of serving on
the Kursk and urged him to serve on land, outside Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday she mailed Dima the pens he had asked for in his last
letter. When she returned home, the disaster was all over the news.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Staroseltseva patiently fielded telephone calls
and welcomed a stream of relatives and friends who came to the
tree-lined street of one-story houses. The Staroseltsev's brick
house stands at a dead end.
</P>
<P>
   She describes how her fears that her gentle son would not
withstand military life faded with each letter and each visit.
While the Russian military is notorious for its hazing and horrible
living conditions, Dima wrote that he was well fed and had no
problems with the officers or other conscripts. Draft-dodging is
rampant in Russia, but Dima wanted to serve in the military.
</P>
<P>
   The worried mother was convinced when she saw that after six
months her skinny boy had gained nearly 17 pounds. He wore his
gold-trimmed black uniform topped by a dashing greatcoat with great
pride.
</P>
<P>
   There are several pictures of Dima with his best friend on the
Kursk, Lyosha Nekrasov, 19, whose mother calls several times a day
to check in with Staroseltseva.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is frustrated by the conflicting reports on the
condition of the submarine and the state of the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``First they say there is enough oxygen only until the 18th,
then they say there is enough until the 25th, then someone else
says there is only enough for 72 hours,'' said Lyosha's mother,
Nadezhda Nekrasova, who called the Staroseltsevs late Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``First they say they knocked, now they say they're not
knocking,'' she said, referring to reports of signals being thumped
on the walls of the sub. ``My head is spinning.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, the family had received no calls from local
government or military officials.
</P>
<P>
   Staroseltseva's salary of about $40 a month is not enough for
train tickets to the north for her and her daughter, Inna.
</P>
<P>
   But with help from a local committee of soldiers' mothers, they
and the relatives of the other sailors on the Kursk are leaving by
train Thursday for Murmansk, near Severomorsk, a 45-hour odyssey
that will reveal whether their prayers for a miracle have been
answered.

Many of the nation's biggest law firms, inundated with more
business than they can often handle and pressing lawyers to raise
their billable hours to pay escalating salaries, have cut back on
pro bono work so sharply that they fall far below professional
guidelines for representing people who cannot afford to pay. Vera
Kennedy, 55, and her neighbors are frustrated by the lack of free
legal representation in their community. Kennedy's apartment is

 &HT;    NEW QUESTIONS WON'T SLOW MERGER, ADVOCATES SAY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Regulators this week hit America Online and Time
Warner with a new round of questions, but consumer advocates doubt
the queries suggest the government will slow the companies'
proposed merger.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) persistent
questioning is ``just part of a charade,'' said Mark Cooper,
research director of the Consumer Federation of America. ``We don't
believe the FCC is going to do anything'' to protect consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said FCC regulators typically ask many questions about
mergers, but then take little action. He pointed to the
commission's recent approval of AT&AMP;T Corp.'s $58 billion
acquisition of MediaOne Group Inc., creating a cable powerhouse
with relatively few restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   When the FCC commissioners examined that deal, ``they waltzed
AT&AMP;T around for awhile...but then they let them do whatever they
wanted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Butler, a spokesman for the Consumers Union, said the
FCC's inquiries into the AOL and Time Warner deal ``are serious and
important.'' But he added that ``the fact that the agency is going
through several rounds of questions is no indication'' the deal
will be curbed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates fear that AOL, the world's largest online
company, and Time Warner, a cable giant with 12.6 million
customers, will impose their services and content on captive
customers if they are allowed to join forces. For example, a
combined AOL-Time Warner could force cable customers to watch only
Warner Brothers' cartoons and take only AOL's Internet access, they
warn.
</P>
<P>
   They want the FCC to ensure that cable customers can get ``open
access'' to the content and services of many competitors, just as
phone customers can choose their long-distance company.
</P>
<P>
   The persistent questions about Time Warner's cable operations
have become so aggravating to some AOL executives that they want to
sell off the cable systems, according to a report Tuesday in
Inside.com, an online media and entertainment news service. The
article quoted unnamed industry sources as saying AOL executives
are uncomfortable with running a regulated business and would
prefer to focus on content and online services.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner spokesman Scott Miller dismissed that story, saying
the management of both AOL and Time Warner share an ``equally
strong'' commitment to the cable business.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocate Cooper said he believes a combined AOL-Time
Warner would sell off its cable operations only if the FCC were to
create an open access standard for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the FCC had established a regime of true open access, then
it would make sense to be a content company,'' he said. ``But it's
exactly the failure of the FCC to act that means (AOL and Time
Warner) aren't going to give up their wires.''
</P>
<P>
   The FCC is reviewing the transfer of Time Warner's broadcast
licenses to AOL. Since the merger was announced Jan. 10, the FCC
has been focusing its investigation on AOL's instant messaging
software and its interactive television platform, as well as on
Time Warner's exclusive contract with Road Runner, a venture that
provides high-speed Internet access via cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives for the two companies said they expect the FCC,
the Federal Trade Commission and the European Union to wrap up
their investigations in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased with how the regulatory review is proceeding,''
AOL spokeswoman Kathy McKiernan said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Time Warner were to sell off its cable holdings, it's
unlikely one company would be able to buy them all. AT&AMP;T, the
largest U.S. cable company, might have the deepest pockets in the
industry, but regulators, mindful of the AT&AMP;T-MediaOne merger, are
likely to be careful about a deal that would make AT&AMP;T even bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Other cable providers might be interested in pieces of Time
</P>
<P>
   Warner's cable pie. For example, Atlanta-based Cox
Communications could expand its San Diego market by acquiring the
Time Warner cable system next door.

MEETINGS SPARK TALK OF FUTURE TICKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Senator Joseph R. Biden was not coy about his
dates to speak to the New Hampshire and Iowa delegations this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've stayed out of national politics, but now I'm back in the
game,'' the Delaware Democrat said in an interview on the
convention floor. ``That doesn't mean I'll run again. Hopefully,
we'll have it'' _ the White House _ ``for another eight years. But
I'm back in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The 57-year-old Biden, who made a brief run for the 1988
Democratic presidential nomination before dropping out after a
series of missteps, is one of several prominent Democrats from Vice
President Al Gore's generation who are taking advantage of the
party gathering to meet with political leaders from the states that
choose the first delegates every four years. Just in case.
</P>
<P>
   While the Republican national convention moved monolithically to
the beat of Governor George W. Bush to the exclusion of any 2004
GOP hopefuls, the Democrats have not attempted to hide faces that
might show up on a future ticket.
</P>
<P>
   A host of senators as well as some 80 congressional candidates
have been given speaking opportunities from the convention podium.
One of the most conspicuous Democrats in Los Angeles is House
minority leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, who also ran for
the 1988 nomination and has never given up his national hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'd like to keep his options open,'' said Bill
Carrick, a Los Angeles political consultant who managed Gephardt's
presidential campaign 12 years ago. ``He's a national leader.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Carrick cautioned against making too much of Gephardt's
meetings with the New Hampshire and Iowa delegations. ``He spent
two years of his life in those states'' preparing for the 1988
campaign. ``He's visiting with old friends. He's really focusing on
winning back the House this fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the morning caucuses of the New Hampshire group have
become one of the busiest venues this week. The delegates are
hearing from Biden, Gephardt, Senator John F. Kerry of
Massachusetts, and Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean these men are making preliminary moves for 2004?
``Oh, God, no,'' said Kathy Sullivan, chairwoman of the New
Hampshire Democratic Party. ``Every one of them has a lot of
friends in New Hampshire. Gephardt is helping in one of our
congressional races. Biden has old friends from '88. Dodd has
always had a strong connection with our state. He was up for a St.
Patrick's Day parade and spoke at a Democratic event in Manchester
earlier this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, a neighbor and a finalist for the vice presidential slot
this year, spoke to the Granite State delegation Monday. ``He came
and talked about Al Gore,'' Sullivan said, instead of himself.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the appearance of ambitious Democratic figures at
the New Hampshire and Iowa events invariably stirs speculation.
</P>
<P>
   After Governor Gray Davis of California hosted a party here for
Governor Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire before the convention got
under way, the event encouraged the idea that Davis might have his
eyes on a higher prize in 2004. But Shaheen said Davis, a colleague
in the Democratic Governors Association, ``actually did it at my
request'' to help her state party.
</P>
<P>
   The officials who are spending time with the New Hampshire
delegation, she said, ``have relationships with the state. We're
not reading anything into this.''
</P>
<P>
   The delegation from Iowa, which traditionally selects the first
convention delegates in a statewide caucus, will be visited by
Gephardt and Biden. Both spent months in the Midwest state during
the early stages of their presidential campaigns. In fact, Gephardt
won the Iowa caucus in 1988, turning him into a nationally known
figure.
</P>
<P>
   But Tom Miller, Iowa attorney general, said there was nothing
overt about their appearances this year. ``They simply have a lot
of friends in the state,'' he said.

ANALYSIS: LIEBERMAN MUST DOWNPLAY PAST POLICY DIFFERENCES WITH
GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was a new-model Joseph Lieberman, hurriedly
retooled to the specifications of a national campaign, who took the
stage here Wednesday night as the presumptive Democratic vice
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   No advocacy of school vouchers or the partial privatization of
Social Security, no criticism of affirmative action. No untrimmed
edges that might keep the party's core voters from supporting Al
Gore. Nothing that might dramatize the candidates' differences
rather than their agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Al Gore for 15 years,'' Lieberman said in his
prepared remarks, which were released before he spoke. ``I know his
record and his heart. I know him as a public servant and I know
what it is like to sit with him around the dining room table. We
have discussed _ sometimes even debated _ policy issues. And we
have shared private moments of prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the world of the vice presidential candidate (and the
vice president, for that matter), where the rules are simple:
Praise your master and mute your own views.
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of his record, some people might have expected
something a bit more unconventional, from Lieberman, the
Connecticut senator, though probably unrealistically.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton was a master at reconciling differences among
Democrats of varying stripes. But as William Daley, the chairman of
the Gore campaign, noted the other day, wearing his best Buster
Keaton deadpan, ``Clinton is not on the ticket this year.'' And
Gore has trouble enough with the party's base without getting into
more because of Lieberman's views.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of Democratic skittishness on this point that
Lieberman has backtracked on several points of importance to the
constituencies that the ticket needs to re-energize. But the
rejiggering could be costly.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has a bit of a reputation for flip-flopping and
corner-cutting on issues like abortion and trade. Former Sen. Bill
Bradley, Gore's opponent during the primaries, accused him in
January of ``using words in a very tricky manner.'' Gov. George W.
Bush, the Republican nominee, mocked Gore for having voted one way
on guns in the 1980s and another in the 1990s, adding, ``When it's
convenient politically, he changes his tune.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic strategists hoped that Lieberman, who refused to
buckle when colleagues tried to dissuade him from criticizing
Clinton's sexual misconduct, would lend the ticket some
stand-by-your-guns luster. Much of that could be lost if Lieberman
seems to be bending to political expediency at this stage.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman began attacking that problem when they
visited the vice president's home town, Carthage, Tenn., almost a
week ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me,'' said Lieberman, ``when President Gore decides,
Vice President Lieberman will support him wholeheartedly.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president responded: ``I think it's a strength and not
a weakness, an asset, not a liability, to be able to have a
different point of view represented in the room at the time that
decisions are being made.''
</P>
<P>
   But that, they seem to have concluded since, was not quite
enough.
</P>
<P>
   There was a day when presidential nominees chose running-mates
who provided ideological balance. In 1952, Adlai Stevenson, a
Northern liberal, chose John Sparkman, an Alabama conservative, and
in 1976, Jimmy Carter, a Southern conservative, chose Walter F.
Mondale, a Minnesota liberal. But like so many old norms in U.S.
politics, that has gone by the board.
</P>
<P>
   This year, ideological identity is the real goal for the
Democratic ticket, much as the party may have flaunted its
ideological diversity in ``Liberals' corner'' Tuesday night. Vice
President Al Gore not only selected someone from roughly the same
segment of the party as he _ both have been stalwarts of the
centrist Democratic Leadership Conference _ but he and his aides
have sought to make sure Lieberman fell into line on all the major
issues.
</P>
<P>
   That took some doing, because on some issues, his position was a
bit to the right of Gore's. Not that Lieberman is a right-winger,
or anything resembling one. He may have had doubts about
affirmative action, for example, but he will be the first person
ever chosen for a national ticket who went to Mississippi to show
racial solidarity in the dark days of 1963.
</P>
<P>
   But take the matter of vouchers issued to parents by the federal
government, to be used to pay their children's tuition. In his time
as Connecticut's junior senator, Lieberman sponsored legislation
establishing experimental programs for vouchers. He voted for such
programs on at least four occasions. But vouchers are anathema to
the American Federation of Teachers and the 2.5 million-member
National Education Association, a pair of powerhouses that are
expected to pour money and manpower into the Gore campaign this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   What to do? After he was named by Gore, according to a report in
The Wall Street Journal, Lieberman called Sandra Feldman, the
leader of the teachers' federation, and promised that a
Gore-Lieberman administration would be resolutely anti-voucher.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Lieberman voiced support for Proposition 209 in
California, a ballot initiative that ended racial and gender
preferences in state university admissions. The same year, in a
Senate floor speech, he said ``affirmative action is dividing us in
ways its creators could not have intended,'' and added: ``If you
discriminate in favor of one group on the basis of race, you
thereby discriminate against another group on the basis of race.''
</P>
<P>
   Statements like that helped to win Lieberman a reputation as one
of the least partisan, most civil and most thoughtful members of
Congress. But not among African-Americans, one of the groups Gore
must count upon.
</P>
<P>
   So this week Lieberman visited the Congressional Black Caucus to
assuage its members' concerns. ``I have supported affirmative
action,'' he told them. ``I do support affirmative action. And I
will support affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, he has retreated from the idea of allocating some
percentage of Social Security funds for investment by individuals _
a proposal, known as partial privatization, at the heart of the
Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in 1998 with the Copley News Service, Lieberman
said, ``I think in the end that individual control of part of the
retirement-Social Security funds has to happen.'' Gore stoutly
opposes that.
</P>
<P>
   But almost immediately after he was chosen by Gore, the senator
released an unpublished op-ed article entitled, ``My Private
Journey Away from Privatization,'' written at the behest of the
Gore campaign. In it, he said that the promises and the numbers
supporting the proposal ``don't add up.''

FEDERAL OFFICIALS SAY THEY WILL TOUGHEN STANDARDS FOR TIRES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Facing growing criticism that regulators should
have spotted problems with Firestone tires sooner, federal
officials said Wednesday that they were working on tougher tire
rules, particularly for sport utility vehicles and other so-called
light trucks.
</P>
<P>
   State Farm, the nation's largest auto insurer, said Wednesday
that it had sent an e-mail message to regulators in July 1998,
alerting them that it had received 21 claims involving Firestone
tire failures over the previous 6 1/2 years. The insurer's
officials also mentioned the problem during a routine telephone
discussion of pending safety issues with regulators a year ago,
said Stephen Witmer, a State Farm spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford Motor Co., which installed on its Ford Explorer sport
utility vehicles most of the tires now being recalled, has
acknowledged that it recalled some Ford Explorers overseas with
identical tires last year but did not tell the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration, which is part of the Transportation
Department. The agency decided in the 1980s that its legal
authority did not extend to requiring reporting of overseas
recalls, and automakers stopped doing so voluntarily a decade ago,
said Joan Claybrook, the agency's administrator during the Carter
administration and now the president of Public Citizen, an advocacy
group.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators also no longer collect data directly from repair
shops on safety defects, a program that used to provide early
warning of safety issues. The agency maintained contact with an
extensive network of repair shops in the 1970s but allowed it to
disappear in the 1980s, when the agency's budget was cut in half by
President Ronald Reagan, who criticized the agency as an example of
excessive regulatory zeal.
</P>
<P>
   Safety agency officials defended their handling of the Firestone
tire problems Wednesday, saying that they had acted in a timely
manner once a pattern of consumer complaints to the agency had
emerged. The agency's current lawyers share the view of their
predecessors in the 1980s that there is an ``extraterritoriality
exemption'' implicit in the agency's statutes that prevents the
gathering of data on overseas recalls involving autos and auto
parts also sold in the United States, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Neblett, an agency spokeswoman, said that no one at
the agency Wednesday could recall having heard of any warning from
State Farm. But she cautioned that one agency employee who keeps
track of such warnings was not in the office this week.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' lawyers also criticize the agency for not using its
subpoena powers to demand from them various documents that they
have obtained from Ford and Bridgestone/Firestone, a unit of
Bridgestone of Japan. The lawyers got them during the discovery
process of various lawsuits. The lawyers are prevented from sharing
the information openly because the companies labeled the documents
as trade secrets in providing them.
</P>
<P>
   But Rae Tyson, also an agency spokesman, said that the agency
was confident that it would obtain all relevant documents through
its own requests to Ford and Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   While continuing to study what went wrong in the 6.5 million
Firestone tires being recalled, regulators are starting to look at
how to draft new rules for tire design.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen R. Kratzke, the safety agency's associate administrator
for safety performance standards, said that new rules were needed.
More Americans are driving sport utility vehicles and other light
trucks, and Americans have been driving faster after the repeal of
the national speed limit of 55 mph, he said.
</P>
<P>
   High-speed travel puts more strain on tires. And tall vehicles
are more likely to roll over if they lose a tire, making it
particularly important that their tires are reliable, Kratzke said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``There's no question from looking at our data that a light
truck is more prone to roll over than a car'' when a tire fails,
Kratzke said. Virtually all of the 62 deaths attributed to tires so
far in reports to regulators were on sport utility vehicles that
rolled over.
</P>
<P>
   The current safety test for high-speed driving requires that car
tires not fail when driven on a machine for half an hour at 75 mph,
half an hour at 80 mph and half an hour at 85 mph. For off-road
tires and heavy-duty tires for large pickup trucks, the test is
conducted at a speed 5 mph slower for each of the half-hour tests.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the complaints involving the Firestone tires, which were
certified to the car standard rather than the off-road standard,
involved incidents that occurred during highway driving at a
minimum of 55 mph. Kratzke said that he was studying a requirement
that off-road tires and possibly heavy-duty tires meet the same
standards as car tires, and that all of these tires pass a test of
at least 100 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The safety agency began studying the problem of Firestone tires
in February, when a Houston television station's report on tire
problems prompted several dozen people in Texas to report similar
trouble to regulators. The agency opened a formal investigation in
May, its 20th by then in 2000 alone, after accumulating 90
complaints involving four deaths.
</P>
<P>
   All but two dozen of the complaints came in this year, even
though the Explorer has been on sale since 1990 and a handful of
lawsuits citing tire failures were filed as early as 1993. With
national attention on the problem, the number of complaints to
regulators has soared to more than 750, involving more than 100
injuries and at least 62 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Witmer of State Farm said that the insurer had repeatedly
collected money from Firestone over the last three years after
contending that manufacturing defects in the tires made the tire
maker, and not State Farm, responsible for covering the cost of
claims. Firestone paid the first of these claims, for $9,700, in
October 1997, he said. State Farm's moves were first reported
Wednesday by The Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Karbowiak, a Firestone spokeswoman, said that the tire
maker frequently paid claims from insurers because it was cheaper
than contesting them.
</P>
<P>
   Allstate and Farmers Insurance, the nation's second- and
third-largest auto insurers, respectively, said that they were not
aware of a problem with Firestone tires until the last two weeks.
But both insurers said they were reviewing their records in
anticipation of filing possible claims with Firestone.

<P>
   IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS NATIONAL FOREST, N.H. _ Over slick
boulders and thick roots, across narrow bridges and through mud
that coated their limbs, three hikers in wheelchairs and two on
crutches won a 12-hour struggle up the Gale Head trail here Tuesday
to reach a mountain hut that naysayers had said they would never
use.
</P>
<P>
   The moral being, said one hiker: Do not tell us where we will
not, and can not, go.
</P>
<P>
   Their destination, the Gale Head hut at an elevation of 3,800
feet, has just been rebuilt by the Appalachian Mountain Club.
During its construction, some club members and New Hampshire
newspapers ridiculed the idea of making the rustic 38-bed lodge
accessible to the handicapped, complete with a ramp and ``grab
bars'' in bigger toilet stalls. It was an absurd waste of money,
they said, because no one in a wheelchair was ever going to get
over the super-rugged 4.6-mile trail.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. Under their own power, but also helped mightily by
family, friends and volunteers who pulled, pushed and tipped them
over boulder after boulder, the three hikers in wheelchairs reached
the wood-shingled hut at sunset _ and, with the happy exhaustion of
any hiker and then some, rolled up the welcoming ramp to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The hikers' achievement, and the controversy that spurred it,
highlighted a broader phenomenon in the country's wilderness areas:
a push to make everything from outhouses to campgrounds more
friendly to disabled people _ and the debate it sometimes raises
over the wisdom of trying to make the naturally hard-to-get-to
outdoors more accessible.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Forest Service officials say they have no plans to pave
trails or significantly change wilderness areas to conform to
federal disability rules. But, said Janet A. Zeller, who oversees
the agency's push for accessibility, ``When you get to a
person-built facility, you're beyond what nature has put there for
you, and you're into what people have built, and therefore it needs
to meet a standard so that when you get to a structure, you know
what to expect. It's that `Whew!' at the end of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   The national forests in the service's Eastern Region, which
ranges from Maine to Minnesota and Missouri to West Virginia, spent
$2 million in the last year and $18 million in the last eight on
improving accessibility, Zeller said, and has been working on
general guidelines for outdoor access.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Gale Head hut, Appalachian Mountain Club
officials estimate they paid an extra $30,000 to $50,000 for a
building that was already costing about $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   But New Hampshire is a flinty-spirited state, and the
modifications to the hut were pricey because they were last-minute:
the mountain club learned only belatedly from the Forest Service
that the hut, even though it is among the club's remotest, must
comply with the accessibility rules for new buildings in the
Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the club's leadership did not mind. Walter Graff,
the group's deputy director, said that the hut ended up with a
better overall design, including widened hallways, a porch and the
elimination of steps up to the bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The AMC is about bringing people to the outdoors,'' Graff
said. ``The fact they're in wheelchairs or otherwise disabled
shouldn't prevent that.''
</P>
<P>
   But others did mind, or at least raised challenges. A local TV
reporter asked why, if people in wheelchairs could drag themselves
up the trail, they could not drag themselves up steps to the hut.
One Appalachian Mountain Club member wrote to the group's magazine,
``So what does a tired hiker see when he gets to the hut? A
wheelchair ramp. Any reasonable person is going to be shocked, then
bemused. What a waste of money.'' Another said that the federal
disability rules could be read to mean that all trails should be
paved, and demanded, ``When will AMC start to fight such insane
regulations instead of meekly acquiescing?''
</P>
<P>
   At Northeast Passage, a program at the University of New
Hampshire that works with people with disabilities, news that the
hut would be accessible at first prompted casual plans to try to
go, said Jill Gravink, the program's director.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Then, when the criticism started coming out, ``All of a sudden
it was, `Hey, we have to make this trip,''' she said. ``Nicole
Haley rolled into my office with a newspaper article and said, `I'm
doing this, are you guys coming?''' They took it as a real slap in
the face, like, `Who are you to tell me I can't do this? How do you
know how much of my own sweat I'm willing to put into getting up
there?'''
</P>
<P>
   (As for the TV reporter, Gravink said she responded, ``Why
bother putting steps on the hut at all? Why not drag yourself in
through a window?'')
</P>
<P>
   And so, after almost a year of planning, with organization by
Northeast Passage and help from We Media, an advocacy media group
for people with disabilities, along with other sponsors, the hikers
set off at about 7:30 a.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The three who used wheelchairs were trying out special Terra
Trek-brand models engineered for the most rugged terrain; they and
their helpers had devised a variety of tested but still
experimental tricks, from long poles that could let helpers lift
the wheelchairs almost like rickshaw bearers, to tethers that let
helpers pull the chairs like oxen, to simple planks that could be
laid over brook crossings or rough ground.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Krill, a ski instructor and hotel clerk whose 60-year-old
father, Phil, helped push and pull his wheelchair, said that in
making the trip, he wanted to show people in wheelchairs that they
could get out and enjoy the woods, though not necessarily on such
difficult trails.
</P>
<P>
   The trail started out relatively gentle, though every root,
every rock demanded effort that able-bodied hikers would never
think about. Early on, Craig Gray, a management consultant and
Paralympic cross-country skier, took a tumble in his wheelchair
down a hill, but the teams of helpers quickly learned how to keep
their wheelchair athletes upright.
</P>
<P>
   By about 10 a.m., the going got slower, and at about 10:30 came
the one sour note of the day: a hiker who cursed at the group for
blocking the trail and said he thought the whole thing was
ridiculous, adding an expletive for emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   After lunch by a rushing river came the hardest part: the
infamous boulder-staircase known as Jacob's Ladder, with rounded
rock steps big enough to get any hiker huffing. The group tried a
modified Tyrolean traverse, lifting the wheelchairs off the ground
with ropes and letting their occupants pull themselves upward with
a pulley system.
</P>
<P>
   It worked, but not well, and the hikers in wheelchairs went back
to other techniques, including the move that Gray called the
``butt-up,'' in which he simply sat with his back facing the
boulder staircase and lifted himself from step to step using upper
body strength.
</P>
<P>
   Each wheelchair-hiker developed a different style. At one point,
the group around Nicole Haley, who has used a wheelchair since she
fell off a ladder two years ago, resorted to singing ``You've Lost
That Loving Feeling,'' to keep its strength up, and sent renditions
over walkie-talkies to other groups. Gray's team had a slightly
macho style, using exhortations like ``Let's eat that rock!''
</P>
<P>
   All reached the hut at sundown, too tired for ringing
pronouncements, having completed in 12 hours what takes an average
able-bodied hiker 3 1/2. Though Souley Marzouk, who was one of two
who made the trek on crutches, together with Dr. Susan Murray, did
say: ``This shows how determined we are, and how far determination
can take you. It wasn't easy but I guess we figured it wasn't going
to be, and that's why we did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon everyone went inside to the cozy wooden warmth for potato
soup and cheese steak _ and champagne _ at the hut's long tables.
They were to spend Wednesday relaxing at the hut, and Thursday
facing a whole new challenge: the way down.
</P>
<P>
   Would the hut's ramp ever really be used again? Would they ever,
really, want to do this again, after all the almost-tipping and
rib-bruising and grueling labor? Sure, said Krill, 29. ``Next time
I can get enough people to do it with me.''

USC LOADED AT LINEBACKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ For 10 days and nights, Zeke Moreno and Markus
Steele have spent nearly every hour together at USC training camp.
</P>
<P>
   They are constantly standing next to each other on the football
field, going through every linebacker drill. When finished, they
are roommates in a campus apartment at UC Irvine, with their free
time usually spent talking to each other.
</P>
<P>
   But they have never discussed the one subject that seems so
obvious. The one that USC is trumpeting across its media-guide
cover, with a photo of the pair sharing equal billing, and the
words ``Butkus Award Candidate'' atop their names.
</P>
<P>
   ``That conversation hasn't come up once,'' a surprised Steele
said. ``That's funny, not once have we talked about it.''
</P>
<P>
   It would seem a natural subject for two of the hands-down best
linebackers in the Pacific-10 Conference. Unless you really know
them.
</P>
<P>
   They both have a quiet coolness that doesn't crave large amounts
of public attention or hype. Moreno is more outgoing with the
media, but no one confuses him with R. Jay Soward, and he is more
apt to politely ask reporters how they are doing before answering
questions about himself.
</P>
<P>
   Steele is low-key in most public situations, becoming more
outspoken around close friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I'm louder than Zeke. I express my feelings,''
Steele said. ``He is the quiet one. I'm the loud one.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not that simple. Moreno is the one who holds the
defense together on the field, calling signals and assuming
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``The linebackers are the quarterbacks of the defense,'' Moreno
said. ``If someone slacks off, I have to step up and tell them.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Steele: ``He'll show it on the field and tell guys we have
to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele is a more traditional lead-by-example personality.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they are a reason USC is ranked 15th in the nation and
considered to have perhaps the best defense in the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   The pair is identical in one respect: their desire to stay on
the same page this season. They want to win football games, and all
this Butkus Award talk doesn't mean much if the Trojans stumble
through another 6-6 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both proud and know how hard each other works,'' Moreno
said. ``It's a team game. If he wins the Butkus and we win the
Orange Bowl, I'll be happy. And vice versa.''
</P>
<P>
   The two also have fairly easygoing personalities, which allows
them to live together without getting on each other's nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always know Zeke has my back on things I do wrong,'' Steele
said. ``And I have his back. We'd have a big problem if we didn't
get along. You have to be eye to eye to play together.''
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't their ability to blend that makes them special.
Each has a penchant for big plays, with Steele coming off the edge
at weakside linebacker and Moreno plugging up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel they have an opportunity to be the cornerstone
of our defense,'' linebackers coach A.J. Christoff said.
</P>
<P>
   That means each has to raise his level of play, especially when
compared to USC's 1998 Butkus Award winner - middle linebacker
Chris Claiborne.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of fine-tuning we've been working on,''
Christoff said. ``You can be a good college football player, but
the room for improvement is great. Both players understand what
their weaknesses are and what they have to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   There's reason to believe each will be better. Especially
Steele. He spent half of last season playing with an injured
shoulder that limited his mobility. He suffered the injury against
Notre Dame, but it really was a reoccurrence of an injury he
suffered at Long Beach City College.
</P>
<P>
   In January, he had surgery to repair his shoulder and it feels
fine for the first time in two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``My shoulder is 100 percent and I can smash like anybody
else,'' Steele said. ``Now I can hit with both shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   If he's healthy, he should also be able to practice full-time.
If there was a weakness to Steele's game last season, it's that he
didn't always understand his assignments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Markus wasn't able to always get (proper) reads because he
couldn't practice because he had a lot of injuries,'' Christoff
said. ``He played on instinct and ability. Now, he's learning to
read within the context of the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Steele admits he has a lot to learn this season from
Christoff, who was hired after Shawn Slocum resigned to return to
Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shows us how to do things right,'' Steele said. ``How to
read linemen better with his technique. That's what I need to
learn.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Moreno, he finally has a full season on his resume of
playing in the middle. His sophomore year, he was forced to play
outside linebacker while Claiborne manned the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had big shoes to fill with Chris gone,'' Moreno said.
``People didn't know what to expect from me. People didn't know
what my ability was. It's my turn to take control in situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're as confident as we've ever been, but that comes
with our experience. But I need to work. Just because I'm getting
more publicity doesn't mean I think I'm a better player.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be the key to success for both players. Christoff
believes each benefits from the poise they display on the practice
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sign of a skilled player is one that shows emotion when
you're in a game but can practice and improve his skills without
that high emotion,'' Christoff said. ``These kids carry out
assignments without needing to be on an emotional high.''
</P>
<P>
   They have also adapted to change. Both embraced the arrival of
Christoff before the biggest year of their careers, without
bitterness over the departure of Slocum, who stunned USC last
winter when he abruptly returned to work for his father, Texas A&AMP;M
coach R.C. Slocum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position coach is fun. He's more of a player. He laughs
and listens and jokes with us,'' Steele said. ``It was a great
change.''

 &HT;    Sluggish trials show U.S. has work to do
 &HT;    By Mike Tierney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Sure, the U.S. swimmers looked sharp on the
starting blocks in their newfangled bodysuits. What about the
bodies wearing those back-to-the-future outfits once they dove in?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to improve,'' Richard Quick said of his women's
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great combination of youth and experience,'' said
men's coach Mark Schubert.
</P>
<P>
   America's two coaches, sitting side-by-side, peeked ahead to the
Games in Sydney with contrasting outlooks Wednesday as the pool was
finally drained on the final night of the Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   Quick worried that only one U.S. woman _ Brooke Bennett in the
800-meter freestyle _ has floated to the top of the world rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the athletes who have the ability (to win) in most
events,'' he said. ``We will have to swim better than we have in
our lives to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Schubert expressed delight over a youthful turn by the male
side, with eight teens qualifying _ seven more than in Atlanta a
quadrennium ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``These young guys showed a lot of presence here,'' he said.
``They didn't seem overwhelmed.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Schubert might have been wearing rose-colored glasses
and Quick dark, foreboding shades. Though a team stocked with guys
who need fake IDs to buy a drink bodes well for Athens for 2004,
Schubert might be overly optimistic. Quick's side, more
star-studded, is better equipped to ward off host Australia and
help the U.S. remain the chlorined kings and queens of the swim
world.
</P>
<P>
   That's how an Aussie advance scout sees it.
</P>
<P>
   ``On balance, it looks to me as though we should be in front in
the male swimming,'' said Forbes Carlisle, a note-taking coaching
legend from Down Under. ``When it comes to female swimming, it's a
different matter.''
</P>
<P>
   If the guys need chaperones, the women's team is available. It
is older than ever, best illustrated by Dara Torres, 33, back from
a seven-year hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's being accepted more by society and by athletes and their
families that your career isn't over after high school,'' Quick
said.
</P>
<P>
   Torres is at the forefront of a trend among veterans ingesting
creatine and other health supplements. The substances are not on
the IOC banned list, but their long-term after-effects are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Quick, who personally coaches a strong stable that includes
Torres and two-time trials winner Jenny Thompson, has appointed a
specialist to monitor the swimmers' intake. ``I didn't want to
stick my head in the sand,'' said Quick, acknowleding that swimmers
are aware of drugs, legal or not.
</P>
<P>
   No world records were lowered at these Trials. None was set in
1996, either, and the Americans managed 13 golds (seven women, six
men) at the Games.
</P>
<P>
   As for the tepid times, several reasons were proffered:
</P>
<P>
   _ The shift of the Trials from March to August, designed in part
to keep all contenders training together during the summer, had
many focused on a roster spot rather than a record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we might have more (records).'' Quick said. ``It may
be that the focus truly is on Sydney. If your goal is (just) to
make the team, we won't have as successful an Olympics as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, both coaches welcomed the late-summer trials
dates. Schubert noted that springtime injuries could heal and
younger candidates had more time to develop.
</P>
<P>
   _ The elongated Trials. Schubert noted that NBC-TV requested
that races at the Games be stretched out over eight days, and U.S.
Swimming felt obligated to mimic the schedule here. Also, in some
events, qualifying rounds were added.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to keep your adrenaline and enthusiasm up for eight
days,'' said Schubert, referring chiefly to swimmers in multiple
events.
</P>
<P>
   A spent Thompson, after winning the 100 and 200 freestyle,
withdrew from the 50 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   _ The overcrowded conditions. Qualifying standards for the
Trials are set low, largely to ensure full hotels in the host city
and fulls rows of parents, grandparents and siblings in the stands.
The warm-up pool often was I-285 at rush hour, prompting sprinter
Tom Dolan to complain that he was more conscious about kicking a
14-year-old in the head than preparing properly for his race.
</P>
<P>
   Quick noted that Olympic warm-up pools are equally chaotic.
``This helps you prepare for the Games,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ The bodysuits. Yes, the outfits that made males look like
modern-day Buster Crabbes and females dressed more modestly than
night-clubbers were not a cure-all.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some, the bodysuit is a very good thing,'' Schubert said.
``It's unfortunate people didn't have more time (to adjust).''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence is needed, he said, to match suits _ knee or calf
length? backless or not? _to body shapes and specific events. Some
swimmers did not know whether to soak the suits before slipping
into them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury,'' said Quick, ``is still out.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said of the U.S. team.

   LOS ANGELES _ Jon Corzine, New Jersey's Democratic nominee for
the U.S. Senate, gave an energetic speech on the floor of the
Staples Center Wednesday in his debut on the national stage. But
hardly anyone saw it.
</P>
<P>
   His own state's delegates were off having lunch at an Irish pub.
A half-dozen Corzine campaign workers rounded up obliging partisans
from Maine, New Hampshire and Minnesota to fill New Jersey's seats,
wave signs, howl at the applause lines and chant his name.
``Cor-ZEEN!'' a few shouted, until they were corrected.
</P>
<P>
   It was, after all, only a little after 1 p.m., California time.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Corzine, whose name is pronounced COR-zyne, said he had
enjoyed his moment under the lights, despite having felt
``butterflies'' beforehand. And this has been a very different
convention for him. In 1996, when he was merely the co-chairman of
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., he spent only one night with the Democrats in
Chicago. After giving more than $150,000 to the party and raising
much more than that from others, he was rewarded with a skybox seat
during President Clinton's acceptance speech, the week's most
anticipated event.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Corzine's schedule has been grueling and mostly
unglamorous: As official head of the New Jersey delegation, he has
to sit through each morning's two-hour program of political
speeches over breakfast at the New Jersey contingent's hotel. And
he is doing his best to sell himself to local political leaders who
opposed him in the primary, as well as to journalists who have
criticized his campaign spending.
</P>
<P>
   But at times, Corzine still seems to be treated more like a
well-meaning fund-raiser than a political force in his own right.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's largesse toward New Jersey Democrats did not stop at
the airport in Newark. For example, he put together $37,500 to buy
250 tickets to the postconvention concert on Thursday starring
Barbra Streisand, Enrique Iglesias and others, a benefit for the
Democratic National Committee. And he is throwing a lavish party
for the delegation at Luna Park in West Hollywood after the
concert.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine gave a smaller, private luncheon on Sunday in Santa
Monica, where he was greeted by Sens. John Kerry, Charles Robb and
Tom Daschle as if he were already a colleague. Supporters say there
is reason to be sanguine: Internal polls, they say, show him as
much as 16 points ahead of his Republican rival, U.S. Rep. Bob
Franks.
</P>
<P>
   The luncheon provided another stark contrast between the two
campaigns. At the Republican convention in Philadelphia, Franks
spent his days clamoring for attention, pleading for $1,000 checks
and arranging for events around the country that he hopes will
attract wealthy donors to invest in his candidacy despite the
possibility that he could be outspent by Corzine by as much as 5 to
1.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, meanwhile, had no trouble drawing such deep-pocketed
Democratic givers as Eli Broad, the billionaire largely responsible
for luring the convention to Los Angeles, and Preston R. Tisch of
the Loews Corp. conglomerate, to his luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   But he let his audience know that he did not want its money for
himself. Rather, he asked for contributions to New Jersey's
coordinated campaign, which officials say will spend more than $4
million on combined efforts on behalf of the party's presidential,
congressional and even local races.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New Jersey, the candidate running may be able to do some
things for himself in his own campaign,'' Corzine said in a
third-person understatement. ``We have the ability to make sure
Corzine 2000 does fine. But we work as a team; it's a seamless
thing. I hope when I come knocking on your door in the next few
weeks, you'll know it's not for Jon Corzine.''
</P>
<P>
   In his three-minute speech Wednesday, Corzine touched on
familiar issues but without the liberal language that characterized
his primary campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a time of tremendous prosperity,'' he said, ``a
time when Democrats have transformed record surpluses from record
deficits. It is our duty to use this prosperity to address the
unmet needs of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   But he made no mention of his platform, which calls for heavy
spending on health care, long-term care and education programs.
Instead, he said, ``We must be bold in responding and proposing
ideas that fit within our means and pay down the debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Two aides to Franks, who managed to obtain convention passes
from someone they called a ``sympathetic New Jersey Democrat,''
seized on Corzine's toned-down rhetoric as inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't say `universal' once,'' said Michael DuHaime,
Franks' deputy campaign manager. ``He spent $35 million promising
universal this and universal that, and now he's backing off.''

DEMOCRATS READY TO MEET CHALLENGES, LIEBERMAN SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH AND JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After riding a 10-day wave of publicity for
breaking a religious barrier, vice presidential candidate Joseph
Lieberman said Wednesday night the Democratic ticket is ideally
suited to tackle the next frontier, ``the differences that are
still between us.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after assuring black Democrats that he supports
affirmative action, Lieberman, the first Jew on a major-party
national ticket, told a nationwide television audience that he and
presidential nominee Al Gore are committed to improving conditions
for all Americans. It was intended as an answer to Republican
presidential nominee George W. Bush's charge that the Democrats
have failed to use prosperity for a greater social purpose.
</P>
<P>
   While only indirectly referring to his Jewish faith, Lieberman
wove a direct link between the story of how his wife's parents
escaped the Holocaust and ``the remaining walls of discrimination
in this nation based on race, gender, nationality or sexual
orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's why I continue to say, when it comes to affirmative
action, `mend it, don't end it,'' he said, borrowing a phrase from
President Clinton to underscore his commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my life, I have tried to see this world through the eyes of
those who suffered discrimination,'' Lieberman said. Introducing
himself to millions of voters for the first time, the Connecticut
senator portrayed himself as a man who rose from humble beginnings,
the son of a bakery truck driver.
</P>
<P>
   He also displayed a wit well-known in Washington but perhaps
surprising to many in the national audience. ``There's an old
saying that behind every successful man, there's a surprised
mother-in-law,'' he said, describing his selection as the Gore's
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a gibe at Republicans for portraying themselves as a
diverse party during their convention, he said, ``Let's be honest.
We may be near Hollywood, but not since Tom Hanks won an Oscar has
there been that much acting in Philadephia. I am glad the GOP
changed their rhetoric, but I wish they would also change their
policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his speech, Lieberman spoke respectfully of his GOP
colleagues, but invoked the refrain that ``I'm sad to say'' that
Bush's policies aren't working. ``I'm sad to say that in Texas, the
qualify of the air and water is some of the worst in Ameica.''
</P>
<P>
   Invoking a metaphor that has drenched this convention for days,
Lieberman said John F. Kennedy's call for a ``New Frontier''
remains as fresh as it was 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next frontier isn't just in front of us, but inside of us,
to overcome the differences that are still between us, to break
down the barriers that remains, and to help every American claim
the limitless possibilities of our own lives,'' Lieberman said in
remarks prepared for delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Left unspoken was another parallel to Kennedy's acceptance
speech at the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles 40
years ago. Kennedy, who at the time was seeking to be the first
Catholic elected president, used his speech to assure voters that
he was his own man and wouldn't take direction from the Vatican.
Lieberman has been outspoken in declaring that his faith is central
to his philosophy, revealing that he prayed with Gore when the vice
president asked him to be his running mate. Lieberman also opened
his speech in Nashville with Gore last week by quoting from the Old
Testament.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, 58, provided an instant spark to the ticket when Gore
picked him on Aug. 7. Gore seemed energized and much of the media
reaction was positive, including cover stories in Time and
Newsweek, that described Lieberman as a moral leader with solid
experience.
</P>
<P>
   As the first Democratic senator to publicly condemn President
Clinton's affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky,
Lieberman may have helped Gore distance himself from Clinton.
Earlier Wednesday, as Gore greeted Lieberman at the Burbank
airport, the vice president said, ``Let others argue the case for
the old guard. We're the new guard, and we're going to bring
positive change to the United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who served 16 years in Congress and is in his eighth year
as vice president, did not describe who represented the ``old
guard.'' Indeed, his comment came after a parade of liberal
leaders, who might be considered the ``old guard,'' addressed the
Democratic convention on Tuesday night. They included Senator
Edward M. Kennedy, former Senator Bill Bradley and the Reverend
Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Making the case for change is one of Gore's biggest challenges.
Despite the economic prosperity during the Clinton-Gore
administration, polls show that most voters want change. Thursday
night, Gore plans to try to separate himself from Clinton even
farther by outlining what he called ``some specific hard choices I
believe we have to make in order to ensure that we have a bright
future.''
</P>
<P>
   As is traditional for a vice presidential candidate, Lieberman
used his speech both to attack the Republicans and praise his
presidential running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good thing that our opponent talks about
education,'' Lieberman said. ``But I'm sad to say their plan does
not provide the resources our school need to meet those high
standards. I've read their plan. To me, it seems like their idea of
school modernization means buying a calendar for every building.
</P>
<P>
   After that biting critique, Lieberman lavished praise on Gore.
``I know his record and I know his heart,'' the senator said. ``I
know him as a public servant and I know what it is like to sit with
him around the dining room table. We have discussed _ even debated
_ policy issues. And we have shared private moments of prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Some believe Gore's speech Thursday night could make or break
his campaign. The vice president is often caricatured as either a
plodding, programmed speaker, or a podium-pounding shouter.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, speaking to reporters on Air Force Two, said he is ``very
relaxed'' about his speech _ and was still working on it. ``I've
been rewriting and editing and tweaking,'' Gore said. He said the
speech would ``give a clear idea of what my agenda is for the
country...the ideas and proposals I'm making are rooted in the
experiences I've had in fighting for people over the last 24
years.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lieberman has been hailed as an exciting and supportive
partner to Gore, he also brings some risk to the ticket. As the
first Jewish politician on a presidential ticket, no one knows if
some voters will object once it's time to cast their vote.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Lieberman's centrist views have ruffled liberals,
African Americans and Hollywood donors. For example, the
Connecticut senator's support for a pilot program for private
school vouchers in Washington, is anathema to teachers, who help
form the backbone of Democrats' traditional grassroots support.
Lieberman said shortly after being selected for the vice
presidential slot that he now grees with Gore's opposition to
vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   But if there was worry among the delegates about Lieberman, it
was mostly muted. He has been embraced by the most visible black
leaders in the party, including the Reverend Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Johnson, the mayor of Jackson, Mississippi, is an African
American who considers himself a progressive. The delegate,
speaking on the convention floor, described Lieberman as a good
choice and himself as satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``The senator has explained and clarified his positions to the
extent people have concerns,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The big question was how Lieberman's initial appearance on the
national stage would resonate with the public, especially more
liberal voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lieberman is more of an asset than a liability because he
generated a huge amount of favorable attention,'' said John J.
Pitney, a government professor at Claremont McKenna College here.
``But there is a downside. The party's progressive wing is not
entirely happy with him. Unfortunately for Gore, they do have
someplace to go, Ralph Nader.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, and in some key battleground states, Nader has been
eating into Gore's support by 5 to 7 seven percentage points, polls
show.

HEARING IN NUCLEAR SECRETS CASE TURNS INTO DEBATE ON INTENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ What was supposed to have been a simple
hearing Wednesday on whether a scientist accused of mishandling
nuclear weapons secrets should be released on bail turned into a
bitterly contentious preview of his trial.
</P>
<P>
   Bail hearings are generally brief, with decisions usually
rendered with relative speed. But this is the third bail hearing
for Wen Ho Lee, a former nuclear weapons scientist at the Los
Alamos National Laboratory, and as it moves into a second day it
has illustrated the unusual gulf between what is in the 59-count
indictment and what the government contends that Lee actually
intended.
</P>
<P>
   He is charged with illegally moving the secret data to an
unsecure computer and portable computer tapes, some of which are
missing, with the intent to harm the United States. The government
has said further that Lee, 60, had been motivated largely by a
desire to find a new job _ most likely with an American ally _ and
intended to use the tapes to enhance his prospects. But most of the
bail hearing on Wednesday, and a previous one in December, focused
on the question of espionage, of which he is not accused.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the issue is the significance of the trove of
nuclear data that Lee is accused of downloading. Two witnesses
appeared in federal district court here on Wednesday _ John
Richter, a former top nuclear weapons designer and intelligence
official at Los Alamos, and C. Paul Robinson, the president of the
Sandia National Laboratories, another government weapons facility.
</P>
<P>
   Richter, who is highly familiar with the obscure computer codes
that Lee is accused of downloading, said that perhaps 99 percent of
the information had already been made public in various forums and
would not be that useful to a foreign country. Asked if national
security would be harmed if the tapes found their way into foreign
hands, Richter replied, ``I don't believe that it would have any
deleterious affect at all.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robinson maintained that if the tapes landed in hostile
hands, the global balance of power could be shifted. ``I've never
seen anything even close to it in approximation of the potential
damage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing is scheduled to continue on Thursday before Judge
James A. Parker.

 &HT;    Selection of top 12 could start a ruckus
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The 15 women and 16 men competing in the U.S. Olympic
Gymnastics Trials took a ``team'' picture Wednesday on the floor of
the Fleet Center. By Sunday night, the photo will resemble one from
the television show ``Survivor:'' faces crossed out of all but six
men and six women, the rest voted off by committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that everybody has the best interest of the U.S. team
at heart,'' said Augusta gymnast Jay Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Atlanta Olympics, the gymnasts with the best combined
scores from the national championships and the Olympic trials made
the team. This go-round, the entire women's team and the final two
men will be selected by a committee to maximize the group's
strength in each event.
</P>
<P>
   Bela Karolyi, brought out of retirement to coordinate the
women's program, and three others will choose the women's team
based on performances at training camps, last month's nationals and
the trials. They're supposed to reveal the Olympians 10 minutes
after the competition ends Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not have controversy,'' Karolyi promised as the
national championships concluded in St. Louis. ``I mean, there's
going to be some crying, some moaning. You know, that's the
sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Dantzscher says she has caught Karolyi watching her during
workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of gymnasts are intimidated by Bela,'' she said.
``I'm not. Why put that extra pressure on yourself? There's already
so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Dantzscher, Elise Ray, Kristen Maloney and Vanessa Atler are
part of the new generation of gymnasts, while Shannon Miller,
Dominique Dawes, Dominique Moceanu and Amy Chow return from
Atlanta's Magnificent Seven. Moceanu hurt her knee Tuesday, but
says she will still try to compete Friday night, when the
competition begins.
</P>
<P>
   This year, new rules only allow a Mag Six. ``I think that kind
of stinks,'' Dantzscher said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is trying for her third Olympic team. Although Karolyi is
an unabashed admirer of her skills, she doesn't want anyone
thinking she'll get a free pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, I'll be in the top six and there won't be any
question about it,'' she said. ``The last thing I want is a
controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   But what if Miller is seventh and leapfrogs over someone who
places higher?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone wants to be in that situation,'' she
said, ``but no one wants to be left home, either.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Kim Kelly threatened to sue after placing sixth at the
trials, then losing her spot on the team. The federation appeased
her with a free trip to Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   The selection procedure, said USA Gymnastics president Bob
Colarossi, ``is meant as an insurance policy if some unfathomable
or unintended consequence happens.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, top U.S. hopeful Dan Hayden had such a poor final
routine that he missed the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   Said Colarossi, ``We can't let that happen again.''

 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sen. Joseph Lieberman continued his efforts
Wednesday to win the full support of the liberal wing of the
Democratic Party as one of its prominent members, the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, went before the New York delegation to praise the historic
alliance between Jews and blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Against a backdrop of low-level grumbling by members of the
party's traditional base about the Democrats' centrist ticket and
platform, Lieberman visited in quick succession with leaders of
three important constituency groups _ gays and lesbians, Hispanics
and Asian Pacific Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   And at nearly the same time, Jackson told New York delegates
that Vice President Al Gore's selection of Lieberman as his running
mate was a bold expression of affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, he said, ``broke the quota of zero to make sure an
American Jew would be on the ticket. That's what affirmative action
is. It breaks the barriers of exclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson appeared as delegates here were buzzing about an
editorial in The Amsterdam News, the major black newspaper in New
York City, suggesting that Gore had selected Lieberman as a way of
currying favor from Jewish contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson made no direct mention of the editorial, and his
advisers said that discussion of relations between Jews and blacks
was not in response to it. Nonetheless, Jackson's affirmation of
relations between blacks and Jews during the past 20 years drew a
long and loud standing ovation from delegates.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference, Jackson said that he did not share the
view of the newspaper's publisher, Wilbert Tatum, but he declined,
in response to repeated questioning, to condemn Tatum's views.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any language that would threaten our unity is not helpful,''
Jackson said, ``but in a free speech society, we cannot stop people
from talking, whether you agree or disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's remarks, and Lieberman's efforts to reach out to
members of minority groups, underscored complicated dynamics within
the Democratic Party that have slowly surfaced since Lieberman was
selected. It has exposed tensions between the liberal and centrist
wings of the party, as well as between blacks and Jews. Lieberman,
while proudly emphasizing his heritage, said Wednesday that he
hoped people would vote for him because of his qualifications, not
because of his religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're asking people to forget about the history,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During Lieberman's round of caucus visits, he wooed members with
old-fashioned political appeals, reminding them of votes he has
made in support of their pet causes, promising future support. But
he also sought to establish a more personal connection by
repeatedly linking his heritage as an Orthodox Jew with the
cultural resistance that members of all minority groups have faced
throughout the country's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say,'' Lieberman told the Asian Pacific Islanders
caucus of the Democratic National Committee, ``that when I look out
on this room I see the faces of my grandparents and my parents, and
I see the story of America. What a remarkable turn of events to
find Al Gore to have had the courage to break the barrier he did by
picking me.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is,'' he added, ``that once barriers fall for one
group, the doors of opportunity open wider for all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's appearances Wednesday extended a highly public
fence-mending campaign that he began on Tuesday when he met with
the black caucus. Lieberman, a leading member of the centrist New
Democrats, has faced questions from liberal Democrats about his
criticism of some affirmative action programs and his support of
experimental programs to give school vouchers to children in
low-income neighborhoods. On Tuesday he reassured the black caucus
that he would support affirmative action, and Wednesday he spoke to
all three groups about the need for equal opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the promise of America,'' he said. ``We're not looking
for a guaranteed outcome. Just give us a guaranteed opportunity and
we'll work hard enough to earn the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the caucus visits, Lieberman displayed a relaxed,
self-effacing manner. When he was introduced to the Hispanic
caucus, he joked about opening a kosher-Latino restaurant with such
fanciful dishes as ``gefilta fish serviche.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Lieberman was anxious to solidify his relationships with
these groups, they, too, seemed ready to embrace the Gore-Lieberman
ticket. He received enthusiastic receptions from all three
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Asian group stood and chanted ``We want Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   During his meeting with the gay and lesbian caucus, a man yelled
``We love you, Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic caucus cheered him wildly and some members held up
signs that read, ``Viva Gore-Lieberman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I could get used to this,'' Lieberman joked.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Lieberman has pledged not to engage in harsh,
partisan attacks against the Republican Party, and Wednesday he
largely abided by that promise. He barely mentioned the Republican
nominees, George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my best friends are Republicans,'' he quipped at one
point.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he remarked some criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   Republican policies, he said more than once Wednesday, would
only ``squander'' the current prosperity, and he ridiculed the GOP
itself as ``the same old crowd'' _ intolerant, white, rich and
unrepresentative of America's diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They worked hard to create an appearance of inclusiveness on
the platform in Philadelphia a couple of weeks ago,'' he said.
``But at this convention, the inclusiveness and diversity are on
the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Tuesday, Lieberman said that part of his job
as a running mate included re-introducing Gore to the electorate.
On Wednesday, he worked hard at fulfilling that role. He described
their 12-year friendship, and recalled how they have often talked,
argued and prayed together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this man,'' Lieberman told the Hispanic caucus,
referring to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in Al Gore,'' he told the Asian caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, Lieberman described his selection as a window
into Gore's values and character. ``Al Gore said more about
himself, his trust in the American people, than he did about me.''

   LOS ANGELES Democratic vice presidential candidate Joseph
Lieberman, the first Jewish American nominated for a major party
ticket, told the Democratic National Convention Wednesday night
that the Gore-Lieberman team wants to extend the American dream to
those left behind _ including Texans, who he claimed were suffering
bad air, water and schools under Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The 58-year-old senator from Connecticut offered ``some straight
talking'' about Republicans, delighting convention delegates with
the quip that the Republican presidential nominee idea of school
modernization is ``buying a new calendar for every building.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman delivered his nationally-televised address as
Democratic delegates formally nominated the Gore-Lieberman ticket
to carry the party's banner against Bush, in his second term as
governor of Texas, and Dick Cheney, the former defense secretary
turned oil services company executive.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman criticized Bush's record in Texas on air quality,
water purity and the absence of health insurance for large numbers
of women and children. He dismissed the Republican National
Convention two weeks ago in Philadelphia as pure theater, saying:
``We may be near Hollywood, but not since Tom Hanks won an Oscar
has there been that much acting in Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who credits the late President John F. Kennedy with
drawing him into public service, laid out the next step of the
Democrats' cherished ``New Frontier'' that was enunciated here in
Los Angeles by Kennedy in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the next frontier isn't just in front of us but
inside us to overcome the differences that are still between us ...
and to help every American claim the limitless possibilities of our
own lives,'' Lieberman declared. He quoted Vice President Gore to
the effect that ``It's not just the size of our national feast that
is important but the number of people we can fit around the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, a graduate of Yale and Yale law school who was the
first in his family to attend college, recounted his humble origins
as the grand child of immigrants. His late father had lived in an
orphanage as a child, later drove a bakery truck on the overnight
shift and eventually owned a liquor store. Lieberman added:
``Sometimes I try to see this world as my dad saw it from his
bakery truck.'' He said his proud, 85-year-old mother sitting in
the convention hall ``never felt younger than she does today.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman called Gore ``a man of family and faith...a man of
courage and conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberman's wife, Hadassah, the Czech-born daughter of Holocaust
survivors, introduced her husband to the convention as a principled
public servant ``shaped +by the values that are his heart and
soul'' who also remained ``just a regular Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   An hour before Lieberman's speech, waves of protesters occupied
the streets outside the Staples Center, the site of the convention.
Waving ``New Trial for Mumia'' and ``Nader for President'' signs,
they formed human chains as police nervously lined up on either
side.
</P>
<P>
   Through a bullhorn, police gave the protesters 15 minutes to
leave the intersection. They complied and _ for the moment _
averted a repeat of mass arrests that occurred Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier at an airport rally welcoming Gore and his wife Tipper
who arrived in the Los Angeles area Wednesday afternoon, Lieberman
mischievously told more than 1,000 supporters crowded into a
airport hanger to escape punishing sunshine: ``I've been waiting
for a week to say this line and I can't control myself anymore, _
in this election, will you help me win this one for the Tipper?''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, a veteran of nearly 12 years in the Senate, told Gore
that Democrats were eager to embrace his leadership, saying: ``As
I've walked the floor of the convention and spoken to the
delegates, this is a convention that believes in you and loves
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore set the stage for his own acceptance speech to the
Democratic faithful on Thursday night by vowing to lay out the
``specific hard choices'' that face the nation to harness the
nation's booming prosperity to bolster Social Security, improve
public education, provide prescription drug coverage to senior
citizens and get ``guns out of the hands'' of children and
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let others make the case for the old guard,'' Gore declared.
``We're the new guard and we're going to bring positive change to
the United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Late polls showed Gore and Lieberman have their work cut out for
them. A Voter.com-Battleground tracking poll of likely voters
released Wednesday showed the Bush-Cheney ticket leading the
Gore-Lieberman ticket by 9 percentage points, 49 percent to 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's eldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, 27, a graduate of
Harvard and Columbia law school who often accompanies her father on
the campaign trail, nominated her father as president with touching
recollections of her father's help building a dinosaur diorama,
icing down an igloo for an overnight winter camp out and his
willingness to heartily embrace ``our big plans.'' She said her
father was a ``man of faith in the most gutsy, practical sense''
who ``wants to see goodness prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiff's address followed a well-received speech on Tuesday
night by Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, the 42-year-old daughter and
last direct relative of slain President John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., who would become
speaker of the House with a Democratic takeover of the House on
Nov. 7, made a pitch for a change of leadership in the House which
in recent years has been wracked by strident divisions between
Republican leaders and minority Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders ``don't communicate _ they dictate,''
declared Gephardt, an ally of organized labor who had been on
Gore's list of prospective running mates. ``Democracy deserves
better. Hear me: We will replace `my way or the highway' with `Our
way together,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates responded with a chant: ``Take back the House!
Take back the House!''
</P>
<P>
   California Gov. Gray Davis, in an indirect reference to Bush,
stirred delegates by telling them that Gore was ``not some
back-slapping good old boy. He is a serious man of substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollster Frank Luntz, who advised the independent presidential
bid of Texas billionaire Ross Perot in 1992, said Gore's selection
of Lieberman paid off it ``caused people to take another look at
Gore,'' helping to cut Bush's lead over Gore from 19 percentage
points to 2 percentage points. Luntz, who also advised then-Rep.
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., on the 1994 campaign manifesto ``Contract
with America'' that helped the GOP to retake the House and Senate
for the first time since 1954, said Lieberman helps Gore win back
politically conservative Jewish Americans _ 40 percent of whom had
voted for Ronald Reagan in 1984. There are roughly 5.5 million Jews
in the United States, 10 percent of whom are Orthodox Jews.
</P>
<P>
   For Lieberman, his acceptance speech was a culmination of sorts
of a journey that began 58 years ago when he was born in Stamford,
Conn. His father, Henry, owned a liquor store, and his mother,
Marcia, raised him and his siblings as Orthodox Jews. Since
election to the Senate in 1988, Lieberman has fashioned himself
into a moderate-to-liberal lawmaker best known for occasional
stands against Democratic doctrine, including support for publicly
funded ``vouchers'' for private schools, opposition to affirmative
action and condemnation of the entertainment industry's
exploitation of sex and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was the first Democratic senator to publicly condemn
President Clinton's sexual dalliance with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky. William Bennett, the self-styled chief Republican
morals guru, described Lieberman as ``the closest thing in the
Senate to an Old Testament prophet.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who ceases work on the Jewish Sabbath on Saturday,
says he will continue honoring the Sabbath and on three Jewish
holidays in the weeks before the Nov. 7 election. ``I'm just going
to do what I've always done and work extra hard on the days that
I'm campaigning,'' Lieberman said before his address.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's selection of Cheney also gave the GOP nominee a boost,
enabling Bush to boost his margin by 10 percentage points, from 6
percentage points before he chose Cheney to 16 percentage points
after the selection.

   Children raised in families with stepmothers are likely to have
less health care, less education and less money spent on their food
than children raised by their biological mothers, three studies by
a Princeton economist have found.
</P>
<P>
   The studies examined the care and resources that parents said
they gave to children and did not assess the quality of the
relationships or the parents' feelings and motives.
</P>
<P>
   But experts said that while the findings did not establish the
image of the wicked stepmother as true, they supported the
conclusion that, for complex reasons, stepmothers do invest less in
children than biological mothers do, with fathers, to a large
extent, leaving to women the responsibility for the family's
welfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being raised by the biological mother gives children a lot of
protection,'' said the chief researcher on the studies, Anne Case,
a professor of economics at Princeton. ``It's a very big thing to
ask someone to care for children instead of the birth mother, who,
as the sociobiologists tell us, invests so heavily in carrying the
child, nursing the child.''
</P>
<P>
   The studies took their data from two of the broadest, most
respected surveys of Americans' households, income, spending and
health habits. While those surveys were not created to analyze
stepfamilies, their information is detailed enough to allow
comparisons between different kinds of families.
</P>
<P>
   Among children over 1 year old, living with both biological
parents, the health study found that 61 percent have had a medical
checkup within the last year. But among those living with a
stepmother and birth father, that number dropped to 46 percent _
and of those whose biological mother was dead, only 35 percent had
seen a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Of the children living with their biological parents, 74 percent
wear seat belts almost all the time, compared with 63 percent of
those living with a stepfather and biological mother and 52 percent
of those living with a biological father and stepmother.
</P>
<P>
   Families with a stepmother reported overall household food
spending that was about 5 percent lower for each stepchild than in
families in which both biological parents were present, the food
study found.
</P>
<P>
   In families in which women care for both their stepchildren and
biological children, the biological child, on average, went to
college for a year, while the average stepchild did not go to
college.
</P>
<P>
   Children reared by a stepfather also have lower educational
achievement than those reared by both biological parents, although,
as in most other measures, the negative effect is only about half
as much as with stepmothers.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Frank Furstenberg, a sociologist of the family at the
University of Pennsylvania, said that he did not question the
findings and believed that the studies raised important questions,
but he noted that stepfamilies vary widely.
</P>
<P>
   For example, women who take on a 2-year-old child step into a
role very different from that of women who care for a 12-year-old
stepchild, and for all stepmothers the relationships evolve as the
family becomes better established.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think most stepmothers are evil,'' Furstenberg said.
``If they're less involved, if they take a step back, it may be for
the most noble motives, to give the parent more room, to decrease
the tension. They may be relying on the child's father when perhaps
their trust is unwarranted.''
</P>
<P>
   With more than half the nation's children living apart from at
least one biological parent by the time they reach 18, the
functioning of stepfamilies has become increasingly important. Most
stepfamilies involve stepfathers, rather than stepmothers, and
compared with families in which a single mother is rearing a child
alone, the presence of the stepfather and his income help raise the
family's standard of living.
</P>
<P>
   Still, previous research has shown that children who did not
live with both of their parents had bleaker futures: among other
things, they were more likely to drop out of school, become
delinquents or engage in early sexual activity and drug abuse than
children raised by both parents.
</P>
<P>
   But while those outcomes are well known, there has been almost
no research on the care, attention and resources such children
receive _ and therefore, no way to know whether the damaging
effects reflect poor parenting, family instability, lack of money
or other factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What seemed important to us was looking at the input, which
hasn't really been done,'' Case said. ``For example, on the lower
educational achievement, there was always the question about
whether it was because stepmothers were less-able parents or the
household was unstable. But now that we know it's not that, since
the biological children of those same women, living in the same
house, are more likely to go on to college.''
</P>
<P>
   Many stepmothers are quick to acknowledge that being a
stepparent is complicated, particularly when they take on older
children and that it is unrealistic to imagine that the new bonds
will be the same as those between a biological parent and child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very important, going into a stepfamily, to
understand that family integration is a process that takes four to
seven years,'' said Carol Albano-Lutz, a stepmother and
psychoanalyst in Woodcliff Lake, N.J., who treats mostly children
and adults in stepfamilies.
</P>
<P>
   And, Albano-Lutz said, in part because society generally holds
women responsible for family welfare, the most difficult process of
family integration involves the stepmother.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Sasse of Chesapeake City, Md., vice president of the
International Stepfamily Association, a nonprofit group, said:
``What I hear from new stepmoms all the time, especially with older
kids, is, `They just hate me. They don't want to give me a chance.
They think I'm taking their dad.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sasse is no longer in touch with her own stepmother, from whom,
she said, she ``learned everything a stepmother shouldn't do,'' a
lesson that became valuable three years ago when she married a man
with a 2-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have custody of all the kids,'' she said. ``I have a
wonderful relationship with my stepdaughter. But it does make a
difference that she has a biological mom out there. I'm a female
influence, but I'm not her mother. You have to respect that a
stepchild has that other parent.''
</P>
<P>
   Just what effect that other biological parent has, at least in
terms of health care, was one of the surprise findings of the
Princeton research.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected that children living with stepmoms would have less
health care if they were still in contact with the birth mother,''
Case said, ``because the stepmom might not know if the birth mother
was taking care of it, or might be getting some message from the
birth mother like, `No, you're not going to take my child to the
dentist.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But we found just the opposite,'' she said. ``Where
stepchildren had contact with their biological mother at least two
or three times a month, they had the same health care status as
children who lived with both biological parents. Having a birth
mother hovering was protective.
</P>
<P>
   Case said she initially expected that having a stepmother would
be better for children than having no mother at all, but her
findings showed that children reared solely by their biological
fathers did as well on health measures as children with
stepmothers.
</P>
<P>
   The education and food studies are based on data from the
University of Michigan's Panel Study of Income Dynamics, and the
health data from the Child Health Supplement to the National Health
Interview Survey, both nationally representative surveys of
thousands of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Case, the authors of the education and food
studies were I-Fen Lin of Bowling Green State University in Ohio
and Sara McLanahan of Princeton. Case conducted the health study
with Christina Paxson of Princeton.

   ATLANTA _ ``I'm winning this thing,'' Sean Kenniff, a.k.a. Mr.
Clueless, announced right before he was voted off the island on
Wednesday night's ``Survivor,'' leaving four castaways for next
week's million-dollar finale.
</P>
<P>
   Sean had it right earlier when he said of his island mates:
``This is the most conniving bunch of people I've ever met in my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Wiglesworth avoided almost certain exile by winning the
immunity challenge. She characterized the group as she drank the
beer she won earlier during a reward challenge mud bath (where was
banished cutie pie Colleen Haskell when we needed her?): ``We're
not evil. We just play bad people on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   The remaining four bad actors:
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hatch: The one we most love to hate; a TV casting
director referred to him as ``Heather Locklear on `Melrose Place.'
'' Openly gay and brazenly manipulative, Richard concocted an
alliance that's kept him on the island despite being its most
despised citizen. He summed up Wednesday: ``Maintaining some kind
of thumb on all these people's personalities who I care very little
about is exhausting.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Boesch: The coot. Politically incorrect (hopes friends back
home don't think he's ``queer'' for associating with Richard), this
72-year-old ex-Navy SEAL with his scruffy gray beard and snarling
impatience looks like a survivor. For those handicapping the
winner, Rudy's the perennial sleeper. But he appears to be losing
it: during Wednesday's immunity challenge, we wondered if he
remembered his name.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Hawk: The toughie. Often as unlikable as Richard, and
occasionally in touch with her feminine side (like when she
befriended Kelly and cried). A Wisconsin truck driver, Susan tells
it like it is _ to anybody, usually to gain an advantage. For her
and Richard, surviving is high-stakes poker.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Wiglesworth: The waffler. Sometimes this 23-year-old
Nevada river guide appears ready to play on somebody's team; other
times she acts like a free agent. She's escaped banishment more
times than Rudy's griped about ``lesbians.''

CONVENTION PROTESTERS SHIFT THEIR ATTENTION TO LOS ANGELES POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
   By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A fourth day of street protests, this time against
corruption and brutality in the Los Angeles Police Department,
proceeded in relative calm Wednesday, with a few thousand
demonstrators chanting slogans like ``L.A.P.D., you can't hide, we
charge you with genocide'' as ranks of officers looked on
impassively.
</P>
<P>
   The day began with a march to the department's Rampart Division
station house, where 37 demonstrators were arrested after they sat
down and blocked the entrance to building. Rampart is the division
involved in the city's worst corruption scandal in a decade: more
than 20 officers have been implicated in fabricating evidence and
framing innocent suspects.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of demonstrators later moved from police headquarters
near City Hall to the Staples Center, where the Democratic National
Convention is meeting.
</P>
<P>
   As the protesters neared the center, some blocked an
intersection, resulting in a minor clash with police. Some
demonstrators tossed bottles, while officers used batons to force
the crowd back.
</P>
<P>
   In all, nearly 200 protesters have been arrested, most of them
on misdemeanor charges, since the demonstrations began on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Eidinger of the Midnight Special Law Collective, a legal
support group for protesters, said perhaps 40 percent of those
arrested were declining to give their names, hoping to bargain for
reduced charges, a tactic that protesters also employed in
Philadelphia at the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Despite temperatures in the 90s and unusually high humidity, the
crowds and the police largely remained cool.
</P>
<P>
   This week of protests has proved to be just the latest challenge
for a police department already under fire on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   California judges have dismissed 100 cases in which evidence was
tainted in the Rampart investigation, and in a separate
investigation, the Justice Department has accused the police of
systemic misconduct and threatened a federal civil rights lawsuit
if the city does not agree to changes in police training and
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   As police officers videotaped them, protesters carried signs,
including one reading ``To Serve and Protect Rich White People,'' a
mocking twist on the police department's slogan, ``To Serve and
Protect.''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters demanded an independent civilian investigation
into the Rampart accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the local chapter of the American Civil Liberties
Union said it would file a civil lawsuit in federal court accusing
the police of harassing journalists and firing rubber bullets at
least one free-lance photographer during a confrontation after some
protesters became violent at the end of a rock concert outside the
Staples Center on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dangers here, both physical and constitutional, are
grave,'' said Ramona Ripston, the group's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   But police commanders again strongly defended their response to
the demonstrators as measured and appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   In a briefing Wednesday morning, the department's spokesman,
Cmdr. David Kalish, showed photographs of cans of lighter fluid,
aerosol sprays, plastic Easter eggs filled with gasoline and other
makeshift incendiary devices, that he said officers had confiscated
from about 45 demonstrators who were protesting the fur trade and
banging on a window at a downtown store on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Terry McAuliffe, the chairman of the Democrats' convention
committee, expressed satisfaction at the police performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been fine,'' McAuliffe said. ``L.A.'s put on a great
show.''

 &HT;    LIEBERMAN WON'T HELP, HURT GORE IN THE SOUTH
 &HT;    By TOM BAXTER
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Thursday morning the Georgia delegation is
scheduled for a visit from one of this convention's stars, Hadassah
Lieberman. After her husband's speech Wednesday night, and
considering her compelling personal story, she can expect a warm
reception.
</P>
<P>
   But how well will Sen. Joseph Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew from
Connecticut, play in the South this November?
</P>
<P>
   The likely answer is that, Florida excepted, Lieberman's
presence on the ticket isn't going to help Al Gore in those
Southern states where he trails George W. Bush. But he isn't likely
to hurt, either.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes delivered what will be the operative line in the
South last week when he referred to him as a ``northern Sam Nunn.''
</P>
<P>
   The sort of conservative-leaning Democratic centrism Barnes was
referring to was on display in Lieberman's speech, which included a
list of notable presidents that surely is unique at a Democratic
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``As every faith teaches us, and as Presidents from Lincoln to
Roosevelt to Reagan to Clinton have reminded, we must as Americans,
try to see our nation not just through our own eyes, but through
the eyes of others,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic running mate took the Republicans to task on
issues from education to health care to finance reform. He jabbed
the GOP for what he described as a Hollywood-style performance at
its Philadelphia convention, and borrowed Sen. John McCain's
``straight talk'' line.
</P>
<P>
   But interestingly, this running mate's speech was not as sharply
partisan as Dick Cheney's two weeks ago. Using the rhetoric of the
Senate, he referred to his opponents as ``our Republican friends,''
and called them ``decent and likeable men.''
</P>
<P>
   The only Bush line he admitted to being angered by was the
Republican's charge that the current administration has left the
country with a ``hollow military.''
</P>
<P>
   On balance, it did seem a very Sam Nunn-ish sort of performance.
``I think Lieberman is going to play better in the South than
people expect him to,'' said Herb Mabry, a Georgia delegate and
past president of the state AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   Labor, he said, should go ``all out'' for Lieberman, despite a
generally conservative voting record.
</P>
<P>
   One particular area of concern is how Gore's running mate will
play among African-American voters, crucial to Democratic victories
in the South. One of Lieberman's biggest tasks this week has been
to win the favor of Rep. Maxine Waters of Los Angeles, who had
expressed doubts about his voting record.
</P>
<P>
   But Curley Clark, a Mississippi delegate and president of the
Pascagoula NAACP, said he thought African-Americans ``will not be
as skeptical as some whites,'' because his nomination knocks down
another historical wall of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Hall, a Florida delegate from Miami, said Lieberman will
have double advantage in her state.
</P>
<P>
   Not only should Lieberman boost turnout among Jewish Democratic
voters in South Florida, but he enjoys good relations with Cuban
Americans. She said the Cuban-American National Foundation,
generally a reliable supporter of Republican candidates, reportedly
may not endorse in this year's presidential election.

   Hewlett-Packard reported quarterly earnings that beat analysts'
estimates, driven primarily by strong sales of personal computers

GEPHARDT PROMISES BIPARTISANSHIP IF DEMOCRATS TAKE BACK THE HOUSE.
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JUDY HOLLAND
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, in an
overture to Republicans and independents, promised Wednesday that
if the Democrats win control of the House in November and if he
becomes speaker next year, he will lead the chamber with humility
and bipartisanship.
</P>
<P>
   He aroused cheers from delighted delegates at the Democratic
National Convention when he started his speech by shouting: ``Al
Gore will be elected and we will take back the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he told the crowd and a prime-time television audience, ``I
promise you that if we win a majority, we will be humble about our
beliefs and listen to the beliefs of others,''
</P>
<P>
   Pounding both fists on the podium and pointing to the delegates.
``We will work with the Republicans to try to find consensus and
bring all Americans along together. Hear me: When we win the House,
back we will replace `my way or the highway' with `our way
together.'''
</P>
<P>
   He was interrupted by chants of ``Take back the House,'' as
supporters waved placards saying ``Speaker Gephardt.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt accused the Republican House leadership of being
``one-sided, intolerant of other views _ unbending to compromise
and consensus.'' He said that over the last six years House
Republican and Democratic leaders have ``met maybe once a year'' to
discuss key issues. Of the GOP leaders, he said, ``They don't
communicate. They dictate. Democracy deserves better''
</P>
<P>
   Although he didn't mention any names, Gephardt' clearly aimed
his stinging reference at Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker
from Georgia who Democrats said was autocratic and who resigned
after Republicans suffered bruising losses in the 1998 election.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt has also feuded with House Majority Leader Richard K.
Armey and Majority Whip Tom DeLay, both of Texas, and he charged
that the Republican leadership is unwilling to approve a patients'
bill of rights, gun safety measures, a Medicare prescription drugs
benefit, President Clinton's plan to reduce class size in schools
and an overhaul of campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt's charges of Republican incivility and failure to
consult with Democrats were reminiscent of GOP charges eight years
ago that Democrats, who had controlled the House for the previous
40 years, were arrogant and failed to consult them. In fact,
Gephardt alluded to those charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were in the majorithy, we made some errors,'' he said.
``But we have learned from the past _ learned that while we have
strong beliefs we aren't always right, we do not have the answer to
every problem.''
</P>
<P>
   He urged his national audience not to believe ``that our
political well is is too poisoned, the partisan rift, too great.''
</P>
<P>
   Altough Gephardt has differed over the years with Gore,
particularly on the issue of expanded trade, he noted during his
speech Wednesday that he and his wife Jane have been friends with
Al and Tipper Gore for nearly 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is a good man,'' Gephardt said. ``He is a decent,
caring man. He listens to his heart and his head. He loves his
family. He loves this country. He could be the best president this
country will ever have.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Gephardt were elected to Congress in 1976, and in
1988 they were bitter rivals in unsuccessful campaigns for their
party's presidential nomination. In March of this year, Gephardt
bowed out of the 2000 presidential race and endorsed Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said in his speech that Gore ``knows that making the
right decisions requires more than a president. It requires a
majority in Congress to help make the right decisions for America's
families.''
</P>
<P>
   Gepardt, 59, was on Gore's short list of six possible vice
presidential choices last month, but he repeatedly said he
preferred to focus on winning back the House for Democrats, which
would ensure his selection as speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats thought Gephardt would be an attractive running
mate for Gore because the congressman hails from Missouri, a
crucial swing state and is viewed as a champion for working
families in a year when both parties are focused on helping
families. Gephardt, one of labor's staunchest allies in Congress,
also would have solidified Gore's backing from unions.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics thought centrist Democrats as well as
independents might view Gephardt as too liberal.

NORTHRIDGE SEEKING PRIMARY SECONDARY PLAYERS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cal State Northridge secondary coach Junior
Thurman doesn't have a depth chart. He doesn't want one, either.
Not until after Saturday's scrimmage, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   You can hardly blame him.
</P>
<P>
   The first-year CSUN assistant has no returning starters. Bryson
Atkins suffered a season-ending knee injury over the summer, and
Hassan Abdul-Malik, who played in the spring, transferred to Valley
College.
</P>
<P>
   Thurman still is teaching coverages to the newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're keeping it pretty simple,'' Thurman said. ``(Wednesday)
morning we just put in our fourth coverage. We're taking it slow
because we want to see them play football. We don't want them
thinking too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Karalus Doyle and Cory Oggs have played for the Matadors. Shawn
Watson participated in spring practice, and Sean Atkins transferred
from Sacramento State. Rookie Steve Paysinger and junior college
transfer Martin Bacon are vying for playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mainly with the new guys, there's a lot of learning,'' said
Thurman, whose brother, Dennis, is USC's secondary coach. ``We have
to cut down on the mental mistakes. Everybody has the physical
ability or they wouldn't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Auburn on CSUN's mind: CSUN is in the process of finding a
Division I-A school to play next season. Auburn is interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one guy (athletic director David Housel) that's called
back so far is Auburn,'' Kearin said. ``We're trying to find that
Division I-A game that's vital to our program's budget. ... The
games are great for our program. You get great exposure for the
school and it's a great experience for the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryerson injured: Backup quarterback Mitch Ryerson didn't
practice Tuesday or Wednesday because of a strained calf muscle.
Ryerson said he expects to practice today - the team's first day in
full pads.

YEARS AFTER DEATH, ELVIS NOW TAKING CARE OF E-BUSINESS

<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ Live on the Net, it's dead Elvis.
<P>
   As the 23rd anniversary of Elvis Presley's death was
commemorated Wednesday by thousands of visitors to Graceland in
Memphis, Tenn., thousands more made a cyber-pilgrimage to the
King's final resting place via the first live Webcast of the annual
candlelight vigil.
</P>
<P>
   The Webcast was just one manifestation of Elvis on the Internet.
A search of the Web turned up more than 700,000 listings for
Elvis-related sites (although some, admittedly, were more concerned
with rock star Elvis Costello and ice skater Elvis Stojko.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no one else like Elvis,'' said John Butler of
Weehawken, N.J., whose site, Johnny's Elvis Presley Salute,
attracts about 1,000 visitors a month. ``He was one of a kind.''
</P>
<P>
   The people at Elvis Presley Enterprises, which controls Elvis'
estate and commercial legacy, have done their best to remain at the
forefront of online Elvis endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the company redesigned its official Elvis Presley
site at  &LR; www.elvis-presley.com  &LR; to include virtual tours of
Graceland and voluminous offerings of Elvis info and souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   The redesign was effected just in time for Elvis Week, which
rolls around each year at this time to commemorate the 1977 heart
attack of the then-elephantine man in the blue suede shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all exhausted here,'' said Todd Morgan, a spokesman for
Elvis Presley Enterprises. ``We're going to finish up Elvis Week
and then we're all going home and collapsing.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to broadcast this year's candlelight vigil live on
the Web, he said, came as part of efforts to improve Elvis' online
presence.
</P>
<P>
   Elvis, needless to say, would have loved the Net. Or so Morgan
insisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elvis embraced all new gadgets and technologies,'' he said.
``He had home video before anyone else. He had big-screen TVs. The
Internet would definitely have interested him.''
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps frustrated him a little as well. Those who watched
the live Webcast on Tuesday night generally saw little more than a
dark blur punctuated by a few flashes of light.
</P>
<P>
   Nighttime candlelight vigils, it's safe to conclude, do not lend
themselves well to postage-stamp-size video streams.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Sherry Yeaman, a spokeswoman for Santa Clara's Yahoo,
which provided the technology for the Webcast, said about &LR;   &LR; 10,000
Elvis fans tuned in via the Net to pay their respects to the King.
</P>
<P>
   Just to keep some perspective here, about 2 million people tuned
in for the most recent Victoria's Secret online lingerie fashion
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still,'' Yeaman said, ``10,000 is pretty good. We have college
basketball games that might get 50,000. But 10,000 is pretty good
for niche content.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Jaffe of Grass Valley (Nevada County), whose site, Elvis
Presley Online, attracts as many as 3,000 visitors a day, believes
Elvis would have been thrilled by the idea that fans could download
his songs over the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved to have his music out there in the world,'' Jaffe
said. ``He was a pretty generous spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, were he still around, Elvis would be similarly pleased
(and more than a little flattered) to see that a search of eBay for
Elvis stuff turned up more than 8,000 items being auctioned.
</P>
<P>
   Mementos of the King's too-brief tenure included an Elvis
Presley Rock &AMP; Roll Thermometer (``Exceeds the quality standards of
any metal thermometer on the market today'') and a set of five
Elvis matchbooks (``If you love Elvis, you gotta have these'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight thousand is a fairly good listing,'' said Kevin
Pursglove, an eBay spokesman in San Jose. ``It's one of our
most-active categories.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there are nearly as many Elvis items listed as there
are Beanie Babies (9,000) and way more than the number of Pez
dispensers (2,500).
</P>
<P>
   Pursglove said the amount of Elvis goodies for sale on eBay
spikes every year at this time as the faithful gather, both
physically and via the Net, to remember their fallen leader.
</P>
<P>
   And while eBay has seen its share of body parts and other
unsavory offerings, Pursglove said no one has dared blaspheme the
King's memory by offering, say, Elvis' kidney.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can offer your own kidney,'' he said, ``but don't mess
with the King.''

Republican and Democratic leaders have ``met maybe once a year'' to
discuss key issues. Of the GOP leaders, he said, ``They don't
communicate. They dictate. Democracy deserves better''
</P>
<P>
   Although he didn't mention any names, Gephardt' clearly aimed
his stinging reference at Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker
from Georgia who Democrats said was autocratic and who resigned
after Republicans suffered bruising losses in the 1998 election.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt has also feuded with House Majority Leader Richard K.
Armey and Majority Whip Tom DeLay, both of Texas, and he charged
that the Republican leadership is unwilling to approve a patients'
bill of rights, gun safety measures, a Medicare prescription drugs
benefit, President Clinton's plan to reduce class size in schools
and an overhaul of campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt's charges of Republican incivility and failure to
consult with Democrats were reminiscent of GOP charges eight years
ago that Democrats, who had controlled the House for the previous
40 years, were arrogant and failed to consult them. In fact,
Gephardt alluded to those charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were in the majorithy, we made some errors,'' he said.
``But we have learned from the past _ learned that while we have
strong beliefs we aren't always right, we do not have the answer to
every problem.''
</P>
<P>
   He urged his national audience not to believe ``that our
political well is is too poisoned, the partisan rift, too great.''
</P>
<P>
   Altough Gephardt has differed over the years with Gore,
particularly on the issue of expanded trade, he noted during his
speech Wednesday that he and his wife Jane have been friends with
Al and Tipper Gore for nearly 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is a good man,'' Gephardt said. ``He is a decent,
caring man. He listens to his heart and his head. He loves his
family. He loves this country. He could be the best president this
country will ever have.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Gephardt were elected to Congress in 1976, and in
1988 they were bitter rivals in unsuccessful campaigns for their
party's presidential nomination. In March of this year, Gephardt
bowed out of the 2000 presidential race and endorsed Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said in his speech that Gore ``knows that making the
right decisions requires more than a president. It requires a
majority in Congress to help make the right decisions for America's
families.''
</P>
<P>
   Gepardt, 59, was on Gore's short list of six possible vice
presidential choices last month, but he repeatedly said he
preferred to focus on winning back the House for Democrats, which
would ensure his selection as speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats thought Gephardt would be an attractive running
mate for Gore because the congressman hails from Missouri, a
crucial swing state and is viewed as a champion for working
families in a year when both parties are focused on helping
families. Gephardt, one of labor's staunchest allies in Congress,
also would have solidified Gore's backing from unions.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics thought centrist Democrats as well as
independents might view Gephardt as too liberal.

CHOREOGRAPHED VISITS CONTINUE FOR FAMILIES DIVIDED BY NORTH AND
SOUTH

<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ On their first full day in South Korea
after half a century of separation from their families, 100 North
Koreans stepped into the bowels of capitalistic excess Wednesday _
a giant shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by a marching band playing a rousing rendition of ``Our
Hope Is Unification,'' an emotional song well known by both North
and South Koreans, the visitors walked under a five-story clock
encrusted with stained glass and through the stainless steel gates
of Lotte World in southern Seoul. A 29-acre mall, it has a 533-room
hotel, an amusement park, three shopping centers, an indoor golf
course and one of Asia's largest duty free shops.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the North Koreans were allowed to stop and shop at any
of the glitzy stores. Once off the bus, the group was whisked up
three flights of stairs into a dimly lit folk museum that features
miniature exhibits of scenes from 5,000 years of Korean history,
with the notable exception of the war that split the country in
two.
</P>
<P>
   Spying the visitors as they filed by, Jeon Ok-im, a clerk at a
women's clothing store, ran out into the main corridor to see them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been great if they could've come to see the
stores,'' Jeon said. ``But I guess they wouldn't have been able to
control them. The atmosphere would have been too free.''
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans trekking through Lotte World Wednesday morning
were half of the group that flew to South Korea on Tuesday to be
reunited with the families they lost during the war 50 years ago.
The reunions are intended as the first step down the long road
toward reunification of the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The other half of the group remained at their hotel, meeting
privately with South Korean family members. In the afternoon, the
two groups traded itineraries in yet another example of the bizarre
orchestration that marks what under normal circumstances would be a
series of intimate, intensely private family affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But the ground rules agreed upon by the two governments, rising
out of five decades of hostility and mistrust between the two
countries, make normality impossible. The North Koreans are staying
in a hotel on one side of the Han River, while their southern
relatives stay in a hotel on the opposite shore.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, their first meeting was a mass gathering in a
cavernous convention hall, bristling with boom microphones and
crawling with reporters and photographers.
</P>
<P>
   And on Wednesday, the North Korean visitors were hustled onto
buses and ferried to Lotte World, when they might have preferred to
spend the entire day with their families.
</P>
<P>
   In North Korea, 100 South Koreans visiting relatives there were
being subjected to a similarly rigid routine.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   South Korean officials chose Lotte World as the site for the
day's tour because of its proximity to the hotel where the North
Koreans are staying _ not to give them a lesson in free market
economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The schedule is very tight, and they have to move around in
groups,'' said the Unification Ministry spokesman, Kim Hyoun Du.
``If they were to go out further, the round trip could run up to
four or five hours.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that North Korean government officials, who visited
Seoul earlier this year, went on the same tour, which gave South
Korean officials experience and lessened the logistical
difficulties of the outing.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the noisy symbol of a free-market economy that
greeted them, the North Korean visitors were markedly reserved in
their comments and expressions, visibly mindful of the North Korean
officials who were their ever-present escorts, often holding their
hands as they walked along.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the minders nor the reunion's South Korean organizers,
however, anticipated Oh Soon-kyun, 52, and her daughter. Holding a
large piece of paper with the name of their North Korean family
member, they showed up at Lotte World determined to greet Kim Gyu
Sol, 66, one of the North Korean visitors and the brother of Oh's
husband.
</P>
<P>
   For logistical reasons, the South Korean government allowed only
five South Korean family members to meet with each North Korean
visitor, and Oh and her daughter had been excluded
</P>
<P>
   For a brief moment, Oh and Kim Gyu Sol embraced. With tears
glazing their faces, they whispered a few words to each other. But
Kim Gyu Sol pulled away, saying ``I have to go now,'' and rejoined
the tour group.
</P>
<P>
   (Mrs. Oh and her daughter were not the only people to try this
means of glimpsing long-lost relatives. At least one similar
incident occurred, during the afternoon mall visit.)
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Inside the folk museum, Kim Gyu Sol and the other North Koreans
began a miniature journey through the history of their nation,
starting with scenes of stone-age ancestors hunting for food. It
was impossible to know whether the models brought to mind the food
shortages in their own country; both the North Korean visitors and
their South Korean counterparts had been warned not to discuss
matters relating to living conditions in North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans moved from exhibit to exhibit, their faces
fixed in polite expressions that showed little evidence of awe or
envy toward the palaces of wealth and intricate historical tributes
that their Southern counterparts had built over the decades since
the end of the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already seen things like this before,'' said Moon Yang
Ok, 67, who came to visit her younger sister in Seoul. ``We have
these exhibits, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Ri Rok Won, 59, said the exhibits reminded him of his days as a
child in the South. ``I saw the real thing on a school trip a long
time ago,'' Ri said.
</P>
<P>
   But pressed to give his impression of Seoul, he glanced at his
North Korean escort and tapped on his ear. ``His hearing is not
good,'' his escort said.
</P>
<P>
   Ri Don, 82, was more candid. He said the 20-minute bus ride from
the hotel to the shopping mall was a bit nerve racking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad we didn't get in a car accident,'' he said. ``There
are so many cars!''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the warm smiles and welcomes from the people on
the streets made up for the congested streets.
</P>
<P>
   Pak Sang Op, 68, said the Seoul he remembered from 50 years ago
seemed to have deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Han River is the same, but it became a lot murkier,'' he
said. ``The city is just too crowded and doesn't have the freshness
it used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Jo Jyu Gyong, 68, felt differently. ``I'd like to go back to my
old campus someday,'' he mused. Now a celebrated academic in North
Korea, accorded the status of People's Scientist by the founder of
North Korea, Kim Il Sung, Jo graduated from the prestigious Seoul
National University.
</P>
<P>
   He said his mother had put him through university by peddling
goods. But during the war, Jo volunteered to serve in the North
Korean army and, like so many of the visitors on this trip, never
returned home.
</P>
<P>
   The tour ended with models of open-air markets and royal palaces
in the 18th century, and then the visitors watched a short
multimedia presentation of a major Korean naval battle in the late
1500s, which saw the defeat of Japanese invaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We share the same history,'' Pak mused. ``Unification will
lead to more glorious progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans seem more convinced of the potential for
reunification than their Southern compatriots. Lee Jin-kyu, a
retired office worker sitting outside the mall and watching the
hubbub around the North Koreans, was somewhat skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the North Koreans seem to be saying, `Great Leader
this' and `Great Leader that,''' Lee said. ``I sincerely hope that
the two Koreas will soon become one. But it will be difficult if
they keep on saying things like that.''

BEST BUY EXEC NAMED CEO AT GOOD GUYS  &HT;     BY CAROL EMERT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ Good Guys Inc. poached a top executive from rival
Best Buy Co. to help fix the troubled electronics chain and one day
take its helm.
<P>
   Kenneth Weller, who began his retailing career as a Good Guys
store clerk in 1982, was named president of the Brisbane
electronics company Wednesday. He is the heir apparent to Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Ronald Unkefer.
</P>
<P>
   The move was ironic because Weller, by all accounts a popular
and charismatic sales executive, recruited a slew of valuable Good
Guys employees after moving to Best Buy in 1993, where he opened
stores in direct competition with Good Guys.
</P>
<P>
   The crossover is particularly interesting in light of widespread
rumors that Good Guys had been in talks in recent months about
being acquired by Best Buy, which is headquartered in Eden Prairie,
Minn.
</P>
<P>
   Best Buy, which runs eight stores in the Bay Area and 365 across
the United States, refused to comment on either Weller's move or
the rumored acquisition talks.
</P>
<P>
   Unkefer said Good Guys, which operates 79 high-end stores in
California, Washington, Oregon and Nevada, is not involved in
merger discussions. Asked whether such conversations had taken
place recently, he said, ``I can't say. I don't want to comment at
all about those kinds of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Best Buy considered running Good Guys as a
secondary chain targeting upscale consumers and technophiles. The
talks ceased after an agreement could not be reached, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Unkefer did confirm that Good Guys is negotiating to move its
high-profile Brisbane headquarters on San Francisco Bay to a
cheaper site in Hayward.
</P>
<P>
   Good Guys reportedly will receive a multimillion-dollar buyout
of its Brisbane lease. Due to a staff downsizing, it is already
subletting three floors of the five it leases in an office building
visible from Highway 101.
</P>
<P>
   Unkefer would not discuss the lease terms, saying no deal is
final. But Good Guys' quarterly report, filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission on Monday, says the company may break even
this year instead of posting a loss in part because of ``earnings
that could be achieved from leased real estate transactions being
negotiated.''
</P>
<P>
   Weller, who starts September 1, rejoins Good Guys at a crucial
juncture. The company has posted a net loss in each of the past
four fiscal years and, despite earlier projections for profits this
year, will either break even or see a small loss in fiscal 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Unkefer, who founded the chain as a San Francisco stereo shop in
1973, returned last summer after a several-year hiatus to try to
turn the business around. But all did not go according to plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came in last July, I thought I could fix everything in
90 days and be a superhero,'' Unkefer said in a telephone interview
Wednesday ``My timing was a little off.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Unkefer noted, ``We lost $40 million last year, so
we've made $40 million in progress'' by reaching close to
break-even in 2000. ``If we could do half as well next year, I
would be a hero,'' Unkefer said.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Gordon, an analyst with Banc of America Securities in San
Francisco, sees clear signs of a turnaround at Good Guys.
</P>
<P>
   Losses are narrowing and sales in some key categories, such as
televisions, digital cameras and digital video disc players, are
improving. In categories excluding computers and home office
equipment, which Unkefer discontinued last year, sales rose a
healthy 4 percent in the quarter ending June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Good Guys has also begun renting excess space in two stores to
Tower Records and is looking for other tenants, which should help
improve its store productivity, Gordon noted.
</P>
<P>
   But the top priority at Good Guys is improving its sales force.
</P>
<P>
   Unkefer has made some changes, such as reorganizing the sales
staff and laying off less knowledgeable workers. Weller said he
wants to ramp up their knowledge of products and infuse them with
enthusiasm that will translate into better customer service and
higher retention rates.
</P>
<P>
   Current and former Good Guys executives described Weller in
Moseslike terms. ``He is a leader of people, the best I ever worked
with,'' Unkefer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a tremendous motivator, a tremendous teacher,'' said
Robert Gunst, who served as Good Guys CEO from 1993 until last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Unkefer, who worked closely with Weller for 10 years during the
'80s and '90s, asked Weller to rejoin Good Guys even before Unkefer
had officially resumed the CEO role last year.
</P>
<P>
   But Weller was hesitant to make the jump, in part because he was
not sure that Good Guys would pull through, and in part because he
was waiting for millions of dollars of Best Buy stock options to
vest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were waiting for the stars to line up,'' said Weller, who
still has many allies at Good Guys from his earlier stint there.
</P>
<P>
   Weller joined Good Guys in 1982 as a store clerk in Concord. He
had just moved to the United States from his native Great Britain
as his first career as an amateur horse-racing jockey was coming to
an end.
</P>
<P>
   Weller said he moved to California in pursuit of a love interest
and planned to stay for only two years. But in 1986, he was
promoted to vice president of sales and is credited with helping
Good Guys grow from 11 stores to 45 during his seven years in that
role.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Weller moved to Best Buy and became a senior vice
president for sales, opening 60 stores in seven years throughout
the West and the South. He will join the Good Guys board in
addition to assuming the president's mantle.

AT&AMP;T OVERHAUL PLAN MAY BE DECIDED UPON IN SEPTEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Exclusive) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With its stock price down, AT&AMP;T will probably decide on a
significant restructuring in September, possibly including a
leveraged buyout, led by John C. Malone, of the company's consumer
long-distance telephone business, people close to AT&AMP;T said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The company is considering a broad range of potential moves
meant to emphasize its strengths. Those options may increase over
the next few weeks: the people close to the company said that
AT&AMP;T's investment bankers were hard at work developing new
strategies. A person close to AT&AMP;T's senior leadership said that at
least a preliminary decision would probably be reached at the next
board meeting, scheduled for the third week of September.
</P>
<P>
   However, a person close to the discussions said it was unlikely
that an announcement would be made shortly after that meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a potential buyout of the consumer unit, other
options include issuing new shares meant to track the consumer
unit, issuing shares meant to track AT&AMP;T's cable television
operations, and simply selling one or both of those units to other
publicly traded companies.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, AT&AMP;T might choose to do nothing. Support on the board
for C. Michael Armstrong, the chairman, is strong. But at the
moment, many analysts believe that he cannot survive next year
unless the company is revamped or the prospects for AT&AMP;T as
currently structured somehow brighten significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the view has been bleak. AT&AMP;T's shares have lost
almost 37 percent of their value this year _ closing Wednesday on
the New York Stock Exchange at $32.125, up $1, and not much above
the 52-week low of $29.625 touched on Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   The sell-off has come as the company's core consumer
long-distance business shrank more quickly than most analysts
expected and the once-robust unit serving business customers has
also stumbled. At the same time, AT&AMP;T's move to become the nation's
No. 1 cable television provider has not yet been as successful as
many investors had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   So now, with a market value around $121 billion, AT&AMP;T is worth
only somewhat more than the $96 billion it paid to acquire the
cable giants Tele-Communications Inc. and the MediaOne Group.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the individual value of each of AT&AMP;T's operations,
including the consumer and business services units, as well as the
wireless holdings, AT&AMP;T's top executives and board members believe
that the company is worth $225 billion to $300 billion, a person
close to the company said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The most vocal proponent for change has perhaps been Malone, the
former chairman of TCI and an AT&AMP;T board member. Malone, whose
stake in AT&AMP;T has declined in value by $1 billion during the
stock's slide, has said that AT&AMP;T is trying to do too many things
at once.
</P>
<P>
   A person close to Liberty Media, Malone's television programming
operation, said Wednesday that he was not seriously entertaining
the idea of trying to acquire all of AT&AMP;T. For one thing, Liberty
Media, which trades as an AT&AMP;T tracking stock, cannot issue
additional shares without AT&AMP;T's approval, according to a person
close to AT&AMP;T. And even if Liberty Media is spun off, a takeover of
the parent company is not in Malone's current plans, said the
person close to Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   But Malone could still play a major role in a remaking of AT&AMP;T,
and not just as a board member.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more intriguing options on the table is for a
Malone-led leveraged buyout of the consumer long-distance
operations. That business, which made AT&AMP;T the giant it is today,
is now shrinking amid ruthless price wars and the entry of huge
regional Bell companies into the long-distance arena.
</P>
<P>
   Still, long-distance service generates rafts of cash. This year,
the unit will probably produce about $8 billion in cash flow _ or
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, on
perhaps $20 billion of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   In any potential sale, a Wall Street analyst said Wednesday that
the consumer unit would probably not fetch more than twice those
earnings, or $16 billion. And, in any case, the unit's cash flow
could easily support a significant debt load. Malone, known as a
financial wizard, would almost surely be able to put together the
necessary financing, if he so chose.
</P>
<P>
   A person close to AT&AMP;T's continuing deliberations cautioned,
however, that for now the leveraged-buyout option did not appear
any more likely than any of the others under consideration.

UNITED TESTS NEW SYSTEM TO SEND FLIGHT DELAY ALERTS  &HT;     BY VERNE KOPYTOFF
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ United Airlines passengers could get some relief
soon from flight delays and cancellations.
<P>
   The company is testing a service that sends messages with
updated flight information to passengers via their cellular and
home telephones, electronic organizers, personal computers and fax
machines.
</P>
<P>
   The tests come as United Airlines is beset with flight delays
and cancellations because of labor troubles, bad weather and
crowded skies.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  However, Dan Black, director of e-commerce for United, said
his company first considered the messaging service before its
latest troubles began this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The technology, created by Centerpost, a Chicago company, will
allow United to communicate with customers by e-mail or automated
telephone calls. The program presumably would be more convenient
for customers because they would no longer have to call about
flight schedule changes or fear being far from a telephone just
before their flight is scheduled to take off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps customers control their time,'' Black said. ``If they
know about their flight being delayed or canceled, customers can
better manage their time.''
</P>
<P>
   The United test is expected to begin in 35 to 40 days and will
include several thousand passengers, Black said. The service will
be free during the trials but it is unclear whether travelers will
have to pay a fee if United adopts the technology for its
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  To use the service, travelers must sign up at a Web site and
choose how to receive their messages. Juergen Stark, chief
executive of Centerpost, said travelers can, for example, choose to
get urgent messages about flight delays on their cellular
telephones and less-pressing ones such as fare sales and
frequent-flier postings on their e-mail accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Many airlines already use e-mail and faxes to a limited extent
with travelers to send confirmation codes and notices about fare
sales. United implemented a program in December to e-mail
passengers who register online about delays and cancellations in
their flights.
</P>
<P>
   Centerpost's program could be the most-comprehensive use of
automated messaging by an airline, according to Eric Arnum, editor
of Messaging Online, a daily newsletter that tracks the messaging
industry.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  He said United may be able to save money with the program by
hiring fewer people to call passengers when their flights are
canceled. It could be particularly useful, he said, for business
travelers who are difficult to reach when away from home.

LAST CASH 60 MILES: BOFA'S EXIT LEAVES TOWN IN THE LURCH, WITHOUT 
 BANK  
 BY SAM ZUCKERMAN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR; Bridgeport, Calif. _ This little town on the eastern slope of
the Sierra Nevada, set in one of the wildest and most beautiful
places in California, is about to experience something scarcely
imaginable to the average urbanite _ life without a bank.
<P>
   At the end of September, Bank of America will close its
Bridgeport branch, the only banking office in this tourist town of
700 people. Unless another institution moves in at the last minute,
local residents with banking business will have to travel more than
120 miles round trip south to Mammoth Lakes or north to
Gardnerville, Nev., over a highway that can be treacherous in the
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, local merchants say, a stop at the bank to deposit
cash and lay in a supply of change is a routine errand, a chore
many of them do every day. When BofA pulls out of Bridgeport, that
task will become a time-consuming and potentially dangerous ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Mills, proprietor of Hays Street Cafe, a restaurant on
Highway 395 at the south end of town, said he will go to
Gardnerville to bank, taking him away from his business for three
or four hours, a disruption he says he can't afford.
</P>
<P>
   ``A typical trip for me now is five minutes,'' Mills said of his
daily 100-yard walk to BofA. When the bank is gone, ``I can't
imagine doing the trip more than once a week. I don't like the
mileage and the cost of fuel. And I'll have to hire someone else
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, law enforcement officials say they worry that local
residents will hoard thousands of dollars between trips to the
bank, leaving them vulnerable to robbers in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some serious concerns about the amount of cash people
will have on hand and will have to take long distances,'' said Mono
County Sheriff Daniel Paranick. He said his office has already
received several applications for concealed-weapon permits from
anxious residents.
</P>
<P>
   In this age of megamergers and Internet banking, the
disappearance of a single bank branch is hardly unusual. To save
money, big banks have closed thousands of branches across the
country while they channel customers to cheaper alternatives such
as ATMs or stripped-down offices in supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to look at any of the big banks, everybody has a
hot list of branches to close,'' said Gordon Goetzmann, a retail
banking specialist at First Manhattan Consulting Group.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases though, when a branch shuts, there is another bank
nearby. What's unique about Bridgeport is that BofA's office is the
only banking facility for 60 miles. Its loss will create hardship
for local residents that can't be compared with the inconvenience
caused by the shuttering of a city or suburban branch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it hard to believe that a community can be left
bankless,'' said Valerie Roy, a former regulatory compliance
officer with Boston's BayBank, now a banking specialist with
TowerGroup, a Massachusetts consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport isn't the only small California town that has faced
the loss of its bank. During the 1990s, communities such as Julian
(San Diego County) and Pescadero lost their only banks.
</P>
<P>
   But neither Pescadero nor Julian was as isolated as Bridgeport.
Pescadero residents, for example, would have had to drive 13 miles
to Half Moon Bay to bank. And both communities persuaded
independent banks to move in to fill the vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   Although BofA officials regret the problems Bridgeport is
facing, they say they can't justify keeping a money-losing facility
open. With just $7.5 million in deposits, about one-10th the size
of a typical urban office, BofA's branch is simply too tiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at our entire retail delivery network and clearly
Bridgeport was on the bottom,'' said Larry Knutson, the Bakersfield
executive who runs BofA's branch network in the Sierra region. ``We
couldn't make money at $7.5 million in deposits and, in this day
and age, the investors want you to make money.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport seems like another world from the metropolitan sprawl
of San Francisco and Los Angeles. ``This is really the last
frontier of California,'' said Paranick, the county sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   The town lies at 6,500 feet, in a vast place of big skies,
rolling rangeland and soaring peaks, where sagebrush ends and pine
trees begin. Although Mono is one of the California's biggest
counties in land area, only 11,000 people live here and they seem
to be outnumbered by the cattle grazing in the mountain shadows.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, the trip to Bridgeport from the Bay Area
takes only five hours over the Sierra through Sonora Pass. When
snow closes the road in winter, the only access to town is Highway
395, the main route between Los Angeles and Reno.
</P>
<P>
   The highway brings thousands of tourists from April to
September, most of them from Southern California, looking to do a
little fishing _ the state-record brown trout was caught here _ or
hang out with the family in a cabin by a mountain lake. The
visitors drop millions of dollars of cash in Bridgeport's bars,
restaurants, gas stations, motels, resorts and trinket shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are mostly blue-collar people,'' said Jim Reid, owner of
Ken's Sporting Goods store in town. ``They don't have a whole lot
of credit cards. They're just regular folks.''
</P>
<P>
   BofA opened its Bridgeport office in 1960, the first bank in the
county since the early 1930s. Mono was the only county in the state
without a BofA branch back then.
</P>
<P>
   The new 2,000-square-foot office, built from the ground up in
the angled-roof ranch house style popular at the time, achieved the
bank's ``long cherished dream to have a branch in every county of
the state,'' according to a local press report at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In flyers distributed to local residents, BofA pridefully noted
that the office featured ``modern design, windowless teller
service, the newest in streamlined banking'' and was ``completely
air conditioned.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, as big city banking grew impersonal,
Bridgeport's BofA branch remained a throwback to the vision of
founder A.P. Giannini, who built an empire doing business with
little people. The bank extended credit to business owners at the
beginning of tourist season and took in their receipts as visitors
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had all the business in town. You got to know all your
customers well,'' recalled Joyce Meade, who recently retired after
working 51 years for BofA, including 15 years as Bridgeport branch
manager.
</P>
<P>
   But, to BofA's top executives, Bridgeport was a nuisance. By the
early 1990s, the bank had decided to sell the Bridgeport branch to
another financial institution. No takers could be found.
</P>
<P>
   About four years ago, the bank tried again, including Bridgeport
in a package of some two dozen branches put up for sale in small
towns across the state. BofA says the Bridgeport office was the
only one it couldn't unload.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the bank kept scaling back its Bridgeport operation.
By 2000, the branch employed just three people and operated only
five hours a day, except on Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   Folks in Bridgeport found out in June that BofA was planning to
leave. County administrator John Wohlmuth said bank officials
notified him of their plan during a routine meeting about the
county government's banking business.
</P>
<P>
   Bank customers received form letters at the end of June, right
on the 90-day notification deadline required by law, telling them
the bank was ``consolidating'' their accounts at the Mammoth Lakes
branch.
</P>
<P>
   Residents were stunned by the news. Several began organizing
immediately, writing letters of protest to BofA officials and
printing flyers.
</P>
<P>
   In press releases and letters to local residents, BofA explained
that the Bridgeport branch wasn't doing enough business to stay
open. That didn't impress folks in Bridgeport, who point out that
the bank makes $2 billion in profit every quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the headquarters had moved to North Carolina,'' said
Kellie Annett, co-owner of Mono Village, a resort 14 miles outside
of town, referring to the 1998 takeover of San Francisco's BofA by
NationsBank. ``But I didn't believe they had become so big and
uncaring.''
</P>
<P>
   BofA's Knutson said the bank has gone out of its way to
accommodate its Bridgeport customers. For example, the bank will
offer daily courier service for noncash items. And bank officials
point out that several private ATMs will remain in town to dispense
cash, though they won't be able to accept deposits.
</P>
<P>
   BofA won't budge on its September 29 closure deadline and won't
transport cash for customers, Knutson said.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport folks now say their best hope is to bring another
bank or thrift into town. And several area bankers say they are
weighing the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the information we have so far, which is limited, we
do have an interest,'' said Ron Martin, chief executive of Oak
Valley Community Bank based in the San Joaquin Valley town of
Oakdale.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the obstacles are daunting. The deposit size of the BofA
branch is about half the minimum needed to make a go of the
business, said Thomas Meuser, chief executive of El Dorado Savings
Bank, a Placerville thrift that several years ago bought BofA's
branch down the road from Bridgeport in Lone Pine.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the roughly $800 cost of an armored car trip to
Bridgeport could be prohibitive for any potential buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Martin, chief executive of Nevada State Bank, said his
institution is trying to determine the feasibility of putting in
some kind of merchant automated teller system that could accept
cash deposits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people in Gardnerville really want something to work out
in the worst way,'' he noted. ``But we are not making any
promises.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Tuesday evening might have looked like Kennedy
Central at the Democratic convention, but the family member who is
the biggest star inside the party these days was not on the podium
in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick J. Kennedy, 33, the second-term congressman from Rhode
Island, has achieved stardom in the behind-the-scenes world of
money and politics, collecting millions of dollars for his House
colleagues and Democratic congressional candidates. In his role as
chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee,
Kennedy has impressed his older and more seasoned colleagues,
including Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the House minority leader, who
is also a committee leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the brightest and hardest working young fund-raiser to
hit the Democratic Party since Tony Coelho,'' said Mark Weiner, the
treasurer of the Democratic Governors' Association and a big-league
Democratic money man himself.
</P>
<P>
   Under Kennedy's stewardship, the D Triple-C, as the committee is
called in political shorthand, has collected $62 million since
January 1999, Erik Smith, the committee spokesman, said. With the
fierce struggle for control of the House in the November election,
this record haul is a potent weapon for Democrats. House Democrats
actually have more cash on hand than their Republican counterparts,
a historic reversal.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, hopeful congressional candidates and his
grateful colleagues from the House celebrated Kennedy's
transformation into a Democratic money machine at a party for 1,500
people at the Egyptian Theater, a lavishly restored movie palace on
Hollywood Boulevard that first opened in 1922 with Douglas
Fairbanks in ``Robin Hood.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is, in a way, a Robin Hood for the Democrats. At
Kennedy's urging, individual donors are giving more money to his
committee than ever before. Since his appointment in December 1998,
Kennedy has initiated tiered giving, starting elite groups for
Democratic donors of $50,000 and $100,000. Kennedy has been on the
road almost constantly, raising money for Democratic House races,
including trips to San Diego, Seattle and Atlanta. He even
persuaded Tony Bennett, whose private performances can cost as much
as $250,000, to donate a concert next weekend in Newport, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   That is proof, committee staff members say, that Kennedy has a
lot of celebrity power at work. ``Patrick can call up a CEO and ask
for money,'' a staff member said. ``The name helps. Patrick gets
his calls returned.''
</P>
<P>
   Such bluntness is not out of character for Kennedy, who is a
bold speaker, given to occasional outbursts complete with
foot-stamping and a high-pitched strain to his voice that makes him
sound more like a croaky teen-ager and less of a congressional
heavy.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he spoke passionately to delegations in a series of
breakfast meetings: about the important symbolism of one uncle's
nomination here 40 years ago and another uncle's assassination here
32 years ago, as well as the spinal tumor that threatened his life
years ago. As a politician, Kennedy is energetic and displays the
hallmark Kennedy charm. As he approached the meeting of American
Indians, several older women rushed out to hug him, tears in their
eyes. It seems that everyone at the convention calls him by his
first name.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, those who would accuse Kennedy of selling
out. There are some ironies at work in Kennedy's fund-raising:
Two-thirds of the money the committee has raised was in the form of
large, unlimited contributions known as soft money, the type of
donation used for party building that Democrats are trying to
eliminate. And Kennedy's father, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts, helped draft the Federal Election Campaign Act of
1976, which was intended in part to limit soft-money donations.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell West, a professor of political science at Brown
University, who has written a biography of Patrick Kennedy, said
that Kennedy was openly flouting the rules his father wrote in 1976
to rebuild his party's finances. ``It is deeply ironic the way
Kennedy is using soft money,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's spokesman, Larry Berman, said: ``Well, the Republicans
made the rules. And Patrick just wants to play on a level playing
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is reputed to have a bit of a temper; in March, for
example, he physically confronted a 58-year-old female security
guard at Los Angeles International Airport. The Los Angeles city
attorney's office considered filing misdemeanor battery charges but
declined. Kennedy acknowledged that he had acted rudely and
apologized.
</P>
<P>
   So much fund-raising leaves him little personal time, he said.
He is not married. ``Marriage gives you the image of stability,
gravity and maturity,'' he said as he rushed out of the Omni to
more receptions and interviews. He paused for a moment, then added:
``You know, all of those important things that are missing from my
life.''

ANALYSIS: LIEBERMAN MUST DOWNPLAY PAST POLICY DIFFERENCES WITH
GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (updates by subbing 2nd graf and inserting 2 new grafs after 3rd
graf)  
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was a new-model Joseph Lieberman, hurriedly
retooled to the specifications of a national campaign, who took the
stage here Wednesday night as the presumptive Democratic vice
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   No advocacy of school vouchers or the partial privatization of
Social Security, no criticism of affirmative action. No untrimmed
edges that might keep the party's core voters from supporting Al
Gore. Nothing that might dramatize the candidates' differences
rather than their agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Al Gore for 15 years,'' Lieberman assured the
convention delegates in his speech. ``I know his record and his
heart. I know him as a public servant and I know what it is like to
sit with him around the dining room table. We have discussed _
sometimes even debated _ policy issues. And we have shared private
moments of prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   There was talk about his family, about his immigrant
grandmother, his father's bakery route, his wife's family's
survival of the Holocaust. There was a helping of Jewish schtick.
There was a bow to bipartisanship _ ``our opponents are decent and
likable men'' and ``I am proud to call many in their party my
friends'' _ but also a careful enumeration of policy differences
between the rival tickets.
</P>
<P>
   But any new proposals will have to come from Gore himself on
Thursday night. For his part, Lieberman delved even less into the
nitty-gritty than Dick Cheney, his Republican opponent, did at the
Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the world of the vice presidential candidate (and the
vice president, for that matter), where the rules are simple:
Praise your master and mute your own views.
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of his record, some people might have expected
something a bit more unconventional, from Lieberman, the
Connecticut senator, though probably unrealistically.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton was a master at reconciling differences among
Democrats of varying stripes. But as William Daley, the chairman of
the Gore campaign, noted the other day, wearing his best Buster
Keaton deadpan, ``Clinton is not on the ticket this year.'' And
Gore has trouble enough with the party's base without getting into
more because of Lieberman's views.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of Democratic skittishness on this point that
Lieberman has backtracked on several points of importance to the
constituencies that the ticket needs to re-energize. But the
rejiggering could be costly.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has a bit of a reputation for flip-flopping and
corner-cutting on issues like abortion and trade. Former Sen. Bill
Bradley, Gore's opponent during the primaries, accused him in
January of ``using words in a very tricky manner.'' Gov. George W.
Bush, the Republican nominee, mocked Gore for having voted one way
on guns in the 1980s and another in the 1990s, adding, ``When it's
convenient politically, he changes his tune.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic strategists hoped that Lieberman, who refused to
buckle when colleagues tried to dissuade him from criticizing
Clinton's sexual misconduct, would lend the ticket some
stand-by-your-guns luster. Much of that could be lost if Lieberman
seems to be bending to political expediency at this stage.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman began attacking that problem when they
visited the vice president's home town, Carthage, Tenn., almost a
week ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me,'' said Lieberman, ``when President Gore decides,
Vice President Lieberman will support him wholeheartedly.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president responded: ``I think it's a strength and not
a weakness, an asset, not a liability, to be able to have a
different point of view represented in the room at the time that
decisions are being made.''
</P>
<P>
   But that, they seem to have concluded since, was not quite
enough.
</P>
<P>
   There was a day when presidential nominees chose running-mates
who provided ideological balance. In 1952, Adlai Stevenson, a
Northern liberal, chose John Sparkman, an Alabama conservative, and
in 1976, Jimmy Carter, a Southern conservative, chose Walter F.
Mondale, a Minnesota liberal. But like so many old norms in U.S.
politics, that has gone by the board.
</P>
<P>
   This year, ideological identity is the real goal for the
Democratic ticket, much as the party may have flaunted its
ideological diversity in ``Liberals' corner'' Tuesday night. Vice
President Al Gore not only selected someone from roughly the same
segment of the party as he _ both have been stalwarts of the
centrist Democratic Leadership Conference _ but he and his aides
have sought to make sure Lieberman fell into line on all the major
issues.
</P>
<P>
   That took some doing, because on some issues, his position was a
bit to the right of Gore's. Not that Lieberman is a right-winger,
or anything resembling one. He may have had doubts about
affirmative action, for example, but he will be the first person
ever chosen for a national ticket who went to Mississippi to show
racial solidarity in the dark days of 1963.
</P>
<P>
   But take the matter of vouchers issued to parents by the federal
government, to be used to pay their children's tuition. In his time
as Connecticut's junior senator, Lieberman sponsored legislation
establishing experimental programs for vouchers. He voted for such
programs on at least four occasions. But vouchers are anathema to
the American Federation of Teachers and the 2.5 million-member
National Education Association, a pair of powerhouses that are
expected to pour money and manpower into the Gore campaign this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   What to do? After he was named by Gore, according to a report in
The Wall Street Journal, Lieberman called Sandra Feldman, the
leader of the teachers' federation, and promised that a
Gore-Lieberman administration would be resolutely anti-voucher.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Lieberman voiced support for Proposition 209 in
California, a ballot initiative that ended racial and gender
preferences in state university admissions. The same year, in a
Senate floor speech, he said ``affirmative action is dividing us in
ways its creators could not have intended,'' and added: ``If you
discriminate in favor of one group on the basis of race, you
thereby discriminate against another group on the basis of race.''
</P>
<P>
   Statements like that helped to win Lieberman a reputation as one
of the least partisan, most civil and most thoughtful members of
Congress. But not among African-Americans, one of the groups Gore
must count upon.
</P>
<P>
   So this week Lieberman visited the Congressional Black Caucus to
assuage its members' concerns. ``I have supported affirmative
action,'' he told them. ``I do support affirmative action. And I
will support affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, he has retreated from the idea of allocating some
percentage of Social Security funds for investment by individuals _
a proposal, known as partial privatization, at the heart of the
Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in 1998 with the Copley News Service, Lieberman
said, ``I think in the end that individual control of part of the
retirement-Social Security funds has to happen.'' Gore stoutly
opposes that.
</P>
<P>
   But almost immediately after he was chosen by Gore, the senator
released an unpublished op-ed article entitled, ``My Private
Journey Away from Privatization,'' written at the behest of the
Gore campaign. In it, he said that the promises and the numbers
supporting the proposal ``don't add up.''

LATE AND MESSY, BUT NOT BAD NEWS FOR THE GORE CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  By PETER MARKS and ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At first glance, things might seem not to have
gone particularly well for the organizers of Al Gore's Democratic
convention these past two days.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's speech began almost 30 minutes late on
Monday. On Tuesday night, the evening was weighted down with a
procession of speakers from the party's past, so that by the time
the keynote speaker began delivering his address, prime time was
fading, delegates were sneaking out the door and the networks were
losing interest quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The roll call Wednesday night was scheduled to end _ well, on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   All of this looks fairly bad by conventional measures of
modern-day conventions, which are heavily focused on live network
news coverage. But none of it may matter.
</P>
<P>
   There were some grumblings _ outside the Gore campaign _ among
senior Democrats on Wednesday night about the evident absence of
discipline, particularly in contrast to what was on display at the
Republican National Convention in Philadelphia two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in part because of planning _ and in part, one top
Democratic official acknowledged, because of sheer luck _ the
management of the spectacle and the media in the Democratic
convention seems to be playing, if in slightly messy ways, to the
advantage of Gore, if not necessarily to the Democratic Party at
large.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the keynote speaker did not take the stage until nearly 11
p.m., Eastern time, on Tuesday. But for days, aides to Gore have
said that the last thing they wanted voters to pay attention to
that night was what was taking place on the stage here.
</P>
<P>
   The voters' attention was supposed to have been focused on Gore
meeting Clinton in Michigan _ and Clinton leaving the stage.
</P>
<P>
   The convention, meanwhile, was used as a place to deal with the
party's obligations, generally to the left-wing of the party.
</P>
<P>
   If that drew little attention from the general public, Gore's
centrist Democratic aides said, all the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's check the box day,'' one aide said.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, Clinton talked so late that he bumped David Letterman
back a few minutes, and wiped out the lucrative East Coast news
stations.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Clinton's aides were described as frantic over the
clock as they waited for Clinton to go on to the podium, Gore's
aides were sanguine, confident that viewers would hang in for
Clinton's last pitch.
</P>
<P>
   And the ratings proved them right.
</P>
<P>
   This seeming display of disorganization by the Democratic Party
pushed Hillary Rodham Clinton's speech 20 minutes late and right
into the living rooms of millions of American television viewers,
many of whom would not have seen the speech by the first lady (and
candidate for the Senate in New York) had it gone on time.
Democratic officials insisted this was pure coincidence. Network
officials, forced to pick up the speech, were at best dubious. Mrs.
Clinton's aides were serenely silent.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party has never been known as a model of
efficiency, and Democrats have long joked that they would have
trouble arranging a two-car funeral.
</P>
<P>
   The display of Swiss precision offered by the Republicans in
Philadelphia seemed designed, in part, to highlight the sloppier
ways of the Democratic Party, and the Democrats seem at time to
have been happy to oblige the Republicans make that argument.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprising, some Democrats have sought to make inefficiency
seem a virtue. ``Look, we are more free-wheeling,'' said Edward G.
Rendell, the general chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
``Look at all the speakers that we have. I think we have 240
speakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rendell acknowledged that having Clinton speak after 11 p.m.,
Eastern time, was less than ideal. ``But I wouldn't make too much
of it,'' he said. ``And they've done much better since the first
night. And the first night they were relaxed because they had a
fail-safe because they knew the networks would not pull the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   And the fact is that while inefficiency might have served the
Democrats well these first two nights _ or at least not hurt the
party _ things began to change Wednesday evening with the first of
what Gore's aides view as the only truly meaningful nights of the
week.
</P>
<P>
   The first was Wednesday night, when Gore was nominated by his
daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, and introduced by a biographical
film, directed by Spike Jonze, all designed to add some color to
Gore's gray outlines. The second is Thursday, when Gore delivers
his acceptance speech. One of Gore's aides said flatly Wednesday
night that that would happen by 10:15 sharp. (A few minutes later,
this adviser amended his advisory: ``Or maybe a few minutes after
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In some measure, the lax organization serves neither Gore nor
his party. One of Gore's senior aides said Wednesday night that
Clinton would draw an audience no matter how late he spoke, within
reason. Another Democrat outside the campaign described it as a
``critical mistake,'' adding, ``It is unconscionable that one of
the greatest political speeches you and I have ever heard went on
until 11:40.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation was no different on Tuesday night. The only event
that Gore's aides really cared about was the speech by Caroline
Kennedy Schlossberg, an event so unusual that they assumed that
viewers would tune in and that the late news would give it abundant
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers _ some of whom admitted they had not even
bothered watching the convention _ said they were less than
distressed that speakers like Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, Jesse Jackson
and Bill Bradley might not have escaped the notice of most American
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   NBC News did not even broadcast Tuesday night, a decision that
Gore's advisers did not quarrel with. The prime-time network
television audience for the convention, though strong on Monday
night, when Clinton spoke, had died down considerably by Tuesday,
according to Nielsen Media Research.

NIPPON'S WIRELESS UNIT IS SAID TO BE IN TALKS ON U.S. VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL with ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The wireless arm of Nippon Telegraph &AMP; Telephone of Japan, the
world's biggest communications company, is in preliminary
negotiations to acquire a minority stake in the pending wireless
joint venture between BellSouth Corp. and SBC Communications Inc.,
two of the local Bell telephone giants, people close to the talks
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the discussions were unclear Wednesday, but one
person close to the talks said the Japanese wireless unit, known as
NTT DoCoMo, was negotiating to buy no more than 20 percent of the
SBC-BellSouth venture.
</P>
<P>
   The venture could be worth more than $60 billion and would be
the second-biggest wireless operation in the United States after
the wireless joint venture between Verizon Communications, which
was formed by the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE Corp., and
Vodafone AirTouch of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The BellSouth-SBC venture would serve more than 16 million
customers and would offer wireless service to areas with more than
half of the nation's population.
</P>
<P>
   One person close to the talks added, however, that the
discussions were only in their earliest stages and could fall
apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not even baby talk,'' the person said. ``This is
babies looking at each other across the room.''
</P>
<P>
   The talks were reported Wednesday by the Web site of The
Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for BellSouth and SBC declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, NTT DoCoMo lost a battle to acquire another
U.S. wireless operation, VoiceStream Wireless Corp. VoiceStream
ended up agreeing to be acquired for $50 billion by another
overseas communications company that was looking for a U.S.
presence, Deutsche Telekom of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   SBC and BellSouth hope to win approval for their venture from
the Federal Communications Commission by the beginning of October.
</P>
<P>
   To compete against other national wireless providers like
Verizon, AT&AMP;T and Sprint, the SBC-BellSouth venture hopes to
acquire wireless licenses in the parts of the nation where it now
has none.
</P>
<P>
   NTT DoCoMo's deep pockets could help the venture acquire the
additional licenses it desires, which could cost billions of
dollars.

SPORTS COLUMN: OTHER PLAYERS TO TEST TIGER AT VALHALLA 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ When you think of Louisville sports, you think
of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs, or Muhammad Ali, who now
has a boulevard named for him. Or you think of all those Louisville
Slugger bats; the new minor league baseball stadium, Louisville
Slugger Field, with a statue out front of Pee Wee Reese, a local
marbles champion who grew up to be the captain and shortstop of the
``Boys of Summer'' Brooklyn Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   But with Tiger Woods in town, golf is suddenly center stage in
Louisville as never before.
</P>
<P>
   When Mark Brooks won the 1996 Professional Golfers Association
Championship in a sudden-death playoff with Kenny Perry here at the
Valhalla Golf Club, they put themselves and Louisville on the golf
map, but only briefly.
</P>
<P>
   Neither has won a PGA Tour event since then, and Valhalla hasn't
had another tournament until now.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods is at Valhalla to defend the PGA title he won last
year in a back-nine duel with the now 20-year-old Sergio Garcia of
Spain at Medinah No. 3 outside Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, the world will be watching to see if the
reigning U.S. Open and British Open champion can be the first to
win three consecutive major titles (or even three in one year)
since Ben Hogan won the Masters and the two Opens in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   But as well as Woods is likely to play, the PGA has a recent
history of somewhat surprising champions, occasionally even
somebody who emerged from relative obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   Woods dominated this year's two Opens as no other golfer ever
has, winning by 15 strokes at Pebble Beach and by 8 at St. Andrews.
But the more difficult the course, the more it favors a dominant
golfer. If Brooks and Perry were the best at Valhalla in 1996,
maybe less familiar names will create another PGA dogfight for
Woods, who openly sighed in relief when his winning putt fell last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Life is like that at the PGA, where the course is seldom set up
as treacherously as an Open course and where so many golfers have
had a chance to win. Over the last quarter of a century, the PGA
has had many more first-time or only-time major winners than the
Masters and the two Opens.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1975, there have been 10 golfers whose PGA title has been
their only major _ Davis Love III, Steve Elkington, Paul Azinger,
Wayne Grady, Jeff Sluman, Bob Tway, Hal Sutton, John Mahaffey and
Lanny Wadkins, as well as Brooks. And since 1975, the PGA was the
first major for six players who went on to win other majors _ Vijay
Singh, Nick Price, John Daly, Payne Stewart, Larry Nelson and David
Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Over that same span, the Masters was the only major for only
four golfers, and each of the Opens was the only major for six.
</P>
<P>
   So while Woods, according to the oddsmaker Danny Sheridan, is an
even-money favorite, look for somebody else to challenge him, if
not dethrone him _ maybe Ernie Els, Phil Mickelson or a mystery
guest (as Garcia was last year).
</P>
<P>
   Especially at Valhalla, designed by Jack Nicklaus, who will be
playing with Woods and Singh on Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sets up well for anybody who hits the ball high,'' Woods
said. ``That's the way Nicklaus courses are designed. You've got to
bring the ball in high. I've traditionally played well on Nicklaus
courses.''
</P>
<P>
   But why Valhalla? Isn't Valhalla just the name of the great hall
where the souls of Viking heroes feasted and celebrated with the
gods? And why is it suddenly Tiger Woods' latest stage for a major
title?
</P>
<P>
   In golf, major championships are usually held at courses aged by
time, tradition and history. In contrast, Valhalla is even younger
than Tiger Woods and nowhere near as mature. He's 24, it's only 14.
</P>
<P>
   But the PGA is here because the PGA of America, which rules the
nation's club pros, owns 50 percent of the Valhalla Golf Club and
by year's end will own all of it. The PGA is scheduled to return
here in 2006, followed by the Ryder Cup matches in 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Even Woods has said that an older, more traditional course, like
Baltusrol, the New Jersey brute that has held seven U.S. Opens,
would have been a ``better fit'' for the 2000 majors. So don't be
surprised if somebody else's name is a better fit on the PGA
trophy.  &QL;

WITHOUT HUISH, ARCHERS STILL HOPE TO HIT TARGET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NEVIN BARICH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You would think not having its individual gold
medal winner from 1996 would be tough to overcome for the U.S.
men's archery team, which also is trying to repeat as the Olympic
team gold medalist in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans lost one of the `96 Games' most popular athletes
when Justin Huish of Simi Valley withdrew from the team in March
after being arrested for alleged possession of marijuana with an
intent to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the U.S. returns two archers from `96, including Richard
``Butch'' Johnson of Woodstock, Conn., who also made the `92
Olympic team and holds three world records.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Johnson won the National Indoor Championship for the
sixth year in a row, took first in the Gold Cup and placed third in
the Arizona Cup and the German Grand Prix Tournament of Champions.
</P>
<P>
   The other members of the men's team are Rod White of Mt.
Pleasant, Iowa, a member of the `96 Olympic team he was fourth at
the U.S. Trials but was moved up when Huish withdrew
</P>
<P>
   and Vic Wunderle of Mason City, Ill., who easily won the trials
by 94 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll have a pretty good team, even a little better
than last time,'' White said. ``I think we might be better
shooting-wise.''
</P>
<P>
   The early indication is mixed. The team was fifth at the Sydney
International Golden Arrow last September and at the Golden Arrow
Grand Prix in Turkey in April. But at the Tournament of Nations in
Germany in May, the U.S. was a disappointing 15th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, we can shoot very well,'' returning men's coach Lloyd
Brown said. ``We've just had some problems getting them to perform
well together. They've done better individually. But hopefully,
we'll have that all worked out by the time we get to Sydney.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women are among the medal favorites with a strong blend
of youth and experience. Janet Dykman of El Monte is the lone
returnee from the 1996 team. She finished first at the U.S. Olympic
Trials last year and is hoping to lead the U.S. women to its first
medal since its bronze at Seoul in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, winning a medal is the biggest thing,'' said
Dykman, who helped the women to a team gold medal at the Golden
Arrow Grand Prix. ``I mean, it's not a life-or-death thing, but
yeah, that is the ultimate. What else would you be working so hard
for?''
</P>
<P>
   The women's team will also rely on the experience of Denise
Parker of Salt Lake City, who was the youngest archer to compete in
the Olympics when she made the 1988 team at age 14. Parker also
made the 1992 team but failed to qualify for the Atlanta Games. But
she's back for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen-year-old Karen Savatto of Enfield, Conn., won five
competitions this year, including the Junior World Trials. In 1999,
she won the individual gold medal at the Sydney International
Golden Arrow, her first international competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is among the best mixes of athletes I've ever seen
in my years of archery competition,'' Dykman said.
</P>
<P>
   Women's coach Nancy Myrick, coaching her first Olympic team,
agrees: ``All three women are shooting very well right now. All of
them are very equal, very seasoned and very hungry.''

LIEBERMAN STRESSES HUMBLE ROOTS AS HE ACCEPTS NOMINATION &HT;    (EDS: Edits and trims throughout)
 &HT;    (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)
 &HT;    By STEWART M. POWELL and DAN FREEDMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES Democratic vice presidential candidate Joseph
Lieberman, the first Jewish American nominated for a major party
ticket, told the Democratic National Convention Wednesday night
that the Gore-Lieberman team wants to extend the American dream to
those left behind _ including Texans, who he claimed were suffering
bad air, water and health insurance coverage under Gov. George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman delivered his nationally-televised address as
Democratic delegates formally nominated Al Gore and Lieberman to
carry the party's banner against Bush, in his second term as
governor of Texas, and Dick Cheney, the former defense secretary
turned oil services company executive.
</P>
<P>
   The 58-year-old senator from Connecticut offered ``some straight
talking'' about Republicans, delighting convention delegates with
the quip that the Republican presidential nominee's idea of school
modernization is ``buying a new calendar for every building.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman criticized Bush's record in Texas on air quality,
water purity and the absence of health insurance for large numbers
of women and children. He dismissed the Republican National
Convention two weeks ago in Philadelphia as pure theater, saying:
``We may be near Hollywood, but not since Tom Hanks won an Oscar
has there been that much acting in Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who credits the late President John F. Kennedy with
drawing him into public service, laid out the next step of the
Democrats' cherished ``New Frontier'' that was enunciated here in
Los Angeles by Kennedy in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the next frontier isn't just in front of us but
inside us to overcome the differences that are still between us ...
and to help every American claim the limitless possibilities of our
own lives,'' Lieberman declared. He quoted Gore to the effect that
``It's not just the size of our national feast that is important
but the number of people we can fit around the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, a graduate of Yale and Yale law school who was the
first in his family to attend college, recounted his humble origins
as the grand child of immigrants. His late father had lived in an
orphanage as a child, later drove a bakery truck on the overnight
shift and eventually owned a liquor store. Lieberman added:
``Sometimes I try to see this world as my dad saw it from his
bakery truck.'' He said his proud, 85-year-old mother sitting in
the convention hall ``never felt younger than she does today.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman called Gore ``a man of family and faith...a man of
courage and conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's wife, Hadassah, the Czech-born daughter of Holocaust
survivors, introduced her husband to the convention as a principled
public servant ``shaped by the values that are his heart and soul''
who also remained ``just a regular Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   An hour before Lieberman's speech, waves of protesters occupied
the streets outside the Staples Center, the site of the convention.
Waving ``New Trial for Mumia'' and ``Nader for President'' signs,
they formed human chains as police nervously lined up on either
side.
</P>
<P>
   Through a bullhorn, police gave the protesters 15 minutes to
leave the intersection. They complied and _ for the moment _
averted a repeat of mass arrests that occurred Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier at an airport rally welcoming Gore and his wife Tipper
who arrived in the Los Angeles area Wednesday afternoon, Lieberman
mischievously told more than 1,000 supporters crowded into a
airport hanger to escape punishing sunshine: ``I've been waiting
for a week to say this line and I can't control myself anymore, _
in this election, will you help me win this one for the Tipper?''
</P>
<P>
   Late polls showed Gore and Lieberman have their work cut out for
them. A Voter.com-Battleground tracking poll of likely voters
released Wednesday showed the Bush-Cheney ticket leading the
Gore-Lieberman ticket by 9 percentage points, 49 percent to 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's eldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, 27, a graduate of
Harvard and Columbia law school who often accompanies her father on
the campaign trail, nominated her father as president with touching
recollections of her father's help building a dinosaur diorama,
icing down an igloo for an overnight winter camp out and his
willingness to heartily embrace ``our big plans.'' She said her
father was a ``man of faith in the most gutsy, practical sense''
who ``wants to see goodness prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiff's address followed a well-received speech on Tuesday
night by Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, the 42-year-old daughter and
last direct relative of slain President John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., who would become
speaker of the House with a Democratic takeover of the House on
Nov. 7, made a pitch for a change of leadership in the House which
in recent years has been wracked by strident divisions between
Republican leaders and minority Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders ``don't communicate _ they dictate,''
declared Gephardt, an ally of organized labor who had been on
Gore's list of prospective running mates. ``Democracy deserves
better. Hear me: We will replace `my way or the highway' with `Our
way together,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates responded with a chant: ``Take back the House!
Take back the House!''
</P>
<P>
   California Gov. Gray Davis, in an indirect reference to Bush,
stirred delegates by telling them that Gore was ``not some
back-slapping good old boy. He is a serious man of substance.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pollster Frank Luntz, who advised the independent presidential
bid of Texas billionaire Ross Perot in 1992, said Gore's selection
of Lieberman has paid off because it ``caused people to take
another look at Gore,'' helping to cut Bush's lead over Gore from
19 percentage points to 2 percentage points. Luntz, who also
advised then-Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., on the 1994 campaign
manifesto ``Contract with America'' that helped the GOP to retake
the House and Senate for the first time since 1954, said Lieberman
helps Gore win back politically conservative Jewish Americans _ 40
percent of whom had voted for Ronald Reagan in 1984. There are
roughly 5.5 million Jews in the United States, 10 percent of whom
are Orthodox Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Since his election to the Senate in 1988, Lieberman has
fashioned himself into a moderate-to-liberal lawmaker best known
for occasional stands against Democratic doctrine, including
support for publicly funded ``vouchers'' for private schools,
opposition to affirmative action and condemnation of the
entertainment industry's exploitation of sex and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was the first Democratic senator to publicly condemn
President Clinton's sexual dalliance with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky. William Bennett, the self-styled chief Republican
morals guru, described Lieberman as ``the closest thing in the
Senate to an Old Testament prophet.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who ceases work on the Jewish Sabbath on Saturday,
says he will continue honoring the Sabbath and on three Jewish
holidays in the weeks before the Nov. 7 election. ``I'm just going
to do what I've always done and work extra hard on the days that
I'm campaigning,'' Lieberman said before his address.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's selection of Cheney also gave the GOP nominee a boost,
enabling Bush to boost his margin by 10 percentage points, from 6
percentage points before he chose Cheney to 16 percentage points
after the selection.

<P>
   Spike Jonze, the 29-year-old director of ``Being John
Malkovich,'' and one of the coolest filmmakers in Hollywood, picked
up the phone several weeks ago and got what he called one of the
biggest surprises of his life. The Gore campaign asked him to fly
to Nashville and hang out with Vice President Al Gore and his
family, and then make a movie about the Gores for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, whose supporters include such directors as Steven
Spielberg, Sydney Pollack, and Rob Reiner, could have probably
called on any filmmaker in Hollywood. But one of Gore's favorite
films in recent years is ``Being John Malkovich,'' which was
praised by critics as one of the most original and offbeat movies
in years.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Charlie Kaufman, the movie is about a struggling
puppeteer who finds a portal to the brain of actor John Malkovich
(played by the actor). As a result, people line up to be inside his
head. The movie is about the culture's obsession with fame; Jonze
has been one of the most successful directors of music videos and
commercials in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Jonze, whose real name is Adam Spiegel, and who is heir to the
Spiegel clothing catalog fortune, said that he just completed
editing the campaign film on Tuesday night. ``I was definitely
surprised when they called,'' he said. ``They asked me if there
were any ideas I had of the things I'd want to do. The idea was for
me to see what he really was like. I went to meet him. I bought my
little video camera. No crew. Just me and my camera.''
</P>
<P>
   The film has jagged MTV-style editing. It is an affectionate
portrait of a relaxed and laughing Gore at his family's farm, at
the dinner table with his wife and daughters, deciding what film to
watch on video, swimming in heavy surf at the beach and riding on a
military helicopter. In the film, Gore joked on Air Force Two about
his reputation as an uptight politician, pointing to his wife,
Tipper, who is barefoot. ``She insists on going barefoot _ it
completely messes up my image,'' he said. Tipper Gore cheerfully
replied: ``That's my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore even kidded about his role as vice president. ``The guy
standing motionless on stage behind the president _ what the hell
makes him think he can be president?'' Gore joked at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Jonze indicated that he never cared too much about politics _
until now. ``It was incredibly interesting to be around all that,''
he said. ``I liked him a lot. I had a fun day.''

<P>
   Hard Words on Soft Money  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing like watching two billionaires in a catfight
over money. The bad blood between the entertainment mogul David
Geffen and Eli Broad, the Los Angeles civic and financial leader,
continues. At a lunch Geffen served on Tuesday at his 9-acre,
15,000-square foot French chateau-style mansion in Beverly Hills _
which he bought for only $47.5 million in 1990 _ the mogul told
assorted movie and media stars that he was happy to have one of the
few parties here that didn't require a six-figure check for
admission.
</P>
<P>
   But Geffen has been the object of open criticism about not
writing a big check. The criticism has come from Broad, who with
Geffen was one of the co-chairmen of the host committee that lured
the Democrats to Los Angeles. Broad, who has even more billions
than Geffen, has said that Geffen backed out of his commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Geffen doesn't speak publicly of Broad. But someone close to
Geffen said he had given millions to the Democratic Party and was
not going to be ``intimidated'' by Broad into ``underwriting the
Democratic convention,'' which he said had been made clear from
``day one.''
</P>
<P>
   War Stories  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam. Thirty years ago the Democratic Party tried to forget
the war that began in the administration of John F. Kennedy and
reached its peak in the Lyndon B. Johnson years. But the convention
here is raising the Vietnam issue _ specifically who served there,
and who didn't _ in an effort to contrast Vice President Gore, who
served near Saigon, with his Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, two Democratic senators and combat veterans
wounded in Vietnam, Max Cleland of Georgia and Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska, were given prominent speaking roles. Thursday night,
several Vietnam veterans will introduce Gore, who served in the
military for two years and in Vietnam as an Army reporter. By
contrast, Bush served in the Air National Guard and was not called
to Vietnam. Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, used deferments to
avoid being drafted. And Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the Democratic vice
presidential candidate, also used deferments first as a student and
later as a parent. Lieberman has said that he has ``felt some
remorse'' about not serving.
</P>
<P>
   Who Needs Bunnies?
</P>
<P>
   Even without the Playboy mansion, Rep. Loretta Sanchez's
fund-raising bash for Hispanic lawmakers was hopping on Tuesday
night. Sanchez, D-Calif., had been pressured by party leaders to
drop the Playboy mansion as the spot for her blast, even though
Gore himself has accepted money from Hugh Hefner, the founder of
Playboy. The Democratic National Committee feared the Playboy party
would be a public relations debacle and run counter to the
Democrats' attempts to portray themselves as the party of family
values.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the party seemed most of all a huge public relations
coup for Sanchez, who held forth Wednesday night in a plunging
black gown and upswept hair as a hundred reporters and television
crews recorded her every word at B.B. King's Blues Club at
Universal Studio's City Walk, the new site of the party. ``Al Gore
has accepted money from Playboy,'' Sanchez said pointedly. ``And he
would have to give you his reasons as to what he's done with that
money and where it goes and why he takes it.''

EDITORIAL: WHAT JOE LIEBERMAN CAN DO 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Aug. 17:
</P>
<P>
   It was a long time in coming, but Wednesday night Vice President
Al Gore and Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut finally moved to
center stage at the Democratic convention. Gore's arrival in Los
Angeles and Lieberman's emotional speech accepting the vice
presidential nomination sought to move the party beyond its
tributes to the Clinton era and to present a new ticket with its
own agenda and less baggage. Lieberman's speech was a blend of
personal reminiscence and condemnation of Republican policies on
schools and health care. It was a forceful effort, clearing the way
for Gore's all-important address Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Lieberman has worked well for Gore, giving Gore
credibility as a risk-taker and tightening the polls. Since it also
stirred a few concerns in parts of the Democratic base, Lieberman
reached out to those groups in his speech. Addressing blacks and
liberals worried about his record on affirmative action, he spoke
of his family escaping tyranny in Europe and his lifelong fight
against discrimination. ``That's why I continue to say, when it
comes to affirmative action, mend it, don't end it,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   Other traditional Democrats say they are worried about
Lieberman's centrist philosophy challenging liberal orthodoxy on
school vouchers and privatization of Social Security. In response,
Lieberman offered a robust attack on Gov. George W. Bush's approach
to government and spoke of the ``real differences'' with the GOP
nominees, whom he spoke of as ``decent and likable men.'' He also
signaled the possibility of some tough oratory to come. In
Philadelphia, Bush had declared ``Don't mess with Texas,'' but
Lieberman drew cheers Wednesday night when he declared that for all
the Republican promises, Texas lagged seriously in health care and
cleaning up the environment. Scoffing again at claims by the Bush
campaign that he is actually closer to the Republicans, he
declared, ``I'm glad the GOP has changed their rhetoric, but I wish
they would also change their policies.''
</P>
<P>
   The attacks on Republicans were designed to assuage Democratic
liberals about battles they actually lost when President Clinton
moved the party to the center. For the larger national audience,
Lieberman's appearance was intended as a signal that this ticket
was moving beyond Clinton's behavioral _ as opposed to his policy _
legacy. Lieberman's authority in this regard derives from his moral
bearing, embodied in his criticism of Clinton's conduct two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it was a tricky exercise for Lieberman to assail
Clinton's conduct as immoral and also vote against his removal from
office, so has it been a balancing act for him to speak openly of
his deep religious conviction without crossing the boundary that
separates religion from the affairs of state. As the first Jew to
be nominated for vice president by a major party, he paid tribute
to his immigrant grandparents and to the ``only-in-America''
quality of his selection. Then he moved on to a combined moral and
economic message that will become a main Democratic theme. It is
not ``the size of our national feast that is important,'' he said,
``but the number of people we can fit around the table _ there must
be room for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the warmth of their response, the delegates in the
Staples arena know that a vice-presidential choice rarely makes a
decisive difference. But a vice-presidential candidate can help
establish an aura of confidence around a ticket. Gore's supporters
can hope that the selection of Lieberman attests to the ability of
their nominee to think originally, shatter the old barriers of
prejudice and feel comfortable with challenging ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman spoke fervently of his long admiration for and
friendship with Gore, as well as the ``private moments of prayer''
he had shared with him. But if Gore is to make an impression on the
public this week and walk out of the shadow of Clinton and the
waves of nostalgia that have washed over the convention since last
weekend, that work still belongs mainly to one person. His turn
will come Thursday night. &QL;

L.A. POLICE, PROTESTERS CLASH OUTSIDE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LISA TEACHEY 
and DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Police clashed with thousands of angry
demonstrators Wednesday outside the Democratic National Convention
but avoided the kind of confrontation that left several injured
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   As smiling Democrats lined up inside the Staples Center to laud
the attributes of standard-bearers Al Gore and Joseph Lieberman,
infuriated protesters outside the hall shouted at hundreds of
heavily armed police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Some protesters threw bottles, stones and other debris at
police, who responded with rounds of rubber bullets fired into the
crowd. Also, witnesses said, police used rubber bullets and
nightsticks to push photographers out of their way.
</P>
<P>
   A California Highway Patrol officer was struck in the chest. He
was taken to a hospital, a patrol official said.
</P>
<P>
   The officer was hit shortly after dusk as protesters drifted
away from a major intersection near the convention center after a
tense, hour-long standoff that appeared on national television to
have ended without incident.
</P>
<P>
   At the same intersection Monday night, police on horseback
charged into a crowd of protesters who set fire to trash piles
instead of leaving the area after a rock concert. Several rounds of
rubber bullets were fired as part of the effort to protesters from
the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's protest near the Staples Center followed a mass
rally at police headquarters in downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Complaining of what they described as ``mass incarceration,''
``police brutality'' and the taking of ``political prisoners,'' the
protesters burned a U.S. flag while officers in riot gear stood
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday evening, the total number of people arrested
during protests reached 189.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving police headquarters, hundreds of people marched
through the streets of downtown Los Angeles where business owners
had boarded their storefronts.
</P>
<P>
   En route, police shoved demonstrators and bystanders off the
sidewalks and into the streets. Officers fired rubber bullets at a
photographer standing in their way and pushed him to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Angry protesters then surged forward, shouting ``Shame! Shame!''
before police supervisors and rally organizers intervened and
stopped the incident from escalating.
</P>
<P>
   A television cameraman also claimed to have been hit by
baton-wielding police.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the American Civil Liberties Union prepared a
lawsuit _ which attorneys planned to file on Friday in federal
court _ accusing police of targeting journalists assigned to cover
Monday's street battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``A free press guards against tyranny and abuse of power, and
those who abuse power inevitably seek to control the images we see
and the stories we hear,'' said Ramona Ripston, executive director
of the ACLU's Southern California office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The LAPD on Monday evening illustrated these axioms starkly by
targeting members of the press as they were covering the LAPD's
massive, sweeping violations of individuals' civil liberties.''
</P>
<P>
   The Civil Liberties Union lawsuit names Al Crespo, a free-lance
photographer who is believed to have been shot three times with
rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether the police have been targeting reporters,
police spokesman David Kalish said ``absolutely, positively not.''
</P>
<P>
   In a more peaceful moment Wednesday, 37 protesters engaged in a
sit-in at the Rampart police station, a facility rocked by numerous
allegations of abuse by officers.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday evening, police arrested 70 bicyclists who
authorities argued were driving recklessly through the streets of
downtown Los Angeles. Among those arrested were two reporters,
Brian Bland of Associated Press Radio and Flynn McRoberts of the
Chicago Tribune. They were released after posting bail.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, police arrested 45 protesters who authorities
suspected of conspiring to break into and vandalize two business
that sell furs. The group also had allegedly targeted a McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they seized flammable materials, slingshots with
paint balls and make-shift flame throwers from the animal rights
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators allegedly were terrorizing employees at the
businesses, banging on windows and painting store signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We moved in and thwarted their attack,'' Kalish said.
</P>
<P>
   Police stopped street vendors from selling water to people using
the area designated by convention organizers for protests.
Previously, the water vendors had enjoyed a brisk business on the
streets outside the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going to happen ... when all these people start running
out of water?'' asked Donald Anderson, who had been selling water
around the convention site for several days. ``This is
ridiculous.''

DEMOCRATS ARE MORE PLUGGED IN, ANALYST SAYS &HT;     

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Of course Al Gore didn't invent the Internet, and
he never really said he did.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice president does know how to use it, according to
Internet researchers who say the Democrats are doing a slightly
better job than the Republicans in embracing their first national
convention on the information superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans had a lot of gizmos and they had a high `neat'
factor, but there was really nothing there. The reality didn't live
up to the hype,'' said Christopher Hunter, policy analyst and
Internet observer at NetElection.org, a research project at the
University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg Public Policy Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats appear to be a little better plugged in,'' he
said. ``They've got computer terminals at each delegation on the
convention floor where delegates will cast their votes. They have
360-degree cameras stationed around the Staples Center, and their
streaming video and `podium chats' are a very positive use of the
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Pseudo.com, a private company, had 360-degree cameras in
Philadelphia during the Republican National Convention. Here, the
Democrats themselves installed the same type of technology.
</P>
<P>
   While Texas Gov. and Republican presidential candidate George W.
Bush only mentioned the Internet once in Philadelphia _ in a joke
about Gore _ the vice president is expected to discuss the future
of the medium, as he has on the campaign trail. And Democrats also
are embracing another opportunity the Republicans neglected: The
Jumbotron at Staples Center frequently touts the party's Web site,
www.dems2000.com.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Purpuro, deputy chief of staff for the Republican National
Committee, has said that the GOP is not devoting as much energy to
promoting the Internet. A majority of Republicans are already
online, he said, and the private sector is doing a good job of
moving the technology forward.
</P>
<P>
   But while Democratic convention organizers may be more
enthusiastic Internet pioneers than their GOP counterparts, Hunter
said he is still somewhat disappointed: ``The Democrats so far
haven't delivered.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter and his fellow Internet users were most interested in the
Democrats' promised ``podium chats,'' touted as a chance to ask
questions of each departing speaker for 10 to 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   After Monday night's big speech by first lady and Senate
candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, Hunter logged on to see if he
could ask her a question. The response was essentially: We're not
doing that tonight. Check back tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm impressed that they did have live people on the other end
responding to us, but it wasn't really a chat, wasn't really live,
and I didn't get to ask one question of one speaker,'' Hunter said.

ROBERT B. WATSON, 86, FORMER HARVARD ADMINISTRATOR 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert B. Watson, dean of students at Harvard University during
the student uprisings of the late 1960s and later the driving force
behind the construction of sports facilities as the university's
athletic director, died on Aug. 12 at his home in Cataumet, Mass.
He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   A popular but firm administrator in the early part of his career
at Harvard, Watson was taken aback by the events of April 9, 1969,
when he and other administrators were forcibly removed from their
offices by student protesters at the height of the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   ``The breakdown of civility among students and faculty alike
were direct attacks on everything he stood for,'' said Zeph
Stewart, who was a senior tutor and house master at the time, ``and
he himself and his unwavering loyalty to the old Harvard became
targets of rebellion.''
</P>
<P>
   As Watson described it in 1987: ``Being a college dean then was
like living in the public square of a small city occupied by enemy
aliens. There was no place to take refuge from the maddening
crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Reared in the Boston suburb of Wellesley, Watson attended St.
Mark's School and graduated from Harvard in 1937 after lettering in
football and crew.
</P>
<P>
   After a few years at J.P. Morgan in New York, he joined the Navy
in 1940. He married Polly Blodgett about one month after the
bombing of Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   She survives him, along with three daughters, Gail Barber of
Bedford, Mass., Jeannie of Weston, Mass., and Joanne Watson
Spievack, of Cambridge, Mass.; two sons, Peter T., of Bainbridge
Island, Wash., and Robert Jr., of Richmond, Va.; a brother, Edward,
who lives in New Hampshire; and nine grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   During the war, Watson served as executive officer on the
destroyer Leary. He survived for five hours in the cold waters of
the North Atlantic when his ship was torpedoed on Christmas Eve
1943.
</P>
<P>
   He gave his life jacket to another man and clung to a piece of
wood until early morning, when another warship rescued him and 56
crew mates; the 220 other men on board died. He told his children
that his St. Mark's letterman sweater had saved his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thought that kept recurring was: what I should do with
my life if I was lucky enough to be picked up?'' he wrote later.
``The answer that came back repeatedly was: involve yourself in
some field relating to the young.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson returned to Harvard in 1946 as an associate dean,
becoming the college's first dean of students in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, he touched off a debate over the university's
enforcement of the hours during which students were allowed to
entertain women in their rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are public laws in this state,'' he said at the time,
``and it's our positive duty to deal with fornication just as we do
with thievery, lying and cheating, by taking severe disciplinary
measures against the offenders.''
</P>
<P>
   But arguments over parietal rules were timid compared with the
1969 protest against U.S. involvement in Vietnam and other
grievances. Students shoved and dragged Watson and eight other
deans out of the main administration building before locking the
doors with bicycle chains.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the deans watched as 400 policemen charged the
building and pulled the students, some of them bloodied, from the
hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those crazy times, it was really important to be as
straight and square as he was,'' said Fred L. Glimp, the dean of
Harvard College at the time, who was also forcefully removed in the
University Hall uprising. ``There wasn't much you could do about
the emotional issues, but you'd try to keep the students from
emotionally throwing themselves into impossible situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson served another year as dean and made dozens of court
appearances as students who took part in the first and three other
building takeovers were tried on charges of trespassing and
assault.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, he became athletic director and began a multimillion
dollar renovation of Harvard's sports facilities, which Glimp
called the ``most archaic in the Ivy League.'' Watson helped set in
motion projects that included building a pool and a track before he
retired in 1977.

HOMOSEXUALS HAVE SOME HIGH-PROFILE ROLES, BUT STAR TREATMENT A
MIXED BLESSING
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
By JULIE MASON &QL; 
C.2000 Houston Chronicle &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gays and lesbians are getting the star treatment
at this year's Democratic National Convention, turning up in
unprecedented numbers among the speakers and delegates.
</P>
<P>
   While that might be expected because they are a core
constituency of the party, some convention participants said this
year's high profile is a mixed blessing. That's because certain key
issues to the lesbian and gay community are not high on the
Democrats' agenda this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not forget that anyone can still be fired from their job
in 39 states, including Texas, for being gay,'' said Sloan C.
Wiesen, spokesman for the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund, a
Washington-based nonpartisan organization.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 4,370 delegates at the convention, 212 are lesbian, gay
or transgendered. At the recent Republican National Convention in
Philadelphia, 18 openly gay delegates also set their party's record
for attendance this year.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic podium, six convention speakers are
homosexual, and others, such as the parents of Matthew Shepard, a
gay University of Wyoming student who was murdered in 1998, are
speaking on related themes.
</P>
<P>
   But while nondiscrimination and anti-hate crime measures are
frequently invoked by gay and straight convention speakers, in many
states such laws remain goals for the Democratic Party rather than
achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Thornier issues rarely heard or publicly championed at the
convention include laws that would permit gay adoption and same-sex
marriage, neither of which is addressed in the party's platform.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many activists said they feel a growing tolerance in the
nation for lesbians and gays, and a welcome from the Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Army Col. Grethe Cammermeyer, a lesbian discharged from
the military in 1992 under its then-mandatory discrimination
policy, noted how far the party has come since 24 openly gay
delegates converged at the 1984 convention in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really do have an inclusive community and an inclusive
party,'' Cammermeyer said. ``We are part of the party that's going
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   And in an election year that has seen both major parties drift
to the center on issues such as education, trade and health care,
Republican and Democratic stances on gays at the convention provide
some of the sharpest contrasts to date.
</P>
<P>
   At the Republican Convention in Philadelphia, U.S. Rep. Jim
Kolbe, an openly gay Republican from Arizona, gave a speech during
prime time on the issue of free trade.
</P>
<P>
   Some delegates that evening expressed their disapproval by
either boycotting the speech or bowing in prayer during his
address.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats gave a prime-time speaking spot to Elizabeth Birch, a
lesbian mother of twins who is president of the Human Rights
Campaign, the nation's largest gay and lesbian political
organization.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the convention this week, the Gay and Lesbian
Victory Fund hosted a brunch in West Hollywood that raised $200,000
for its mission of electing qualified, openly gay public officials.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of the gay and lesbian community's clout within the
party, the event featured appearances by House Minority Leader
Richard Gephardt and Energy Secretary Bill Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Wiesen, who called the confluence ``historic,'' said gay and
lesbian Democrats generally agree the easier issues with broader
consensus are the ones that should be tackled first.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're dealing with conflict, you don't target the
hardest, most divisive and emotional issues first,'' Wiesen said.
``If people are in agreement on some of the more basic issues like
discrimination, let's make that the law of the land first and then
go on to squabbling over other things.'' &QL;

LIEBERMAN STRESSES HUMBLE ROOTS AS HE ACCEPTS NOMINATION &HT;    (EDS: inserts new 5th graf with reaction from Bush spokesman)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES Democratic vice presidential candidate Joseph
Lieberman, the first Jewish American nominated for a major party
ticket, told the Democratic National Convention Wednesday night
that the Gore-Lieberman team wants to extend the American dream to
those left behind _ including Texans, who he claimed were suffering
bad air, water and health insurance coverage under Gov. George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman delivered his nationally-televised address as
Democratic delegates formally nominated Al Gore and Lieberman to
carry the party's banner against Bush, in his second term as
governor of Texas, and Dick Cheney, the former defense secretary
turned oil services company executive.
</P>
<P>
   The 58-year-old senator from Connecticut offered ``some straight
talking'' about Republicans, delighting convention delegates with
the quip that the Republican presidential nominee's idea of school
modernization is ``buying a new calendar for every building.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman criticized Bush's record in Texas on air quality,
water purity and the absence of health insurance for large numbers
of women and children. He dismissed the Republican National
Convention two weeks ago in Philadelphia as pure theater, saying:
``We may be near Hollywood, but not since Tom Hanks won an Oscar
has there been that much acting in Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer later issued a statement
saying: ``It's disappointing to witness the senator's increased
partisanship and changing convictions but it is also evidence that
Al Gore is leaving his mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who credits the late President John F. Kennedy with
drawing him into public service, laid out the next step of the
Democrats' cherished ``New Frontier'' that was enunciated here in
Los Angeles by Kennedy in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the next frontier isn't just in front of us but
inside us to overcome the differences that are still between us ...
and to help every American claim the limitless possibilities of our
own lives,'' Lieberman declared. He quoted Gore to the effect that
``It's not just the size of our national feast that is important
but the number of people we can fit around the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, a graduate of Yale and Yale law school who was the
first in his family to attend college, recounted his humble origins
as the grand child of immigrants. His late father had lived in an
orphanage as a child, later drove a bakery truck on the overnight
shift and eventually owned a liquor store. Lieberman added:
``Sometimes I try to see this world as my dad saw it from his
bakery truck.'' He said his proud, 85-year-old mother sitting in
the convention hall ``never felt younger than she does today.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman called Gore ``a man of family and faith...a man of
courage and conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's wife, Hadassah, the Czech-born daughter of Holocaust
survivors, introduced her husband to the convention as a principled
public servant ``shaped by the values that are his heart and soul''
who also remained ``just a regular Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   An hour before Lieberman's speech, waves of protesters occupied
the streets outside the Staples Center, the site of the convention.
Waving ``New Trial for Mumia'' and ``Nader for President'' signs,
they formed human chains as police nervously lined up on either
side.
</P>
<P>
   Through a bullhorn, police gave the protesters 15 minutes to
leave the intersection. They complied and _ for the moment _
averted a repeat of mass arrests that occurred Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier at an airport rally welcoming Gore and his wife Tipper
who arrived in the Los Angeles area Wednesday afternoon, Lieberman
mischievously told more than 1,000 supporters crowded into a
airport hanger to escape punishing sunshine: ``I've been waiting
for a week to say this line and I can't control myself anymore, _
in this election, will you help me win this one for the Tipper?''
</P>
<P>
   Late polls showed Gore and Lieberman have their work cut out for
them. A Voter.com-Battleground tracking poll of likely voters
released Wednesday showed the Bush-Cheney ticket leading the
Gore-Lieberman ticket by 9 percentage points, 49 percent to 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's eldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, 27, a graduate of
Harvard and Columbia law school who often accompanies her father on
the campaign trail, nominated her father as president with touching
recollections of her father's help building a dinosaur diorama,
icing down an igloo for an overnight winter camp out and his
willingness to heartily embrace ``our big plans.'' She said her
father was a ``man of faith in the most gutsy, practical sense''
who ``wants to see goodness prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiff's address followed a well-received speech on Tuesday
night by Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, the 42-year-old daughter and
last direct relative of slain President John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., who would become
speaker of the House with a Democratic takeover of the House on
Nov. 7, made a pitch for a change of leadership in the House which
in recent years has been wracked by strident divisions between
Republican leaders and minority Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders ``don't communicate _ they dictate,''
declared Gephardt, an ally of organized labor who had been on
Gore's list of prospective running mates. ``Democracy deserves
better. Hear me: We will replace `my way or the highway' with `Our
way together,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates responded with a chant: ``Take back the House!
Take back the House!''
</P>
<P>
   California Gov. Gray Davis, in an indirect reference to Bush,
stirred delegates by telling them that Gore was ``not some
back-slapping good old boy. He is a serious man of substance.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pollster Frank Luntz, who advised the independent presidential
bid of Texas billionaire Ross Perot in 1992, said Gore's selection
of Lieberman has paid off because it ``caused people to take
another look at Gore,'' helping to cut Bush's lead over Gore from
19 percentage points to 2 percentage points. Luntz, who also
advised then-Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., on the 1994 campaign
manifesto ``Contract with America'' that helped the GOP to retake
the House and Senate for the first time since 1954, said Lieberman
helps Gore win back politically conservative Jewish Americans _ 40
percent of whom had voted for Ronald Reagan in 1984. There are
roughly 5.5 million Jews in the United States, 10 percent of whom
are Orthodox Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Since his election to the Senate in 1988, Lieberman has
fashioned himself into a moderate-to-liberal lawmaker best known
for occasional stands against Democratic doctrine, including
support for publicly funded ``vouchers'' for private schools,
opposition to affirmative action and condemnation of the
entertainment industry's exploitation of sex and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was the first Democratic senator to publicly condemn
President Clinton's sexual dalliance with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky. William Bennett, the self-styled chief Republican
morals guru, described Lieberman as ``the closest thing in the
Senate to an Old Testament prophet.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who ceases work on the Jewish Sabbath on Saturday,
says he will continue honoring the Sabbath and on three Jewish
holidays in the weeks before the Nov. 7 election. ``I'm just going
to do what I've always done and work extra hard on the days that
I'm campaigning,'' Lieberman said before his address.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's selection of Cheney also gave the GOP nominee a boost,
enabling Bush to boost his margin by 10 percentage points, from 6
percentage points before he chose Cheney to 16 percentage points
after the selection.

CISNEROS WARMLY RECEIVED, BUT COY ABOUT RETURN TO PUBLIC OFFICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
By CLAY ROBISON &QL; 
C.2000 Houston Chronicle &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Fallen star Henry Cisneros was warmly greeted by
Texas Democrats on Wednesday, but he remained coy about whether he
ever will take another shot at public office.
</P>
<P>
   The former Clinton Cabinet member and San Antonio mayor, whose
political career was derailed by an extramarital affair and a
federal indictment, seemed to rule out a race for governor in 2002
or any other campaign in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   But he left the door open for other political opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never is a long time, you know. Never, never. You know, 10
years from now I'll be a little old but who knows?'' he told
reporters after speaking to Texas delegates to the Democratic
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can tell you is I've made choices and gotten people to
invest in a business with the assurance that this is what I'm going
to dedicate myself to for a very long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, 53, moved back to San Antonio, his hometown, last week
after a 7{-year absence to launch a company that will concentrate
on building affordable housing with a major homebuilder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no plan to run for office, no ambition. I swear to you
I want to get on the ground in San Antonio and get to work, and
it's going to be very challenging work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros said he intended to remain active in civic affairs and
in rebuilding the Texas Democratic Party. He said he also will
spend a limited amount of time campaigning for presidential
candidate Al Gore this fall if he is asked to do so.
</P>
<P>
   He said he planned to support Laredo businessman Tony Sanchez
Jr., who is expected to announce later this year that he will seek
the Democratic nomination for governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   At present, Democrats, who once had a stranglehold on Texas
politics, hold no statewide elected offices in Texas. And Cisneros,
despite his personal baggage, is viewed by some as the party's best
shot at recapturing a major statewide office.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office and the U.S. Senate seat held by
Republican Phil Gramm will head the statewide ballot in Texas in
2002.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he would do if he were recruited to run for governor
or the Senate, Cisneros replied: ``There are other people who can
do a better job at it, and (whom) I would be happy to back.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros was mayor of San Antonio for eight years and then
headed the Department of Housing and Urban Development during
Clinton's first term.
</P>
<P>
   His affair with former fund-raiser Linda Jones, made public in
1988, led to a federal investigation that Cisneros had lied about
payments to Jones during an FBI background check into his
nomination as HUD secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros ended the case last year by pleading guilty to one
misdemeanor charge and paying a $10,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros returned to San Antonio from Los Angeles, where he
spent the past 3{ years as president and chief operating officer of
Univision Communications Inc., the nation's largest
Spanish-language television network.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros told Texas Democrats that Gore was more qualified for
the nation's highest office than ``any person who has run for the
presidency'' because he has been intimately involved with White
House decision-making for eight years.

THE PERSONAL TOUCH IS NOW PARTY PROTOCOL 
</HEADLINE>
  By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Karenna Gore Schiff, the candidate's daughter, on
Wednesday night filled the role once played by governors, senators,
former presidents and former first ladies by seconding her father's
nomination to be president, praising him in prepared remarks for
balancing family and government work, and helping her with a
dinosaur diorama after a long day of congressional hearings.
</P>
<P>
   In their unending quest to make national conventions into sunny
talk shows they hope the networks will broadcast, the parties have
banned internal party argument over policy, serialized roll calls
over three nights and miniaturized important speeches (except by
President Clinton).
</P>
<P>
   The keynote speech, a first-night event intended to set a
convention tone (and to propel a speaker like Harold Stassen or
Earl Warren or Mario Cuomo into national prominence) vanished
entirely from the Republican calendar. Here among the Democrats, it
might as well have. Rep. Harold E. Ford Jr. of Tennessee, a
30-year-old second termer, delivered it as the second night's
session ended, after the networks had quit.
</P>
<P>
   Nominating speeches were first used to persuade delegates to
vote for a candidate. Once nominees began to be settled before
conventions began, their purpose became persuading a party and a
nation of the breadth of his support.
</P>
<P>
   Today, if any purpose remains, it is to humanize and
depoliticize. Two weeks ago in Philadelphia, the Texas Republican
with the second most at stake in the election, Lt. Gov. Rick Perry,
nominated his boss in less than a minute: ``Mr. Chairman and fellow
delegates, I am proud to nominate the current governor of the great
state of Texas and the next president of the United States _ George
W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a formality, preceding the formality of the
state-by-state roll call that the party's rules have not gotten
around to eliminating as a time-wasting relic of the past. But
those pronouncements were administered in small doses over three
days.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's presentations, a nomination by Tommy Lee
Jones, Gore's Harvard roommate, and seconding speeches by Schiff
and Lois M. DeBerry, a Tennessee legislator, were personal
reflections. Joe Andrew, national chairman of the Democratic Party,
said they could answer an important question about Gore: ``What
kind of decisions did you make before you were in government?''
</P>
<P>
   Other speakers, he said, dealt with issues and Gore's record in
government. Indeed they have, sometimes with a level of
exaggeration that Gore himself would envy. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
for example, credited Gore with helping pass the children's health
insurance legislation, when, in fact, Gore followed White House
orders in May 1997, and disappeared, after promising Kennedy he
would come to the Senate to break a tie by voting for the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's speakers were chosen, Andrew said, to help
America ``know Al Gore more as a person.'' The same assignment will
fall Thursday to the candidate's wife, Tipper, and she will use
photographs she has taken to help make her point.
</P>
<P>
   Jones may have a political following, but only in Hollywood, and
Schiff and Mrs. Gore have none at all. But the Democrats, like the
Republicans, are counting on their conventions as television shows,
not as tools for party unity.
</P>
<P>
   And if there is one thing they fear more than a long speech, it
is the disease of dissent. Bush's campaign officials not only
thwarted debate about abortion or a new primary calendar, they
deemed it destructive to let delegates debate for a few minutes
about whether to make Republican National Committee members
automatic delegates.
</P>
<P>
   And Democrats, congenitally incapable of marching in perfect
lock step, confined their uncertainty about whether the party was
liberal enough to grumbling to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   It is true, of course, that disagreement and uncertain outcomes
would make news and perhaps persuade the television networks to pay
more attention. But that raises the fear that a party that fights
over something would look bad to the public.
</P>
<P>
   One veteran Republican, Bill Brock, the former national
chairman, disagrees. ``A convention without contest,'' he said ``is
a convention without a lot of heart ...''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Martin J. Plissner, the retired executive political
director of CBS News, put it, keynotes, nominating speeches and
platform fights ``go back to the era when conventions had decisions
to make.''

TORRES WON'T BOW TO GODS OF YOUTH, WINNING TRIAL AT 33
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Dara Torres won the women's 50-meter freestyle
Wednesday night in 24.90 seconds, becoming, at age 33, the oldest
woman to win a race at the U.S. Olympic swimming trials. Her
half-minute swim, however, was preceded by hours of instruction
from an entourage of 10 experts who aided her in everything from
her psychological state to her nutrition to the manipulation of her
lymph system.
</P>
<P>
   After a layoff of seven years, in which she worked as a fashion
model and a television commentator, Torres returned to swimming a
year ago and has now qualified to swim three individual events and
three relays next month at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   It is unprecedented for anyone to return to an elite level of
swimming after so many years away from the sport. During her
retirement everything changed, from the way strokes are performed
in the water to the way athletes eat and train.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Quick, coach of the U.S. women's Olympic swim team and
Torres' personal coach in Palo Alto, Calif., said swimmers have
become a bit like race cars, spending minutes at peak performance
and hours in the body shop being tinkered with by mechanics. In
races decided by hundredths of a second, the slightest advantage
can be significant.
</P>
<P>
   Quick's methods have been productive at the trials. Jenny
Thompson, one of his swimmers, won both the women's 100-meter
butterfly and 100-meter freestyle. Torres won the 50-meter
freestyle and finished second in the 100-meter butterfly and
100-meter freestyle. Misty Hyman won the 200-meter butterfly. As
the trials concluded Wednesday night, Torres defeated the reigning
Olympic champion in the 50 freestyle, Amy Van Dyken, who finished
second in 24.99, continuing her own comeback from shoulder surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford group is hardly the only one to develop a training
regimen as high-tech as the bodysuits worn at these trials. Gary
Hall Jr. won the men's 50-meter freestyle on Tuesday with a
nutritional regimen that resembles that of Fusaichi Pegasus, the
winner of the Kentucky Derby, according to Hall's coach in Phoenix,
Mike Bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Quick said his idea for an inclusive regimen came from an
article he read about how Martina Navratilova traveled with a
psychologist, nutritionist and strength coach during her heyday on
the women's tennis circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, wow, how could I put that in place for swimmers?''
Quick said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he paid the expenses at the trials for a 10-person group
that included a nutritionist, two massage therapists, a physical
therapist, a performance expert, a lymph system manipulator, a
chiropractor, two stretching experts and an instructor in Pilates,
a strength and stretching regimen. Torres and Thompson also pay
separately for strength training with Robert Weir, a British discus
and hammer-throw champion.
</P>
<P>
   Torres works four to six hours a day outside the pool on various
aspects of her physical and mental preparation, Quick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people wonder how she achieved so much so quickly,''
he said. ``I guarantee that if you follow her around for one week,
you'd be exhausted just by the schedule. She's crowded two to three
years of training into 13 months.''
</P>
<P>
   The experts have agreed to work without pay, Quick said, adding
that he had created a foundation to raise $90,000 to $100,000 to
pay for their travel and housing expenses at the Olympics. Half the
money remains to be raised, with the Summer Games beginning on
Sept. 15. He will borrow money, if necessary, to get the entourage
to Sydney, Quick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to have these athletes shortchanged at the most
critical moment in their careers,'' Quick said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Torres won two gold medals on relay teams before retiring in
1992. Her resurgent career represents the possibilities now
available to women in the age of professional Olympic sports a
generation after the gender-equity mandate of Title IX. Prize money
and endorsements sustain careers that, three decades ago, were
forced to end in high school. But Torres has needed acute vigilance
to remain at the top into her 30s.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Luepnitz, a nutrition expert, monitors Torres'
protein-laden diet of six meals a day, and he draws her blood every
two weeks to analyze her oxygen-carrying capacity, lactic acid
buildup and immune system. He gives her up to 25 supplement pills a
day. Richard Diana, a performance expert, is a proponent of Knowing
Awareness Thinking, which aids athletes in achieving a confident,
uncluttered mind-set before races.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of building confidence,'' Quick said. ``You can
have a fire to train and still not have confidence to perform.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale Perry massages Torres' lymph system to help rid her body of
toxins. A pair of trainers, Bob Cooley and Tom Longo, perform
Meridian Resistance Flexibility exercises, which include walking
over her legs and her back to relax the muscles. Team Torres also
uses a device to help cool her after races, putting a rubberized
sleeve around her legs and pumping in cold water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of it has to do with nutrition'' Torres said of
her resurgence. ``Richard is one of the best coaches in the world.
He knows how to train sprinters. He's added a lot of recovery into
our workouts. The weight training is different and the mental
attitude is different.''
</P>
<P>
   Because so little is known about women performing at their peak
into their 30s, however, the Torres regimen remains one of trial
and error. She said her tired legs gave out on her in the 100-meter
freestyle, and she has experienced repeated cramping during the
trials.

UCLA, cautioned that athletes who take supplements risk testing
positive for some banned substances because of improper labeling.
Dr. Gary Green, an internist at UCLA who is head of the NCAA's
drug-testing program, said few peer-reviewed studies had been done
to correlate the effect of supplements on performance enhancement.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to show scientifically whether legal supplements
can mimic the effects of banned drugs is for athletes to take the
supplements and then take steroids, and then compare the
performances, Green said. ``No one is going to do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The most direct impact on performance could be a placebo effect,
he said. And even high-tech gadgets, Quick said, ``can't substitute
for hard work, dedication and consistent effort.''

<P>
   Raymond J. Broderick, a former federal judge who closed a
Pennsylvania institution for the retarded and disabled and ruled
that Philadelphia should not have paid for a platform for a papal
visit, died on Aug. 6 in a retirement community in Gladwyne, Pa. He
was 86.
</P>
<P>
   He stepped down from the U.S. District Court in Philadelphia on
June 5. A Republican, he was appointed in 1971 by President Richard
M. Nixon after serving as Pennsylvania's lieutenant governor and
running unsuccessfully for governor.
</P>
<P>
   The Pennhurst Center for the Mentally Retarded in Spring City,
Pa., had over 10,000 residents when Judge Broderick ordered it
closed in 1977. He ruled that keeping the retarded in such large
institutions violated the equal protection clause of the
Constitution by denying them the education and training that could
be provided in smaller, community-based units.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ruled in 1979 that the city of Philadelphia violated
the separation of church and state when it built a platform for an
appearance by Pope John Paul II. He ordered the archdiocese to
reimburse the city $204,569 for the cost.
</P>
<P>
   The judge was born in Philadelphia and earned his law degree
from the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife, Marjorie; three sons; two daughters and
10 grandchildren.

MARY K. WELLS, 79, ACTRESS KNOWN FOR ROLES IN SOAP OPERAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb., N.Y.)   By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mary K. Wells, who acted in films, theater,
television and radio and was part of a writing team that won two
daytime Emmy Awards, died on Aug. 14. She was 79 and lived in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was an infection of the colon, said her son, Cameron
Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, whose childhood ambition was to become an actress, began
her career in small roles in Hollywood films like ``Here Come the
Waves'' (1944) and ``The Searching Wind'' (1946). But on the advice
of a Paramount Pictures casting director who advised her that
sustained performance, rather than a burst of personality, was her
forte, Wells moved to New York in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving during the heyday of radio, the infancy of television
and the maturity of Broadway, she embarked on a career that endured
until her retirement in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Her television credits included classics of the 1950s like ``Big
Town,'' in which she played Lorelei Kilbourne, a crusading reporter
for The Illustrated Press in the 1950-51 season; the ``Philco TV
Playhouse''; ``Playhouse 90''; ``Robert Montgomery Presents; and
``The Milton Berle Show.''
</P>
<P>
   In theater she appeared in plays like George Abbott's ``Three
Men on a Horse,'' with Sam Levene and Jack Gilford; in Edward
Albee's ``Everything in the Garden''; and in ``Any Wednesday'' with
Gene Hackman and Sandy Dennis.
</P>
<P>
   From 1961 to 1970 she played the role of Louise Capice, an
upper-class suburban wife on the daytime soap opera ``The Edge of
Night.'' In 1974 she joined the writing staff of the ABC soap opera
``All My Children.'' She was part of the teams that won Emmys for
outstanding drama series writing for the 1984-85 and 1987-88
season.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, who was born in Omaha, Neb., on Dec. 1, 1920, was reared
in Los Angeles by her divorced mother, Mary Ludwig Wells. Wells
said that from the age of 5 she wanted to become an actress, and
when she grew up she managed to get an audition at Paramount, which
led to her career.
</P>
<P>
   Her marriage to Donald Richardson, a television director, ended
in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her son, who lives in Manhattan, she is survived
by a daughter, Katherine O'Keeffe of Kent, Ohio, and four
grandchildren.

 &HT;    CONVENTION PROTESTS SIMMER BUT DON'T BOIL OVER
 &HT;    By MIKE WAGNER and KATHEY PRUITT
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A protest Wednesday by more than 5,000
demonstrators, mainly targeting police brutality, started with an
Indian war chant, flirted with violence and ended with mild
skirmishes.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters and police shoved each other during several minor
altercations during the two-mile march that started at downtown's
Pershing Square and ended at the Staples Center, the convention
site. While waiting to enter the area designated for protests,
demonstrators hurled bottles and other objects at police.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hate the police, the police don't like them much either,
and this convention was like a timer on the bomb that's been built
between them,'' said the Rev. Jim Conn, a Methodist minister from
nearby Long Beach who attempted to calm the crowd. ``I just hope it
doesn't blow up. The past history of this city, the heat and all
the media coverage is a recipe for something bad to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The images of police facing off with protesters is nothing new
to Los Angeles and the kind of attention the Democratic Party was
hoping to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   The march did little to wipe away memories of the videotaped
police beating of Rodney King, which led to the city's 1992 riots.
Los Angeles and violence were again in the spotlight earlier this
summer when vandals set fires and rampaged local businesses after
the Los Angeles Lakers' NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's demonstration continued a week of convention
protests that at times have disrupted state delegates and occupied
the national media.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the convention's first day, violence erupted after a
concert by Rage Against the Machine, an anti-authoritarian band
from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Officers, some on horseback, charged into a crowd of 8,000
protesters, dispensing pepper spray and rubber bullets to disperse
the crowd. Some of the 300 protesters engaged with police responded
by throwing pylons, cans, bottles, asphalt and a
handicapped-parking sign. At least four people were hurt, none
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The intensity of Wednesday's march rose when the demonstrators
stopped in front of Los Angeles police headquarters. They spewed
profanity at the officers, burned American flags and threatened to
``take out'' any officer who laid a hand on a protester.
</P>
<P>
   Long rows of officers, fully decked out in riot gear, surrounded
the demonstrators and kept the protest from spilling into other
streets. Unlike Monday, police showed restraint when confronted by
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Some officers returned stone cold looks to the insults and video
cameras that were thrust inches from their helmets. Others officers
laughed at the chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them are these 15-year-old kids who need a good
spanking from their parents,'' said Officer Dan MacDonald, who was
on the front line of the protest and started laughing when one
protester fell hard from a skate board. ``They ought to bring in
ice cream trucks and they might go away.''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators represent a diverse collection of causes and
political stripes. Many are protesting corporate globalization, the
death penalty, treatment of the homeless and several prisoners they
believe are innocent.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters were led by a truck displaying hundreds of names
and pictures of people around the country who demonstrators say
were killed in altercations with police. The demonstration began
around noon in Pershing Square where about 10 people told personal
stories of family members who died in fights with police or while
serving a jail sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Before the march, many of the police and protesters were talking
and even joking with each other. ``It's our job to keep this
peaceful and show these people that we all live together,'' said
Lt. Don Farrell.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many of the protesters said the cops were itching for a
fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want peace, they want to keep hitting and killing
people,'' said Whitney Zack, a New Yorker who led much of the
protest. ``We live in fear of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The protest spilled into the area surrounding the convention,
but ran into a wall of police, which led to a 50-minute stand-off
between the groups. The protesters linked arms, forming a human
chain in front of police.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, six hours after the protest began, police negotiators
were able to persuade the demonstrators to move out of the area.
Police threatened to arrest any protesters who continued to linger
near a blocked-off intersection.
</P>
<P>
   The convention ends Thursday and police expect a final round of
protests.
</P>
<P>
   Some delegates said they were ``saddened'' and ``angry'' that
the protests outside the convention have taken center stage from
politics and the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here to fight for Al Gore, not watch a bunch of people
fight outside,'' said one delegate from Kansas, who didn't want to
be identified. ``It seems like Al Gore just can't catch a break in
this election.''

 &HT;    Ohioan goes from teaching to being Cowboys' placekicker
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas - Tim Seder gave up nearly everything in
his personal and professional life to become the Dallas Cowboys'
placekicker.
</P>
<P>
   Seder quit his teaching job in Ohio, indefinitely left his wife,
traveled 1,000 miles to a new city, rented a studio apartment,
found a roommate and kicked a football until the Cowboys were
satisfied they had their man.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Seder was a three-sport coach at Lucas High School in
Mansfield, Ohio. When he returned home from basketball practice one
day in the dead of winter, his life took a dramatic change.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I walked in the house, my wife said I'd better listen to
the answering machine,'' Seder said Wednesday during a break at
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   The call was from Steve Hoffman, kicking coach for the Cowboys.
There was a job opening in Dallas, and Hoffman wanted the
25-year-old teacher to apply. The salary and perks were good ...
but there was a catch.
</P>
<P>
   Seder's chances of making the squad were about 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Seder temporarily kissed his wife Melissa goodbye and followed
his dream of playing in the NFL. Who would have figured that
someone from tiny Ashland University who had not played competitive
football in three years would be offered that type of a deal?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not Seder.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the NFL was concerned, I never thought I'd have a
shot to kick,'' Seder said. ``I thought I was going to be coaching,
and I was striving to become better at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Seder's first tryout for Hoffman was memorable. Seder walked
into Texas Stadium with old soccer shoes that had holes on the
sides. When Hoffman asked him about his style of footwear, Seder
quietly said, ``That's all I got, coach.''
</P>
<P>
   When Seder's first kicked missed badly, Hoffman rolled his eyes,
wondering how he could make such a mistake. Seder responded by
nailing several in a row, all with tremendous height and distance.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman's hunch about Seder was starting to look good.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Cowboys called, Seder had never sniffed an NFL team.
He was not drafted after finishing college three years ago. He was
never a free agent. No team gave him much thought until Hoffman did
some research.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman, the NFL's only full-time kicking coach, was sorting
through a stack of nearly 200 videos when he came across a dark and
grainy tape of Seder kicking a football in a high school gym.
Former Ashland assistant coach Dave Jaumotte, now with the Detroit
Lions, told Hoffman at the 1998 NFL combine in Indianapolis that he
knew of a kicker _ Seder _ with great potential.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman contacted Seder and requested a tape. Seder's kicking
technique was good, Hoffman recalled, but the Cowboys were already
satisfied with their kicker, Richie Cunningham. So Seder's tape was
thrown into a stack with dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman laughs when he talks about the tapes he receives almost
daily. He has tapes of kickers from Arizona State, Washington and
Michigan, not to mention England and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman's favorite came from a man who attempted 50-yard field
goals on a rainy afternoon. The kicker's young sons chased the
footballs. The ball always landed short of the goal post, splashing
in a mud puddle in the end zone. That tape no longer is part of
Hoffman's stack.
</P>
<P>
   Seder's story is important because the Cowboys entered training
camp without an experienced kicker on their roster. After two good
years, Cunningham lost his accuracy _ and his confidence _ midway
through the 1999 season. Veteran Eddie Murray finished the season,
but the Cowboys began to search for a young kicker who would make
the league minimum, $193,000.
</P>
<P>
   Seder performed well at a minicamp in April, earning himself a
spot on the summer roster, and became the No. 1 kicker when the
Cowboys released his only challenger, Rian Lindell, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The deeply religious Seder said he is ``blessed'' to be with the
Cowboys. When he signs autographs after practice, he writes Bible
scriptures about trust and confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Seder credits Hoffman for his early success with the Cowboys.
Among his adjustments, Seder has removed a ``hop-step'' on his
kicking approach to provide better balance.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman and Coach Dave Campo said Seder's ability is matched
only by his confidence. He has made three of four field goals
during preseason games _ his only miss was from 58 yards _ and
earned the job by outkicking Lindell in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the hard part. Nothing really matters until the Sept.
3 opener against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kicking business is a day-to-day scenario,'' Campo said.
``He knows he will be under scrutiny. He has two more (preseason)
games to get ready for the regular season.''
</P>
<P>
   As Seder learned early, all it takes is a phone call to get _ or
lose _ a job. If he fails, the Cowboys will look for another
kicker. Murray is available. So are NFL veterans Chris Jacke, Scott
Blanton and Chris Boniol.
</P>
<P>
   If Seder pans out, it will be another Hoffman discovery. The
coach has a knack for finding obscure kickers who become amazingly
accurate under his guidance.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of the Cowboys' theory that kickers should never
be high-priced players. Hoffman must find hidden gems, give them
some polish and save the franchise money by staying away from
big-name veterans.
</P>
<P>
   That suits Hoffman just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to sign a kicker that's going to be here for 10
years, why would (team owner) Jerry Jones want me around?'' Hoffman
said. ``If we sign Morten Andersen, I'm out of a job.''

ANGELS LOSE BUT AVOID BIGGER DISASTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The Anaheim Angels endured one loss Wednesday
afternoon but avoided a second and potentially more devastating
loss before 32,497 at SkyDome.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Delgado's two-run homer off Angels reliever Lou Pote in
the bottom of the ninth inning lifted the Toronto Blue Jays to an
8-6 victory. The good news for the Angels came while they packed
their bags for New York - Tim Salmon, who was hit on the left thumb
by a line drive while on third base, returned from the hospital
with the news that X-rays were negative.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon was on third with one out in the sixth inning when batter
Troy Glaus ripped one at him as he led off third base in foul
territory. He raised his hands to protect his face and the ball got
him on the thumb. He stayed in the game for the moment and scored
on a single by Glaus but then left for the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was hurting and it was throbbing,'' Salmon said.
``The first thing that comes to your mind is maybe you broke it.
I'm thinking, 'OK, what's going to happen next?' You think of all
the negative things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had my fair share of freak things. Fortunately it's not
broken. And it's not on the joint, so it shouldn't give me any
trouble holding the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon will be re-evaluated today and his status is listed as
day to day. Glaus, who hit his team-leading 35th home run earlier
in the game, was relieved Salmon was OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to react,'' Glaus said. ``You just hope to save
all the important parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Glaus' homer, the Angels also got a homer from Darin
Erstad (No. 20), three hits from Kevin Stocker and took a 5-3 lead
into the bottom of the seventh inning. But Angels starter Scott
Schoeneweis gave up a couple of hits and a run before Angels
manager Mike Scioscia went for help.
</P>
<P>
   In came Mark Petkovsek, who was pitching in his third
consecutive game and fifth in the club's past six games. He fell
behind in the count 2-0 to Tony Batista, when Batista launched a
two-run homer to left that gave the Blue Jays a 6-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, guys are stretched a bit,'' Scioscia said of a tired
bullpen. ``You'd like to give them a breather here and there. You
want to finish not only healthy but strong. Without Al (Levine) and
(Troy Percival), those are two big voids that have to be filled in
the set-up roles and middle relief roles.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis might have gotten out of the inning himself had he
been able to field a sharp grounder back at him by Delgado. Instead
of turning an inning-ending double play, the ball caromed off his
glove to second baseman Adam Kennedy, who got the out at first.
</P>
<P>
   But it allowed one run to score and kept the inning alive for
Batista.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stepped on the mound and said 'Let's get a ground ball right
back to you,' '' Schoeneweis said. ``Then, bam, a ground ball right
back to me. I can't believe what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow you wake up and it's one more in the loss column, no
more, no less,'' Scioscia said. ``Guys are playing hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Koch (6-2) worked a perfect ninth for the victory.

LIEBERMAN STRESSES HUMBLE ROOTS AS HE ACCEPTS NOMINATION &HT;    (EDS: inserts new grafs 15-16 with Gore appearance at
convention.)
 &HT;    (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)
 &HT;    By STEWART M. POWELL and DAN FREEDMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES Democratic vice presidential candidate Joseph
Lieberman, the first Jewish American nominated for a major party
ticket, told the Democratic National Convention Wednesday night
that the Gore-Lieberman team wants to extend the American dream to
those left behind _ including Texans, who he claimed were suffering
bad air, water and health insurance coverage under Gov. George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman delivered his nationally-televised address as
Democratic delegates formally nominated Al Gore and Lieberman to
carry the party's banner against Bush, in his second term as
governor of Texas, and Dick Cheney, the former defense secretary
turned oil services company executive.
</P>
<P>
   The 58-year-old senator from Connecticut offered ``some straight
talking'' about Republicans, delighting convention delegates with
the quip that the Republican presidential nominee's idea of school
modernization is ``buying a new calendar for every building.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman criticized Bush's record in Texas on air quality,
water purity and the absence of health insurance for large numbers
of women and children. He dismissed the Republican National
Convention two weeks ago in Philadelphia as pure theater, saying:
``We may be near Hollywood, but not since Tom Hanks won an Oscar
has there been that much acting in Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer later issued a statement
saying: ``It's disappointing to witness the senator's increased
partisanship and changing convictions but it is also evidence that
Al Gore is leaving his mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who credits the late President John F. Kennedy with
drawing him into public service, laid out the next step of the
Democrats' cherished ``New Frontier'' that was enunciated here in
Los Angeles by Kennedy in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the next frontier isn't just in front of us but
inside us to overcome the differences that are still between us ...
and to help every American claim the limitless possibilities of our
own lives,'' Lieberman declared. He quoted Gore to the effect that
``It's not just the size of our national feast that is important
but the number of people we can fit around the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, a graduate of Yale and Yale law school who was the
first in his family to attend college, recounted his humble origins
as the grand child of immigrants. His late father had lived in an
orphanage as a child, later drove a bakery truck on the overnight
shift and eventually owned a liquor store. Lieberman added:
``Sometimes I try to see this world as my dad saw it from his
bakery truck.'' He said his proud, 85-year-old mother sitting in
the convention hall ``never felt younger than she does today.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman called Gore ``a man of family and faith...a man of
courage and conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's wife, Hadassah, the Czech-born daughter of Holocaust
survivors, introduced her husband to the convention as a principled
public servant ``shaped by the values that are his heart and soul''
who also remained ``just a regular Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   An hour before Lieberman's speech, waves of protesters occupied
the streets outside the Staples Center, the site of the convention.
Waving ``New Trial for Mumia'' and ``Nader for President'' signs,
they formed human chains as police nervously lined up on either
side.
</P>
<P>
   Through a bullhorn, police gave the protesters 15 minutes to
leave the intersection. They complied and _ for the moment _
averted a repeat of mass arrests that occurred Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier at an airport rally welcoming Gore and his wife Tipper
who arrived in the Los Angeles area Wednesday afternoon, Lieberman
mischievously told more than 1,000 supporters crowded into a
airport hanger to escape punishing sunshine: ``I've been waiting
for a week to say this line and I can't control myself anymore, _
in this election, will you help me win this one for the Tipper?''
</P>
<P>
   Late polls showed Gore and Lieberman have their work cut out for
them. A Voter.com-Battleground tracking poll of likely voters
released Wednesday showed the Bush-Cheney ticket leading the
Gore-Lieberman ticket by 9 percentage points, 49 percent to 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made a brief surprise appearance on the podium after his
eldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, 27, a graduate of Harvard and
Columbia law school, delivered a nominating speech recalling her
father's affectionate devoting to his family. She recounted his
help building a dinosaur diorama, icing down an igloo for an
overnight winter camp out and his willingness to heartily embrace
``our big plans.'' She said her father was a ``man of faith in the
most gutsy, practical sense'' who ``wants to see goodness
prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, arms extended, thanked the delegates and the roll call of
the states began.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., who would become
speaker of the House with a Democratic takeover of the House on
Nov. 7, made a pitch for a change of leadership in the House which
in recent years has been wracked by strident divisions between
Republican leaders and minority Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders ``don't communicate _ they dictate,''
declared Gephardt, an ally of organized labor who had been on
Gore's list of prospective running mates. ``Democracy deserves
better. Hear me: We will replace `my way or the highway' with `Our
way together,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates responded with a chant: ``Take back the House!
Take back the House!''
</P>
<P>
   California Gov. Gray Davis, in an indirect reference to Bush,
stirred delegates by telling them that Gore was ``not some
back-slapping good old boy. He is a serious man of substance.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pollster Frank Luntz, who advised the independent presidential
bid of Texas billionaire Ross Perot in 1992, said Gore's selection
of Lieberman has paid off because it ``caused people to take
another look at Gore,'' helping to cut Bush's lead over Gore from
19 percentage points to 2 percentage points. Luntz, who also
advised then-Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., on the 1994 campaign
manifesto ``Contract with America'' that helped the GOP to retake
the House and Senate for the first time since 1954, said Lieberman
helps Gore win back politically conservative Jewish Americans _ 40
percent of whom had voted for Ronald Reagan in 1984. There are
roughly 5.5 million Jews in the United States, 10 percent of whom
are Orthodox Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Since his election to the Senate in 1988, Lieberman has
fashioned himself into a moderate-to-liberal lawmaker best known
for occasional stands against Democratic doctrine, including
support for publicly funded ``vouchers'' for private schools,
opposition to affirmative action and condemnation of the
entertainment industry's exploitation of sex and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was the first Democratic senator to publicly condemn
President Clinton's sexual dalliance with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky. William Bennett, the self-styled chief Republican
morals guru, described Lieberman as ``the closest thing in the
Senate to an Old Testament prophet.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who ceases work on the Jewish Sabbath on Saturday,
says he will continue honoring the Sabbath and on three Jewish
holidays in the weeks before the Nov. 7 election. ``I'm just going
to do what I've always done and work extra hard on the days that
I'm campaigning,'' Lieberman said before his address.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's selection of Cheney also gave the GOP nominee a boost,
enabling Bush to boost his margin by 10 percentage points, from 6
percentage points before he chose Cheney to 16 percentage points
after the selection.

DAVID H. BLEE, 83, CIA SPY WHO REVISED DEFECTOR POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ David Henry Blee, a legendary U.S. spymaster who
played a critical role in dispelling the climate of paranoia that
paralyzed the CIA's espionage operations against the Soviet Union
in the 1960s, died on Aug. 4 at his home in Bethesda, Md. He was
83.
</P>
<P>
   Placed in charge of the CIA's Soviet Division in 1971, Blee made
a historic break with the agency's eccentric chief of
counterintelligence, James Jesus Angleton, effectively ending
Angleton's broad and destructive influence over the agency's
operations against Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Angleton's belief that virtually every Soviet citizen
who tried to defect was actually a double agent sent to dupe the
Americans, the agency's operations against Moscow had been tied in
knots for years. Angleton's theories had prompted the CIA to rebuff
many Soviets who tried to offer their spy services, and ultimately
led to the secret imprisonment under brutal conditions of one KGB
officer who defected to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Although as chief of counterintelligence Angleton was not in the
agency's Soviet Division, his long tenure as chief spy hunter gave
him enormous influence. Angleton's belief that the CIA was falling
prey to a KGB ``monster plot'' of deception led to a witch hunt for
Soviet moles within the agency. Careers were destroyed as one
longtime agency officer after another came under suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   But Blee, a longtime Middle East hand, rejected Angleton's
theories and threw open the doors to defectors and potential Soviet
spies, an approach that younger intelligence officers eagerly
embraced. Blee, a Harvard-educated lawyer, avoided an open
confrontation with Angleton as he ordered the 180-degree shift.
</P>
<P>
   With the backing of agency's director, William E. Colby, Blee
brought in lieutenants he had worked with in the Middle East and
South Asia who had not been tainted by the Angletonian mole hunt.
They reinvestigated long-neglected espionage leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the architect of the program that turned the
clandestine service back on target against the Soviets after all
the years of Angleton,'' said Haviland Smith, a former CIA officer.
</P>
<P>
   Blee's policy shift quickly bore fruit; in the 1970s the number
of well-placed spies working behind the Iron Curtain increased
sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Blee's success can be indirectly measured by the number of
Soviet spies working for the United States who were betrayed by
Aldrich Ames, a CIA officer in the Soviet Division. In 1985, when
Ames began to spy for the KGB, he turned over the names of at least
10 Soviet intelligence officers working for the agency. The KGB was
shocked by how deeply it had been penetrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a greater intellectual command of overseas operational
activity than any officer I ever knew,'' said Clair George, a
former agency deputy director of operations.
</P>
<P>
   David Henry Blee was born in San Francisco on Nov. 20, 1916, and
graduated from Stanford University in 1938. After graduating from
Harvard Law School in 1942, he enlisted in the Army in 1943. After
a brief assignment with the Army Corps of Engineers, Blee was
transferred to the Office of Strategic Services, the wartime
predecessor to the CIA. He joined a small team that was landed by
submarine on the islands off the coast of Thailand to monitor the
Japanese fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The excitement of wartime clandestine operations got into his
blood, and he joined the nation's new peacetime spy service when it
was founded soon after World War II. He stayed until his retirement
in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   One of Blee's biggest early triumphs came in 1965, when he was
the CIA station chief in India. Svetlana Stalin, the daughter of
the late Soviet dictator, showed up at the U.S. Embassy and asked
for political asylum. In an interview this year, Blee recalled that
while Washington dithered about how to respond, he put her on an
airplane and spirited her out of the country to safety.
</P>
<P>
   He soon became chief of the CIA's Near East Division, which
handled espionage in the Middle East, before taking over the Soviet
Division in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Blee ended his career in the same job that Angleton had occupied
for so many years, running the agency's counterintelligence
operations.
</P>
<P>
   He retired just as the CIA was coming to grips with the most
serious betrayal by one of its own officers up to that time, the
defection of Edward Lee Howard, a CIA case officer who had been
fired just before his scheduled assignment to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Before his dismissal, Howard had already been briefed on many of
the agency's most sensitive operations in the Soviet Union,
including the case of Adolf Tolkachev, a Soviet aviation design
expert who had given the CIA a trove of secret information on
Soviet military aircraft. What was not known at the time of Blee's
retirement, however, was that another intelligence officer, Ames,
had volunteered to the Soviets just as Howard was being exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Blee is survived by his wife, Margaret Gauer Blee; four sons,
John David and Robert Henry, both of Bethesda, David Cooper, of
Alexandria, Va., and Richard Earl, of Washington; a daughter,
Elizabeth Blee Fritsch of Washington; and four grandchildren.

MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What's the biggest misconception about Democrat Al
Gore?
</P>
<P>
   A panel convened by the American Enterprise Institute and the
Brookings Institution on Wednesday dealt with that issue.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what the speakers said:
</P>
<P>
   ``He will be bolder as a president than he is as a candidate.
That's part of his history.'' _ Gore biographer David Maraniss.
</P>
<P>
   ``The misconception is, he'll be capable of achieving real
reform. Because to do that he's going to have to contend with
people who have been implacable foes of education reform in this
nation.'' _ former California Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a man of strong opinions, but most of them were
expressed in private over the last eight years. He's going to face
a challenge in trying to sell the idea to voters that he was a
player.'' _ Gore biographer Bill Turque.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Bill Bradley's candidacy died, Al Gore is now positioned
to become the single best basketball-playing president in the
history of the United States. He is that good. I don't think he
gets the full credit for that.'' _ U.S. Rep. Edward J. Markey of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will take a great interest in international affairs.'' _
former Democratic Sen. James Sasser of Tennessee, a former
ambassador to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we never talk about is the reason why Al Gore has
been so passionate about issues of technology and the environment
and global warming and so on is not because they are academic...but
it's because they affect people, and he understands they are things
that will affect people into the next century. You cannot ignore
the fact that pollution still does kill children, and technology
does improve the lives of people living in rural areas.'' _ Roy
Neel, Gore's former chief of staff.

SPORTS COLUMN: EASY NIGHT FOR GOLIATH _ THIS TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. &UR;  &LR; _ The tiny island of Barbados has not a single
yard of railroad track, exactly one airport and only one regular
television channel. Put 11 Bajans on a field with 11 Americans,
however, and who knows what could happen?
</P>
<P>
   This was the operative theory early Wednesday night, as this
small nation represented gigantic fear and trembling to the United
States, or at least to that small segment of Americans aware of the
threat.
</P>
<P>
   This is the menacing charm of soccer, because one stinker of a
game, one wayward ball, one flub, one grotesque penalty call, can
upset millions of dollars' worth of preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The little minnow gets a chance to beat the big guy,'' said
Bruce Arena, the coach of the U.S. national team, who was dependent
on beating Barbados Wednesday night to have realistic chance of
qualifying for the 2002 World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   The minnows did not fluster the Yanks, and there were fewer of
them as the game progressed. Two Bajans were tossed out in the
first half for gratuitous fouls, and the Americans went on to
overpower them, 7-0, which is precisely what logic would dictate
against a nation of a quarter of a million residents.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, however, never have a reason to be relaxed in
World Cup soccer. The bigger soccer nations generally thump them,
and the smaller soccer nations scare them, at least.
</P>
<P>
   The land of the Whoppers, the land of Clinton, the land of
Jordan, the land of various Simpsons, the land of Madonna, had
every chance of being embarrassed by an island 2 1/2 times larger
than Washington.
</P>
<P>
   This is not some kind of Dream Team game, in which Charles
Barkley could come out and mock Angolans. This is a sport in which
the Americans do not dominate, a healthy anomaly given the way the
United States distributes its burgers and its sneakers and its
icons all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks were humbled by Germany, by Iran, by Yugoslavia,
during the 1998 World Cup, and each of those losses was perfectly
understandable.
</P>
<P>
   The World Cup qualifying rounds produce the true terror. The
United States must meet all these modest countries from Central
America and the Caribbean, with their aspirations, their
resentments, their youth kicking tattered soccer balls or perhaps
even stuffed socks, while U.S. youth are playing with their
computers and watching Derek Jeter and Keyshawn Johnson get their
exercise for them.
</P>
<P>
   Every four years, it comes around. The United States had to go
down and suffer a draw with Guatemala in a small town chosen for
its isolation, which it did in early July.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the month, in Costa Rica, in a stadium jammed with
people who get only a few chances in life to root against Goliath,
the United States lost when a Jamaican referee made an imaginative
hand-ball call on an U.S. defender whose hands were placed,
textbook-style, at his sides.
</P>
<P>
   The rule in soccer is, get your draws on the road and your
victories at home _ particularly against the little nations. There
was not great national pressure Wednesday night. The majority of
Americans are enjoying the pennant races, keeping an eye on
football training camps, vaguely aware that the Summer Games are
coming up next month.
</P>
<P>
   This is not Italy, where if the national team had one point on
the road and about to play Liechtenstein, all of Italy would come
grinding to a stop like one of those four-hour strikes they love to
pull.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer nations quiver in a spot like this. Italy lost the final
of the European Championship last month, and its coach, the
national hero, Dino Zoff, resigned after his strategy was publicly
criticized.
</P>
<P>
   While Arena does not have a nation on his back, he did have a
few impetuous types at the U.S. Soccer Federation watching how the
Yanks performed Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I feel the pressure,'' Arena said. ``I probably put
pressure on myself, but this is how I earn my living. I don't take
it lightly. We haven't started well.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbados had stunned Costa Rica at home, using only one
prominent professional, Gregory Goodridge, 28, who plays for
Bristol City in England's Second Division.
</P>
<P>
   Never having budgeted for this second round of qualifying games,
the Barbadian federation is going more broke with every game. Its
team was ranked 102nd in the world while the United States was
ranked 19th, but there was always the chance of a ball skittering
any which way, producing chaos. Wednesday night Goliath shrugged
off the minnows. It is not usually that easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the nature of the game,'' said Arena, who is quite
intelligent enough to see the sick humor of the process, which the
rest of the world enjoys.

CITY SHUTS UNLICENSED CHINESE MEDICAL CLINIC 
</HEADLINE>
   By SARAH KERSHAW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Over the last three years, a clinic in Queens has
claimed to have treated thousands of patients, most of them Chinese
immigrants, offering everything from traditional herbal medicine to
cancer treatments. But neither the clinic nor its doctors were
licensed, the authorities said Wednesday after shutting it down and
arresting six people.
</P>
<P>
   At Main Street and 39th Avenue in Flushing, the heart of the
large Chinese immigrant community in Queens, the third-floor clinic
used three names, including the New York Beijing Hospital of
Traditional Chinese Medicine, said Richard A. Brown, the Queens
district attorney. Investigators shut it down Tuesday and arrested
the hospital's owner and five others on its staff, Brown said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the clinic came to the attention of the authorities
after a patient who became infected after a gynecological procedure
sued for malpractice, and the doctors there said they could not be
sued for malpractice because they did not have licenses. The woman
said that doctors had given her an improper herbal prescription
after they removed an intrauterine device. She became ill and had
to spend 12 hours in a hospital emergency room, according to court
papers and her lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they seized thousands of medical files,
handwritten and in Chinese, from the center, where doctors in white
lab coats wore stethoscopes and tended to patients on examining
tables. Law enforcement officials said they were trying to
determine how many patients had undergone medical procedures in the
clinic.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic advertised heavily in Chinese-language newspapers. At
its Web site, www.theworldhealth.com, it claimed to have diagnosed
thousands of illnesses since its founding in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   An advertisement in The World Journal, the city's largest
Chinese-language newspaper, pictures one of the doctors and reads,
``Famous doctor; good, secret, unique prescriptions.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation underscores the difficulties of regulating
underground medical clinics that cater to immigrants. Unlicensed
storefront clinics and herbal medicine shops that treat patients in
their back rooms are common in Flushing, doctors and other experts
say. They attract uninsured immigrants who may be more comfortable
using Chinese medicine and seeking treatment from other immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the clinics are staffed by medical personnel who
were licensed in their native countries but who have not been
certified in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   All six of the unlicensed Flushing doctors had trained as
physicians in China and were licensed there, said their lawyer,
Hugh H. Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Mo, who is representing three of the doctors in the civil
lawsuit brought by the patient who had the gynecological treatment,
said that despite the clinic's advertising for other services, ``it
is a legitimate business that sells Chinese herbs and food
supplements.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities charged the clinic's owner, Shou Dong Wang, 42,
of Bayside, his wife, Jing-Yi Hao, 41, and another doctor, Guo-Wu
Liu, 84, of Elmhurst, with second-degree assault in connection with
the surgery performed on the patient.
</P>
<P>
   They were also charged with second-degree reckless endangerment,
with a scheme to defraud other patients and with violating a state
education law requiring a medical license. They face up to seven
years in prison, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Three other doctors, Ying Ming Liu, 71, and Pei-Song Guo, 49,
both of Flushing, and Jiu-Song Kan, 31, of Elmhurst, were charged
with a scheme to defraud patients and with violating state
licensing law and face up to four years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   All six were arraigned Wednesday and all but Wang, the owner,
who was released on a $5,000 bail, were released without bail.

 WHILE wOODS EYES HISTORY, HIS OPPONENTS EYE HIM  
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ For anyone not named Tiger Woods, it has
become even more difficult to win major championships.
</P>
<P>
   The domination of Woods and the challenge facing his competitors
have become the main themes heading into the PGA Championship,
which begins Thursday at Valhalla Golf Club. By winning three of
the last four majors, the last two in runaway fashion, Woods has
made a clear statement that he is the world's best player, by a
wide margin.
</P>
<P>
   If Woods wins this weekend, he will become the first player
since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win three consecutive majors, another
milestone for the player who has put an indelible stamp on golf at
age 24.
</P>
<P>
   But while Woods is chasing history, where does that leave
everyone else? There is a new sense of urgency among the world's
other top players, who realize that with Woods taking most of
golf's biggest prizes recently, there isn't much left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, Tiger is going to be the player to beat for the
foreseeable future,'' said Darren Clarke of Ireland, who defeated
Woods earlier this year at the Andersen Consulting Match Play
Championship. ``He's probably going to win two out of the four
majors every year. That is going to leave two for other players to
win. The fact that Tiger is going to play so well gives less
opportunity for the rest of us to win. Any time you have a chance
to win a major, it has more importance now than it did before.''
</P>
<P>
   So with world-class players like Colin Montgomerie, Phil
Mickelson and Lee Westwood still looking for their first major
championship, the year's final major will have an intense feel to
it. All eyes will be on the 9:13 a.m. threesome featuring Woods,
Vijay Singh and Jack Nicklaus, whose mother, Helen, died Wednesday
at age 90 in Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his mother's death, Nicklaus announced Wednesday that he
would play in the tournament to honor her wishes. But at age 60,
Nicklaus could be playing his final PGA Championship, and his peers
and the gallery realize the magnitude of that fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of major championships, you think of Jack
Nicklaus,'' Tom Lehman said. ``As long as I have been playing golf,
he has always been teeing it up in the majors. It will be very
strange not to see Jack's name on the roster in a major
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Nicklaus won 18 majors, including five PGA
Championships, most players would settle for just one. Some great
players have never won the PGA Championship, including Arnold
Palmer and Tom Watson. And the PGA has been the most difficult
major to defend. Nobody has won back-to-back PGA Championships
since Denny Shute in 1936 and 1937, so Woods figures to sweat this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, everyone will have to sweat. With midday temperatures
about 90 degrees this week, along with high humidity, anyone who is
not in shape will suffer. Woods' shirt has been drenched during
practice rounds, and players will have to drink plenty of fluids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never sweated as much in my whole life,'' said Sergio
Garcia, who lost to Woods by one stroke in an exciting back-nine
duel at last year's PGA.
</P>
<P>
   But the heat may be more intense on several players who believe
they are overdue to win a major. Among this group is Montgomerie,
who has won the European Order of Merit seven consecutive times,
but has never won a tournament in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie looked good Wednesday, having lost 20 pounds since
the British Open. He hoped having less weight would improve his
stamina, and his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just woke up one morning and said, `I don't want to be
overweight anymore,''' he said. ``I decided to go on a very strict
diet and fitness regimen. It is going to be somebody very tough
that is going to win this, mentally as well as physically.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the U.S. Open, where par was a good score for everyone
except Woods, Valhalla should allow players on top of their games
to shoot low scores. All four par 5's are reachable in two shots,
and though the rough is thick, the fairways are generous.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe that Valhalla is the perfect place for a player to
win his first major, but time will tell. Six of the last seven
majors have been won by players who had already won one. Paul
Lawrie, who won last year's British Open, was the only exception.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how much people analyze this tournament, Woods
will be the main focus, and how he plays on Thursday and Friday
will go a long way toward setting the tone of the event. The last
two majors haven't been close, and Woods shows no pity,
particularly in majors. Will anyone beat him at Valhalla? We are
about to find out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger has taken it to a different level,'' Montgomerie said.
``Everybody has to get to the next level if they want to compete.
When Michael Jordan started playing basketball, people had to
improve to compete. When Carl Lewis started running, people had to
improve. When Pele played football, people had to improve. Muhammad
Ali was the same. He raised the standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger is the best player in the world by a long, long way, and
we have to raise our standards to join his. We're all trying. We
are all failing, but we are all trying.''

SMITHSONIAN'S CONVENTION COLLECTORS ATTRACT A LOT OF ATTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Paul Doak pulled the shiny, bright-blue Bill
Bradley button out of his pocket and prepared to put it in his
briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   A simple transfer. A few seconds in time. But long enough for
Harry Rubenstein to decide he wanted that button.
</P>
<P>
   He pounced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Harry Rubenstein with the Smithsonian,'' he told Doak,
handing over his business card. Yes, THAT Smithsonian, the big one
in Washington. ``We'd like to have that button.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the floor of the Democratic National Convention near
his fellow Democrats from New Mexico, Doak was dubious. Give away
his prized button? Just like that?
</P>
<P>
   After all, Doak was on Bradley's New Mexico steering committee.
The button was designed especially for convention supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about a trade?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never trade,'' Rubenstein said. Sensing Doak's reluctance,
Rubenstein played his trump card.
</P>
<P>
   Come to Washington someday, he said. ``I'll give you a private
tour of the collection.''
</P>
<P>
   Deal sealed. And another piece of American political history
made the transition from private ownership to a permanent place in
America's best-known museum, which already houses the microphone
that Franklin D. Roosevelt used for his fireside chats and Thomas
Jefferson's lap desk.
</P>
<P>
   Rubenstein is only part of the Smithsonian's team on the 2000
campaign trail. Since 1988 he has been teamed with Larry Bird, the
other half of the museum's ``Harry and Larry'' team.
</P>
<P>
   They are an eye-catching duo. Larry is the taller one, a
6-footer with a striking pair of bright-red gym shoes on his feet.
Harry is 5 feet 7 and carries a small, red backpack.
</P>
<P>
   Both have gray hair. Both are 49-year-old curators at the
Smithsonian's Museum of American History. Both carry large, black
portfolios in which they carry away their historic treasures.
</P>
<P>
   The two sometimes complete each other's sentences. Asked how
people feel when they are asked for a donation, Bird said, ``Tons
of doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Rubenstein, ``Their first response always is ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Incredulity,'' Bird said.
</P>
<P>
   The two don't take just anything.
</P>
<P>
   Of course they seek the funny hat and the witty placard. More
important, they want pieces that tell the story of the convention.
So this week they have gathered up signs dealing with health care _
``Affordable Rx Drugs for Medicare'' read one _ because Democratic
speakers keep mentioning a patients' bill of rights and a
prescription drug benefit for seniors.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the night the former senator from New Jersey and Al
Gore's lone rival for the nomination spoke to the convention, the
pair looked for Bradley souvenirs. After talking to Bradley
supporters, Bird and Rubenstein came away impressed that support
for Bradley remained high.
</P>
<P>
   That became part of the convention's story. So the Bradley
button was something Rubenstein wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're lucky you got that,'' Doak said as he handed over the
button. And then he offered a final, only half-in-jest warning to
Rubenstein. ``I'm going to come out there, and I'd better see it,''
he said about the button.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be there, Rubenstein said, before continuing his
meanderings on the convention floor.
</P>
<P>
   Said Doak later: ``I'm giving it to a good cause. The
Smithsonian is a national treasure.'' Rubenstein's no-nonsense
approach also helped. ``He looks like a man of his word.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday when the Kennedys spoke, Bird and Rubenstein
scrambled to come up with the prized souvenir of the night _ a
narrow, blue-and-white placard that simply said, ``Caroline.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The things we're often looking for are what people can't give
up in the moment,'' Rubenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Republican convention in Philadelphia the two snatched a
hand-written sign that read, ``McCain-iacs for Bush,'' which said
something about the bitter struggle that Sen. John McCain of
Arizona waged with George W. Bush for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like spontaneous stuff,'' Bird said. ``An act of spontaneity
in an otherwise homogenized event.''
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia the duo also snagged one of their most valuable
souvenirs ever _ a $15,000 camera that produced a 360-degree view
of the convention floor for the Pseudo.com Web site. Why? The
camera signaled the Internet's new prominence in dispensing
political information.
</P>
<P>
   Bird had to do some fast talking with Pseudo Chief Executive
David Bohrman to get the camera. Fortunately for the Smithsonian,
Bohrman had a strong sense of history.
</P>
<P>
   The two prowl the floor, usually in tandem, their big portfolios
sometimes drawing quizzical stares. The objective is to take away
more stuff than they probably can use; don't want to come up
short-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest fear,'' Bird said, ``is someone someday will pull
open a drawer and say, `Man, they sure missed it. What were they
thinking?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The two have plenty of memorabilia from which to pick.
Democrats, for example, race out dozens of mass-produced signs from
a storage room beneath the bleachers before major speakers make
their entrance.
</P>
<P>
   But Bird and Rubenstein have noticed that delegates have become
more eager to haul home mass quantities of signs. At times that
makes it more difficult to find the items they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's collecting because of eBay,'' Rubenstein said of the
Internet site that features people selling every type of heirloom
imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Another hurdle: The Smithsonian almost never pays for donations.
</P>
<P>
   The two usually start slowly in convention weeks so that they
can size up the crowd and the gathering. That the two have become
media darlings of a sort also has slowed them down. All kinds of
reporters have been attracted to their mission, making them the
subject of features in The New York Times and on the Today show.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years they have learned some lessons about their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what you need until you see it,'' Bird said.
</P>
<P>
   Another one: ``There's never one item that says it all,''
Rubenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's this, from Rubenstein: ``It's still amazing to me
how generous people are.''

EDITORIAL NOTEBOOK: POLITICAL ADVISERS ON HOW GORE CAN APPEAR
PRESIDENTIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELEANOR RANDOLPH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now comes the moment when Vice President Al Gore gives his big
speech, and most knowledgeable Democrats have the good sense to be
scared to death. Gore's best attributes do not shine past the
teleprompter, and over the years, the microphone has not been his
friend.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, advice on how to make a smashing acceptance speech
does not come cheap. Who knows what it cost to wipe that smirk off
Gov. George W. Bush's face in time for his big moment in
Philadelphia? But we found a number of expert speechwriters, image
makers and commentators willing and even eager to provide Gore with
a few suggestions gratis. Perhaps they are like surgeons happy to
be called in on a difficult case. It's also possible that the
Republicans want to see Gore fail and the Democrats want to be able
to say ``I told you so'' if he does. At any rate, here is a sampler
of their advice:
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Spencer, who was President Ronald Reagan's campaign
strategist, believes Gore's team ``ought to calm him down a
little.'' He explains: ``The first thing is not to run out to the
podium like a kid at a high school basketball game. Don't high-five
everybody. I laugh every time I see it. He skips, hops and jumps
through the crowd. It's outrageously unpresidential.''
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Sorensen, who was President John F. Kennedy's primary
speechwriter, offers a more succinct recipe. ``He must sound not
like he's programmed, not like he's a politician, and not like he's
a professor but like a president,'' Sorensen advised.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Rafshoon, who was President Jimmy Carter's image maker,
believes in sobriety and separation. ``He needs to give a very
substantive speech, and he needs to just talk about what he's going
to do as president and not even mention the last eight years,''
Rafshoon offered. ``Clinton didn't do him a bit of good the other
night. All he did was, he made a good case for Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafshoon and Bill Carrick, a Democratic strategist, agree that
it is time to ignore the advisers. ``At this point, you just do
what's in your gut,'' Carrick said. ``It's a great moment. There
are 40,000 people prepared to love him. All the armchair
quarterbacks, forget them all.''
</P>
<P>
   There are widely varying views on the notorious stiffness
problem. Our New York Times colleague William Safire, who once
wrote speeches for the notably unlimber Richard Nixon, suggests
that Gore could surprise people with a lighter touch. He recalled
that the vice president demonstrated at this year's Gridiron dinner
in Washington that he does a good job with self-deprecating humor.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer, however, views humor as hazardous. ``You should never
try jokes if you aren't very good at it,'' he warns.
</P>
<P>
   And finally Bill Maher, the host of television's ``Politically
Incorrect,'' made this last-minute plea: ``Al Gore should examine
the backgrounds of the delegates at the Democratic convention, and
after realizing that they all have at least fourth-grade
educations, not talk to them as if they don't.''

IRS FALLS DOWN ON SERVICE TO SMALL BUSINESSES, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Small businesses, farmers and the self-employed pay
44 percent of all taxes the federal government collects. But a new
report says they seem to have the most difficult time deciphering
the tax code and paying what they owe.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office found that the IRS spends much
more time trying to correct problems than trying to avoid them and
that many small-business operators find tax time frustrating and
confusing.
</P>
<P>
   ``IRS has not operated in a way that best enables it to serve
small business,'' said the study, which was requested by Sen. Kit
Bond, a Missouri Republican and chairman of the Senate Committee on
Small Business.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS says that it is aware of small-business complaints and
that numerous changes are being made to make the department more
taxpayer-friendly, as ordered by Congress in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti said steps to improve service
include simplifying forms and publications, eliminating
instructions that only apply to large businesses, setting up
special call-in sites for assistance, and providing ``clear, plain
English'' answers to taxpayer questions on Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Bond has held hearings on problems that small businesses have
with the IRS. Bond said the report, which includes a survey of
1,000 businesses nationwide and interviews with IRS officials,
``confirms what small-business owners have been telling us for
years _ the tax code is just too difficult for most people to
understand, and the IRS has not operated in a way to serve small
business effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report said the IRS acknowledged that small businesses
are more likely than other taxpayers to have compliance problems,
mainly because of tax laws that involve several layers of filing,
reporting and deposit requirements.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing last year, Brian Gloe of Rosse Lithographing in
Kansas City testified that his company has to file more than 180
IRS forms annually, including some forms to merely verify the
filing of other forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small businesses may not always have the kind of resources
needed to deal with those complexities,'' the report said. It found
that 94 percent of small businesses, defined as having less than $5
million in assets, hire professional tax preparers.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS focus is on correcting problems instead of preventing
them, the report said. According to the IRS, 11 percent of its
budget is for customer assistance to avoid problems, 72 percent is
spent on compliance and 17 percent is for processing returns and
adjusting taxpayer accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that encounter compliance problems and a backlog of
taxes may end up having to go out of business, the GAO report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, by the time IRS determines that a small
business has a compliance problem and sets out to correct the
problem, it may be too late,'' the report said.

 &HT;    LIEBERMAN CELEBRATES TICKET AS GORE IS NOMINATED
 &HT;    Eds: Inserts Jones, DeBarry quotes; minor editing throughout.
 &HT;    770&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vice President Al Gore claimed the Democratic
Party's presidential nomination Wednesday night in a historic
roll-call vote that also made Sen. Joseph Lieberman the first Jew
nominated as vice president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is America a great country or what?'' Lieberman said in
accepting the No. 2 spot on the ticket. ``Only in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman arrived on the podium to the musical theme from
``Chariots of Fire,'' the Academy Award-winning movie about the
1924 British Olympic track team led by Harold Abrahams, a Jewish
sprinter.
</P>
<P>
   Paying homage to his parents and blue-collar upbringing in
Connecticut, Lieberman spoke of ``the importance of work and
responsibility,'' key elements of the centrist ``New Democrat''
movement in which both Gore and Lieberman are rooted.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman also invoked the legacy of John F. Kennedy with
words that acknowledged his own historic role in American politics
and sought to assure restless liberals that the centrist ticket is
well versed in the traditions of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the next frontier isn't just in front of us,
but inside of us _ to overcome the differences that are still
between us, to break down the barriers that remain, and to help
every American claim the limitless possibilities of our own
lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, a hero of the civil rights movement
in the 1960s, strove in his nomination speech to put to rest any
doubts about Lieberman. Recalling Lieberman's involvement in voting
rights drives in the once-segregated South, he called the senator
``my brother.''
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut senator was introduced to the convention
delegates by his wife, Hadassah, the child of Holocaust victims.
She described Lieberman as a man whose sense of community ``reminds
him to embrace our nation's diversity and celebrate our
differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's choice of Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew with the reputation
as ``the conscience of the Senate,'' was widely viewed as an
attempt to further distance the vice president from the scandals of
the Clinton presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's acceptance speech did little to suggest otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Al Gore for 15 years,'' Lieberman said. ``I know
his record and I know his heart. I know him as a public servant and
I know what it is like to sit with him around the dining room
table. We have discussed _ sometimes even debated _ policy issues.
And we have shared private moments of prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a Southern Baptist and former Vanderbilt University
seminarian, arrived in Los Angeles hours before the roll-call vote
of the states that formally gave him the presidential nomination he
had sought for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president will accept the nomination Thursday night
with a speech that looms as the most important address of his
24-year career in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his arrival at the Burbank airport Wednesday, Gore said his
acceptance speech would make clear ``the big choices'' American
voters will face in this year's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``You deserve to know exactly what the candidates are proposing
to do so you can make an informed judgment,'' Gore said. ``I'm
going to tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, who continues to trail Republican nominee George W.
Bush in public opinion polls, also faces the challenge of
presenting himself as a more appealing figure.
</P>
<P>
   That process began Wednesday with a series of nominating
speeches that was designed to introduce the American TV viewing
audience beyond the Staples Center convention hall to ``Al Gore,
the principled fighter,'' as the producers billed the third night
of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the people who know Gore best delivered the nominating
speeches: actor Tommy Lee Jones, Gore's roommate at Harvard; Lois
DeBerry, a state legislator in Gore's home state of Tennessee; and
Karenna Gore Schiff, Gore's oldest child and the mother of his
1-year-old grandson, Wyatt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad is a man of faith in the most gutsy, practical sense,''
said Schiff. ``He wants to see goodness prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiff, who has emerged as one of the vice president's most
important advisers with a talent of her own for politics, added:
``I'm not asking you to support Al Gore because he is my father,
even because he's been a great dad for his kids. What really
matters is what he will do for all our kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore joined his daughter in an unannounced visit to the podium
following her address. The two embraced and waved to the cheering,
sign-waving delegates before departing.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Jones painted an affectionate and very human picture of Gore,
calling him ``the closest thing I've had to a brother.''
</P>
<P>
   He reminisced about his college-year visits to the Gore home in
Carthage, Tenn., where they spent time ``catching a loose cow,
going canoeing and hunting, and chasing through the woods with coon
dogs in the middle of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jones also shared how Gore ``struggled to hold on to this
faith'' following the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy and the
U.S. involvement in Vietnam, only to emerge as someone who ``has
the brains _ and the heart _ to change the whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman set the stage for Gore's speech with his own critique
of the Republican ticket that was nominated in Philadelphia, citing
the poor standing of Texas in providing health care and in
preventing air and water pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two weeks ago, our Republican friends tried to walk and talk a
lot like us,'' he said. ``But let's be honest: we may be near
Hollywood, but not since Tom Hanks won an Oscar has there been that
much acting in Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said, ``I'm glad the GOP has changed their rhetoric,
but I wish they would also change their policies,'' he said. ``As
my friend John McCain might say, let me do some straight talking
about their record.''
</P>
<P>
   He singled out the GOP's education policies, suggesting that a
Republican administration would not provide adequate financial
resources to modernize the public school system. ``To me, it seems
like their idea of school modernization means buying a new calendar
for every building,'' he said.

GOOD SERVICE SHOULD BE THE RULE, NOT THE EXCEPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no excuse for going back. I gave into ``convenience''
and kept dropping in. But this time I mean it. I'm not patronizing
that office supply store again.
</P>
<P>
   In several visits over the years (I know, I know, what took so
long?) I have encountered nothing that remotely resembles customer
service:
</P>
<P>
   The cashier who maintained a personal phone conversation with a
family member while scanning my purchases and taking my money. She
neither looked up nor spoke to me.
</P>
<P>
   The employee who pointed to the back of the store and said the
item might be on aisle 9. I found it on aisle 7.
</P>
<P>
   The employee who said he was new, didn't know the answer and
walked away. I assumed he went to ask someone. After a few minutes,
it was clear he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The two workers who held an animated gripe session about their
shift schedules while three customers waited at the counter.
</P>
<P>
   The item that was on a sale table but scanned at a higher price
at the register. The cashier said the computer price ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The trash barrel that overflowed at the front door.
</P>
<P>
   That's it. Finally, absolutely, I'm done with the place.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't just seen one person having a bad day. I've
encountered a succession of badly trained, poorly supervised people
who clearly don't want to be there and don't have a natural
customer service bone in their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, when I have on occasion written columns
endorsing better customer service by front-line workers, some
readers have responded that I'm an idiot.
</P>
<P>
   I shouldn't expect any better, they say. After all, these are
entry-level employees who aren't paid enough to put out the extra
effort. Their employers don't deserve any more.
</P>
<P>
   Poppycock.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody who draws a paycheck anywhere has entered into a
contract. A paycheck isn't a gift for just showing up, although
that certainly helps. A paycheck is given partly for helping to
fulfill the organization's goal: to meet customer needs and
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Too many unmet customer expectations eventually translate into
too few customers and a ``Going Out of Business'' sign on the door.
</P>
<P>
   The burden rests partly on management to hire decent people,
train them and supervise them properly. It also falls on the
individual worker to exercise initiative, sensible judgment and
good intentions.

<P>
   This isn't some ``the customer is always right'' diatribe.
Sometimes the customer is dead wrong. Many a worker has the horror
stories to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   But most customers don't march in to inflict pain and suffering
on diligent worker bees. Most customers need something and want a
smooth transaction.
</P>
<P>
   It'd help a whole lot of people a whole bunch if ``It's not my
job,'' ``I don't know,'' ``It's not our policy,'' ``I'm new and
they haven't told me yet,'' ``It's not my department'' and ``I
wasn't here when that happened'' disappeared from workplace
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   It'd help a whole lot of people _ patrons and purveyors _ if
more time were spent searching for satisfactory solutions than
ignoring or griping about the way things are.

NAIA SUGGESTS PERKS IT WANTS TO RELOCATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRAD COOPER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Auto leases and country club membership fees
are some of the items the NAIA is shopping for from 39 communities,
including Olathe, Kan., trying to draw the sports organization away
from Tulsa, Okla., records show.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics is
considering another relocation eight years after it abruptly
decided to leave Kansas City. The association had been in Kansas
City 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   The NAIA sent 39 cities a ``request for proposal'' that outlined
areas the cities should address in their proposals to the group.
Kansas City was not among the cities.
</P>
<P>
   Among the suggested inducements were auto leases for two staff
members and country club initiation fees for at least three
staffers. Country club initiation fees can range between $4,000 and
$40,000, depending on the kind of membership.
</P>
<P>
   The NAIA also wants cities to address whether they would provide
a relocation package, including moving expenses, moving assistance
for staff, and job search and placement for the spouses of
organization staffers, according to the document.
</P>
<P>
   The organization also wants each community to indicate its
financial commitment to the NAIA project. Such a commitment could
include land, cash or the donation of products and services from
any source.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carr, managing director and general counsel for the NAIA,
said the organization was not looking for a government handout.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really is looked at as a proposal that would come from
the public and the private sector,'' Carr said. ``We definitely
don't expect a city or a county to just write us a check out of
their funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Rolnick, director of research for the Federal Reserve
Bank in Minneapolis, has spent nine years researching and writing
about economic incentives given to businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In his research, Rolnick said, he hadn't seen a case where a
government gave a business an amenity like an auto lease or golf
club membership to relocate.
</P>
<P>
   The NAIA's request for proposal was obtained by /{The Kansas
City Star/} from the city of Olathe under the Kansas Open Records
Act.
</P>
<P>
   Whether city taxpayers or the private sector would pay for the
expenses was left to each community to decide. What was clear from
the proposal was that the NAIA wanted help from the community to
relocate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NAIA is asking for a great deal of support from our new
partner,'' the proposal states. ``The NAIA is pursuing a joint
effort to raise the capital necessary to secure land and build the
new facility for the NAIA and the community.''
</P>
<P>
   The NAIA, an organization made up of 331 mostly small colleges,
caught Kansas City leaders off guard in September 1992 when its
council of presidents voted unanimously to move to Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   But now it's time to put the past behind, said Kevin Gray,
president of the Greater Kansas City Sports Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it (the NAIA's possible move from Tulsa) tells you is
that the grass isn't always greener on the other side,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The organization is looking for a site that is between 14 and 15
acres to accommodate a complex between 62,000 and 79,000 square
feet.
</P>
<P>
   The NAIA said it was looking for a new site because it was
adding new programs that required more space. Tulsa is a candidate
for the new headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities that have expressed interest include Branson;
Lexington, Ky.; St. Louis; Orlando, Fla.; Buffalo, N.Y.; Cleveland;
and Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   Cities have until Wednesday to submit proposals. The NAIA will
pare that list to five by Sept. 7, and a final decision is expected
by mid-January. A move could occur as early as July 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Carr of the NAIA said the group was only suggesting some items
that each community could provide. That did not necessarily mean
those were requirements for attracting the organization, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the country club fees, Carr said the organization
conducted a lot of business on the golf course, including the
wooing of corporate sponsors. He said it was an incentive that
could be provided by the private sector without much cost to the
community at large.
</P>
<P>
   Carr said the auto leases were another way a community could
contribute without incurring significant costs. When the NAIA moved
to Tulsa from Kansas City in 1993, Carr said, two local car
dealerships in Tulsa were active with the local sports commission
and chamber of commerce, and the dealerships agreed to provide
cars.
</P>
<P>
   NAIA officials said the organization's headquarters would
benefit the community. They said the organization had injected an
estimated $69.9 million into the Tulsa economy since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Tim McKee, vice president of economic development for the Olathe
Chamber of Commerce, said he did not foresee any taxpayer subsidies
being used to draw the NAIA to Olathe. McKee said the chamber had
been trying to bring the private sector together to support the
city's bid.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Olathe chamber probably would pitch two or three
sites for the NAIA to consider. One that has been mentioned is at
Renner Road and 119th Street. The City Council is considering a
plan to offer tax breaks to develop three corners of that
intersection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously would like them to come to town,'' McKee said.
``They bring a lot to the entire metro area.''

LIEBERMAN SETS STAGE FOR GORE AS DEMOCRATS NOMINATE TICKET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout; sub byline) (Eds: 2nd take will move in 10 minutes.) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sen. Joseph Lieberman introduced himself to the
American voter on Wednesday night on prime-time television with a
forceful appeal on behalf of his old friend Al Gore and a muted
attack on the Republican nominee, George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, whose selection as Gore's running mate made him the
first Orthodox Jew on a major party ticket, offered a personal
testament to the vice president by saying they were so close that
they prayed together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Al Gore for 15 years,'' Lieberman said in his
prepared text. ``I know his record and I know his heart. I know him
as a public servant and I know what it is like to sit with him
around the dining room table. We have discussed, sometimes even
debated, policy issues. And we have shared private moments of
prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Making his case for the Democratic ticket _ and one against the
Republicans _ on the night he and Gore were to be formally
nominated, Lieberman said flatly, ``It's this simple: We Democrats
will expand the prosperity. They will squander it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's address was one of the most anticipated, and
consequential, moments of the four-night convention. The Gore
campaign has counted on the Connecticut senator to electrify the
ticket of a standard bearer who has struggled to galvanize even
loyal Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for all the interest in Lieberman is that he is
virtually unknown beyond his home state. Though he has been a
senator for 12 years, Lieberman, who is 58, is not nearly as tested
on the national stage as Gov. George W. Bush's running mate, Dick
Cheney, who had served as a congressman, White House chief of staff
and secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman also took a shot a the Republicans who gathered in
Philadelphia two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Republican friends tried to walk and talk a lot like us,''
he said. ``But let's be honest. We may be near Hollywood. But not
since Tom Hanks won an Oscar has there been that much acting in
Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the largely glowing reception Lieberman has drawn, his
selection has unsettled some liberal Democrats because of his
centrist stands. On Tuesday, he met with black delegates to
reassure them that he supported affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Wednesday night, he sought to establish his
credentials as champion for minorities. ``In the early 1960s, when
I was a college student, I walked with Martin Luther King in the
march on Washington,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who had not been widely viewed by most Democrats as a
likely choice for Gore _ and was plucked out of obscurity only
eight days ago _ still seems a bit fazed by his newfound celebrity
and, perhaps, that Gore dared to pick a Jew. As he put it in his
opening line, ``Is America a great country or what?''

JOHNSON GIVES INFIELDERS REST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The offense is dreadful, the losses are mounting, so Los
Angeles Dodgers manager Davey Johnson went away from the norm and
rested three of the regular infielders. Only shortstop Alex Cora,
who platoons with Kevin Elster, started Wednesday's series finale
against the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Eric Karros, second baseman Mark Grudzielanek and
third baseman Adrian Beltre each rested while Jim Leyritz and F.P.
Santangelo each started for the first time in more than a month. It
gives the trio two days off because of today's off day. Dave Hansen
started in place of Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I can take a step back and refocus and come back Friday,''
said Grudzielanek, who is 3 for 20 on the road trip and also made
two defensive miscues in Tuesday's loss. ``I think there should
have been more of this throughout the year, giving guys days off.
It's important, even for guys like Sheff (Gary Sheffield) and
(Shawn) Green.''
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek, who missed nearly two weeks last month with an
illness, had appeared in 108 of the first 118 games and Karros had
appeared in 114 games. Sheffield played in his 116th game against
the Marlins and Green has played in every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just to give a little bit of a rest,'' Johnson said.
``Give some other guys a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, Santangelo made his first start since July 13,
though he missed time while on the disabled list and while serving
a five-game suspension. Leyritz's start at first was his first
since joining the Dodgers in late July. He started two games at
catcher, the last being July 9.
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo is hoping that getting a couple of at-bats back to
back can trigger something. Santangelo has had a disappointing and
frustrating season, but he said his recent rehab appearance at
Single-A San Bernardino might have triggered a memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got back into my old stance that I had in Montreal,'' said
Santangelo, who belted his first career pinch-hit homer Tuesday.
``That's the way I was swinging on the rehab assignment. The night
before (a pop-out), it was my first at-bat in 14 days. The hitting
coach there, Jack Clark, asked me why I was spread out and I said I
didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort in rhythm: Right-hander Darren Dreifort has won six
straight, has a 2.33 ERA since the All-Star break, and yet keeps
getting pushed back in the rotation as the Dodgers try to protect
him against arm weariness the last six weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about that,'' Dreifort said. ``Why worry about
it? You don't control it.''
</P>
<P>
   But what Dreifort does care about is how he's thrown since the
All-Star break. He's won a career-high six straight decisions, and
has been the Dodgers' best pitcher over the past month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all starts with the rhythm,'' said Dreifort, who is 10-7
with a 4.35 ERA. ``Once you feel like you're in rhythm, your
mechanics should all into place. You still get out of it from time
to time, but maybe I recognize quicker what I'm doing and can back
into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds ands ends: Catcher Todd Hundley said his sore right knee,
which kept him from starting Tuesday, felt much better and he
should be able to start Friday. ... With right-hander Chan Ho Park
missing his start with flu-like symptoms, the Dodgers altered their
pitching rotation. Kevin Brown will pitch Friday, Park will go
Saturday, if healthy, and Dreifort will throw Sunday. If Park is
ailing late in the week, Dreifort would be moved up to Saturday.

SPARKS BRACE FOR COMETS' BIG THREE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Is the Los Angeles Sparks' balance and bench enough to
overcome the Houston Comets' Big Three in a best-of-three series?
</P>
<P>
   That's a question the WNBA Western Conference Finals will reveal
as the league's top teams prepare for today's 6 p.m. opener at
Compaq Center, where a near capacity crowd is expected.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks hope to do what no other team's been able to
accomplish the last three years eliminate the Comets in the
playoffs while the three-time defending champions find themselves
in the unfamiliar position as underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a coach's point of view, I like being the underdog,''
Houston coach Van Chancellor said. ``It takes away the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case every year, the Comets rely on their Big
Three - Sheryl Swoopes, the Defensive Player of the Year and league
scoring leader , Cynthia Cooper, a two-time most valuable player
from USC, and Tina Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Sparks have been the aggressors this year, winning
all three games against the Comets.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. played extremely well all three times,'' Chancellor said.
``They're just so hard to defend. They have a deep bench. They can
score.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Cooper pointed out Wednesday, the Sparks ``beat us three
times under three different circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   All three Comets stars were healthy in the first meeting, which
the Sparks won 90-84 while getting all five starters scoring in
double figures. Lisa Leslie and Mwadi Mabika each had 21 to lead
the way.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper had a severe ankle sprain and did not suit up for the
Sparks' 83-58 victory on July 14. Outside of Swoopes' 26 points and
Thompson's 17, the Comets got only 15 points from the rest of the
team.
</P>
<P>
   Then on July 29, the Sparks' snapped their losing streak in the
Compaq Center at eight games with a 84-74 victory. Swoopes played
with a dislocated index finger and finished with season-low eight
points. The Sparks starters - Leslie, Mabika, DeLisha Milton,
Tamecka Dixon and Ukari Figgs - played the entire second half.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks coach Michael Cooper said ``good hard-nosed defense''
keyed all three victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a pretty good team full-court, we were able to take away
their 3-point attempts,'' he said. ``I think that's vital for this
team because I think that is part of their offense is that they
have to get off between eight and 16 3-point attempts a game to
open the rest of their game. We've been able to do that, plus we
have the lateral quickness where we can at least defend them on the
run.''
</P>
<P>
   In the three games, the Comets shot 18 percent from beyond the
arc, a big drop from their overall effort of 35 percent for the
season. On the other hand, the Sparks have been active from long
distance against the Comets, shooting 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks rebounded better (96 to 83), distributed the ball
more efficiently (25 to 16 assists), and had more steals (25 to 16)
than Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think with L.A. what makes them so good and so strong, you
can't just come out and focus on one particular player,'' Swoopes
said. ``They have five players on the floor and all of them are
capable of scoring.''

LOS ANGELES: or what? '' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before the program opened, Gore arrived here triumphantly,
stepping off Air Force Two for a rally at the Burbank airport with
Lieberman and their families. Only one day after President Clinton
embraced Gore in Monroe, Mich., as the inheritor of his political
legacy, the vice president moved to strike out on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every generation, we have to make the hard choices between
one direction or another, between going back to the past or forward
to the future,'' Gore declared. ``Let others argue the case for the
old guard. We're the new guard, and we're going to bring positive
change to the United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if manufactured, the suspense Wednesday was inside the
Staples Center, where more than 4,000 delegates converged for the
ritualistic, but joyous, roll call of states to officially award
Gore his party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore claimed enough delegates to put him over the top five
months ago, this remained a night of triumph _ and, at long last,
emergence _ for Gore. He represented Tennessee in the House for
nine years and the Senate for eight years, but has been best known
for his eight years of faithful service to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As did Cheney in Philadelphia two weeks ago, Lieberman used his
night in the spotlight to critique the opposition. He scolded
Republicans for putting forth what he portrayed as a misleading
festival of inclusion at its convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad the GOP has changed their rhetoric,'' he said, ``but
I wish they would also change their policies. As my friend John
McCain might say, let me do some straight talking about their
record.''
</P>
<P>
   In the excerpts of his speech, Lieberman's taunts at the
Republicans were far more subtle than Cheney's had been against the
Democrats, signaling that Lieberman may not be as willing to play
the traditional running-mate role of attack dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing that our opponent talks about education,''
Lieberman said. ``Schools need to be held to the highest standards
of performance and accountability. But I'm sad to say their plan
does not provide the resources our schools need to meet those high
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I've read their plan. To me, it seems like their
idea of school modernization means buying a new calendar for every
building.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Gore's often grueling primary race against Bill Bradley
and his high-profile assignments from Clinton, like running a
program to streamline the federal government, the vice president
remains something of a mystery to the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   It has become almost a cliche for people to describe Gore as
remote and hard to warm to. But Karenna Gore Schiff, Gore's eldest
daughter and one of his closest political advisers, sought to alter
that perception by describing a warm-hearted, conscientious Al Gore
that the public does not know.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my dad was a congressman, he listed our number in the
phone book in Carthage so the people he worked for could always
reach him,'' Schiff said in the prepared text of her speech
seconding Gore's nomination. ``During my summers on the farm, I
would answer the phone, and it would often be a constituent who
needed help getting his veterans' benefits, or finding the right
health care. I was taught to run _ not walk _ to get my dad so that
people wouldn't be kept waiting for a moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiff, who is 27, also spoke lovingly of her father. ``One time
he came home after a long day of hearings and meetings and votes
and found me struggling to begin that all-important elementary
school assignment: the dinosaur diorama,'' she recalled. ``He was
tired, but while my mom was getting the others to brush their teeth
and get in bed, my dad was the one who took me down to the store to
get the emergency Q-Tips, colored Play-Doh, and construction paper
because he was simply being a dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House Democratic leader whom Gore had
considered as his running mate, also spoke to the personal side of
Gore. ``Al Gore is a good man,'' he said. ``He is a decent, caring
man. He listens to his heart and his head. He loves his family. He
loves this country. He could be the best president this country
will ever have.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rubin, who was a treasury secretary under Clinton,
saluted Gore for his help in ensuring a vibrant economy. ``I worked
with Al Gore for six and a half years,'' he said. ``And he was a
powerful and effective force in all of the major economic policy
decisions that contributed so critically to this record. I was
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman also took some time to tell his personal story to the
American public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I try to see this world as my dad saw it from his
bakery truck,'' he said. ``About this time, he'd be getting ready
for the all-night run. I know that somewhere in America right now,
there is another father loading a bakery truck, or a young woman
programming a computer, or a parent dreaming of a better future for
their daughter or son.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can keep the faith,'' he went on, ``then 40 years from
now one of their children will stand before a gathering like this
with a chance to serve and lead this country that we love.''
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, at least, Lieberman brought the Democrats a
wave of favorable publicity in the days leading to the convention.
By turning to Lieberman, the first Democratic senator to
aggressively repudiate Clinton for his affair with a White House
intern, Gore underscored his determination to shed the president's
shadow.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews in the convention hall Wednesday, more than 20
delegates, one after another, said they had not known much about
Lieberman until last week. But many said they were impressed, even
thrilled, as they learned more about him.
</P>
<P>
   Eufaula Frazier, a delegate from Florida who is black, said she
also could relate to the historic nature of the Lieberman
selection. ``Forty years ago I was a beautician and we were all in
the shop watching the TV, so excited we were about Kennedy being
nominated,'' she said. ``The supply man came in and said it was
incredible, a Catholic in such a position. He said maybe one day it
will be a Jew. It is coming true tonight, and I get to be a part of
it.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Jay Fisk has been selling souvenirs in Los Angeles
for 28 years, but the four days of the Democratic National
Convention has proved a lot harder work than a Lakers or Kings
game.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk and other Staples Center vendors say the convention has
been good for business; he can't keep ``Gore 2000'' T-shirts in
stock and is hoping to receive another shipment before the
convention ends Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Convention officials expect each of the five kiosks inside
Staples Center to sell $40,000 a day in merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything with Joe Lieberman on it is popular,'' said Fisk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 seller is the Leadership for the New Millennium
button,'' said Fisk. ``The button is popular because both
candidates are on it. They love buying the ones with both of them
on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the support for their party's historic ticket and the
hopes that their candidates will win in November, continuing the
Democratic presence in the White House after eight years of Bill
Clinton's rule.
</P>
<P>
   At stalls throughout Staples Center, Democrats can buy buttons,
hats, T-shirts, bumper stickers, coffee mugs, golf balls, and a
host of other political paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Gills, a member of the California delegation from Santa
Clarita, spent almost $60 on T-shirts that read: ``America 2000 The
Democratic National Convention,'' with a picture of California and
the American Flag.
</P>
<P>
   Other delegates paid $27 for Hillary for U.S. Senate T-shirts
and $15 for Hillary hats or Gore 2000 mugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I purchased a number of souvenirs, including several buttons,
to commemorate being here,'' said Gillis, a regional director for
the California Democratic Party. ``Conventions are historic
moments.''
</P>
<P>
   One popular bumper sticker read: ``Take back the House. Vote
Democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   Also being offered to Democrats wanting to relive the 1960
Democratic Convention at the Los Angeles Sports Arena were buttons
telling the party faithful that ``The Tradition Lives On!'' a
reference between former President John F. Kennedy and Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Hake, author of ``The Guide to Presidential Campaign
Collectibles,'' and co-host of QVC's convention show, said buttons
and other memorabilia help tell the story of the whole election.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the trends I've noticed is that people seem to be
collecting memorabilia from the elections they've lived through and
voted in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clintons have proved to be very popular,'' added Hake.
``The anti-Clinton buttons sell just as well or better than the
pro-Clinton buttons.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Rose, vice president of merchandising for West Chester,
Pa.,-based QVC, said that just as in Philadelphia with the GOP, the
television shopping network is the official retailer at the
Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   Rose said the audience who watched their hour-long program
Wednesday night was a ``buying audience'' _ not quite the same
audience C-SPAN would attract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We offer our viewers the kind of merchandise that would only
be available if they were here,'' said Rose. ``The appeal is that
as much as they would want to be there, they can't.''

OFFENSE WINS THE DAY

<P>
   COSTA MESA, Calif. _ Depending on your point of view, USC's
scrimmage at Orange Coast College on Wednesday was either a sign of
encouragement or cause f or alarm.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans' running game certainly took a step forward, as
tailback Sul tan McCullough rushed for 154 yards in 21 carries and
scored two touchdo wns. But those stats also raise alarms about how
USC's defense will stop Penn State's running game in the
season-opener Aug. 27. Remember, the d efense is supposed to be
USC's strength.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly gave USC coach Paul Hackett a reason for pause,
after his l ongest scrimmage ever (3{ hours, 126 plays). With the
team assembled for a post-game talk, Hackett screamed about how
``conditioning'' and `` running the ball'' would determine the
winner in the Kickoff Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this game will be about the running game,'' Hackett
said. ``It 's a tribute to the offense what they did today, but the
defense has to stop the run.''
</P>
<P>
   True freshman Chris Howard had 82 yards in eight carries,
including a 67 -yard touchdown run to end the scrimmage. Tailback
Malaefou MacKenzie la sted just one play, cutting his hand on a
helmet and needed stitches. He is expected to be OK.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Antoine Harris re-injured his hamstring, and Hackett
said he w ould only be a part-time player for the Kickoff Classic,
with either Ale x Holmes of Harvard-Westlake or Doyal Butler
replacing him.
</P>
<P>
   The play of the day came from wide receiver Kareem Kelly (two
receptions , 76 yards), who caught an 18-yard touchdown pass from
Carson Palmer (11 -18, 128 yards, one touchdown, one intt2jCPtion)
by tippingwagll ove r cornerback Darrell Rideaux, and then catching
it in mid-air.
</P>
<P>
   Junior David Newbury made three of four field goals is expected
to be an nounced as the starting placekicker today.
</P>
<P>
   Position changes: Linebackers John Cousins and A.J. Single h ave
been moved to defensive end. As previously reported, freshman
defens ive end Malcolm Wooldridge (6-2, 280) arrived Tuesday night
and officially joined the team.

FOR NEWS AGENCIES, POLITICAL CONVENTION'S `NO NEWS' ISN'T `GOOD
NEWS'
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: SUBS for updating, rewriting thruout)  
 By RICK LYMAN  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ By the late afternoon Wednesday, most of the major
World Wide Web news sites were no longer able to resist struggle
for life unfolding at the bottom of the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   While cable-news channels continued to feature drama-free images
from the Democratic National Convention, on the Internet the news
about the submarine had taken the lead position on the CBS, MSNBC,
Fox News and CNN Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``No Signs of Life'' was the Fox site's headline.
</P>
<P>
   Of the major network sites, only ABC continued to cling to the
convention as its news lead, offering the insight that, yes, now is
time for Vice President Al Gore and Sen. Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut to introduce themselves to the American people. As John
Tyson, one of the vice president's college roommates, described it
to MSNBC Wednesday night, the final two days of the convention will
provide ``a good strong dose of Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the theme emphasized on every single one of the Web
sites and by the cable anchors. Most often, it quickly led to the
unanswerable question of whether Gore would be able to rise to the
occasion and make himself appear sufficiently presidential to
improve his poll numbers. Bring on the pundits!
</P>
<P>
   By evening, some of the sites (Fox and CBS) had finally come
around to leading with their own Lieberman pieces. But the general
lack of drama in Los Angeles was perhaps best exemplified by CNN's
extensive coverage of the arrival of Gore's jet at Burbank Airport.
For what seemed like hours, Air Force Two taxied down the runway
and then sat on the tarmac, the camera focused on the dark, gaping
doorway, waiting for someone, anyone, to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks of trying to watch first the Republican and then the
Democratic national conventions by flipping back and forth between
cable and broadcast channels and surfing the Web have shown how the
widely lamented absence of news at the conventions has often led
news organizations to a near-crippling dependency on commentary to
fill the dead air.
</P>
<P>
   When news actually did break, like the clash between the police
and protesters on Monday night outside the convention hall, the
tendency of most of the channels was to show a few quick images and
then to ask the commentators, who had no idea what was actually
happening, what they thought the clash meant.
</P>
<P>
   The Web, while promising a greater degree of immediacy and
immersion for convention junkies, most often turned out to be
little more than electronic journals, closer to what might be found
in a weekly magazine than on a live television report. Many sites
tried to make their points by adding little games and puzzles and
quizzes _ and some of these were actually not half bad.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC, for instance, had something called Electoral Chess in
which an Internet user could predict which states each presidential
candidate might win in November and see if it would be enough to
get their candidate the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy Now had a protesters' version of Monopoly in which
users were offered the chance to ``buy a politician today!''
</P>
<P>
   Donors offering hefty contributions were greeted with messages
like: ``Welcome to the White House. Thank you for your donations.
You may drop by anytime you want!''
</P>
<P>
   David Carr, writing on Inside.com, had fun predicting how the
major news outlets would cover the Democratic convention, day by
day. Thursday's reports, he predicted, would center on the vice
president's efforts to finish writing his acceptance speech.
``Every one of the major papers in America will buy into the
transparent canard that Gore _ a man who does push-polling on his
choice of neckwear _ is working the speech all by his lonesome,
revising draft after draft deep into the night,'' Carr wrote.
</P>
<P>
   And the chats continued. ABC's Sam Donaldson, who has taken to
the Web with an eager-beaverness second to none, has chatted
incessantly every night of both conventions. When his guest Harry
Thomason, the Hollywood producer and pal of President Clinton,
asked Donaldson how many people were actually out there listening
to them jabber, Donaldson had to admit that he didn't really know,
but it was far, far fewer than were watching the networks. It
didn't matter, though, Donaldson said. ``We are the acorn and from
this acorn will grow a mighty oak,'' he said.

BILL BRADLEY IS ASKED TO HEAD U.S. OLYMPIC COMMITTEE 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five months after dropping out of the race for the U.S.
presidency, Bill Bradley has been asked if he wants to be chairman
of the U.S. Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Norm Blake, the USOC's chief executive, said Wednesday that he
had spoken by telephone with Bradley, the former New Jersey
senator, three or four weeks ago at the request of the
organization's nominating committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was seriously considering it, and I was very
impressed with how he conducted himself,'' Blake said. ``He wanted
to be sure it wasn't a figurehead position, and wanted a job where
he could make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a former New York Knicks player, gave no decision and
Blake was awaiting Bradley's response to a tentative date for a
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who spoke Tuesday night at the Democratic National
Convention, played for the 1964 U.S. Olympic basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   Anita Dunn, a spokeswoman for Bradley, said, ``He is considering
a number of options, but he's not commenting on any specific
conversations that he's having with anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The USOC's nominating committee is expected to recommend a slate
of officers, including chairman, by Sept. 1. The USOC's board of
directors will vote in December.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his direct contact with Bradley, Blake said, ``I will
embrace whomever the nominating committee recommends.''
</P>
<P>
   The USOC reorganized last year under a corporate model by
creating a more powerful CEO position out of the former executive
director's job, and turning the formerly volunteer president's job,
now held by Bill Hybl, into the chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman, who is not paid, would have broad international
responsibilities and a significant role in Washington. Steve
Richards, chief of the nominating committee, confirmed that ``as
part of the process of looking at a variety of candidates,''
Bradley was contacted.
</P>
<P>
   Richard declined to say whether Bradley was the only outsider
being considered for chairman. Paul George and Sandy Baldwin, two
USOC vice presidents, are being considered. Also, Sandy Knapp, of
USA Gymnastics, said Wednesday, ``I'm in the candidate pool.''

LIEBERMAN SETS STAGE FOR GORE AS DEMOCRATS NOMINATE TICKET

 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sen. Joseph Lieberman introduced himself to the
American voter on Wednesday night on prime-time television with a
forceful appeal on behalf of his old friend Al Gore and a muted
attack on the Republican nominee, George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, whose selection as Gore's running mate made him the
first Orthodox Jew on a major party ticket, offered a personal
testament to the vice president by saying they were so close that
they prayed together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Al Gore for 15 years,'' Lieberman said in his
prepared text. ``I know his record and I know his heart. I know him
as a public servant and I know what it is like to sit with him
around the dining room table. We have discussed, sometimes even
debated, policy issues. And we have shared private moments of
prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Making his case for the Democratic ticket _ and one against the
Republicans _ on the night he and Gore were to be formally
nominated, Lieberman said flatly, ``It's this simple: We Democrats
will expand the prosperity. They will squander it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's address was one of the most anticipated, and
consequential, moments of the four-night convention. The Gore
campaign has counted on the Connecticut senator to electrify the
ticket of a standard bearer who has struggled to galvanize even
loyal Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for all the interest in Lieberman is that he is
virtually unknown beyond his home state. Though he has been a
senator for 12 years, Lieberman, who is 58, is not nearly as tested
on the national stage as Gov. George W. Bush's running mate, Dick
Cheney, who had served as a congressman, White House chief of staff
and secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman also took a shot a the Republicans who gathered in
Philadelphia two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Republican friends tried to walk and talk a lot like us,''
he said. ``But let's be honest. We may be near Hollywood. But not
since Tom Hanks won an Oscar has there been that much acting in
Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the largely glowing reception Lieberman has drawn, his
selection has unsettled some liberal Democrats because of his
centrist stands. On Tuesday, he met with black delegates to
reassure them that he supported affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Wednesday night, he sought to establish his
credentials as champion for minorities. ``In the early 1960s, when
I was a college student, I walked with Martin Luther King in the
march on Washington,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who had not been widely viewed by most Democrats as a
likely choice for Gore _ and was plucked out of obscurity only
eight days ago _ still seems a bit fazed by his newfound celebrity
and, perhaps, that Gore dared to pick a Jew. As he put it in his
opening line, ``Is America a great country or what?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Before the program opened, Gore arrived here triumphantly,
stepping off Air Force Two for a rally at the Burbank airport with
Lieberman and their families. Only one day after President Clinton
embraced Gore in Monroe, Mich., as the inheritor of his political
legacy, the vice president moved to strike out on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every generation, we have to make the hard choices between
one direction or another, between going back to the past or forward
to the future,'' Gore declared. ``Let others argue the case for the
old guard. We're the new guard, and we're going to bring positive
change to the United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if manufactured, the suspense Wednesday was inside the
Staples Center, where more than 4,000 delegates converged for the
ritualistic, but joyous, roll call of states to officially award
Gore his party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore claimed enough delegates to put him over the top five
months ago, this remained a night of triumph _ and, at long last,
emergence _ for Gore. He represented Tennessee in the House for
nine years and the Senate for eight years, but has been best known
for his eight years of faithful service to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As did Cheney in Philadelphia two weeks ago, Lieberman used his
night in the spotlight to critique the opposition. He scolded
Republicans for putting forth what he portrayed as a misleading
festival of inclusion at its convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad the GOP has changed their rhetoric,'' he said, ``but
I wish they would also change their policies. As my friend John
McCain might say, let me do some straight talking about their
record.''
</P>
<P>
   In the excerpts of his speech, Lieberman's taunts at the
Republicans were far more subtle than Cheney's had been against the
Democrats, signaling that Lieberman may not be as willing to play
the traditional running-mate role of attack dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing that our opponent talks about education,''
Lieberman said. ``Schools need to be held to the highest standards
of performance and accountability. But I'm sad to say their plan
does not provide the resources our schools need to meet those high
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I've read their plan. To me, it seems like their
idea of school modernization means buying a new calendar for every
building.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Gore's often grueling primary race against Bill Bradley
and his high-profile assignments from Clinton, like running a
program to streamline the federal government, the vice president
remains something of a mystery to the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   It has become almost a cliche for people to describe Gore as
remote and hard to warm to. But Karenna Gore Schiff, Gore's eldest
daughter and one of his closest political advisers, sought to alter
that perception by describing a warm-hearted, conscientious Al Gore
that the public does not know.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my dad was a congressman, he listed our number in the
phone book in Carthage so the people he worked for could always
reach him,'' Schiff said in the prepared text of her speech
seconding Gore's nomination. ``During my summers on the farm, I
would answer the phone, and it would often be a constituent who
needed help getting his veterans' benefits, or finding the right
health care. I was taught to run _ not walk _ to get my dad so that
people wouldn't be kept waiting for a moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiff, who is 27, also spoke lovingly of her father. ``One time
he came home after a long day of hearings and meetings and votes
and found me struggling to begin that all-important elementary
school assignment: the dinosaur diorama,'' she recalled. ``He was
tired, but while my mom was getting the others to brush their teeth
and get in bed, my dad was the one who took me down to the store to
get the emergency Q-Tips, colored Play-Doh, and construction paper
because he was simply being a dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House Democratic leader whom Gore had
considered as his running mate, also spoke to the personal side of
Gore. ``Al Gore is a good man,'' he said. ``He is a decent, caring
man. He listens to his heart and his head. He loves his family. He
loves this country. He could be the best president this country
will ever have.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rubin, who was a treasury secretary under Clinton,
saluted Gore for his help in ensuring a vibrant economy. ``I worked
with Al Gore for six and a half years,'' he said. ``And he was a
powerful and effective force in all of the major economic policy
decisions that contributed so critically to this record. I was
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman also took some time to tell his personal story to the
American public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I try to see this world as my dad saw it from his
bakery truck,'' he said. ``About this time, he'd be getting ready
for the all-night run. I know that somewhere in America right now,
there is another father loading a bakery truck, or a young woman
programming a computer, or a parent dreaming of a better future for
their daughter or son.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can keep the faith,'' he went on, ``then 40 years from
now one of their children will stand before a gathering like this
with a chance to serve and lead this country that we love.''
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, at least, Lieberman brought the Democrats a
wave of favorable publicity in the days leading to the convention.
By turning to Lieberman, the first Democratic senator to
aggressively repudiate Clinton for his affair with a White House
intern, Gore underscored his determination to shed the president's
shadow.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews in the convention hall Wednesday, more than 20
delegates, one after another, said they had not known much about
Lieberman until last week. But many said they were impressed, even
thrilled, as they learned more about him.
</P>
<P>
   Eufaula Frazier, a delegate from Florida who is black, said she
also could relate to the historic nature of the Lieberman
selection. ``Forty years ago I was a beautician and we were all in
the shop watching the TV, so excited we were about Kennedy being
nominated,'' she said. ``The supply man came in and said it was
incredible, a Catholic in such a position. He said maybe one day it
will be a Jew. It is coming true tonight, and I get to be a part of
it.''

   (LOS ANGELES) - Dick Cheney wasn't referring to the Democratic
National Convention when he criticized Democrats earlier this month
for ``opportunities squandered.'' But he could have been.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Democrats' vice presidential nominee, Joe Lieberman,
capitalized handsomely on his prime-time opportunity Wednesday
night to introduce himself and his compelling life story to
American voters, much of the rest of the Democrats' quadrennial
show thus far has failed to live up to key strategy expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Take Tuesday's speaker lineup. To the party faithful crowded
into Staples Center, it was a nostalgic, popular, star-studded
cast. But giving Jesse Jackson and Ted Kennedy prime television
exposure violates nearly every modern-day party tenet.
</P>
<P>
   They are, after all, old-school liberals. Hardly representative
of the youthful New Democrat modernism that President Clinton
worked so hard to legitimize since winning the White House in 1992
and that Al Gore must project if he hopes to attract new voters to
his presidential ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the keynoter was a fresh-faced young congressman from
Tennessee named Harold Ford. And he gave it his best. But following
the likes of Jackson, Kennedy and still-popular former Sen. Bill
Bradley to the podium was simply too great a burden.
</P>
<P>
   In a twist symbolic of squandered convention opportunities, the
keynoter's speech was actually shorter than that of the supposed
warm-up act. But no matter. He was pushed out of prime time by the
party elders who preceded him to the podium and so hardly anyone
heard what he had to say anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' lack of discipline this week is just as evident
off the convention floor. While the Republicans can rightly be
accused of flaunting ``an illusion of inclusion'' at their
convention in Philadelphia earlier this month, their efforts paid
off in projecting a clearly focused message to the American public:
Opportunity for all Americans and we are uniting behind the goal of
achieving it.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats this week have gone to the opposite extreme,
actually unifying around very little. Mostly they are splintered.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there are more caucuses than state delegations.
You're a blue-eyed, former drug-abusing, lesbian Latina union
activist who has been victimized by global warming and wants to
save the whales? No problem. There's a celebration for you
somewhere in LA this week.
</P>
<P>
   It's a newfound sense of entitlement, this identity-by-caucus,
born perhaps, as one Democratic strategist speculated, from ``the
hubris of victory.'' Republicans, by contrast, all sang resolutely
from the same choir book in Philly. Dull, yes. Also effective.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this splintering of message, this thematic
disorganization, is a harbinger of Democratic frustration at the
polls this fall remains unclear. But Republicans managed to close
their convention in Philly having significantly boosted their image
among Americans nationwide. Democrats have yet to prove they will
do the same.

   LOS ANGELES _ The folks who honor fantasy on celluloid have to
draw the line somewhere _ and they did Wednesday over the phony
Oscar presented to President Clinton by Gov. Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Davis handed Clinton the mock fiberglass trophy as an ``honorary
Oscar for his achievements as president'' during the California
Welcome party on the Paramount Pictures lot Monday night in
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   However, John Pavlik, spokesman for the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences, wants to make clear that the statuette
``wasn't really an Oscar _ it was a counterfeit Oscar being used in
an inappropriate way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the Academy's reputation for holding on to its
Oscars hasn't been that stellar lately. Earlier this year, 55
Oscars en route from Chicago to Los Angeles disappeared from a
loading dock in Bell about a week before the Oscars ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Just in time, though, 52 of the missing statuettes were found by
Los Angeles junk salvager Willie Fulgear in a trash bin in
Koreatown, a discovery that made him almost as famous as the celebs
the Academy honors.
</P>
<P>
   Fulgear was invited to the Academy Awards ceremony and was given
a $50,000 reward by the shipping company, Roadway Express. A
Roadway Express employee accused of stealing the statuettes pleaded
no contest to grand theft and was sentenced to five years'
probation.
</P>
<P>
   The three missing Oscars failed to turn up, prompting comedian
Billy Crystal to joke at the ceremony that actor Jack Nicholson has
three Oscars, ``but so does some guy in Bell.''
</P>
<P>
   No, the one given Clinton was not one of the missing Oscars, but
a prop.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel Sanchez, spokesman for Davis, said the governor didn't
realize the use of a prop Oscar would pose a problem and added that
everyone at the party realized it was a fake.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another Hollywood fantasy.
