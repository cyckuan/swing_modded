GUN-TOTING CITIZEN ASSISTSPOLICE CAPTURE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   He drives a late-model Kia with a National Rifle Association
decal on the front window and ``Keep Honking, I'm Reloading''
emblazoned on the license-plate holder.
</P>
<P>
   He packs heat to work every night at his security-guard job and
has never hesitated to use it.
</P>
<P>
   So, a burly 27-year-old man named Rory Vertigan was the last guy
that three Mexican nationals arrested in the shooting death of
Phoenix police Officer Marc Atkinson wanted to see in their
rear-view mirror at the murder scene near 30th Avenue and Thomas
Road late Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   After the suspects pointed their weapons at him, Vertigan opened
fire with his 9 mm Glock, raking the vehicle with 14 rounds and
wounding one of the men in the back. When the man opened his door
and tried to run from the vehicle, Vertigan tackled him.
</P>
<P>
   Vertigan's valor was widely applauded in Phoenix police circles
for allowing officers to quickly catch up with and arrest the three
men.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Harold Hurtt was effusive in his praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``That individual is one of the true heroes of our time,'' Hurtt
said. ``He realizes the officer is in trouble. Without regard for
his own personal safety, he confronted these individuals, engaged
in a gunbattle. He put his life on the line for an officer and a
fellow human being.''
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement Saturday, Vertigan said he was only
reacting to ``what I thought was the right thing to do.'' He said
he figured he had to do something after watching Atkinson being
shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I confronted the individuals in the white vehicle, they
turned their guns on me. I was given no choice but to defend myself
with my weapon,'' Vertigan said.
</P>
<P>
   And that's something he's never hesitated to do, said Marilyn
Greenwood, Vertigan's sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had to use it a couple of times on his job,'' Greenwood
said. ``But I don't know if he's really hit anybody before.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenwood and Vertigan's mother, Joanne Vertigan, said that Rory
Vertigan was driving in that area after running an errand and
dropping his boss off at home. Vertigan manages an apartment
complex near 27th Avenue and Glendale Avenue during the day and
works as a security guard at night, Greenwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Rory Vertigan had followed the suspects' white Lincoln
Continental for a short distance and saw them stop. He also stopped
about 50 feet behind the suspects' vehicle. One of the men got out
and fired numerous rounds at Atkinson, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The three men then turned their attention to Vertigan, Greenwood
said. After weapons were pointed at him, Vertigan pulled out his
Glock, stuck it out the driver's-side window with his left hand and
fired several rounds.
</P>
<P>
   The assailants then slammed their car into reverse and struck
Vertigan's front bumper, leaving their license-plate number
imprinted in dust. They pulled forward and Vertigan continued
firing, striking one of the men with a round that went through the
back window and the seat in which he was sitting, Greenwood said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he emptied the clip with 14 shots and all of them went
inside the car. He thought that was pretty good since he shot quite
a few of them with his off hand, hanging out the window,''
Greenwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Vertigan saw one of the men fleeing the scene out of the corner
of his eye before he tackled the man he shot, she said, adding that
he told her that he never saw the third suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Vertigan had designs on being a policeman as a child in Tucson
and had taken law-enforcement classes at Pima Community College,
his sister and mother said.
</P>
<P>
   But after managing a Tucson fast-food restaurant for a couple
years, Vertigan decided to embark upon a career as a private
investigator. He also dabbled in security-guard work, providing
security at three Miss Arizona Pageants in the early 1990s, Joanne
Vertigan said.
</P>
<P>
   Vertigan had been working at his current jobs for the past six
years, Greenwood said, and has been cited by the city for his work
in Block Watch organizations along the 27th Avenue corridor.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwood said that her brother also has had a concealed-weapons
permit for several years and had just had it renewed shortly before
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Vertigan, who was interviewed throughout the day Saturday by
police detectives, thanked police for providing professional
counseling ``so that I can better deal with the stress I incurred
during this traumatic event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need time for healing,'' he said in his prepared statement.

SWIMMER HALL DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Olympic gold and silver medalist Gary Hall Jr. is
contemplating retirement from swimming after learning last week
that he has diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm considering retirement at this point,'' said Hall, who
withdrew from this week's national championships in New York after
he was told by a family physician that diabetes is the reason he
has begun to suffer from bouts of fatigue and dizziness. ``It's not
just for any one event. It's for a whole string of events.''
</P>
<P>
   Diabetes is just the latest blow in Hall's career since 1996,
when he finished second to Russian sprinter Alexander Popov in a
couple of memorable Olympic duels and then anchored two gold
medal-winning relays for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Hall was suspended for three months last summer by the
International Olympic Committee after the IOC ruled that he tested
positive for marijuana. The test and the IOC ruling were
controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Hall eventually won an 11th-hour court order in Phoenix that
allowed him to compete in September in a World Cup meet at Baylor
University. He went on to win the 50-meter freestyle over Brazil's
Fernando Scherer, the world's top-ranked sprinter this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the suspension still cost him a lucrative endorsement deal
with Speedo.
</P>
<P>
   Hall always has been at odds with USA Swimming, a U.S. Olympic
Committee organization that runs the sport nationally. Some coaches
and officials have been unhappy with Hall's offbeat, go-it-alone
style.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1998 World Championships at Perth, Australia, he faced
a disciplinary hearing for alleged transgressions of a conduct
code. One of the charges involved his decision to wear a wig for
the team picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole string of events has made me wonder,'' said Hall,
who had been training at Arizona State in an attempt to retain the
50- and 100-meter freestyle titles he won at last spring's
nationals. ``I don't enjoy it anymore. I really don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, 24, said he will think through his options.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to retreat, look at the future and try to come up
with a strategy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If he decides to continue at swimming's highest level, he will
have to learn how live and train with diabetes. Hall's agent, Janey
Miller, said he has started insulin injections and is working on
stabilizing his blood sugar.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's learning to adjust to this new situation and hopes to be
back in the pool soon,'' Miller said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he saw his physician after feeling weak nine days ago.
He said he also had suffered from unusual fatigue after workouts
during the past couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   ``My arms would shake, and I thought that maybe it was just from
hard training,'' Hall said. ``At the time, I thought that was good.
But maybe not.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall is considered to be perhaps America's greatest swimming
talent. He has been projected as a gold medal contender at the 2000
Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 at Atlanta, one of his memorable performances came on
the anchor leg of the 400-meter freestyle relay. Hall was timed at
47.45 seconds, the fastest relay split in history.
</P>
<P>
   In the individual 100 freestyle, his best time, 48.81, puts him
among a handful of men ever to have gone faster than 49. In the
individual event, nobody has been faster than 48. &QL;

TRAIL BLAZERS CHECK EGOS, FILL ROLE OF TITLE CONTENDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - In a strange NBA season known for missed shots and a
missing person, there actually is some news that proves the game
itself has not gone on a Dennis Rodman walkabout.
</P>
<P>
   Meet the Portland Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, meeting them is probably not what the struggling Suns
have in mind tonight at America West Arena. The Suns are in need of
a little R&AMP;R at this point. But the Los Angeles Clippers aren't
available.
</P>
<P>
   So, ready or not, the Suns will have take their chances against
the Blazers for the second time in four nights. If Thursday night's
result _ a 97-84 Portland victory _ is any indication, the Suns
don't have much of chance. Nonetheless, there is admiration.
</P>
<P>
   In the Blazers, there is plenty to admire.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, they were the problem children of the NBA.
Jail Blazers and Bail Raisers.
</P>
<P>
   But in this shortened season, old problems have vanished. The
Blazers have gone from trouble to the top. How did it happen?
There's nothing magic about it. Rodman's hair styles change and the
crossover dribble replaces the slam as the flavor of the day, but
the game's fundamentals stay the same. The Blazers have been
preaching unselfishness, depth, defense and versatility.
</P>
<P>
   Boring? Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   But the old ethics are as ruthlessly efficient as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say that it's easy, and the bottom line is that it's
not over,'' said Blazers Coach Mike Dunleavy, who is among the
leading candidates for Coach of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Blazers appear to be maturing at a pace that
makes them real contenders. They have the league's best record, and
there's no sign that they are about to slip from the perch. Above
all, the old problem kids have learned to trim the sails on their
egos.
</P>
<P>
   The value of roles within a larger system has been a key to the
Portland success. What's more, that has allowed Dunleavy to
distribute playing time throughout his deep roster. In a compressed
season with four and five games a week, Portland's talented, rested
bench has been able to overwhelm fatigued opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come at you with wave after wave,'' Suns center Luc
Longley said. ``It's as if they have 20 talented guys sitting on
that bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Portland's roster isn't any larger than any other in
the league. But with an acceptance of diminished minutes and
changing roles, Longley's count is accurate in one respect: The
Blazers throw more combinations onto the floor than any other NBA
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys have embraced the idea of winning,'' said Dunleavy,
whose club plays a ferocious perimeter defense that starts with
Isaiah Rider and former University of Arizona star Damon Stoudamire
and continues with Jim Jackson, Stacey Augmon, Greg Anthony, Walt
Williams and Kelvin Cato. ``The fact is that we have a lot of
depth. Because guys are playing well, there are going to be nights
when one guy gets more minutes than another.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it happens to be at your position, you just have to check
your ego at the door and be satisfied with the fact that we're
winning. That's what it takes to win. So far, it's worked.''
</P>
<P>
   The genesis of Portland's success came through player
acquisitions. The Blazers do not have a lottery draft pick of their
own. But through trades or free agency, General Manager Bob
Whitsitt put together a team that includes 10 players who were
lottery picks of other teams.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead and count them: Rider, Stoudamire, starting forward
Brian Grant, Rasheed Wallace, Williams, Jackson, Anthony, Augmon,
Carlos Rogers and Bonzi Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of them arrived in Portland marked by some difficult
times at other NBA stops. Call it a mark of maturity. The result is
a team that can play a front line that averages nearly 7 feet. It
also can play its own version of small ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe one or two combinations aren't working, but we can go
with so many,'' Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   For the opposition, it's a rigged game of Russian roulette.
There's a bullet in every chamber. &QL;

U.S. WOMEN'S SOCCER TEAM NEEDS TUNEUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM THOMAS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ It begins here, today, at the Rose Bowl.
Whether it ends here in July is a little less certain than it was a
short time ago.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the U.S. national team still is favored to win Women's World
Cup '99, which will conclude with the championship match at the
Rose Bowl. There is no need to panic and perform a complete
overhaul, even if there were enough time, which there isn't. But as
the team embarks on its ``Road to Pasadena'' tour, a tuneup
certainly is in order.
</P>
<P>
   Today's match with Mexico is the first stop on the tour. The
game begins at 3 p.m. (Arizona time) and will be the opener of a
doubleheader, with East Valley native Greg Vanney's Los Angeles
Galaxy and the Dallas Burn of MLS to follow. The U.S. team will
play eight other matches before the World Cup begins June 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``These games are key to us fine-tuning and preparing for the
biggest challenge that this team has ever faced,'' U.S. Coach Tony
DiCicco said.
</P>
<P>
   The tour was supposed to be highlighted by Mia Hamm's
record-setting 108th international goal, or maybe even a
celebration of her having set the mark during the Algarve Cup two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Hamm failed to tally in Portugal, leaving her three behind
former Italian star Elisabetta Vignotto's international
goal-scoring record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mia had a very good performance,'' DiCicco said after
a practice session Saturday. ``It's just that because of the
incredible year she had last year, she is the object of a lot of
attention on the soccer field. She may not have scored, but she had
some assists, and she drew attention so other players could have
opportunities. That's what Mia's game is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm wasn't the only American shut out during the Cup. In fact,
if not for a four-goal outburst against Finland and Tiffeny
Milbrett's Cup-high four tallies, the U.S. team might have left
Portugal in shame instead of in second place.
</P>
<P>
   Although the U.S. team enters today's match with a 6-1-1 record
in 1999, the lack of scoring might be a concern. Apparently not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about it,'' DiCicco said. ``Teams have just
not been playing very open games against us, and we've run up
against some very good goalkeepers.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is one of the weaker teams that qualified for the World
Cup, and the U.S. team posted convincing victories the three
previous times the teams have met.
</P>
<P>
   But Mexico appears to be on the rise, having defeated Argentina
in a two-game playoff to earn the final World Cup berth. In that
series, Mexico started six Mexican-Americans, including sensational
midfielder Laurie Hill of West Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they went out and looked for help from some of the
better Mexican-American players, so they won't be the same team we
faced last time,'' DiCicco said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no disrespect to Mexico, I'm more concerned about my team.
We need to go out with the right mentality, and we have to
execute.'' &QL;

DETROIT PAYS PRICE IN BID FOR 3RD CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who were the big winners and the big losers at last week's NHL
trading deadline?
</P>
<P>
   Detroit, Buffalo, San Jose and the Coyotes all helped
themselves, joining Colorado and Philadelphia, which made earlier
moves by acquiring stars  &UR; Theo Fleury and  &UR; Mark Recchi,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes got the scoring punch they wanted at center on the
second line by stealing  &UR; Robert Reichel away from the Islanders.
The Sharks got stronger by adding  &UR; Vincent Damphousse. And the
Sabres improved by bringing in  &UR; Joe Juneau from Washington and
 &UR; Rhett Warrener from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings, of course, made the most noise, blowing away the
rest of the league by not only picking up  &UR; Ulf Samuelsson from the
Rangers, but then by trading for Chicago Blackhawks defenseman
 &UR; Chris Chelios, who reportedly asked to be dealt. After that, they
made two separate deals with Tampa Bay and acquired  &UR; Wendel Clark
and then  &UR; Bill Ranford.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like it and I've been in this
business for 30 years,'' Detroit Coach Scotty Bowman said. ``I
think it gives us a better feeling in the room that this team means
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings gave up a ton in loading themselves up to make a
couple more runs at the Stanley Cup. Two first-round picks to
Chicago and a great young player in  &UR; Anders Ericksson, a former
first-round pick himself, for the 37-year-old Chelios. A
second-round pick and goalie
 &UR; Kevin Hodson to Tampa for the 32-year-old Clark. A second- and
third-round pick to New York for the 35-year-old Samuelsson. A
conditional pick to Tampa for the 32-year-old Ranford.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Detroit doesn't own a single pick in the first three
rounds of the June draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't sit here and tell you we're not going to miss what we
gave up,'' Red Wings General Manager  &UR; Ken Holland said. ``But if
you want to win, that's what you have to do. Look at what Colorado
gave up for Fleury, and he isn't signed beyond this year.''
</P>
<P>
   They're hilariously happy in Hockeytown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the confidence (to try to win a third straight Cup),
but playing the way we have all year, probably not,'' wing  &UR; Darren
McCarty said. ``But none of that matters now.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't guarantee the Red Wings of scoring a championship hat
trick, but they definitely become one of the favorites again. Too
bad Dallas didn't do more than add  &UR; Derek Plante, who might not
play above the fourth line, and reacquire oldster  &UR; Benoit Hogue.
The Stars could have used more than that.
</P>
<P>
   Playoff-bound Pittsburgh, Carolina, Boston and New Jersey did
next to nothing, which was a surprise. But the biggest
disappointment has to be Calgary, a club very alive in the
postseason race despite trading away Fleury, which only picked up
 &UR; Tom Chorske from the Capitals _ hardly a payoff for how hard the
Flames players have been working. &QL; 
Trade Day memories &QL; 
Mighty Ducks forward  &UR; Jim McKenzie, a former Coyote, remembers
sweating it out four years ago on the last day of the trading
deadline while he was playing in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   With about an hour to go before the deadline passes, his
telephone rang.
</P>
<P>
   ``I jumped out of my skin and grabbed the phone,'' McKenzie
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was only teammate  &UR; Gord Donnelly, calling to see whether he
needed a ride to practice. Knowing how nervous McKenzie was,
Donnelly couldn't resist calling again about 10 minutes later. This
time, he wanted to know whether McKenzie wanted to stop for some
coffee on the way.
</P>
<P>
   You know what's coming next, right? Ten minutes later, the phone
rings again, and McKenzie is furious.
</P>
<P>
   Only it wasn't Donnelly. It was Stars General Manager  &UR; Bob
Gainey, who after listening to the unsuspecting McKenzie rant and
rave, politely told him, ``You've been traded to Pittsburgh.'' &QL; 
Dom and dumber &QL; 
You'll never guess what Buffalo Sabres goalie  &UR; Dominik Hasek did
last week.
</P>
<P>
   On the advice of a friend, tennis player  &UR; Petr Korda, the
two-time Hart Trophy winner actually asked and received permission
from the club to travel all the way to Germany to consult with a
Munich physician about his nagging groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   No, this is not an early April Fool's joke. We are not making
this up.
</P>
<P>
   Please. Like they're aren't any qualified doctors a little
closer to seek for a second opinion? That the Sabres even let him
go is an absolute joke.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. The plane ride alone couldn't have helped his
pulled muscle. But forget that. Before he left, Hasek already had
returned from the injured list and played three straight
outstanding games, reporting little to no pain afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Dom, 95 percent is not good enough,'' General Manager
Darcy Regier said. ``He's intent on getting back to 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek flew back Friday night and was in nets for Saturday's game
against the Pittsburgh Penguins, stopping 36 of 37 shots in a 1-1
tie. &QL; 
LA Confidential &QL; 
In the world of free agency, Los Angeles Kings General Manager
 &UR; Dave &UR; Taylor was saying the other day, teams generally have to
commit to shelling out more dollars and more years than they
usually think a player is worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in a lot of cases,'' Taylor said, ``you don't get a fair
return for your investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case with defenseman  &UR; Steve Duchesne, whom the
Kings lured away from St. Louis with a four-year contract worth $15
million. After scoring only four goals and adding 19 assists in 60
games, and getting beat too often in his own zone, the Kings
decided to place the veteran on waivers.
</P>
<P>
   When nobody was silly enough to pick him up, the club bought
Duchesne out of his contract, eating $4.25 million, and then
shipped him to Philadelphia for  &UR; Dave Babych and a draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a very difficult, very expensive lesson,'' Taylor
said. ``I don't know if you will see us too active in the free
agent market in the future.'' &QL;

JORDAN RETURN AS OWNER WOULD BE PERFECT FIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You just knew  &UR; Michael Jordan couldn't stay out of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   He may have hung up his Airs, but it appears Jordan is close to
returning to the league as an owner of the Charlotte Hornets. The
``Charlotte Observer'' reported Saturday that Jordan and the club's
current owner,  &UR; George Shinn, are negotiating such a deal.
</P>
<P>
   And the NBA confirmed it by releasing a statement from
Commissioner
 &UR; David Stern, which said Jordan is seeking 50 percent of the club.
It would seem to be the perfect fit.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan gets back into the game, and he does it in North
Carolina, where he grew up and led the University of North Carolina
to an NCAA championship.
</P>
<P>
   Shinn, who is fighting a civil action that accuses him of sexual
assault and a divorce action, can go back to Florida, save 7.5
percent on the transaction in sales tax and remain in the
background.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets once were one of the most popular teams in the
league. While they never went deep into the playoffs, they had some
on-court success and their merchandise was among the best-selling
in the league.
</P>
<P>
   But Shinn, who has sought a new arena, was cheap. He let  &UR; Alonzo
 &UR; Mourning go to Miami because he didn't want to pay him. He let
 &UR; Vlade
 &UR; Divac and  &UR; Matt Geiger exit last summer because he didn't want to
pay them, either. The club recently unloaded All-Star  &UR; Glen Rice,
and Coach
 &UR; Dave Cowens resigned this year in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has the money to make it work. He reportedly generates
annual endorsement income of about $45 million. The club reportedly
is valued at about $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   There's just one catch. It's difficult to imagine Jordan taking
anything less than controlling interest in the team. A 50-50 split
doesn't make sense. The guess here is that Jordan will have
control, or he won't make the deal. &QL; 
He's high on Phil &QL; 
Miami Coach  &UR; Pat Riley took a little swipe at  &UR; Phil Jackson, the
former Bulls coach who is spending his time working with
presidential hopeful &UR; Bill Bradley, after Jackson suggested that
this season's NBA champion will be tainted by a season shortened to
50 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think it's the effect of that window pane he took in
'70, I just really do,'' Riley said, referring to a street name for
LSD. ``Those synapses don't fire like they used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a non-active right now. He should have no opinion about
the NBA. He's not in it. He would love it to be tainted because
he's the only one that's tasted victory the last six years.''
</P>
<P>
   Well actually,  &UR; Rudy Tomjanovich tasted it twice in Houston.
Maybe Riles ran into that ``window pane'' somewhere along the way. &QL; 
Oooooops &QL; 
Atlanta's  &UR; Alan Henderson was fined $3,500 by the league for
throwing a ball over the lower stands at the Georgia Dome during a
loss to Milwaukee. But the fine didn't hurt nearly as much as this:
The ball struck the face of  &UR; Nancy Mutombo, the 13-year-old
daughter of Henderson's teammate,  &UR; Dikembe Mutombo. She was not
seriously hurt but was treated at a first aid station, where she
remained for the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a freak thing,'' said Dikembe Mutombo, who accepted
Henderson's apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad it wasn't serious, no matter who it was,''
Henderson said. &QL; 
Promises, promises &QL; 
After another humiliating loss, this time to Cleveland, Boston
Coach &UR; Rick Pitino said he'd had enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to stay positive, upbeat, but that was humiliating
defense,'' Pitino said. ``I've seen the Washington Generals play
defense better than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the team that I haven't raised my voice this year and I
understand the lockout has prevented us from teaching the little
things of the game. There reaches a point, though, and I won't be
humiliated. Yes, it's all well and good that next year is next
year, but I'm going to watch this film and if people are
humiliating the Boston Celtics, they're not going to play anymore.
It's as simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino added that he could win more games with a Continental
Basketball Association team that is good on defense. Then he
started the same players in Boston's next game. &QL; 
Keep the Candy &QL; 
Toronto Coach  &UR; Butch Carter is thanking his stars and the NBA
lottery every time he watches rookie  &UR; Vince Carter create another
highlight and take another step toward the Rookie of the Year
award.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to get bigger,''  &UR; Butch Carter said. ``So we
probably would have drafted (7-l center)  &UR; Michael Olowokandi.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers drafted Olowokandi with the first overall pick, and
they have the league's worst record. The Raptors drafted North
Carolina's
 &UR; Antawn Jamison at No. 4 and traded him for Tar Heel teammate  &UR; Vince
 &UR; Carter, picked at No. 5 by Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were playing the Clippers the other night,'' Butch
Carter said, ``I turned, looked at my assistant coaches and said,
`If we had taken Olowokandi, we would have been fired by now.'' &QL; 
New tune &QL; 
 &UR; Scottie Pippen has softened his stance somewhat about being left
out of the offense in Houston. He sounded off after Houston lost a
game in Phoenix and complained that he wasn't involved.
</P>
<P>
   Now he says he wasn't campaigning for more shots, just
opportunities to have the ball in his hands, to score or create for
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty much what it was _ it's not about me trying to
do anything offensively, asking for more shots or anything,''
Pippen said. ``It's more about the opportunity to be involved and
helping to get everybody else set up and sort of get some type of
rhythm to our offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel much better. I feel like I'm being utilized, and I'm
able to be a big part of the team's offense. I think it's made a
difference to our team. It was probably my fault more so than
anything. But this has allowed me to have more leadership and
control of the games.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Pippen knew exactly what he was saying, and he
got the desired results. &QL;

STAPLETON BECOMING AN ALL-AROUND FORWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - He usually toils in relative anonymity, but
all-purpose Coyote  &UR; Mike Stapleton has been making himself noticed
lately.
</P>
<P>
   He has four goals in the past seven games, including the game
winner against Anaheim on March 13, and is a goal away from tying
his career high (10).
</P>
<P>
   ``We can use him at all three positions: center, left wing or
right wing,'' Coach  &UR; Jim Schoenfeld said. ``He has done a
tremendous job of killing penalties for us, and he really has
scored some important goals. He has been a very valuable
contributor to the team all season long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the season it has been in a defensive role, along with
 &UR; Bob Corkum, Juha Ylonen and  &UR; Mike Sullivan. Through the injuries to
Ylonen and Corkum and to Sullivan, Mike has been there and has
carried the load on the penalty kill. We use  &UR; (Jeremy) Roenick and
 &UR; (Keith)
 &UR; Tkachuk with the other guys out, but Mike has been the constant.
Plus, if we had injuries during a game to our defensive corps, we
can even put him back at the blue line. He did that last year.'' &QL; 
OK debut &QL; 
The Coyotes wasted little time putting defenseman  &UR; Stan Neckar to
work. Obtained just before Monday's trading deadline from the New
York Rangers, he played Thursday night against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``He finished his checks well, kept it clear in front of the net
and put some people on the seat of their pants,'' Schoenfeld said.
``He hasn't played in a while, so I would expect his game to
continue to improve. I thought it was a good first game for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Neckar played in only 18 games with the Rangers. &QL; 
Power fade &QL; 
With the Coyotes' power play struggling at 12.2 percent, which is
second worst in the NHL, some have suggested that opponents' lack
of respect for the unit has allowed them to take liberties.
</P>
<P>
   Almost to a man, the Coyotes scoff at the notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime a team has a man advantage, it provides them with a
better chance to score, so teams aren't going to purposely take
penalties,'' defenseman  &UR; Keith Carney said. ``Most of the time it's
the same guys killing penalties, so you don't want to wear them
down, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld has a slightly different view.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might be a little less cautious, but I don't think it
goes the other way where they are more careless, if that makes any
sense,'' he said. ``We play a lot of teams with their power play
struggling, and I don't say this is a night when we can take six
minors. You're putting yourself at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say we're playing Nashville, which has a bad power play. I'm
thinking their best chance of beating us is to get a couple of
power-play goals. We don't want to give them free opportunities.
You want to make your opponent earn everything. Earn the ice. Earn
scoring chances. Don't want to give them a free chance by missing
an assignment, being lazy or by taking an undisciplined or
retaliatory penalty. That never changes.'' &QL;

ANDERSON ENJOYS TAKING RELIEF ROUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON - Diamondbacks pitcher  &UR; Brian Anderson pitched the ninth
inning Saturday for his first save of the spring in a 3-1 victory
over a split squad of San Francisco Giants that included  &UR; Barry
Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he loved the rush he got from closing. He said he
had saved a game one other time in his major league career, but
that was a three-inning gig.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I've got, I'm just laying it out full bore,'' he
said. ``I don't have to pace myself for seven innings.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager  &UR; Buck Showalter said he'd like to see Anderson pitch in
back-to-back games before the start of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   But he said not to read anything into Anderson's closing role.
 &UR; Gregg
 &UR; Olson, who saved 30 games last season, has been bothered by
tendinitis in his wrist and forearm but is close to being back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy with Gregg Olson as our closer, but this gives us
another option if it doesn't work out with Oly,'' Showalter said. &QL; 
Castillo released &QL; 
Right-hander  &UR; Frank Castillo, a non-roster invitee, was released.
Showalter and General Manager  &UR; Joe Garagiola met with Castillo
after the game. Showalter said he hoped another club would pick up
Castillo, who spent eight seasons in the majors and had a 3.97
earned-run average and no decisions in 11 innings this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll get a strong recommendation from us for anyone who wants
to inquire about him,'' Showalter said. ``He's the definition of a
pro.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter said there was too much pitching depth at Triple-A
Tucson to option Castillo down to the minors.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo left immediately after the news and couldn't be
reached.
</P>
<P>
   Another roster move could happen today.
</P>
<P>
   The club has 35 players, including injured outfielder  &UR; Tony
Womack, who is expected to open the season on the disabled list.
Showalter needs to cut to 25 by next week. &QL; 
Still waiting &QL; 
The team awaits the arrival of Korean pitching phenom  &UR; Byung-Hyun
Kim, who is expected to join soon. Like today, they hope. But the
20-year-old won't be thrust onto the mound immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, a right-hander who helped lead the Korean nationals to the
final of the World Championships in Italy, could land anywhere from
the opening-day roster to Double-A El Paso. &QL; 
Kicking back &QL; 
Outfielder  &UR; Luis Gonzalez settled into third baseman  &UR; Matt
Williams' black leather recliner that sits in the spring training
clubhouse. Williams, who plans to move the chair into the Bank One
Ballpark clubhouse for the season, got the chair last week to take
pressure off the lumbar area in his back. Williams had the day off.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to take advantage of when he's not here,'' Gonzalez
said. &QL; 
Shortstops &QL; 
Starter  &UR; Randy Johnson said his groin felt better. Showalter said
he would decide today whether Johnson would take ``a work day'' on
Monday. He is tentatively scheduled to start Wednesday.

EYE-FOR-AN-EYE BALL ISN'T PRETTY

<P>
   PHOENIX - Whether it's an elbow in the paint or a chop block out
of an official's view, retaliation has become an accepted part of
sports. But this beanball business tends to bring out the worst in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, it was Diamondbacks pitcher  &UR; Rich Batchelor's plunk
of Chicago Cubs second baseman  &UR; Mickey Morandini, which was fueled
by  &UR; Rod
 &UR; Beck's beaning of  &UR; Travis Lee. Follow? (Translation: Nyah nyah nyah
nyah nyah.)
</P>
<P>
   The bench-clearing shoving exchange wasn't even the worst part.
It was the sight of the Cubs'  &UR; Tyler Houston standing on the top
step of the dugout clapping as Arizona trainers tended to
Batchelor, who had just been nailed in the leg by a  &UR; Sammy Sosa
line drive.
</P>
<P>
   Retaliation was at the heart of verbal warfare between Seattle
reliever  &UR; Jose Paniagua and Anaheim designated hitter  &UR; Phil
 &UR; Nevin on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The two had to be separated after the game because Nevin was
irked when Paniagua sailed a fastball over his head. The previous
hitter,
 &UR; Orlando Palmeiro, stole a meaningless base late in the 9-3 Seattle
win.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Nevin said, ``I don't forget. He better hope he doesn't
run into me outside the field. I'm the type of guy who doesn't back
down from anything. If we do, he ain't going to pitch again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was telling me he's got my number. I'll give him my home
phone number. Let him come over to my house. People like him are a
. . . disgrace to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Dates to remember (if you like potential brawls): April 16, when
the Mariners visit Anaheim, and June 7, when the Diamondbacks host
the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of tempers, White Sox pitcher  &UR; Jaime Navarro lost his
after outfielders  &UR; Chris Singleton and  &UR; Jeff Abbott let a fly ball
drop between them.
</P>
<P>
   After glaring at his teammates, Navarro slammed a cooler and
threw a few things in the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see Jaime staring at us,'' Abbott told reporters,
``but I've seen it before. It used to bother me, but it doesn't
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The hottest position battle in the Cactus League remains the
Angels' starting job at third.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Troy Glaus has been dominating at the plate, but  &UR; Dave Hollins,
who has been slowed by a hamstring injury, has a guaranteed $2.4
million contract. If Glaus wins, a Hollins trade appears to be a
real possibility.
</P>
<P>
   If Colorado center field prospect  &UR; Jody Gerut seems a little
preoccupied, there's a reason.
</P>
<P>
   Gerut, who was drafted in the second round, came to spring
training needing to complete a take-home exam in his human
sexuality course (no jokes, please) and to write a 20-page paper on
Soviet patent law.
</P>
<P>
   The completion would enable him to get his degree from Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   To fans who inquired why  &UR; Barry Bonds,  &UR; J.T. Snow and
 &UR; Jeff Kent didn't play with San Francisco on Monday at Municipal
Stadium, here's the answer: lighting concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't want (Bonds) getting hit upside the head with
those lights,'' Giants Manager  &UR; Dusty Baker said. ``It's simple.
J.T. hasn't played much, so his reaction time isn't going to be the
same. Same thing with Jeff.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the club was informed before the game that new
lights had been installed, Baker didn't want to take a chance.
</P>
<P>
   From the feeling-old department:  &UR; Chuck Finley is beginning his
``14th'' season with the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it's part of the game, but all these trade rumors
flying around have to be wearing on infielder  &UR; Fernando Vina.
</P>
<P>
   Saw Seattle's 6-foot-11 prospect  &UR; Ryan Anderson throw three
innings against the Cubs on Friday. Wow.
</P>
<P>
   Angels pitcher  &UR; Tim Belcher has been awarded the start for the
opener against Cleveland on April 6.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox still have not announced a fifth starter to join
 &UR; Mike Sirotka,  &UR; Jim Parque,  &UR; James Baldwin and  &UR; John Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro may be the guy, but  &UR; Scott Eyre,  &UR; Carlos Castillo and
 &UR; Kevin
 &UR; Beirne also want a shot.
</P>
<P>
   Based on what we've seen,  &UR; Jay Buhner is close to realizing his
goal: starting in right field on opening day. Let's not forget he
underwent  &UR; Tommy John surgery on his right elbow only seven months
ago. &QL;

BELGRADE SHAKEN BY THE INTENSITY OF LATEST RAIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Subs to update, reorganize and rewrite; this story is now on

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Residents of Belgrade, the Serbian
capital, said Saturday that for the first time since the NATO
bombing started, large explosions had occurred in the city before
air raid sirens sounded, giving credence to NATO assertions that
Yugoslavia's integrated air defense system has been damaged, even
around the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night, for the first time, everyone in Belgrade felt the
real impact of the war,'' said Vesna Prlja, who runs a tourist
agency. ``Everyone could see the big explosions in the central city
and the suburbs. People use the mornings to try to get some
sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   And with the price of gasoline rising more than sevenfold and a
prominent Serbian journalist arrested Saturday for offending new
censorship rules, the citizens of Belgrade appear considerably
shaken after the heaviest night of NATO bombing in and around the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   During daylight at about 4:45 p.m., there was a loud explosion
on the western edge of Belgrade, and at around 7 Saturday night,
the street lights were suddenly extinguished, presumably by the
authorities, leaving the city dark and eerie.
</P>
<P>
   This correspondent, ordered to leave Serbia on Thursday and
refused re-entry at the border with Croatia on Friday, was able to
return early Saturday morning from the Hungarian border with the
help of the federal information minister, Deputy Prime Minister Vuk
Draskovic. Draskovic, a relatively liberal nationalist, has been
trying to reverse the order for deportation of journalists from
NATO countries that was originally issued by the Serbian
information minister, Alexander Vucic.
</P>
<P>
   All of Serbia's television channels played patriotic themes
Saturday. There was news coverage of NATO attacks and of protests
against them in Greece and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   President Slobodan Milosevic, after meeting the Ukrainian
defense and foreign ministers, described NATO's attack on
Yugoslavia as criminal and said, ``It is the duty of all free
countries to stand up to the military despotism of NATO, led by the
United States, which is destroying the United Nations system and
represents the most serious threat to international peace and
security since World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   After a steady diet of patriotic films, all seven channels also
showed the film ``Wag the Dog'' many times Saturday, following the
example of television in Iraq during the early days of American air
strikes there in December. The movie is about an American president
who pretends to attack a foreign country to divert attention from a
sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   But there was very little information on events in Kosovo and no
way for ordinary citizens to hear Western charges of a full-scale
offensive by Serbian forces against ethnic Albanians there or
accusations that large numbers of civilian men are being rounded up
and killed by Serbian Interior Ministry soldiers and police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was it possible for Western correspondents, expelled from
Kosovo and hampered by police checkpoints and roadblocks, to judge
the situation there easily. Attempts to telephone Pristina were
unsuccessful.

   Two years ago,  &UR; Kyle Kosier was a 6-foot-6, 215-pound
linebacker. These days, he's a 6-6, 285-pound guard.

scrimmage on Saturday. Junior  &UR; Korey Ramsay, who didn't play
because of a shoulder injury, is expected to have first crack at
the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Kosier on the first team were  &UR; Scott Peters, who has
moved to center,  &UR; Marvel Smith at left tackle,  &UR; Victor Leyva at
right tackle and
 &UR; Thomas Schmidt at right guard.
</P>
<P>
   The influx of offensive line recruits will give the Sun Devils
some much-needed depth and possibly force some competition at the
guard spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to adjust to the technique,'' said Kosier, who
played defensive end last season. ``I'm used to flying out on the
ball, but now I have to wait for it to come to me. People think
it's an easy transition to offensive line, but it's not at all.'' &QL; 
A real who's who &QL; 
A crowd of nearly 400 watched the scrimmage, including high school
coaches who were taking part in a clinic with ASU's staff.
</P>
<P>
   Quite a few recruits who will join the Sun Devils in August also
were there, including offensive lineman  &UR; Regis Crawford, from San
Diego Morse High;  &UR; Frank Maddox, a tight end from Celina (Texas)
High; and linebacker  &UR; Jamall Anderson and cornerback  &UR; Nijrell
Eason, teammates at Long Beach City College.
</P>
<P>
   Eason and Anderson said they made the 5{-hour drive from Los
Angeles just so they could watch the scrimmage.  &QL; 
Scrimmage highlights &QL; 
If Saturday is any indication, the Sun Devils will be throwing to
their backs often.  &UR; Gerald Green and  &UR; Davaren Hightower caught
several passes, and Hightower found his way into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end  &UR; Quincy Yancy intercepted a pass from 6-4
quarterback
 &UR; Matt Cooper, whose potential was obvious although he said he was
disappointed with his performance.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said he's not even thinking about Camp Tontozona, when a
battle for the backup job is expected to brew between him and  &UR; John
 &UR; Leonard, a transfer from El Camino Community College.
</P>
<P>
   Quick hit &QL; 
The Sun Devils filled a hole in their 2000 schedule by securing
Colorado State for a Sept. 16 meeting in Tempe. &QL;

 BELGRADE, Yugoslavia: were unsuccessful.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was 10 years ago this week that Milosevic, then president of
Serbia, stripped away Kosovo's autonomy, causing celebrations in
Belgrade and protests by ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   None of a dozen people interviewed had seen or heard statements
taped by President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Censorship has been strict here under the rules laid down by
Vucic, the Serbian information minister, who is a member of the
strongly nationalist Vojislav Seselj party. NATO is normally
referred to as ``criminal,'' and Clinton and Albright are labeled
``killers.''
</P>
<P>
   According to reliable Serbs, a prominent Serbian journalist,
Dragoslav Rancic, a senior contributing editor of the weekly
magazine Nin, was arrested Saturday for an article about Milosevic
and his negotiating style that was considered to have broken
censorship rules.
</P>
<P>
   While the magazine had passed censorship, its editor, Stevan
Niksic, was told after printing that there were ``second
thoughts.'' The magazine was distributed anyway, and police
arrested Rancic at his home at 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Editors were also informed Saturday that they must provide first
editions of newspapers to Vucic's ministry every night for
approval. Most newspapers either are not appearing at all or are in
smaller, cheaper editions. Glas Javnosti, for instance, dropped its
price in half. The only newspaper to appear in its usual size is
the government-run Politika.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's Politika had a full-page advertisement in
Serbo-Croatian and English from workers of the Zastava automobile
and weapons factory in Kragujevac, north of Belgrade, which has
been a NATO target.
</P>
<P>
   The Zastava employees announced that 38,000 people worked there
and informed NATO that an attack at any time would kill several
thousand people working on wartime shifts. The ad gave the
longitude and latitude of the factory and said workers and their
families would hold rallies there, to make any death toll higher.
</P>
<P>
   Even on another bright and sunny day, the streets were much
emptier, of both cars and people, than on a normal Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are exhausted with tension and little sleep because of
the nightly bombings and the need to tramp down to the shelters,''
said Ms. Prlja, who said her tourist agency has ``not so many
tourists these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline and diesel fuel are being rationed, with many stations
closed. The price of gasoline has risen to about 5 German marks a
liter, or more than $10 a gallon, while the value of the Yugoslav
dinar on the black market fell Saturday to less than one-tenth of a
mark. The cost of a liter of gasoline was about 7 dinars a week ago
and about 55 dinars Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The price of imported items like coffee also increased, but
there were plentiful stocks of cooking oil, bread and other food
products.
</P>
<P>
   At a party Saturday in a central Belgrade apartment, Dejan, a
29-year-old medical student, said that what frightened him the most
was the prospect of mobilization into the armed forces. He said he
had been ``sent an invitation to join the army reserve,'' but had
not been living at home, so the invitation could not be enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Bojan, 26, a veterinary student, said he slept in different
apartments to avoid mobilization. He also likes spending time in
different air raid shelters, because ``you meet a different class
of people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dejan complained jocularly that ``NATO only seems to bomb when
we sit down to lunch or dinner'' and added that an air raid siren
was only 50 yards from his apartment. But he said he spent time
every day telephoning friends abroad to find out more about events
than he could learn here.
</P>
<P>
   Zaklina, a 31-year-old gynecologist, said she found herself
``calmer than in peacetime.'' But life is boring with all the
alerts, she said, ``and young children and kids have a lot of
traumas, because they move them to shelters.'' She said the
Americans were ``completely crazy,'' adding, ``This is Europe and
not Iraq, and they shouldn't do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Another woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said life in
her building's shelter was now well organized, with cots assembled,
men's and women's toilets arranged, a small generator installed and
a ham radio operator entertaining nearly 100 people who gathered
there.
</P>
<P>
   Ham radio operators exchanged a lot of information but were not
careful, she said. When one operator asked, ``Is there any
indication of a nuclear attack?'' another broke in to say, ``For
God's sake, watch what you're saying.''
</P>
<P>
   When a bomb hit a missile factory or fuel depot on the edge of
Belgrade Friday night, causing a large fire, television announced
that the acrid fumes released from the fuel were not toxic, but
cautioned residents to shut their windows. In the shelter,
originally built for nuclear attack, cries went up to shut the two
heavy steel doors, while others complained that if that was done,
it would be impossible to leave the shelter to smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Later, a doctor appeared on television to tell people that
feeling sick to the stomach was a common reaction to anxiety just
now and was not necessarily a reaction to the chemical fumes. If
eyes began to burn, however, he said, people should bathe them, and
he gave instructions.
</P>
<P>
   There were also renewed attacks on a large base 10 miles
northwest of Belgrade at Batajnica. During a drive past the base
Saturday, two MIG-29s, perhaps decoys, were visible by the side of
the road, as were numerous military communication trucks and mobile
radars. Traffic was diverted from the highway, raising speculation
that the road itself might be used for takeoffs and landings.
</P>
<P>
   Near Nova Pazova, there was another MIG-29, covered with
camouflage material; numerous men who appeared to be in their
mid-50s were dressed in new military uniforms, suggesting the
mobilization of reserves, and men were putting tape on the large
display windows of an electrical goods shop.

CARDS MAY WEAR FAVORITE HAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington Redskins Coach  &UR; Norv Turner thinks a lot of pro
football publications will pick the Cardinals to win the NFC East
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the up and coming team,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that knowing the Cardinals lost starting offensive
tackle
 &UR; Lomas Brown to the Cleveland Browns in free agency and could lose
starting outside linebacker  &UR; Jamir Miller, who also is an
unrestricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   But he also thinks the Dallas Cowboys, NFC East champions last
season, would be the safer pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dallas has 10 players as good or better than anyone else at
those positions,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin, whose team knocked Dallas out of
the playoffs, thinks the Cowboys, 10-6 last season, deserve to be
the division favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dallas won it (last) year and still has the core of that
team,'' Tobin said. ``Those guys still play with a high degree of
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emmitt (running back  &UR; Emmitt Smith) &UR; had as good a year as he
has had in a while. Their offensive line still is better than most
people's offensive lines.  &UR; Deion (Sanders) is better than almost
anyone's cornerback. Who else in the division has the people they
do?''
</P>
<P>
   New York Giants Coach  &UR; Jim Fassel, former offensive coordinator
of the Cardinals, thinks the Cowboys have the advantage over the
other teams in the division because of veteran quarterback  &UR; Troy
Aikman, who has won three Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They also still have  &UR; Michael Irvin, Emmitt Smith and Deion
Sanders,'' Fassel said. ``Along with Troy, that's four potential
Hall of Famers. Nobody else has that.'' &QL; 
Close race &QL; 
Fassel thinks the NFC East race will be tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we beat Dallas in one of our two games with them, there
would have been a three-way tie for the division title last season,
but we would have been in the playoffs,'' said Fassel, whose team
swept the Cardinals and finished 8-8.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any of three teams (the Cowboys, Giants and Cardinals)
could win it. This has been a crazy division. Two years ago, a guy
gave me a frame for my wall with stories in which every
publication, 16 publications, picked us last. Nobody else was
picked last, yet we won the division.'' &QL; 
Killer schedule &QL; 
The Giants started the season 4-8 a year ago in playing a
first-place schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel knows the Cardinals, who advanced to the playoffs a year
ago with a fifth-place schedule, will be tested this season playing
one of the toughest schedules in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals play nine games against playoff teams _ Atlanta,
San Francisco, Green Bay, the New York Jets, New England Patriots,
Buffalo Bills, Miami Dolphins and two against the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the schedule came out, everybody talked about us playing
Denver, San Francisco, Green Bay and Kansas City,'' Fassel said.
``Nobody said anything about Atlanta, and they reached the Super
Bowl. With that kind of schedule, you don't get any breaks. You're
faced with being on top of your game week in and week out.'' &QL; 
Saving money &QL; 
The St. Louis Rams freed up $2.125 million by cutting former
Cardinals linebacker  &UR; Eric Hill, who signed a two-year, $5.25
million contract a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who signed a two-year deal with the Chargers on Friday,
finished the season with 86 tackles, sixth on the team. He was
effective in stopping the run on short-yardage and goal-line
situations.
</P>
<P>
   He never was a favorite of Rams Coach  &UR; Dick Vermeil, who was
upset that Hill missed much of training camp because of a back
problem. Then in the season opener against New Orleans, Hill
suffered a broken hand that affected his play for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric took a long time to get playing at the level we brought
him in to play,'' Vermeil said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Hill suffered a fractured lowered leg in the opener for
the Cardinals at Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil said he couldn't take a chance that Hill would get hurt
early in the season again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what the situation is here,'' Vermeil said. ``We've got
to win football games, and I don't want to sit around eight games
and say, `My gosh, he's still not playing well.'' &QL; 
Mock drafts &QL; 
``The Sporting News''' draft publication has the Cardinals taking
North Carolina State wide receiver  &UR; Torry Holt with the eighth pick
overall and Eastern Michigan offensive tackle  &UR; Lonnie Shelton at
No. 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pro Football Weekly's'' draft expert has the Cardinals picking
Brigham Young offensive tackle  &UR; John Tait, a Tempe McClintock High
School graduate, at No. 8 and Louisiana State defensive tackle
 &UR; Anthony
 &UR; McFarland at No. 21. &QL; 
Short shots &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay fans aren't endorsing a story in the ``Milwaukee
Journal'' ``Sentinel'' that the Packers build a domed stadium to
replace Lambeau Field in 10 to 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dome? Are you nuts?'' wrote reader  &UR; John Greene of Chippewa
Falls, Wis. ``Here's a little bit of history. No dome team has ever
won a Super Bowl. That's the way it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals players earned a combined $1.56 million during the
playoffs, $25,202 per player.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina State's Holt ran the 40-yard dash in 4.3 seconds
at his private workout on Wednesday, showing he was fully recovered
from his minor knee injury. &QL;

DUKE DARES DESTINY  
 BLUE DEVILS WIN RARE CLOSE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Were there any doubts that Duke would be
where it is now, 40 minutes removed from an NCAA championship that
resounds with inevitability?
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, there were.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State, which came into Saturday night's national
semifinal against the Blue Devils brandishing Big Ten regular
season and tournament championships, a 22-game win streak and the
No. 1 seed in the Midwest Region, was somewhat skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans believed they would have something to say about
Duke's apparent date with destiny. And they did. Lots. But in the
big picture, it still amounted to little more than a whisper,
drowned out by Duke's awesome talent. The Blue Devils held on to
win, 68-62, at Tropicana Field and move to the NCAA championship
game Monday against Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately, Duke (36-1) and UConn are the only teams to have
been ranked No. 1 in both major polls this season.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State (33-5) lived up to its tough, ornery, battling
persona, whittling a 14-point deficit early in the second half and
then pretty much outplaying the Blue Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Duke had won its past 13 games by an average of 29 points.
</P>
<P>
   When someone asked Duke guard Trajan Langdon whether the
Spartans were the ``bump in the road'' that might have been
expected, Coach Mike Krzyzewski felt compelled to jump in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait a second,'' he said. ``Michigan State is the No. 2 team
in the country (in the final regular season poll). They are not a
bump in the road. They are a great basketball team.''
</P>
<P>
   So, of course, is Duke. Few teams can withstand the type of body
shots the Spartans dish out. But few teams are like the Blue
Devils. The No. 1 seed in the East Region and the top-seeded team
in the entire tournament weathered the assault. Duke's lead shrunk
to three, but the Blue Devils never buckled and won for the 32nd
straight time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get so close,'' Michigan State point guard Mateen Cleaves
said. ``You can kind of see it. You feel yourself coming back, but
we couldn't get over the hump.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves had the type of game for which he has become known _
5-for-16 shooting, 10 assists and lots of overall court sense and
leadership. The 6-foot-2, 195-pound junior even took a charge from
Elton Brand, Duke's 6-8, 260-pound sophomore terror.
</P>
<P>
   But except for forward Andre Hutson (6 for 8), the rest of the
Spartans, like Cleaves, had trouble finding the basket. Michigan
State shot barely over 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play very good defense,'' Cleaves said. ``I think we
missed some shots we should have hit, but you do have to give Duke
credit for the defense they play.''
</P>
<P>
   Give Michigan State some credit, too. After falling behind,
34-22, with 18:37 left, the Spartans crept back. It was 51-48,
Duke, with 8:33 remaining and Brand on the bench with three fouls.
</P>
<P>
   Langdon, the Blue Devils' No. 2 scorer right behind Brand, was
having a tough game offensively. He finished with seven points. But
right there, the senior guard showed what makes him and his team
special by stepping out and hitting a three-point basket that gave
Duke a six-point lead and some breathing space.
</P>
<P>
   ``A critical, critical shot,'' Spartans Coach Tom Izzo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the biggest shot of the game,'' Krzyzewski said.
``That's why we need him.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand, with 18 points, carried most of the scoring load on his
broad back. He made 7 of 10 shots and knew when to get rid of the
ball when he was double-teamed, which was often.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he gets the ball down low, it's like he's going to score
every time,'' said Michigan State forward Antonio Smith, who fouled
out trying to guard Brand.
</P>
<P>
   Brand played much better than in the first meeting between the
teams in December in Chicago. Duke also won that one by six. Brand
had 12 points and three rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans outrebounded Duke, 41-25, in the first game, but
the Blue Devils had four more rebounds this time. They also went to
the foul line 27 times, converting only 14 attempts. Michigan State
was 6 for 11 from the line. &QL;

UCONN ENDS OHIO STATE'S TURNAROUND SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ This was strange, foreign territory for
Coach Jim Calhoun and his Connecticut Huskies. And yet, there was
something familiar about it, too.
</P>
<P>
   UConn's 64-58 win over Ohio State at Tropicana Field on Saturday
was Calhoun's 19th straight victory over Buckeyes Coach Jim
O'Brien, the prior 18 happening when O'Brien was coach at Boston
College. But that's just trivia. This is not: UConn, which never
before had appeared in a Final Four, will play for the NCAA
championship on Monday against Duke.
</P>
<P>
   UConn (33-2) relied on its usual weapons, forward Richard
Hamilton and a nasty man-to-man defense keyed by guard Ricky Moore,
to end a Buckeyes season in which they turned a last-place finish
in the Big Ten into something special in O'Brien's second season.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, the 6-foot-6 junior All-America forward, sliced and
diced the Buckeyes defense for 24 points. His last two were the
most important, a pull-up jumper with 1:42 left that extended
UConn's lead to six.
</P>
<P>
   The way Ohio State (27-9) was shooting, that would be enough.
The Huskies, who started the tournament as the No. 1 seed in the
West, held the Buckeyes to 8 for 33 (24.2 percent) in the second
half after Ohio State made half its first-half shots.
</P>
<P>
   A main Ohio State weakness, foul shooting, also was exposed as
it was 9 for 18 from the foul line.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who wears gold sneakers but for the most part sacrifices
flash for a down-and-dirty style of defense, held Scoonie Penn, the
potent Buckeyes point guard, to 11 points on 3-for-13 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Scoonie goes, so goes Ohio State,'' said Calhoun.
</P>
<P>
   Scoonie went nowhere. The Buckeyes, who came in as the fourth
seed from the South Region, went home.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, a 6-foot-2 senior, said his first objective had been
taking away Penn's drives to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Penn was a great offensive player, and he was going to
come out and attack me today,'' Moore said. ``I prepared to come
out and attack him defensively. . . . I just wanted him to shoot
tough shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn, a 5-10 junior transfer from Boston College who
orchestrated Ohio State's climb from the basement, said of Moore,
``He didn't let me breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun was even more explicit, invoking a favorite expression
to describe Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically,'' said Calhoun, ``he cut the head of the dragon
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore's teammates helped out on Penn, and they also did rather
well defending the other half of Ohio State's lethal 1-2 punch,
Michael Redd. Together, Penn and Redd had scored more than half of
Ohio State's points in the tournament. But Redd also had trouble.
The 6-6 lefty sophomore made 7 of 18 shots and scored 15 points,
his lowest output in more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hamilton, along with sophomore point guard Khalid
El-Amin, took care of the offense. Hamilton became only the second
UConn player to exceed 2,000 points in a career.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin shot a tidy 8 for 15 _ mostly by passing up long jumpers
and taking the ball to the basket _ for 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we saw the opening, we just took it,'' El-Amin said.
</P>
<P>
   Someone apparently took Penn's No. 12 jersey before the game
because he couldn't find it when he returned to the dressing room
after his pre-game warm-up. He came out wearing No. 35, ``but I
don't think that had (anything) to do with the game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   UConn opened a nine-point lead late in the first half, but the
Buckeyes closed to within one at halftime. Ohio State missed 14 of
its first 17 shots of the second half, allowing UConn to take a
51-41 lead with 11:48 to go.
</P>
<P>
   A transition basket by Redd closed the Buckeyes to within three
with 4:16 to play, but El-Amin answered with a basket in traffic.
After Ohio State made it 59-55, UConn center Jake Voskuhl nearly
lost the ball out of bounds. El-Amin had the presence of mind to
call timeout, then Hamilton scored as the shot clock was winding
down for the game's big basket. &QL;

SCOTTSDALE MAYOR FIGHTS CRITICS, SEEKS TO CARVE OUT LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two packages of nylons are crammed into the Volvo's glove box. A
bottle of hair spray is wedged between the center console and the
driver's seat. Cranberry nail polish rattles in a side pocket.
</P>
<P>
   These are more than beauty aids to Scottsdale Mayor Sam Campana,
the woman at the helm of the Valley's version of Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   They're political tools.
</P>
<P>
   Campana runs a city where image _ including the image of the
statuesque blonde known Valleywide as ``Mayor Sam'' _ is
everything, and she knows how unforgiving the public can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be mayor for a thousand days, but it's the one day
that you have a run in your nylons that they'll report it,''
Campana said.
</P>
<P>
   Behind her coiffed locks and ever-retouched nails is a woman who
knows what she wants for her city. She smiles coyly as she doggedly
takes on adversaries, from a neighboring mayor she accuses of
meddling in her city's business to residents who accuse her of
favoring developers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the woman who so carefully tends Scottsdale's image is
starting the last year of her term and launching her Campana 2000
re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   She's also in a place she never wanted to be _ on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   Campana endorses a controversial hockey arena proposal for Los
Arcos Mall in south Scottsdale. She's sparring with Phoenix Mayor
Skip Rimsza over state tax breaks for theme parks and sports
complexes. And her city is the target of federal and state probes
into alleged wrongdoing in the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Campana, 51, leads a sharply divided City Council,
and her every move is dissected by some of the most boisterous
anti-establishment forces this wealthy city has ever seen. She
struggles to shrug off high-profile flubs, including her infamous
calls to 911 for directions to city functions.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most daunting is the shadow of her beloved predecessor
looming over her. Campana marches in the boot steps of Scottsdale's
most revered figure, the late Mayor Herb Drinkwater, but she never
tries to fill them.
</P>
<P>
   She knows better than to try to compete with the legacy of a
Stetson-sporting, horseback-riding political master who could
persuade the most skeptical of foes to see things his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter who took over the reins after Herb, they would've
had a difficult time,'' said state Rep. Carolyn Allen,
R-Scottsdale, a friend of Campana for 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   So Campana works tirelessly _ past midnight most days _ to carve
her own legacy and shed stereotypes that have haunted her since she
sat on the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how hard she tries to sculpt one image of herself,
another clings to her. Observers call her a lightning rod for
mockery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Sam has done a few things that were needlessly hurtful
to herself,'' said Vern Swaback, a prominent Scottsdale architect.
``It's the Dan Quayle kind of circumstance of saying something
which is easily handled with ridicule.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when public officials face intense scrutiny, however,
the odds are stacked against Campana, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any of those stories would hang on her neck so
heavily if it weren't for the atmosphere in which we are working,''
Swaback said.
</P>
<P>
   Campana, a former tomboy from Idaho who admires ``sassy,
irreverent'' women, is proud of funneling more females into the
city's power structure. She boasts of competitiveness and
endurance, insisting she can conquer practically anything after 47
hiking trips through the Grand Canyon. She invites an elitist image
by traveling in high society and arts and cultural circles.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she exhibits a girlish fragility.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Campana took office, then-Police Chief Michael
Heidingsfeld gently scolded her for calling 911 several times to
ask for directions.
</P>
<P>
   The blunder earned her a mention on national late-night talk
shows and even sparked urban legends: During a recent convention in
Kansas City, false rumors surfaced that her hotel room number was
911. Her daily schedules, drawn up by aides, now include explicit
directions to events.
</P>
<P>
   Although privately dismayed by the public panning and stinging
nicknames (her 911ness, Mayor 911 Campana), she jokes about it
publicly.
</P>
<P>
   A carful of wayward tourists recently pulled up to City Hall and
asked her how to get to a nearby museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh no,'' Campana teased. ``You're asking ``me'' for
directions? This is a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   She's also been bedeviled by other slip-ups: She mentioned
during a council meeting that beer is not sold after the third
quarter of a hockey game. She later learned that hockey games last
three periods. A thief last year swiped a borrowed $15,000
turquoise necklace and bracelet and city-issued cellular phone. The
mayor, always in a hurry, left them on the seat of a city-owned car
in her driveway.
</P>
<P>
   And, after one day at the National League of Cities Conference
in Kansas City, Mo., she headed to New York City to shop.
</P>
<P>
   Campana shrugs off the gaffes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to,'' she said. ``I don't know everything. You can see
in a mayor's day how many opportunities there are to say the wrong
thing, make a wrong turn. Really, I'm not mistake-proof.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen said Campana is hurt when the attacks turn ``so very
personal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But she is a woman who seems to me to get up every day, she's
cheerful and optimistic by nature, and she continues to keep as
positive an attitude as anybody I know,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   Which must be difficult for a woman facing potential political
disaster to the south, to the north, and to the center of the city.
</P>
<P>
   She is head cheerleader for a proposal to build a $624 million
hockey arena, conference and entertainment complex at the failing
Los Arcos Mall at Scottsdale and McDowell roads. She has lobbied
hard for changes in a state stadium district law that would sweeten
a tax incentive for the arena complex.
</P>
<P>
   A top Smithsonian Institution official criticized Campana for
overstating the museum's involvement in a proposed $1 billion
Scottsdale redevelopment project.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury has been meeting for months to determine
whether high-level police and city officials improperly pressured
Club Tribeca, a nightclub frequented by minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the state Attorney General's Office is investigating
allegations that the City Council consistently flouts the state
Open Meeting Law. Residents have complained that the council
illegally makes decisions and discusses public business behind
closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   Critics blame Campana for explosive growth, which began under
Drinkwater's watch and has crescendoed under hers.
</P>
<P>
   When she ran for mayor in 1996, she declared growth as her top
issue. Some say she failed by continuing to allow major
developments to intensify in north Scottsdale. She supported the
unsuccessful Amberjack development on the city's largest remaining
private stretch of desert despite fierce objections to the
project's density and golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also say she offered too little too late, declaring in
her annual State of the City speech in February that she would
reduce the city's projected growth by one-third. They contend it is
developers, not the city, who are opting to put in fewer homes on
stretches of high-priced desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the mayor to take credit for what the private market has
done, when in fact they are rejecting the density that she helped
them get, really shows how myopic she is,'' said attorney Alan
Kaufman, a frequent opponent of Campana and leader of the
anti-arena effort.
</P>
<P>
   Campana defends her record, saying she has been at the forefront
of a massive, unprecedented effort to preserve thousands of acres
of the city's desert foothills.
</P>
<P>
   Preservationists also laud the mayor's support.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the tremendous success we are having in
Scottsdale, when it comes to protecting actual land for this
preserve, Sam has always been there when we needed her,'' said
Carla, executive director of the McDowell Sonoran Land Trust who
uses only her first name.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the mayor's most notable accomplishments, not
surprisingly, have involved the arts. She helped bring a traveling
Smithsonian exhibit to the empty Scottsdale Galleria in 1997, and
she has helped shape Scottsdale's new Museum of Contemporary Art.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Campana also points to polls in which Scottsdale residents
consistently have given the city and its police top ratings.
</P>
<P>
   She says her harshest critics simply do not know her.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know me as a mayor,'' Campana said, ``but they do not
know me as a mother, as an arts advocate, as a women's advocate.''
</P>
<P>
   Campana never had political goals. She grew up in Filer, Idaho _
population 800 _ and figured she'd eventually become a teacher or a
nurse, a wife, a mother. Never a mayor.
</P>
<P>
   After briefly attending a private college in Helena, Mont.,
Campana headed for Arizona with plans to teach Catholic school.
Instead, she moved into a small Scottsdale apartment and worked as
a hostess at a popular Scottsdale haunt, Reubens Restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   A regular customer at the restaurant introduced her to his
attorney, Richard Campana. Six months later, she married Richard, a
close friend of then-Mayor Drinkwater and a corporate attorney who
would eventually sit on the City Council. She was 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I married Richard, I'd never met an attorney, and I'd
never met an elected official,'' she said. ``After Richard was
(elected) to the City Council, I had to go back and ask if there
was even a mayor in Filer.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as a councilman's wife, Campana had no desire to plunge
into politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the best wife and the best mother and the best cook and
learned to cook Italian and speak it. I loved my life.''
</P>
<P>
   And although she volunteered and helped with local campaigns,
she avoided policymaking or strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women didn't do that in those days,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She stumbled onto the political scene when she and her husband
divorced in 1983. She needed a job, and Arizonans for Cultural
Development, a non-profit arts advocacy group, was looking.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they needed an executive director that knew arts and
politics, that was me,'' she said. ``They just took a chance on me,
because it really had been 15 years since I had worked.''
</P>
<P>
   She had found her passion.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of three helped launch the Scottsdale Arts Center
Association and served as a fellow for the National Endowment for
the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, she ran for City Council, eager to dip into the
political world that had become part of her home life.
</P>
<P>
   She was somewhat of a maverick in her two terms on the council,
and she got her first taste of the controversy that continues to
swirl about her.
</P>
<P>
   An audit found that Scottsdale reimbursed Campana for charges
that the city already had paid on her city-issued credit card.
Campana called the discrepancies a mistake, reimbursed the city and
completed her term.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving office, she focused on family and the arts for a
couple of years. Then Drinkwater made the shocking announcement
that he was retiring after a dozen years as Mr. Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Campana huddled with family and friends and decided to take a
stab at succeeding a legend. Drinkwater, who learned he had cancer
shortly after announcing his retirement, died Dec. 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Campana's trademark stamina sustained her through the campaign.
She stumped during the day, fixed dinner and helped her teenage son
conjugate verbs in the evening, then engaged in late-night strategy
sessions with her campaign manager, eldest daughter Cassidy, then
24.
</P>
<P>
   The mother-daughter team mounted a flashy, sophisticated
campaign. They raised more than $150,000 from powerful developers,
arts supporters and politicians, the very people who would define
the shape the city has taken on her watch. It is that dedication
and loyal cadre of supporters who, observers say, will make it
difficult to unseat Campana.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she remains as energetic as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Awake by 5:30 a.m., she treks partway up the east face of
Camelback Mountain three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day, the mayor emerged from her home sporting a
Scottsdale T-shirt, black stretch pants and a large-brimmed hat of
red cloth. She speed-walked and jogged three miles from her home
near Scottsdale Fashion Square to the base of Camelback's Cholla
Trail, all before a 7:30 a.m. breakfast meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Her days are packed with working breakfasts, public appearances,
meetings and dinner engagements. She hunkers in her office until 2
a.m. some days, skimming documents, returning calls and mulling
city business.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Sam is very focused on her health, her career, her friends,''
said Cathy Eden, a friend and former legislator who is a
Rural/Metro vice president. ``And she has enough energy for about
10 people. It's almost scary how much energy she has.''
</P>
<P>
   Campana once persuaded Eden to hike the Grand Canyon's Bright
Angel Trail with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she gets excited about something, she wants everybody
else to be excited about it,'' Eden said.
</P>
<P>
   As for her personal life, Campana is intensely private about her
long-term relationship with surgeon Lee Ansel.
</P>
<P>
   She does not hold back, however, about her kids.
</P>
<P>
   A single mother, she prides herself on the way she raised her
three children. She brags about her two daughters, who graduated
from private schools and are working in the Valley, and her son
Richie, who's preparing for college.
</P>
<P>
   She thrives on close friendships, including a small group of
women from across the country with whom she travels each year.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, she loves to shop.
</P>
<P>
   Campana says spending time with children is her favorite part of
her days. She read to kindergartners at a Scottsdale elementary
school recently, bantering with her tiny constituents and noticing
a list of guidelines on the classroom wall. One caught her eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw up there `sense of humor,' '' she told the sea of little
faces. ``That's what saves me when I'm the mayor. Sometimes when
things get so hard, I just have to have a sense of humor.'' &QL;

ABL DEMISE GIVES WNBA OPENING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE _ With the start of training camp less than seven weeks
away, the third-year WNBA has much to accomplish to capitalize on
its sole possession of the U.S. women's pro basketball market.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides expect a collective bargaining agreement between the
players' first-year union and the league to be struck by mid-April,
especially since the players lost much of their leverage with the
demise of the American Basketball League in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in a position where we're going to make six figures.
That's not reality,'' said Rebecca Lobo, one of the few players who
does earn that much as one of three marquee names around which the
WNBA was first promoted in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 average player salary of $30,000 probably will increase
minimally, but nowhere near the ABL average of $80,000, which made
that league player-friendly but accelerated its bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Other issues include improved year-round health and retirement
benefits and a limitation on the number of ABL players to be
absorbed, which the league opposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league wants the best product, but a little bit of loyalty
is owed to the women who sacrificed some,'' Lobo said.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Hunter, executive director of the National Basketball
Players Association, has attended the few bargaining sessions that
have been held.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I would like to see is (WNBA President) Val Ackerman and
someone from the union put in a room and get it done,'' said Lobo,
a forward for the New York Liberty. ``Now it's like 15 people in
the room, seven lawyers from each side and a few of us players
sitting there thinking, `What are these lawyers talking about?' ''
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of expansion teams in Orlando and Minnesota
and the possibility of a 12th roster spot _ another item under
negotiation _ the WNBA could add 34 player jobs for 144 total.
</P>
<P>
   Whether an ABL player limit (2-3 per team) is imposed, the
competitive impact of their availability on the WNBA and college
seniors will be great.
</P>
<P>
   Only Tennessee forward Chamique Holdsclaw and Alabama guard
Dominique Canty, unaccountably left off the Kodak All-America team,
are rated as first-round locks for the WNBA draft April 27.
</P>
<P>
   Teams will opt for the pro/international experience of the
former ABL players such as Yolanda Griffith (Sacramento) and
Natalie Williams (Utah), expected to be the second and third picks
after the Washington Mystics select Holdsclaw, a four-time
All-American.
</P>
<P>
   Two former ABL players, probably Katie Smith (Minnesota) and
Shannon Johnson (Orlando), are to be allocated to the expansion
teams before an expansion draft April 6.
</P>
<P>
   If so, guard Dawn Staley, who jumped from the ABL to the WNBA
late last summer, would go into the regular draft and perhaps be
available at No. 4 to Los Angeles, which covets her.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA runner-up Mercury has the 10th, 22nd, 34th and 46th
picks in the four-round draft, but as the deepest team in the
league, it first must worry about the expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the existing 10 teams will lose one player to either
Orlando or Minnesota after protecting six. Phoenix is not allowed
an exemption for Michelle Griffiths, who is pregnant and won't play
this season, so it has to decide whether to protect the Australian
forward or risk losing her in submitting its protected list
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Each expansion team already has been allocated one player:
Kristin Folkl (Minnesota) and Nykesha Sales (Orlando).
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Peck, whose Purdue team plays for the NCAA title
tonight, is moving to the pros as Orlando's coach-general manager,
while Brian Agler, coach of the two-time ABL champion Columbus
Quest, holds the same titles with Minnesota. &QL;

RAY SPEEDS TO WORLDCOM 200 MARK  
 PACK OF DRIVERS TOPS TRACK QUALIFYING BEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - There was Greg Ray. And, then, there was everyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, team owner John Menard's handpicked choice to replace
departed Pep Boys Indy Racing League poster boy Tony Stewart, was
one of nine Pep Boys Indy Racing League drivers to break the
one-lap qualifying record Saturday at Phoenix International
Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   But no one roared through the MCI WorldCom 200 proceedings as
fast as Ray.
</P>
<P>
   Ray drove as if he were being chased by a hungry wolf. He
stopped the electronic timer at 20.323 seconds, which when
converted into speed, translates into a blurry 177.139 mph lap.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Dismore, the next best qualifier, might as well have been
in an ox cart. He was about 2{ mph slower at 174.622 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Ray) keeps that up in the race, he'll lap the field,''
said Glendale's Billy Boat, who at 169.731 mph, will need
binoculars to spot Ray at the start of today's race.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a year makes. Just 12 months ago, Jeff Ward
was king of PIR's asphalt hill with a 172.753 mph lap.
</P>
<P>
   That would have put Ward in the fifth row this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fabulous,'' said Ray, who captured the first pole of his IRL
career in only his second start for Menard. ``This is what it's all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   It was what it was all about Saturday. Today what it will be
about is whose machine is faster for 200 laps, not one.
</P>
<P>
   But Ray has been conspicuously quick throughout the weekend and
has given little indication he'll run into any red lights.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is Team Menard.
</P>
<P>
   Race day always hasn't been kind to this IRL stalwart. Stewart
may have won a driving title and three races for Menard, but he
also could write a book on the number of times he's been in
position to win, only to be brought down by a balky motor or some
other stinking breakage.
</P>
<P>
   Team Menard often has been Team Tylenol.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, however, everything appears to be hunky-dory.
</P>
<P>
   Knock on wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we tested here (last month) for the `Test in the West',
Scott (Goodyear) and (Dismore) were very close to us,'' Ray said.
``Then, the conditions changed a lot (Saturday from Friday, when it
was cooler). I think our team just did a little better job of
changing with the conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   No one, however, expects Ray to keep up such a pace in the race.
Not even Ray.
</P>
<P>
   Dismore, too, is not overly discourage at the gap in qualifying
speeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I couldn't match (Ray) on a one-lap flyer,'' Dismore
said. ``But we were in our race set-up mode. I'm pleasantly
surprised. I'm a little disappointed to be in second place
three-tenths (seconds) off (Ray), but you have to look at what
tires he's on. We think he's on tires that get an incredible amount
of grip for a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel really good about my car.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear and Roberto Moreno, who's making his IRL debut,
comprise the second row.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, defending champion Scott Sharp, Donnie Beechler, Scott
Harrington, Tyce Carlson and Raul Boesel complete the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   All but Boesel bettered the old qualifying mark, but with Ray
delivering his best faster-than-a-speeding-bullet impression, it
didn't mean squat.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, Menard was all smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a totally dedicated racer,'' Menard said in a slight dig
toward Stewart, who tooks his immense talents to the NASCAR Winston
Cup circuit. ``He doesn't have a lot of other things getting in his
way. He's very focused.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I wanted somebody who was easy to work with. (Stewart)
certainly is a good racer. But we had differences as far as sponsor
dealings. He didn't like doing a lot of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, however, loved to race.
</P>
<P>
   Just like Ray, whose next trip into victory lane also will be
his first.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a driver's standpoint, I couldn't be in a better
position,'' said Ray, 36, who lives in Plano, Texas. ``It's a dream
come true.''
</P>
<P>
   A dream that could become even dreamier in a few more hours. &QL;

   SAN JOSE _ Everyone in Indiana knows Stephanie White-McCarty
colors her hair and has since she was a junior in high school.
</P>
<P>
   But then everyone in Indiana knows everything about its favorite
daughter, including the fact that she has never won a championship
at any level.
</P>
<P>
   Until tonight if No. 1-ranked Purdue (33-1) beats Purdue East,
aka Duke (29-6) with two starters and a coach who are out of the
Boilermakers plant.
</P>
<P>
   White-McCarty mania exceeds even that showered on former
collegiate scoring champion Cindy Blodgett by all of Maine,
including horrormeister Stephen King.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say her name is in the same category as Bobby
Knight, Larry Bird and God in Indiana,'' Purdue Coach Carolyn Peck
said.
</P>
<P>
   White-McCarty defers on the latter _ ``I'm definitely not like
God, let me just tell you that,'' _ and, like any good Hoosier,
takes pride in the other comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to watch other people,'' she said. ``I watched Larry
Bird, and he wasn't the most athletic, but he did a lot of things
that helped contribute to his team. Bobby Knight is a great coach,
and I like to watch his teams. They're very disciplined, they go
out and work hard every day. I like to watch a lot of players and
see the things they do on and off the floor and take from each.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly Jennifer Azzi, the Tennessee defectee who returned
to Knoxville to win a national title with Stanford in 1990. Now
White-McCarty is in Azzi's Bay territory and just one game away
from the same accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting,'' she said. ``I was talking to (teammate) Kelly
Komara because her team always beat mine in high school in the
Sweet Sixteen or the Elite Eight. It would be a great way to go
out. If it didn't happen, I think we would still realize we've done
some great things, and I've had an opportunity to play with a lot
of great players and most importantly to be around a lot of great
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially her running mate, Ukari Figgs, who stuck with Purdue
when Lin Dunn, the coach who recruited them, was fired after their
freshman season, launching a staggering talent exodus.
</P>
<P>
   Seven players were released from letters of intent, including
Michele VanGorp and Nicole Erickson, who followed former Purdue
assistant Gail Goestenkors to Duke and Summer Erb, who reached the
1998 Final Four with North Carolina State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to stay because I didn't want to leave,''
White-McCarty said. ``Brent was the main reason. I was maybe not
going to play basketball, but I was going to stay and go to school
at Purdue. Everything goes through your mind, but I wanted to be
around my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Brent McCarty, her husband, recently completed a football career
at Division III Wabash College.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came out the same year Chamique (Holdsclaw) did,'' Peck
said. ``Sometimes I think people forget that.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, more important, that it was the 5-foot-11 White-McCarty and
not the 6-2 Holdsclaw who was the consensus 1994-95 national prep
Player of the Year off a season in which she averaged 36.9 points
and 13.1 rebounds for Seeger Memorial High School in West Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw carried Tennessee to an unprecedented three
consecutive national titles and repeated this year as the
collegiate Player of the Year. But she and the Volunteers bowed out
one game shy of a fourth Final Four, returning the stage to
White-McCarty, who averages 20.5 points and 5.5 rebounds and had
the first triple-double in school history in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing because Chamique's done so much for the
game and she's a phenomenal player and a great person,''
White-McCarty said. ``She's someone you can sit down and have a
conversation with for hours. But it's exciting that we're here.
It's two new teams in the championship game.'' &QL;

NEW FACE GETS POLE FOR F2000

<P>
   PHOENIX - It was love at first sight for French Canadian
 &UR; Marc-Antoine Camirand.
</P>
<P>
   Camirand, last season's U.S. Formula 2000 Rookie of the Year, on
Saturday grabbed the pole position for today's F2000 event at
Phoenix International Raceway with a record 130 mph lap.
</P>
<P>
   Camirand missed the PIR stop last year and is making career
start No. 1 on a 1-mile oval. He did compete twice at Lowe's Motor
Speedway (Charlotte, N.C.) and at Atlanta Motor Speedway, both
1.5-mile ovals, last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try and run fast,'' Camirand said.
</P>
<P>
   Camirand was plenty fast in qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   So was  &UR; Rolando Quintanilla (128.92 mph) of Mexico, who will
share the front row with Camirand.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie  &UR; Mark E. Dismore (128.48), whose father,  &UR; Mark A.
 &UR; Dismore, will start today's Indy Racing League event from the
outside front row, qualified third fastest.
</P>
<P>
   Although both races are today, father may be too nervous to
watch son. Dismore Sr. suffered several multiple fractures in a
horrifying crash in during practice for the 1991 Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may just sit in the motorhome,'' the elder Dismore said.
``Honestly, I don't want to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Such behavior is nothing new to the younger Dismore, who is 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in Go-Kart, he never really liked watching,'' the son
said. ``I know he'll be a jumble of nerves.''
</P>
<P>
   The older Dismore, however, did give his son plenty of help in
his search to find the quickest route around the oval.
</P>
<P>
   ``He helped me a lot with (finding the lines),'' the younger
Dismore said. ``If not for (my dad), I don't think I would have
qualified third.'' &QL; 
Pit stops &QL; 
Five NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series drivers ( &UR; Ron Hornaday,
Jack &UR; Sprague, Rick Carelli, Joe Ruttman and  &UR; Butch Miller) have
competed in every truck race (99) since the circuit's inception. If
one of them wins next week's race at Evergreen (Wash.) Speedway, he
will receive a $100,000 bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone will put $10,000 in the pocket of every Indy Racing
League driver leading Lap 99 at races this season. There's one
catch. The driver has be running with Firestone rubber.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rusty Wallace, whose little brother,  &UR; Mike, won the NASCAR
Winston West race, will sign autographs Monday from 2 p.m. to 4
p.m. at Action Performance Companies Inc., at 4707 E. Baseline
Road. &QL;

HORNADAY TAKES HIS TIME, TAKES 1ST  
 GRABS LEAD LATE ON SMART MOVE WITH PIT CREW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DEWAYNE SMITH  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - After his win Saturday in the Chevy Trucks NASCAR 150
at Phoenix International Raceway, Ron Hornaday said he felt he was
home again.
</P>
<P>
   He should feel at home.
</P>
<P>
   Although the California native, who resides in Mooresvile, N.C.,
had only one Craftsman Truck Series win under his belt at Phoenix
before Saturday, he has long been a local favorite since his days
doing battle in Southwest Tour and Winston West stock-car circuits
on the one-mile layout.
</P>
<P>
   Hornaday, the truck series' two-time champion and winningest
driver with 24 victories, started fifth and didn't go to the front
until lap 79, the last of five drivers to run out front.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last restart was very important,'' said Hornaday, who
pilots the NAPA Auto Parts Chevrolet owned by Winston Cup champion
Dale Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a clear track ahead of me while the others were caught
up together and had to race.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornaday, who stayed on the track during a two-lap caution to
pick up the lead, had received left-side tires and fuel during a
previous caution for laps 63 through 69.
</P>
<P>
   The finish was nearly a replay of last spring's Craftsman Truck
Series battle when Hornaday, 40, scored his first truck victory at
PIR. He finished ahead of second-place Jack Sprague of Spring Lake,
Mich., after the two swapped paint in a major battle.
</P>
<P>
   Although the door-to-door battle didn't materialize this time,
Sprague, who started from the pole, didn't have enough truck to
overhaul Hornaday after being penalized a lap for jumping the
restart on the first caution period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a bad mistake on the restart and passed on the left
side before the start/finish line,'' said Sprague, who drives the
GMAC Financial Services Chevrolet. ``I just dummied up.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprague, who like Hornaday, jumped into a Winston West stock car
to finish fourth after the truck event, has had lots of success at
PIR, winning three consecutive races in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague credits his crew with his finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were off sequence (pit stops) all day and each time we
would have to go all the way to the back and come all the way back
up again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then about 20 laps to go I got into the wall because of the
stuff on the windshield and I couldn't see a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   With his spring battle still in mind, Hornaday wasn't about to
count out Sprague despite all his hardships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't write Jack Sprague off when he went a lap down,''
said Hornaday. ``If he wants it back, he'll get it back. He races
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of about 13,000 was treated to an opening-lap
spectacle not often seen at PIR as three cars came down the front
straight side by side.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague, second-place starter Rick Crawford of Mobile, Ala., and
third-place starter Kevin Harvick of Bakersfield, Calif., were door
handle to door handle at the end of the first lap.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Houston of Hickory, N.C., made it an all-Chevrolet top
three finish when he placed third in his Cat Rental Store-sponsored
mount. He did his best to overhaul Hornaday from lap 79 until
Sprague passed him on lap 125.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we had a wicked start,'' said Houston about his run
from his 12th place starting position. ``We got out of sync (pit
stops), but it actually worked out well.''

COLORADO RIVER IS OPTION FOR ANGLERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Arizona Game and Fish Department obviously is
aware that there are going to be problems for anglers because of
extremely dry conditions.
</P>
<P>
   San Carlos, Horseshoe and Roosevelt lakes will be hit badly. The
first two may dry up.
</P>
<P>
   And there'll be real problems in the mountains. Few lakes
probably will go dry, but many of them may get so low that weed
growth, which helps rob the water of oxygen, and warm water may
threaten trout. Forget all but a few streams. There won't be much
flowing.
</P>
<P>
   After a three-year drought that culminated in 1986, a few lakes
went dry, boat ramps didn't reach the water and even mountain lakes
weren't exempt. Deer populations continued to decline because of
unfavorable weather conditions. Last year, the number of permits
declined to a record low. There were few quail, again because of
drought.
</P>
<P>
   Game and Fish was hit hard. It's financial base has no state tax
money. It's financed primarily by license sales. It gets some
Heritage Fund money and some federal excise taxes on the sale of
sporting goods.
</P>
<P>
   The number of anglers purchasing fishing licenses dropped
drastically. Hunting licenses did the same.
</P>
<P>
   It's worse this year, and Game and Fish faces a real financial
problem. But at least it's being more aggressive this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people can't fish here, they will somewhere else,'' said
Larry Riley, fisheries chief for the department. ``We need to
direct them to other kinds of fishing _ places they don't normally
fish here in the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those areas is the Colorado River.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, Wyoming and Utah also have had less snowpack than
usual, but it's not as bad as in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service has estimated that those states
have 88 percent of normal snowpack and that spring runoff is at 84
percent, with more snow possible. That's a lot better than Arizona,
which may face its driest year ever.
</P>
<P>
   Releases at Glen Canyon Dam, which backs up Lake Powell, have an
average flow now of about 14,000 cubic feet per second. In April
and May the average releases should by about 12,000 cfs.
</P>
<P>
   That should translate into fairly good lake levels from Powell
to Yuma.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Mead had two good years of water, and pro fishermen say it
is the best fishing they've ever seen there.
</P>
<P>
   The high lake levels from the wet years flooded brush and trees
at Mead, producing huge crops of bass and forage fish. Expect many
2- to 5-pound largemouth this year with plentiful striped bass.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Mohave, which is remote with few places to launch, will get
little pressure once you get a few miles away from Davis Dam. The
catch rate isn't as good as other lakes on the river, but the
striped bass and largemouth sizes often are better. And there's no
competition for places to fish.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, of course, will be good. Anything from walleye to
smallmouth bass to striped bass should be good.
</P>
<P>
   And just below it's dam, the 16 miles of tailwater trout fishery
called Lees Ferry already is excellent and could continue through
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be hot _ Lees Ferry is like a pizza oven with the cliffs
of Glen Canyon radiating _ but the cold water makes in more than
bearable.
</P>
<P>
   With problems on the desert lakes causing doubts, the Colorado
River would be a good alternative. &QL; 
Urban lake popular &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The state's urban fishing program has been popular for years. It
allows urbanites to fish close to home.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the lakes are stocked with catfish during the summer
and rainbow trout in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   But when an urban lake was established a year ago in the low
mountains at Payson, its use exceeded expectations.
</P>
<P>
   A seasonal fishery was set up in Green Valley Lakes. Last year,
the department stocked 9,000 trout into the lake from October
through May. There is no catfish stocking.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Swanson, the Game and Fish biologist in charge of the
program, said youth use of the lake was much higher than
anticipated. The lake is used primarily by Payson residents, but
there is growing use by Phoenix area residents. &QL;

DEATH MARS TRACK OPENING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAN LEE  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE, Calif. -- The opening of the Irwindale Speedway was
marred Saturday afternoon by the death of a race car driver on the
track, just hours before inaugural ceremonies were to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Diemert, 23, was driving around the track when the
accident occurred, Irwindale police Lt. Rick Woodmansee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently he was making laps and crashed in turn four,''
Woodmansee said Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Diemert was extracted from the wreck and airlifted to Arcadia
Methodist Hospital with head injuries at about 2:15 p.m.,
Supervising County Fire Dispatcher Diana Aronson said.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, an Oregon resident, was pronounced dead on arrival
at the hospital, Woodmansee said. There was no estimate on how fast
he was traveling at the time of the crash, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Powell, a Salt Lake City resident who owns a car competing
this weekend at the speedway, said she witnessed the accident. It
appeared that Diemert hit another car and then slammed into the
wall near the ticket sales and administration office, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit (the wall) twice and ended up upside down,'' Powell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other witnesses confirmed Powell's account, saying Diemert tried
to avoid a stalled car in turn three before hitting the wall twice.
</P>
<P>
   The brand new white wall around the race track was scarred by
black marks near the place where Powell said the accident occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred before the spectator gates opened. Despite
the crash, the scheduled 6 p.m. inaugural ceremonies -- which
featured local elected officials, fireworks and the USC marching
band -- went ahead without any mention of the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason, because it happened much earlier during
practice,'' speedway spokesman Doug Stokes said. ``It's very
unfortunate that it happened on the first day of the first race.''
</P>
<P>
   A capacity crowd of enthusiastic auto racing fans filled the
6,500-seat grandstand, with most unaware of the tragedy. Families
brought blankets to ward off the chilly breeze that left the white
``Irwindale Speedway'' flags fluttering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a clean track,'' Cerritos racing fan Rod
Masselink said as he waited outside the grandstand for a friend.
``It looks like they went first class.''
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Fulmer, a Glendora resident who has helped organize a
race car series that will compete on the track, said she thought
the speedway was wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all good seats,'' Fulmer said, referring to the
grandstand. ``You can see the whole track.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Shireman, another Glendora resident who works with Fulmer
on the racing series, agreed, saying seats at the oval speedway
track are better than the seats at the larger California Speedway
in Fontana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those seats bite, because you can't see the back
straightaway,'' he said. Shireman added that it will be far more
convenient to get to the Irwindale Speedway than some of the other
places race car fans go to around California.
</P>
<P>
   Both Shireman and Fulmer said they believe there's a lot of
support for auto racing in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the stands,'' Fulmer said. ``People have been waiting
for a facility like this. I think racing's coming back.''

DUKE SURVIVES A SCARE 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG. Fla. _ For 18 tantalizing seconds, Michigan
State had a chance, a good chance, the chance so many thought would
never come. When Charlie Bell hit two free throws with 8:33
remaining, pulling the Spartans within three points, the improbable
seemed possible.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State's supporters roared, Duke's fans grew silent, and
the ghosts of upsets past whisked through Tropicana Field like a
cool breeze.
</P>
<P>
   And then, Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing but Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Too much Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Trajan Langdon punctured Michigan State's momentum with a
cold-blooded 3-pointer, William Avery drained another, and within
minutes the relentless, unforgiving Blue Devils were in command.
Game, set, semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts a dagger in your heart when you make a run and they
hit a shot like that,'' Bell said after Duke's 68-62 victory
Saturday in front of 41,340 fans.
</P>
<P>
   A few yards away, in a corner of the stadium, Connecticut's
players and fans watched the Blue Devils secure their 37th victory,
tying the NCAA record. As the final obstacle in Duke's pursuit of
immortality, they should be afraid, very afraid.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State played a great second half. It executed its
offense, it played superb defense, and it contested every rebound
and loose ball. But the Spartans weren't perfect, and that was the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Against Duke, there's no such thing as margin for error. Great
isn't good enough, and the chances of Connecticut playing a perfect
game are slimmer than Ally McBeal.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Michigan State's physical, grinding style is a natural
antidote for Duke's open-court mastery, Connecticut plays at Duke's
pace, and that's asking for a beating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The type of game and the type of team we played (Saturday)
makes it even more worthwhile,'' Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said.
``It was really as fulfilling a win as we've had all year because
they're so good.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Michigan State may have given Connecticut a
blueprint for containing the Blue Devils. Instead of double-teaming
Elton Brand underneath and leaving open Duke's 3-point shooters,
the Spartans played a standard man-to-man against Brand and
shadowed Langdon, Avery and Shane Battier on the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the decision not to double-team (Brand) a lot,''
Michigan State coach Tom Izzo said. ``It's a matter of picking your
poison. You want to get killed inside or get killed outside? We'd
rather give up two than three.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked. Duke shot 30.8 percent from 3-point range _ 10
percent below normal _ and Langdon was limited to three baskets.
Brand was exquisite with 18 points and 15 rebounds, but he couldn't
do it alone. When he charged into Mateen Cleaves for his fourth
foul with 10 minutes left, the Spartans responded as if granted a
stay.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Hutson scored from the low post, Morris Peterson tipped in
an errant free throw and Bell hit two from the line. It was 51-48
Duke, and the Trop, as locals call it, was rocking.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel it, you feel it coming back,'' Cleaves said. ``We got
so close, but we couldn't get over that hump.''
</P>
<P>
   With Brand on the bench and the game within reach, Michigan
State's Jason Klein missed a 3-pointer, then Cleaves traveled and
missed a jumper. Against anyone else, the Spartans could have
survived the miscues. But Duke pounced with back-to-back 3-pointers
and Avery's runner in the lane.
</P>
<P>
   Soon it was 59-50, then 64-52, and the Blue Devils were a game
from their crown.

RUSSIA SWEEPS WORLD AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
 FIGURE SKATING-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELSINKI _ She was pumping her fist in triumph before the music
even stopped. Maria Butyrskaya knew the only way she wouldn't win
the world figure skating title here Saturday was if she fell splat
on her bottom _ twice.
</P>
<P>
   So when she ended her four minutes upright and unflawed inside
Hartwall Areena, Butyrskaya knew she'd made history. No Russian
woman had ever won the global crown, and no country had ever won
all four titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's going on . . . I don't even know how I
skated,'' babbled the 26-year-old Butyrskaya after she had
dethroned two-time champion Michelle Kwan, who climbed out of
fourth to salvage the silver medal ahead of Julia Soldatova, the
17-year-old Russian.
</P>
<P>
   Butyrskaya's victory capped a marvelous week for the Motherland,
which also claimed the men's (Alexei Yagudin), pairs (Elena
Berezhnaya-Anton Sikharulidze), and dance (Anjelika Krylova-Oleg
Ovsyannikov) titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done this many times in Europeans, but we didn't
believe it was possible in Worlds,'' said Elena Tchaikovskaya, who
coaches both Butyrskaya and Soldatova. ``But now, you see, we take
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The stumbling block had always been the women, who had won only
four world medals until last year. But once the Russians stopped
diverting promising girls into pairs and dance, their Moscow-based
women's team blossomed. Russia now has the deepest program on the
planet. Viktoria Volchkova finished 10th Saturday and the Russians
left two world-class women home in defending silver medalist Irina
Slutskaya and Elena Sokolova.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they weren't counting on gold here, not after
Uzbekistan's Tatiana Malinina beat Butyrskaya a fortnight ago at
the Grand Prix final in St. Petersburg. And they'd seen little of
Kwan, who skipped the Grand Prix season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We planned to take two medals, but we don't know how looks
Kwan,'' said Tchaikovskaya. ``When we come here, we see she is in
not-so-good form.''
</P>
<P>
   When the defending champ, congested and woozy, began missing
jumps in practice, the Russians began dreaming about a golden
sweep. When Kwan crashed on a double axel in Friday's short
program, they stopped worrying about her and started worrying about
Butyrskaya, who has a history of folding when the global spotlight
comes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``How this fantastic woman, this fantastic skater could not do
in performance _ it is nonsense,'' said Tchaikovskaya. So
Tchaikovskaya went to work on her pupil's fragile psyche and a
bolder, more confident Butyrskaya emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day by day, was work,'' Tchaikovskaya said. ``But she now
believes she can do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Butyrskaya's recent bare-bottomed pose in the Russian
edition of Playboy was her symbolic breakthrough, but she was a
different skater once she survived a shaky qualifying round here.
And so was Kwan, who admitted that she let her illness get into her
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cold probably hit harder mentally than physically,'' she
said. ``My confidence level was a little down.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwan came here hoping to be the first woman since Katarina Witt
to win three titles in four years. But once she went splat in the
short program, Kwan was hoping just to stay on the awards podium.
And Butyrskaya knew she had a priceless cushion.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan couldn't win unless the Russian finished third in the long
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous,'' Butyrskaya conceded, ``but I knew I could be
second and still win.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Butyrskaya skated cleanly with only sixth-place Anna
Rechnio of Poland remaining, she knew she had the title. But Kwan,
waiting backstage, didn't know she was finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the dressing room with the door shut,'' she said. ``I
heard a lot of screaming, but I didn't hear the marks.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter, Kwan decided when she took the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about winning or losing,'' she told herself. ``It's
about skating.''
</P>
<P>
   Her skating was far from perfect _ Kwan did a sloppy triple lutz
combination and singled her double axel _ but her artistry was
enough to lift her into second place and a fourth consecutive world
medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a rough week for me, a lot of ups and downs,'' Kwan
said. ``But I'm really proud of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Her silver plus a remarkable seventh-place finish by 13-year-old
Sarah Hughes were enough to assuage the Americans' worst fears _
that they would lose a spot for next year's event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a blast out there, a party on the ice,'' exulted Hughes,
the youngest skater in the field.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the Russians who were popping the champagne at day's
end, toasting the woman who enabled them to run the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we won't give the title away any more,'' Butyrskaya
mused.

 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ On May 29, International Boxing Federation welterweight
champion Felix Trinidad will defend his title on HBO against former
IBF junior middleweight champion Vincent Pettway at Roberto
Clemente Stadium in Puerto Rico. Pettway is the IBF's No. 1-rated
welterweight, so the fight is a mandatory defense, one Trinidad
cannot avoid without losing his title and one HBO must televise or
lose its contractual hold on Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   The show must go on, all sides say, and so it will, but in truth
this is no mandatory title defense at all. It is a mandatory
mismatch, to be kind _ a mandatory execution, to be accurate. The
Vincent Pettway who will enter that ring in San Juan is no more the
No. 1 welterweight in the world than you are.
</P>
<P>
   Well shop-worn at 33, according to experts, he is not the
Pettway who was once junior middleweight champion, and how he
became the IBF's No. 1 contender for the 147-pound title is
difficult to fathom, impossible to logically explain, and
illustrative of the ills that are eating away at boxing's
credibility and moving the sport closer and closer to a federal
takeover that would be welcome by many who love it.
</P>
<P>
   This is an old story that has been repeated for decades and one
not meant to demean Pettway, who has had a long and admirable
career. It is simply a story the public needs to hear to understand
how boxing is too often run these days.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis heavyweight
unification debacle that ended with Holyfield losing to Lewis but
retaining his title when the fight was scored a draw, many things
have been written and said about boxing. There has been much
speculation about judges being paid off and fights being fixed. A
week ago in this corner, an attempt was made to show how judges and
referees are influenced not by payoffs but by the simple fact that
they work at the pleasure of boxing's three crime families _ the
IBF, World Boxing Council, and World Boxing Association _ and have
their fees and expenses taken care of by promoters. Either can
freeze an official out of work, so when they have such power, there
is no need to bribe them.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say it never happens or to argue that such
influence-peddling is not bribery by a different name. It is just
to make clear that how it's done today is difficult to prove.
</P>
<P>
   The fact of the matter is, far more college basketball games
than prizefights have been fixed in the past four decades. More
college basketball games have been fixed by Boston College players
alone, as a matter of fact, than by promoters like Don King, yet no
one doubts that Monday night's NCAA championship game will be on
the up and up regardless of what odd thing might happen. But the
same benefit of the doubt seldom goes to boxing when problems arise
and never when they arise in a fight promoted by King.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to argue that boxing has a higher moral standing
than college basketball (although if you've been watching what's
been going on at Minnesota over the last decade, maybe so). It is
just to point out that the way fights get fixed today is not to pay
someone to take a dive but simply to make matches like Trinidad vs.
Pettway, Roy Jones Jr. vs. Ricky Frazier, Oscar De La Hoya vs.
Patrick Charpentier, and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   The chief culprits in this shabby exercise of mandatory
mismatches designed to take care of favored promoters are the
people responsible for rating fighters and sanctioning title
matches. The IBF is no more guilty of this (and no less so) than
the WBC or the WBA, but it is the one that made Pettway No. 1, so
it is as good a fight as any to use as an example.
</P>
<P>
   Pettway is a 33-year-old former world champion with a 42-6-1
record. On the surface he would appear far more legitimate a
challenger than many who have preceded him, but that's part of the
trick. If an organization is smart, it doesn't put a Charpentier in
as No. 1, as the WBC did. Rather, it puts in a guy with good
pedigree who is no longer fit competition for an elite fighter.
</P>
<P>
   When HBO accepted the bout, senior vice president Lou DiBella,
who signed off on it, knew Pettway had a decent record and was a
former world champion. What he didn't know, and frankly couldn't do
anything about even if he did, was that the IBF's mandatory
challenger for one of the best punchers in the world had been
stopped by Paul Vaden on Aug. 12, 1995, 11 months after first
winning the junior middleweight title. Pettway was then stopped by
Terry Norris in a WBC-WBA title fight six months later. Since that
fight on Feb. 24, 1996, here is what Pettway has done to convince
the IBF he is the No. 1 welterweight contender in the world:
</P>
<P>
   --Moved down from 154 pounds to 147, the welterweight limit.
</P>
<P>
   --Won a 10-round decision three months after the Norris loss
from Benji Singleton, a fighter with a career record of 20-46-4 who
is 7-28-3 since he fought Pettway.
</P>
<P>
   --Stopped a fighter named Harold Bennett five months later, on
Oct. 23, 1996. Bennett's record is 18-20-2; he was knocked out in
his last four fights and seven of his last 11 dating back to the
Pettway match.
</P>
<P>
   --Did not fight for 14 months after the Bennett win, then
captured a 10-round decision from Gerald Reed, a fighter with a
15-24-3 record.
</P>
<P>
   So drained by this experience, Pettway needed another 14 months
off before he faced Reed a second time on Feb. 6 of this year,
again winning a 10-round decision from a guy who is now 4-20-3 in
his last 27 fights.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, did I mention that Pettway just happens to be promoted by
King?
</P>
<P>
   The last fact seems to be the only way Pettway became a
contender again, although Darrell Peoples, chairman of the IBF
Ratings Committee, did his best to argue otherwise Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Said Peoples, ``Pettway is a former IBF champion with a good
record.'' So is Larry Holmes, but does that make him the No. 1
heavyweight in the world?
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Pettway was due to fight Trinidad and stepped aside
or what have you (to allow the Trinidad-Pernell Whitaker fight),''
Peoples continued. ``Let me explain this to you. We can only rate
those people we receive information on and as far as it goes,
Pettway has a good record and has been staying active.''
</P>
<P>
   Staying active is one criterion by which the IBF says it rates
its fighters, but not everyone would consider a guy who's had two
fights with the same stiff in the past 28 months active. Joe Louis
hasn't been much more active the past 28 months and he's been dead
since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the IBF recently adopted a policy that said you could not
become the No. 1 contender without beating another ranked fighter.
The IBF keeps its No. 1 ranking vacant now after a fighter holding
the ranking loses a fight. When two ranked fighters meet, the
winner vaults into that slot. That is how young Fernando Vargas
became the IBF junior middleweight champion. First he beat Anthony
Stephens to become No. 1 and then destroyed Yory Boy Campas for the
title. That is how the system is supposed to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made that policy change because guys were moving up through
attrition instead of fighting,'' said Peoples. ``We wanted to
justify our No. 1 ranking by seeing the guy beat someone else in
our ratings, someone in the top 15. We adopted that in the last
year or so, so I guess Pettway got to No. 1 before we adopted the
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't think so, because 18 months ago Pettway was 10 months
into his first 14-month layoff, which not even the IBF could
construe as active. If the time frame was only a year ago, Pettway
was two months removed from his first win over the never-ranked
Reed, nearly two years removed from having faced a rated fighter,
and nearly four years removed from having beaten a rated fighter
(Simon Brown in 1995).
</P>
<P>
   So how'd he become No. 1?
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at his record and he didn't even fight a stiff in
1998,'' a well-known matchmaker said. ``There's a dozen young
welterweights you've never heard of who deserve that ahead of
Pettway but they aren't promoted by Don King.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a champion who isn't much, who's unknown himself
like half these guys, you can get away with this kind of stuff. But
when you have a high-profile champion, you can't have an unknown
No. 1 who can't fight, like Charpentier, or a shot one like
Pettway. Pettway had a legitimate career. He was a world champion
for a while, but he's a shot, shot guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But TV has to accept the fight because it's a mandatory and
then the public sees a mismatch that lasts a round or two and it
hurts boxing more.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are simply the facts of one sad case and the facts of life
for one sad sport.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to force a rapid rematch between Lewis and Holyfield
have predictably slowed; it now appears a November date is likely.
The fighters have agreed to accept $15 million each, and King is
still saying the bout can be made for September but Lewis's
promoters disagree. Panos Eliades and Dino Duva have begun to
explore sites in Great Britain, either the new Millennium Stadium
in Cardiff, Wales, that was just built to house the rugby World Cup
in October, or Ibrox Park, home of the Glasgow Rangers soccer club
in Scotland. Millennium Stadium has a roof, so it is a possibility
for an outdoor fight if the bout could be made by October. But Las
Vegas remains the leading candidate because whoever promotes the
fight will need a huge site fee to cover the purses of Holyfield
and Lewis. Who promotes it could be a sticking point as well. King
holds a contract saying he is to promote any rematch, but Duva is
claiming he had so many problems in the first fight that King will
have to accept a fee and let him do the promotion. That is
unlikely, even though other boxing chieftains believe it will be
difficult to legitimize the outcome if King is the promoter.
Lastly, HBO has yet to agree to any financial deal, although one
will come eventually because neither fighter has anybody else to
fight that the public would accept until the issue between them is
settled . . . Holyfield showed the kind of fighter he has always
been by agreeing to a $5 million pay cut within days after the
first fight. Say what you will of him, he did the same thing to get
his shot at Mike Tyson, taking $4 million less than the Duvas were
insisting on when they still represented him. That is the
difference between him and Lewis and why he fought every major
heavyweight of his time while Lewis had faced none until Holyfield.
Lewis's people were never willing to risk short-term money for
long-term gain, so he did not fight Riddick Bowe, George Foreman,
or Tyson. Holyfield fought, and beat, all of them . . . Holyfield,
by the way, told the BBC last week that he would not admit he'd
lost to Lewis. ``We both did not do enough to be called undisputed
champion,'' he said. ``It wasn't a great day for me, but I got
through it.'' . . . As much as I love Muhammad Ali, how could he
call Holyfield-Lewis ``the biggest fix in fight history''? He
fought Ken Norton three times and hasn't beaten him yet but got two
wins. And ask Jimmy Young if he truly lost his fight to Ali. The
people who write these letters and put Ali's name on them should be
a little more careful how they use the greatest fighter in history.

COACH K: ROLL TAPE AND REBOUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Duke prepared for Michigan State with two
words: Roll tape.
</P>
<P>
   When the teams met Dec. 2 in the Great Eight in Chicago,
Michigan State outrebounded the Blue Devils 41-25 and grabbed an
astounding 25 offensive rebounds. Although Duke survived 73-67,
coach Mike Krzyzewski worried that a repeat rebounding performance
Saturday night could fuel a Final Four upset.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Krzyzewski ordered Duke's video team to make
a tape of Michigan State's offensive rebounds. Then he showed it to
the players and emphasized rebounding in practice every day.
</P>
<P>
   They got the point.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils outrebounded Michigan State by four Saturday in
their 68-62 victory. What's more, they grabbed 28 of the 46
rebounds available on their defensive end. Yes, Michigan State got
second shots _ 22 second-chance points, to be exact _ but it did
not get enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach made it a point of interest to get on the boards and
block out,'' said Duke center Elton Brand, who had 15 rebounds.
``We did.''
</P>
<P>
   Backcourt battle: Connecticut guards Khalid El-Amin and Richard
Hamilton are usually the most talked-about backcourt in any game
they play. But this week, Ohio State's tandem of Scoonie Penn and
Michael Redd got most of the attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our pride stepped up a little bit,'' El-Amin said.
``We felt threatened that they were trying to outdo us.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton and El-Amin dominated in the Huskies' 64-58 victory.
They combined for 42 points (66 percent of Connecticut's total)
while Redd and Penn combined for 26 points (45 percent of the team
total).
</P>
<P>
   A look ahead: Duke and Connecticut haven't met since 1995, when
the Huskies won 90-86 on a neutral court.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Blue Devils are 3-0 against Connecticut in NCAA
Tournament play, including an Elite Eight win in 1990 and a Sweet
16 victory in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``One assistant coach has been assigned to Duke for two days,
and one assistant has been assigned to Michigan State for two
days,'' Huskies coach Jim Calhoun said. ``We've done a lot. We
already have a breakdown.''
</P>
<P>
   They'll need it.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: When the Buckeyes arrived in St. Petersburg,
Penn's No. 12 jersey was missing. He wore No. 35 instead.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun has defeated Ohio State coach Jim O'Brien in 19
consecutive games, dating to O'Brien's tenure at Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State and Connecticut combined for 122 points _ the lowest
total for a national semifinal since the shot clock was introduced
in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Duke is 32-6 in tournament play in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1993 (North Carolina-Michigan), two No.
1 seeds will meet in the championship game.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in Division I history, the men's and women's
teams from the same school will play for the national title.
(Duke's women play Purdue today in San Jose.)
</P>
<P>
   Only one school in any division has won the men's and women's
titles in the same year: Central Missouri State, a Division II
team, in 1984.

WILLIAMS READY TO SHOW HIS STUFF 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Despite the things you've heard about Heisman Trophy
winner Ricky Williams ``sliding'' down in the draft, there will be
a standing-room-only crowd of NFL scouts at his private workout
Tuesday in San Diego, because all of that supposed ``sliding'' can
be erased with one sizzling 40 time, which the 244-pound Williams
may well be primed to produce.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what you hear about quarterbacks Tim Couch,
Donovan McNabb, Daunte Culpepper, and Akili Smith, Williams is seen
by most scouts as one of the two best players, regardless of
position, in the draft _ the other being Georgia cornerback Champ
Bailey. That's why Indianapolis general manager Bill Polian, who is
on record saying he hates private workouts, will be in San Diego
even though he has Marshall Faulk in his backfield.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk has rushed for more than 1,000 yards four times in his
five NFL seasons, yet Williams is so talented that the Colts could
end up trading Faulk to draft him with the fourth pick on the first
round. Or they might trade the pick to someone who wants Williams
badly enough to pay a king's ransom for the right to pay Williams a
king's ransom.
</P>
<P>
   The latter would seem more likely, and there is no shortage of
suitors, yet the fact that Polian will attend Williams's workout
has given some draft watchers cause to wonder about Indianapolis's
true intentions. A year ago, the only individual workout Polian
attended was Peyton Manning's; this year only Williams and Bailey
(last week) were on his agenda, although his scouts have fanned out
across the country to attend many others.
</P>
<P>
   Why would Polian bother looking at Williams when he already has
Faulk? Ask Saints coach Mike Ditka, who went on record during the
NFL owners' meetings offering to trade his entire draft (six picks)
to move up and get the Texas All-American and now reportedly has
sweetened the offer to either the Colts or the Eagles (who pick
second) with two more high picks _ possibly including his No. 1 _
from the 2000 draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a big difference-maker right away,'' Ditka said
in Phoenix. ``(Texas coach) Mack Brown told me he's Earl Campbell
with speed. He said he's the best football player he's ever seen.
That's a pretty good statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a special player who comes out only once in a
while, like Campbell was, like Walter Payton was.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditka coached Payton in Chicago, so he has first-hand knowledge
of greatness in running backs, and his opinion on Williams is
shared by many despite the somewhat off-putting manner with which
Williams handled himself at the combine. He came in 19 pounds
overweight, refused to work out, left early, and was less than
cooperative with the staff. He also raised a few eyebrows among the
old white men who run the NFL when he showed up surrounded by a
crew of would-be rap singers.
</P>
<P>
   Some teams are concerned about Williams's decision to sign on
with Master P as his representative rather than a more conventional
sports agent, but his contract actually will be handled by Leland
Hardy and Andy Curtain, two agents certified by the NFL Players
Association. (By the way, Master P earned $56.5 million last year
from No Limit Records, so he must know a thing or two about
managing money, if not necessarily young football players.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, veteran agent Ed Cunningham recently sent an e-mail to
Williams's mother saying he believed her son's value was dropping
because of his association with Master P and his rapper friends,
even though Williams was exemplary on and off the field last year
at Texas as he broke Tony Dorsett's all-time college rushing
record.
</P>

   Perhaps to set some minds at ease, Williams reversed himself
after saying he would not do any workouts before the draft,
agreeing to Tuesday's session at which he will run the 40, lift
weights, do the vertical leap, and run other drills. He also
decided to meet with interested teams April 7-9 for personal
interviews, as many college players do.
</P>
<P>
   One team that says it isn't ready to trade up for Williams is
the Rams, who could use a productive back after being badly burned
when they drafted troubled Nebraska runner Lawrence Phillips two
years ago. Coach Dick Vermeil said it would not be best for his
team. That's easy for him to say _ even though his leading rusher a
year ago was June Henley, who gained only 313 yards after starting
the year on the practice squad _ because Vermeil should be in
position to grab Miami's Edgerrin James, the draft's consensus
second-best back, with the sixth pick.
</P>
<P>
   The team you should most want to see get into this race is right
down the road in Foxborough. Even if three quarterbacks go at the
top of the draft, as some experts predict, the Colts still seem
more likely to take Southern Cal linebacker Chris Claiborne or
trade the pick than to go for Williams because they have so many
needs more glaring than running back. If a trade is their
inclination, and the Patriots are smart, New England should
consider packaging its two first-round choices and whatever else it
takes to move up and get Williams.
</P>
<P>
   With his size and speed, Williams may be the only kind of back
who can excel with New England's suspect run blocking because he
can make yards on his own. When you also consider what New England
has gotten out of the 19 picks it made the past two years, quality
seems more important than quantity, and Williams certainly
represents quality at a position where there are only two
high-profile players available.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of slow but steady decline, Bob Kraft's team
needs to make a bold move next month if it is to stay in the
running for the Super Bowl trophy he covets. Certainly their offer
would have to be a blockbluster because the Colts, for obvious
reasons, would rather see Williams running in New Orleans than New
England.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots must find out what Polian's price is _ and exceed
it, if necessary _ because they're not going anywhere with Sedrick
Shaw carrying the ball. Or Darick Holmes, either.
</P>
<P>

   In case you're keeping score, Master P is the fourth music
industry type to try his hand at the sports agent business. MC
Hammer, Sean ``Puff Daddy'' Combs, and Def Jam founder Russell
Simmons all got in. And got out. But Master P's No Limit Sports
Management has also signed four NBA players, including Boston's Ron
Mercer, who were previously handled by some of the most respected
agents in the NBA . . . Here's how things have changed for the
worse in sports. The presidents of the Rams and Chiefs, as well as
the heads of baseball's Cardinals and Royals, have sent out a
letter opposing a Missouri ballot initiative that would make
concealed handguns legal in the state because they fear it could be
a danger to the players, fans, and referees at games. NFLPA
president Gene Upshaw also issued a statement opposing the bill for
the same reason. Remember when all a fan wanted was an autograph? .
. . The Patriots may say that offseason workouts are unimportant,
but Bennie Thompson would argue the point. The veteran safety and
Pro Bowl special teams player was irate last week when only 34 of
his 58 Ravens teammates showed up to begin their 16-week offseason
program. He was most upset that the team's highest-paid players _
Ray Lewis, Jonathan Ogden, Tony Siragusa, and Rod Woodson _ were
absent and have made minimal appearances in the past. ``The same
people who don't attend workouts are the ones who run up to the
media during the season and complain about how we're losing and we
don't have enough commitment,'' Thompson said. ``Football is not a
six-month-a-year job. Football is year-round and it starts in the
weight room. All those guys who make millions need to stop talking
so much and show leadership. If the shoe fits, put it on.'' It
would fit more than a few men wearing Patriot uniforms the past two
seasons . . . After losing a team-record 13 games last season, the
Eagles are not only the laughingstock of Philadelphia but even
became the butt of a German airline's ad. Lufthansa's new print
campaign to promote daily nonstop service between Philly and a hub
in Frankfort that allows for travel to 100 other cities reads:
``Escape to over 100 cities where nobody makes jokes about the
Eagles.''

   Smith, the Oregon quarterback, took quick learning to new
heights when he lifted his score on the Wonderlic intelligence test
from a 16 earlier this year to a 37 at the combine last month. This
brought some skeptical looks from the league's personnel directors,
many of whom already believed Smith was the second-best quarterback
prospect regardless of his test scores. An AFC coach in the market
for a young quarterback went so far as to suggest that Smith had
been given the answers but Leigh Steinberg, who represents Smith,
insists it was merely a case of preparation. ``We had him
coached,'' Steinberg said. ``Players today have personal trainers,
nutritionists, speed coaches. Given the position, it only made
sense to prepare him for the test. In a quarterback, intelligence
is as important as 40 time. He had an SAT preparation book and I
had him coached. He met with the guy one time. I wasn't there but I
know he was coached on test-taking, not the answers. I know he
didn't take it seriously the first time. I don't see why improving
his test score should hurt him. The worst-case scenario is that
somebody prepared to take that test. What does that tell you? I
took a class before I took the LSAT. Was I coached or not? Of
course I was.'' Steinberg believes Smith, Couch, and McNabb will be
the first three players drafted. ``Being the No. 1 pick is not
something you can campaign for,'' Steinberg said. ``But I know
Akili has the best arm and throwing motion in this draft. When he
throws, he looks like a pitching machine coming over the top. He
has an arm where he can throw forever. He's the best natural talent
for the future.'' Some scouts wonder about Smith, though, fearing
he may have been a one-year wonder at Oregon. He excelled last
season after barely playing the year before following a
record-breaking career in junior college . . . An NFC personnel
head said that if Couch had come out a year ago, he would have been
rated clearly behind both Manning and Ryan Leaf. An AFC head coach
laughed at Larry Kennan's recent remark that Couch throws the deep
ball better than Drew Bledsoe. ``Sure he does,'' the coach said.
``But that's not Bledsoe's strong point. You notice he didn't say
Couch was a better passer than Bledsoe.'' The big question about
Couch is whether he has the arm to throw the 20-yard out, which
Kennan insists is no problem . . . Kennan, the Patriots'
ex-offensive coordinator and present head of the newly formed
assistant coaches union, has taken on the role of quarterback
consultant for some of the draft's best prospects. He is working
with Couch and UCLA's Cade McNown after being approached by
super-agent Tom Condon in the offseason. ``I'd had some dealings
with Tom, and when I had all that time off after I left the
Patriots, he asked if I'd like to work with his quarterbacks if he
got any,'' said Kennan. ``He wanted me to run their workouts for
the scouts and help prepare them. I gave them each a program
designed to get them ready for the scouts' workouts. They're taking
the existing system and making it work for them. If you can train
six or seven weeks for the combine and dramatically improve your
draft position, why not do it? Not everyone can make a drastic
improvement, but some can. It says something about the guy, too,
doesn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's how far the mighty have fallen. A year ago, former
Harvard Business School professor Michael McCaskey was president of
the Bears. After years of operating failures that came to a head
when he botched the negotiations to sign ex-Bears assistant Dave
McGinnis as head coach this winter, McCaskey was demoted and has
new responsibilities. He's in charge of the landscaping being done
at Halas Hall, the team's training facility in Lake Forest, Ill. .
. . If the Saints can't run the ball this year, no one will say
Ditka and club president Bill Kuharich haven't been trying. New
Orleans has three former No. 1 picks on its line, plus top-paid
free agent Wally Williams at left guard. Williams joins center
Jerry Fontenot and ex-No. 1s Chris Naeole (right guard), Willie
Roaf (left tackle), and Kyle Turley (right tackle) . . .
Realignment was again discussed during the owners' meetings, and
when the league gets to 32 teams Steelers owner Dan Rooney would
like to see eight divisions of four teams each that would play six
games within the division, eight with common opponents, and two
other games that could be used, for instance, to preserve
traditional rivalries . . . Remember quarterback Chris Miller, who
was driven out of football three years ago after repeated
concussions? He recently passed a physical for the Seahawks and is
also talking with the Bears, Lions, and Chiefs about a possible
comeback . . . After losing more than 20 starters since the dawn of
free agency, the Steelers finally fell upon hard times last year.
That has head coach Bill Cowher scrambling. Word is he's trying to
lure Will Wolford out of retirement to play left tackle on passing
downs. Pittsburgh offered free agent Wayne Gandy a four-year, $13.2
million contract but he has yet to accept . . . Word is former
Kansas City coach Marty Schottenheimer is in line to take over the
Redskins if prospective owners Ed and Howard Milstein and Daniel
Snyder ever get approval from the NFL to complete their $800
million purchase. Their effort was put on hold for another 30 days
at the owners' meeting while they try to satisfy the NFL's
questions about their financing. The situation has left present
head coach Norv Turner and GM Charley Casserly in limbo. Casserly
was in the worst of spots during the owners' meetings because he
was there under orders from the trust that controls the team to
vote for the Milstein group, even though he was likely voting for
three guys who were going to fire him . . . Adam Vinatieri should
thank his lucky stars he stayed in New England instead of trying to
kick at the new stadium in Cleveland. The wind off Lake Erie has
proven so fierce that architects added $6 million wind screens to
try to block it . . . The Browns opened their first offseason
conditioning program with 70 players on hand. The one missing
player was tight end Irv Smith, a single parent who was back in
Arizona caring for his seven-month-old child, who had a 103-degree
temperature. Here's how hard the new Browns are working to get
their players in town for the program. They not only have the usual
weights and strength coach but also provide breakfast and lunch
prepared by a team nutritionist, a karate expert for stretching
work, a speed coach, and VCRs in front of the exercise bikes so
players can view game films while sweating. ``We have to do
everything we can to keep as many players here in the offseason as
we can,'' Palmer said. ``Some players will test us on that and some
of them will be playing elsewhere.'' For those in New England
saying you can't ``force'' attendance, there's how you do it.
Unemployment insurance . . . By the way, Cleveland's program runs
15 weeks and pays only $70 per workout, with a minimum of three a
week to get paid.

   BOSTON _ On May 29, International Boxing Federation welterweight
champion Felix Trinidad will defend his title on HBO against former
IBF junior middleweight champion Vincent Pettway at Roberto
Clemente Stadium in Puerto Rico. Pettway is the IBF's No. 1-rated
welterweight, so the fight is a mandatory defense, one Trinidad
cannot avoid without losing his title and one HBO must televise or
lose its contractual hold on Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   The show must go on, all sides say, and so it will, but in truth
this is no mandatory title defense at all. It is a mandatory
mismatch, to be kind _ a mandatory execution, to be accurate. The
Vincent Pettway who will enter that ring in San Juan is no more the
No. 1 welterweight in the world than you are.
</P>
<P>
   Well shop-worn at 33, according to experts, he is not the
Pettway who was once junior middleweight champion, and how he
became the IBF's No. 1 contender for the 147-pound title is
difficult to fathom, impossible to logically explain, and
illustrative of the ills that are eating away at boxing's
credibility and moving the sport closer and closer to a federal
takeover that would be welcome by many who love it.
</P>
<P>
   This is an old story that has been repeated for decades and one
not meant to demean Pettway, who has had a long and admirable
career. It is simply a story the public needs to hear to understand
how boxing is too often run these days.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis heavyweight
unification debacle that ended with Holyfield losing to Lewis but
retaining his title when the fight was scored a draw, many things
have been written and said about boxing. There has been much
speculation about judges being paid off and fights being fixed. A
week ago in this corner, an attempt was made to show how judges and
referees are influenced not by payoffs but by the simple fact that
they work at the pleasure of boxing's three crime families _ the
IBF, World Boxing Council, and World Boxing Association _ and have
their fees and expenses taken care of by promoters. Either can
freeze an official out of work, so when they have such power, there
is no need to bribe them.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say it never happens or to argue that such
influence-peddling is not bribery by a different name. It is just
to make clear that how it's done today is difficult to prove.
</P>
<P>
   The fact of the matter is, far more college basketball games
than prizefights have been fixed in the past four decades. More
college basketball games have been fixed by Boston College players
alone, as a matter of fact, than by promoters like Don King, yet no
one doubts that Monday night's NCAA championship game will be on
the up and up regardless of what odd thing might happen. But the
same benefit of the doubt seldom goes to boxing when problems arise
and never when they arise in a fight promoted by King.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to argue that boxing has a higher moral standing
than college basketball (although if you've been watching what's
been going on at Minnesota over the last decade, maybe so). It is
just to point out that the way fights get fixed today is not to pay
someone to take a dive but simply to make matches like Trinidad vs.
Pettway, Roy Jones Jr. vs. Ricky Frazier, Oscar De La Hoya vs.
Patrick Charpentier, and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   The chief culprits in this shabby exercise of mandatory
mismatches designed to take care of favored promoters are the
people responsible for rating fighters and sanctioning title
matches. The IBF is no more guilty of this (and no less so) than
the WBC or the WBA, but it is the one that made Pettway No. 1, so
it is as good a fight as any to use as an example.
</P>
<P>
   Pettway is a 33-year-old former world champion with a 42-6-1
record. On the surface he would appear far more legitimate a
challenger than many who have preceded him, but that's part of the
trick. If an organization is smart, it doesn't put a Charpentier in
as No. 1, as the WBC did. Rather, it puts in a guy with good
pedigree who is no longer fit competition for an elite fighter.
</P>
<P>
   When HBO accepted the bout, senior vice president Lou DiBella,
who signed off on it, knew Pettway had a decent record and was a
former world champion. What he didn't know, and frankly couldn't do
anything about even if he did, was that the IBF's mandatory
challenger for one of the best punchers in the world had been
stopped by Paul Vaden on Aug. 12, 1995, 11 months after first
winning the junior middleweight title. Pettway was then stopped by
Terry Norris in a WBC-WBA title fight six months later. Since that
fight on Feb. 24, 1996, here is what Pettway has done to convince
the IBF he is the No. 1 welterweight contender in the world:
</P>
<P>
   --Moved down from 154 pounds to 147, the welterweight limit.
</P>
<P>
   --Won a 10-round decision three months after the Norris loss
from Benji Singleton, a fighter with a career record of 20-46-4 who
is 7-28-3 since he fought Pettway.
</P>
<P>
   --Stopped a fighter named Harold Bennett five months later, on
Oct. 23, 1996. Bennett's record is 18-20-2; he was knocked out in
his last four fights and seven of his last 11 dating back to the
Pettway match.
</P>
<P>
   --Did not fight for 14 months after the Bennett win, then
captured a 10-round decision from Gerald Reed, a fighter with a
15-24-3 record.
</P>
<P>
   So drained by this experience, Pettway needed another 14 months
off before he faced Reed a second time on Feb. 6 of this year,
again winning a 10-round decision from a guy who is now 4-20-3 in
his last 27 fights.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, did I mention that Pettway just happens to be promoted by
King?
</P>
<P>
   The last fact seems to be the only way Pettway became a
contender again, although Darrell Peoples, chairman of the IBF
Ratings Committee, did his best to argue otherwise Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Said Peoples, ``Pettway is a former IBF champion with a good
record.'' So is Larry Holmes, but does that make him the No. 1
heavyweight in the world?
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Pettway was due to fight Trinidad and stepped aside
or what have you (to allow the Trinidad-Pernell Whitaker fight),''
Peoples continued. ``Let me explain this to you. We can only rate
those people we receive information on and as far as it goes,
Pettway has a good record and has been staying active.''
</P>
<P>
   Staying active is one criterion by which the IBF says it rates
its fighters, but not everyone would consider a guy who's had two
fights with the same stiff in the past 28 months active. Joe Louis
hasn't been much more active the past 28 months and he's been dead
since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the IBF recently adopted a policy that said you could not
become the No. 1 contender without beating another ranked fighter.
The IBF keeps its No. 1 ranking vacant now after a fighter holding
the ranking loses a fight. When two ranked fighters meet, the
winner vaults into that slot. That is how young Fernando Vargas
became the IBF junior middleweight champion. First he beat Anthony
Stephens to become No. 1 and then destroyed Yory Boy Campas for the
title. That is how the system is supposed to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made that policy change because guys were moving up through
attrition instead of fighting,'' said Peoples. ``We wanted to
justify our No. 1 ranking by seeing the guy beat someone else in
our ratings, someone in the top 15. We adopted that in the last
year or so, so I guess Pettway got to No. 1 before we adopted the
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't think so, because 18 months ago Pettway was 10 months
into his first 14-month layoff, which not even the IBF could
construe as active. If the time frame was only a year ago, Pettway
was two months removed from his first win over the never-ranked
Reed, nearly two years removed from having faced a rated fighter,
and nearly four years removed from having beaten a rated fighter
(Simon Brown in 1995).
</P>
<P>
   So how'd he become No. 1?
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at his record and he didn't even fight a stiff in
1998,'' a well-known matchmaker said. ``There's a dozen young
welterweights you've never heard of who deserve that ahead of
Pettway but they aren't promoted by Don King.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a champion who isn't much, who's unknown himself
like half these guys, you can get away with this kind of stuff. But
when you have a high-profile champion, you can't have an unknown
No. 1 who can't fight, like Charpentier, or a shot one like
Pettway. Pettway had a legitimate career. He was a world champion
for a while, but he's a shot, shot guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But TV has to accept the fight because it's a mandatory and
then the public sees a mismatch that lasts a round or two and it
hurts boxing more.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are simply the facts of one sad case and the facts of life
for one sad sport.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to force a rapid rematch between Lewis and Holyfield
have predictably slowed; it now appears a November date is likely.
The fighters have agreed to accept $15 million each, and King is
still saying the bout can be made for September but Lewis's
promoters disagree. Panos Eliades and Dino Duva have begun to
explore sites in Great Britain, either the new Millennium Stadium
in Cardiff, Wales, that was just built to house the rugby World Cup
in October, or Ibrox Park, home of the Glasgow Rangers soccer club
in Scotland. Millennium Stadium has a roof, so it is a possibility
for an outdoor fight if the bout could be made by October. But Las
Vegas remains the leading candidate because whoever promotes the
fight will need a huge site fee to cover the purses of Holyfield
and Lewis. Who promotes it could be a sticking point as well. King
holds a contract saying he is to promote any rematch, but Duva is
claiming he had so many problems in the first fight that King will
have to accept a fee and let him do the promotion. That is
unlikely, even though other boxing chieftains believe it will be
difficult to legitimize the outcome if King is the promoter.
Lastly, HBO has yet to agree to any financial deal, although one
will come eventually because neither fighter has anybody else to
fight that the public would accept until the issue between them is
settled . . . Holyfield showed the kind of fighter he has always
been by agreeing to a $5 million pay cut within days after the
first fight. Say what you will of him, he did the same thing to get
his shot at Mike Tyson, taking $4 million less than the Duvas were
insisting on when they still represented him. That is the
difference between him and Lewis and why he fought every major
heavyweight of his time while Lewis had faced none until Holyfield.
Lewis's people were never willing to risk short-term money for
long-term gain, so he did not fight Riddick Bowe, George Foreman,
or Tyson. Holyfield fought, and beat, all of them . . . Holyfield,
by the way, told the BBC last week that he would not admit he'd
lost to Lewis. ``We both did not do enough to be called undisputed
champion,'' he said. ``It wasn't a great day for me, but I got
through it.'' . . . As much as I love Muhammad Ali, how could he
call Holyfield-Lewis ``the biggest fix in fight history''? He
fought Ken Norton three times and hasn't beaten him yet but got two
wins. And ask Jimmy Young if he truly lost his fight to Ali. The
people who write these letters and put Ali's name on them should be
a little more careful how they use the greatest fighter in history.

RUSSIA SWEEPS WORLD AWAY

 FIGURE SKATING-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELSINKI _ She was pumping her fist in triumph before the music
even stopped. Maria Butyrskaya knew the only way she wouldn't win
the world figure skating title here Saturday was if she fell splat
on her bottom _ twice.
</P>
<P>
   So when she ended her four minutes upright and unflawed inside
Hartwall Areena, Butyrskaya knew she'd made history. No Russian
woman had ever won the global crown, and no country had ever won
all four titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's going on . . . I don't even know how I
skated,'' babbled the 26-year-old Butyrskaya after she had
dethroned two-time champion Michelle Kwan, who climbed out of
fourth to salvage the silver medal ahead of Julia Soldatova, the
17-year-old Russian.
</P>
<P>
   Butyrskaya's victory capped a marvelous week for the Motherland,
which also claimed the men's (Alexei Yagudin), pairs (Elena
Berezhnaya-Anton Sikharulidze), and dance (Anjelika Krylova-Oleg
Ovsyannikov) titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done this many times in Europeans, but we didn't
believe it was possible in Worlds,'' said Elena Tchaikovskaya, who
coaches both Butyrskaya and Soldatova. ``But now, you see, we take
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The stumbling block had always been the women, who had won only
four world medals until last year. But once the Russians stopped
diverting promising girls into pairs and dance, their Moscow-based
women's team blossomed. Russia now has the deepest program on the
planet. Viktoria Volchkova finished 10th Saturday and the Russians
left two world-class women home in defending silver medalist Irina
Slutskaya and Elena Sokolova.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they weren't counting on gold here, not after
Uzbekistan's Tatiana Malinina beat Butyrskaya a fortnight ago at
the Grand Prix final in St. Petersburg. And they'd seen little of
Kwan, who skipped the Grand Prix season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We planned to take two medals, but we don't know how looks
Kwan,'' said Tchaikovskaya. ``When we come here, we see she is in
not-so-good form.''
</P>
<P>
   When the defending champ, congested and woozy, began missing
jumps in practice, the Russians began dreaming about a golden
sweep. When Kwan crashed on a double axel in Friday's short
program, they stopped worrying about her and started worrying about
Butyrskaya, who has a history of folding when the global spotlight
comes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``How this fantastic woman, this fantastic skater could not do
in performance _ it is nonsense,'' said Tchaikovskaya. So
Tchaikovskaya went to work on her pupil's fragile psyche and a
bolder, more confident Butyrskaya emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day by day, was work,'' Tchaikovskaya said. ``But she now
believes she can do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Butyrskaya's recent bare-bottomed pose in the Russian
edition of Playboy was her symbolic breakthrough, but she was a
different skater once she survived a shaky qualifying round here.
And so was Kwan, who admitted that she let her illness get into her
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cold probably hit harder mentally than physically,'' she
said. ``My confidence level was a little down.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwan came here hoping to be the first woman since Katarina Witt
to win three titles in four years. But once she went splat in the
short program, Kwan was hoping just to stay on the awards podium.
And Butyrskaya knew she had a priceless cushion.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan couldn't win unless the Russian finished third in the long
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous,'' Butyrskaya conceded, ``but I knew I could be
second and still win.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Butyrskaya skated cleanly with only sixth-place Anna
Rechnio of Poland remaining, she knew she had the title. But Kwan,
waiting backstage, didn't know she was finished.

   ``I was in the dressing room with the door shut,'' she said. ``I
heard a lot of screaming, but I didn't hear the marks.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter, Kwan decided when she took the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about winning or losing,'' she told herself. ``It's
about skating.''
</P>
<P>
   Her skating was far from perfect _ Kwan did a sloppy triple lutz
combination and singled her double axel _ but her artistry was
enough to lift her into second place and a fourth consecutive world
medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a rough week for me, a lot of ups and downs,'' Kwan
said. ``But I'm really proud of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Her silver plus a remarkable seventh-place finish by 13-year-old
Sarah Hughes were enough to assuage the Americans' worst fears _
that they would lose a spot for next year's event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a blast out there, a party on the ice,'' exulted Hughes,
the youngest skater in the field.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the Russians who were popping the champagne at day's
end, toasting the woman who enabled them to run the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we won't give the title away any more,'' Butyrskaya
mused.

<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Here's a baker's dozen of rookies who are
expected to make an impact around the major leagues this season:
</P>
<P>
   1. J.D. Drew, Cardinals. They may boo him in Philadelphia,
because he spurned the Phillies, but he ranks second only to Mark
McGwire as the Redbirds' attraction. There's no ceiling for this
guy.
</P>
<P>
   2. Bruce Chen, Braves. Lefthander had a slow start in camp, but
Atlanta was so confident he was ready to join baseball's best
rotation that it traded Denny Neagle to the Reds. Drafted at 16 out
of Panama, Chen draws high marks for his intelligence and maturity.
</P>
<P>
   3. Mitch Meluskey, Astros. Switch-hitting catcher prompted
Houston to deal Brad Ausmus to the Tigers. Meluskey, 25, hit .353
for Triple A New Orleans, with power (17 home runs).
</P>
<P>
   4. Eric Chavez, A's. Third baseman was Baseball America's Minor
League Player of the Year after hitting a combined .327 with 33
home runs and 126 RBIs. The lefthanded hitter is a leading
candidate to succeed teammate Ben Grieve as AL Rookie of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   5. Carlos Guillen, Mariners. One of three players acquired by
Seattle in the Randy Johnson deal, this second baseman has batted
close to .400 this spring and will be Seattle's leadoff hitter.
</P>
<P>
   6. Gabe Kapler, Tigers. The team's minor league player of the
year at Double A Jacksonville has been so impressive this spring
that there has been speculation that the Tigers would trade Bobby
Higginson. Club says no, but Kapler could force his way into the
outfield.
</P>
<P>
   7. Carlos Beltran, Royals. Switch-hitting native of Puerto Rico
started last season in Single A ball; at 21, he figures to be
Kansas City's starting center fielder on Opening Day. Beltran has
outstanding speed and sound defensive instincts.
</P>
<P>
   8. Trot Nixon, Red Sox. He's had an up-and-down spring
offensively, but if he isn't too hard on himself, he should do fine
in right-field platoon.
</P>
<P>
   9. Christian Guzman, Twins. Another Dominican shortstop, this
20-year-old was at Double A New Britain last season but his play
this spring is forcing manager Tom Kelly to consider rushing him to
the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   10. Marlon Anderson, Phillies. Second baseman's speed and
extra-base power (32 doubles, 14 triples, 16 home runs for
Scranton/Wilkes-Barre) have this 25-year-old cracking the Phillies'
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   11. Warren Morris, Pirates. Pittsburgh cleared second baseman
Tony Womack from the roster for Morris, who was supposed to be a
year away but may turn Elvis (Mike Benjamin) back into a
utilityman.
</P>
<P>
   12. Braden Looper, Marlins. He's hit 100 miles an hour on the
radar gun, which is why Florida insisted he be part of the Edgar
Renteria deal with the Cardinals. Righthander will be used in setup
role this season, but has closer stuff.
</P>
<P>
   13. Roy Halladay, Blue Jays. Righthander threw a one-hitter
after September callup. At 6 feet 6 inches and 205 pounds, the
21-year-old probably will begin the season in the bullpen, but may
crack the rotation by midseason.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of New England's richest gifts to the game, George
``Birdie'' Tebbetts, a former catcher, manager, GM, and scout, died
at age 86 last week.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Burlington, Vt., raised in Nashua, N.H., and a graduate
of Providence College (with a degree in philosophy), Tebbetts
played 14 seasons, four with the Red Sox (1947-50), and also
managed the Reds, Braves, and Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Duquette's assistant, Eddie Haas, fractured his leg while
playing for the Braves in the late '50s, when Tebbetts was general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made sure someone came to see me every day when I was in
the hospital,'' Haas said. ``Either he came himself, or his wife
came, or he sent someone from the club. He treated me great. He was
a great man.''
</P>
<P>
   Tebbetts's last job in baseball was as a ``master'' scout for
the expansion Florida Marlins, whose scouting director, Gary
Hughes, hired some of the game's most legendary talent hunters to
track minor league players prior to the expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   Tebbetts told a story of coming home to New Hampshire to play
for a semipro team in a Sunday ballgame _ the kind of mill-town
game that Connie Mack, the owner of the Philadelphia Athletics,
would let his players take part in to pocket some extra cash.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, Lefty Grove, the Hall of Fame pitcher, was promised
$10 for every batter he struck out. College player George Tebbetts
was to be his catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first nine pitches he threw during warmups, I caught about
three,'' Tebbetts said. ``The others hit my glove and bounced 6
feet away.
</P>
<P>
   ``He scared me. There was no backstop, and the grandstand was
very close. A lady said to me, `Son, you better get the ballplayer
who's going to catch the game.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That made me so damn mad. Even if he threw bullets, I was
going to catch them.''
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon, Grove struck out 19 and told Tebbetts _ who'd
slightly adjusted the way he held his glove to catch Grove's rising
fastball _ that he would recommend him to Mack. But Tebbetts
already had committed to the Detroit Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years later I get up in Fenway Park and Grove was
pitching,'' Tebbetts said. ``I got a hit, and he looks over to
first base and says, `I guess I'm a pretty good scout.' I just hung
my head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next time up, he knocked me on my butt.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Haas, incidentally, once pinch-hit for Henry Aaron and claims he
was the last man to manage Joe DiMaggio in a game. There is a
catch, of course. Haas said he was managing in the last old-timers
game in which DiMaggio played. As for hitting for Aaron, that
happened in an exhibition game, when Fred Haney was managing the
Braves and noticed that Steve Dalkowski, the lefthander noted for a
high-velocity fastball and a total inability to control it, had
taken the mound. Said Haas, ``Haney saw Dalkowski throw a couple to
the screen while warming up, turned to the bench and said, `Aaron,
sit down. Haas, you're hitting.' '' . . . Wind beneath their wings:
Last season the Cubs went 51-31 at Wrigley Field, the first time
since 1984, when they won the NL East, that they won 50 or more
games in the Friendly Confines. The Cubs PR staff broke down the
team's record with regard to the wind conditions, and the results
may surprise you. First of all, the wind was blowing in more than
twice the number of games it was blowing out (54-22), contrary to
Wrigley's reputation as a hitter's paradise. The Cubs' record was
31-23 when the wind was blowing in, 15-7 when it was blowing out.
On the six days when there was a crosswind, the Cubs were 5-1. The
number of runs per game nearly doubled (14.5 to 8.3) on the days
the Bleacher Bums had the wind in their faces . . . The chances of
Todd Hundley being ready to catch for the Dodgers by Opening Day
are increasingly remote. As recently as Tuesday, Hundley caught a
bullpen session for Darren Dreifort and threw the ball back to the
pitcher only half the time. On every other pitch, Hundley flipped
the ball to physical therapist Pat Screnar, who threw the ball back
to Dreifort. ``I'm sure there are some Dodgers fans back in LA who
are pushing the panic button right now,'' Hundley said. ``But
everything is going to work out fine.'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson and GM Kevin Malone are making contingency plans to carry
three catchers at the start of the season: Hundley, plus rookies
Angel Pena and Paul LoDuca. There's also a chance Hundley will
begin the season on the DL. ``If we have to do that, we have to do
that,'' Hundley said. ``That's better than rushing it and playing
two days, then having to take two months off. After any surgery,
you're never going to be the same. You have to do your best to
manage it. That's what we're doing.'' . . . More LA blues: Dodgers
outfielder Gary Sheffield, who recently made noise about wanting to
retire, even though he still has five years left on his six-year,
$61 million contract, was named in a paternity suit in Broward
County, Fla. If the allegations are true, Garrett Wan-Dre Sheffield
would be the player's fourth child with four different women, none
of whom he has married . . . With catcher Carlos Hernandez lost for
the season because of a ruptured Achilles' tendon, the only
positional starters back for the Padres team that won the NL
pennant last season are right fielder Tony Gwynn, shortstop Chris
Gomez, first baseman Wally Joyner, and second baseman Quilvio
Veras. With Kevin Brown a Dodger and Joey Hamilton traded to the
Blue Jays, the pitching rotation returns only Andy Ashby and
Sterling Hitchcock. Woody Williams came from the Blue Jays in the
Hamilton deal, while Matt Clement and Stan Spencer spent most of
last season in the minors.

   Ever wonder, while watching a Sox game from Fort Myers, how you
could make your lawn look as impossibly green as the perfectly
manicured field at City of Palms Park? ``Good luck and a big
pocketbook,'' says Jimmy Collins, the head groundskeeper for the
last seven years at the ballpark. ``It just takes good, proper,
solid maintenance.'' The infield grass at City of Palms is GN-1
(Greg Norman-1), the outfield Certified 419 Bermuda. The infield
dirt, a mixture of sand and clay, is straight from central Florida.
Collins uses liquid nitrogen as his fertilizer, once a week. ``No
matter how often you fertilize, even if it's once every two months,
you have to do it on a consistent basis,'' he said. ``Your lawn
gets used to being fed, and the more you feed it, the better it
looks.'' Collins, 31, grew up in Lakeland, Fla., across the street
from Joker Marchant Stadium, spring home of the Tigers. ``As a kid,
I used to go over and beg to take down the flag,'' Collins said.
``They used to let us ride the mower. We used to shag foul balls,
too, for a dollar a ball or a bag of french fries. I never dreamed
I'd become a groundskeeper.'' . . . Duquette says he has little
interest in Hideo Nomo, released last week by the Mets. Nomo's
velocity isn't what it was when he starred for the Dodgers, and
hitters are laying off his split-fingered fastball, which breaks
out of the strike zone. Duquette's interest in Kevin Appier seems
to be waning, even though the Royals' ace had his best outing of
the spring Friday, when his velocity was consistently in the 88-90
m.p.h. range. It could be a negotiating ploy on Duquette's part. He
thinks the Royals want too much in return. Royals GM Herk Robinson
is seeking at least two quality prospects for Appier, who at the
moment is slated to pitch against the Red Sox in the season opener
April 5 . . . Steve Fisher, hired Friday to coach the San Diego
State basketball team, may just be keeping the seat warm for Gwynn.
The Aztecs' most famous alum said he'd like to return to his alma
mater as coach of either the basketball or baseball team. ``If one
of those two jobs is open when I'm finished playing, I wouldn't
hesitate going for it,'' Gwynn said. ``I'd get on the horn and call
in all my markers. And I've got plenty of markers.'' Gwynn came to
San Diego State from Long Beach on a basketball scholarship in 1977
and was a point guard on two of San Diego State's top-scoring
teams. In 1981, he was drafted by both the Padres (third round) and
the then-San Diego Clippers (10th round) of the NBA . . . So, how
does Cardinals manager Tony La Russa plan to handle the PR
catastrophe any time McGwire takes a day off? He says he intends to
use Shawon Dunston and Willie McGee, a beloved figure in St. Louis,
at first base. ``I can't wait to do this (McGee at first),'' said
La Russa. ``I want to do it on a weekend in St. Louis when there
are 45,000 people there and somebody else hits third. Say, Ray
Lankford hits third and people say, `Uh-oh, Mark is not playing.'
Eric Davis is hitting fourth, and hitting fifth and playing first,
Willie McGee. There's no doubt in my mind that they wouldn't boo
Willie McGee.''

   As improbable as it seems, Holyoke's Mark Wohlers, who last
summer lost the ability to throw the ball over the plate, is a
serious contender to reclaim his closer role. Kerry Ligtenberg, who
ended last season as the closer, needs elbow surgery, and a couple
of fine outings this spring by Wohlers put him very much back in
the picture. But lefthander John Rocker remains Bobby Cox's primary
option . . . Gary DiSarcina's broken arm has not healed as quickly
as he would have liked. The Angels shortstop will remain in a cast
for another week at least. He was put on the 15-day disabled list
and is probably out until mid-April at least. Jeff Huson and Andy
Stankiewicz are the leading candidates for the shortstop job, but
the Angels are also talking to San Diego about a possible deal in
which Phil Nevin would go to the Padres for Ed Giavanola or Andy
Sheets . . . Mo Vaughn may prove to be Angels savior, but he can't
put an end to their bizarre history of injuries. Besides DiSarcina,
pitcher Jason Dickson has a torn labrum in his right shoulder and
is out for the season, joining second baseman Justin Baughman
(broken leg that will require a second operation) and relievers Pep
Harris and Mike James (both reconstructive elbow surgery). ``You
don't ever get used to losing key players, and I'm getting pretty
sick of this,'' manager Terry Collins said. ``You arrive in the
morning and find one guy is out for a month and another guy is out
for three or four months at least. You just want to stop playing
and wait until April, but we'll play through it. We'll find a way
to get through it, as usual.'' . . . It took only one spring
training for the Mariners' trade of Johnson to tilt a little more
favorably toward Seattle. All three players the Mariners acquired
from Houston are likely to make the team. Guillen is having a
terrific spring, hitting close to .400, and will be the team's
second baseman and leadoff hitter. Rookie Freddy Garcia figures to
be the No. 3 starter, and John Halama may be the only lefty in the
bullpen. ``We thought when we made that trade last summer that we
were being unduly criticized,'' manager Lou Piniella said. ``There
were unknown names, so I understand. Wait until people see what
they can do.'' The Astros, meanwhile, were left empty-handed when
Johnson signed as a free agent with the Diamondbacks . . . The
Phillies haven't moved off their refusal to trade ace Curt
Schilling, whom the Cleveland Indians make no secret of coveting.
There's a mutual admiration there. ``That club,'' Schilling said,
``is the surest lock of any team in baseball to be playing in
October. More so even than the Yankees because of the division
they're in.'' Schilling got the hard sell on the Indians during
last fall's tour of Japan with other major leaguers. Manny Ramirez
and Mike Jackson of the Indians were members of that team, which
was managed by Mike Hargrove. ``Players talk,'' Schilling said. ``I
stood in the outfield a lot with Mike Jackson and talked about
their club. They have careers as salesmen after they get out of
baseball.''

ORIOLES GAME A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ Julio Puig Gay waits for just the right moment.
</P>
<P>
   Arms folded tightly, he leans on his back foot while his eyes
carefully survey the scene.
</P>
<P>
   He says nothing until . . . he . . . hears . . . those . . .
words. Now!
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, Cuban baseball players are the best!'' Puig, 35,
yells with the full force of his lungs as he thrusts his arms in
front of him. ``But things have changed. We don't even use the same
bats anymore, so we don't know how we'll do against the
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   There. Puig executes a perfectly timed shout, as precise as a
sacrifice bunt, and sparks another round of ear-piercing debates at
La Esquina Caliente, a section of Havana's Central Park known as
the Hot Corner, where dozens of men and a few women spend
sweltering afternoons arguing about sports.
</P>
<P>
   The heat at the corner has been blistering lately, mostly over
baseball, which has been Cuba's passion since American troops and
mill workers brought the game to this island more than a century
ago.
</P>
<P>
   These days the cacophony of voices can be heard debating the
merits of wooden bats versus aluminum; of the Havana Industrials
versus their cross-island rivals from Santiago de Cuba in this
week's national playoffs, and of Sunday's exhibition game between a
Cuban all-star team and the Baltimore Orioles, the first time in 40
years a major league team has played here.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say this is an exhibition game, but it's really a test
for Cuba's baseball,'' said Giselle Olivas, 45, who stopped by the
corner for a few rounds of arguments on her way home. ``We don't
want to see players practice, we want them to play as hard as they
can.''
</P>
<P>
   The fanatics at La Esquina and the hundreds of other informal
sports clubs throughout the country insist that Sunday's game is
about pelota _ baseball _ and not government policies. But they are
acutely aware of the politics surrounding the event.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the 37-year-old US economic embargo on Cuba, which
dates back to the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, US companies,
including major league teams, have been prohibited from recruiting
and doing business here. Although Canada has no such ban, major
league rules extend to the Montreal Expos and the Toronto Blue
Jays.
</P>
<P>
   But decades of isolation and economic hardship have not
diminished Cuba's appetite for baseball.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, about 40,000 screaming fans packed the Estadio
Latinoamericano in the capital to catch the opening game of the
national playoffs between Havana and Santiago de Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   There was no organ or flashing signs telling them when to cheer,
but the spectators, who paid 10 or 20 cents a ticket, created their
own soundtrack. They banged on drums or cowbells. They honked
horns, whistled, and chanted. Young and old alike constantly yelled
at players about how to hit, throw, and run.
</P>
<P>
   Play was delayed briefly before the bottom of the second inning
by an announcement about baseball's ``importance to the
revolution,'' and to remind fans about proper behavior and that
alcohol was not permitted in the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba produces some of the most skilled players and its teams
have regularly dominated world amateur competitions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many Cubans have defected to the United States in
recent years and have reached the grandes ligas, most notably Tampa
Bay pitcher Rolando Arrojo, Florida Marlins pitcher Livan
Hernandez, the 1997 World Series MVP, and his half-brother Orlando
``El Duque'' Hernandez, who pitches for the World Series champion
New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Although state-controlled media seldom print stories about major
league teams, mostly to censor information about Cuban players who
have defected, the most ardent fans keep up by reading box scores
from other newspapers that are smuggled into the country.
</P>
<P>
   One 27-year-old man, who asked not to be identified, said he
managed to peek at ESPN at the hotel where he works.
</P>
<P>
   Orioles owner Peter Angelos began negotiating a Cuba series for
his team three years ago, and it appeared it would never happen
until President Clinton relaxed some of the embargo's rules in
January.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal nearly fell apart again amid disputes over how the
proceeds would be distributed. Eventually, both the US and Cuban
governments decided to use the funds to benefit baseball and sports
programs in each country.
</P>
<P>
   The teams will conclude their series in Baltimore next month.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, though, has stirred controversy, particularly among
Cuban-Americans and others in the United States who oppose Fidel
Castro's Communist government. In an interview last week with the
Fort Lauderdale Sun Sentinel, Marlins owner John Henry questioned
whether the Orioles were using the Cuba trip to quietly scout Cuban
players, a charge Oriole officials deny.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are already signs that other teams want to follow the
Orioles' lead. The Anaheim Angels reportedly applied to the US
Treasury Department last month for permission to negotiate with the
Cuban government for a game next year.
</P>
<P>
   When they take the field Sunday afternoon at the Estadio
Latinoamericano, Cuba's 50,000-seat stadium that stands out like a
precious jewel in a city filled with faded and dilapidated
buildings, the Orioles will be the first US professional team to
play here since the Cincinnati Reds and Los Angeles Dodgers played
two spring training games in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, in what many consider to have been the last
match between a Cuban team and a professional US squad, the Havana
Sugar Kings beat the Triple A Minneapolis Millers in the seventh
game of the Junior World Series. The Millers' second baseman was
future Red Sox great Carl Yastrzemski.
</P>
<P>
   Some Cubans are also fretting about the Baltimore series, but
not for political reasons. Their concern is timing.
</P>
<P>
   Because Sunday's game is taking place during the middle of the
national playoffs, some of the country's best and most experienced
players _ such as Antonio Pacheco, German Mesa, and Oreste Kindelan
_ won't be in Cuba's all-star lineup.
</P>
<P>
   And it's only been a few weeks since Cuban teams have stopped
using aluminum bats _ to comply with changes in international rules
and to prepare for the Orioles. Fans argue the players have not had
enough time to make the adjustment to wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this moment, I don't think it's the best time to play each
other,'' said Jorge Marroga, a 37-year-old Havana resident who sat
sipping homemade rum with a half-dozen other men in another
informal sports club in the Barrio Chino neighborhood. ``We like to
play against anyone, but I don't think we have a major league-type
team right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Still others back at La Esquina grumble that they won't be able
to see the game Sunday. Most of the tickets have been given out to
the media _ including more than 300 from the United States _ and to
special guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the ones here who deserve to go because we know about
baseball,'' said Eddie Jimenez. ``I guess this is capitalism. But
that's OK, because we all still have baseball in our blood.''

VERDICT TO KRAJICEK AS MEN HAVE THEIR DAY 
</HEADLINE>
 CHAMPIONSHIPS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. _ They were the warmup act for the Sisters
Sledgehammer, a couple of European guys determinedly entertaining a
sunburnt full-house gathering of 14,000 at Crandon Park with their
zinging strings.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither had been expected to play the title-round gig
when the Lipton began its 11-day run, world No. 7 Richard Krajicek,
the new champ _ 4-6, 6-2, 6-1, 7-5 _ and No. 74 Sebastien Grosjean,
perhaps a new factor in tennis, made the best of their 2 1/2 hours
on the asphalt stage.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Saturday they were strictly second racket to Venus
and Serena, the hammering sisters who occupy the historic main
event Sunday afternoon. That's all anybody's talking about. It's
Williams Time now on this isle across the bay from Miami as the
sinewy teen-agers, Venus the elder at 18, swing at each other for
the family title as well as the Lipton.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly sisters have clashed for titles here and there
before, but never in this century for such a prominent prize: The
Lipton is among the planet's leading 10 tennis events. You'd have
to go back to the baptismal Wimbledon of 1884 to find female
siblings _ Maud and Lillian Watson _ battling for a major. Maud,
19, won.
</P>
<P>
   To leap into the final, No. 16 Serena and No. 6 Venus on Friday
had to take care of foes familiar with No. 1. Serena, defying
deficits of 0-4 and 2-5 in the first and second sets, bumped
current leading lady Martina Hingis, 6-4, 7-6 (7-3). Venus then
blotted Hingis's predecessor, Steffi Graf, 6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be Venus if she puts her mind to it,'' says papa Richard
Williams. ``But Serena is playing the best tennis on the circuit
right now'' _ riding a 16-match streak.
</P>
<P>
   Krajicek, the Frying Dutchman with the boiling serve (24 aces),
was nearly fried himself in the 89-degree heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was struggling,'' he said. ``I haven't been eating well,
been feeling weakened. I thought I had sunstroke in the semis
against (Thomas) Enqvist. I'm happy I didn't have to go to a fifth.
As it was I played economic, short points, conserved my strength.''
</P>
<P>
   But his serve, plus deft volleying, carried him in the crunches
against the bouncy 20-year-old Frenchman, who seemed Tom Thumb in
the company of the 6-foot-5-inch Krajicek. Eight inches shorter,
Grosjean countered Krajicek's power with speed afoot and low,
dipping backhand returns that won him the opening set _ and almost
projected him into a fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Grosjean held a set point (4-5, 30-40) to get himself even for a
stretch run, and had a look at a second serve. Not a good look.
Instead of high velocity, Krajicek went for high bounce at low
speed. ``An aggressive kicker,'' he called it, spinning
malevolently, bounding far above Grosjean's backhand, and setting
up the victor for a volley and smash. That was the critical point.
</P>
<P>
   Grosjean, whose name translates as ``big John,'' was for a time
considered too small to receive financial support from the French
Federation. But he grew in prowess to become the world's top junior
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite player was Stefan Edberg, but I play more like
Michael Chang,'' laughed he who pushed Carlos Moya off the No. 1
perch in the fourth round, and beat ex-French Open champ Gustavo
Kuerten in the second.
</P>
<P>
   As the third unseeded finalist in the Lipton's 15 years, he was
unable to equal the winning feat of similarly disregarded champ Tim
Mayotte of Springfield, Mass., in 1985. But Grosjean boosted his
ranking to No. 45 _ ``very happy, my first time in the top 50'' _
and says he'll probably play in August at Boston, where he beat
Jonas Bjorkman, then a top-10 guy, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Krajicek, conqueror of Pete Sampras in the quarters, advances to
a career high of No. 4. His meeting with Grosjean evoked the old
crapshooting cry of ``Baby needs a new pair of shoes!'' Both he and
Grosjean became fathers recently, and shoes should be no problem.
Even as the warmup act, they did OK: $360,000 for Krajicek,
$190,000 for his victim.

O'MEARA'S ACT TOUGH TO FOLLOW 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ After joining the PGA Tour in 1981 out
of Long Beach State, Mark O'Meara built a reputation as a steady
player. After all, a record five victories in the Pebble Beach
National Pro-Am said he could play.
</P>
<P>
   But his story took a sudden turn last year. O'Meara won the
Masters with a birdie-par-birdie-birdie finish; only Arnold Palmer
had ever birdied the last two holes to win at Augusta. Then O'Meara
went to the British Open at Royal Birkdale and beat Brian Watts in
the four-hole playoff for those tied after 72 holes. At age 41, he
became the oldest man to win two major championships in one year.
He was named the PGA Tour's Player of the Year, beating out young
turks David Duval and Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is pretty darn good,'' said O'Meara, who started off
72-73 at The Players Championship. ``It was a very special year for
me, just to break through. Last year was tremendous. I'm trying to
do the best I can this year, and I have gotten off to a reasonable
start.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara, who became a father figure to Orlando neighbor Woods
before stealing a little bit of the spotlight from him last year,
was asked how he could top Player of the Year honors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't,'' he said. ``I'm not going to lie to you. Last year
was a special year, and if things don't go as well this year, so
what?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've had a pretty solid career, a consistently good
career. I want to play well, because I play for my pride. I should
also enjoy the moment, too. I needed to enjoy what happened to me
last year and what has happened to me throughout my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed the cut last week (at Bay Hill) and I was
disappointed. I'm not going to eat myself up over it. I am 42.
There's no need to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will try to play well, for me and for my family and friends.
But whether I can move on to the next level and play well at the US
Open and the PGA Championship would complete an unbelievable run. I
feel I've been improving. I didn't necessarily strike it last year
as good as I have in other years, but I did the right things at the
right time and hit the right shots and made the right putts under
crucial moments.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods has been an inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing him win the Masters in the fashion he did and knowing
when I am playing with him that it is kind of challenging, I think
that challenge has been something that helped push me and elevate
me a little bit,'' said O'Meara.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm playing with Tiger, he's bombing it by me and I've
got to figure some way to bring my game up a couple of notches.
It's had a pretty big impact.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing O'Meara doesn't crave is the attention Woods draws,
especially from the young. Woods also has been criticized for an
occasional tantrum on the course, something Arnold Palmer brought
up at Bay Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Tiger understands he has made a few mistakes,'' said
O'Meara. ``I think he knows when he slams his driver in the ground
on national TV he has made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine all of you have made mistakes at 22 or 23. If he
walked off the tee with a smile on his face, you'd better start
worrying a little bit. He has a little bit of a temper, but he
wouldn't be the player he is today if he didn't. I saw Davis Love
hit a sprinkler head on the 17th (at Bay Hill), and I don't see
guys ripping him. It's unfortunate Tiger is in the position he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's under the microscope, but I think he's handled it pretty
well considering he's 23. Hopefully he'll learn from his mistakes.
There is a lot of pressure applied on him constantly, day in and
day out, on the course and off the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to a movie with my wife and Tiger the other night. The
three of us went into a McDonald's and some girl behind the counter
spotted him. She let out the biggest yell you have ever heard. It
scared the living daylights out of me. She just freaked out. Since
she's screaming, the whole mall knows that Tiger's there. That is
the price that Tiger has to pay for the fame that he has.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Caddie Mike ``Fluff'' Cowan, who recently parted ways with
Woods, said reports of a loud exchange between the two in a parking
lot at Riviera after the Nissan Open were greatly exaggerated.
``There were no loud words,'' said Cowan, who tried unsuccessfully
to get work at TPC. ``The media blew it all out of proportion.''
Cowan said he might take the summer off to play golf. He's thinking
of a return to the links courses of Ireland, where he went last
year and encouraged Woods to go on the way to the British Open . .
. Cowan was in attendance Wednesday night when the Professional
Caddies Association Worldwide held its first Caddie Hall of Fame
induction at the World Golf Village on the outskirts of St.
Augustine. The ceremony was held at the new statue of Francis
Ouimet, who was inducted along with Angelo Argea, Squeeky Medlen,
and Peter Coleman. Argea caddied for Jack Nicklaus. Medlen, who
died two years ago after a long bout with cancer, worked for Nick
Price. Coleman worked for Nancy Lopez and Seve Ballesteros. Ouimet
caddied at The Country Club before winning the 1913 US Open there;
the scholarship fund in his memory celebrated its 50th anniversaty
at a gathering in Boston's Back Bay a couple of weeks ago . . .
Willie Peterson, who carried the bag for Nicklaus in five of his
six Masters championships in the era when players were required to
employ a club caddie from Augusta, died a week ago in New York.
Nicklaus continued to look after him, on occasion putting up bail
money when Peterson was jailed in Augusta for infractions usually
associated with the consumption of alcohol. When Peterson gave up
drinking and became somewhat destitute, Nicklaus named him caddie
master at the exclusive Loxahatchee Club he built in Jupiter, Fla.
When a visitor would ask about his involvement with Nicklaus at the
Masters, Peterson would say, ``We have five green jackets.'' . . .
Jerry McGee, a Senior Tour player who won four times on the PGA
Tour, underwent cancer surgery on his neck and tongue Thursday. He
is expected to undergo 5-6 weeks of chemotherapy and will be out of
action for a minimum of three months . . . Duval was asked about
recent gallery problems, with fans becoming more vocal and using
cellular phones and cameras. ``You might hear a cell phone now and
again,'' he said. ``I haven't found a problem with it. I contend if
your head is where it should be, you are not going to hear the
cameras. The phones might be a little bit of a bigger problem. It
always seems they go off during someone's backswing. What are we
going to do? There are some people who feel they have to be in
touch. Doctors have to be reachable. I don't blame them.'' Duval
said he has been heckled only once. ``I had an instance in match
play when someone was loudly cheering for my ball to miss the hole
and go off the green,'' he said, ``but I haven't personally found
that to be a problem.'' At last year's US Open at San Francisco's
Olympic Club, Duval's playing partner, Colin Montgomerie, was
heckled. ``I thought it was out of line,'' said Duval. ``There was
nothing I could do about it. It was rude, but you need to move
beyond it and not let it bother you. You have still got to play.
It's still the US Open.'' . . . Golfweek recently released its list
of America's best classical courses and best modern courses
(constructed after 1960). The classical list includes The Country
Club at No. 20, No. 43 Taconic GC in Williamstown, Mass., No. 46
Salem CC, No. 44 The Kittansett Club, No. 53 Myopia Hunt Club, No.
62 Sankaty Head GC, No. 71 Newport CC, No. 76 Yale GC, No. 85
Oyster Harbors, No. 94 Country Club of Fairfield (Conn.), No. 95
Winchester CC, and No. 100 Essex County Club. The list of the best
modern courses includes No. 96 Crumpin-Fox Club in Bernardston,
Mass. . . . Amy Alcott, who won five major championships on the
LPGA Tour and has 29 victories overall, was inducted into the World
Golf Hall of Fame after standards were relaxed for LPGA players.
``Little did I know 35 years ago when I started with a sawed-off
club that this day would ever come,'' said Alcott. ``Today without
question is a dream come true for me.''

REICHEL MILE STONE GOAL LIFTS COYOTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - If a man reaches a milestone, he wants it to mean
something.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes' Robert Reichel will not forget the 500th point of
his NHL career. His breakaway goal at 15:30 of the third period
proved to be the game winner as the Coyotes defeated the Calgary
Flames, 2-1, on Saturday night at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Reichel has scored six points in the four games _ and fourth
goal in four games _ he has played for Phoenix since being acquired
last Saturday from the New York Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about 500,'' said Reichel. ``It's a nice mark
but it's more important to win this game. Calgary played very, very
hard. This game is almost like a playoff game, so it's very
important that we learn to win these types of games.''
</P>
<P>
   He took a quick outlet pass from Oleg Tverdovsky just before
crossing the red line and skated in free and clear to beat goalie
Ken Wregget and break up a stingy, tightly played game that didn't
figure to a high-scoring affair, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a look and saw him hanging back there and I hit him,''
said Tverdosky. ``The points haven't been coming to me too often
this season, so I'll take any kind I can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes goalie Nikolai Khabibulin entered with a 10-1-3 career
record against the Flames and his opposite number, Wregget, was
merely on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Wregget was unbeaten in his past four games and had allowed just
four goals in his past three. He hadn't allowed more than two goals
in his last six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a young team and they play with a lot of
enthusiasm,'' Coyotes wing Jeremy Roenick said. ``They play that
1-2-2 trap and it's almost impossible to play against. You have to
flip the puck in over them, or bounce if off the boards, and if you
happen to catch their defensemen playing shallow, beat them to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The system has enabled the Flames to post the NHL's second-best
record since the All-Star break. Saturday's loss was only their
sixth in their past 26 games.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick had a rather eventful second period.
</P>
<P>
   He ended a six-game goal scoring slump by finally cracking
Wregget at 3:05 of the second period to put Phoenix up 1-0, then
promptly played a role in allowing the Flames to knot the score on
Cory Stillman's power play goal at 16:05 of the period.
</P>
<P>
   After getting into a brief scuffle along the boards with Ed
Ward, the two went up ice in pursuit of the puck and left their
business undone, until Ward cracked the Coyotes' Keith Tkachuk at
mid ice.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick went after Ward only to be intercepted by Calgary winger
Dave Roch e, who was pounced upon by Phoenix winger Stephen Leach.
When the ice chips had finally settled, Roenick drew two minutes
for interference and Roche and Leach each drew two for roughing,
leaving the Coyotes a man short.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick's goal came when he found himself all alone on Wregget
and deked right and and left, pulling Wregget out of position,
before sliding the puck past the goalie's stick side.
</P>
<P>
   The play was actually set up when Tkachuk broke in on Wregget
but lost control of the puck. He then followed it around the net
and passed to Tverdovsky, who threaded a pass that Roenick took off
Leach's stick and straight to Wregget.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really a good pass and I squeezed through an opening
and happened to find myself wide open,'' Roenick said.
</P>
<P>
   Stillman knotted the score 29 seconds later, knocking home a
quick shot from the side of the net. Calgary's Rene Corbet knocked
Phoenix defenseman Teppo Numminen off the puck right in front of
the Khabibulin and got it Jerome Iginla, who found the wide open
Stillman.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the first two meetings this season when the Coyotes
scored a combined five goals in the first period en route to a win
and a tie, Calgary pretty much controlled a scoreless, penalty
free-first period.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, sounds simplistic, unless you happen to be
Khabibulin or Wregget.
</P>
<P>
   Khabibulin had to turn away 12 shots, including stopping Valeri
Bure ``mano a mano'' at the 6:02 mark, while Wregget only had to
face nine shots. But two of those shots came at point blank range
from Greg Adams and Shane Doan, just after Rick Tocchet never
pulled the trigger on a 2-on-1 rush with Reichel and was forced to
bring the puck back from behind the net. &QL;

STARS FEELING STING OF CHAOTIC STRETCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The Stars are either a tired, banged-up team
in dire need of rest, or they have picked a horrible time to lose
focus.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into today's 5:30 p.m. game with Nashville, Stars coach
Ken Hitchcock isn't about to accept either explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a hard March. But we've never been an organization
to make excuses, and we're not about to start now,'' Hitchcock
said. ``We just have to fight through this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars closed the locker-room doors for 25 minutes after a
5-1 loss to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim on Friday night. Both
Hitchcock and the players laid out a litany of problems that have
been creeping into the team's performance, including a lack of
aggressive forechecking, poor defensive zone coverage, poor puck
movement, lack of drive to the net in the offensive zone and
overall sloppiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time we should be getting our game back to our
level, not the opposite,'' defenseman and alternate captain Craig
Ludwig said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had plenty of reasons for their poor outing. They were
playing their second consecutive game, their third road game in
four nights and their 10th game in the past 17 nights. The Ducks,
meanwhile, hadn't played since Sunday and haven't left the Los
Angeles area for the past 13 days.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars also were without Jere Lehtinen (ankle), Richard
Matvichuk (knee), Shawn Chambers (hip flexor), Brian Skrudland
(torn rib cartilage), and they lost Jamie Langenbrunner in the
second period with an abdominal strain.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars (45-15-12) are on pace for their greatest season in
franchise history and are almost guaranteed the first overall seed
throughout the playoffs _ a clear time to coast, one would think.
Should glitches like this be expected in an 82-game season?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things we have to battle, but this isn't
just one game,'' Hitchcock said. ``We haven't been consistent over
the past eight or nine games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are 3-3-2 in their past eight games and easily could
have lost a few more. They have scored 14 goals in that span, an
average of 1.75 goals per game. With 10 regular-season games
remaining, the Stars should be taking their game to the next level
and not struggling through their worst slump of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, it's been a struggle,'' center Mike Modano said.
``We've been getting by, but it takes a game like this to really
make you take notice. It's been building, we could all see it
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   With the heavy schedule, the Stars have been practicing
sporadically to preserve strength for games. But with their hardest
stretch of the schedule almost over _ they will have played 16
games, including 10 on the road in March, the Stars likely will
return to the practice ice more often.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting away from our game,'' captain Derian Hatcher
said. ``I think a couple of good practices and some rest would
help.'' SIM TO DEBUT
</P>
<P>
   Jon Sim, a 21-year-old Stars prospect, is expected to make his
NHL debut this afternoon _ and in style. With Lehtinen and
Langenbrunner, Sim has been selected to play left wing on a line
with Mike Modano and Brett Hull.

DUVAL CAPTURES LEAD AT RUGGED SAWGRASS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ PGA Tour officials like to refer to
The Players Championship as the circuit's unofficial ``fifth
major.''
</P>
<P>
   In the estimation of David Duval, the third-round leader at the
TPC at Sawgrass, the $5 million event incorporated aspects of three
major championships yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Players were subjected to greens as severe as Augusta National
Golf Club, home of the Masters Tournament. They endured U.S.
Open-quality roughs and battled breezes that would have been the
pride of any British Open links layout.
</P>
<P>
   The result? Duval, the tour's only two-time winner this season,
shot his worst score of the tournament (74) but still took control
of the leaderboard on a day when the average score was 76.2 at the
7,093-yard, par-72 layout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got kicked around. This may have been the most
difficult scoring conditions I've ever seen in my career. It's
definitely in my top five,'' said Duval, who is at 4 under for the
tournament and is one of only six players remaining in red numbers
through 54 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Duval is being pursued by Phil Mickelson (3 under), Skip Kendall
(3 under) and a three-player group at 1 under that includes Colin
Montgomerie, Scott Hoch and Nick Price. Everyone else is at even
par or higher.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie nodded at the brown-tinged greens and said he
understood why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was in trouble when I got to the first green and
looked down and saw my reflection,'' Montgomerie said. ``They're
awfully slick and shiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson, one of only six players to break par in the third
round with a 71, said he purposely played his second shot at the
par-5 11th hole into a greenside bunker because he could not stop a
5-iron approach on the slick green of the downwind hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not complaining, but think about that for a second. That's
the type of shots we were faced with,'' Mickelson said. ``It was a
great mental challenge on every hole, no question.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the best at handling yesterday's mental challenge was
Fort Worth resident Mark Brooks, who was among the six players who
broke even-par 72 in yesterday's gusty conditions. Brooks improved
42 places on the leaderboard with a 71, leaving him at 3 over for
the tournament and in 25th place heading into today's final round.
</P>
<P>
   One day after surrendering seven strokes to par in his final
seven holes of the second round, Brooks closed with four back-nine
birdies to put himself in contention for his biggest payday of the
season. Brooks' best finish in 1999 was ninth at the Nissan Open,
which netted him $72,800. Brooks, the 1996 PGA champion, has not
earned $100,000 at any PGA Tour event since finishing seventh at
the 1997 TPC.

SPRING'S GOOD, BAD FOR RANGERS

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Entering the final week of spring
training, an evaluation of the '99 Rangers is neither complicated
or out of character.
</P>
<P>
   Success depends upon what?
</P>
<P>
   ``Scoring runs,'' Rudy Jaramillo said yesterday. ``Get three or
four runs early, and then don't let up.''
</P>
<P>
   The baseball multitudes will second his motion. It didn't take
five weeks in the Florida swamps to legitimize this popular theory
on the Rangers _ it's a team that will have to outscore it's own
pitching rotation.
</P>
<P>
   But as the hitting instructor, Jaramillo's words weren't meant
as a commentary on mound woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a commentary on what kind of batting order we have,''
noted Jaramillo. ``It's my way of putting pressure on myself.
Scoring runs is what we should do, not what we will have to do
because of this or that.''
</P>
<P>
   As springs go, this one has been on the cloudy and overcast side
for the Rangers, despite a month of almost solid sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   An evaluation of a club top-heavy in offense:
</P>
<P>
   Good _ Mark McLemore moving like three seasons ago on surgically
repaired (again) knees. If McLemore is as sound as he looks, the
defensive hole at second base is closed, plus the No. 2 spot in the
lineup is plugged.
</P>
<P>
   Bad _ A variety of injuries, lowlighted by John Wetteland's
ankle. The whole season rides on Wetteland being sound.
Bullpen-closer separates the Rangers from divisional foes Anaheim
and Seattle. A positive update is Wetteland threw from the mound
yesterday and again was without pain.
</P>
<P>
   Good _ Early in camp, manager Johnny Oates was on edge, snapping
at the media (which is not all bad), but his demeanor also raised
clubhouse eyebrows. Over the past three weeks, and particularly of
late, Oates has done a 180. He's become Mr. Cool Breeze. The Oates
of old was uptight and defensive. The current kind of Oates is a
much better manager.
</P>
<P>
   Bad _ Not one starting pitcher having an exceptional spring.
Even a good spring would be stretching it. ``It has at least been
consistent,'' said pitching coach Dick Bosman, attempting, I think,
to sound positive. Spring training often means zilch. In this case,
the Rangers hope so. But what does it say about Florida when the
team weakness has been a weakness?
</P>
<P>
   Good _ The emergence of third baseman Todd Zeile. ``I see one
big year coming for Zeile,'' said Jaramillo. ``That he's hitting
eighth for us says a lot about our lineup. I wouldn't hesitate to
say Johnny could hit him fifth if he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad _ Options on trading for a starting pitcher may not be as
numerous as first thought. The Rangers have not been impressed with
Kevin Appier's work this spring. There are rumors of a bone spur in
Kenny Rogers' elbow (although Rogers did have a good Friday outing
in Arizona, with Rangers' scouts watching.) Curt Schilling didn't
list the Rangers among four teams he'd consider if the Phillies
make a trade. The Twins are acting as if Brad Radke is untouchable;
then again, the season hasn't started for the Twins.
</P>
<P>
   Good _ For the moment, Rafael Palmeiro is storming back from two
knee scopes since February. ``Everything points to him being ready
for Opening Day,'' said Jaramillo, after watching Palmeiro
yesterday take batting practice. Rafael was more positive than
that. ``I will open in Arlington \RApril 5\S at first base, or at
the least, as the DH,'' he said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Bad _ Right-hander Esteban Loaiza trudges along, failing to
respond after being openly challenged by Oates, Bosman, etc. With
the best ``stuff'' on the staff, the Rangers hoped for a
breakthrough spring from Loaiza. Instead, he's the same puzzle that
Pittsburgh traded last summer. Remember, the Rangers gave up a nice
prospect, second baseman Warren Morris, in that Loaiza deal. Loaiza
won't be in the rotation and is also close to being bypassed for
long relief duty and shipped out of here.
</P>
<P>
   Good _ Rookie Ruben Mateo has had the kind of spring that almost
_ I said almost _ makes Doug Melvin happy the Roger Clemens trade
escaped the Rangers. Mateo will ``probably'' still open the season
as the Triple-A center fielder, although Oates said, ``I'm going to
keep him with us \Rthis week, including the Arlington exhibition
games\S. I just love to watch him play.'' Mateo's team-first style
and friendly smile are as impressive as his talent. This kid's
attitude is a carbon-copy of a young Sammy Sosa as a Rangers'
farmhand in the late '80s. The scary part is Mateo's talent is
better than Sosa's at the same stage.
</P>
<P>
   Bad _ The Mike Simms injury, which may sideline him until
mid-summer, is bigger than the name Mike Simms implies for most
fans. ``As a part-time right-handed bat, Mike gave our lineup a
run-producing presence that kind of got lost behind all our other
names,'' said Melvin.
</P>
<P>
   Good _ The regular season opens in eight days.
</P>
<P>
   Bad _ Nothing. Not with Opening Day in Arlington just around the
corner.

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Matt Kenseth is going to be big in racing
some day.
</P>
<P>
   He's going to graduate _ with honors _ from the NASCAR Busch
Grand National circuit. He's going to take the Winston Cup series
by storm. He's going to win a lot of prize money. He's going to
give a lot of news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   But not yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Not on a dank and drizzly day when Kenseth, just turned 27,
squandered a victory with the Coca-Cola 300 checkered flag only a
few laps away.
</P>
<P>
   Not yesterday, when Kenseth behaved like the teen-ager who
dented the family car then locked himself in his room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really have any comment,'' Kenseth finally told
reporters who waited for him in the rain for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll talk about it tomorrow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth is one of the lucky ones. He has a tomorrow in this
business.
</P>
<P>
   Today in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series Primestar 500, Kenseth
will be in the bullpen, waiting for the possible call to relieve
the injured Bobby Labonte. In coming weeks, owner Jack Roush has
arranged for Kenseth to drive in five Winston Cup races, as a
prelude to a possible rookie-of-the-year bid in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a pretty big Matt Kenseth fan. I'm a pretty big supporter
of his,'' said driver Mark Martin, whose name will be on the new
Roush Racing team.
</P>
<P>
   Stop me if you've read this before, but Martin won again at
Texas Motor Speedway yesterday. But this one was as much Kenseth's
doing as it was Martin's.
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth was flying along with the greatest of ease. By Lap 7, he
was slingshooting past pole-sitter Dave Blaney and into the lead.
By Lap 95, he was breezing along at 181.702 miles per hour, the
fastest lap of the day. By Lap 140, Kenseth had led 127 of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't going to catch him,'' Martin surmised.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one was.''
</P>
<P>
   On the race's 140th lap, Kenseth pitted under a green flag. When
he emerged, he moved quickly to regain his lead until a collision
between Casey Atwood and Jeff Krogh sent debris flying in Turn 4.
The yellow flag promptly went up. But Kenseth, instead of trusting
his race car, accelerated to try to beat the leader, Jeff Green, to
the start/finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing Kenseth knew, he was on the infield grass, bouncing
and sliding sideways past the starting line _ looking a lot like
that Jeff Gordon Pepsi commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The caution fell at the wrong time,'' said Robbie Reiser, the
owner and crew chief of Kenseth's No. 17 DeWalt Tools Chevy. ``Matt
was doing his best to get us back on the lead lap, and, well, we
just overdid it. It was just one of those things.''
</P>
<P>
   A young driver, you could argue, makes mistakes like that. An
older driver _ a Mark Martin _ would have felt confident that his
car, easily the fastest on the track, would recoup the lost pit
lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tried to get through, but he just didn't have enough
room,'' Reiser said. ``It's one of those deals. He's being hard on
himself. He feels terrible about it. He's thinking he's to blame
when he isn't; we're all in this together.''
</P>
<P>
   While Reiser talked with a small knot of media members, Kenseth
remained in his trailer behind closed doors. But Reiser wasn't
blaming his young driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say enough about Matt Kenseth,'' Reiser said. ``He's a
great race driver. How can I not still be high on him? Matt is an
awesome car driver and an awesome person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be concerned if he ``wasn't'' upset right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in a victory news conference, owner Roush and Martin
admitted that, yes, they have taken the Wisconsin native under
their wing. Last year, in his first full season on the Busch
circuit, Kenseth won three times and finished second in the points
standings.
</P>
<P>
   Roush said he plans to launch Mark Martin Racing and ``help Matt
and Robbie Reiser find their way into Winston Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll be big, they say. One day, Kenseth figures to be Roush's
lead driver. There will be races on Sundays, not rainy Saturdays.
And news conferences to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that Matt's taking it on himself real hard,'' Roush
said. ``But we look forward to the year 2000 with Matt.''
</P>
<P>
   As the rain fell yesterday, though, Matt Kenseth was like the
pouting teen-ager, the one whose impatience had kissed a glorious
day away.
</P>
<P>
   He'll talk ``tomorrow,'' Kenseth said.
</P>
<P>
   They say he'll have many of them.

ANGRY SPURS ROLL OVER WEARY MAVS

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Last night was not a good time to be playing the
San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs were in a rotten mood after the Toronto Raptors paid a
visit and defeated them on Friday night. The short-handed Mavericks
received the brunt of the Spurs' frustration as San Antonio turned
on the jets in the second half and rolled to an easy 99-77 victory
in front of a crowd of 25,921 at the Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured if anybody was going to sneak up on them, it would
be us,'' Mavericks coach/general manager Don Nelson said. ``But
\RToronto\S beat us to it, so we figured they would be mad as
hornets tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson figured right.
</P>
<P>
   Now three-fifths of the way through the season, the Mavericks
are 10-20 and didn't strike any fear in the Spurs after playing
impressively during the first half.
</P>
<P>
   In winning for the 13th time in their past 15 games, the Spurs
(19-10) displayed their superior power in the second half. Despite
playing their third game in three days, the Spurs outscored the
weary-looking Mavericks by 19 points in the final half after
leading by only 44-41 at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said the main reason his team unraveled in the second
half was ``because they're a lot better than we are. We hung in
there for a long time, but then their strength, power and skill got
to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks dressed only 10 players and played without their
most aggressive player, forward Gary Trent, who stayed in Dallas to
nurse a stomach virus. Nelson said he didn't know how much his team
missed Trent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't here,'' he said, ``so you deal without him.''
</P>
<P>
   Trent's absence enabled Samaki Walker to play 18 minutes, and he
responded with a season-high 16 points and six rebounds before
fouling out late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good out there,'' Walker said. ``But we just didn't
answer the call when they got up on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Duncan rebounded from his worst scoring night ever against
Toronto to tally 21 points and grab 15 rebounds against the
Mavericks. By the end of the first quarter, the Spurs led 25-19 and
Duncan had already scored 10 points _ doubling his point total from
the Toronto game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept it three, four, five points most of the game,'' said
center Shawn Bradley, who had 15 points and 12 rebounds. ``But San
Antonio, being the good team that they are, when they got up by 10
points, rather than fold and let us believe that we can win and
sneak one late, they put us away.'' \Nsubheds:Notes Forward Gary
Trent's week-long stomach virus has finally cost him a game.
</P>
<P>
   Trent did not make the trip to San Antonio because of the
ailment. He became ill on March 19 in Detroit on the morning of the
Mavericks' game against the Pistons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just feels weak and sickly,'' Mavericks coach/general
manager Don Nelson said. ``He doesn't look sickly. He may have some
blood tests \Rtoday\S.''
\Nsubheds:BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   With his three blocks last night, Shawn Bradley has 102 blocks
for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has eclipsed the 100-blocked shot barrier in all six of
his NBA seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson will give his players today off. The Mavericks, who
played games the last two nights, will play host to Seattle
tomorrow and play at Minnesota on Tuesday.

CELTICS SHOW LITTLE WORTH WAITING FOR 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Even though it's still very much this year, we are
being told to wait until next year. We can understand why Rick
Pitino can't wait. But every Celtic fan should be asking a simple
question: Why?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Celtics of next year will have had a summer of
workouts, a full training camp, a chance to relearn Pitino's
system, providing he has decided to stick around. But so what?
Every other team, including all those currently ahead of the
Celtics in the standings, will have the same luxury.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a constant with Pitino's teams. He inherits a
train wreck, gets blood from a rock in Year 1 and then makes
progress in Year 2. He did it at Boston University, at Providence,
at New York, and at Kentucky. He's not doing it with the Celtics,
for a number of reasons, some unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   We can blame the lockout, and there is some legitimacy there.
But other than the Nets, what club with even modest expectations
has dropped like a stone this way?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'm missing something, but what exactly is so promising
about next year?
</P>
<P>
   You have Antoine Walker, who is basically the same player he was
three years ago (albeit $71 million richer), has lost none of his
bad habits, and continues to be protected by the organization.
</P>
<P>
   You have a veteran point guard who is disinclined to play the
kind of defense that the coach demands and looks for his own shot.
That's not going to change. (I'd bet that Kenny Anderson is the one
Pitino doesn't especially enjoy coaching.)
</P>
<P>
   You have a promising rookie in Paul Pierce but right now the
basketball court looks like the last place he wants to be.
</P>
<P>
   You also have a coach who has to wonder why he left one of the
three best jobs in college basketball, one in which he had control
over his players and was the undisputed king. You have a coach with
a reputation on the line who's threatening to trade players, who
threatens to bench players and then doesn't do it, who works them
mercilessly and rides them constantly.
</P>
<P>
   And you have players affected by that athletic curse _
``potential'' _ whose hypothetical leader, Walker, was recently
given a choke sign by Ron Harper and dissed by Chuck Person.
</P>
<P>
   What more can we say about Walker? The Celtics made the decision
to build around him, either ignoring or refusing to believe that
they might be building a house of straw. There have been enough
warning signs along the way. You would be surprised, or maybe you
wouldn't, at how many general managers think he's talented but too
much of a selfish bow-wow.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino made his own bed with Anderson. He's got him for four
more years at pretty sizable numbers ($31.73 million). Anderson is
what he is, and he's not going to be magically transformed into
Gary Payton soon. He's a mediocre defender on his best days. He's
best running an offense in a halfcourt set. He's fragile and he's a
career 40 percent shooter. None of this was a trade secret when the
deal was made. (We hear that Pitino hopes defensive-minded Wayne
Turner slips to the second round of the draft.)
</P>
<P>
   Pierce, meanwhile, looks miserable. Is it his ankle, or is it
something else, such as Walker getting in his way, Pitino getting
in his face, or the simple matter of the rookie standing futilely
on the perimeter, waving for the ball as if he's trying to hail a
cab in a rainstorm in Manhattan? We are told that he has been
brought to tears behind closed doors. Here's what he told columnist
Joe Posnanski of the Kansas City Star eight days ago when there was
that ``miscommunication'' problem in New York over the status of
his ankle: ``It was a lot more fun at Kansas. Everybody liked each
other at Kansas.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce said those remarks were made out of frustration and that
he is comfortable in his new surroundings and with new teammates.
We couldn't tell whether his nose was growing.
</P>
<P>
   Now we learn from Sports Illustrated that Pitino wanted to trade
two of his better, unselfish role players, Bruce Bowen and Tony
Battie, for Rodney Rogers, an overweight slug who is a free agent
and would add absolutely nothing. (Bowen and Battie would add
nothing to the Clippers, either, which makes you wonder why either
team wanted to do this.)
</P>
<P>
   This is all supposed to fire us up for next year? Maybe the
Celtics are playing possum. Maybe they're a 50-win team and will
prove us all wrong. One thing they aren't, contrary to the coach's
belief, is an expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino inherited a 30-win team that decided to win 15 games and
succeeded. He could have kept David Wesley, Rick Fox, and Eric
Williams. He elected not to do so and blew it all apart. That was
his choice and we gave him the benefit of the doubt as long as we
saw progress.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, he's got a team going in the wrong direction and
players going through the motions who seem to be rebelling against
him. This is supposed to get us psyched for next year and that
guaranteed playoff berth? I don't know about you, but based on what
I'm seeing, I can't wait.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you're into half-year awards . . . Coach of the Year is a
close race among Pat Riley, Chuck Daly, and Mike Dunleavy. What
Riley has done in Miami with two starters on the shelf is
masterful. He might be getting Jamal Mashburn back soon. Now, if
only the Heat could beat the Pacers. Daly has the Magic battling
Miami and Indiana for the top spot in the East despite eschewing
practices and not getting up close and personal with his players.
He's also doing it with a bench, two rookies, and without a
breakout season from Penny Hardaway. Dunleavy also has a deep team
in Portland and one that can really defend. So far, and we
emphasize it's still early, he has kept the knuckleheads in line
and out of the slammer. The MVP has to be Allen Iverson, with Karl
Malone, Shaquille O'Neal, and possibly Alonzo Mourning in the mix.
The Sixers are a playoff team with Iverson leading the way. If the
Lakers storm away in the West, Shaq will get strong consideration,
as will Malone should the Jazz continue to play well. Mourning and
Tim Hardaway probably will split the Miami vote. As for Rookie of
the Year, it's a three-way battle among early front-runner Pierce,
Vince Carter, and Jason Williams, although Michael Dickerson is
playing major minutes for the suddenly on-a-roll Rockets and the
Magic like their two newcomers, Mike Doleac and Matt Harpring . . .
When Harper gave the choke sign to Walker, it perhaps was a bit out
of line, but it dramatized exactly how he felt. Here's what Harper
had to say about today's young players, of whom Walker is the
prototype: ``You see all these young players on bad teams and the
first thing they tell you is how many points they scored, or how
many slam dunks they had. And I say to them, `What did your team
do?' So many guys don't even talk about that. They don't learn
about the game. They don't care about the game. All they care about
is being on ESPN to see my slam, the pass behind my back, the pass
over my head. They don't care about the game. They care about fancy
cars, stuff like that. In this league, there are so many young
players that everybody says are going to carry the NBA and can do
this or do that. But the older, mature teams always are there. It's
potential. It's something you can build on, after the guys learn
how the game is supposed to be played and how you play as team and
not for yourself.'' . . . Hey Celtics players, take comfort. The
Lakers also got booed on Wednesday night by the Forum faithful
after the Suns jumped on them early. Phoenix lost the lead, but won
down the stretch, as O'Neal managed 1 point in the fourth quarter.
It was LA's first loss with Dennis Rodman playing, and the crowd
even resorted to chants of ``Eddie, Eddie,'' in honor of the
departed Eddie Jones. Luc Longley also finally had a Foster's
moment, delivering an 18-point, 11-rebound effort. Said the Lakers'
Derek Harper, ``We're not there as a team, pure and simple. We're
up, we're down.'' Sounds a lot like what Fox said last week.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We all know about Atlanta's ongoing problem with attendance,
which might be resolved with the new building next season. But only
12,612 showed up in the Georgia Dome for a big game against the
Pacers, and that's too bad. The Hawks won, their second victory
over Indy in eight days. They could be a team to watch over the
second half, especially when LaPhonso Ellis is able to play again.
He has torn tendons in his rib cage, along with back spasms. Talk
about a guy who can't buy a break . . . Informed that the Rockets
were on the verge of finally reaching the .500 mark as a franchise,
coach (and former Rockets player) Rudy Tomjanovich cracked, ``I
can't believe I put the team in such a hole when I was a player.''
Meanwhile, Scottie Pippen remains unhappy with his role there,
voicing concerns that were supported by Harper, with whom he talks
regularly. ``Scottie is not having fun,'' Harper said. ``It's not
the way he plays the game. Here's a guy who can carry a team, who
can do it all. Now, he comes down, he's got Charles Barkley in the
post, Hakeem (Olajuwon), too. You throw it in to them and then go
over and stand around and then if you get the ball back, you shoot
a long-range shot. That's not his game.'' . . . Jeff Van Gundy
canceled Knicks practice Thursday as his team arrived in Phoenix on
the heels of a three-game losing streak. He didn't call a team
lunch, however. The Knicks lost another close one in Sacramento
when Patrick Ewing, again, couldn't connect at the end. New York
was 2-8 in its first 10 games with both Ewing and Latrell Sprewell
in the lineup. The tabloids already are predicting a housecleaning
if things don't turn around soon . . . Minnesota coach Flip
Saunders is agitating for Joe Smith to be named the Most Improved
Player. ``And you know what, he probably leads the league in taking
charges,'' Saunders said. Soon after the game with Boston began,
Smith took a charge from Pierce. ``He gives up his body and takes a
lot of punishment,'' Saunders said . . . The Celtics plan to move
into their new practice facility this week. It's about the only
bright news emanating from the team these days. But even this
development is clouded by the realization that there isn't much
time for practice no matter where they gather.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Even in the days when Boston College wasn't skating to
Hockey East titles and NCAA Tournament berths, the Heights was
turning out future pros by the bunches.
</P>
<P>
   Several have gone on to starry NHL careers, and more than a few
others are scattered throughout the minor leagues. Two former
Eagles have found fame, if not necessarily fortune, in the
International Hockey League. However, their first names and alma
mater seem to be the only other things that Dave Hymovitz and David
Littman have in common.
</P>
<P>
   One scores goals in bunches, the other prevents goals. One has
been out of BC for three years, the other is in his 10th pro
season. One plays in the Midwest, the other in Florida. One is
still waiting for his first call from the NHL, the other has paid a
few quick visits to the world's best league. One likes to light up
the scoreboard, the other wouldn't be averse to seeing his name in
lights someday.
</P>
<P>
   Hymovitz, a left wing, is enjoying a career year with
Indianapolis; his 41 goals rank second in the IHL and are only 10
fewer than he had scored in his two previous years as a pro. With
11 games left, Hymovitz has an outside chance at 50.
</P>
<P>
   Skating most of the season on an all-New England line with
former Boston University star Bob Lachance and South Boston's Brian
Noonan before Noonan was signed two weeks ago by the Phoenix
Coyotes, Hymovitz, a Randolph native, has left his struggling
numbers from last season (11-15_26) far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Hymovitz scored 39 goals with Columbus in the East Coast Hockey
League as a rookie, earning a shot with Indianapolis at the end of
the 1996-97 season. Originally drafted by Chicago in the ninth
round out of Thayer Academy in 1992 before spending four years at
BC, Hymovitz is a free agent in the NHL's eyes, under contract only
to his independent IHL club.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade in pro hockey, Littman is the definition of
journeyman, but the trip the Cranston, R.I., native has taken has
been anything but mundane.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo made Littman the 211th overall pick in the 1987 draft,
and he got into one NHL game a season from 1991-93 with Buffalo and
Tampa Bay. Since then, he has played in Rochester, Phoenix,
Atlanta, Fredericton, Providence, Richmond, Los Angeles, and San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Littman's career appeared finished after he was released
following the 1996-97 season, but Orlando needed a goalie and
signed Littman out of a Los Angeles beer league early the following
year.
</P>
<P>
   He finished ninth in the league in goals against average (2.66)
and, living up to his reputation as a big-game goalie, backstopped
the Solar Bears to the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   His 20 wins are third in the IHL this year, and he has appeared
in a league-high 51 games.
</P>
<P>
   With his time in hockey dwindling, another world is beginning to
open up for Littman. Along with two teammates, one of which is St.
Anselm's Hubie McDonough, Littman appeared in TV ads that won
awards from the Orlando Advertising Federation and have been
nominated for district and national honors.
</P>
<P>
   Littman lived in LA the summer after playing for its IHL
franchise in 1995-96, and spent time as a stuntman and working on
Hollywood sets. For a ``Seinfeld'' and movie devotee, how perfect
would a post-hockey Hollywood career be?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Hockey News has published its annual ``Future Watch'' issue,
a gold mine of information that offers a comprehensive assessment
of the prospects who have already been drafted. The highest-rated
American Hockey League player, at No. 5, is Saint John goalie
Jean-Sebastien Giguere, who has been up with parent club Calgary.
Former BC center Marty Reasoner, who has spent most of the season
in Worcester, is tied for 35th. No current Hockey East players were
among the top 50 . . . Speaking of scouting, Patrik Stefan, a
projected top choice in this June's draft, certainly knows how to
draw a crowd. Some 43 NHL scouts recently gathered to watch Long
Beach's 18-year-old center play an IHL game in Kalamazoo, Mich.
Tampa Bay, which certainly needs help, sent six scouts; some 20
teams were represented . . . With most college teams done for the
year, the annual spring signing flurry has begun. Defenseman Dean
Stork left the University of Massachusetts a year early to sign
with Portland (AHL); he's still enrolled in classes while playing
weekend games with the Pirates. Any chance for independent study
credits? Also, Merrimack's Kris Porter has joined Worcester . . .
Lowell (AHL) has called up former UMass forward Blair Manning from
Louisiana (ECHL).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A team playing on home ice holds a three-goal lead with less
than five minutes remaining. Game over, right? No, the game was
just beginning for Saint John, which scored five times in a span of
4:10 to beat Hartford two weeks ago. With the WolfPack ahead, 5-2,
Martin St. Louis instigated the comeback by scoring with 4:21 to
go. The Flames netted four more goals _ Vermont alum St. Louis
assisting on two to complete a 4-point game _ and Saint John had an
improbable victory . . . Tough break for Bobby Sheehan, who was
forced to retire from Charlotte (ECHL) after suffering his second
concussion in three months. The rookie defenseman from Medford, who
played at Northeastern, has had six concussions in six years . . .
The Calder Cup and a display on the history of the AHL playoffs is
visiting all 19 league cities prior to the playoffs in mid-April.
The tour is due to hit Providence Sunday, New Haven Wednesday, and
Lowell Friday . . . After six seasons, the Portland Pirates have
etched some memorable accomplishments _ a Calder Cup their first
season, a final appearance in another _ so the team has begun a
Hall of Fame. Fans are invited to vote for the three initial
inductees (from 10 nominees) either at games or at
www.portlandpirates.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Success on the ice hasn't been reflected at the box office, so
Lowell will take the unusual step (for a first-place team) of
lowering ticket prices. With the team averaging only 3,294 fans,
next to last in the AHL, the cost of attending a Lock Monsters game
next year will range from $9-$15, down from $11-$22 . . . Make sure
to find a copy of last week's Sports Illustrated and read the
feature on Jesse Boulerice and Andrew Long, who were involved in a
grotesque stick-swinging incident last season in junior hockey.
Boulerice, playing again after a year's suspension, and Long have
spent time in the AHL and ECHL this season but have yet to face
each other . . . Logo of the Week: Pick your own. Hockey fans long
ago discovered the Internet and its multitude of resources. League
and team home pages, statistics, even chat rooms offer a wealth of
information. Along comes www.hockeydb.com, which offers not only
statistics for NHL and minor league teams but also a page on which
the logo of your favorite team _ active or defunct _ appears with
the click of a mouse. So log on and go logo lookin'.

BRUINS' BOTTOM LINE: NOTHING DOING 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Stand Pat behind the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Stand pat in the front office.
</P>
<P>
   And so we saw it again last week, the Bruins' modus operandi
running right to form as the '90s come to a close. The trade
deadline found Boston's NHL entry comfortable and satisfied with
its eighth-place standing in the Eastern Conference, showing no
urge whatsoever to upgrade the lineup, add to the foundation of
talent, as the playoffs approach.
</P>
<P>
   This is no surprise. It's the same tack the front office took
last summer when Mssrs. Harry Sinden and Mike O'Connell opted not
to sign free agents or make trades, content to hand the whole show
back to Pat Burns and ostensibly tell the coach, ``Make a little
more out of the same ol', same ol'.'' They expected Burns to wring
more out of the existing cast and start blending in some of the
kids from Providence.
</P>
<P>
   We know how that went. Some of the returnees got better
(witness: Joe Thornton, Byron Dafoe). Some got worse (witness:
Sergei Samsonov, Dave Ellett, Don Sweeney). A couple of the Baby
B's wannabes even showed a little something (witness: Cameron Mann,
Mattias Timander). By and large, however, Burns has been loathe to
thin the stock with AHL blood, and the Boston roster we now see is
ostensibly the same lot _ a little better here, a little worse
there _ that was bounced in the opening round of last year's
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it makes perfect sense not to tamper with the core of
youth. One only has to look at the implode-while-we-rebuild Celtics
to realize that, at some point, management has to identify its core
players and stick with them. Constantly changing the parts in hopes
of trading up is a strategy doomed for failure. It's never a team.
It's just a bunch of guys in a holding room, wearing the uniform of
the day, waiting to be handed a ticket out of town.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bruins needed to fill out around their youth with some
veteran help. That was true last summer. That was true last week.
It's all the more vivid when the coach, the guy who ultimately
decides who plays and who doesn't, makes it clear through act and
word that he isn't going to start slapping Shawn Bates, Randy
Robitaille, Andre Savage, Terry Virtue, and the rest of the best in
Providence into the Boston lineup come crunch time.
</P>
<P>
   Burns will go with what he knows, take his best shot with those
he feels are proven NHL commodities. Ellett is one of those guys.
That's the same Ellett placed on waivers just before the trade
deadline. That's the same Ellett Burns brought to the Hub when he
was hired as the new coach in the spring of '97.
</P>
<P>
   So, here's what's happening: The front office is telling Burns
to play the kids and he's saying the kids aren't ready; in turn the
front office takes Ellett, a coach favorite and a guy he counts as
one of those to be relied upon, and offers him around the league
for freebies. One side is saying the kid(s) can't play. The other
side is saying the old guy is too slow, overpaid, and can't play.
Hmm. Now there's an afternoon in Camelot.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are equally obstinate. That's the fun in watching
this unfold. Burns is all about winning, in the way he best knows
how. Sinden and O'Connell are all about business, and they keep the
Vault brimming with bucks by assembling a team and a coaching staff
that do just enough to keep one of the most loyal fan bases in all
professional sport hungry for more. If Pavlov had run out of dogs,
he could have substituted either Bruins or Red Sox fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' decision not to beef up the lineup at the trade
deadline will be deadly. There were players available at cheap
prices: Derek Plante, Joe Juneau, Sergei Nemchinov, Wendel Clark.
None of them carried a price past this season. Each could have
added support for the playoffs, filled the jobs that the Baby B's
weren't able to fill last year or this year. An injury or two _ an
absolute guarantee in the postseason _ will leave the Bruins
wishing they had paid more attention last week when there was help
to be had.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, too, that ultimately Burns will have no choice but
to go with the kids, be it the next few weeks or be it next autumn.
The front office non-moves in the past nine months have made that
abundantly clear. Putting Ellett on waivers said it even more
profoundly. Trades? Improvements? Free-agent upgrades? Forget it,
coach. Those days are done. Grab a gallon of Clearasil if you have
to, get a primer on Generation X and, you know, like, go to work.
Cool.
</P>
<P>
   What if Burns won't do the job as deemed by the front office?
Then the next kid in town will be Peter Laviolette, the Providence
coach. Last week proved Causeway Street is all about control, cash,
and kids.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unless someone really catches fire, no one in the NHL will score
50 goals this season. That hasn't happened since the Bruins' Phil
Esposito popped in a league-leading 43 in 1969-70 (a Cup season in
Boston). Remember, this will be the first year the league presents
the Rocket Richard award to the leading scorer. ``I don't think
they should give anyone the trophy if they don't score 50,'' kidded
Anaheim's Teemu Selanne. ``The goalies are too good _ we need
bigger nets.'' The Rocket was the first NHLer to collect 50 goals
in a season . . . Before the Canadiens sent him to the Sharks, the
Oilers toyed with the idea of bringing Vincent Damphousse back to
Edmonton, where he collected 89 points in '91-92. The rental fee
would have been some $500,000 over 26 days, a price general manager
Glen Sather knew was too steep for Oiler ownership. In case you
missed it, Damphousse popped in two goals in his Sharks debut . . .
Peter Zezel's season came to a bizarre end Tuesday when he refused
a trade from Vancouver to Anaheim _ where he was projected as
relief for center Steve Rucchin. Zezel refused to report to the
Ducks, because he doesn't want to spend time away from his
3-year-old niece, who is terminally ill. ``If I'm not with my
family, I'll regret it the rest of my life,'' said Zezel. The deal
was voided and the Canucks bought out the last month of Zezel's
contract, contributed an equal amount, and will use the total to
set up a charity in the child's name . . . Ex-Boston University
star Chris O'Sullivan, of the Dorchester O'Sullivans, was dished to
the Rangers. O'Sullivan's skills are smooth but he didn't have the
requisite crusty edge to suit Flames coach Brian Sutter. The
Blueshirts assigned O'Sullivan to Hartford (AHL) . . . Actress
Susan Sarandon, in an interview last Sunday with Barbara Walters,
when asked if she and companion Tim Robbins had it all: ``If the
Rangers were to win the Stanley Cup, then we'd have it all.'' . . .
The April 5 edition of ESPN The Magazine carries a revealing piece
on Toronto netminder Curtis Joseph. Born in 1967 _ three days
before the Leafs last won the Cup _ CuJo was adopted by a couple
who owned and operated the Martin Acres Home for Special Care in
Sharon, Ontario. He was one of four children who shared living
quarters with 20 mentally disabled adult males. CuJo: ``It was a
big house with lots of rooms. It was pretty lonely. When I was old
enough, I used to look forward to going to school. I guess some
good comes out of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa forward Bill Berg to the Ottawa Sun after the Bruins' 3-0
victory over the Senators last week: ``If that was a preview of the
first round, then we'd better realize we're going to be in for a
tough playoff series.'' . . . Word around the NHL is that up to a
dozen clubs have expressed interest in signing free agent Jason
Krog, the University of New Hampshire center considered by many to
be the favorite to win the Hobey Baker Award . . . Even the steady,
successful Stars did some late roster augmentation, adding alum
Benoit Hogue (from Tampa) and picking up the speedy Plante from
Buffalo for a second-rounder. Also added to the mix: Blake Sloan, a
feisty forward they signed out of the IHL (Houston) on March 10.
The trio gives Dallas the kind of depth head coach Ken Hitchcock
could have used last season to make a real run at the Red Wings . .
. The Kings did the expected and bought out Steve Duchesne's deal
for $4.25 million, then re-signed him for this year and shipped him
to the Flyers for Dave Babych. When the year ends, Duchesne will
have been paid $8 million for the year and will be an unrestricted
free agent again. ``A valuable lesson,'' said Kings GM Dave Taylor,
who seriously doubts that he'll go shopping again in the overpriced
free-agent market . . . Cramer Productions in Norwood again is
staging an NHL playoff fantasy draft to benefit the Foundation of
Fighting Blindness. Interested would-be GMs can call:
1-800-683-5555 to book an April 20 reservation . . . The Bruins
recently lost one of their most royal rooters with the passing of
Gloucester's Peggy Marshall, a season ticket-holder for the past 20
years. Marshall sat in the first row near the Zamboni entrance,
alongside pals Marje Bishop and Gary Levin, and made sure that
everyone _ refs included _ went by the rulebook . . . In his
appreciative remarks upon welcoming Nemchinov to New Jersey, Devils
coach Robbie Ftorek reminded one and all that the skilled Russian
played on the Olympic team between Alex Mogilny and Pavel Bure.
Right line, wrong church. The three once rode together, but in the
World Championships. The point is still valid: Nemchinov, virtually
lost on Long Island, can be a real asset even at age 35 . . .
Zigmund Palffy, regarding the Islanders' plight, in comments to
Newsday: ``I thought we were going to build a good team here.'' . .
. The Flyers last week added _ hold on to your double-runners _ a
skating coach, ex-Canadian speedskater David Roy. Now that's
cutting-edge stuff . . . The Red Wings took Bill Ranford (one win,
$3 million this year) off the Lightning's hands on trade day,
easing about $500,000 off the Bolts' payroll this year. If the Red
Wings don't want Ranford next year _ and he doesn't get grabbed by
Atlanta in the expansion _ the Bolts will have to pick up a portion
of his 1999-2000 salary . . . When the Leafs acquired Yanic
Perreault from LA at the trade deadline, it meant Kevyn Adams,
another onetime Bruins first-rounder, had to head back to the
minors (St. John's) . . . The Capitals trimmed back payroll
significantly with an 11th-hour salary dump (including Juneau to
the Sabres), but they'd still like to unload Dmitri Mironov and
Michal Pivonka . . . Just like the Bruins, the Capitals are going
to reconfigure their ticket-price structure, perhaps dropping some
season-ticket prices at MCI Center by as much as 50 percent . . .
Don't look for Juneau to sign in Buffalo over the summer. An
unrestricted free agent, he's on record as wanting to sign with
Ottawa, but someone will pay him upwards of $3 million a year, and
that won't be the fiscally sensible Senators . . . The Islanders'
Craig Janney recently required hospitalization to thin out a blood
clot in one of his legs, ending his season. No truth to the rumors
that doctors found traces of Esa Tikkanen's bite marks on Janney's
heels and elbows, left over from the '88 and '90 Cup finals.

<P>
   ANAHEIM _ It was the best of teams, it was the worst of teams.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the neck you'd expect to find in the guillotine.
</P>
<P>
   It was the night when the junkyard dogs - riding that bad
attitude after weeks of teasing -- finally caught the neighborhood
hooligans on the wrong side of the fence.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Utah Jazz -- checking in as the NBA's best team,
relative to post-season pedigree - having their egos spanked
Saturday by the Clippers, 103-77, in front of 14,293 fans who
should save those ticket stubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a superb game of basketball for 48 minutes,'' said
Clipper coach Chris Ford, whose team recently has been good for
about 36.
</P>
<P>
   It was a night when Utah's Karl Malone, who usually receives
more calls than A-list telethons, was granted two technical fouls
and subsequently ordered to leave the premises. Malone, whose Hall
of Fame elbows became familiar with the chin of Clipper forward
Maurice Taylor, was booted at 9:44 of the third quarter after
clipping Taylor on a rebound skirmish.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really pissed me off,'' the young Clipper said. ``I told
him to quit whining about the calls, too. I know we go back there
(Utah) one more time, but I don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who has made a habit of avoiding rebounds (he somehow
finished with zero), decided he wouldn't avoid this confrontation.
While teammates held him back, the second-year ex-Michigan star
clobbered Malone with more harsh language.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to look up to him, sort of,'' Taylor said of power
forward role model Malone. ``From now on, he's just another another
(compound expletive) on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches from both teams left their benches to restore order.
Utah coach Jerry Sloan talked his way into a technical of his own.
</P>
<P>
   When the chitchat ended, the Clippers held a 59-36 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the real turning point was the opening tip-off.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers (3-24), who keep threatening to commit basketball,
smothered the defending Western Conference champions from jump
street. The ringleader was rookie center Michael Olowokandi, who
defied the doomsday prophecy of Clipper draft critics by scoring
nine points and tracking down nine rebounds in the opening quarter.
</P>
<P>
   He finished with 15 points and 13 rebounds. Rookie forward
Tyrone Nesby and shooting guard Eric Piatkowski were in cahoots
with Olowokandi, the former scoring 16 points and snagging seven
rebounds, while the latter scored a game-high 18 points. Lamond
Murray added 15 off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Malone missed six of his seven field-goal attempts, finishing
with seven points and ending his consecutive double-figure-scoring
streak at 575 games. Jacque Vaughn, Jeff Hornacek and Todd Fuller
led Utah (21-7) in scoring with ... 10 points apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers had a 52-32 edge at intermission, and increased the
lead to 79-54 through three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   When did Ford feel comfy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Never, really,'' said Ford, a student of recent history.
``It's just nice to see the guys rewarded.''
</P>
<P>
   The fourth quarter was a vintage edition of garbage time, with
the Clippers - in a casting change - refusing to hang from the back
of the truck.

BRUINS GET POINT OF TRIP TO TORONTO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ For better than 52 minutes, the Bruins had control.
For better than 52 minutes, the Bruins had it won.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem was: Regulation lasts 60 minutes. In those
final minutes of the third period, the Bruins surrendered a 2-0
lead, giving up goals at 12:42 and 19:01, and were forced to settle
for a 2-2 tie with the high-flying Maple Leafs Saturday &UR;  &LR; night at
the Air Canada Centre.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were just 7 minutes 18 seconds from a clean getaway
after playing a nearly flawless first two-plus periods. The Bruins
had received a boost in the afternoon when the Rangers lost to
Philadelphia and had an opportunity to do themselves a bigger
service by winning. However, they ran out of gas, playing their
fifth game in eight days.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give the puck to the best offensive team in the NHL,
sooner or later, they're going to give it back to you (in the form
of a goal),'' said coach Pat Burns. ``We gave them the puck for one
goal . . . but it was a big point for us. We had a lot of good
chances to win the game and (goalie Curtis Joseph) was on top of
his game. He made some tremendous saves to keep them in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be satisfied with the point, we've got to be
disappointed with the point we lost, but I'm satisfied with the
point we got.''
</P>
<P>
   With 10 games remaining, Boston has a six-point lead over the
idle Florida Panthers and seven-point advantage over the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins finished the season series with the Leafs at 3-1-1,
the only loss coming in their final appearance at Maple Leaf
Gardens Jan. 9 with Ray Bourque sidelined by an injury.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Boston increased its unbeaten streak to six games
(3-0-3). The club is 5-1-3 in its last nine.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bourque who put the Bruins ahead, 1-0, with a power-play
goal at 8:11 of the first period. Bourque scored from the point,
giving him 10 goals for the season, eight of which have come with
the man advantage. The score tied Bourque with fading Carolina
Hurricane Paul Coffey for most career goals by a defenseman (385).
In 45 games this season, Coffey has just two goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs thought they had tied the game at 2:38 of the
second. Right wing Mike Johnson, who was skating right to left
behind the Boston net, dished the puck to center Steve Sullivan.
Sullivan skated out from behind the cage and fired a wraparound
past Byron Dafoe at the left post. But the video replay showed that
left wing Derek King was in the crease and the goal was disallowed.
</P>
<P>
   Less than four minutes later, the Bruins made it a two-goal lead
on Joe Thornton's 13th of the season. As a penalty to Fredrik Modin
for interfering with Dafoe was expiring, Thornton blasted a shot
from long range that sailed past Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   Boston could have had more. Anson Carter rattled a shot off the
post in the waning seconds of the period with the Bruins on a power
play that carried over into the third.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout much of the contest, the Bruins handcuffed the Leafs
offensively, holding the home team to a measly two shots in the
second.
</P>
<P>
   Burns asked his players at the morning skate which was the
highest-scoring team in the league. ``They all knew the answer,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs went into Saturday &UR;  &LR; night with 229 goals,
significantly more than any team in the Eastern Conference. Until
the third period, the Bruins played an ugly road game, clogging the
middle of the ice, trapping like crazy, and stifling any
run-and-gun ambitions the Maple Leafs had.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the polite fans screamed, ``Boring, boring,'' but
it was a style that played right into Boston's hands.
</P>
<P>
   That changed dramatically in the third. The Maple Leafs pulled
to within a goal at 12:42, a result of one of the few Bruins
mistakes. Don Sweeney was stripped of the puck and right wing
Sergei Berezin ended up flipping the puck at the net from high
between the circles, beating Dafoe to the glove side.
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs came to life after the goal, putting their first real
heat on the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   They then cashed in another chance, tying the game with 58.7
seconds remaining in regulation. Not long after Landon Wilson had a
great opportunity denied by Joseph, defenseman Daniil Markov took a
centering pass from Sullivan with Joseph pulled for an extra
attacker and beat Dafoe from the slot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played a lot of games in the last while,'' said Burns,
``but I thought we handled it pretty good. You can't give the puck
to the best offensive team in the league and not expect them to
score.''

INDEPENDENT VIDEO STORES FEEL SQUEEZED BY BIG-CHAIN RENTAL BARNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Call it the Monster that Ate Mom and Pop, as in
mom-and-pop video stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having the hardest time of my life,'' said Mark Tusher,
owner of three Alamo Video stores in Simi Valley northwest of Los
Angeles. ``Even strong independents like myself are suffering
everywhere. We've just been ravaged.''
</P>
<P>
   The devourers are the nation's two major videocassette rental
chains, Blockbuster and Hollywood Video, with much more than 5,000
outlets. Now dubbed ``Hollybuster'' in the trade press, the giants
have rolled across the land thanks to a new strategy dubbed ``copy
depth,'' in which they buy enormous quantities of new titles at
reduced rates and guarantee they'll be in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Blockbuster, which will be spun off from Viacom Inc. this year,
has become particularly aggressive, both at building up its copy
depth and at building its stores. It had already planned to add
1,000 stores to its U.S. empire of more than 4,000 outlets and then
recently announced plans for 500 ``fill-in'' stores this year. In
other words, ``Big Blue'' will be everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has been impressed. Viacom stock, which had been
dragged down by Blockbuster in the mid-'90s, has tripled in value
in two years; Hollywood Entertainment, parent of Hollywood Video,
is up 50percent over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The losers are the independents, which comprise two-thirds of
the nation's 27,000 video rental outlets. Once a staple of strip
malls everywhere, smaller video mom-and-pop outlets are vanishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The independents are not doing very well because the big
stores are driving them out of business,'' said Richard Leyner, a
broker with Capital Commercial. ``We see vacancies from video
stores even though the overall commercial vacancy rate is very
low.''
</P>
<P>
   The Video Software Dealers Association believes nationwide store
count could drop by 10 percent this year; Ron Berger, chief
executive officer of wholesale specialist Rentrak, estimates 400 to
500 indie outlets are closing per month with about a third of those
replaced by major chain outlets; and Blockbuster has been shopping
a plan for indies to convert stores to Blockbuster outlets.
</P>
<P>
   It's an amazing turnaround for Blockbuster, which was on the
verge of collapse two years ago before dropping an ill-fated
diversification strategy and focusing on a ``Go Home Happy''
campaign that promised that new titles would be in stock. Analysts
now believe Blockbuster has the potential to control half the
nation's rental market, estimated at $8 billion to $10 billion
annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've been dedicated to doing is satisfying the consumer
for the past year and a half,'' said Blockbuster spokeswoman Karen
Raskopf, noting that walk-out rates _ customers leaving without
making a purchase _ had been as high as 20 percent previously.
``They told us loud and clear in focus groups that they wanted new
product guaranteed in stock and priced competitively.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Roffman, an investor with a large position in Blockbuster
parent Viacom, predicted many indies will disappear, much like Meg
Ryan's bookstore closed after Tom Hanks opened a megastore nearby
in the movie ``You've Got Mail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're living in an age of massive consolidation of every
industry from bookstores to breweries,'' said Roffman, principal of
Roffman Miller Associates in Philadelphia. ``Blockbuster is
succeeding because it finally addressed the major customer concern
of not being able to get the tape you wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger, a VSDA board member, said indies are doomed because they
can't match the marketing ability of the majors. In addition, and
probably more importantly, the independent video retailers aren't
large enough to participate in most revenue-sharing deals, under
which studios sell tapes to stores for $5 or less in exchange for a
revenue split.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blockbuster and Hollywood have the marketing strengths and ad
budgets and physical presence, if you will, to have copy depth,''
Berger said. ``They have the ability to simply outspend rivals and
create a far bigger presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Local indies believe ``Hollybuster'' is targeting them for
extinction. ``You're seeing nice stores with loyal clienteles close
down simply because Blockbuster wants market share,'' Tusher
asserted. ``No one is making any money right now because
Blockbuster is buying 10 times more copies than they need.''
</P>
<P>
   All this comes at a time the video industry remains one of the
great success stories of the last 20 years, generating $20 billion
this year from sales and rentals just in the United States. The
soaring popularity of the DVD format will probably add years of
robust life to the industry.
</P>
<P>
   But with so much at stake and so many players, it's no surprise
that there's plenty of turmoil:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Independent Video Retailers Group has been threatening to
sue Blockbuster and major studios over unfair pricing and
revenue-sharing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rentrak, which supplies more than 10,000 stores, and 20th
Century Fox have sued Hollywood Video's parent over underreporting
sales figures; Hollywood claims Rentrak misinformed Fox.
</P>
<P>
   _ A video store owner in Carmel filed an antitrust suit against
Blockbuster over a deal it signed giving the chain exclusive rights
to 45 movies from Showtime, Trimark and October Films; the New
England Buying Group called for a boycott of Trimark and October
titles.
</P>
<P>
   _ Revenue-sharing and the growing complexity of the video
business is forcing major supermarkets to abandon rentals.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   _ Distributors are complaining that indies are forming informal
buying groups to maximize buying power.
</P>
<P>
   _ VSDA President Jeff Eves resigned in January amid criticism
that he favored the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Indie retailers are not shy about placing the blame. ``I
personally feel that what Blockbuster is doing is predatory
pricing,'' said Alan Kirk, owner of Video Super Shop in Ventura,
northwest of Los Angeles. ``If I want to do revenue-sharing, I
can't get the same terms because I have to go through a distributor
like Rentrak rather than deal directly with the studio.''
</P>
<P>
   Blockbuster's Raskopf denied the predatory pricing allegation,
adding, ``Our goal is most assuredly not to drive prices down; it
is to make sure we're priced competitively.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Salzer, owner of Salzer's Videos in Ventura, and a VSDA
board member, said the studios are also to blame. Indies must set
up a special buying program for every movie, and stores are often
required to purchase far more tapes than they need, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting a lot of messages that we no longer matter in
the scheme of things,'' said Salzer, who opened his store more than
a decade ago. ``It's an unlevel field for indies to play on.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Salzer acknowledged, Blockbuster and Hollywood
have changed the behavior of the customer by stressing the
availability of new titles and then flooding the walls with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be the customers needed to be somewhat
unsatisfied,'' he said. ``It's always worked this way _ you build
up the desire for new product and offer plenty of other things, so
customers aren't conditioned to go after the latest and the
greatest. Now, Blockbuster and Hollywood are conditioning them to
look for nothing but new titles like `Rush Hour,' `There's
Something About Mary,' `The Truman Show.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Kirk agrees. ``The customer used to say, `I'll rent something
else,' but the customer has been trained to feel that they'll get
their first choice,'' he said. ``So I've spent a tremendous amount
of money, about three times as much as I normally would have, on
new titles. You have to adjust _ if that's what they want, you have
to have it.''
</P>
<P>
   And staying alive requires more than spending more, Kirk noted.
``I've got my boxing gloves on every day,'' he said, contending
that his store has better service and a better feel for the needs
of customers, in addition to supporting local community
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell people that if the indies go out of business, the
consumers lose because then the corporate stores have total control
over pricing,'' Kirk said. ``When competition is dead and gone,
it's dangerous for consumers as well.''

NOT MUCH ELBOW ROOM FOR RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ There are 11 players still on the Red Sox
roster who will not be there on Easter, when general manager Dan
Duquette must submit his Opening Day list of 25 players to the
American League office.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Tim Harikkala doesn't look that far ahead. He takes a
far more pragmatic view of his tenuous status in camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every week you get big-league meal money is a bonus,'' he said
Saturday after pitching three scoreless innings in the Red Sox'
4-4, 10-inning tie with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   With Bret Saberhagen needing a couple of extra days after
developing a knot at the bottom of his right shoulder, Jimy
Williams needed another starter Saturday. How did he settle on
Harikkala?
</P>
<P>
   ``Like this,'' Williams said, taking off his cap and pretending
to reach in and draw out a name.
</P>
<P>
   Williams could afford to be casual about such matters because
his five-man rotation is set. The decisions must still be made in
the bullpen, where Harikkala is one of seven pitchers _ and a long
shot candidate at that _ for one, and possibly two, jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Four spots in the bullpen are assured: closer Tom Gordon, setup
men Jim Corsi and Derek Lowe, and lefthanded specialist Mark
Guthrie. John Wasdin, even though he has allowed 18 hits and 7
earned runs in just 12 1/3 innings (including tape-measure home
runs to Cecil Fielder and Marty Cordova in the last week), has the
inside track for the long-relief position.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave one position open. The favorites for that job
are Kip Gross, the returning Japanese import who has a big-league
deal with the club and has said he'll go back to Japan before he
goes to the minors; and Brad Clontz, who appeared in 140 games in
two seasons with the Braves as a setup man and says he's healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Lefthander Rheal Cormier, who worked two snappy scoreless
innings Saturday, also would loom as a candidate, except the Sox
seem to feel that Cormier, on his second go-round with Boston with
a major elbow surgery in between, needs to build up more arm
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Harikkala, a 27-year-old righthander who five years ago was
named the Mariners' Minor League Pitcher of the Year but hasn't
sniffed the big leagues since 1996, is here as a nonroster invitee.
This is the deepest he's ever stuck with a big-league club in camp,
but he's a realist.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start thinking about (the cutdown date), you'd drive
yourself nuts,'' he said. ``You just do the best you can, and let
the results speak for themselves. Hopefully, you make it tough for
them to make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Clontz, who did not pitch Saturday, has a save and a win in his
last two appearances. The submarining righthander, who appeared in
two World Series for the Braves but was back in the minors in '97
and played with both the Dodgers and Mets last season before
undergoing elbow surgery, also is a nonroster invitee here. But he
has far more big-league experience than Harikkala, and is
well-known by Williams, who was a coach with the Braves when Clontz
was thriving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm healthy, pitching without pain, for the first
time since the middle of '96,'' said the shaven-headed Clontz, a
Virginia native who played college ball at Virginia Tech and
thought that the discomfort he began to feel with the Braves was
just something he had to pitch through.
</P>
<P>
   Clontz said that last September, David Altchek, the Mets' team
doctor who performed Saberhagen's shoulder surgery, took out two
bone spurs and five ``large-sized'' chips from his elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I've got a new attitude,'' Clontz said. ``Before, it hurt
me to throw my slider, so I stopped throwing it. Now, my slider is
a lot sharper, and I can snap it off. I don't have to baby my
elbow. Everything is free and loose.''
</P>
<P>
   If Clontz, who will be 28 next month, is anything like the
pitcher who used to set up for Mark Wohlers of the Braves, he will
represent a significant upgrade for the bullpen. His slider, coming
out of his near-underhanded motion, is a very difficult pitch for
righthanded hitters to pick up.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason I came here is because I thought I'd have an
opportunity to fit in, to reestablish myself,'' Clontz said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he hasn't made any decisions yet, and may defer
them until next weekend, when the Sox play their last two
exhibitions in Denver against the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll keep an open mind,'' he said. ``For some of these kids,
even though it's just spring training, these games are like playoff
games.''

CHUCKLE COST UP, INDEX SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ We're paying bigger fees for smaller tee-hees,
according to the 1999 Cost of Laughing Index.
</P>
<P>
   For the third year in a row, the index of 17 comical indicators
rose 3 percent, reflecting a gain in the minimum fee for sitcom
writing and a jump in the fee for a singing chicken telegram.
However, the price of a dozen rubber chickens has fallen (from $66
to $60), partially offsetting the other increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 3 percent increase is no laughing matter,'' said author and
humor consultant Malcolm Kushner, who has been publishing the index
on or around April Fool's Day since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The index consists of 17 indicators, including admission prices
to 10 comedy clubs across the country, Mad magazine's newsstand
price ($2.50) and a dozen Groucho glasses ($15). The only other
indicator to fall was admission to Atlanta's Punchline club, down
to $14 from $15.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner, the author of ``Successful Presentations for Dummies,''
was enthused about taking advantage of the decline in
rubber-chicken prices as a way to shore up Social Security. ``Now
the government can afford to put a rubber chicken in every pot,''
he quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner's full-time job is running a Santa Cruz-based consulting
business under which he gives speeches to corporations and
associations. But rather than offering instruction in workplace
joke-telling, he advises audiences to be careful in using humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep it clean and don't be mean,'' he said.

PENN LESS EFFECTIVE VS. MOORE 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Ricky Moore had the basic high school
BMOC scorer's resume: 21 points a game his senior year at Westside
High in Augusta, Ga., with a high of 37.
</P>
<P>
   But ego reduction is a fact of life for all but the very chosen
few in college basketball. In the fall, All-State quarterbacks are
turned into cornerbacks, and most of them are not very happy about
it when the idea is first presented to them. So, too, in
basketball, are offensive stars required to make very serious
physical and mental adjustments, some more than others. Ricky
Moore's came when Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun told him he could
forget about shooting it 12 or 15 times a game. The mentor had
something else in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needed to find a place,'' explained Calhoun after a 64-58
victory over Ohio State sent his team into Monday night's national
championship game at Tropicana Field against Duke. ``We sold him on
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   On an evening when slender, glider-supreme Richard ``Rip''
Hamilton sliced through the Buckeye defense for 24 points and when
lovable point guard Khalid El-Amin submitted one of his Picassos
with 18 points, 6 assists, and a number of momentum-busting plays,
Moore, son of an Augusta National caddie, may have stood taller
than any other Husky. Moore's job was to make sure that Scoonie
Penn would not enjoy his trip to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   The Penn line pretty much says it all. Ohio State's floor leader
was held to 11 points on 3-for-13 shooting to go with a manageable
four assists. He seldomly was allowed to penetrate into the lane.
Coming off a truly spectacular South regional in which he not only
had taken Ohio State to the Final Four but also had elevated his
status in the eyes of the pro scouts, Scoonie was very, very
mortal. He was just another 5 foot 9 inch guy.
</P>
<P>
   And he knew it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky Moore was tremendous,'' saluted Penn. ``He may not have
scored 24 points, but he was the MVP in this game tonight. When he
took me out of the game, it affected the way our offense was run.''
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing overtly cerebral about the Calhoun approach to
the Scoonie Penn problem. He simply said to Moore, ``You've got the
little guy,'' and then watched his senior human postage stamp affix
himself to the oft-frustrated Ohio State point guard.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun has seen it all before. He has put Moore on every
quality guard unfortunate enough to be on the Connecticut schedule,
and he really had no reason to expect the results to be any
different, NCAA national semifinal game or no NCAA national
semifinal game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Scoonie Penn is going to make money playing
professional basketball,'' said Calhoun. ``But this year we've seen
Mateen Cleaves (Michigan State) and Arthur Lee (Stanford) and
everyone in the Big East, and Moore has continually done what he
did today. Basically, what we did was cut the head off the body. We
watched Ohio State on tape and as Scoonie Penn goes, so goes Ohio
State.''
</P>
<P>
   Auburn and St. John's would each second that motion. Scoonie
abused them for 48 points, 12 assists, and even 11 rebounds last
week in Knoxville. Aside from a pair of open first-half threes and
one patented, snake-like slither to the hoop in the second half,
Penn's personal offense was kept under control by the 6-2 Moore.
And at no time did Scoonie penetrate into the lane for a dish-off
to, say Michael Redd, the Ohio State scoring machine. The head
Calhoun was alluding to was lying on the Tropicana Field floor
somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to take the drive away,'' said Moore, who, in
fact, took the drive away.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a solo effort, but these things never are. Very few
modern teams play strict, straight-up, 100 percent, man-to-man
defense. Individuals are instructed to be aware of what's going on
around them. They are expected to double-team a roving opponent
when necessary, and in so doing they might run the risk of having
their own man break free for a score.
</P>
<P>
   Moore had no such responsibility in this game. Calhoun was
confident enough in the ability of the other UConn men to contain
the Ohio State threats _ Redd, specifically _ so that Moore could
concentrate on his one job, to stop Penn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every other team helps out on Michael Redd,'' sighed Penn.
``Not UConn. Ricky Moore stayed with me all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State coach Jim O'Brien knew where the game was decided.
``Ricky Moore deserves an awful lot of credit,'' he said. ``He made
Scoonie work for the entire 40 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Guarding Penn wasn't all Moore did during his productive 37
minutes of work. He also found time to lead the Huskies with eight
rebounds. His 6 points on 1-for-7 shooting were almost immaterial.
</P>
<P>
   Moore is matter-of-fact about the whole thing. ``I'm still a
good offensive player, as well as a good defensive player,'' he
maintains. ``It doesn't matter to me. I knew I could stop people. I
just want to win games. I took on that role when he asked. I had no
problem with it.''
</P>
<P>
   He will always know that his efforts have been appreciated by
his coach. ``I've had a lot of good defensive players,'' Calhoun
declared. ``Ricky Moore is the best.''
</P>
<P>
   It may have taken the best to stop Scoonie Penn, because he was
the hottest guard in America. You'd have to think that Jim Calhoun
will always have a soft spot in his heart for Augusta, Ga.

BLUE DEVILS MOVE ON

 STATE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ OK, so this had nothing to do with any
confounding losing streak Boston Coll . . . er, Ohio State
basketball coach Jim O'Brien had in his previous 18 head-to-head
matchups against Jim Calhoun and his Connecticut Huskies. UConn's
decisive 64-58 victory over the Eag . . . er, Buckeyes in the first
game of Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's national semifinal doubleheader before
41,340 at Tropicana Field had little to do with O'Brien's ancient
history against his former Big East rival.
</P>
<P>
   It's more to do with the fact that Calhoun's team, once again,
proved to be the better of the two on the court. It had more to do
with the defensive straitjacket Ricky Moore threw on BC's . . . er,
Ohio State's Scoonie Penn, limiting the Buckeye catalyst to 11
points on 3-for-13 shooting. It had more to do with the effort of
Richard Hamilton, who eclipsed the 2,000-point mark for his career
with a game-high 24 points on 10-for-17 shooting, as well as an
Ohio State team that missed 40 more shots than it made (23) and
committed 11 turnovers that led to 21 easy transition points for
the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, no matter how much had changed for O'Brien, and the
members of his staff he imported from Chestnut Hill to Columbus,
since the last time he coached against UConn, one thing remained
painfully unchanged: His record against Calhoun. Eighteen times the
same scenario has played itself out _ like Bill Murray's wake-up
scene in ``Groundhog Day'' _ with Calhoun walking to midcourt to
extend a conciliatory hand to a bitterly disappointed O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   The 19th time around proved no different for the two men, with
two notable exceptions: the Final Four setting and the high stakes
of a possible national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a better team today and we had better players, and
that's why we won,'' explained Calhoun, who now has guided his team
(33-2) to unprecedented heights with a berth in Monday night's
title game. ``We had Ricky Moore on our side to stop Scoonie, who's
a great, great player.
</P>
<P>
   ``As our life has gone back and forth, (O'Brien) gets as much
out of his basketball team than anyone I know. They're a Final Four
team, sure. But they've faced a lot of tough teams and they're here
and that's a tremendous credit to him and, as I said to him, I
don't know of anybody who's more efficient at coaching than Jimmy
O'Brien. I mean they get everything done and they get all their
players involved.''
</P>
<P>
   And now the Buckeyes share O'Brien's stigma of losing to UConn,
but on much grander scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a good team,'' O'Brien said when asked if anything
about UConn had changed since he last faced them. ``They're one of
the better teams in the country. They played like it tonight. They
played every bit to the level that we anticipated they would
play.''
</P>
<P>
   So what did he say to Calhoun at the end, when both coaches met
at midcourt?
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations,'' O'Brien said, ``And good luck on Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien was hoping to hear those same words from Calhoun, and by
halftime, it appeared as though he would. The Buckeyes rallied from
a 32-23 deficit in the first half by going on a 10-0 run to take a
33-32 lead on an offensive putback by Michael Redd, who led Ohio
State (27-9) with 15 points on 7-for-18 shooting. But as they've
done all season, Hamilton and Khalid El-Amin, the chunky sparkplug
of a guard who chipped in 18 points, rose up and scored huge
baskets that gave UConn a 36-33 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Singleton, who led the Buckeyes with 9 first-half points,
pulled Ohio State within 1, 36-35, at halftime when he nailed a
jumper and then combined with Ken Johnson, who swatted Ed Saunders
underneath, on a pair of huge blocked shots. Singleton stuffed a
Hamilton attempt on the ensuing inbounds play, inciting a shoving
match that only seemed to fire up the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think definitely in the first half we really had them on the
ropes,'' El-Amin said. ``At the same time, we got kind of relaxed
on offense and we tried to beat our men one-on-one. That caused
them to get a couple of turnovers and score easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes erased a 51-41 deficit to pull within 57-54 on
Redd's fast-break basket, but with 2:50 remaining, the Huskies put
the game out of reach in an amazing sequence when Jake Voskuhl
mishandled a backcourt pass, almost passing it to himself, before
El-Amin alertly called timeout. Then, before he fouled out with
1:24 to go, Voskuhl saved a loose ball and fed it to Hamilton for
an absolute dagger of a jumper that lifted UConn to a 61-55 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We truly believe we have a better game in us,'' Calhoun said.
``We played well together defensively, but I wasn't happy about our
offense (26 of 55 shooting). I'm happy to be here. I'm tremendously
happy to be going to Monday night's game. But I think we have a
better basketball game in us and I hope that we have that on Monday
night.''

BLUE DEVILS MOVE ON 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Finesse didn't work, not that Michigan
State was much for that anyway. Speed didn't work either. Duke had
too much of that going into the game.
</P>
<P>
   So Michigan State tried something that any Big Ten Conference
fan would appreciate. It went into its football mode. If coach Tom
Izzo's Spartans couldn't beat the Blue Devils in a conventional
way, maybe beating the Devil out of them would succeed.
</P>
<P>
   For a few minutes in the second half it almost did, but in the
end Duke turned into, well, Duke, a team that has now won 37 of 38
games, has not lost since a last-second loss to Cincinnati the day
after Thanksgiving, and is one victory away from entering the NCAA
record books as one of the greatest teams of all-time.
</P>
<P>
   All of this was played out at Tropicana Field Saturday &UR;  &LR; night in
front of a sellout crowd of 41,340 as Duke fought off an aggressive
Michigan State team, hanging on for a 68-62 victory and a spot in
Monday night's national championship game against UConn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're obviously ecstatic about winning,'' said Duke coach Mike
Krzyzewski. ``The type of game and the type of team we played
against makes it even more worthwhile. I mean it really was as
fulfulling a win that we had all year because they're so good.
Points were so hard to come by.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first 20 minutes, Duke seemed to have things under
control. Led by center and Player of the Year Elton Brand, the
Devils forged a 32-20 lead. Brand, who had 18 points and 15
rebounds (including 13 boards in the first half), simply muscled
his way underneath, calling for the ball after he cleared out any
Michigan State defenders foolish enough to try and get in his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I could score most of the time and get fouled, find an
open man,''said Brand. ``I was really demanding the ball a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   For a school with the rich football tradition of Michigan State,
that was just not acceptable. Izzo, a big football fan himself,
gave his players some simple advice: If you want to win this game,
you needed to show some of the aggressiveness that Brand was
showing.
</P>
<P>
   If Duke has a weakness _ which no one outside of Cincinnati has
really come close to finding _ it might be this. They don't know
how to play football on a basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   So for 10 glorious minutes in the second half, bodies started to
fly as the Spartans went through drills that their football
counterparts would have appreciated in spring practice, which is
currently underway back in East Lansing.
</P>
<P>
   Brand, trying to keep in the spirit of the evening, shoved back,
but he also picked up his third and fourth foul of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, it was 51-48 with 9:32 left and some Dukies in the
building with a sense of history surely remembered the last time
Blue Devils played a game in this building: last year's South
Regional final against Kentucky, in which the Devils had a 17-point
lead near the nine-minute mark and found a way to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Not this time. At least not against Michigan State. The Devils
already knew they could beat the Spartans, having taken a 17-2 lead
in the first five minutes of a Great Eight meeting in Chicago in
December and coasted to a 73-67 victory.
</P>
<P>
   This time there was no coasting. Michigan State (33-5) came out
of the locker room in the second half with an attitude and a plan.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly half of a half, it all seemed to work. Michigan
State's All-American point guard Mateen Cleaves put in a couple of
3-point shots, super-sub Morris Peterson (15 points, 8 rebounds)
got some buckets, and the Spartans were back in contention.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively speaking, of course. With Brand sitting for a spell,
the Blue Devils went to their next set of weapons, which this time
happened to be guard William Avery (14 points) and Chris Carrawell
(13). And, of course, Trajan Langdon, who made a 21-foot, 3-point
bomb from the left side that doubled the Dukies' lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Elton out of the game, we knew we had to step it up as a
team,'' said Langdon.
</P>
<P>
   For that, Michigan State had no response. Or not enough of one
to create even a hint of uncertainty. The Spartans' strategy turned
into fouling and hoping for Duke misses, which was a reasonable
assumption since the Devils made only 14 of 27 free throws. But in
the final two minutes, the Devils made just enough to keep the
Spartans at bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got it done for 40 minutes,'' said Izzo. ``We only got it
done for 25 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   For Duke, 40 more minutes of getting it done will mean a
national championship and a dream end to a dream season.

BUCKEYES NO MATCH FOR HUSKIES 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-BOS-2   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ OK, so this had nothing to do with any
confounding losing streak Boston Coll . . . er, Ohio State
basketball coach Jim O'Brien had in his previous 18 head-to-head
matchups against Jim Calhoun and his Connecticut Huskies. UConn's
decisive 64-58 victory over the Eag . . . er, Buckeyes in the first
game of Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's national semifinal doubleheader before
41,340 at Tropicana Field had little to do with O'Brien's ancient
history against his former Big East rival.
</P>
<P>
   It's more to do with the fact that Calhoun's team, once again,
proved to be the better of the two on the court. It had more to do
with the defensive straitjacket Ricky Moore threw on BC's . . . er,
Ohio State's Scoonie Penn, limiting the Buckeye catalyst to 11
points on 3-for-13 shooting. It had more to do with the effort of
Richard Hamilton, who eclipsed the 2,000-point mark for his career
with a game-high 24 points on 10-for-17 shooting, as well as an
Ohio State team that missed 40 more shots than it made (23) and
committed 11 turnovers that led to 21 easy transition points for
the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, no matter how much had changed for O'Brien, and the
members of his staff he imported from Chestnut Hill to Columbus,
since the last time he coached against UConn, one thing remained

CLEMMENSEN WON'T YIELD TO NORTHERN MICH. 
</HEADLINE>
 COLLEGE-NORTHERN MICHIGAN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Wis. _ Northern Michigan coach Rick Comley worried
about Boston College's fast starts. He worried about the Eagles'
big guns on offense.
</P>
<P>
   He worried less about goalie Scott Clemmensen.
</P>
<P>
   Oops.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the BC guns _ Jeff Farkas and Brian Gionta, got second
period power-play goals and because of Clemmensen and a tight
defense overall, that's all the Eagles needed.
</P>
<P>
   BC shut down Northern Michigan, 2-1, in a first-round NCAA West
Regional game Saturday &UR;  &LR; night to lift its record to 26-11-4. And
more importantly, the Eagles earned a spot opposite top-seeded
North Dakota in Sunday's final with a berth in the Final Four in
Anaheim _ and a matchup with Maine _ at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Clemmensen gave up a goal to Fred Mattersdorfer 5:38 into the
game. And that was it. He finished with 26 saves and finished off
the Wildcats' season at 22-15-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played better than I thought he'd play, in all honesty,''
Comley said. ``I thought their strength was up front. On tape, when
New Hampshire came back on them last week in the Hockey East
championship game I thought he was vulnerable. At times maybe he
didn't look great stopping it, but he kept it out of the net.
That's all he has to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He kept it out of the net after the Mattersdorfer goal while
Northern took the play to the Eagles in the first period. Caught a
break when Brad Frattaroli clanged one off the crossbar midway
through the period. He kept it out to keep the Wildcats off the
board through six power plays while BC was scoring twice on its own
six chances. And kept it out down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   He kept it out well enough that BC coach Jerry York and forward
Blake Bellefeuille, who set up both BC goals, called it his best
game of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was quick and he played his angles well,'' said York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clem played great tonight,'' Bellefeuille said.
</P>
<P>
   Clemmensen mostly left it for others to assess.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed they were throwing it to the net and everyone kind
of crashed down,'' Clemmensen said. ``The second period we were
kind of running around and they really came at the net pretty hard.
I think it was one of my better games this year. I've been feeling
real good. Hopefully tomorrow night I have an even better game.''
</P>
<P>
   He may need one.
</P>
<P>
   York has watched North Dakota on tape and planned to see a
little more Saturday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're as good as advertised,'' he said. ``They're extremely
quick. It will be a completely different type of game. Northern
Michigan is more defensive. North Dakota wants to get to seven real
quick.''
</P>
<P>
   North Dakota, the 1997 national champion, is 32-5-2. The
Fighting Sioux lost to Denver, 3-1, in the WCHA finals last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   After spotting Northern Michigan the first-period lead, BC came
back in the second.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles had done little with their first two power plays.
They scored 16 seconds into their third.
</P>
<P>
   Farkas took a pass from Bellefeuille and went to the net. He was
stopped by Wildcat goalie Dan Ragusett once and then put in his own
rebound for 1-1 at 5:01.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the period, Northern Michigan was already shorthanded
when Tyler Barbanoff was sent off for cross-checking.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats killed off 25 seconds of a BC five-on-three. But BC
still had a man advantage when Bellefeuille fired the puck from the
side boards and Gionta deflected it past Ragusett.
</P>
<P>
   BC had its work cut out protecting the lead in the third period.
The Eagles had to kill two penalties in the first half of the
period.
</P>
<P>
   Clemmensen made a series of tough saves, including one glove
save on Barabanoff. In the last minute, Clemmensen held his ground
when J.P. Vigier came from behind the net and tried to tuck the
puck in.
</P>
<P>
   Clemmensen, a sophomore, backboned BC's run to the national
championship game last year. This year, he started all but one of
the Eagle games and is now 25-11-4.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, he and the Eagles put the team's seven-game win
streak on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really pleased,'' York said. ``We have a team that can
score a lot of goals. We're very talented and quick. But we
stressed right from the start of the year that to be successful on
a national level we've got to be able to play these low-scoring
games.''
</P>
<P>
   For a night, at least, they did. Much to Comley's dismay.

MAINE OVERPOWERS CLARKSON

<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ The University of Maine hockey team is on the
Avenue to Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Bears earned a spot in next week's Frozen Four by
dispatching ECAC regular-season and postseason champion Clarkson,
7-2, at the Centrum Saturday &UR;  &LR; night in the second round of the NCAA
East Regional before a record crowd of 12,517.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the attack was Hobey Baker finalist Steve
Kariya, who was Bunker Hill Monument tall as he registered three
goals and three assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There something in me that says I'm not satisfied,'' said
Kariya. ``There's something bigger left. Certainly it's gratifying
and we're excited to go to the Final Four.''
</P>
<P>
   Maine is back in the big time under coach Shawn Walsh, who said
all week, ``We came here not just to win a game. We came here to
win a trip to California.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And we did it,'' Walsh said Saturday &UR;  &LR; night. ``Credit the
players. They wanted this so bad they could taste it and now
they'll go to the next level. A level they richly deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh had been indicating that his team was on the verge of
peaking and was he ever right.
</P>
<P>
   His Black Bears (29-6-4) were 2-3 in the last five games before
coming here. There were two losses at New Hampshire; two wins over
UMass-Amherst in the Hockey East playoffs, and a 3-2 overtime loss
to Boston College in the Hockey East championship game.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Bears were impressive Friday night in a 4-2 victory
over Ohio State and continued to look great in all facets of their
game Saturday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been playing well all along,'' said Walsh. ``There
never was any reason to panic. Poise is necessary for success at
this stage of the season and we have showed poise.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I almost second-guessed myself. I wanted to peak at this
tournament so we paid a price against New Hampshire and Boston
College. We changed our power play, which basically was to put Cory
Larose on the point, and that worked. Our power play picked an
appropriate time to get warm.''
</P>
<P>
   Maine was 3 of 5 with an extra man and Clarkson was 0 for 5.
</P>
<P>
   Said Larose, ``We've been focusing a lot on team speed. That's
been our game plan all week.''
</P>
<P>
   Kariya was fantastic. He's an athlete who could dance in a phone
booth like Gene Kelly while wearing his skates. He's an MVP's MVP.
</P>
<P>
   Said Walsh, ``That was an unbelievable performance by an
unbelievable player.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again team defense and firepower were keys to the Maine
victory starting with junior goalie Alfie Michaud who made 20
saves. Kariya's center Larose had 3 points and defenseman David
Cullen had 3 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal as seniors was to get Maine to be one of the
powerhouses in the country,'' said Cullen.
</P>
<P>
   Maine started the scoring at 9:32 of the first when Marcus
Gustafsson scored from point-blank range after he was set up by
Kariya and Cullen.
</P>
<P>
   Clarkson tied it at 11:05 when David Evans took a pass from
behind the Maine cage from Erik Cole and scored his fifth goal into
the right side of the net.
</P>
<P>
   Clarkson's Aaron Gates was caught hooking at 14:55. Costly.
Maine went up, 2-1, at 16:23 on the power play when Kariya scored
his 25th goal.
</P>
<P>
   A Maine goal by Cullen at 18:14 was replayed by officials and
was allowed because it went into the net after glancing off the
skate of a Clarkson defender.
</P>
<P>
   Another Clarkson penalty was costly as the Black Bears scored
their second power play at 4:55 of the second period when Kariya
potted his 26th goal.
</P>
<P>
   Clarkson was awarded a penalty shot and Evans made it 4-2 at
16:52 when he potted a 10-footer after a neat deke.
</P>
<P>
   Maine made it 5-2 at 0:37 of the third period when Larose scored
on an 18-foot backhander. Maine scored its third power-play goal
when Niko Dimitrakos of Somerville scored from 20 feet out at
12:21. Clarkson pulled goalie Shawn Grant and moments later Kariya
scored his third goal at 15:25.

<P>
   Walsh praised his assistants, saying, ``Gene Riley and Nate
Leaman convinced me to go with the high breakout to get it out of
the zone and they convinced me to shadow Erik Cole, who is as good
a player as any player we've seen all year.''
</P>
<P>
   To his seniors Walsh said, ``Good things happen to good people.
These are good people. No matter how we played tonight they'll be
successful. And all five will graduate on time.''

UNH ELIMINATES MICHIGAN

 HAMPSHIRE-MICHIGAN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ University of New Hampshire freshman winger
Darren Haydar, frustrated on at least three occasions in the early
going by Michigan goalie Josh Blackburn, saved his best for last in
the NCAA East Regional Saturday &UR;  &LR; night at the Centrum.
</P>
<P>
   Haydar was in the right place 3:16 into the first overtime,
taking a feed from behind the net from center Jason Krog and
beating Blackburn to the short side, giving top-seed UNH a 2-1
victory over the defending national champs before a record crowd of
12,517 and a trip to the Frozen Four in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   It was deja vu for the Wildcats, who defeated Boston University
in overtime a year ago in Albany to advance to the semifinals at
the FleetCenter, where they were dispatched handily by Michigan,
4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan's reign ended when Krog swept behind the Michigan net,
stripped the puck from defenseman Dave Huntziger, and found Haydar
alone at the post where he had Blackburn (22 saves) at his mercy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Krog behind the net and strip the D,'' said Haydar.
(Mike) Souza was yelling for the puck in the center and (Krog)
threw it into the middle. I cut in, and it hit Blackburn in the
pads and went in.''
</P>
<P>
   UNH outskated Michigan for long stretches and outshot the
Wolverines, 34-21. The Central Collegiate Hockey Association
champions (25-11-6) not only saw their their six-game winning
streak snapped, but also their quest to become the first team in 27
years to win back-to-back national titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pressured the puck all night and didn't give up many
opportunities,'' said UNH coach Dick Umile, whose team improved its
record to 30-6-3, including a 9-1-2 streak over its last 12 games.
``I'm looking forward to going out west. This is a special group
and this is a team with a legitimate chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   With its come-from-behind, 5-3 victory over Denver here on
Friday, Michigan boosted its NCAA Tournament winning streak to five
games. The sixth wasn't to be, but Michigan made it interesting,
tying the game with 10 minutes to play on a Bobby Hayes wrister
that broke between the pads of UNH goalie Ty Conklin.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes had won the faceoff from Krog, something that the center
had on his mind as overtime loomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely felt like I owed the team,'' said Krog. ``I felt
like the season was on the line. I wanted to leave everything on
the ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Souza, from Wakefield, gave UNH the early lead, finishing off a
two-on-one with Haydar with just 9.2 seconds remaining in the
opening period. Blackburn kept the game close after that, but
Michigan coach Red Berenson had a feeling that Friday's tough game
with Denver was working to UNH's advantage since the Wildcats were
rested and waiting with a bye in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night's game took its toll,'' said Berenson, ``and it
showed early and as the game wore on. Tonight, I don't think we had
enough left over.''
</P>
<P>
   UNH held an 8-1 shot advantage at the halfway point of the
opening period. Shot No. 8 was Haydar's foiled breakaway attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Haydar's frustration mounted with 7:41 to go in the period when
he was alone at the crease for a one-timer that was again foiled by
Blackburn.
</P>
<P>
   But UNH persevered, got the late first period strike, then kept
pouring it on, except for a stretch late in the second period when
Michigan mounted its only sustained pressure of the game.
</P>
<P>
   UNH, after killing off an early penalty, was in control for most
of the second period. Haydar made a nice move, but his wraparound
shot went through the crease. UNH's Jason Shipulski then tested
Blackburn with a 25-footer that the goalie tipped over the crossbar
with his glove. Midway through the period, Blackburn was quick to
deflect Matt Dzieduszycki's wrister.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan put some late pressure on Conklin with its best chance,
a Dale Rominski second rebound attempt that resulted in a pile of
bodies at the crease, but no goal.
</P>
<P>
   UNH, which was outshot in the second, 11-8, took its one-goal
lead into the final period, then lost it, then won in dramatic and
familiar fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sweet last year in Albany,'' said Krog, ``but this is
the present. It feels awesome.''

HARVARD WOMEN SHOW FINAL FLOURISH 
</HEADLINE>
 HAMPSHIRE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Exactly 10 years ago, in these same Twin Cities,
the Harvard men's hockey team won its first NCAA title in an
overtime thriller. Happy anniversary gentlemen, and move over while
you're at it: the Harvard women made more history when they won
their first national championship Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, 6-5, against the
University of New Hampshire in _ that's right _ an overtime
thriller.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard (33-1) extended its winning streak to 30 games by
defeating the defending national champions in the second annual
American Women's College Hockey Alliance Division 1 National
Championship, before 2,507 in Mariucci Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing could be better,'' said an elated A.J. Mleczko, the
senior captain who had left school for two years to train for the
gold medal-winning 1998 US Olympic team. ``When I decided to come
back, I never dreamed we'd have a season like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner came 8:01 into the extra period when Jen Botterill
took a pass from Mleczko to score her 37th goal of the year. It was
Botterill's eighth point of the tournament, and she was named its
Most Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   Mleczko's overtime assist was her first point of the game,
leaving her 2 shy of the NCAA mark of 116 set by Tony Hrkac for the
University of North Dakota in 1986-87.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I made it a point that counted,'' beamed Mleczko as
her teammates celebrated behind her on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   The win came in front of backup goaltender Alison Kuusisto, who
was needed after a collision in Friday's semifinal win over Brown
left starter Crystal Springer with a broken collarbone, the same
one she injured in January that kept her out of action for six
weeks. In that span, the freshman Kuusisto went 9-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew not having (Springer) wasn't going to make a big
difference,'' said UNH coach Karen Kay, whose own netminder, Alicia
Roberts, kept the Wildcats in the game by saving 48 of 54 shots.
</P>
<P>
   With UNH silencing Harvard's deadly first line for much of the
game, sophomore center Angie Francisco _ like Kuusisto, a Duluth,
Minn., native with supporters in the crowd _ also came up huge.
Francisco's hat trick included two goals midway through the third
period that gave Harvard a 5-3 lead with less than seven minutes
left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had this game won at six minutes, and we let them crawl
back in because we were a little bit lazy, looking for a little
more offense before taking care of our own end,'' said Harvard
coach Katey Stone.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard held the lead for just 90 seconds before UNH junior
center Carisa Zaban punched one in from the top of the crease at
14:41 to cut the gap to 5-4, followed at 17:22 by a turnaround
no-looker from junior right wing Samantha Holmes off a rebound to
even it at 5-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone thought we were done when it was 5-3,'' said
Kay.
</P>
<P>
   Not anyone who saw last week's ECAC final, in which UNH also
came back from a two-goal deficit to take the Crimson into
overtime, only to lose 5-4. Saturday night was UNH's fourth loss of
the season to Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the third period we went into the locker room and
regrouped,'' said Botterill of her team's shakier-than-usual play
for much of the game. ``We went out on a mission.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just knew what we had to do,'' agreed Francisco. ``We were
calm.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Crimson pandemonium that broke out after Botterill's
overtime score.

   KOSOVO-CLINTON _ WASHINGTON _ When news came of an F-117A
Nighthawk going down over Yugoslavia last night, with Serb
television showing the burning wreckage, it was a worst-case
scenario for the Clinton Administration. Because despite all the
warnings beforehand that NATO pilots could be lost, nothing would
bring it home to the American people like the real thing. We expect
Clinton political opponents to hammer him on this theme Sunday. How
will the administration handle it? (Shepard, Cox Washington Bureau)

   KOSOVO-AID _ SKOPJE, Macedonia _ When humanitarian aid groups
pulled out of Kosovo last Wednesday, they distributed enough food
and water to support the distressed people there _ which then
numbered more than 500,000 _ for about a week. That means these
folks will run out of food by midweek. The situation may actually
be worse because the distribution centers where they left the food
are probably being overwhelmed by freshly displaced people. There
are talks of humanitarian air lifts to drop food but no one
believes that's a reasonable solution. Meanwhile, sources in the
provincial capital of Pristina report and confirm the chaos there.

   HEMP-FARMERS (Bismarck, N.D.) _ Like so many American farmers
who are getting poor prices for traditional crops, Dennis Carlson,
who grows wheat in Bismarck, N.D., is scratching for alternatives.
In North Dakota that includes hemp, a plant harvested in other
countries for its fibers, seeds and oil that is banned in the
United States because it is a genetic relative of marijuana. But
American farmers, in struggling to survive, are colliding with the
war on drugs. The prohibition of hemp, whose psychoactive kick is

   HOSPITALS-RESIDENTS (New York) _ Two years ago, dozens of

program to ease the nationwide glut of physicians. The federal
government would pay bonuses to the hospitals if they trained fewer
doctors, just as it once paid corn farmers not to grow corn. But
half those hospitals have now dropped out of the plan, after

wrong, and for two years, researchers at the U.S. Holocaust
Memorial Museum have been trying to flesh out the stories of the
survivors. Now, as the 60th anniversary of the voyage approaches

   MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST (Undated) _ As both sides forge proposals
for talks in hopes of settling the Microsoft antitrust case,

attorneys general know just what their bottom line is _ liberation
from what they perceive as a form of feudalism in which they play
the serfs. By Steve Lohr.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE-CHARITY (Undated) _ Special Report: As Americans become
increasingly comfortable shopping online, it is a pitch few can
resist: Buy an Elmo toy or a Stephen King novel through our Web
sites and part of the purchase price will go to the charity of your
choice. But once you buy Elmo online, it is impossible to know if
the few dollars you thought were speeding their way to a good cause
will ever end up in the charity's hands. By Reed Abelson. With art.

   PHILOSOPHY-PRISON _ During an unusual course in philosophy and
literature that Earl Shorris was teaching specifically for the poor
and homeless, a student who had a history of violent behavior
telephoned Shorris. The student had become so angry at a colleague,
he reported, that he wanted ``to smack her up against the wall.''
Shorris feared the worst. Was this a call from jail? No, because
instead of striking outward, the student had reflected inward and
asked himself, ``What would Socrates do?'' The Connections column.

`THE CENTURY': DON'T EXPECT TO SEE EVERYTHING
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not as if the year 2000 comes with Big Ideas already
attached; it's a number, not a philosophy. No wonder we're facing a
glut of retrospectives that seem driven as much by public relations
as public sentiment: millennial fever as a commercial ploy or a
knee-jerk response to some imagined obligation.
</P>
<P>
   So the Whitney Museum of American Art presents an exhibition
(coming next month) called ``The American Century: Art and
Culture,'' not to be confused with Harold Evans' best-selling book
called, simply, ``The American Century,'' in a pattern bound to go
on well into 2001. It's as if publishers and producers everywhere
were thinking, ``It's the end of the century, got to do
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Does all this backward gazing satisfy a genuine longing for
closure? Or do the retrospectives feed an imagined appetite, with
the whole country gazing at the emperor's new clothes and
pretending to see the meaning of the last hundred years?
</P>
<P>
   One hint at the obligatory impulse behind it all is evident in
the way even a real issue, like the Y2K bug, is surrounded by
hollow apocalyptic warnings. Another clue comes with ABC News'
hugely ambitious, sometimes glorious and often disappointingly
pedestrian series, ``The Century.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the series creates a landmark of its own, its safe,
made-by-committee feel means that viewers should approach this epic
with diminished expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Those expectations are justifiably high because the series' very
existence is iconoclastic and daring. For a network to devote 12
hours of prime time to a documentary from the news division is
unheard of today. The series' scope and resources promise something
brash and inventive, something that reinvents the form or at least
brings it new energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Century'' has great intelligence behind it, but less
originality. If you stumbled across it while flipping channels, you
might think, except for the reassuring presence of Peter Jennings
as host and narrator, that it was one more PBS documentary, with
its historical film and too many talking heads from academia.
</P>
<P>
   The series is spread over six nonconsecutive nights, each with
two separate but linked stories. The episode on World War I is
paired with one on the war in Vietnam, both suggesting the
consequences of trying to reshape other people's countries.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Memphis provides a slighter connection between an
episode on the rise of Elvis Presley, with all he meant for pop
culture, and the sanitation workers' strike in 1968 that drew
Martin Luther King Jr. to the city where he was killed.
</P>
<P>
   This shrewdly selective focus is one way in which the series
differs from the best-selling companion book by Jennings and Todd
Brewster. (The History Channel's 15{-hour sister series, which
begins on April 12, is more plodding than ABC's. Superficially, it
resembles the book more in its chronological approach and reliance
on eyewitness testimony from ordinary people.)
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on storytelling makes each episode of the ABC
series a mini-drama. But hour by hour, the quality veers from
absorbing and illuminating to eye-glazingly familiar.
</P>
<P>
   The best and worst are on view Monday night, in a triumphant
episode on Charles Lindbergh's solo flight across the Atlantic in
1927 and a tired one about the NASA flights to the moon and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Though Lindbergh's career may seem familiar, most people know
the barest outline. ``The Century'' creates a euphoric sense of
immediacy, of living in the moment when Lindbergh's success was
still an open question. (The full saga has been told with a fresh
vision in the recent biography by A. Scott Berg, who appears as one
of Monday night's more articulate commentators.)
</P>
<P>
   The storytelling here offers a swift, rich sense of context,
including the fact that Lindbergh's heroic flight was spurred by a
contest promising $25,000 to the first team to fly between New York
and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Before Lindbergh, six men had died trying to make that flight.
The series' wealth of rare images includes film of one of those
earlier planes crashing and bursting into flames. Such images are
the most powerful elements in the series, which itself is strong
evidence that this is the century of pictures, both still and
moving.
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh is seen first as a meek young man from St. Louis,
overwhelmed by the raucous crowds of New York City. His plane was
called the Spirit of St. Louis at the suggestion of the hometown
businessmen who had backed him financially. ``They were, after all,
interested in publicity,'' Jennings says, in one of astute comments
dropped in. By not leaning too hard on such observations, the
narrative maintains its buoyant energy.

 UNDATED: buoyant energy.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But ``The Century'' takes a sudden nose dive in Monday night's
second hour, which begins with President John F. Kennedy's promise
to send an American to the moon. It features familiar NASA stories,
with equally familiar pictures and talking heads. If there is a way
to make this tale seem newly told, the series has not found it.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday brings a gripping episode, ``The Great War.'' Its film
may be the most astonishing and its historical perspective the most
trenchant in the entire series. (The last two installments were not
available in advance.) It begins on Christmas Eve 1914 with the
cease-fire between British and German soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, the old black-and-white film makes the past live
vividly on screen. When Jennings says, ``In 1914 war was seen as an
exhilarating experience,'' the remark is backed up by scenes of
troops heading onto ships, and by interviews with survivors. The
reality of war is then depicted with horrifying clarity, in film of
German soldiers teeming out of foxholes after inadequate English
shellings, and of a man whose nose had been blown off being fitted
with a masklike contraption to give him a false one.
</P>
<P>
   And here the historical analysis of the disastrous World War I
peace plan touches the present. As the victors carved up and
reconfigured the area that now includes Bosnia and Kosovo, they
disregarded the ethnic grudges that, as one historian puts it,
``would haunt the rest of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing the series' uneven course, the episode on Vietnam is
pedantic for too long before its drama emerges. In recent
interviews with people who were there and in startling film, it
presents Americans and South Vietnamese crowding on Marine
helicopters to evacuate Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   But even dramatic pictures aren't enough to save the ``two
cautionary tales,'' as Jennings calls them, about the rise of
Hitler and the making of the atomic bomb. Scenes of scientists
constructing a test bomb are amazing to watch.
</P>
<P>
   But these episodes offer abrupt, startling visions embedded in
stories that never catch fire. Similarly, your reaction to the
Elvis episode may depend on whether you've ever seen the film of
his early television appearances; they immediately reveal what a
break he was with the past, but they have been shown often before.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most obligatory retrospectives can emerge with popular
appeal, of course. ``The Century'' book remains on the best-seller
list months after clever marketing helped make it one of the
Christmas season's hottest presents. Feeding the last hundred years
back to us in easy bite-size morsels, ``The Century'' on television
may have been reaching for the widest possible audience. Given the
series' high ambitions, it's hard not to see the results as a lost
opportunity.

THE MYTH MAKERS: Sportswriters in the '20s helped turn athletes
into legends (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Andy Friedlander 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On one Saturday afternoon in 1924, Illinois halfback Red Grange
and the All-America backfield of Notre Dame made history.
</P>
<P>
   But it took Grantland Rice to make them part of history.
</P>
<P>
   The record books have noted that on Oct. 18, 1924, Notre Dame's
backfield of Harry Stuhldreher, Don Miller, ``Sleepy Jim'' Crowley
and Elmer Layden slashed through Army's rugged defense on the way
to a 13-7 victory in a battle of unbeatens. And that on the same
day, Grange scored five touchdowns and threw for another as the
Illini shocked No. 1 Michigan, 39-14.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Rice, the most respected sports journalist of his
time, who turned those exploits _ and the men who performed them _
into legends.
</P>
<P>
   Rice was not the only writer who sought to create characters of
mythic proportion. It was standard practice in the 1920s to build
up athletes with dramatic and often flowery prose (sometimes with a
bit of poetry mixed in), while ignoring their foibles.
</P>
<P>
   The stories rarely contained quotes from the participants.
Writers felt they were much more qualified to explain what happened
than the players or the coaches and laced their stories with grand
metaphors that made even routine games seem like epic battles.
</P>
<P>
   Never was that better illustrated than in October 1924. The
morning after Notre Dame outlasted Army at the Polo Grounds,
readers of the ``New York Herald Tribune'' and the more than 100
newspapers nationwide that carried Rice's column picked up their
sports pages and read the most famous and widely quoted lead in the
history of sportswriting:
</P>
<P>
   ``Outlined against a blue-gray October sky, the Four Horsemen
rode again. In dramatic lore they are known as Famine, Pestilence,
Destruction and Death. These are only aliases. Their real names are
Stuhldreher, Miller, Crowley and Layden. They formed the crest of
the South Bend cyclone before which another fighting Army football
team was swept over the precipice at the Polo Grounds yesterday as
55,000 spectators peered down on the bewildering panorama spread on
the green plain below.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon reading those lines, a Notre Dame publicity man came up
with the idea of a photo with the players on horseback. They would
forever be known as The Four Horsemen.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after, Rice turned his attention to Grange, the toast
of the football world for his elusive running style. Rice likened
him to a specter, fading out of sight at the last moment and
leaving defenders grabbing at air. To emphasize the analogy, Rice,
who had several volumes of his poetry published, broke into verse:
``''A streak of fire, a breath of flame
</P>
<P>
   Eluding all who reach and clutch
</P>
<P>
   A gray ghost thrown into the game
</P>
<P>
   That rival hands may never touch'' ''
</P>
<P>
   And the Galloping Ghost was born.
</P>
<P>
   Rice's ability to make a sporting event seem bigger than life
fit perfectly with the 1920s, a decade Rice dubbed The Golden Age
of Sports _ yet another label that endures. The '20s were all about
excess, be it Babe Ruth's prodigious home runs or Bobby Jones' 13
major golf championships in eight years or the 14 seconds it took
the referee to count to nine in the Jack Dempsey-Gene Tunney
rematch. And the sporting press of the day fed that monster,
because that's what the public wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The writers were more than happy to deliver, and in so doing
became celebrities themselves. Some had a head start _ famed
Western gunfighter Bat Masterson was already nationally known
before he began writing a sports column for the ``New York Morning
Telegraph'' (he died at his typewriter in 1921) _ but most, like
Rice, made their names with their words.
</P>
<P>
   The best of them gathered at nearly every big event, such as the
World Series or a heavyweight title fight or a big college football
game. Among them were Damon Runyon, called ``the best reporter in
the world'' by his boss, ``New York American'' publisher William
Randolph Hearst; Heywood Broun of the ``New York World'', who also
made a name for himself as a war correspondent and a union
crusader; young ``Daily News'' sports editor Paul Gallico, whose
first-person account of a sparring session with Dempsey put him on
the map and who would later become the bestselling author of ``The
Snow Goose'' and ``The Poseidon Adventure''; and Ring Lardner of
the ``Chicago Tribune'' and the Bell syndicate, whose cynicism set
him apart in an era of hero-building.
</P>
<P>
   Later, that group would be joined by Shirley Povich, who in 1926
was named sports editor of the then-struggling ``Washington Post''
at age 21 and became an institution almost immediately. And at the
major golf events, they could be sure to run into O.B. Keeler of
the ``Atlanta Journal'', who faithfully chronicled the astounding
achievements of Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Together, these men helped make heroes out of athletes. Some,
like Ruth, whom Gallico called ``a swashbuckler built on gigantic
and heroic lines,'' needed little help in that regard, but got it
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Lardner was the exception. He delighted in tearing down the
pompous, and his skepticism served him well in 1919, when he and
Hugh Fullerton of the ``Chicago Examiner'' were credited with being
the first to realize the White Sox had thrown the World Series.

BASEBALL IN BLACK AND WHITE: JAKE ATZ AND THE CATS 
WITH CENTURY OF SPORTS PACKAGE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Manager Jake Atz and the Fort Worth Panthers boarded a train in
Little Rock, Ark., after winning the first Dixie Series in 1920.
They went to sleep expecting to awake the next morning as the train
pulled into the Fort Worth depot.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they were on the outskirts of Little Rock when they
woke up.
</P>
<P>
   The train's engine trouble delayed the Panthers' arrival home by
12 hours, but it didn't dim the excitement of the fans. Atz and his
players were loaded into cars that evening for a parade up Main
Street to the Metropolitan Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``No Roman warrior could have rightfully claimed greater
recognition than was accorded the Panthers,'' wrote
``Star-Telegram'' columnist Billy Bee. ``They rode in automobiles
instead of chariots. Small boys excitedly followed them and
thousands of grownups lined the sidewalks.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Babe Ruth's exploits were helping make baseball
the national pastime, the Panthers were on their way to capturing
the hearts of Fort Worth sports fans by winning six consecutive
Texas League pennants and five Dixie Series titles, the greatest
dynasty in league history.
</P>
<P>
   They were an easy team to like. What the players didn't have in
talent, they made up for with a competitive fire that reflected
their manager, who overcame a lack of speed and power to play parts
of four major-league seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Born John Jacob Zimmerman, Atz legally changed his name in 1900
after he was last in a minor-league club's payline and watched the
money run out. He might have lasted longer in the big leagues if a
fastball from Hall of Famer Walter Johnson had not slammed into his
hip in 1913 and left him with a permanent limp.
</P>
<P>
   Atz came to Fort Worth in 1914 as a player-manager for the
Panthers. In 1918, the team was purchased by a group headed by
local businessman W.K. Stripling and former minor-league third
baseman Paul LaGrave, who made Atz the full-time skipper.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, LaGrave had assembled a talented group of
players, giving Atz the tools he needed to put the Panthers on a
winning track.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to talent, fans were attracted to the Panthers
because the majority of the players stayed with the team throughout
its championship run, said Bobby Bragan, a Panthers player and
manager in the '40s and '50s and a baseball historian.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't the change you see today,'' Bragan said. ``They
might sell one or two players to the major leagues each year, but
fans were able to become familiar with the players.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the Panthers were a team as entertaining off the field as
it was on. Atz once said his team ``could drink any brewery dry at
night and beat any baseball team the next afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Atz's Cats were the toast of the town. The team was alternately
referred to as the Cats, the story goes, because newspaper headline
writers could fit ``Cats'' instead of ``Panthers'' more easily into
large type.
</P>
<P>
   After the Panthers clinched the 1920 Texas League pennant by
defeating Wichita Falls, a night of celebration ensued. According
to the ``Star-Telegram'', fans rousted first baseman Clarence ``Big
Boy'' Kraft from bed and took him downtown, where, during the
course of the celebration, he was stripped of his clothes, ``except
for his unmentionables'' and made to walk back through the main
streets of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't holler,'' Atz advised afterward. ``Suppose they hadn't
left you that.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Panthers wrapped up the 1920 pennant in the Class B
Texas League, the fans were given an additional reason to
celebrate. LaGrave convinced the Class A Southern Association
champion Arkansas Travelers to play the Panthers in a best-of-seven
series, which came to be known as the Dixie Series.
</P>
<P>
   A near-riot broke out as fans packed Worth Cigar Store in a rush
to purchase tickets, which cost $1 for bleacher seats, $1.50 for
grandstand general admission and $2 for reserve seats. Scalpers
were said to be getting $5 a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The seven games of the first Dixie Series drew 36,835 fans and
generated $50,000 in ticket sales, assuring the future of the
series.
</P>
<P>
   During the six years of the Panthers' pennant-winning streak,
they continued to draw huge crowds at Panther Park, west of North
Main between North Sixth Street and North Seventh Street. Sellouts
of up to 8,000 for regular-season games were common. Playoff games
attracted up to 10,000 fans when extra seating was added along the
foul lines.
</P>
<P>
   Large crowds weren't restricted to the ballpark, either.
Thousands of fans who didn't make the trip to distant playoff games
packed downtown streets to watch a giant scoreboard. Play-by-play
was transmitted back to Fort Worth by wire and announced to the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   In 1922, WBAP broadcast the first baseball game in the South
during a five-game series between the Panthers and Wichita Falls on
Aug. 30. The game was transmitted by telegraph from Panther Park
downtown to a studio where the broadcast was made. The response was
so overwhelming that the station sent Harold Hough to the park on
Sept. 1 for the first live broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   By 1926, the Panthers' success led to the construction of a new
Panther Park, just east of the old site, near the Trinity River.
Despite the new surroundings, the Panthers began to lose more and
more players to retirement or higher leagues. Archrival Dallas
ended the Panthers' reign.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers remained competitive for the remainder of the
decade, but it wasn't until 1930 that Fort Worth was treated to
another Texas League pennant and a trip to the Dixie Series. But by
that time, Atz was no longer managing.
</P>
<P>
   Also missing was LaGrave, who became ill in 1928 and died in
1929. Panther Park was renamed LaGrave Field in his honor.
Stripling and the LaGrave estate sold the team to Ted Robinson in
1929. Atz returned briefly to manage the team in 1933, but he was
replaced before the 1934 season. He went on to manage in the Texas
League at Dallas, Shreveport, Tulsa and Galveston, as well as in
other leagues. He died in 1945 in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The fans' enthusiasm generated by the success of Atz's Cats
continued long after the steak ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was great enthusiasm from the fans when I came here,''
said Bragan, who joined the Panthers in 1948. ``I think a lot of
that can be traced back to Jake Atz and those six championships.''

2.5 MINUTE RIDE: LAUGHTER AND HORROR IN A JOURNEY OF THE HEART
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lisa Kron is not someone you would describe as the
silent type. She is a lively, showy talker, a natural storyteller,
and she has made an art out of being just that, with comic
monologues about subjects like the horrors of high school reunions.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out, however, that Ms. Kron also knows about the holes
in life that can't be filled by descriptive sentences and about the
images that can never be captured in photographs.
</P>
<P>
   In her remarkable new performance piece, ``2.5 Minute Ride,''
which opened Sunday night at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, Ms.
Kron serves up wonderfully evocative, and often seriously funny,
strings of words. But it's the pauses around and beneath those
words, silences that are respectful to the point of awe, that set
off the emotional vibrations that won't stop.
</P>
<P>
   And though this family portrait of a monologue is accompanied by
a slide show, what's projected onto the walls behind Ms. Kron are
blank rectangles of light; that is not to say that they are empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``2.5 Minute Ride'' boldly assumes the task of looking for the
connections between two very different family outings: a recent
trip to an Ohio amusement park and Ms. Kron's visit six years ago
with her septuagenarian father to the Auschwitz concentration camp,
where her grandparents were killed. There's no way you can draw a
straight line between these excursions, and Ms. Kron doesn't try.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by the evening's end, a wondering, ineffable sense of
symmetry has emerged, a wry but reverent feeling for the patterns
shaped by time. Directed with a sure and delicate hand by Mark
Brokaw, ``2.5 Minute Ride'' puts Ms. Kron on a level with sterling
monologists like Spalding Gray, autobiographers who combine
novelistic complexity with stage-smart impudence.
</P>
<P>
   The ground she covers in her 70 minutes of fragmented but fluid
narrative is staggering. Her ambition is to create a picture, both
for herself and her audience, of her father, who was evacuated from
Nazi Germany in 1937 as part of the Kindertransport program.
</P>
<P>
   She knows that any picture she provides will be incomplete,
filtered through filial subjectivity and the incredulity that still
overtakes anyone considering the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the ``slide show'' Ms. Kron uses in her performance, in
which she alludes to visual images, even tracing photographic
details with a pointer, when all you see is the light of the
projector. (The expert lighting is by Kenneth Posner.)
</P>
<P>
   ``When I try to tell his stories, I begin to hyperventilate, and
I don't know why,'' she says at one point of her father. ``I can
feel the myth, the awe creep into my voice, and it makes me feel
sick because what does that have to do with him?''
</P>
<P>
   She does conquer those reservations to deliver her father's
first-person account of his experience as an interrogator with the
U.S. Army in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   What's extraordinary about the anecdote is its narrator's sense
of identification with the guilt of the person he is questioning.
There are many things in Ms. Kron's performance that make you fall
in love with her father, but none more so than this element of
moral self-doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The vignette comes late in ``2.5 Minute Ride,'' which though
anything but linear in its chronology is as carefully plotted as a
historian's time chart. Ms. Kron leapfrogs from droll observations
about her family's life in Lansing, Mich., where she grew up and
her parents still live, to sharp and sorrowful accounts of her trip
to Germany and Poland to a description of her brother's recent
wedding at a Jewish center in Canarsie, Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   That these shards of history coalesce into an illuminating whole
has much to do with the accumulation of seemingly incongruous
details, which come to echo off and enhance one another. The image
of Ms. Kron's father's diminishing eyesight, and of the array of
glasses he uses to correct it, acquires increasing resonance.
</P>
<P>
   So does her mother's refusing to be photographed after a certain
age, and the affection of her father, who has a heart condition,
for roller coasters that set the heart leaping and the teeth
chattering.
</P>
<P>
   The 2.5 minutes of the play's title are a reference to the
length of one of those rides. But I don't want to say much more
about the show. Much of its impact comes from the ways in which Ms.
Kron stealthily plants her seeds of disparate images in your mind
and lets them grow organically.
</P>
<P>
   I should say that those who know Ms. Kron as a hilarious
satirist, from such pieces as ``101 Humiliating Stories'' and her
work with the Five Lesbian Brothers, won't be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   She offers witty, brightly sardonic descriptions of everything
from a 24-hour superstore in Lansing to the culinary fare of Poland
to the assorted aches, illnesses and eccentricities of various
family members.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is never condescension in her humor. It is simply a
crucial part of her navigational equipment in finding her way
through life's absurd course of non sequiturs.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the show, Ms. Kron describes the emotional
about-face she undergoes at her brother's wedding. She had arrived
expecting to mock. But then, ``an unexpected thing happened,'' she
says. ``I became enchanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kron has steered us so gently and expertly to this point
that we understand her response exactly. A lot of elements feed
into that sense of enchantment, many of them sad. It is nonetheless
a soaring feeling.

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FIRSTS
</P>
<P>
   First state football championship: On Jan. 8, 1921, Cleburne and
Houston Heights battled to a 0-0 deadlock in what was the first
official state football championship staged by the Interscholastic
League, the forerunner to the University Interscholastic League.
The game was played in the rain and ankle-deep mud at Clark Field
in Austin; the field had recently been plowed for sodding. Teams
were invited to the 1920 state playoffs based on records submitted
by 198 schools to the Bureau of Football Results, and then the
playoffs ensued.
</P>
<P>
   First SWC broadcast: On Nov. 25, the Texas-Texas A&AMP;M game was
broadcast by WTAW to College Station. The legend of the
Longhorns-Aggies rivalry took hold in this game before a crowd
estimated at 20,000 in Austin. UT won, 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   First true pro basketball team: The Original Celtics, who were
paid a salary to keep the players from bouncing to different teams,
were formed in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   First woman to swim the Channel: Five men had swum the English
Channel before New Yorker Gertrude Ederle, 19, crossed the 21 miles
covered in grease to fight the cold and broke the existing male
record by more than two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Best game: On Oct. 10, 1926, in the seventh inning of the
seventh game of the World Series, Grover Cleveland Alexander of the
St. Louis Cardinals struck out the New York Yankees' Tony Lazzeri
with two outs and the bases loaded. Alexander had pitched a
complete game the day before and was said to be nursing a hangover,
thinking he would not be used. But Cardinals player-manager Rogers
Hornsby summoned Old Pete in relief, and Alexander preserved the
Cardinals' 3-2 as St. Louis won the World Series.
WHAT'S NEW
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Age of Sports made for enduring innovations and
phrases that entered America's consciousness forever, some based on
fact, others intertwined with fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Athlete's foot: The first mention was believed to have been made
in ``Literary Digest'' in 1928. Ringworm of the foot became
associated with athletes; in the 1920s, locker rooms with showers
provided an ideal condition for lurking fungi.
</P>
<P>
   Cagers: Beginning in the late 1890s, most professional
basketball games were played inside a wire cage that encircled the
court, keeping the ball in play and unruly fans away from the
action (hence the nickname ``cagers'' for basketball players). But
in 1925, the American Basketball League, in an attempt to create a
more open game, became the first pro league of the century to
eliminate the cage. By 1929, cages were all but extinct. The ABL
also banned the double dribble, which was at the time a legal and
popular technique for advancing the ball among Eastern pro players.
</P>
<P>
   Globetrotters: Abe Saperstein, a former Chicago social worker,
founded the Harlem Globetrotters in 1927. He formed the Savoy Big
Five in '26, but when the Savoy ballroom in Chicago, the team's
home, was converted into a roller skating rink, Saperstein took the
team on the road. He chose the team's name to let the public know
the players were blacked and they traveled.
</P>
<P>
   Lively Ball: Babe Ruth's quantum leap in home runs from 29 in
1919 to 54 in 1920 is often attributed to a ``lively'' ball. Yet,
there is no evidence of a dramatic change in the ball in 1920. A
bigger change: the spitball and discoloration of the ball was
banned in February 1920. Ruth's breakthrough might have come in
1919, but he was still splitting time between the outfield and
pitching, and he appeared in only 130 games.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 16, 1920, Cleveland's Ray Chapman was killed by a pitch
from Yankees right-hander Carl Mays. The tragedy accelerated
reform. Instead of using only three or four balls per game, which
led to the balls becoming misshapen and dark, new baseballs were
fed continuously into a game. The National League reported it used
27,924 baseballs in the 1920 season, an increase of more than
10,000 over 1919. And owners, happy with larger crowds which led to
greater profits, weren't about to stop the batting onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   The Long Count: Sept. 22, 1927, seventh round, Soldier Field,
Chicago. Before a crowd of 104,000 that included 10 governors,
several U.S. senators and a radio audience of 60 million,
challenger Jack Dempsey knocked champion Gene Tunney to the canvas.
Dempsey goes to his corner five feet away rather than the
``farthest neutral corner'' as mandated by Illinois rules and as
agreed upon before the fight.
</P>
<P>
   The referee moved Dempsey to the proper corner and didn't pick
up the count until the timekeeper was at 5. At the referee's count
of 4, 9 by the timekeeper, Tunney raises his eyes and looks at the
referee. Could he have gotten up? At the ref's count of 9 (14 after
the timekeeper started the count)), Tunney was up. He danced away
from Dempsey the rest of the round, then dominated the rest of the
fight to retain his crown. Tunney insisted he could have gotten up
after the referee's count of two.
</P>
<P>
   Ice princess: In the 1928 Winter Olympics, Sonja Henie was the
first figure skater to be costumed in skirts that are short instead
of ankle-length, putting fashion into sport.
</P>
<P>
   No. 3, No. 4: On Jan. 22, 1929, the Yankees announced that all
players would have numbers on their backs, thereby becoming the
first baseball team to start continuous use of numbers. The system
was based on the batting order; Babe Ruth was 3, Lou Gehrig was 4.
By 1933, all big-league players wore uniform numbers.
</P>
<P>
   One leg at a time: Francis Schmidt became football coach at TCU
in 1929, and he is said to have popularized the saying that an
opponent's players, no matter how good, ``put their pants on just
like you do, one leg at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelfth Man: On Jan. 2, 1922, Southwest Conference champion
Texas A&AMP;M played in the Dixie Classic against Centre College at
Fair Park Stadium in Dallas. E. King Gill had been on the football
team, but had switched to basketball. He was in street clothes at
the Classic and was asked to help as a spotter in the press box for
a sports writer. Near the end of the first half, Gill was called
down to the Aggies bench, and was told because of injuries he might
have to play. He and one of the injured players went under the
stands and switched outfits. Gill never played, but he stood by,
ready. This is why A&AMP;M students stand during games.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Pipp: On June 2, 1925, Yankees first baseman Wally Pipp
supposedly begged out of the lineup because he had a headache. Lou
Gehrig, who had pinch-hit the day before, took Pipp's place. Gehrig
didn't come out of the lineup until his consecutive game streak
reached 2,130. Baseball players even today deride any regular
asking out of the lineup as ``Wally Pipp.''
</P>
<P>
   Win one for The Gipper: ``Some time, Rock, when the team's up
against it, when things are wrong and the breaks are beating the
boys, tell them to go in there with all they've got and win just
one for the Gipper. ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Against Army on Nov. 28, 1928, Notre Dame coach Knute Rockne
ignited his injury-riddled team with what he said were the dying
words of George Gipp, the Irish All-American who died after
contracting strep throat late in the 1920 season. Notre Dame
defeated unbeaten and heavily favored Army, 12-6, at Yankee
Stadium. As Jack Chevigny, later head coach in the mid-1930s at the
University of Texas, scores the Irish's first touchdown, he shouts,
``That's one for the Gipper.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem, contends author Murray Sperber in ``Shake Down the
Thunder: The Creation of Notre Dame Football'': No one ever
referred to Gipp in his life as the Gipper, and Rockne had last
visited him weeks before his death. What is indisputable is that
Rockne's team played inspired football that day.
</P>
<P>
   How good was George Gipp? Superior to Jim Thorpe or Red Grange,
Rockne said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's moving time again at the Roundabout Theater Co.
(Is that why they call it the Roundabout?)
</P>
<P>
   In its 34-year history, the Off Broadway and Broadway hit
factory that has grown into the nation's second largest nonprofit
theater after Lincoln Center's has moved from a Chelsea supermarket
basement to a Chelsea movie house, to the Fashion Institute of
Technology in the garment center to the former Tammany Hall on
Union Square to the Criterion Center on Broadway and 45th Street,
where it has been since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Now with the Criterion's owner, Charles B. Moss Jr., reclaiming
the space amid a Times Square rebuilding boom, the Roundabout is
packing its bags once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be out in two weeks,'' said Todd Haimes, the
company's artistic director, as growing piles of cartons choked the
corridors. The offices for the staff of 100 will move into new
quarters at 231 West 39th Street next month, but the current plays
at the 499-seat main theater and the 399-seat Laura Pels Theater,
``The Lion in Winter'' and ``The Mineola Twins,'' will run until
May 30. The entire building must be vacated by June 10, Haimes
said, adding that a legal agreement with Moss prevented him from
saying more. The Roundabout's more far-flung productions,
``Cabaret'' at Studio 54, and ``Ashes to Ashes'' at the Gramercy
Theater on East 23d Street in Manhattan, are not affected.
</P>
<P>
   The company's new home, the 750-seat Selwyn Theater on West 42d
Street, is undergoing a $17 million renovation to be completed
around January. In the meantime, the Roundabout is to present a new
play, ``Hurrah at Last'' by Richard Greenberg, at the Gramercy. The
move from the Criterion forced postponement of another production,
``Sweet Bird of Youth'' in June. The 40,000 subscribers were
offered tickets to a non-Roundabout production, ``Death of a
Salesman,'' instead.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a familiar roller coaster ride for the Roundabout,
which barely had time to bask in the success of the Tony-award
winning ``Cabaret,'' ``A View From the Bridge'' and other Broadway
hits last season when a scaffold collapse on West 43rd Street
closed the Kit Kat Club, home of ``Cabaret,'' and briefly darkened
other productions. The accident cost the Roundabout $1.3 million in
lost ticket sales. Haimes said he did not know whether this can be
recouped by insurance. Renovating Studio 54 cost $1.7 million, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In September the Canadian-based producing behemoth Livent Inc.
named Haimes artistic director. Livent subsequently went into
bankruptcy and its partners, Garth H. Drabinsky and Myron I.
Gottlieb, were charged with fraud. With prospective buyers coming
forward to take over Livent, Haimes' prospects are uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   So, he said the other day in the emptying Criterion offices,
there was only one thing to do: hold a party. On June 6 the doors
will be opened for the last time for a super cast party for all
actors who performed at the Criterion, with a guest list that
ranges from F. Murray Abraham to Helen Mirren to Eli Wallach, among
a host of other marquee names.

ADVERTISING: TECHNOLOGY PUTS PRODUCTS IN TV SHOWS, VIRTUALLY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Calif., Ill.)  (rk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Another frontier is being crossed in the
commercialization of culture as digital technology has been used
for the first time to ``virtually'' place products in a prime-time
television entertainment program watched by American viewers.
</P>
<P>
   That milestone interpolation of advertisements where they had
not been before is being carefully studied by Madison Avenue as
part of its never-ending effort to wrap consumers in a cocoon of
sponsored imagery that range from the mentioning of brand-name
products in children's textbooks to the renaming of stadiums for
huge corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The insinuation of make-believe items into a make-believe story
occurred quietly on March 17, when computer-generated electronic
images of four products appeared briefly in the backgrounds of
scenes on the hourlong UPN series ``Seven Days.''
</P>
<P>
   The product images _ for Coca-Cola, fashion retailer Kenneth
Cole, Evian and the Wells Fargo bank _ were inserted into the
episode after it was completed by the producer, Paramount Network
Television, through a process developed by Princeton Video Image
Inc. that seeks to create images indistinguishable from actual
objects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to make them real,'' said Dennis Wilkinson,
president and chief executive at Princeton Video in Lawrenceville,
N.J., and ``look as if they were there when the show was originally
produced.''
</P>
<P>
   The Princeton Video technology, which is known as L-VIS _
pronounced, of course, ``Elvis'' and standing for live-video
insertion system _ has been used extensively during sporting events
like football and baseball games to create virtual billboards and
logos that can be seen only by viewers.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Philadelphia Phillies and San Francisco Giants
reached agreement last week with Princeton Video to use the
technology during telecasts of games during the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   And for the last year, Wilkinson said, Princeton Video has been
inserting virtual product placements into episodes of entertainment
programs broadcast by the Televisa network in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But the episode of ``Seven Days,'' a time-travel drama, may give
American consumers a preview of a future where their efforts to
avoid advertising by switching channels or muting the sound when
commercials come on are thwarted by marketers using sophisticated
technological tactics.
</P>
<P>
   The virtual product placements, supplementing the actual
products that may already be placed in a program, give marketers
another chance to expose their logos and packages to viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's yet another incursion into the public life by marketers
who are dreaming up every possible way to sneak into our
consciousness,'' said Michael Jacobson, executive director at the
Center for Science in the Public Interest, an advocacy organization
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Product placements, virtual or real, are an optimum way for
them to do that,'' he added, ``because they are ads that don't
appear to be ads.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers typically pay fees ranging from a few hundred
dollars to tens of thousands for product placements, which have
become increasingly prevalent as producers of television series and
films seek to mimic reality more closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to place products in positions where they'd
naturally be,' Wilkinson said. ``You don't have a blank toothpaste
tube or mouthwash bottle in your bathroom. You don't cover up your
Coke can.''

 NEW YORK: Coke can.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wilkinson has been discussing virtual product placements with
television production companies and networks in the United States
and Canada after gaining agreement from Televisa, part of the giant
Spanish-language television conglomerate Grupo Televisa SA owned by
Grupo Televicentro SA de CV.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, Wilkinson said, advertisers are paying $1,000 for
each insertion. But in the ``Seven Days'' episode, which featured
virtual objects like a Wells Fargo sign and an Evian bottle, no
fees were paid because the placements were a test. The test was
first reported last week by the trade publication The Hollywood
Reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an experiment to gauge viewer reaction, which is still
being evaluated,'' said Paul McGuire, a spokesman in Los Angeles
for UPN, owned by Viacom Inc., which also owns Paramount, and
Chris-Craft Industries. ``It was basically a trial balloon.''
</P>
<P>
   Some executives at media services agencies who decide whether to
buy commercial time on TV shows are hoping to burst the balloon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm big on exploitation,'' said Gene DeWitt, chairman at
DeWitt Media in New York, ``but not to the point where it's
self-defeating.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtual product placement is ``just another way to clutter up
the screen and distract people from the programming,'' he added.
``The quality of the viewing experience is something we glom onto.
It's not good for us if the people who want to watch the programs
are alienated.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Cohen, executive vice president for broadcast at Horizon
Media in New York, offered a similar assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in love with the idea,'' Cohen said, because on one
hand ``it runs the risk of being obtrusive'' and on the other hand
if the virtual image is ``there for only a couple of seconds so it
doesn't smack viewers in the face, the question is whether the
advertiser has gotten any real value.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen raised another objection: A product that is placed
virtually ``can't be used'' by an actor the way a real one can, he
said, ``it can only sit there.''
</P>
<P>
   Other media executives are endorsing the concept cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would just hope the networks will be very careful with this
and don't allow it to become a runaway train,'' said John
Muszynski, chief broadcast investment officer at Starcom Media
Services, the media unit of the Leo Burnett Co. in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would consider it,'' he added, ``but it depends on the
specific situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Igiel, executive vice president and U.S. broadcast
director at the Media Edge in New York, part of Young &AMP; Rubicam
Inc., described the process as ``an interesting new device to
enhance the value of television'' as an advertising medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heaven knows,'' he added, in an era of ``fractionalization and
remote controls, television can use all the help it can get'' in
that regard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've used it with football and it seemed fine to me,'' Igiel
said, ``not particularly intrusive. But if you're watching someone
walk down a hall full of products, I'm not sure it would be
particularly attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And there's the danger of a product in an inappropriate
place,'' he added, ``like a car in a bedroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Will advertisers have additional opportunities to determine if
virtual product placements will become as commonplace on the sets
of sitcoms as they are on the gridiron?
</P>
<P>
   The trend may be accelerated by the growth of co-production
deals, which make decisions on artistic and commercial issues like
product placement easier because there are ties between producers
and networks.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson said that Princeton Video was working on or discussing
additional virtual product placements with a broadcast network and
syndicators of two sitcoms that he declined to identify.
</P>
<P>
   Television networks and production companies offer mixed
responses to the prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, a unit of the Walt Disney Co. that has stringent
product-placement policies, is ``not doing this,'' said Susan
Sewell, a spokeswoman in New York. CBS in New York declined to
comment, but that network is deemed unlikely to inject virtual
products into prime-time programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very interesting idea,'' said Ed Lammi, executive vice
president for production at Columbia Tristar Television in Culver
City, Calif., a unit of the Sony Corp., ``but no one has approached
us directly.''
</P>
<P>
   And Paramount, the pioneer, is already looking beyond commercial
uses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the L-VIS technology can be used for product
placement,'' said Trisha Cardoso, a spokeswoman in Los Angeles for
Paramount, ``we believe this same technology may have a multitude
of uses and value for production,'' providing ``an opportunity to
creatively insert high-end special effects and a variety of
background locations for a real low cost.''

CONNECTIONS: PHILOSOPHY LIGHTS MINDS DARKENED BY MISFORTUNE

 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   During an unusual course in philosophy and literature that Earl
Shorris was teaching specifically for the poor and homeless, a
student who had a history of violent behavior telephoned Shorris.
</P>
<P>
   The student had become so angry at a colleague, he reported,
that he wanted ``to smack her up against the wall.'' Shorris feared
the worst. Was this a call from jail? No, because instead of
striking outward, the student had reflected inward and asked
himself, ``What would Socrates do?''
</P>
<P>
   Not even a university provost, I imagine, would raise such a
question in the heat of confrontation. But in his 1997 book on
American poverty, ``New American Blues,'' (W.W. Norton) Shorris
also tells of prisoners in a maximum-security prison reading
Boethius' ``Consolation of Philosophy,'' and of yet another
prisoner who recommended that Shorris take his homeless students to
museums and teach them Plato's ``Allegory of the Cave.''
</P>
<P>
   It is startling to read about lives that have been ruined by
criminal choices, crippling addictions, disturbed minds or
accumulated misfortunes being so touched by Great Books and High
Art. But Shorris has been proselytizing for their potential for
salvation for some years, and earlier this month, The New York
Times reported that his initial 1995 class, which was created after
intensive screening of candidates, has now become a model for a
five-year multistate program run by Bard College.
</P>
<P>
   There are also courses being taught in New York City and New
Brunswick, N.J., as well as in Seattle and Anchorage, Alaska, and
Shorris is also taking his message to British Columbia, Mexico and
France.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that all this is taking place in a period when so
much energy has been expended in universities to undercut the
authority of the very material Shorris is promoting to the
imprisoned and the homeless: Plato and Aristotle, Euripides and
Pericles, William Blake and symbolic logic.
</P>
<P>
   As Shorris makes clear in his book, one of the inspirations for
his enterprise was the educational philosophy of Robert Maynard
Hutchins in the 1950s at the University of Chicago, where Shorris
says he received ``the best education in America.'' The
undergraduate degree required 14 yearlong required courses and
allowed only two electives.
</P>
<P>
   But even the University of Chicago (where I did graduate work in
a program that had similarly ambitious devotion to Great Books),
has long since left behind such rigors, and is now trying to shed
its monastic reputation still further, increasing electives,
decreasing requirements and marketing itself as a more fun place.
Apparently, Shorris is advocating a more serious approach for the
poor than is often considered necessary or appropriate for college
students.
</P>
<P>
   But Shorris is also not the best advocate for such an
enterprise. He seeks, as he explains, to use the humanities for
political purposes. Thus, he first awakens a sense of resentment
among the students. ``You've been cheated,'' he says. ``Rich people
learn the humanities; you didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   And the humanities have a use, he says. They help people become
political, teaching them how to use power: ``If you want real
power, legitimate power, the kind that comes from the people and
belongs to the people, you must understand politics; the humanities
will help.''
</P>
<P>
   This does of course skew the ways Plato or Aristotle might be
read or museums might be visited, and the poor have been learning
the humanities for generations at public universities. Shorris'
approach risks turning all readings into power lessons, tapping
into students' horrific tales of evils done or evils suffered,
turning philosophical texts into variations on Machiavelli for the
disenfranchised.
</P>
<P>
   And to put it mildly, Shorris does not always inspire the
greatest of confidence with his own interpretations. He argues, for
example, that the study of the humanities should, politically,
``belong to the left'' because the study of the humanities ``is in
itself a redistribution of wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   He engages in a series of egregious misreadings of recent texts,
distorting, for example, the complicated views of the sociologist
Nathan Glazer, who has studied the causes and culture of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Shorris calls him ``a man in whom any form of social justice
produces an allergic reaction.'' He also quotes a passage from
Allan Bloom's controversial book ``The Closing of the American
Mind'' (Touchstone Books, 1988) that seems very clear.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom, who was attacking university culture, explained that his
experience was with students who had the luxury of pursuing a
liberal arts education, who were ``raised in comfort and the
expectation of ever-increasing comfort.'' Those very comforts,
Bloom suggested, actually contributed to a cursory understanding of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Shorris states that Bloom believed that only the wealthy are
``fit for a liberal education,'' that such an education should be
withheld from the poor. One can argue with things Bloom said, but
not with this, which Bloom did not say. Shorris' program of
teaching the traditional humanities is actually as politically
charged as the opposition to them.
</P>
<P>
   It may also be that Shorris is such a good teacher that his
motivations matter less than his ability to make the texts resonate
with the students' experience. Plato's cave may really be the best
analogy.
</P>
<P>
   Plato is too often portrayed as an ideologue, censoring poetry
and music in his perfect state, creating rigid classes and
philosopher kings. But this is a cave view of his more supple
philosophy. Recall that cave: prisoners are underground in a large
chamber watching shadows dancing on the walls. They create
elaborate theories about their shadow universe. They construct
crude notions of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day their heads are turned. They see the source of the
light in a cave fire and realize they have been contemplating mere
illusions. The task of philosophy is to show eventually that even
fire is just a distant image of a finer light. The philosopher
leads the prisoners out of the cave into the light of the sun.

<TEXT>
<P>
   At each stage of the way, the prisoners understand their world
according to the limits of their experience. The power of the
greatest books is that, in effect, they know to whom they speak.
</P>
<P>
   They will first make a connection at the level of immediate
experience, but in the hands of an expert teacher they will then
begin to undercut such simple reactions. They will reveal the
flickerings of the fire, leading the student into new
understandings. But they do not provide a final answer; rather,
they provide ways of thinking. They do not answer an ideological
call; they undermine it.
</P>
<P>
   Shorris' political appeal may just be the inadequate first step,
taking place within the cave. Once hooked by such habits of
thought, though, readers might be led by these books and their
teachers to go further. Those with intimate experience of society's
depths might also perceive something that more comfortable readers
might have missed as well. Together, as in a Platonic dialogue, the
netherworld participants are eventually granted glimpses of
sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   What a powerful idea it is: to engage those who are most wounded
and most wounding in a project of moral, social and intellectual
illumination! Certainly there is also something distinctly American
about this project: democratic in spirit, elite in aspiration,
salvational in texture.
</P>
<P>
   The puzzle is why this approach to Great Books, however skewed
an inspiration, is now becoming established at the cave's darkest
corners, but is viewed with increasing skepticism by institutions
supposedly thriving in the sunlit, open air.

 &HT;    Women should have greater role in setting public policy
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lydia Jankovic, a lawyer from Yugoslavia, now an
Atlanta resident, has a suggestion U.S. policymakers should take to
heart if we ever get back to the negotiating table on the Kosovo
crisis. She says a woman from the region should be in the
negotiations. These women don't want war, she told Atlanta Journal
reporter Virginia Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Jankovic's comments caused me to stand back and think about the
silliness of the issues American women sometimes rally around:
create women's offices of this and that; demand that women get
equal tee times on the golf course; pass laws to confirm that women
can nurse their babies in public. (The Georgia General Assembly
just passed such a thing.)
</P>
<P>
   At the core of Jankovic's observation about her war-torn country
is the real reason why having more equal numbers of women in
national and international decision-making is necessary. Women, by
biology and life experience, whether they are mothers or not, are
nurturers more than are most men. They weigh the human costs and
benefits of domestic and foreign policy more heavily.
</P>
<P>
   Recall that the singular female to rise to power in Serbia,
Biljana Plavsic, who became president of the Serb-controlled half
of Bosnia, broke with Radovan Karadzic over his refusal to go along
with the Dayton peace accords. Plavsic had served in the Karadzic
regime and was initially thought to be as bent on ethnic cleansing
as he. But at some point, she decided she could no longer stomach
his inhumanity.
</P>
<P>
   As Jankovic put it, ``The women are tired of war.'' Think about
it. Why are the women _ be they Serb or Albanian, Christian or
Muslim _ tired of war more than the men? Because eking out food,
shelter, clothing and some semblance of security for helpless
children falls on them. And it's harder in many ways than toting a
gun. That doesn't mean they're ``softer.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Madeleine Albright, America's first female
secretary of state, to recommend war is aimed at preventing further
ethnic killing and at halting genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Without trivializing the current international conflict, women
political leaders at the national and state levels need to focus on
long-term issues and stop using up so much energy on the symbolic.
While women leaders push for female health initiatives (such as
24-hour stays after mastectomies) on a micro level, the macro issue
is insistence on quality care even if it cuts into private profits.
That issue is part of an even greater reform need: campaign
finance, the mostly male-dominated money contributions to
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Women don't need more women's offices and programs. In Georgia
and other states, women need places on transportation, banking,
environment, utility and consumer boards and authorities. They need
to chair them. Georgia's new governor should appoint many women,
not just a few tokens, to the new 15-member Georgia Regional
Transportation Authority
</P>
<P>
   A few women who arrive at powerful posts mimic the good-ol'-boy
tactics. Georgia school Superintendent Linda Schrenko paid a former
Braves pitcher $25,000 this year to lobby for more education money.
She said it was the only way to get through to an all-male power
structure in the Legislature. Fortunately, other Georgia women
leaders, like Cathy Cox, the new secretary of state, found
mustering the facts and making sound arguments worked.
</P>
<P>
   Women's studies programs at various colleges should stop staging
one-time seminars and start forming state or regional policy
institutes to collect data and to analyze women's public policy
needs _ and more significantly, how to strengthen women's public
policy roles.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   &UR; EASY RIDERS, RAGING BULLS: HOW THE SEX-DRUGS-AND-ROCK 'N' ROLL
GENERATION SAVED HOLLYWOOD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Peter Biskind. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $15.
</P>
<P>
   This gossipy account recalls the heyday of filmmakers like
Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola in the 1970s, when the
industry was driven by prodigious amounts of talent, hubris and
libido. The author ``knows where the bodies are buried ... and his
eye for telling detail turns up enough fresh insights to keep the
book engrossing,'' Joseph McBride wrote here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTS ON THE MELON: A COLLECTION OF POEMS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Virginia Hamilton Adair.
</P>
<P>
   Modern Library, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 83 and blind for some years, the author overcame
her long reticence and published her first collection of verse. The
poems are brief and often deal with dark subjects -- Hiroshima, for
instance, or her husband's suicide -- but they cast a bright
afterglow and feature striking metaphors. ``She speaks directly and
unaffectedly, in an accent stripped of mannerism and allusion,''
Brad Leithauser said here in 1996. `` &UR; ANTS ON THE MELON &LR;  exhibits
enough formal variety, freshness and intelligence to confirm ...
that Adair is a poet of accomplishment and originality.''  &UR; THE
CREATION OF THE NIGHT SKY &LR; , by Nicholas Christopher
(Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $13), is a collection of poems exploring
the eternal realm toward which the human spirit aspires. The book
includes a group of linked poems about three characters who cross
paths in a single night; in 1998 our reviewer, Melanie Rehak,
called this ``a haunting, multifaceted work filled with
astonishing, surreal images.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RED-TAILS IN LOVE: A WILDLIFE DRAMA IN CENTRAL PARK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Marie Winn. Vintage Departures, $13.
</P>
<P>
   This affectionate account chronicles the stubborn attempt of a
young male hawk to build a life for himself and his offspring in
Central Park, and the dedicated band of bird-watchers (of whom the
author is one) who monitor its five-year struggle. ``Winn infects
the reader with her enthusiasm for life in the park,'' Patricia T.
O'Conner wrote here in 1998. ``And she tells many vivid and
affecting stories.''  &UR; WICKERBY: AN URBAN PASTORAL &LR; , by Charles
Siebert (Three Rivers, $12), is an unusual memoir whose poles are
the author's native Brooklyn and southern Quebec, specifically a
rundown cabin he escapes to when the city overwhelms him. ``To
reconnect humans with nature is one thing, but Siebert's enterprise
is to reconnect the city with nature,'' Verlyn Klinkenborg said in
these pages last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE ANTELOPE WIFE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Louise Erdrich. Harper Perennial, $13.
</P>
<P>
   This lyrical novel features multiple narratives of contemporary
American Indians living out their joys and sorrows on the
Midwestern prairie, but at its core are two related stories of
troubled marriages. ``There is light as well as darkness in this
fictional universe, and encountering it offers pain and
exhilaration in equal measure,'' Diana Postlethwaite said here in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MARY THROUGH THE CENTURIES: HER PLACE IN THE HISTORY OF
CULTURE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Jaroslav Pelikan. Yale University, $14. A historian of
Christian theology explores Marian devotion in music, art and
literature, presenting Mary as the bridge that links Christianity
to Judaism and Islam. ``There can be no doubt that the Queen of
Heaven would be pleased with this accolade, and no reader will come
away from the work without profit,'' Jo Ann Kay McNamara wrote here
in 1996. The same publisher has reissued  &UR; SAINTS &AMP; SINNERS: A
HISTORY OF THE POPES &LR; , by Eamon Duffy ($18.95), a colorful overview
of the papacy and how it has shaped the Roman Catholic Church. The
book ``includes both good illustrations and a distinguished text,''
Henry Chadwick said here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A QUIET LIFE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Beryl Bainbridge. Carroll &AMP; Graf, $10.95. This novel follows
the unraveling of a British family after World War II, culminating
in a darkly complicated domestic tragedy. ``Bainbridge's new novel
works with the sly precision of a trap,'' Julia O'Faolain wrote
here in 1977. ``She is a subtle and protean writer.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE EVERLASTING STORY OF NORY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Nicholson Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Vintage Contemporaries, $12. The novelist uses his celebrated
skills in literary dissection to comb the exuberant inner life of a
9-year-old American girl spending a semester at an English school.
``Much of the novel is pleasantly comic and, as always with Baker
... the delight is found in the details and the madcap invention,''
Robert McCrum said here in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE FEMINIZATION OF AMERICAN CULTURE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Ann Douglas. Noonday/Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $15. The author
argues that clergymen and sentimental female writers collaborated
in the 19th century to transform popular entertainment and set the
stage for modern consumer culture. In 1977 our reviewer, Gerda
Lerner, praised ``the textural richness and methodological
sophistication of this intellectual and literary history.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LOVE IN A BLUE TIME &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Hanif Kureishi. Scribner, $11. These short stories revolve
around middle-aged protagonists struggling to cope with stifling
marriages and responsibilities in a world that's stopped being fun.
Kureishi has ``the master's touch when it comes to making us feel
we've been thrust into the thick of things,'' Laura Miller wrote
here in 1997.

`ROBERT FROST': PENETRATING COMMENTARY, PLEASURE TO READ 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(jw) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why yet another biography of Robert Frost (1874-1963), when more
than a dozen lives of the poet have already been published, among
them Lawrance Thompson's three-volume official biography, ``Robert
Frost: The Early Years, 1874-1915,'' ``Robert Frost: The Years of
Triumph, 1915-1938'' and ``Robert Frost: The Later Years,
1938-1963,'' the latter written with R.H. Winnick?
</P>
<P>
   Jay Parini _ a poet, novelist and biographer who teaches English
at Middlebury College _ addresses this question in an afterword,
``Frost and His Biographers,'' to his graceful ``Robert Frost: A
Life.'' Here he argues that to date Frost biographies have been
defined by three phases. The first began with a view of Frost as a
man of good sense and eventually culminated in a caricature of
Frost as the ``farmer-poet offering homespun wisdom from the
lecture platform.''
</P>
<P>
   The corrective to this view was provided by Thompson's
monumental biography. But for all the valuable detail it offered,
it presented Frost as a monster and misanthrope; in Parini's words,
``a selfish, egomaniacal, dour, cruel and angry man.'' This
negative portrait prevailed until the third phase, when the focus
of various Frost studies shifted to his poetry, and, as a result, a
more complex and contradictory view of the man began to emerge. A
throwback to phase two, in Parini's view, was Jeffrey Meyers'
``Robert Frost: A Biography'' (1996), which, he argues
convincingly, was a compendium of sensationalist misinformation and
a grotesque misreading of Frost's work.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Parini reasons, is that biography is too often
misconstrued as mere facts, whereas what someone writing a life
must discover is the story, or ``mythos,'' composed by the facts.
Thompson's life was driven by a distorting mythos, Parini argues.
His own hope is to find in the facts ``a fresh mythos.'' His
intention is ``not to supplant or overtake previous biographers and
critics but merely to add a significant layer.''
</P>
<P>
   So the raw material of this biography is not new but freshly
culled and arranged and told with emphasis on both the life and the
poetry. Parini hesitates to say that Frost suffered from bipolar
disorder; ``one cannot, retrospectively, make such a diagnosis,''
he writes. But depression always threatened, made worse by the
troubles of his children, to whom he was not as bad a father as
previous biographers have insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting off the depression, Frost moved in two directions,
Parini writes. He plunged deeply into nature, which he saw as a
metaphor for the spirit, but more concretely than Emerson, so that
when he was a climber of his birches, his objective was not to
reach the sky but to be grounded like Antaeus. Yet his aim was
never to merge with the nature he wrote about in his poems, but
rather to find ``portent in little,'' as he put it in the poem
``Design.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is intriguing to consider how many of Frost's best poems
reflect on the act of creation,'' Parini writes, ``the process of
breaking down the forms of reality given by the world and remaking
them, restoring them to freshness.'' He illustrates this point at
length in his analyses of poems like ``Birches,'' ``Mending Wall,''
``After Apple-Picking,'' ``The Ax-Helve'' and many others.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Parini argues, Frost's fear of depression and
loneliness drove him out onto the public stage. Here, as a teacher,
lecturer and ``sayer'' of his poems, he evolved an image that
although at odds with the subtlety of his writing, served both to
create an audience for poetry readings and to define the role of
the college writer in residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert Frost: A Life'' is a pleasure to read, combining as it
does penetrating commentary on the poetry and good illustrative
anecdotes. There is, for example, the story of Frost's first
meeting with Pound, who upon starting to read a copy of Frost's
first book, ``A Boy's Will,'' said, ``You don't mind our liking
this, do you?'' To which Frost replied, ``Oh, no, go right ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, Parini is not entirely persuasive in his more benign
view of Frost. Only if you believe that children are shaped
exclusively by heredity can you accept that mere extreme ``bad
luck'' accounts for why two of his daughters suffered mental
breakdowns while his son ended up committing suicide. While
instability ran in his family, Frost cannot have been easy to grow
up with.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the story Parini tells is more than palatable. Particularly
satisfying are his analyses of Frost's craft as a poet, especially
why Frost said that ignoring the formal rules of verse would be
like playing tennis with the net down. What made Frost unique was
not merely the vernacular sound of his voice, or what he himself
called his striving after ``the sounds of sense.'' In an analysis
of lines from the poem ``Mowing,'' Parini shows how Frost's
vernacular creates a tension with the underlying iambic pentameter.
</P>
<P>
   He writes: ``The poetry, in Frost as in most good poets, occurs
in the difference between the abstract possibility of the line and
its vernacular performance, where stresses fall as they do normally
in human speech.'' He concludes: ``Without that slight tug toward
the formally perfect line, however remote, there would be no
poetry. The form, indeed, makes the poetry possible.''
</P>
<P>
   This tug between the formal and the vernacular is only one of
the many contradictions that make Parini's version of Frost so
intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   As he concludes: ``He was a loner who liked company; a poet of
isolation who sought a mass audience; a rebel who sought to fit in.
Although a family man to the core, he frequently felt alienated
from his wife and children and withdrew into reveries. While
preferring to stay at home, he traveled more than any poet of his
generation to give lectures and readings, even though he remained
terrified of public speaking to the end. ... In a sense, Frost made
himself a representative American by amplifying his individuality,
by finding a voice for Everyman in the persona of the Lone Striker.
By making himself eccentric, he found the center.''
</P>
<P>
   By making Frost more complex and contradictory than his previous
biographers have, Parini has brought him more sharply into focus.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Out of symbolic modesty _ or maybe impatience _
Candice Carpenter took the subway rather than a limousine back to
her office from the Wall Street headquarters of Goldman Sachs
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   She was returning after watching the stock of Ivillage, the
Internet company she co-founded, open for trading the day after its
initial public offering, quadrupling its initial price of $24
before closing at $80.125.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that got me excited,'' Ms. Carpenter said of coming
back to Ivillage's offices at 170 Fifth Ave., ``was walking the
halls and seeing the kids so delirious that their hard work had
paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   During the next few months there are likely to be a lot of
delirious executives and employees as more than a dozen of New
York's Internet companies try to go public. The Mining Co., for
example, another prominent member of the group, saw its stock more
than double after shares began trading Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The offerings, of course, will create a windfall payoff for the
work put into these companies, with their young programmers and
producers holding options worth _ on paper _ tens of thousands, or
even hundreds of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the company founders who really have the right to be
delirious. Ms. Carpenter and Scott Kurnit, chief executive of The
Mining Co., each now have paper wealth of more than $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Along with financial rewards, the successful public offerings
come as more than a little vindication for Silicon Alley, the
collection of entrepreneurs trying to make a go of Internet
businesses in New York.
</P>
<P>
   They have had to fight harder for respect and for financing than
their Silicon Valley rivals on the other side of the continent. The
technology mainstream considered the New York companies too lavish
in their spending, too focused on content by writers and designers
_ and simply too far from Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind all that. The success of Ivillage's offering
indicates that there are no hard feelings now between Silicon Alley
and the great wired masses of Internet stock buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, most New York Internet companies going public
are online extensions of the city's traditional industries. There
are media companies like Ivillage, which provides women's services;
Mining, an Internet directory that relies on human guides, not
machines; and Star Media, an online service for Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   There are offshoots of Wall Street, including Wit Capital, an
online investment bank, and Multex, which distributes
brokerage-firm research. The advertising business is represented by
Razorfish, an interactive agency, and Media Metrix, a company that
measures the audience size of World Wide Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Companies in other New York industries, like publishing and
fashion, are spinning out online divisions. These include
Barnesandnoble.com from Barnes &AMP; Noble, the bookseller, and Iturf,
an offshoot of Delia's, a maker of clothing for teen-age girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York has become the center of the Internet content
business,'' said Fred Wilson, a principal with Flatiron Partners, a
venture capital unit of Chase Manhattan. ``People said that all the
technology plays and all the infrastructure plays have been done.
Now it's time for what you can build on top of the technology.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some companies going public here would be just as
natural in Silicon Valley, including Juno, an e-mail service
financed in part by News Corp., and Mapquest, which makes
electronic maps.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing to base in New York was ``a real gamble,'' said Kevin
O'Connor, chief executive of Doubleclick, an online advertising
network that went public in February 1998 and has a value of $3.2
billion, the most of any Silicon Alley company. After starting his
business in Atlanta in 1996, he considered moving to California,
but chose New York because ``we're a tech company and a media
company, but mostly a media company.''
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, as technology stocks plummeted and investors
shunned public offerings, many Silicon Alley companies feared they
would never achieve their goals of going public. But the dark days
lasted only a few weeks, and two small New York Internet companies,
Earthweb and Theglobe.com, went public in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than validation for Silicon Alley, the herd of public
offerings could simply mean that investors are so addicted to
Internet stocks that they will buy anything, even something as
improbable as a technology company based in New York.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Indeed, the Ivillage offering went forward, at twice the
projected price, mere days after the company's former chief
financial officer accused Ms. Carpenter of overly aggressive
accounting. Ivillage says it stands by its financial reports, which
were audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ivillage is a lesson that the companies with the highest
profile in the media earn the highest valuations, even in the face
of accounting questions,'' said Alec Ellison, a managing director
of Broadview, a New Jersey investment bank. ``In the absence of any
rational metric with which to value a company, investors are
betting on the future, and that means image and brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are quick to caution that for any investor with a time
horizon longer than the life of a fruit fly, nearly all of these
companies are highly speculative. Even the biggest and most
established, like Ivillage, are swimming in red ink with no clear
way to profits in sight. Some other companies are so small and
unproved that in earlier days they would have hardly qualified for
a bank loan, never mind a stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   Whether good for investors or not, the money flow benefits the
New York economy as some entrepreneurs apply profits from these
offerings to start new companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wealth is the next-generation seed capital that will be
reinvested in startups and will help strengthen the whole ecosystem
of new media in New York,'' said Brian Horey, a partner at
Lawrence, Smith &AMP; Horey, a venture capital firm, and a founder of
the New York New Media Association. ``Over the last 30 years, this
has turned Silicon Valley into an enormous economic flywheel.''
</P>
<P>
   For many of those at Ivillage, though, the talk is less of
pushing that flywheel than of pumping money into the local economy
in different ways: buying an apartment, taking a vacation, paying
for a nice wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the first meeting where we talked about the
options, and they told us they might be worth a thousand dollars
some day if the company grew,'' said Kate Hanley, a producer at
Ivillage since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were like, `Yeah, but we want a raise.' A lot of us had no
idea what an IPO was. Now, I've learned what a limit order is.''

   MS-KEVORKIAN-TWOTAKES (KANSAS CITY, Mo.) _ Regina Merrick never
knew Patricia Smith, but their paths seemed destined to cross. Like
Merrick, Smith was a nurse, a mother and an active member of the
Baptist Church. She also suffered from the same debilitating form
of multiple sclerosis. On Aug. 22, 1996, Smith, of Lee's Summit,
decided to end her pain with the aid of suicide doctor Jack
Kevorkian. Her death haunted Merrick, now 45, who read newspaper
articles and watched television reports about Smith's suicide in
Pontiac, Mich. Last week, as Kevorkian went on trial and was

   He was a key player in the 1995 Dayton peace accords _ seen by
some Serbs as an abandonment of nationalist interests in Bosnia.
And he has also been accused of abandoning Serbs in Croatia and
eastern Slovenia, the former Yugoslav provinces that declared their
independence in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has seen his popularity dwindle in recent years as the
effects of international sanctions have worn on. Accusations that
he had rigged elections prompted mass demonstrations in 1997. The
protests were fueled by independent news media and manned by
university students.
</P>
<P>
   He has since wiped out all but the state-controlled newspapers,
television and radio. The university system, meantime, has seen
academic freedom disappear and the faculty ranks filled with
political appointments.
</P>
<P>
   If Milosevic survives the present crisis, his presidency will
end in 2001. But his reign will not, Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will have gained so much influence over the various spheres
of government so that even after the presidency, he'll be in
control,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   And who, if anyone, controls Milosevic?
</P>
<P>
   Many critics point to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Her name is Mirjana Markovic. She is a lifelong Marxist _ ``The
Red Witch,'' as her many detractors in Yugoslavia tag her. The
sociology professor and magazine columnist is thought to have
orchestrated her husband's rise to power. She remains Milosevic's
one true confidante.
</P>
<P>
   ``She holds the handlebars, and Slobo pumps the pedals,'' said
former Yugoslav army chief of staff Gen. Stevan Mirkovic in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Her magazine columns blend musings about fashions and the
weather with cryptic comments on regional politics. If she chides a
Serbian politician or a Belgrade businessman one month, the target
of her ridicule often will be searching for work the next. So
prescient are her writings that Yugoslav readers have dubbed her
column ``The Horoscope.''
</P>
<P>
   Markovic's political agenda can be traced to her childhood. Her
mother, a communist guerrilla during World War II, reportedly was
captured and executed by German Nazis when Mirjana Markovic was 1
year old. According to a 1997 feature in the Chicago Tribune, the
first lady of Yugoslavia now wears a gardenia in her hair because
her mother wore one in the only picture that Markovic saw of her.
</P>
<P>
   Young Markovic was raised by an affluent family with close ties
to Josip Broz Tito, the charismatic leader of communist Yugoslavia.
She met her future husband when both were schoolchildren in the
town of Pozarevac. Milosevic soon became active in student politics
and was named to the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Today the ruling couple, ``Slobo and Mira,'' have a grown son
and daughter who contradict Milosevic's old-world dogma.
</P>
<P>
   The son, Marko, owns a disco and races cars; he's wrecked 19 of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to have a girl, music, a car and a gun,'' he once told
an interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   His sister, Marija, once ran a rock radio station in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   For years the family's flashy lifestyle triggered jokes and
editorial cartoons across the region. But the ridicule has quieted
in recent months as Milosevic has kicked out journalists, driven
thousands of Kosovars from their homes and ordered soldiers to hunt
down rebels.
</P>
<P>
   From here, public opinion in Yugoslavia could go any direction,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If NATO can exact enough casualties in the Serbian
heartland,'' said Bassuener of the Balkan Action Council, ``it
could bring Milosevic down. But it's going to require some internal
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If his army gets to thinking, `We're going to get annihilated
here,' I could see someone going in there and dragging Slobo from
his palace. Serbia does have a history of killing its leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Others argue that same history augurs in Milosevic's favor. It
is a history that Milosevic now seems willing to embrace at all
costs _ a history of unforgotten suffering and almost
self-destructive defiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``People there may oppose Milosevic on a lot of things, but not
on the issue of Kosovo,'' said Ellis of the American Bar
Association's Central and East European Initiative. ``They're not
going to abandon him as long he represents that cause.''

<P>
   Your newsstand is overflowing.
</P>
<P>
   It's stacked to the rafters with People, Teen People and People
en Espanol. There's Country Living and Country Living Country
Gardener and Country Living Healthy Living.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget Traditional Home and Traditional Home Decorator
Showhouse and Traditional Home Renovation Style.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, publishers have come to see the spinoff
as the future of magazines. Spinoffs are new magazines that take
the title of the original publication and, by adding a subtitle
like ``For women,'' ``Finance'' or ``Gardener,'' attempt to attract
new readership and provide a new marketplace for advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly endless iterations are only accelerating. This
week, Sports Illustrated for Women, the brainchild of Time Warner's
Sports Illustrated publishing staff, will join its firstborn
sibling, Sports Illustrated for Kids, on the newsstand. And they,
in turn, will be joined at the same time by the National Geographic
Society's National Geographic Adventure, the offspring of National
Geographic.
</P>
<P>
   Even Conde Nast, previously reluctant to risk diluting any of
its brand names, has thrown its hat into the ring. The unit of
Advance Publications announced last week that in partnership with
Ideas Publishing Group, a Miami company, it would publish Vogue en
Espanol.
</P>
<P>
   The pace is picking up faster than you can say ``Sports
Illustrated for Teen People en Espanol.'' And with the barrage of
new entries, the problems with spinoffs are beginning to show
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Skepticism from the advertising industry toward magazines deemed
to be stretching the brand name can result in a disappointing
number of ad pages. Cost-conscious publishers tend to load up _ and
annoy _ primary editorial staffs with the responsibilities of
producing a second, or even third, magazine. Consumers and
newsstand dealers get confused if logos are not different enough.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, they just plain fail, even with the power of a
great brand _ like Meredith Corp.'s Better Homes and Gardens or
even The Christian Science Monitor _ behind them.
</P>
<P>
   The Magazine Publishers of America keeps no records of how many
magazines a year are spinoffs, but Dr. Samir Husni, a professor of
journalism at the University of Mississippi who tracks magazine
startups, estimated that 20 percent of new magazines in 1998 were
spun off existing publications, compared with just 5 percent five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a magazine market of falling newsstand sales _ two-thirds of
all magazines reported declining newsstand sales in the second half
of 1998, according to Capell's Circulation Report _ one of the
primary advantages of a spinoff is that it appears to be risk-free;
a publisher can say it is merely testing an offspring publication
as a one-shot or a special-interest publication.
</P>
<P>
   If readers respond to the newsstand product, the publishers will
spin off the title officially _ as Rodale Press did with
Prevention's Guide to Men's Health, a one-shot magazine that became
the robustly successful Men's Health _ and announce a victory. If
the magazine does not find a sustainable market, the publisher can
explain it away as a special-interest publication that it does not
intend to revive, and still pocket the one-time revenue.
</P>
<P>
   On the marketing level, spinning off a new title takes advantage
of a company's existing brand. On an economic level, the cost is
usually minimal around start-up time because one editorial staff is
doing the work of two magazines.
</P>
<P>
   And from the psychological-developmental level, publishers see
spinoffs as incubators for future readers. The president of Hearst
Magazines, Cathleen Black, sees a junior version of Cosmopolitan _
aimed at girls, due on newsstands this fall _ as a way ``to
graduate them up to the big sister publication when they're
older.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Wall, the publisher of Newsweek magazine, said that Teen
Newsweek _ which will be sent to schools and subscribers in
September _ is a way to ``build a media habit among young readers.
'' Earlier this month, The New York Times and Scholastic Inc.
announced that they would publish a news magazine for teen-agers,
to be called The New York Times Upfront.
</P>
<P>
   And on a practical level, slipping a spinoff onto the newsstands
is easier than sneaking into a multiplex matinee on Sunday.
Magazine publishers do not have to approach and sell newsstand
distributors on the new concept or negotiate new contracts for the
newsstand space, said Daniel Capell, an authority on magazine
circulation and the editor of Capell's Circulation Report.
</P>
<P>
   But the editor in chief of American Express Publishing's Travel
&AMP; Leisure, Nancy Novgorod, pointed out that sometimes newsstand
dealers get confused about which title is which.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big concern,'' she said, adding that she recently saw
that a newsstand dealer in Dulles Airport in Washington had
confused her magazines, and only displayed copies of Travel &AMP;
Leisure Golf, not Travel &AMP; Leisure.
</P>
<P>
   And she said that the company was bound by postal restrictions
not to make the cover of Travel &AMP; Leisure Family markedly different
from Travel &AMP; Leisure, so that it could avoid extra fees that would
be charged if it were a separate magazine. ``And when that magazine
goes on the newsstand, people get confused,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all spinoffs survive. Times Mirror Magazines spun Popular
Science magazine off into Popular Science for Kids in 1995, which
lasted for five issues; The Christian Science Monitor introduced
World Monitor magazine, which folded after three years when the
company decided to invest in other areas of the media, despite
reaching a monthly circulation of 300,000 readers. Better Homes and
Gardens Home Garden magazine, a 1995 spinoff of Better Homes and
Gardens, hung around for eight issues.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And the theoretical convenience of spinning off can be eclipsed
by practical matters like financing, staffing, advertising and
plain old editorial hey-that-was-my-idea-first adversity.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Outside Magazine, the owner Larry Burke _ the
chief executive of Mariah Media Inc. _ chose to spin off Women
Outside when he saw that according to Mediamark Research Inc., a
company that charts reader demographics, Outside was attracting
large numbers of women readers who would pick up the magazine after
their male friends or spouses had already read it.
</P>
<P>
   But in his enthusiasm, Burke overloaded his existing staff with
work on developing last year's test issue of Women Outside. One
result was that the added stress contributed in part to six staff
members quitting the company, said former staff members and Burke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly saw some sacrifices being made,'' said Burke,
referring to the burdens placed on his Outside staff while they
were finishing the test issue of Women Outside. ``But with
additional competitive magazines coming into the marketplace, I
thought it would be best to hire an additional team promptly.''
(The first issue of Women Outside will appear on newsstands on June
1, with a new, separate staff.)
</P>
<P>
   At Time Inc., a different problem has arisen, one of a spinoff
first enthusiastically embraced and then abandoned temporarily in
the corporate maze. Last fall, Lisa Gabor, then an editor at In
Style magazine, wrote a proposal suggesting a magazine (the working
title: Biz Style) that would be spun off In Style, the monthly
celebrity bible. Norman Pearlstine, the editor in chief of Time
Inc., thought the idea was terrific, and so did the editors of In
Style.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was one of the top editors of In Style,'' Pearlstine said.
``She had the idea of doing something that was more connected to
business and by extension to men.''
</P>
<P>
   But the editors of In Style, who are already developing a bridal
spinoff and whose readership is predominantly women, asked Ms.
Gabor to take her idea to a group more accommodating to the male
market. Ms. Gabor and her idea then moved to the Business
Information Group _ the group that includes Fortune, Money and
probably the least style-conscious of the Time Inc. magazines,
Mutual Funds magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Because Fortune already produces a special issue based on a
similar notion called Business Life every fall, Ms. Gabor found
herself competing against an existing part-time title, which
Fortune staff members felt already covered ``men and their toys and
moguls on ranches,'' in the words of one staff member. Pearlstine
said the magazine was being developed and may appear as a
stand-alone, with no other magazine's imprimatur on it.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the advertising possibilities for a magazine
like Biz Style are appealing; the Fortune Business Life special
issue attracts new advertisers to Fortune each year, said Fortune's
publisher, Jolene Sykes.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, advertisers are attracted to spinoff families because
they get discounted prices for buying packages of advertising in
several related magazines at once. But on the down side, the
advertising industry is wary of publishers overly stretching their
brand names.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very adamant when I'm in the room with magazine publishers
who want to extend their brand to women,'' said Alan Jurmain, the
media director at Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS. ``I have a hard time
believing that women need their own magazine to talk to them about
stocks splitting or sports.'' Jurmain said that Sports Illustrated
for Women ``is an uphill trek.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're assuming that the brand is that elastic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The People division at Time Inc. has proved that, at least for
now, its brand name is supple and elastic. Teen People, introduced
in February 1998, with a 500,000 rate base _ the circulation
guaranteed to advertisers _ now has a circulation of 1,279,000,
with a guaranteed rate base of 1.2 million. Ad pages have doubled
in the first year, to 92.5 in this year's April issue from 45 pages
in last April's issue, said a Teen People spokeswoman. (The
magazine is not yet monitored by the Publishers Information Group,
which charts advertising revenue.)
</P>
<P>
   In Style's ad pages have quadrupled _ to 1,939 in 1998 from 510
in 1995 _ since it was introduced, and circulation has doubled, to
more than 1.2 million in 1998 from 668,000 in 1995, according to
the Audit Bureau of Circulation. At the same time, some of their
success can be attributed to the continued growth of People, which
saw its ad revenue rise to $626.5 million in 1998 from $437.6
million in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Moore, president of the People division at Time Inc. _ the
group that includes People, In Style, Teen People and People en
Espanol _ is a cheerleader for the roomy People brand and sees
endless possibilities. She said a title like Teen People en Espanol
for Girls was not out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a need for it in the market, we'll publish it,''
Ms. Moore said, and added: ``Some people look at the newsstand and
see it as crowded. I look at it and see wide open spaces waiting to
be filled with more offspring.''

<P>
   ... when modern medicine doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't supposed to be this way. When Patricia Smith was
diagnosed with MS in 1987, she was worried but hopeful. Many people
with the disease, she was told, don't become severely disabled.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1993 the multiple sclerosis forced her to cut back and
retire from nursing. She took a desk job, but she stopped working
altogether in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was bedridden,'' David Smith said. ``She lost the ability
to swallow, she was losing her vision, she had tremors, she
couldn't control her bowels. We were led to believe she'd die in
December of '96.''
</P>
<P>
   In March 1996, Patricia Smith began communicating with Kevorkian
while her husband was at work. She didn't tell him until Kevorkian
reviewed her medical records and accepted her as a patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of discussions, my wife and I,'' David Smith
recalled. To cover his wife's medical expenses, he was working two
part-time jobs in addition to his job at the Jackson County
Department of Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were lots of ramifications, religiouswise,'' he said.
``You can't talk about it all the time. You have to continue with
the daily basics. In the end, it was what my wife wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   David Smith would not reveal how his wife contacted Kevorkian.
He described the process as a ``network you go through. There's a
coordinated effort among several players. You don't just make a
call.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Smith stayed in touch with Kevorkian for months. He
counseled her. He told her to make peace with her family and God.
Once she had done that, she was to contact him again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to accept her decision a couple of weeks before we went
to see Kevorkian,'' David Smith said. ``We spent many hours
talking, planning. Things like, `How are you going to raise our
daughter?' When I made my peace with her, I made peace with
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the call came.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may think you have two more weeks, and then the phone
rings and you have to go now,'' Smith said. ``My wife spent hours
and hours on the phone the day before we left, but you can't tell
everybody. Some people, if they find out, they'll do anything to
stop you from doing it. Less than 10 family members knew about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Only David Smith and his father-in-law, James Poland,
accompanied Patricia Smith on the trip to Michigan. A larger group,
they feared, would attract attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process is undignified,'' David Smith said. ``Hurry and
scurry, hotel reservations, saying your goodbyes. Even a guy on
death row knows when he's going to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should not have to go to Michigan. You should be able to
do it at home or in a local hospital. She had to say goodbye to our
daughter at the door on the way out. You can imagine what that was
like.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian doesn't charge his patients, Smith said. The family
had to pay for their trip to Michigan, but Kevorkian took care of
the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Smith would not say where Kevorkian met them. He spent several
hours with the family and asked Patricia if she wanted to go home
and die naturally. She said no. He gave a detailed explanation of
what he was going to do. Then, as David Smith watched, Kevorkian
stuck a tube in her arm and videotaped the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in shock,'' he said. ``I remember some things. Just
seeing her limp was real difficult. I miss my wife dearly. I regret
that she is not here, but that is my only regret.''
</P>
<P>
   David Smith went to a Pontiac restaurant and waited for
Kevorkian while he took the body to the emergency room of a Pontiac
hospital, where Patricia Smith was pronounced dead at 11:55 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   When Kevorkian met him at the restaurant, ``people treated him
like a celebrity,'' Smith said. ``He acted as if almost nothing
happened. I had never talked to him until that day. He was calm,
very reassuring. I haven't talked to him since.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning, Regina Merrick watched her husband gather
the children for a swing dance class. A spelling textbook lay open
beside her. The front door closed behind them, and she sat alone in
the living room beside a machine she uses to exercise her arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``In your dreams, you still walk,'' she said. ``In your dreams,
you always walk. I long to do that again. I long to hold little
children. I long to sit in my husband's lap. I long for life not to
be so complicated. It's lonely. People who meet you assume you were
always like you are now.''
</P>
<P>
   She hesitated, staring out the window as her husband backed
their van onto the street. Her thoughts returned to Patricia Smith:
</P>
<P>
   ``It must have been something for her. I couldn't know her
pain.''

   The business mastermind behind one of the hot trends in
computing today is not Bill Gates or Michael Dell, and not some
Internet whiz kid from Silicon Valley or Seattle, but an anonymous
middle manager from Bentonville, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Robert Westmoreland of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., has been the
driving force behind the phenomenal success of computer hunting
games, led by Deer Hunter and Cabela's Big Game Hunter. It was
Westmoreland who, by all accounts, prodded the software industry to
make hunting games and then promoted them heavily at Wal-Mart, the
nation's largest retailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the man,'' observed Robert Kotick, chairman of Activision
Inc., whose Head Games unit created two best-selling Cabela games.
</P>
<P>
   The hunting game phenomenon is a sure sign that personal
computing is moving to the masses. These digital diversions are
priced below $20, less than half the cost of classic personal
computer games like Doom, Quake or Starcraft.
</P>
<P>
   The hunting games are also an early wave of what industry
analysts call casual games, easier to play and more mundane in
appearance than the special-effects-on-a-screen adventures
preferred by what the industry considers hard-core gamers _ male
techies in the 16-to-35 age range. Computer Gaming World, the bible
of computer game purists, once criticized Deer Hunter as ``boring''
and ``repetitive'' with ``lame'' graphics.
</P>
<P>
   The outdoors games _ whose audience, though still mainly male,
is often older and less technophile than the market for devout
gamers _ took off last year, as personal computers priced below
$1,000 became commonplace and the proportion of American households
with computers rose to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the 20 top-selling computer games last year were
low-cost hunting titles, according to PC Data, a research firm. And
so far this year, the latest versions of Deer Hunter and Cabela's
Big Game Hunter are high on the best-seller lists, and more sequels
are in the works. Even a spoof of hunting games, Deer Avenger, in
which deer stalk people, has recently entered the top 10 list.
</P>
<P>
   The hunting games have prompted an elitist backlash, derided as
``red neck,'' ``Bubba'' or ``trailer park'' software. Yet others
see the hunting-game phenomenon as simply a sign of the times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The computer is a personal medium, and as it is more widely
available and affordable, its use will reflect the diversity of
society,'' said Paul Saffo, a director of the Institute for the
Future, a research group in Menlo Park, Calif. ``Bubba software is
one aspect of that diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, commercial success tends to breed respect, even
if grudgingly. At the start of this year, Jeff Green, a columnist
for Computer Gaming World, conceded that the industry first made
fun of Deer Hunter, then scrambled to copy it. ``You don't have to
admire the game itself,'' he wrote, ``but you got to love anything
that makes the entire gaming industry, press included, look
stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Westmoreland, Wal-Mart's computer software buyer,
faced considerable skepticism a few years ago when he first
suggested the idea of inexpensive games for a mass market of
newcomers to personal computers. Kotick of Activision recalled a
meeting with Westmoreland in a Las Vegas hotel room during the
Comdex computer trade show in the fall of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Westmoreland's concept was sharply at odds with the
prevailing thinking and culture of the PC game business. The major
game companies regarded video games, running on the console
technology of Sony, Sega and Nintendo, as the mass-market channel.
</P>
<P>
   Personal computers, by contrast, were viewed as the preferred
technology for hard-core gamers. PC games, with multimillion-dollar
production budgets and priced in the $40 to $50 range, strove for
Hollywood-style special effects best displayed on turbocharged,
cutting-edge PC's.
</P>
<P>
   So at that 1996 meeting, Kotick listened in disbelief to
Westmoreland's suggestion. ``He described his grand vision of
under-$20 software, and I looked at him as if he had three heads,''
Kotick recalled. ``I almost walked out of the room on him. But he
was absolutely right.''
</P>
<P>
   By last June, Kotick was ready to reverse field and plunge into
the market for low-cost PC games, as Activision purchased Head
Games Publishing of Minneapolis, producer of Cabela's Big Game
Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   But Westmoreland had found a more receptive audience when he met
in Minneapolis with executives of the Wizardworks unit of GT
Interactive Software in April 1997. Seeing the large sporting goods
sections in Wal-Mart and the falling price of computers,
Westmoreland began to think that an inexpensive hunting game for
PC's could be a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You make me a deer-hunting title, and I'll get
behind it,' '' recalled Paul Rinde, a senior vice president of
Wizardworks.
</P>
<P>
   Wizardworks, based in the Midwest, was perhaps less influenced
than game developers elsewhere by the industry penchant for
Hollywood-style productions and cutting-edge computing. Like most
software publishers, Wizardworks taps a network of contractors.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1997, Rinde visited Anthony Campiti, president of
Sunstorm Interactive Inc. in Indianapolis. Sunstorm was a
six-person software developer working on PC versions of simple
games like pool and darts, and when Rinde suggested a deer hunting
game, Campiti had his doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked,'' Campiti recalled, ` ``How in the world can you make
a game about sitting in the woods for three hours, doing nothing?'
''
</P>
<P>
   But Wizardworks was offering Sunstorm a job it needed. So
Campiti, not a hunter, started researching the subject. He talked
to hunters, read hunting magazines and gained respect for the
sport. ``I learned there is a lot of skill involved in hunting,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Campiti ended up designing a simple hunting-simulation game in
which the virtual hunters can use decoy calls, cover their scent
and choose their weapons (rifle, shotgun or bow). It was called
Deer Hunter, and it proved a stunning success.
</P>
<P>
   ``In hindsight, everyone is a genius,'' Westmoreland said. ``Did
the sales of Deer Hunter surprise me? Of course. But what did not
surprise me was that there was a big market for casual gaming
software, priced below $20, waiting to be tapped.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rinde agrees that the timing is right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growing installed base of PCs and expanding demographics
have created the casual gaming market. The hunting games are just
the beginning,'' Rinde observed. ``This is PC game software for the
rest of us. People who don't care about being transported to the
year 3000 and battling aliens on the planet Zorak.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The casual game market,'' Rinde added, ``is for people who
want to do much the same things on the computer _ hunt, fish, play
cards, whatever _ that they do in real life.''
</P>
<P>
   The other lesson of the hunting game phenomenon is that as
software becomes more a mass-market product, the mass-market
retailers _ more than specialized computer stores _ may become the
vital channel of distribution. In short, Rinde said, ``Wal-Mart can
make a title, if they get behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Bubba market is not without its ironists. Wal-Mart
shoppers have also helped make the satirical ``Deer Avenger'' game
a best seller. ``There's a good-sized crossover market of Wal-Mart
customers who do have a sense of humor,'' said Brian McCann, the
game's creator and a writer on the television show ``Late Night
With Conan O'Brien.''
</P>
<P>
   But beyond mockery, McCann contends that his game is simply more
compelling to play, with its ``kill scenes'' in which a deer can
use everything from slingshots to bazookas to zap the virtual
humans. ``It's far more rewarding than watching a deer slump over
sadly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The business model in the casual game market is a world apart
from the glitzy, fantasy war-and-strategy games. Production
schedules tend to be four months instead of two years, and
production budgets generally range from $150,000 to $200,000
instead of $2 million to $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The low-cost economics are opening the door in the PC game
market for the first time in years to tiny start-ups with bootstrap
financing. One such fledgling venture is Rise Software in Rogers,
Ark. Its assets so far are story boards for a few games and hopes
of success.
</P>
<P>
   Its founder and chief executive is a 32-year-old entrepreneur
who started puttering with PC's as a 12-year-old and who may have
some useful experience and acquaintances in the industry. His name:
Robert Westmoreland, whose last day at Wal-Mart will be this
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going down the road myself, trying to capitalize on this
emerging market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He would not discuss his product ideas, except to say they would
not be hunting games.

   ... Meade, KS 67864.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't all Kobs wrote. There were stories about his
Grandpa Butler; the hard cases that once inhabited Englewood, Kan.;
and how getting roads built was no easier in 1920 than it is today.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after his retirement Kobs wrote constantly. Plus he
became a calligrapher of sorts, learning how to make the graceful,
fluid lines that go back to medieval times. He wrote wonderful
little poems, took hours copying them onto fine paper, framed them,
then sent them to friends and loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   Kobs would tell people there was no way he was going to
vegetate. No matter what his age.
</P>
<P>
   Then a year ago Kobs, age 85, stopped writing. He had a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are holes in my memory,'' he said with candor.
``Everything's been crowded back in me. Oh, I can remember a piece
here, a piece there. But I can't tie it together anymore. Not so
that I can write it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobs' wife, Ethel, says he has improved. She couldn't say if
he'll ever write again. The calligraphy definitely has become a
thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, instead of sorrow, Kobs evokes empathy. He had reached a
certain age, and the body that had served him well since William
Howard Taft was president had developed a glitch. As he said, ``You
don't see many cars my age on the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   And he has his book on George B. Allen, the mysterious old man
dressed to the nines that Eddy saw all those years ago seated
stiffly in a racing sulky pulled by a Percheron.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right after I finished the book I had two calls, one from
California, one from Washington state,'' Kobs said. ``They were
grandchildren of George B. Allen. They said I'd gotten the story
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was nice. I was happy about that.''

IMAGE MAKEOVER: THE POSTAL SERVICE GOES HOLLYWOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Postal Service knew it had an image problem.
</P>
<P>
   As Postal Service officials saw it, when most Americans thought
about the Postal Service they either pictured the character of
Newman on ``Seinfeld'' driving empty bottles to Michigan in a mail
truck in search of deposit money, or else a headline about a postal
worker getting a gun and shooting people.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the Postal Service hired Warren Weideman. An
advertising executive who had spent much of his career in ``product
placement'' _ making deals with advertisers to put their products
in scenes in Hollywood movies _ Weideman had an idea about how to
counter the Postal Service's deeply ingrained negative image.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to make movies about the exciting adventures of postal
workers, and he wanted the Postal Service to back them with a
national marketing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As to the obvious question: What exciting adventures of postal
workers? Weideman had a surprising answer: ``The most elite law
enforcement agency in the country, one nobody really knows about,
is the Postal Inspection Service. I made a deal with the Post
Office for rights to their stories.''
</P>
<P>
   The result: ``The Inspectors,'' a movie, starring the
Oscar-winner Louis Gossett Jr., which played on Showtime last
September, scoring the best ratings for any original film in that
channel's history. Weideman and the Postal Service have recently
contracted with Showtime for four more movies based on the
adventures of postal inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the culmination of Weideman's seven-year quest to
reshape the negative image of postal workers. ``It reached a point
where some guy would shoot up a K-Mart,'' he said, ``and people
would say, `He went postal.'''
</P>
<P>
   Weideman said there is a trove of true stories about postal
inspectors, who investigate letter bombs and all manner of mail
fraud. He learned that the service was Efrem Zimbalist Jr.'s first
choice for a television series in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and the producer Quinn Martin approached the Post Office,
looking to do a show about postal inspectors,'' Weideman said. ``I
saw the letter they wrote. But postal inspectors liked to be known
as the `silent service' back then. They turned them down. So
Zimbalist went across the street to the FBI.''
</P>
<P>
   Even armed with his action-packed postal inspector tales,
Weideman found pitching a movie about them a hard sell. ``Most
producers' eyes would glaze over as soon as I said the words, `post
office,' '' he said. Finally, he said, he approached Showtime from
a different angle. He said he asked what the channel thought ``of
posters for Showtime in 40,000 post offices.''
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service did even more than that. It issued 5,000
commemorative envelopes and sold them for $20 each; it put notices
about the film all over the Postal Service Web site; it put
Gossett's voice on a recording played while customers are on hold
on the phone line inside many post offices, urging them to tune
into the movie.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service did not invest in the movie itself, Weideman
said, but it put millions of dollars in advertising and marketing
behind the project to insure its success.
</P>
<P>
   Having had the success, Weideman is convinced he has stumbled
into a new business opportunity _ which is really a very old one
for television. He calls it the ``sponsored program.'' Weideman
defined it as ``finding the right property that you can associate
with a sponsor.''
</P>
<P>
   That could mean movies or programs that connect tangentially to
a product and that will encourage the makers of the product to
promote the entertainment productions, Weideman said.

   MEADE, Kan. _ The memory Eddy Kobs has of George B. Allen comes
from his youth _ seeing an impeccably dressed old man driving a
racing sulky pulled by a magnificent Percheron horse.
</P>
<P>
   Kobs, working in the fields of his family's farm, was
transfixed. Could that be (BEGIN ITALICS)the(END ITALICS) George B.
Allen, one of the earliest settlers of Meade County, large
landowner, breeder of champion racing and draft horses, autocrat of
a showplace home and farm, lawyer and sartorial dandy?
</P>
<P>
   And more, a business failure, abused husband, cuckold, derelict
father and, finally, murderer and convict.
</P>
<P>
   Kobs, then in his mid-teens, couldn't know. In those days and in
this place, George Allen's rise and fall was only whispered about.
Kobs went back to work and filed the recollection away. Soon
afterward, in 1930, Allen died.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, that picture of George B. Allen stuck with Kobs. And why
not? After all, Kobs had become a farmer, a man who spent lonely
hours in the fields. He had to have something to occupy his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Kobs was also a storyteller. Never a gossip, though _ Kobs was a
stickler for facts. He'd track them down, verify, then fold them
into his stories.
</P>
<P>
   Kobs' son, Bill, can remember the late 1930s and early 1940s:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just something he did. Back then we had one of those
6-volt battery radios, but it usually didn't work. But we didn't
care about Jack Benny or Fred Allen. We had Dad, who'd tell stories
sitting around the dinner table or afterward out on the porch. It
was just in his nature.''
</P>
<P>
   There were all sorts of stories. How Kobs was born in 1912,
survived the 1918 influenza pandemic, and reached his majority when
this part of southwest Kansas was blowing away in what appeared to
be black smoke but which really was the land turned to dust.
</P>
<P>
   Or how the Kobses came out of Lafayette County, Mo. Or, on his
mother's side, how Grandpa Hank Butler had been a cowboy on the
Texas trails, found the short-grass country here to his liking and
settled down.
</P>
<P>
   Kobs had a way of spinning a tale. He threw in the minutiae _
the sound of the ceaseless wind, how men used to roll their
cigarettes just so, and how the October calf weaning always brought
an odd hopefulness to farmers and ranchers in spite of the looming
winter.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there was always the George B. Allen story.
</P>
<P>
   Kobs farmed here for 60 years, raising hay, alfalfa and cattle.
He started with horses and mules, ended up with big tractors.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, when Kobs retired a few years ago in his late
70s, he started putting down all those old stories, first on a
notepad, then banging away at an old typewriter, and finally at a
word processor. Modernity never intimidated Kobs.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't care a whit about fiction or rose-colored
reminiscences. He liked true stories with a beginning, middle and
end.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things he did was start researching the George
B. Allen story, reading old newspapers, combing through court
records, visiting with old-timers. What emerged was a dandy.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, Kobs discovered, had come here from central Kansas in
1878, acquired several thousand acres for a song and became an
early promoter of the Angus cattle breed. He married a fine woman,
had children, and was on his way to becoming one of those
quintessential pioneer Kansas farmer//ranchers, a patriarch whose
core investment in land would withstand the vicissitudes of the
southwest Kansas agricultural economy and, even a century later,
make their heirs well-to-do men and women.
</P>
<P>
   Except Allen wanted something more than the 90-hour weeks most
Kansans knew. He decided to become a lawyer. Rather than overalls,
he wanted fine clothes. His real passion was harness racing.
</P>
<P>
   So he started reading law; sold off his land and cattle, except
for 160 acres for a horse-breeding and training operation; and
spent thousands on a Spanish-style home and barns. There was even a
racetrack on what he named the Lucern Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Allen bet he could finance his operation through the sale of
Standardbred buggy horses and Percheron draft horses, animals every
farmer needed to get to and from home and plow their fields.
</P>
<P>
   Allen bet wrong. With the new century came automobiles and
tractors. The Lucern Ranch was a loser from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Kobs, in his research, also found personal problems. Allen's
first wife died soon after childbirth. Her death was followed by
Allen's 9-year-old son and his aged father. Allen then married a
woman who from 1902 to 1911, voluminous court papers showed,
regularly beat up Allen and had ``intimate associations with house
guests.'' The couple was divorced in 1912.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, Allen's 15-year-old daughter became
involved, also intimately, with a saddle tramp named Tucker. Allen
shot young Tucker dead near Crooked Creek. He was arrested, tried,
convicted and sentenced to 10 years at Lansing, to the delight of a
crowd of a foot-stomping and hissing women who daily packed the
Meade County Courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Allen was released after four years and returned here to live
out his life quietly. He was a ruined man.
</P>
<P>
   Kobs, after all the old stories and his painstaking digging,
wrote a detailed book about Allen and his travails, with Meade
County as background. Called /{Wind Over Crooked Creek/}, it's
available ($20 postpaid) by writing to Box 191, Meade, KS 67864.

`TROPHY CAT' IS MAKING A COMEBACK

<TEXT>
<P>
   In that other life called youth, he was the ``trophy cat'' _
already great of girth, broad-jowled and intimidating, but with the
heart of a lamb.
</P>
<P>
   He came to us, shaved and stitched, from his failure as a barn
cat among more capable warriors. The other creatures of our house
took one look, recoiled, and sang their song of terror.
</P>
<P>
   Then we discovered there was no meanness in him, and he was
assigned the name Teddy to suit his gentle nature.
</P>
<P>
   That was a dozen autumns ago. He was 3 then, and having finally
found his right place in the world, he prospered. More accurately,
he (BEGIN ITALICS)inflated(END ITALICS) _ topped out at 26 pounds,
and walked with that delicate, rolling gait of people who once
displayed themselves at carnivals but now appear on daytime talk
shows instead.
</P>
<P>
   In a house of several cats, try putting one of them on a diet
sometime. You will find yourself with an interesting logistical
problem. We tried switching them all to a low-calorie ration. They
sulked and declared a fast.
</P>
<P>
   I remember once, when Teddy was in his prime, how a first-time
visitor spied him lounging on a chair and cried, in a tone of pure
wonder, ``What a (BEGIN ITALICS)beautiful(END ITALICS) white cat!''
</P>
<P>
   There's no knowing what the visitor really meant to say. But in
that instant of astonishment, ``beautiful'' was the word that came
out.
</P>
<P>
   With time's passage, the weight became gradually less. First 26
pounds; then 16. Would that age had such a beneficent effect on us
all!
</P>
<P>
   Then, more than a year ago, maybe nearer two, change of a
different kind set in. Patches of white fur were found about the
house. Pink skin began showing through. A physical showed him to be
generally sound. He had no fleas, and tests revealed no allergies.
Yet plainly he was in discomfort that could be relieved only partly
by oatmeal baths.
</P>
<P>
   He lost condition alarmingly. Every bone could be felt. The
once-robust white lion had become a fragile, half-naked thing, more
pink than white. We resigned ourselves to the prospect of losing
him, as eventually one must with these creatures whose lives are
shorter than our own.
</P>
<P>
   One morning, though, I saw him at the food bowl and he appeared
to have trouble chewing. So we changed him to a soft ration, fed in
a closed room apart from the others. He was appreciative at first,
but then rejected that, too.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another examination _ the fourth or fifth _ finally
uncovered the problem. Four abscessed teeth had caused him much
pain and had sent poison through his system. We felt a wrench of
guilt. But when, honestly, does one think to inspect a cat's mouth?
</P>
<P>
   The offending teeth were extracted, the jaw treated, and Teddy
came home with an antibiotic. Immediately, the healing set in.
</P>
<P>
   He'll never be a 26-pound trophy cat again. But his appetite's
returned, and each day he's a bit less a bag of bones. The other
morning I saw him playing with his best friend, Eric, the two of
them standing on their haunches, sparring with paws whose claws
were sheathed.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, as we were talking with a visitor in the front
hall, Teddy appeared around the corner from another room.
</P>
<P>
   His coat has begun growing back, so the worst of his shameful
nakedness is covered. But he still has a moth-eaten look that is,
to put it generously, somewhat arresting.
</P>
<P>
   ``My!'' exclaimed our visitor. ``What a beautiful white cat!''
</P>
<P>
   I could have wept to hear it. There's no knowing what she really
intended to say, but that was the word that came out.
</P>

   MONTEGO BAY, Jamaica _ As dictatorships disappear from the map
of Latin America, leaving Cuba as a holdout, violence against
reporters has dropped correspondingly, to 23 journalists killed
last year from 41 in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, as democratic institutions have taken root in
Latin America's big cities, violence against reporters has shifted
to the region's redoubt of authoritarianism, the rural areas,
according to advocates for press freedom gathered here for a
meeting of the Inter American Press Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is far more dangerous to be a reporter in a small town _
you are far more vulnerable,'' said Robert J. Cox, chairman of the
association's press freedom committee. The shift comes as reporters
in Latin America's interior increasingly try to follow the
independent reporting of their big-city colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   In Colombia, which in the last decade has recorded the highest
number of killings of journalists in the Americas, eight of the 12
reporters killed in 1998 were from small cities or rural areas,
according to the press association.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these terrorist acts come after reporters in these
little cities denounce political and administrative corruption,''
said Enrique Santos Calderon, an editor of Bogota's largest daily,
El Tiempo, and the press association's Colombian representative for
15 years. ``The new agents of violence are guerrillas and
paramilitaries. Journalists who live in zones of guerrilla or
paramilitary infiltration are completely intimidated.''
</P>
<P>
   The same pattern was noted in a report just issued by the
Committee to Protect Journalists, based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the journalists killed in 1998 were small-town or
rural-based reporters who appear to have been targeted by corrupt
local officials,'' said the Latin America section of the
committee's 1998 annual report. ``The public outcry over the murder
of prominent journalists has made it safer for those working for
major publications. But substantial risks remain for reporters who
work for less visible outlets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, how do you extend this protection to rural
areas?'' Joel Simon, the committee's Americas coordinator, asked
here.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, press defenders are adopting tactics familiar to a
big-city police chief. A rapid-reaction team of investigative
reporters is being formed to respond immediately to every report of
a murdered journalist in the Americas. To reduce impunity for these
crimes, the team will travel to crime scenes, interview police
officers and prosecutors, and conduct regular, follow-up visits,
the Inter American Press Association said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will immediately go to the country, talk to the police
chief, and then follow up one month later,'' said Alberto Ibarguen,
publisher of The Miami Herald and director of the project.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, to help focus attention on the problem, press
defense groups are expanding into interior regions of Latin
America, setting up e-mail networks and spreading information on
press rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every newsroom in the smallest newspaper in Latin America now
has e-mail communication,'' said Simon. ``Sometimes, I have gotten
information from rural Brazil, before the newspapers in Rio or Sao
Paulo.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With the spread of democracy in Latin America, repressive action
against reporters has largely shifted from government to
individuals or unofficial groups, the major exception being Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Since the start of this year, Cuban police agents have detained
and interrogated independent reporters on 25 occasions, a sharp
increase, according to the press association. Currently, six Cuban
reporters are in jail. Two more, Jose Edel Garcia Diaz and Jesus
Diaz Loyola, were last seen in Havana on Feb. 25 and are listed in
the report as ``disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   Press advocates attribute this to government nervousness about
the worsening economy and President Fidel Castro's discomfort with
a new breed of independent reporters who are supplying reports to
news organizations outside Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10-year period that ended in November, the press
association said, Cuba recorded the highest number of local
journalists forced into exile, 21, and the highest number of
foreign journalists barred entry, 105. In the category of
expulsions of foreign journalists, Cuba was second, with 17, after
Panama with 18.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the Committee to Protect Journalists, put Castro as
the only national leader in the Americas on its list of ``Enemies
of the press: the 10 worst offenders of 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite implicit promises to Pope John Paul II that there
would be greater room for freedom of expression, Castro continues
his control over all media outlets and his harsh treatment of
independent journalists, who are routinely detained, arrested, and
beaten, or forced into exile,'' wrote Simon.
</P>
<P>
   Noting a new press law intended to intimidate independent Cuban
journalists, he added, ``A serious deterioration of press freedom
in Cuba has taken place.''

ONE MS PATIENT CHOSE SUICIDE; ONE WANTS LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 MALCOLM GARCIA  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Regina Merrick never knew Patricia Smith, but
their paths seemed destined to cross.
</P>
<P>
   Like Merrick, Smith was a nurse, a mother and an active member
of the Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   She also had the same debilitating form of multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 22, 1996, Smith, of Lee's Summit, decided to end her
pain with the aid of suicide doctor Jack Kevorkian. She was 40
years old and left behind a husband and their 17-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Her death haunted Merrick, now 45, who read newspaper articles
and watched television reports about Smith's suicide in Pontiac,
Mich.
</P>
<P>
   She tried to contact Smith's family. She talked to counselors at
the Multiple Sclerosis Society. She hoped to run into Smith's
friends or family.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as Kevorkian went on trial and was convicted of
second-degree murder, Merrick's thoughts turned to Smith again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to know what went through her mind,'' Merrick
recalled from her Kansas City, Mo. home. ``My MS was at the same
stage as hers was two years ago. Finally, I had to leave it alone.
It's worth it for me to live.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't for Smith.
</P>
<P>
   When it was clear Smith's condition would continue to decline,
she decided to see Kevorkian, said her husband, David Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was strong-willed, determined,'' he said. ``She was
extroverted, compassionate and the most unselfish person I know.
She was a fighter, but even a fighter has to stop after a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrick was diagnosed with MS in 1979. Her doctors expected her
to live a mostly normal life. They said she could have a family. An
avid skier and cyclist, she carried on with a slight limp. She had
six children and taught them at home.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1991 she started walking ``as if I was drunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later she couldn't walk at all.
</P>
<P>
   The chronic-progressive multiple sclerosis that is gradually
breaking down Merrick's body is the most debilitating form of the
disease. It is the same strain of MS that tormented Patricia Smith.
It affects 15 percent of all MS patients, according to the
Mid-America chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.
</P>
<P>
   Merrick has limited use of her arms but can get around in a
battery-powered wheelchair. Smith, on the other hand, was
bedridden.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very thought-provoking,'' Merrick said of Smith's
suicide. ``If assisted suicide gets legalized, for someone like me,
who is no longer a contributing member of society _ I mean, it
costs for me to stick around _ then what's going to happen to me?
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband dresses me. All my personal care has to be managed
by someone. It is so devastating when you can't handle that
anymore. You don't know what will happen. The last three or four
years have been much more difficult. When I could no longer do
anything, it took a little reckoning.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrick and her family live on the campus of Midwestern Baptist
Theological Seminary, where her husband, Bruce, teaches. Members of
the seminary's Faculty Wives Club assist the family. Once a month
they prepare an assortment of stews, lasagna and casseroles. The
meals are labeled and stored in the freezer for future use.
</P>
<P>
   Merrick sees her doctor at least once a month. She has
prescriptions for anti-depressants, and has urinary tract
infections and a host of other physical ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the frame on her wheelchair broke. Although the chair
carries a warranty, the manufacturer is charging $600 for labor.
</P>
<P>
   The frustration is just one of many for the Merricks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a struggle, especially if I have morning classes,'' Bruce
Merrick said. ``I've got to get me up and her up, and if I don't,
there's stress. You have to look at the reality of the
deterioration. She's losing ground day by day, changing day by
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Five months before her death, Patricia Smith could no longer
accept the deterioration of her body. She had tried everything: bee
venom therapy 20 to 30 times a day, a quack doctor in Florida who
promised a cure, and New Age healing that called for suspending
metal balls around the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inclination is to hang on,'' David Smith said. ``You
really grasp for just about anything when modern medicine doesn't
work.''

DESPARATE TIMES TEST DESPOT'S SURVIVAL SKILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 RICK MONTGOMERY AND SCOTT CANON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic wears fine suits and puffs
pricey Cuban cigars in a region where only half the people hold
steady jobs. He seldom smiles and rarely speaks in public. And, if
recent opinion polls mean anything, popularity eludes him, even in
his own country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slobo,'' the enigma. The opportunist. Serb protector,
political schemer, wily survivor. ``The Butcher of the Balkans.''
</P>
<P>
   The old labels to describe Milosevic provide convenient
shorthand for Americans who, until last week, had mostly ignored
this latest international villain.
</P>
<P>
   Like other despots, he is said to ``thrive on chaos,'' although
he lacks the bluster of Saddam Hussein or the fevered charisma of
Adolf Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   He has long denied supporting a policy of ethnic cleansing. He
has never been indicted for genocide. But the United States
contends his hands are stained by the blood of hundreds of
thousands of Bosnians, and now thousands of ethnic Albanians. In
those same hands rests the fate of a torn and troubled Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He creates disorder and manages to convince people only he can
resolve it,'' wrote biographer Slavoljub Djukic. ``He is both the
pyromaniac and the fireman.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO last week launched its first offensive on a sovereign state
after Milosevic refused to accept peace terms that would have
restored some self-rule to the southern province of Kosovo, where
90 percent of the population is ethnic Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   Observers say NATO allies hope the bombing of Yugoslavia, where
Milosevic's support has long been eroding, will spur his war-weary
people to finally bring down the 57-year-old Serb leader.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility, however, is that the U.S.-sponsored air
attacks will lend credence to an anti-West resentment that prevails
across much of Yugoslavia, largely through news media controlled by
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone knows how to calculate securing the first
possibility'' _ an overthrow of Milosevic _ ``and not getting the
second'' _ strengthening his position, said Kurt Bassuener of the
Washington-based Balkan Action Council, which opposes Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   A banker-turned-communist bureaucrat who then turned Serbian
nationalist, Milosevic rose to prominence in 1987, when he
back-stabbed some of his communist allies and staged a coup to
become Serbian Communist Party president. Two years later, as
communism collapsed across Europe, he waved the banner of Serb
nationalism to prevail in Yugoslavia's first democratic elections
since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The new president of Serbia used his power to abolish the
autonomy of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   When Milosevic's second term expired in 1997 _ amid economic
instability and street protests over his policies _ he tapped
friendly factions in the Parliament to become president of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, Milosevic's approval ratings there have
rarely climbed above 30 percent. His country's economy once was as
advanced and vibrant as any in eastern Europe. But in the past
decade it has staggered backward, hampered by international
sanctions, to the brink of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, experts say, Milosevic has managed to maintain
power by controlling ruthless police and military forces, by
fanning Serbian fears of victimization, and by pointing to Kosovo
as the rightful domain of Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he's always believed his own nationalistic rhetoric is
debatable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slobodan Milosevic certainly did capitalize on the nationalist
card in terms of his rise to power in Serbia,'' said Robin
Remington, a University of Missouri-Columbia political scientist
who has studied Yugoslavia and has done research there. ``He
started out as a perfectly faithful communist.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is the son of a Serbian Orthodox priest and a
schoolteacher. His father shot himself in 1962; his mother hanged
herself in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Milosevic, a Communist Party bureaucrat, seemed an
unlikely ringleader for Serb nationalism. Observers often cite his
visit to Kosovo that year as the moment that transformed him into a
champion of Serb interests throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   History made Kosovo the perfect stage. It was there on June 15,
1389, on the ``field of the blackbirds'' that Serb forces fell to
the Turks of the Ottoman Empire. As the sun set, Serbian King Lazar
was beheaded and his people were cast into 500 years of oppression.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, during his 1987 visit, represented the federal
government in talks with the Albanian Kosovars. Local Serbs
demonstrated outside his meeting, yelling, ``Save us, save us,'' as
police pushed them back.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic emerged and commanded, ``No one shall beat the
people.'' He had their hearts in an instant.

   Computer Users Prepare For Spread of E-Mail Virus
</P>
<P>
   With tens of thousands of computers already thought to be
infected, corporations and network security professionals said that
they were bracing for the continued spread of the ``Melissa''
computer virus this week.
</P>
<P>
   The virus, which is carried by e-mail, appears to be one of the
fastest replicating viruses ever detected because it automatically
tries to mail itself from each recipient's machine to 50 other
e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Products Put in Shows by Computer
</P>
<P>
   Another frontier in the commercialization of culture was crossed
earlier this month when computer-generated images of four products
appeared briefly in scenes on the UPN series ``Seven Days.'' The
images were inserted into the episode after it was completed by the
producer through a process that seeks to create images
indistinguishable from actual objects.
</P>
<P>
   Reshaping Image of Post Office
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to reshape the image of postal workers, an advertising
executive hired by the Postal Service came up with an idea for a
movie about the Postal Inspection Service. The result was ``The
Inspectors,'' starring the Oscar-winner Louis Gossett Jr., which
played on Showtime last September. Four more movies based on the
postal inspectors are planned for Showtime.
</P>

   Devices to Store TV Shows Digitally

   Xerox to Buy French Company
</P>
<P>
   Xerox announced that it was buying SET Electronique, a French
company that makes continuous-feed printers that can produce 500
pages a minute and can accept data that are compatible with
printers made by IBM and Oce. With SET, Xerox can take on those two
giants in the market for printers that accept data from desktop
computers and turn large rolls of paper into sheets like bills and

   Latin America Safer for Reporters
</P>
<P>
   Violence against reporters in Latin America has declined, to 23
journalists killed last year from 41 in 1989, and appears to have
shifted from big cities to rural areas, according to advocates for
press freedom.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO bombers pummel Yugoslavia, President Slobodan Milosevic
has shut down virtually all the independent newspapers and
silencing the nation's most prominent independent radio station.
</P>
<P>
   Counting on a Volume Business
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of companies are trying to capitalize on the promise
of conducting commerce and serving customers on the Internet. But
many Internet-only businesses are built on the strategy that
whatever millions of dollars they lose today, they will later make
up in volume. A growing number of industry watchers and executives
have begun to question how a volume-driven Internet can survive,
let alone grow, when its native businesses cannot turn a profit.

   How much is a good Rolodex worth?
</P>
<P>
   In the case of J.D. LaRock, the recently hired education
reporter for the all-news cable channel NY1, it did not hurt that
he spent the last 18 months as a press officer for the New York
City Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   LaRock, 25, was hired by the cable news channel earlier this
month over several other candidates, most of them seasoned
reporters. NY1 said it chose LaRock even though he did not have any
prior journalism experience because of his familiarity with the
city's notoriously Byzantine school system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted someone who could walk right in,'' said Steve
Paulus, the station's general manager. ``We feel like reporting
techniques are something we can teach him.''
</P>
<P>
   But some in the news business wondered whether LaRock would pull
his punches. ``I would say it raises serious conflict of interest
issues,'' said Sandy Padwe, an associate dean at the Columbia
School of Journalism. ``How do you stay fair when you have to
report on the same venue you just came from?''
</P>
<P>
   Some of LaRock's new colleagues found it unnerving two weeks ago
when he showed up at a board news conference as a reporter, his
hair newly blown out for broadcast consumption. Only days earlier,
LaRock had been taking questions from the same journalists, and
some worried that his insider status would give him an unfair edge.
</P>
<P>
   His former employers, however, said they did not find his new
career troubling. ``We certainly have no problem with it here,''
said Chiara Coletti, a spokeswoman for the chancellor. ``There's so
much jumping back and forth these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Although officials with the city's Conflict of Interest Board
had no comment on LaRock's case, the board's deputy counsel, Wayne
Hawley, explained that unless former public employees use
confidential information for private advantage, the city charter
does not bar them from using their expertise in a new position.
``You don't have to get a lobotomy when you leave government,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As an alumni of the city's public school system _ and the son of
two current Board of Education employees _ LaRock says he is
well-suited for his new profession. ``I don't see my old job and
new job as adversarial,'' he said. ``A press officer is ultimately
responsible to the public and the press serves the same master.
</P>
<P>
   ``And besides,'' he added, ``I was never privy to a lot of
sensitive information.''

   A Magazine Checks Up on Its Investigators &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It may not be in a magazine publisher's best interest to anger a
man with close ties to Salvatore Gravano, the mob hit man who
worked for John Gotti. But John F. Kennedy Jr., the publisher and
editor in chief of George, and Richard Blow, its executive editor,
have certainly annoyed Peter Maas, the author of ``Underboss: Sammy
the Bull Gravano's Story of Life in the Mafia'' by holding up an
article for more than eight months.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of the magazine's editors, Maas and Mike
Barnicle, the columnist who resigned from The Boston Globe last
summer amid charges of sloppy journalism, wrote an article for
George a year ago titled ``The Brothers Bulger.''
</P>
<P>
   Maas and Barnicle filed the article _ which appeared this month
and focused on William M. Bulger, the president of the University
of Massachusetts, and his brother, the reputed Boston mobster James
J. (Whitey) Bulger _ in early June 1998. Then, in late June, the
scandal erupted around Barnicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were raving about the piece,'' Maas said. ``Then Mike got
into trouble, and they really panicked. So they held it until this
month, eight months later.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Blow, the Barnicle scandal led the magazine to
believe that ``it was worthwhile to take as much time as necessary
to make sure that everything in the article checked out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, he said, ``Mike Barnicle's ethical problems presented
an easy avenue of critique for anyone who didn't like the story.''
</P>
<P>
   And he added that additional fact-checking and legal supervision
were necessary because ``both Peter Maas and Mike Barnicle are
journalists who have been involved in journalistic controversies.''
(Blow was referring to a lawsuit against Maas in 1997 that accused
him of wrongly sharing profits from ``Underboss'' with Gravano.)
</P>
<P>
   Maas said that he was not aware that any extensive fact-checking
had taken place. Barnicle did not return telephone calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The two, meanwhile, have put George behind them. This month,
Barnicle begins contributing to The Daily News as a Sunday
columnist. And they sold the rights to the George article to Robert
Redford's entertainment company, Wildwood Enterprises. Redford,
Maas said, is interested in playing one of the Bulger brothers. &QL;

   At Knight Ridder, The Chief Belies Tightfisted Image &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to being tight with company money, few newspaper
executives can match P. Anthony Ridder, the chief executive of
Knight Ridder, the country's second-largest newspaper chain. For
his relentless cost-cutting, he is known as ``Darth Ridder,'' a
nickname he has joked about while demanding 20 percent profit
margins.
</P>
<P>
   But no expense was spared last year when Ridder moved the
company's headquarters to San Jose, Calif., from Miami, the
company's proxy statement showed.
</P>
<P>
   The company paid moving expenses for about 40 of its 150
headquarters staff. The 40 also got bonuses to compensate for the
higher price of housing in Silicon Valley, a deal that two
compensation consultants who work for companies and corporate
boards say was appropriate for lower-level workers, but not for
Ridder.
</P>
<P>
   Ridder received a $300,000 ``relocation bonus'' for moving to
San Jose, where he had lived for most of his adult life before a
promotion brought him to Miami in 1986. He also got $274,163 to pay
income taxes on the bonus, plus ``incidental relocation expense
allowances of $25,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Less senior employees got a year's salary with a minimum of
$70,000, plus taxes, and part of the incidentals money.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Ann Schlatter, a Knight Ridder spokeswoman, said the bonuses
``were paid so people would make the move.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jean Connors, senior vice president for human resources,
said relocation consultants estimated that housing would cost 2.5
times as much in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The compensation consultants said Ridder should not have taken
the housing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Foley, a compensation lawyer in White Plains, N.Y., called
the payments ``an extra helping'' at a table where Ridder is
telling everyone under him not to take too much because money is
tight. ``It looks like a $600,000 handout,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Johnson, an executive compensation consultant in New York,
said: ``It's a high price and terrible optics. This is a national
corporation with national-level pay for senior executives, so the
higher housing price argument doesn't hold. And if it's on top of
actual moving expenses, then it is outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to moving expenses and the relocation bonus, Ridder
was paid $810,000 in salary last year. He also received a $415,242
bonus and 80,000 stock options that the company's board valued at
$926,400 on the day they were granted. He made $2.1 million
exercising options and holds options worth about $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Connors agreed that Ridder was paid on a national scale, but
she said that he was included in the relocation bonus ``because we
didn't want to discriminate against Tony.''

A TRICKY PATH FOR AN AMBITIOUS SERIES
</HEADLINE>
   (See also: CENTURY-TV-REVIEW, CENTURY-TV-LIST)

 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After what only seems like 100 years of journalistic labors,
ABC's 12-hour documentary project ``The Century'' will finally
begin broadcasting Monday night after one of the longest, most
expensive and most convoluted odysseys of any single project in
television history.
</P>
<P>
   It began in 1990, when ABC was a part of Capital Cities Inc.,
and ended with ABC owned by the Walt Disney Co. It went from a $10
million budget in the early stages to about $25 million in the end.
</P>
<P>
   It went through at least three different narrative approaches,
three executive producers and various attempts to kill it, and it
was entirely reimagined starting last August after David Westin
took over as ABC News president and hired Shelby Coffey as his top
deputy. All the people interviewed about their memories of World
War I have died.
</P>
<P>
   The project hits the air with the unexpected momentum provided
by the success of the best-selling book ``The Century''
(Doubleday), by Peter Jennings and Todd Brewster, which grew out of
the research for the project. And Jennings, the series' anchor,
says television viewers are interested in what is on the screen,
not what it took to get it there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Name me a news organization that doesn't have some degree of
turmoil on a major project,'' he said. ``What people care about in
The New York Times is what gets in the paper. It's the same with
us. There are people out there who think their job is to set the
bar for us, but the bar for me is set by the audience, and I think
there is a real hunger out there from everyone I encounter to
relive and experience and learn from what's gone on over the last
100 years.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the project will indeed rise or fall on what viewers see
on their screens, it has also been a cautionary saga about the
difficulties of doing ambitious projects amid the shifting winds of
changing corporate ownership, programming and news trends and cable
competition in television.
</P>
<P>
   And its debut Monday night, in an inauspicious time slot against
the NCAA basketball championship game, is a far cry from the
grandiose hopes with which the project began.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Century,'' which will be broadcast Monday night and five
other nights through April 10, is the result of a prodigious
journalistic effort. Reporters interviewed more than 500 witnesses
to the century's most important events, studied more than 3,000
hours of news film and ended up with a project that will include
the book, the ABC News documentary, a 15{-hour documentary that
will be shown on the History Channel, a Web site at thecentury.com
and efforts at spreading the research to teachers and schools.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way the project lurched along like television's
version of the 30 Years' War. Early plans envisioned partners like
the United Nations and Russian and British broadcasting and a
26-hour extravaganza marketed like the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The partnerships fell through, and the research moved along with
either corporate hostility or indifference for years. The original
producer, Lionel Chapman, helped dig up rare film and began with a
chronological approach. Amid waning corporate support, he was
removed as head of the project and relegated to the less
prestigious cable project. He died of a heart attack five months
later, in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   He was replaced by Av Westin, a producer with a long history at
CBS and ABC. Westin retooled the entire project, replacing the
chronological approach with a thematic one, basing each episode on
a theme like war or technology or American music. Then, with only
eight months to go before the first broadcast, he, too, was
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems you have on television _ you may have it
in print as well _ is you don't really focus until you get close to
deadline, which is where I came in,'' said David Westin, who is no
relation to Av Westin. ``The thematic idea sounded good on paper,
but it was hard to do without being somewhat dry and abstract and a
little bit like a textbook.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Yellin, a longtime collaborator with Jennings on
investigative and documentary projects, was brought in, and the
focus changed once more. Covering the whole century was never an
option.
</P>
<P>
   But after a meeting in August with Yellin, David Westin, Coffey
and Phyllis McGrady, executive producer of special programming, and
with the concurrence of Jennings, who was on vacation at the time,
the approach shifted toward a more story-based narrative. The goal
became telling evocative stories that together illuminated many of
the important themes of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a difference between storytelling and an essay about a
theme,'' Yellin said. ``We think the first is much better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Elvis segment is not just about Elvis. It's about
producing change in popular culture, the youth revolution, how
culture is spread around the world. It's a story about profound
social change, but if you began with the idea of doing a story on
profound social change, it wouldn't work. Tell a good story and it
will.''

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Monday night's program is called ``Heaven and Earth'' and
includes Charles Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic and the
exploration of space leading to Neil Armstrong's first step on the
moon.
</P>
<P>
   The second, ``Ultimate Power,'' includes the rise and fall of
Hitler and the race to build an atomic bomb. The third, ``No Man's
Land,'' focuses on World War I and Vietnam. Other topics include
Martin Luther King Jr. and civil rights; the Depression and the New
Deal; the Cold War and the myth-making powers of Hollywood; the
Iran hostage crisis and the role of television, and a final program
of analysis and perspective.
</P>
<P>
   With its scale, the project will no doubt be critiqued on
various levels. It is, for example, the century through very much
an American lens, omitting topics as profound as the end of
colonialism in Africa and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings and Yellin said that given the program's audience, the
role played by the United States and the scope of the project from
the World Wars in Europe to Vietnam to the crisis in Iran, the
American perspective was unavoidable and the project was far more
than just America's experience.
</P>
<P>
   And David Westin and Yellin agreed that the project could have
used a few more months to fully realize the new approach. But
Yellin said that the shifts in regimes did not have a huge impact
on the project. What did change from 1990, he said, was the
development of a whole new cable universe with avenues like the
History Channel able to present history and documentaries on a
scale that had never been done before.
</P>
<P>
   That evolution, the proliferation of news magazine programs and
the range of alternatives to the networks made an approach that
might have made sense in 1990 inadequate in 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bar is just so much higher,'' Yellin said. ``You can't do
a pretty good job and think that's OK. So this has been an odyssey,
but I think it would be a mistake to focus too much on the odyssey.
There were many opportunities for ABC to have walked away from
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in the end it wasn't cynical or mercenary or ratings
factors that kept it alive, but a sense of obligation in the best
sense. Since I've been involved, there's been no desire to see this
be anything other than the best it can be. We want to be judged on
the results we put on the air, and we feel we've given it our best
shot.''

<P>
   BUDAPEST, Hungary _ Warning that NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia
had severely damaged Russia's relationship with the United States,
a Russian delegation met here Sunday with the U.S. special envoy,
Richard Holbrooke, before attempting to travel by road to
neighboring Yugoslavia to present a peace plan to President
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Three prominent liberal politicians from Moscow, who said that
their mission had been approved by Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
said their primary goal was to stop NATO air attacks against
Yugoslavia. They also said the Clinton administration made a
serious miscalculation by expecting that bombs would bring
Milosevic to the negotiating table over Kosovo and by failing to
understand how the bombing would inflame anti-American feelings in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the continuation of the fighting and bombing in
Yugoslavia is extremely dangerous for the world. If the situation
continues in the direction it is going now, we are confronted with
a serious danger of the Cold War re-emerging,'' said Yegor Gaidar,
a member of the delegation and acting prime minister in 1992 after
he helped launch the shock therapy reforms of the Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
   Gaidar and other members of the delegation said that they had
several specific peace proposals to present to Milosevic, but that
they would not disclose them until after they met with the Yugoslav
leader.
</P>
<P>
   However, Milosevic's response to previous mediation efforts
suggested that the Russians' chances for affecting the course of
the war were slim.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Milosevic met with a Ukrainian delegation led by
Foreign Minister Boris Barasyuk, which, like the Russians, had
traveled to Belgrade in an effort to mediate an end to the
conflict. There was no indication that they had met with any
success.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, an official at the Yugoslav foreign ministry said
efforts were being made to set up a meeting for the Russians, but
had no other details. The Russian group was reported to have
reached the Yugoslav capital this evening.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting here with the Russians, Holbrooke, who is in
Budapest on private business, said that while he wished the peace
delegation well, he wanted to make clear that the Moscow group
would not be carrying a message from the United States to
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reviewed the American position,'' said Holbrooke, who
failed last week in talks with Milosevic aimed at persuading him to
accept a plan for peace in Kosovo. ``There is no change in that
position in the sense there is a clear disagreement between the
Russian government and NATO, but that does not mean we cannot still
continue close contacts.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Western diplomat said after the meeting that the
Russian delegation was extremely unlikely to make any headway with
Milosevic and that its presence in Belgrade would have no effect on
NATO's bombing campaign. But the diplomat said that the mission
represents ``a genuine desire'' on the part of Western-minded
reformers in Russia to limit, and, if possible, reverse a marked
deterioration in American-Russian relations since the bombing began
last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Members of some NATO governments Sunday suggested that the
Russian government itself could be useful in negotiating with
Milosevic to stop armed attacks by Serbian forces in Kosovo against
ethnic Albanians and bring an end to the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   French President Jacques Chirac has urged Russian Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov to go to Belgrade to ask Milosevic to end the
crisis, French officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit called on Yeltsin to help
find a political solution to the conflict. ``I think an
intervention by Mr. Yeltsin to persuade Serbia to a more reasonable
position would be most useful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dutch Foreign Minister Jozias van Aartsen also said that the
Russians have a key role to play in resolving the conflict over
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview here, Boris Nemtsov, a former Russian deputy
prime minister, said that the bombing of Serbia was an ``enormous
miscalculation'' that has infuriated an overwhelming majority of
Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Nemtsov said the bombing, if it continues, could provoke a
powerful anti-American political movement that would severely
weaken the influence of pro-Western reformers in Russia. He made
his remarks before hearing word of shots being fired Sunday in
Moscow at the American Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Milosevic,'' said Nemtsov. ``I know that bombing is not
going to make him change his mind. It has made him a hero to the
Serbian people. The United States made a big mistake.''

   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ With conditions in Kosovo worsening daily,
relief workers on Sunday expressed increasing anxiety about the
fate of the hundreds of thousands of displaced ethnic Albanians cut
off from food supplies by the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all relief organizations, which numbered more than 30
before NATO started air strikes last week, have abandoned their
Kosovo operations, which provided food and supplies to more than
200,000 ethnic Albanians who have left their homes over the past
year of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials report more than 500,000 ethnic Albanians _ 25
percent of Kosovo's population _ have been driven from their homes.
There was no way to independently verify any of the information
coming from Kosovo, however, since foreign journalists have not
been allowed into the province.
</P>
<P>
   The civilian population has been caught in the middle of a
brutal struggle between Serb forces and guerillas seeking Kosovo's
independence from Serbia, one of two states that make up
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks leading up to the air strikes, aid groups
distributed substantial stocks of food and supplies to the
Albanians who have been living in war-damaged houses, camps and
other makeshift shelters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We estimate that there are one to two weeks of food per family
(remaining),'' said Jason Miko, the spokesman for Mercy Corps
International, one of the largest relief groups operating in
Kosovo. ``But we're not sure whether that will hold because the new
fighting has displaced even more people . . . placing even more
demand on the stored commodities.''
</P>
<P>
   If the fighting continues, food stores may begin to run out by
midweek for the displaced ethnic Albanians, many of whom are in
remote locations, he said. There are no plans to resume
distribution until the NATO attacks end.
</P>
<P>
   Relief workers still in Kosovo have pleaded for air drops of
supplies, but it is unclear whether this would help. ``They are so
frightened, I doubt they'd come out into the open to get the
supplies if they were dropped,'' Miko said.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions in Kosovo were routinely described by diplomats and
aid workers Sunday as chaotic.
</P>
<P>
   There were multiple unconfirmed reports of Serb forces killing
civilians. There also were reports that Serb forces were emptying
villages of ethnic Albanians and forcing them to march to the
border.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the group of international observers forced to
leave Kosovo before the air strikes said that contacts who remain
in the province paint a dire picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ethnic cleansing -- you cannot describe it in any other
way,'' said Sandy Bayth, a spokesman for the Organization of
Security and Cooperation in Europe. ``The Serbs are simply going
into areas and systematically cleansing whole towns and villages.''
</P>
<P>
   Pristina, Kosovo's provincial capital, is in near anarchy, said
aid workers who remained in the city and were interviewed by
telephone. ``Shops, restaurants and offices have been burned and
looted,'' said one aid worker who spoke to Cox Newspapers from a
Pristina residence on condition of anonymity for fear of her life.
``We have electricity only a little, so we do not get much
information from the outside world. Most people -- particularly
those who the Serbs associate with Westerners, the media or relief
agencies -- stay in their homes and pray that the soldiers don't
come.''
</P>
<P>
   Aid groups have lost most contact with their staffs in Pristina.
Phone service has been sporadic. Most relief groups have relocated
here to Skopje.
</P>
<P>
   Serb forces have burned the huge Mother Theresa Warehouse on the
outskirts of Pristina, a primary distribution point for the aid
groups, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns also are mounting over pressures caused by the exodus
of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo into the neighboring Balkan states
of Albania and Macedonia, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of refugees have streamed into Albania since the start
of the airstrikes, officials said. The U.N. High Commissioner on
Refugees said it expected that up to 15,000 refugees would arrive
in Albania by the end of the day Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Albania is a desperately poor country straining to cope with the
more than 30,000 refugees already in the country. Albanian
officials on Sunday implored Western powers to provide additional
aid to assist in dealing with the influx.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In Macedonia, a frail new democracy that rests on a delicate
harmony between ethnic groups, officials worried that a large
influx of Kosovar Albanians could threaten the balance. The
Macedonia government has registered 16,000 refugees, but many
officials believe the number may be much higher because not all
ethnic Albanians are registering with authorities. The poor country
has committed $40 million -- about 5 percent of the country's
national budget -- to provide for the refugees. Another $15 million
in assistance has been provided in foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   Some Macedonia officials have expressed concerns that the
growing ranks of unemployed Macedonians may begin to resent the
government assistance to Albanians from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia officials also are anxious about potential reprisals
from Serbs for its association with NATO. Macedonia on Sunday
petitioned NATO for immediate emergency membership and the
alliance's full military protection.
</P>
<P>
   The country already hosts 10,000 NATO peacekeeping troops. These
troops would make up the first wave of a 28,000-man force that
would move into Kosovo if Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, president
of Yugoslavia, submits to Western demands to allow the NATO troops
to enter Kosovo to police a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Western diplomat on Sunday said the Macedonians have
been expressing concerns about what the neighboring Serbs may do
when NATO forces pull out after the Kosovo crisis passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are concerns that the Serbs -- who have long memories --
will always be there,'' the diplomat said, on condition of
anonymity. ``They have reason to be worried about Serb behavior.
When you're a country of 2.2 million, Serbia is the proverbial
300-pound gorilla.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO is reviewing the request for emergency membership, said the
diplomat, who says that Macedonia has been given informal
assurances that it would not be abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're stressing to them that if they stick with us, we'll
stick with them.''

   Your newsstand is overflowing.
</P>
<P>
   It's stacked to the rafters with People, Teen People and People
en Espanol. There's Country Living and Country Living Country
Gardener and Country Living Healthy Living.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget Traditional Home and Traditional Home Decorator
Showhouse and Traditional Home Renovation Style.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, publishers have come to see the spinoff
as the future of magazines. Spinoffs are new magazines that take
the title of the original publication and, by adding a subtitle
like ``For women,'' ``Finance'' or ``Gardener,'' attempt to attract
new readership and provide a new marketplace for advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly endless iterations are only accelerating. This
week, Sports Illustrated for Women, the brainchild of Time Warner's
Sports Illustrated publishing staff, will join its firstborn
sibling, Sports Illustrated for Kids, on the newsstand. And they,
in turn, will be joined at the same time by the National Geographic
Society's National Geographic Adventure, the offspring of National
Geographic.
</P>
<P>
   Even Conde Nast, previously reluctant to risk diluting any of
its brand names, has thrown its hat into the ring. The unit of
Advance Publications announced last week that in partnership with
Ideas Publishing Group, a Miami company, it would publish Vogue en
Espanol.
</P>
<P>
   The pace is picking up faster than you can say ``Sports
Illustrated for Teen People en Espanol.'' And with the barrage of
new entries, the problems with spinoffs are beginning to show
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Skepticism from the advertising industry toward magazines deemed
to be stretching the brand name can result in a disappointing
number of ad pages. Cost-conscious publishers tend to load up _ and
annoy _ primary editorial staffs with the responsibilities of
producing a second, or even third, magazine. Consumers and
newsstand dealers get confused if logos are not different enough.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, they just plain fail, even with the power of a
great brand _ like Meredith Corp.'s Better Homes and Gardens or
even The Christian Science Monitor _ behind them.
</P>
<P>
   The Magazine Publishers of America keeps no records of how many
magazines a year are spinoffs, but Dr. Samir Husni, a professor of
journalism at the University of Mississippi who tracks magazine
startups, estimated that 20 percent of new magazines in 1998 were
spun off existing publications, compared with just 5 percent five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a magazine market of falling newsstand sales _ two-thirds of
all magazines reported declining newsstand sales in the second half
of 1998, according to Capell's Circulation Report _ one of the
primary advantages of a spinoff is that it appears to be risk-free;
a publisher can say it is merely testing an offspring publication
as a one-shot or a special-interest publication.
</P>
<P>
   If readers respond to the newsstand product, the publishers will
spin off the title officially _ as Rodale Press did with
Prevention's Guide to Men's Health, a one-shot magazine that became
the robustly successful Men's Health _ and announce a victory. If
the magazine does not find a sustainable market, the publisher can
explain it away as a special-interest publication that it does not
intend to revive, and still pocket the one-time revenue.
</P>
<P>
   On the marketing level, spinning off a new title takes advantage
of a company's existing brand. On an economic level, the cost is
usually minimal around start-up time because one editorial staff is
doing the work of two magazines.
</P>
<P>
   And from the psychological-developmental level, publishers see
spinoffs as incubators for future readers. The president of Hearst
Magazines, Cathleen Black, sees a junior version of Cosmopolitan _
aimed at girls, due on newsstands this fall _ as a way ``to
graduate them up to the big sister publication when they're
older.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Wall, the publisher of Newsweek magazine, said that Teen
Newsweek _ which will be sent to schools and subscribers in
September _ is a way to ``build a media habit among young readers.
'' Earlier this month, The New York Times and Scholastic Inc.
announced that they would publish a news magazine for teen-agers,
to be called The New York Times Upfront.
</P>
<P>
   And on a practical level, slipping a spinoff onto the newsstands
is easier than sneaking into a multiplex matinee on Sunday.
Magazine publishers do not have to approach and sell newsstand
distributors on the new concept or negotiate new contracts for the
newsstand space, said Daniel Capell, an authority on magazine
circulation and the editor of Capell's Circulation Report.
</P>
<P>
   But the editor in chief of American Express Publishing's Travel
&AMP; Leisure, Nancy Novgorod, pointed out that sometimes newsstand
dealers get confused about which title is which.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big concern,'' she said, adding that she recently saw
that a newsstand dealer in Dulles Airport in Washington had
confused her magazines, and only displayed copies of Travel &AMP;
Leisure Golf, not Travel &AMP; Leisure.
</P>
<P>
   And she said that the company was bound by postal restrictions
not to make the cover of Travel &AMP; Leisure Family markedly different
from Travel &AMP; Leisure, so that it could avoid extra fees that would
be charged if it were a separate magazine. ``And when that magazine
goes on the newsstand, people get confused,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all spinoffs survive. Times Mirror Magazines spun Popular
Science magazine off into Popular Science for Kids in 1995, which
lasted for five issues; The Christian Science Monitor introduced
World Monitor magazine, which folded after three years when the
company decided to invest in other areas of the media, despite
reaching a monthly circulation of 300,000 readers. Better Homes and
Gardens Home Garden magazine, a 1995 spinoff of Better Homes and
Gardens, hung around for eight issues.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And the theoretical convenience of spinning off can be eclipsed
by practical matters like financing, staffing, advertising and
plain old editorial hey-that-was-my-idea-first adversity.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Outside Magazine, the owner Larry Burke _ the
chief executive of Mariah Media Inc. _ chose to spin off Women
Outside when he saw that according to Mediamark Research Inc., a
company that charts reader demographics, Outside was attracting
large numbers of women readers who would pick up the magazine after
their male friends or spouses had already read it.
</P>
<P>
   But in his enthusiasm, Burke overloaded his existing staff with
work on developing last year's test issue of Women Outside. One
result was that the added stress contributed in part to six staff
members quitting the company, said former staff members and Burke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly saw some sacrifices being made,'' said Burke,
referring to the burdens placed on his Outside staff while they
were finishing the test issue of Women Outside. ``But with
additional competitive magazines coming into the marketplace, I
thought it would be best to hire an additional team promptly.''
(The first issue of Women Outside will appear on newsstands on June
1, with a new, separate staff.)
</P>
<P>
   At Time Inc., a different problem has arisen, one of a spinoff
first enthusiastically embraced and then abandoned temporarily in
the corporate maze. Last fall, Lisa Gabor, then an editor at In
Style magazine, wrote a proposal suggesting a magazine (the working
title: Biz Style) that would be spun off In Style, the monthly
celebrity bible. Norman Pearlstine, the editor in chief of Time
Inc., thought the idea was terrific, and so did the editors of In
Style.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was one of the top editors of In Style,'' Pearlstine said.
``She had the idea of doing something that was more connected to
business and by extension to men.''
</P>
<P>
   But the editors of In Style, who are already developing a bridal
spinoff and whose readership is predominantly women, asked Ms.
Gabor to take her idea to a group more accommodating to the male
market. Ms. Gabor and her idea then moved to the Business
Information Group _ the group that includes Fortune, Money and
probably the least style-conscious of the Time Inc. magazines,
Mutual Funds magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Because Fortune already produces a special issue based on a
similar notion called Business Life every fall, Ms. Gabor found
herself competing against an existing part-time title, which
Fortune staff members felt already covered ``men and their toys and
moguls on ranches,'' in the words of one staff member. Pearlstine
said the magazine was being developed and may appear as a
stand-alone, with no other magazine's imprimatur on it.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the advertising possibilities for a magazine
like Biz Style are appealing; the Fortune Business Life special
issue attracts new advertisers to Fortune each year, said Fortune's
publisher, Jolene Sykes.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, advertisers are attracted to spinoff families because
they get discounted prices for buying packages of advertising in
several related magazines at once. But on the down side, the
advertising industry is wary of publishers overly stretching their
brand names.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very adamant when I'm in the room with magazine publishers
who want to extend their brand to women,'' said Alan Jurmain, the
media director at Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS. ``I have a hard time
believing that women need their own magazine to talk to them about
stocks splitting or sports.'' Jurmain said that Sports Illustrated
for Women ``is an uphill trek.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're assuming that the brand is that elastic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The People division at Time Inc. has proved that, at least for
now, its brand name is supple and elastic. Teen People, introduced
in February 1998, with a 500,000 rate base _ the circulation
guaranteed to advertisers _ now has a circulation of 1,279,000,
with a guaranteed rate base of 1.2 million. Ad pages have doubled
in the first year, to 92.5 in this year's April issue from 45 pages
in last April's issue, said a Teen People spokeswoman. (The
magazine is not yet monitored by the Publishers Information Group,
which charts advertising revenue.)
</P>
<P>
   In Style's ad pages have quadrupled _ to 1,939 in 1998 from 510
in 1995 _ since it was introduced, and circulation has doubled, to
more than 1.2 million in 1998 from 668,000 in 1995, according to
the Audit Bureau of Circulation. At the same time, some of their
success can be attributed to the continued growth of People, which
saw its ad revenue rise to $626.5 million in 1998 from $437.6
million in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Moore, president of the People division at Time Inc. _ the
group that includes People, In Style, Teen People and People en
Espanol _ is a cheerleader for the roomy People brand and sees
endless possibilities. She said a title like Teen People en Espanol
for Girls was not out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a need for it in the market, we'll publish it,''
Ms. Moore said, and added: ``Some people look at the newsstand and
see it as crowded. I look at it and see wide open spaces waiting to
be filled with more offspring.''

MICROSOFT'S SETTLEMENT TALKS HINGE ON PC MAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They will not be at the table on Tuesday when the Justice
Department and state attorneys general are scheduled to meet with
Microsoft in Washington for settlement talks.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States' personal computer makers _ and Microsoft
Corp.'s relationship with them _ will be the main topic of
discussion as the two sides warily approach each other to see if
there is some way to settle the antitrust suit against Microsoft,
according to lawyers close to the case.
</P>
<P>
   To try to get settlement talks started, Microsoft sent the
government a framework document of less than four full pages last
week. But if the negotiations are to move ahead, the lawyers said,
Microsoft is going to have to go far beyond that initial step.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, they say, must be willing to open up its pricing and
marketing contracts with the manufacturers in ways that
fundamentally alter its relationship with personal-computer makers.
The current relationship too often leaves the manufacturers, a
government official said, in the position of being ``captive
distributors for Microsoft software and the high-tech equivalent of
indentured servants.''
</P>
<P>
   The government is skeptical about how much power over PC makers
Microsoft is willing to concede. On the assumption that settlement
talks will fail, the Justice Department has recently been trying to
persuade industry executives to testify as rebuttal witnesses when
the trial resumes.
</P>
<P>
   In the last couple of weeks, officials have focused in
particular on urging Theodore Waitt, the chairman and co-founder of
Gateway Inc., to testify for the government, a lawyer close to the
case said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gateway declined to comment on whether Waitt
might testify.
</P>
<P>
   The framework document from Microsoft mentioned easing the
contract restrictions on computer makers, such as allowing them
greater freedom in presenting software products from Microsoft's
rivals on the first desktop screen that users see when they turn on
their machines.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft has already eased some of those restrictions under
pressure from the government and the industry, leaving little that
was new in the document, according to lawyers who have seen the
Microsoft proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Microsoft would not be expected to put a complete
offer on the table even before negotiations had begun. In broad
terms, Microsoft, according to people close to the company, has
told the government that overhauling its relationship with PC
makers would amount to a change in the competitive structure of the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that is far from the structural reform that has been
mentioned as the kind of legal remedy that might be sought by the
government if it wins the case. Structural options include measures
like breaking up Microsoft or forcing it to license the software
code for its industry-standard Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   In their public statements, the 19 states that have joined the
federal government's suit against Microsoft have been particularly
intent on seeking sweeping sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   But one state attorney general in the case observed that the
PC-maker-focused approach ``could be in the ball park for
addressing our concerns about restoring competition in the
industry.'' But he added that what Microsoft has proposed so far is
``barely in the stadium, way off in left field in the bleacher
seats.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has held detailed discussions with PC makers
about steps to make them less beholden to Microsoft. As a result of
those consultations, the government, according to a lawyer close to
the case, has compiled a list of what it considers necessary steps.
</P>
<P>
   The government, he says, wants to see Microsoft publish the
prices it charges personal-computer makers for the Windows
operating system. Under this concept, the only variation allowed in
prices would be volume discounts for large purchasers, which are
standard practice in any industry. But the major producers like
Compaq, Dell, Gateway and Hewlett-Packard would receive the same
price.
</P>
<P>
   What Microsoft could not do, under this proposal, would be to
offer a PC maker the incentive of an additional discount on the
Windows price if it also agreed to bundle in other Microsoft
products _ like its Office suite of productivity programs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another focus of the government's concern, the lawyer close to
the case says, is in the confidential ``market development
agreements'' that Microsoft has with PC makers. The secret pacts
often include a couple of hundred items, according to one industry
executive, some of which are tied to Windows pricing. The items can
include discounts of 25 to 40 cents on the Windows price, the
executive said, for preferred presentation of Microsoft logos or
product icons on the company's machines.
</P>
<P>
   For manufacturers that ship millions of PCs a year, he noted,
those small incentives can add substantially to profit.
</P>
<P>
   The government also wants to make sure that Microsoft cannot
threaten to put a PC maker out of business by cutting off its
Windows license, a threat Microsoft made to Compaq in 1996, when
the company's consumer group wanted to replace Microsoft's Internet
Explorer Web browser with the browser produced by Netscape
Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has replied that its browser is a part of its Windows
operating system, and thus Compaq was violating its Windows
licensing agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is trying to concede as much as possible without
altering its fundamental business model,'' said David Yoffie, a
professor at Harvard Business School. ``The question is whether
that is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   One proposal that extends beyond PC makers would be to force
Microsoft to publish its program code for the Windows operating
system but without requiring that the code be licensed to other
companies. Under this concept, the published code could not be
reused, resold or redistributed.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, it would not undercut Microsoft's profit from
Windows, but would give Microsoft's competitors in software
development the same access to the inner workings of Windows that
Microsoft's own programmers have, a lawyer close to the case said.

folks will run out of food by midweek. The situation may actually
be worse because the distribution centers where they left the food
are probably being overwhelmed by freshly displaced people. There
are talks of humanitarian air lifts to drop food but no one
believes that's a reasonable solution. Meanwhile, sources in the
provincial capital of Pristina report and confirm the chaos there.

HE'S AT EVERY RACE, AND ALWAYS MISSES FINISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY D. BOGGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
FORT WORTH, Texas _ Jody Muncus is a big racing fan. That's why he
arrived at Texas Motor Speedway at 1 p.m. Tuesday and why he was at
the track at 5 a.m. yesterday. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's why he will attend 36 NASCAR events this year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the 27-year-old who hails from Booneville, N.C., won't see
one race from start to finish. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's because you'll find Muncus in the STP trailer, selling
merchandise for the Richard Petty-owned team that fields the No. 43
STP Pontiac driven by John Andretti. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll watch a little on TV,'' Muncus said. ``It'll die down a
little once the race starts, but I never get to see the beginning
or end of a race.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such is life when you're part of the 13-member road crew selling
official souvenirs. Up at 3 a.m., leave the motel at 4, arrive at
the track at 5 and open the souvenir trailer at 6. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then do it all again ... in Bristol, Tenn. ... Martinsville, Va.
... Talladega, Ala. ... Fontana, Calif. ... 17 states in 10 months,
and a lot of miles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Muncus doesn't mind. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove trucks before I got this job, so it wasn't that big of
a change,'' said Muncus, in his first year hawking Andretti
merchandise. ``I like to travel anyway.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Business has been good at TMS, Muncus said, with sales ranking
up with the numbers at Daytona. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, who is Muncus' favorite driver? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``John Andretti,'' he said quickly, even though it's 7 a.m. and
Muncus has been up for four hours. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And who'll win the race? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``John.'' &QL;

PATENTS: INTERACTIVE TV; RAIN-FOREST PLANT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week a tiny New York company received a huge patent that it
says covers many aspects of pay-per-view television as well as the
integration of Internet content into television programming.
</P>
<P>
   This patent, the seventh so far issued to Personalized Media
Communications LLC, is unusual for its heft as well as its breadth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely broad,'' said Mark Lemley, a University of
Texas law professor specializing in intellectual property. ``It
covers the basic sort of Web TV applications. But it might cover,
even more broadly, customized interactive information.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the company contends that its patents cover the practice
of directing any type of television advertising or content to
specific households or demographic areas.
</P>
<P>
   Several patent experts speculated that last week's patent might
well set a record for the number of references it contains to
``prior art'' _ the way the Patent Office refers to previous
inventions related to the one described in a particular patent.
</P>
<P>
   Many software patents have been criticized for containing few,
if any, references to related inventions. Patents with a paucity of
prior art are considered more susceptible to lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Personalized Media's patent, though, contains more than a
thousand such citations.
</P>
<P>
   The patent is also unusual because its lineage dates to the
paleolithic era of the Internet and interactive television, to a
patent applied for in 1981 by John C. Harvey, a former investment
banker who has been building a patent portfolio since the late
1970s in the area of interactive television.
</P>
<P>
   And this latest patent is likely to be just one of many progeny
to spring from that original 1981 ancestor. Tom Scott, the
company's patent lawyer, said he submitted more than 300 new patent
applications _ all linked to the original 1981 patent _ in June
1995, a day before a new law went into effect changing the way the
term of a patent is figured.
</P>
<P>
   The main purpose of that law was to thwart ``submarine'' patents
_ that is, patents that applicants manage to keep submerged at the
Patent Office by delaying their issuance until a technology became
widely used enough for the patent holder to reap substantial
royalties from companies that had in the interim brought related
products to market.
</P>
<P>
   Inventors could do this without being penalized, because patents
were valid for 17 years from the date of issuance. The new law,
while extending a patent's coverage to 20 years, calculates the
term of patents applied for after June 1995 from the date of
application. Thus, an invention that takes 18 years to win a patent
will have it for a mere two years.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``submarine patent'' has often been associated with
Jerome Lemelson, an inventor who patented prolifically. He
successfully sued automobile manufacturers and others during the
1980s and 1990s by wielding patents whose original application
dated back to the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said it would be unfair to compare Harvey to Lemelson.
Lemley, on the other hand, called the similarities striking _ and
troubling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This original patent was split and refiled an extremely large
number of times,'' he said. ``That's precisely the sort of thing
that Lemelson did. I don't want to make the statement that he's
deliberately doing this to subvert the industry,'' he said of
Harvey.
</P>
<P>
   ``But regardless of the intent,'' he added, ``the effect on the
industry is the same _ he has taken an industry by surprise. A
fairly robust industry grew up in this technology during the time
after which this was filed. All the companies who developed this in
good faith in the interim could in theory be infringing the
patent.''
</P>
<P>
   Personalized Media said it would seek licensing agreements from
companies using technologies described in its patents.
</P>
<P>
   In a preliminary legal skirmish with a number of large companies
_ including DirecTV, a unit of General Motors Corp.'s Hughes
Electronics subsidiary, and Thomson Consumer Electronics, the U.S.
arm of Thomson Multimedia in France _ the federal U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals recently ruled that a claim in Personalized
Media's sixth patent was invalid.
</P>
<P>
   While this was only one claim of many in the patent, it could
foreshadow troubles for Personalized Media, said Walter Hanchuk, a
lawyer with Morgan &AMP; Finnegan, a firm whose clients include some of
the defendant companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court found only one claim invalid, but this could
nevertheless have a serious impact on the validity'' of subsequent
patents issued to Personalized Media, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey and James W. Cuddihy most recently received patent
5,887,243, which was assigned to Personalized Media.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon Tribes Seek Patent Revocation
</P>
<P>
   A group representing Amazonian tribes said it would file a
request with the Patent and Trademark office on Tuesday to revoke a
patent issued in 1986 for a rain-forest plant that shamans use in
religious ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The Coalition for Amazonian Peoples and Their Environment
contends that the patented version of the plant _ Banisteriopsis
caapi _ grows naturally throughout the Amazon and is not a new
variety.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the World Wide Web at www.uspto.gov or
may be ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the
Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

ACCESS TO BIRTH CONTROL LOWERS RUSSIA'S ABORTION RATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ On a recent Tuesday morning when Women's Health Service
No. 15 in central Moscow held its regular abortion clinic, the
waiting room was empty. Of the half dozen cots in the recovery
room, only one was filled.
</P>
<P>
   Masha, a 23-year-old mother with sad blue eyes, was the only
woman in that day for a ``mini,'' or early abortion, which in
Russia, as once in the Soviet Union, is available on demand.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, the waiting room would have been crowded with
pregnant women. But as the birth rate in Russia has plunged, so has
the number of abortions _ from a high in 1988 of 4.6 million to 2.5
million in 1997. After decades of waiting, Russian women finally
can explore other means of birth control.
</P>
<P>
   In Soviet times, abortion was the main means of birth control:
The rule of thumb was almost two abortions for every live birth.
That fact, then hidden from public view, was one of the most
shameful aspects of a medical system that routinely neglected its
female patients, from birth to death.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Soviet women die more often in childbirth and
undergo more abortions than Western women, but they were not even
provided with the most elementary sanitary products, let alone easy
access to the Pill or other reliable contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
   With Communism's collapse, birth control, once a subject that
was considered vaguely indecent, became a matter of public
discussion. Articles appeared in newspapers, gynecologists appeared
on television talk shows but most important, contraceptives, all
imported from the West, appeared in pharmacies. In 1993, the
Russian Health Ministry began a family planning program, opening
more than 200 clinics around the country, retraining doctors,
midwives and nurses, and providing an eager public with information
and advice on sex, pregnancy and birth.
</P>
<P>
   The government's efforts have been amplified by an active
network put in place by the Russian Family Planning Association and
by Western pharmaceutical companies. These firms' entry into the
untapped Russian market has been accompanied by pamphlets,
seminars, billboards and heavily discounted special offerings on
contraceptives made available through women's health centers.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been noteworthy, particularly against the
backdrop of an otherwise crippled health system. Abortions,
maternal mortality and infant mortality have all fallen. In 1993,
for every 100,000 births in Russia, 70 women died during pregnancy
or childbirth, while for each 1,000 children under one year of age,
19 died; in both categories, the rates were roughly three times
those in Western European countries. In 1998, according to
preliminary figures, the maternal mortality rate had fallen to 50
per 100,000 births and the infant mortality rate to 16.6 per 1,000
infants.
</P>
<P>
   Both infant and maternal mortality rates are still much higher
than those of Western Europe. Abortions, available on demand
through 12 weeks, and for medical and social reasons up to 22
weeks, still occur at a higher rate than anywhere in Europe except
Romania.
</P>
<P>
   Attitudes are proving difficult to change. ``Abortion in this
country had become a normal state of affairs, and there were many
women who had five or six without any hesitation,'' said the Rev.
Maxim Obukhov, a Russian Orthodox priest whose parish has become an
anti-abortion movement's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to remember that people were raised in an atheist
state, where children were taught in biology that an embryo was
like a fish. Abortion is a tradition, handed down by mothers, even
grandmothers. To examine attitudes toward abortion is to examine
the vestiges of communism.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering that abortion accounts for roughly one-third of
maternal deaths, the decision by millions of Russian women to turn
to other means of birth control has itself saved numerous lives.
The absolute number of deaths caused by abortion has dropped
dramatically _ from 349 in 1989 to 154 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But some doctors also attribute the improved numbers to the fact
that there are fewer mothers and fewer babies. Russia's birth rate
has dropped, from 13.4 per 1,000 population in 1990 to 8.6 per
1,000 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that there are far fewer pregnant woman, which
means that they are getting much more attention,'' said Maya
Yerokhina, chief doctor at women's Health Service No. 15.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the Research Center for Obstetrics, Gynecology and
Perinatology, Dr. Vladimir Serov, the deputy director and chief
medical specialist, takes cautious pride in the improved maternity
statistics, which, he noted wryly, are the only health indicators
in Russia to show a positive trend recently. But he worries that
Russia's current parlous state threatens even these modest gains.
</P>
<P>
   For Russian nationalists and their Communist allies, the drop in
Russia's birth rate _ taken with the surge in the death rate _ is
seen as a plot to smother Russia in its cradle. For these people,
family planning has become the enemy, despite improved maternal
health and reduced abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The nationalist argument, backed by the Russian Orthodox Church,
did win one battle last year, when the Russian parliament voted to
block federal funds for family planning. Other money, including
some from regional budgets, has been made available to carry on the
program, but subsidies for free or discounted contraceptives are
drying up.
</P>
<P>
   After last summer's financial crisis, family planning advocates
are watching closely to see if Russian couples stop using
contraceptives because they cannot afford them. Foreign
pharmaceutical companies are also concerned, and in some cases have
held down prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance, we have pills that used to cost $1.40 that are
now priced at the ruble equivalent of 70 cents, so women who have
grown used to our products can continue to use them,'' said
Alexander Shlychkov, a gynecology specialist at the German
pharmaceutical company Schering.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study in the central Russian region of Ivanovo, where
Russia's Family Planning Association has an active chapter,
indicates that the economic crisis _ which hit in August when the
ruble's downward plunge began _ has already taken its toll. Sales
of birth control pills, which had crept upward from January to
July, began to tumble in August.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the crisis, doctors and pharmacists discovered a
strong resistance to the Pill, which many Russian women were
convinced causes cancer. It is not uncommon for doctors to hear
women say that they think abortions are safer than pills and that
safest of all are the old folk formulas concocted by their peasant
grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, use of birth control pills here shot up in the 1990s,
as younger women became sexually active and began using them. In
1990, only 1.7 percent of Russian women in their fertile years took
the Pill; in 1997, the percentage was 6.8 percent, a surge that
family planning experts call rare, and dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the best of contraceptives, women still get
pregnant, which is why Masha showed up recently for her second
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   In a wan voice, she explained her family's dilemma. Her first
child, a 5-year-old boy, suffers from a rare tissue cancer that
drains the salary of her husband, a physician's assistant, and her
energy as a mother. At this point, she said softly, a second child
was simply out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if the financial situation was different, if our child
was healthy, but ... .'' Her voice trailed off as she brushed a
lock of hair from her tired face.

INTERNET COMPANIES INTRODUCE A NEW MATH
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (jw) 
 By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thousands of companies, online and off, are blossoming because
of the Internet's fertile new soil for conducting commerce and
serving customers. But the blush may be rapidly fading from the
rose for many Internet-only businesses built on the increasingly
dubious strategy that whatever millions of dollars they lose today,
they will later ``make it up in volume.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``volume'' argument, which has become a mantra in the
Internet economy, comes in a couple of common varieties.
</P>
<P>
   A ``content'' company like the women's Web site iVillage, for
example, was able to raise $292 million in its first day on the
stock market last week, giving the company a market valuation of
$2.22 billion _ an astonishing figure, considering its widely
publicized financial problems and its underwhelming popularity
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Internet content companies, it did this by selling
investors on the notion that it would eventually generate high
enough traffic to the site that advertisers wanting to pitch goods
and services to the gold-mine women's market would someday support
iVillage's cost of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the volume concept for Internet retailers relies on a
two-step strategy: Their rock-bottom prices, often below cost, will
attract customers and revenue. Then, once they accumulate enough
volume in traffic and transactions to be considered competitors,
profit will eventually come from advertisers as well as from
various undisclosed financial arrangements with distributors and
vendors.
</P>
<P>
   The volume model has always had its detractors, most of whom
have been painted as hopelessly parochial neo-Luddite party
poopers, or worse.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing number of industry watchers and executives have
begun to question how a volume-driven Internet can survive, let
alone grow, when its native businesses can bring themselves to
utter the ``P'' word only in the negative. ``No profit for the
foreseeable future'' is now a boilerplate disclaimer in the
prospectus of an Internet company preparing an initial stock
offering.
</P>
<P>
   It is especially bewildering when most Web-based retailers seem
unconcerned that the Internet, with its ability to provide quick
and easy price and feature comparisons for products, is the perfect
profit-margin-killing machine.
</P>
<P>
   Using the inscrutable mathematics with which many Internet
retailers conduct business, closing the sale is the important
thing, even if rock-bottom pricing means that they lose money.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it is a common practice for Internet-only companies
that sell computers and consumer electronics to have two price
lists _ one for customers who shop through price-comparison
services and another, significantly higher, set of prices for
customers who arrive from other precincts on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   And these retailers often do not make good on the lower prices
they promise. An increasingly common tale is the one told by
Michael Tchao, a technology consultant who thought he bought an IBM
Think Pad computer _ twice _ by using one of the leading
price-comparison sites.
</P>
<P>
   On two occasions, the lowest-price retailers, as determined by
the comparison site, confirmed his order, then reneged, stating
that the computers were no longer available. To no avail, Tchao
reminded both that they were still advertising the computer exactly
as he had ordered it.
</P>
<P>
   Neither company will ship Tchao a computer at the price
advertised. Yet both are now in possession of every bit of personal
information, including his credit card number, that would be
required to make Tchao look like an actual customer in their
databases. This is valuable information for Internet businesses
that would have their companies valued on popularity rather than on
profitability.
</P>
<P>
   The story nicely illustrates an idea articulated by Mark
Anderson, a technology consultant and publisher of the Strategic
News Service newsletter (www.tapsns.com), in a recent issue devoted
to the shaky strategy of volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of making it up on volume when you are losing on
every product line is a tried-and-true recipe for something other
than success,'' Anderson wrote. And most Internet companies, he
added, do not and apparently cannot erect the traditional barriers
to competition _ like trade secrets, proprietary technology and
extreme start-up costs _ that would someday allow them to corral
profitability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, the harder one looks, from weird stock valuations to
venture funding mania to basic business models,'' he wrote, ``the
more one begins to feel that from a financial perspective, there is
no `there' there.''
</P>
<P>
   But the acceptance of these wacky concepts is driven by the fact
that to date there is only one consistent method of making money on
the Internet _ the initial stock offering in which companies and
their investors sell the public on the possibility of future
growth, achieving valuations that are hundreds, sometimes thousands
of times any earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Then they sell the overpriced stock to day traders.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is, unfortunately, the business that is making the most
sense so far,'' said Anderson, who calls the Internet stock game a
scam, and adding, ``Siphoning funds from losers' gas tanks is an
old game, but one which has never been played for such high stakes
before.''
</P>
<P>
   The disconnect between this game and existing business practices
is stunning even to executives who are moving into the Internet
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who sell things know it is generally a good idea to
sell them for more than you pay for them,'' said Barry Diller,
chairman of the television and shopping concern USA Networks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   An Internet mogul-in-waiting, Diller is fighting to acquire the
search-engine company Lycos Inc., for a price that some investors
do not find very attractive in this era of sky-high valuations of
www.anything.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``The margin of error is zero when speculation drives up stocks
to disconcerting levels,'' Diller said. ``Which reality do you pay
attention to? Stock? Or building a real business?''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Anderson said, ``If the point is not simply to
bilk a bunch of losers, is there real, profitable business to be
done?''

BIG AND SMALL BOOKSELLERS TAKE BATTLE ONLINE  
 STARS ARE RIGHT FOR WEB-SITE MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Bylines follow individual items.) 
(lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since the first megabookstore rolled into the suburban
strip mall, small independent booksellers have cried foul, accusing
the chains of big-foot practices. Now the wailing can be heard in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The independents are rankled over advertising deals that
Internet search engines like Yahoo, Lycos, Excite, Hotbot, which is
a unit of Wired Digital, and Alta Vista have forged with the two
biggest online bookstores _ Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com, a
joint venture of Barnes &AMP; Noble and Bertelsmann.
</P>
<P>
   Under those deals, a user's Web search, almost regardless of the
topic, will yield a list of search results accompanied by a banner
ad for Amazon or Barnesandnoble.com _ whether a book on that topic
exists or not.
</P>
<P>
   Even more grating, the independents say, is that when someone
searches specifically for an independent bookseller by name, they
may still be served up an ad for Amazon.com or Barnesandnoble.com.
In some instances, the ads actually purport to carry a book about
the independent bookseller.
</P>
<P>
   Search on Lycos for Bookstreet, an independent bookseller in
Ukiah, Calif., for example, and you get a hot-link ad _ one that
requires just one click to move to the advertiser's Web site _ that
says ``Books about Bookstreet at Barnesandnoble.com.'' Likewise, a
Yahoo search for Powell's Books in Portland, Ore., brings up a hot
link to ``Books about Powell's Books at Amazon.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the approximately 3,000 independents that sell books
online contend that the practice is fraudulent: Often such books do
not exist. It is also anti-competitive, they contend, comparing it
to someone from Barnes &AMP; Noble walking into a small bookstore and
pasting up ads to lure customers away.
</P>
<P>
   John Conroy, vice president of Soda Creek Press, a small
publisher that operates the 1bookstreet.com Web site, said that
many of the independents have discussed the issue informally among
themselves, but had not decided on a course of action.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble insists that nothing sinister is afoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Banner technology does not discriminate,'' Ben Boyd, a Barnes
&AMP; Noble spokesman, said. His company's advertising deals with the
search services simply call for a banner ad to pop up, whatever the
topic entered into the search box. ``If you type in 1-2-3 the same
thing happens.'' (He's right. Such a search elicits this hot link:
``Books about 1-2-3 at Barnesandnoble.com.'')
</P>
<P>
   The controversy is parallel to complaints earlier this year by
Estee Lauder and Playboy Enterprises, which each filed lawsuits
against Excite on similar grounds. Estee Lauder is suing, for
example, because a search for ``Estee Lauder'' on Excite brings up
banner ads for an online retailer, the Fragrance Counter. In its
ads, the Fragrance Counter portrays itself as a reseller of Estee
Lauder products, which it is not.

   Stars Are Right for Web-Site Move
</P>
<P>
   The timing has nothing to do with April Fool's Day, but this
Thursday is a particularly propitious date for the Astrology Zone
Web site to make its debut on Walt Disney Co.'s Go Network
(www.astrologyzone.go.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``Jupiter is conjunct the sun that day; this happens once a
year,'' said Susan Miller, the astrologer behind the site. ``That
day, it gives more power, brings more benefit. Jupiter expands what
it touches.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astrology Zone has developed a devoted following on Time
Warner Inc.'s Pathfinder Web site
(www.pathfinder.com/twep/astrology). But Ms. Miller had been
looking for a new home for her stargazing service since last year,
when Time Warner began shifting its Internet priorities elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Although executives at Go Network apparently chose the April 1
start-up date without recognizing its astrological significance,
Ms. Miller was negotiating with one eye on her charts. She was
emphatic, for instance, that both Time Warner and Go Network sign
the transition contracts before March 10, when Mercury went
retrograde _ a notoriously difficult planetary period.

   Richard Latman believes there is no such thing as a free lunch _
or a free PC.
</P>
<P>
   That, he said, is why he is selling the Webzter Jr. personal
computer for $299 (not including a monitor, which he will gladly
sell you for an additional $99).
</P>
<P>
   And at that price, Latman is getting orders for more machines
than his 49 employees can churn out.
</P>
<P>
   When his Seattle company, Microworkz Computer, announced two
weeks ago that it would sell inexpensive systems without ads or
gimmicks, his phone lines and World Wide Web site were quickly
jammed with inquiries and orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no free PC,'' he said. ``It's a fallacy in the mind of
Bill Gross.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the widely covered announcement by Gross'
FreePC.com, a start-up company that plans to give away computers to
people willing to have the PCs continuously display ads aimed
specifically at them. Becoming eligible to receive one of the Gross
PCs, though, involves filling out a personal questionnaire _ and
not everyone who registers will get a PC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I ask a million people for personal information so I can
use it to sell to them?'' Latman said. ``No. I don't believe in
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Latman said he had already received orders for 50,000 of the
$299 machines, which he intends to start shipping on April 19.
</P>
<P>
   To meet the demand for the Webzter Jr., Latman plans to add 80
employees and another 60 contract workers to assemble the machines,
which use a Cyrix 300 MII chip and various off-brand components,
include a 3-gigabyte hard disk and 56 kilobit-per-second modem.
Microsoft Windows 98, the industry-standard operating system that
retails for about $100 and comes already loaded on most more
expensive personal computers, is not included with the Webzter Jr.,
which is promoted primarily as a Web-surfing device. (Windows 98
does come with the $99 CD-ROM drive that Microworkz offers as an
attachment to the Webzter Jr.)
</P>
<P>
   With a profit margin only about $36 per PC, it will take a lot
of sales to turn this into a successful business. But Latman, a
former bond trader at Merrill Lynch, insists that it can be done.
And that is not the only point, he contends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Profitability is great,'' he said. ``But the question is, how
do we put computers in the hands of all the children?''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the affordability equation, he said, involves software.
So Microworkz is trying to strike deals with software publishers to
include free versions of their programs with these starter PCs, in
hopes of creating future paying customers. The Corel Corp., for
example, has agreed to offer its Word Perfect software as part of
the deal. And the Internet service provider Earthlink Network is
using the future-customer rationale to offer Microworkz users a
free year of Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Latman insists that his company will work through its backlog,
so that everyone who has ordered a $299 PC so far will get one. By
the end of the year, he hopes to be able to meet demand in this
country and start marketing abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be the hot toy under the Christmas tree this
year,'' he said.

WHERE SHEEP ARE PLENTIFUL AND HAVE REASON TO BE NERVOUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ It was a bad time to be a sheep here. All last
week, it seemed, they were everywhere you looked _ being herded
down crowded streets, peering from taxi windows, even munching
clover on urban balconies. But this was no sheep's holiday. They
were on their way to the slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was the start the Id al-Adha, the feast of sacrifice,
one of the most important festivals on the Islamic calendar. The
holiday is better known as the Id al-Lahma, or the feast of meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Id is our best season,'' said Mohammed Mustafa, a
27-year-old butcher and a beneficiary of the ritual that calls for
Muslims in this crowded capital, and all around the world, to pay
tribute to the occasion by killing a sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Not just any sheep will do. The ritual prescribes that it be a
male, at least a year old and in good health, with intact teeth and
horns. And so, inevitably, prices soar, and anxiety soars _
something like what happens with roses in the United States around
Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``To our clients, I know it doesn't sound fair, but we don't
have a choice,'' said Mustafa, who butchered as many as 30 sheep a
day all week, for what here is the not inconsiderable sum of $150
for a suitable 100-pound specimen. A customer buys it live, brings
it to the butcher, and receives it back in parts.
</P>
<P>
   To save money, and to track down tasty candidates, many Cairo
residents head out of town themselves, picking out a lamb in a
rural village and then driving it home themselves _ making for what
sometimes can be an extraordinary clash between the old and the
modern.
</P>
<P>
   Often the sheep rides in the back seat, along with the children,
or in the back of a truck, with crates of vegetables. And at home
Cairo, a city of more than 14 million people with the greatest
population density in the world, people stick to traditional ways.
They fatten the lamb at home, on a roof or balcony, or even in a
bathroom, until the day when its end must come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still remember when I was a teen-ager and we had two lambs
in the basement, where I was feeding them myself,'' said Said
Abdullah, a driver who lives in Saidda Zainab, a lower-middle-class
section of Cairo. ``When they were supposed to be slaughtered, I
cried and said no, but dad told me to stop, since I should not try
to be more merciful to animals than God himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the Id al-Adha is linked to the climax of the
Muslim hajj, the annual pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca,
birthplace of the prophet Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
   The origin of the ritual of sacrifice lies in a story from the
Koran, in which Ibrahim is ordered by God to sacrifice Ismael, his
only son, in Mecca, but is relieved of that burden at the last
moment, when God sends a lamb instead. In the Judeo-Christian
tradition, Abraham and Isaac play out this drama, in Jerusalem,
where the Dome of the Rock now stands.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Mohammed Taha Abu al-Farh, a scholar Al Azhar University,
said that even today, ``All Muslims around the world should
sacrifice a sheep if they can afford it, and Egyptian Muslims, like
their brothers around the world, keep to this practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Only in Mecca, among the pilgrims, is the practice mandatory.
There, some 2 million sheep were slaughtered early on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But all Muslims who can afford it are encouraged to carry out
the practice, and so countless sheep met their end, as the gesture
on Mount Arafat was echoed, in a sign of absolute obedience to God.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The practice follows prescribed rituals. The sacrifice, usually
of a sheep but sometimes of a cow, must be carried out in a precise
way _ by a trained butcher, who binds the legs, wields a knife with
a quick, single slash, and says the words ``Allahu Akbar,'' or
``God is good.'' The owner of the animal must be present, as a
witness.
</P>
<P>
   And the product of the slaughter is distributed according to a
strict prescription _ a third for the family that made the
sacrifice, another third as gifts to relatives and neighbors, and
the last third for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of that sharing is to leave many people who cannot
otherwise afford meat suddenly awash in it, and that sets in motion
days of gorging, with meat is eaten at nearly every meal _
beginning with the first breakfast, of fatta, a mix of boiled lamb,
bread, rice and soup.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot resist eating,'' said Manal Salaheddin, 29, an
electrical engineer who lives in the wealthy Cairo neighborhood of
Heliopolis and who said she treasures also the ``spirit of giving''
at the heart of the holiday. But also, and inevitably, it is a
holiday of blood _ and, sometimes, of comic relief.
</P>
<P>
   These days, many people do not take part in the sacrifice
itself. Instead, for the last several days, they have been buying
up their meat at busy butcher shops, after the killing has been
carried out at government slaughterhouses.
</P>
<P>
   Many others, though, adhere rigorously to tradition, and long
ago made an appointment with one of the many butchers who, early
Saturday morning, put an end to much of the baaing that has blended
with the noise of traffic on Cairo streets. Some insist that the
sacrifice be carried out at home _ a catalyst for the kinds of
stories that are the stuff of Egyptian family lore.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salaheddin, the electrical engineer, recalled that when she
was an adolescent, her father brought a lamb to their apartment
building. First, she remembered, the lamb tried to ram its
reflection in a mirror in the lobby _ causing $350 in damage, many
times the lamb's worth. Then ``it jumped from the 22nd floor
balcony,'' and that was the end of that experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since then,'' she said, ``we have always kept the lambs either
in a private garage or at the butcher's himself.''

STUDENT ACTIVISM, AIMED AT LABOR, REBOUNDS ON CAMPUSES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., D.C. Conn., Mich., Mass., Wis., R.I., N.Y., N.J.,
Calif., Md., Va., Ind.)  (jw) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the biggest surge in campus activism in nearly two decades,
student protests have burst onto the scene with rallies, teach-ins
and sit-ins protesting sweatshops and other labor issues.
</P>
<P>
   Students at Duke, Georgetown, Yale and 20 other institutions
have focused on the sweat shirts and caps emblazoned with college
names that are sold in every university shop, demanding that the
companies that license college names not use overseas sweatshops.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, University of Michigan students took over the
office of the president to make such demands. The week before, 350
Harvard students held a rally to make similar demands, while also
calling for raises for many of Harvard's janitors and dining hall
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The protests are the biggest wave of campus activism since the
anti-apartheid movement in the early 1980s, when students called on
colleges to sell off stock in companies doing business in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The surge stems in part from unions' efforts to attract students
to labor's cause and to train them to be activists. Over the past
three years, unions recruited hundreds of students for summer
internships and, upon returning to campus, many of these students
were galvanized to continue their battle to help workers in the
United States and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The snowballing protests have included sit-ins at Duke,
Georgetown and the University of Wisconsin and demonstrations at
Brown, Cornell and Princeton. Last month, 40 Yale students staged a
``knit-in'' to highlight sweatshop abuses, while students at Holy
Cross and the University of California at Berkeley staged mock
fashion shows in which undergraduates walking the runway described
the dismal conditions in which many garments were made.
</P>
<P>
   While today's protests bring back memories of the raucous '60s
and anti-war demonstrations, the current activism is different. It
is less vociferous, it has focused on labor issues _ there have
also been rallies to defend affirmative action and promote gay
rights _ and it often has the sympathy of administrators.
</P>
<P>
   The demands are also more modest than, say, the overthrow of
capitalism. They include independent monitoring of factories that
make college-name apparel, and a living wage for their workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not asking for a revolution,'' said Tico Almeida, a Duke
senior who led a 31-hour sit-in in the office of Duke's president.
``We're just asking for improvement of working conditions. It
doesn't seem like a lot to ask for.''
</P>
<P>
   So far the protests have not involved violence. And in a far cry
from decades past, university presidents have not demanded the
arrest or ouster of students who occupied their offices. Many
officials have even praised the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are terrific students,'' Lee Bollinger, president of the
University of Michigan, said of the 30 students who occupied his
office and the 200 others who rallied outside. ``They're just the
kind of students you want on your campus. They were interested in a
serious problem, they were knowledgeable about the problem, and
they really wanted to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to recognizing that arrests can increase tensions,
many college officials marched themselves when they were
undergraduates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the '60s, I was a student holding a sign,'' said Allan
Ryan, a lawyer in Harvard's general counsel's office who has been
the university's chief negotiator with anti-sweatshop students.
``Now I look out the window and say, `Students are protesting.
Let's see what's on their minds.' Now we look at student protests
as being a normal part of the educational process.''
</P>
<P>
   With encouragement from the apparel workers' union, Unite,
students have seized on the sweatshop issue as a clear-cut subject
that hits close to home and that they can make a difference on.
With $2.5 billion in college-name merchandise sold nationwide each
year, students are confident they can use their moral stature and
their universities' financial muscle to bring about changes in
manufacturing, even overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an issue which really moved a lot of people because,
while the workers are making our clothes thousands of miles away,
in other ways we're close to it _ we're wearing these clothes every
day,'' said David Tannenbaum, a Princeton junior who helped
organize a rally that drew 250 students.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone applauds the protests. Laura Vanderkim, a Princeton
sophomore, said, ``Who is a well-to-do Princeton student to say
what a living wage is in Bangladesh or China? These workers may
make above average wages for the area. And arbitrarily raising
wages could cause layoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidenced by protests at Harvard, Fairfield and Johns Hopkins,
another issue catching fire is wages for the lowest-paid campus
workers, typically janitors and food workers. At the University of
Virginia, students have joined with clergy and civil rights groups
to argue that amid campus privilege, it is unfair that school
employees earn $6.50 an hour and need two jobs to get by.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Students with different backgrounds have joined the protests for
different reasons. Xochitl Marquez, a University of California at
Los Angeles junior, became involved because a Mexican relative had
deformed a hand working in sweatshops. At Notre Dame, many
protesters were inspired by Roman Catholic teachings that all
workers should be treated with respect.
</P>
<P>
   Some protesters are ``red-diaper grandchildren'' or the children
of '60s protesters. And many students began organizing protests
after participating in Union Summer, a program in which hundreds of
students work as union interns, helping to organize low-paid
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great untold stories in the '90s is that Union
Summer has created from almost nothing activism on campus to a
point where labor issues are among the leading issues among
students today,'' said Greg Smith, a Columbia graduate student in
sociology.
</P>
<P>
   Duke President Nannerl Keohane said the protests grew out of a
quiet type of student activism: community service in which students
tutored children or worked at soup kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   ``This generation is one where there's a very strong sense of
personal responsibility to make a difference for immediate, real
people you can see and touch,'' Ms. Keohane said, adding, ``My own
hunch, as a political theorist, is this sweatshop movement is a
direct outgrowth of this practical mindset.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressured by students, many schools have agreed to require
monitors and the disclosure of the names and locations of
factories, a step that would make monitoring easier but is opposed
by many companies because they do not want competitors to know
about their factories.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the University of Michigan agreed to a
far-reaching code of conduct for the companies that produce the
university-name apparel that called for monitoring and disclosure
and said workers at these companies' factories should receive a
living wage. But, to the students' chagrin, the university did not
commit to a living wage standard because it had not been defined.
</P>
<P>
   Students hailed the university's commitments as a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This code of conduct is as strong as it is for one reason:
student activism,'' said Peter Romer-Friedman, a leader of the
sit-in.

KOSOVO WAR PUTS HEAVY STRAIN ON MACEDONIA'S STABILITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TETOVO, Macedonia _ As a mullah sang out the call to prayer at a
mosque next to the post office, local volunteers Sunday distributed
sheep, ritually slaughtered for the Muslim holiday that began
Saturday, to Albanian refugees from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A few streets away, one of the leaders of the Albanian
nationalist movement in Macedonia warned that religion should be
kept out of the edgy politics of his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two problems,'' said Arben Xhafari, leader of the
Democratic Party of Albania. ``The effort to marginalize Albanians
in this society is one. The more inherent problem is the
Islamization of Albanian culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Tetovo, a small, bustling Macedonian city, is something of an
anomaly: the majority of its 300,000 residents are ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonian Slavs, who are the dominant ethic group in this
former republic of Yugoslavia, are in a minority here. Tetovo is,
in a way, the capital of the Albanian nationalist movement.
Especially now, when the war in Kosovo is putting heavy strains on
the country's fragile stability, Albanian leaders here are
struggling to keep up their battle for equal rights, without
sliding into the ethnic and sectarian divisions that have brutally
torn apart other former Yugoslav republics.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia is now the only former Yugoslav republic that has
peacefully retained an ethnically mixed society. The war in Kosovo,
waged at Macedonia's borders, is harshly testing the country's
ability to keep itself intact.
</P>
<P>
   It is a country with all the ingredients for a Bosnian-style
debacle _ poverty, political instability and fierce ethnic and
religious rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   But what is working in its favor is an ambition to move toward a
Western-style democracy and, most important, a widely shared dread
of ending up like its wartorn neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all recognize how important it is to keep Macedonia stable
in the middle of a very rough neighborhood,'' a senior Western
diplomat said, noting that the crisis mentality here is very real.
``But Macedonians have always understood the first rule for a small
country in the Balkans: Keep your head down and survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia has not exactly done that. It took a risk by allowing
10,000 NATO troops to be deployed along its borders as the vanguard
of the NATO force that would have kept the peace in Kosovo if
Yugoslavia had accepted a settlement for Kosovo autonomy. But
negotiations fell apart, and NATO began bombing Belgrade and its
strategic points in Kosovo. Now Macedonia is hoping that those NATO
troops will protect them from attack from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the government of Macedonia, which is in the
``Partnership for Peace,'' the cooperative arrangement that NATO
extended to former Soviet bloc nations, asked urgently to be
admitted into NATO. ``We have given NATO everything they asked
for,'' a Macedonian official told Reuters. ``And we need guarantees
on their part.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO is unlikely to take such a step any time soon, but the
request was a sign of just how exposed and vulnerable Macedonia
feels.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to a riot on Thursday outside the U.S. Embassy led by
Serbian sympathizers in Macedonia, Pavle Trajanov, the country's
interior minister, warned of ``attempts by terrorism to deteriorate
the stability of our institutions and the state and to involve
Macedonia in the so-called Kosovo scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia's eagerness to align itself with the West and to
protect itself from Serbian reprisals is putting strains on its
coalition government, which is made up of a Macedonian Slav party;
the Democratic Alternative, a pro-Serbian group, and Xhafari's
Democratic Party of Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians in Macedonia unequivocally support NATO's
action to protect ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Other ethnic groups, even while fearing that Serbia, the major
entity in Yugoslavia, could threaten their country's sovereignty,
express far less enthusiasm about the presence of NATO troops. The
differences are expressed not just by political leaders, but also
by ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here think Clinton is garbage,'' Slobodan Atanasovski,
a Macedonian Slav who owns a small shop in a Slavic neighborhood of
Tetovo, said sourly. ``We want to be part of Europe, but that
doesn't mean we want to be invaded by American troops.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The yearning to join the West, however, can be seen on the
city's streets. Tetovo, a rundown city of Soviet-style high-rises
and rickety slums, also has a new shopping center and on main
corners, large, colored recycling bins. It was the first city in
Macedonia to introduce the notion of recycling plastic, glass and
tin.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Kosovo refugees have found shelter in the private
homes of relatives or friends here. There is little evident
resentment of their presence by other ethnic groups, who live in
different neighborhoods and are only distantly aware of the new
arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the crisis in Kosovo has heightened existing
Macedonian tensions over national identity and civil rights. Since
1994, Tetovo has had its own university, a cluster of shabby cement
apartment houses converted into classrooms and dormitories, where
6,000 students and 300 faculty members conduct classes in Albanian.
The university is not accredited by the Macedonian government, and
it relies on donations from Albanians in the city, some of whom are
quite prosperous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government of Macedonia doesn't want us to be educated,''
complained the university's rector, Fadil Sulejmani. ``They think
that by keeping Albanians as ditch diggers and street cleaners,
they can keep us down.''
</P>
<P>
   Xhafari agrees, arguing that the only way to avoid a radical
Islamic movement in Macedonia is to build up secular Albanian
institutions, such as schools and universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our global project is to cooperate with the West,'' he said.
He expressed mistrust of his estwhile allies in government, whom he
described as sympathizing with Serbia, but he also acknowledged
that they shared the same long-term goals. ``Spiritually they are
with the East, but their self-interest lies in the West,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Religion, which was never deeply tied to national identity in
Macedonia's history, has not yet surfaced as a major dividing line,
either in Kosovo, or in Macedonia. Ethnic Albanians in both places
did not convert to Islam until the 16th and 17th centuries, and the
religion is observed lightly.
</P>
<P>
   For now at least, Islam is not a rallying cry for the fighters
of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the separatist rebels who have many
Catholics in their ranks and whose leaders recognize the strategic
importance of allying their movement with the West.
</P>
<P>
   For similar reasons, Islam has not been exploited by Albanian
nationalists in Macedonia. And that has helped keep the country
from falling apart. On Friday, only a few men showed up for
afternoon prayer at Tetovo's unusual painted mosque _ a colorful,
richly frescoed testament to how Macedonia mingled Christian art to
islamic tradition imported under the Ottomon empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people do not come here so often,'' Avdi Mustafa, the
mosque's aging caretaker, said a bit sadly. ``They are more
interested in schools and universities than the mosque.''

   As NATO bombers pummel Yugoslavia, President Slobodan Milosevic
pummels the country's independent press.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to tighten an official near-monopoly on what Serbs are
told about the war, Milosevic responded to the bombing by shutting
down virtually all the independent newspapers and silencing the
nation's most prominent independent radio station, B-92.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hearing that all the independent media are shut down,''
Ann Cooper, executive director of the Committee to Protect
Journalists, said Friday. She added that the last Albanian-language
paper was closed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based group has become a clearinghouse for
information about abuses of journalists around the world. On
Thursday, it issued its annual report, Attacks on the Press in
1998. An encyclopedic, 390-page study that runs from Afghanistan to
Zimbabwe, this book reported that around the world last year 24
journalists were killed, 118 were imprisoned and 500 were attacked.
</P>
<P>
   The section on Yugoslavia devoted 10 pages to a campaign of
attacks and censorship of journalists. But attacks on news
organizations intensified so sharply this month that the committee
released an update on Thursday, the day the book was released.
</P>
<P>
   By March 22, all of the Albanian-language press in Kosovo had
closed because of heavy fines imposed in mid-March. The fines
averaged $85,000 for each newspaper, part of almost $1 million in
fines that have been levied on independent newspapers and reporters
since a new press law went into effect in October.
</P>
<P>
   The book reports that on Sept. 30, Voijislav Seselj, Serbia's
deputy prime minister, described independent journalists as a
``fifth column.
</P>
<P>
   Vesna Radavojevac, a Serbian political reporter for the
independent Belgrade daily, Glas Javnosti, was caught by the
outbreak of the air war while visiting New York. ``I am very scared
that the journalists from the independent media will be the first
victims, she said on Friday. ``It is a great opportunity for
Milosevic to get rid of the opposition.''

USING YOUR NOODLE ABOUT Y2K BUG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Tampopo'' is a favorite cult film in our house, mainly because
it's about food.
</P>
<P>
   The film focuses upon a truck driver who wages an endless search
across Japan for the perfect bowl of noodle soup.
</P>
<P>
   I have finally diagnosed his problem: The film's hero was
searching the wrong country.
</P>
<P>
   The people seeking solutions to the Y2K ``crisis'' are making
the same error. The solution doesn't lie in Redmond, Wash., or in
California's Silicon Valley. What we have to do is move the
headquarters for Microsoft and other major computer companies to
Luoyang or Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
   OK, American computers develop a nervous headache when they
contemplate the arrival of Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   There is no crisis in China, where the people are living in the
Lunar Year 4697. On the Tibetan Buddhist calendar, it is Earth-Hare
Year 2126. The Tibetan monks disposed of Y2K 126 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   My moment of enlightenment concerning noodle soup and computer
clocks dawned a few moments after I added a dollop of hot chili
sauce to my $5.50 chopsticks banquet at Pho So 1 in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Like the truck driver in ``Tampopo,'' two brothers-in-law _ Fred
Bell and Jack Hall _ embarked upon a quest to find the perfect bowl
of the Vietnamese soup known as pho.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of pho parlors, and noodle-soup aficionados, in
the Seattle area these days. Bell and Hall whispered the news to
me. Pho So 1 serves the best pho. Who knows? It may be the best in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The secret lies in the broth, which is best made with beefy soup
bones and a hunk of rump roast simmered for a few hours with
peppercorns, cinnamon stick, cloves, coriander seeds and a couple
of spoonfuls of Asian fish sauce.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer to eat my noodle soup at Pho So 1. At home I might stir
up a similar Thai dish you could call:
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Street Soup
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup canola oil
</P>
<P>
   4 cups diced, red potatoes
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chili powder
</P>
<P>
   1 cup beef broth
</P>
<P>
   1 pound sirloin steak, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons fresh ginger, minced
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup fresh cilantro leaves
</P>
<P>
   5 cups Thai seasoned broth
</P>
<P>
   Pour 3 tablespoons of oil into a skillet, then add potatoes and
cook over medium heat 4 or 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir
in the chili powder and the cup of beef broth. Cover and simmer
until potatoes are tender and broth has been absorbed. Remove
potatoes to a warm bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Add the remainder of the oil to the skillet. Toss in the beef
strips, garlic and ginger and stir-cook just until the beef no
longer looks raw. Add the cilantro leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Divide the potatoes and beef mixture among four large bowls. Add
hot Thai broth and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Thai Broth
</P>
<P>
   5 cups beef broth
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup diced green onions
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground cardamom
</P>
<P>
   1 stick cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   Cayenne pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   In a saucepan heat together the broth, onion, cardamom, cinnamon
and cumin. When the broth is steaming add cayenne pepper a bit at a
time to achieve the desired level of hellfire. You can also add a
dash of Sriracha hot chili sauce, which occupies a place of honor
at most Thai or Vietnamese tables. Remove the cinnamon stick before
pouring the broth over the beef and potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Here is another terrific noodle dish:
</P>
<P>
   Thai Thighs and Noodles
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces dried rice noodles
</P>
<P>
   1 and one-half tablespoons canola oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon red curry paste
</P>
<P>
   1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons Thai fish sauce
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons lime juice
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces bean sprouts
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup chopped peanuts
</P>
<P>
   3 green onions, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 cup fresh cilantro leaves
</P>
<P>
   Cook or soak the noodles according to package directions. Or you
can follow these general rules: If you are using vermicelli, you
usually need only to soak the noodles in hot water until they are
pliable. Rice sticks, on the other hand, should be cooked in
boiling water 2 minutes or until they reach the stage of al dente
spaghetti. When done, toss with { tablespoon of oil to prevent
sticking.
</P>
<P>
   Slice the chicken thighs into thin strips.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a skillet or wok. Add
the curry paste (I used Thai Accents brand) and stir-cook 1 minute.
Add half the chicken strips and stir-fry 2 minutes. Remove, add the
rest of the chicken and cook another 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Return all the chicken to the pan and add the fish sauce and
lime juice. Bring to a boil and simmer 1 minute. Add the bean
sprouts and noodles and toss well. Add the garlic and green onions
and cook 1 minute.
</P>
<P>
   Plunk the contents of the pan onto a warm platter and sprinkle
with peanuts and cilantro.
</P>
<P>
   Serves four.

CAPE TOWN VIGILANTES LOSING PULL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa _ The police intelligence document that
Superintendent Wicus Holtzhausen plucks from his briefcase is a
warning that he is on a hit list.
</P>
<P>
   He was, it says, among those branded ``political criminals'' who
``should be eliminated'' whose names were read out recently at the
mosque where the Muslim group called People Against Gangsterism and
Drugs, was formed.
</P>
<P>
   It is no idle threat. Already this year, two senior officers
investigating the group, known by its acronym, PAGAD, have been
gunned down from passing cars, one fatally.
</P>
<P>
   Holtzhausen, spokesman for the continuing investigation, has
been assigned bodyguards, but they are not always around. Police
headquarters here was bombed Jan. 28. PAGAD is suspected, but
denies it. In this police office building _ thanks to bravado,
tight budgets and puzzling management decisions that characterize
the force _ nobody bothers to stop visitors wandering the halls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't walk into my office to get me,'' Holtzhausen
insisted. ``They definitely don't have the heart for that. They're
not suicide-bomber types.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish they would, though,'' he added, grinning to break the
tension of discussing the chances of his own assassination. ``I'm
ready for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Cape Town, which once had a crime rate far lower than
Johannesburg's, is now a city in a three-way war between the
vigilantes of PAGAD, drug gangs that have become powerful over the
last five years, and police. Last year, there were 529 drive-by
shootings and 79 pipe bombings in the Western Cape province, which
includes the city, the vast mixed-race Cape Flats neighborhoods
east of it, and many quiet beach and farming towns.
</P>
<P>
   Many of South Africa's 500,000 Muslims live in the Cape Flats,
most descended from Malay slaves imported by the Dutch East India
company in the 17th and 18th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   PAGAD is suspected of killing more than 25 drug dealers and a
police captain, Bennie Lategan, in addition to wounding a police
superintendent, Schalk Visagie. And it is suspected of bombing,
along with the police headquarters, several smaller station houses,
a synagogue and a Planet Hollywood restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant attack was in August, just after the United
States fired cruise missiles into Afghanistan and the Sudan in
retaliation for the bombings of two American embassies. But no one
has been convicted, so the authorities are careful not to accuse
the group publicly.
</P>
<P>
   PAGAD's representatives deny the accusations but hedge as they
do. Abieda Roberts and Ebrahim Francis, who are on its governing
committee, were asked in a joint interview if PAGAD had shot
officers and bombed stations. Both answered in virtually the same
words, ``No _ as far as we're concerned.'' Mrs. Roberts added
quickly, ``It's never been PAGAD policy to attack police stations
and policemen.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if police were right in saying that PAGAD's armed wing,
the G-Force, is never directly ordered to kill but interprets the
lists of enemies read out at the mosque as targets, they answered:
``We can't speak on behalf of the G-Force. We can't tell you how
they interpret it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't policy to kill,'' Mrs. Roberts added. ``But if people
decide to go out there and kill, it doesn't mean the leadership is
responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, when PAGAD first appeared in the crime-ridden
Cape Flats, it had a Wyatt Earp status. It could rally 5,000 people
at midnight to march from one drug dealer's house to another,
following a masked leader called the emir who would be flanked by
masked guards.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers were given an ultimatum: Confess at the Gatesville
mosque and quit the trade _ or die. Sometimes warnings were
spray-painted on their walls; sometimes gasoline bombs were thrown
against them.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1996, in a moment caught by a television crew and
broadcast around the world, a gang leader named Rashaad Staggie,
who was shoving through a crowd around his house, was beaten, shot
dead and set on fire. His twin brother, Rashied, who took over the
leadership of the gang, was wounded late this month in a drive-by
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Many citizens said they were sad that it took vigilantes to
clean up the area, but they agreed with PAGAD that police were at
best inept and at worst in the pay of the dealers who ran the Hard
Livings, the Americans, the Sexy Boys and other gangs.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, a PAGAD march on a warm Sunday is lucky to get
500 people. A recent one drew only 80.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that misdirected violence has shriveled public
respect. The Planet Hollywood bomb _ which Mrs. Roberts
specifically denied was PAGAD's work, but which the group is still
suspected of carrying out _ blew off the leg of an 8-year-old
British girl. A drive-by shooting apparently aimed at a greengrocer
believed to sell drugs killed his 4-year-old daughter, whose
angelic face was on front pages the next day. Another baby was
killed when the wrong house was firebombed.
</P>
<P>
   A second reason for PAGAD's falling popularity is that it now
openly rejects the government. Crime analysts, police and local
journalists say it was taken over in 1997 by Qibla, an older
Islamic fundamentalist group. But PAGAD's leaders say they do not
endorse an Islamic revolution here _ a quixotic idea anyway,
considering fewer than 2 percent of South African residents are
Muslim. ``We're not stupid,'' Mrs. Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Francis added: ``We object to facets of the constitution.
Like abortion, like no death penalty, like this distorted sense of
human rights that lets gangsters walk free. We want a moral basis
to society.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The two contended that ``police intimidation,'' not their own
loss of touch with the people, has caused PAGAD's rallies to
shrink.
</P>
<P>
   But the rallies have also become dangerous. One on Jan. 8
protesting a visit by British Prime Minister Tony Blair turned into
a shootout inside clouds of tear gas. Police contended that PAGAD
was handing out guns, so officers opened fire with rubber bullets;
PAGAD said that some used live ammunition. One PAGAD member was
killed and other demonstrators were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Although police informants clearly attend rallies and mosque
meetings, the G-Force itself resists infiltration. Peter Gastrow,
an analyst at the Institute for Security Studies, a local research
group, said that it consisted of cells of a few men whose names
were known only to one another and who got their targets not
through a chain of command but from the lists read out at the
mosque.
</P>
<P>
   But it is possible that the police have finally made a dent in
the group. On Jan. 27, extra officers and soldiers began pouring
into Cape Town for a police drive against terrorism called
Operation Good Hope. The bomb at police headquarters, at Caledon
Square, went off the next day, as the operation's leaders were
meeting nearby. The bomb injured 11 pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   Within two weeks, police have arrested what they think are two
G-Force cells. First, they stopped six men in a car at midnight and
found guns and a videotape showing police stations. Two days later,
five more men, also armed, were arrested driving down from
Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials say that one member of the second group is an
informant for South Africa's National Intelligence Agency and that
they believe the five planned to blow up Parliament as President
Nelson Mandela addressed it. The intelligence agency says that Cape
Town Muslim militants are being trained in the Middle East by
Hezbollah, or Party of God, the Lebanese guerrilla group.
</P>
<P>
   Little evidence backing these claims has been released so far,
and police and intelligence agents are feuding over how the
information got out.
</P>
<P>
   But, as one local journalist who used to cover PAGAD put it,
``It's been dead quiet since they busted those two groups.''

   WASHINGTON _ The first NATO missiles and bombs were only a few
hours from striking Yugoslavia when James Hooper, once the State
Department's senior dissenter on Balkan policy, sipped his coffee a
few blocks from the White House and talked of ground troops likely
to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now are going to have to consider a NATO protection force
on the ground to go in on very short notice if the blood-letting
escalates suddenly,'' said Hooper, characteristically speaking the
politically unspeakable on the Balkans without apology.
</P>
<P>
   It has been two years since Hooper, the very model of an earnest
Foreign Service careerist, quit the government in frustration after
26 years of toiling at diplomacy. He joined a handful of pioneer
State Department dissenters who left across two administrations
protesting Balkan policy.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the easiest of choices. ``I had wanted to be in the
foreign service since I was a teen-ager and read `The Ugly
American,''' Hooper said of the novel about intrigues and
frustrations of laboring abroad. ``It got me mad and interested in
foreign affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he plays the role of articulate, impassioned gadfly as
director of the Balkan Action Council, one of this city's countless
independent pressure groups that nip at the heels of government.
``It's as if there's a destiny,'' he said of his sudden decision to
retire from the Foreign Service to promote his views from without,
not within. ``I wanted to follow my dream, and now here's the
Kosovo issue front and center.''
</P>
<P>
   Hooper, who was once the State Department's deputy director of
Eastern Europe in charge of the Balkans, can sympathize with the
American public in its bewilderment over the region. ``To be
honest, I didn't know a damn thing about it,'' he said, referring
to his taking on the Balkans portfolio a decade ago after years of
specializing in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   He soon came to conclude that Serbian ultranationalism was a
threat to European order and to American leadership rooted dearly
in the Allies' anti-fascist victory in World War II. In the midst
of the modern Balkan violence, Hooper's father, a World War II
veteran, told his son he had finished that war in Czechoslovakia
yet only lately has understood what was at stake. The son tries to
stay mindful of his father's lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has to be prepared to use force abroad to
protect democratic values and our interests,'' said Hooper,
describing himself as a Truman Democrat. ``I think we're still
living off the patrimony of the policies of the Truman
administration,'' he said of such bulwark measures as the Berlin
airlift and NATO itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truman's the politician I admire most,'' he said, finding
President Clinton lacking the statesman's instinct of Truman. ``You
get that for being willing to step out into the dark to take risks,
to take responsibility for policies when you don't know the
outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Studying the confrontation as an expert amid the American home
front's considerable confusion, Hooper discusses the complex
problem in terms of two dominant personalities, Milosevic and
Clinton. He finds the authoritarian Serb leader cunningly using
force to test the American leader, a poll-driven consensus
politician who turned late _ not too late, Hooper hopes _ to
forceful intervention and to an overdue lesson for the public about
the global leadership at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the president has to restrain himself from stopping the
NATO attacks too early,'' said Hooper, who was dubious about
Clinton's latest burst of tough talk about Milosevic until the
first NATO missiles actually struck Yugoslavia. ``To pause would be
projected as weakness toward Milosevic,'' he warned, estimating
that if Clinton stays resolved and commits ground troops, if
necessary, the Kosovo outcome could prove as successful as the
earlier Bosnian intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Hooper has a bachelor's degree from the School of International
Service at American University and a masters in Middle Eastern
Studies from Columbia University. His reading ranges from George
Kennan, the former Moscow ambassador and master Sovietologist, to
purely escapist books on mountain climbing. ``You've got to get
away from all this in order to survive,'' he says of his
preoccupation with the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 52, Hooper, a native of Grand Rapids, Mich.,
misses the friends and economic security of the Foreign Service,
but not at all the careerist pressures that can make change from
within a difficult task at any of this city's institutions of
power. Asked about role models, he talks simply of his mother's
lesson in persistence in gaining a college degree late in life when
she was going blind. He talks of steady guidance from his wife and
two grown children. ``It seems to me the fun in life is to try and
get as far as you can by being yourself and sticking to your
principles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always conscious that we were bureaucrats back in
Washington trying to change the policy,'' he said of his State
Department days in wrestling with the Balkans. ``I would drive home
every night and the greatest threat I faced was the traffic, while
there were people out there who were doing the real fighting and
dying,'' he said as he tracked the NATO bombs and missiles finally
falling on the forces of Milosevic.

VIRUS MAY INFECT MORE COMPUTER SYSTEMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ With tens of thousands of computers already
thought to be infected, corporations and network security
professionals said Sunday that they were bracing for the continued
spread of the ``Melissa'' computer virus with the beginning of the
workweek on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, computer security firms said they had received
an unusually large number of calls for assistance from companies
infected on Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa, which is carried by e-mail, appears to be one of the
fastest replicating viruses ever detected because it automatically
tries to mail itself from each recipient's machine to 50 other
e-mail addresses, computer security experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This message may be sitting in a lot of mail boxes dormant,''
said Jeff Carpenter, the incident response team leader from the
Computer Emergency Response Team, or CERT, a Department of
Defense-financed computer security hotline. ``When people go to
work and open it up, a large number of organizations could be
negatively effected.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter said CERT had received 50 to 60 calls on Friday and
Saturday from organizations, ``most of whose mail servers were
incapacitated'' by an overwhelming volume of mail.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it appears that the biggest threat from the virus is
that it overwhelms networks because it reproduces so rapidly, but
it is not thought to otherwise attack the machines it infects.
Also, the infection appears to go dormant after once using a
recipient's computer as a platform to resend itself.
</P>
<P>
   As the virus continued to spread over the weekend, a debate
emerged as to whether it was intended as a malicious attack or was
actually an Internet marketing ploy that spun out of control. The
e-mail message that carries the virus includes an attachment that
lists several dozen Web sites with adult content.
</P>
<P>
   Computer security experts speculated that the virus program
might have been written as an effort to promote the pornographic
sites by automatically spreading them across the Internet in a way
that made each message appear to have come from an acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, said Eugene H. Spafford, director of the Center
of Education and Research in Information Insurance and Security at
Purdue University, Melissa could be a malignant form of ``spam,''
as unsolicited advertising by e-mail is known,
</P>
<P>
   When a user opens the list.doc file attached to the e-mail, it
executes a Microsoft Word macro, a sort of rudimentary program,
which searches the recipient's hard drive for an address list
produced by one of two Microsoft e-mail programs _ Outlook or
Outlook Express.
</P>
<P>
   It then copies the message to the first 50 names in the address
book, giving it the appearance of having been sent by a friend,
colleague or other acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This person may have an economic incentive,'' Spafford said of
the virus' creator. ``He may be trying to propagate his list far
and wide.''
</P>
<P>
   If, on the other hand, the program is actually intended to wreak
havoc with Internet mail servers, Spafford and other security
experts said it could have been much worse. The virus could have
been written _ and could yet be modified _ to carry a far more
dangerous payload, like a program that deletes data.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's entirely possible that within hours to months, we will
see something worse'' Spafford said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Network security experts continued over the weekend to search
for the origin of Melissa. One lead that several said they were
exploring involved a posting made to a sex-related Internet
discussion group early Friday morning, just before the virus
started spreading.
</P>
<P>
   The posting included the same list of pornography sites carried
by the virus.
</P>
<P>
   In at least one other instance, in December 1997, a person using
the same e-mail address posted lists of adult Web sites and
passwords that also contained viruses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The virus hit Friday afternoon, and this message was posted at
7 a.m.,'' said Richard M. Smith, president of Phar Lap Software,
Inc. in Cambridge, Mass. ``One could assume that this message was
the first time the virus existed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Word macros are probably more powerful than they ought to be,
but you do get something for that power,'' said Eric Allman,
co-founder of Sendmail, the Emeryville, Calif., software company
that makes the Internet's most popular post-office program for
routing e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Since the virus appears to affect only computers that are loaded
with both Word and either Outlook or Outlook Express, it appears
designed to take advantage of three of the most popular programs on
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Security experts said that computers loaded with Word and one of
the two Microsoft e-mail programs are vulnerable even if the
default e-mail program on the computer is a competing product like
the Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator mail or Qualcomm's
Eudora.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, Allman said, consumers need to be more aware what
information they are accepting on their hard drives and other
storage devices when they download an e-mail attachment. A setting
within Microsoft Word cautions users when they are about to open an
unknown document that contains a macro and asks if they would like
to continue.
</P>
<P>
   One lasting impact from the attack of the virus is that it
appears to alter the user's settings within Word so that the
program no longer warns users if they are about to open a file with
an unknown macro, Spafford said. The virus ``turns the protections
down on the machine to the lowest setting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Users can tell if they have been infected by the virus by
checking the Windows registry, which is a database that contains a
list of programs downloaded onto the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Among the corporations infected by the virus on Friday were
Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., Lucent and the Intel Corp.

 &HT;    MILOSEVIC: FROM AMBITIOUS APPARATCHIK TO STEELY DICTATOR
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON On a muggy June day in 1989, near a railroad junction
a half hour's drive from the Kosovo capital of Pristina, nearly one
million Serbs gathered in a broad mountain-rimmed meadow called the
Field of Blackbirds.
</P>
<P>
   There, 600 years before, Turkish invaders routed Serbs in a
battle that forever changed the face of the Balkans, opening
Europe's southern underbelly to the voracious appetite of the
Ottoman Empire.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't only Serbs who died on that field. Hungarians stood
with them, as did Poles and Albanians. They were part of an
international force of Christians, answering chiefly to Rome,
mustered to counter the growing reach of Islamic Turks.
</P>
<P>
   The horde that assembled ten years ago, however, came not to
praise the notion of ethnic diversity, but rather to bury it.
Presiding over the wake was an ambitious middle-aged Communist
Party apparatchik named Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Descending upon the masses by helicopter, like a rock star or
some lesser god, Milosevic held out a vision of redemption and
deliverance to those willing to believe that ethnicity was destiny,
particularly for Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kosovo heroism does not allow us to forget that at one
time we were brave and dignified,'' Milosevic admonished the crowd.
``Six centuries later, we are again engaged in battles and
quarrels. They are not armed battles, though such things should not
be excluded yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The world took little notice of this barbed expression of Serb
nationalism. It's paying more attention now.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' said Balkans historian Janusz Bugajski, ``was the
beginning of the end for Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, Milosevic, a tightly wound man with a fondness
for expensive French cognac and double-breasted suits, was elected
president of Serbia, buoyed by the violent waves of
ultranationalism he helped to foment.
</P>
<P>
   In the decade since then, with his influential Marxist wife
Mirjana Markovic at his side, Milosevic has led those same forces
on a bloody Balkan rampage that has left a quarter of a million
civilians dead along a swath extending from Slovenia through
Croatia, to Bosnia and the Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as U.S. and allied warplanes rip daily into the military
and economic underpinnings of his authoritarian regime, Milosevic,
57, is counting on his gifts for using the power of symbols and the
utility of myth to seize political victory from the jaws of a
battlefield defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic, if he knows he's going to lose the military war,
wants to win the propaganda war,'' said Bugajski, director of East
European studies at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, a Washington think tank. ``He wants to go down in history
as the savior of the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a sobering conclusion for U.S. policymakers. It suggests
that the Serb leader has every historical, political and personal
incentive for hunkering down to absorb a protracted campaign of air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   If his Serb forebears could attain martyrdom at the hands of
Turks with long knives, after all, Milosevic hopes to gain the
modern political equivalent, standing no less brave and dignified
against an onslaught of NATO cruise missiles and smart bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The historical template was a defeat, and it was bravely down
to the last man being willing to absorb that defeat rather than
accept compromise,'' said Jerrold Post, director of political
psychology at George Washington University. ``While it may be 600
years ago, it's like today to them. The past is present, and the
heart does not tell time.''
</P>
<P>
   In a culture that looks largely to its legends and tortured
history as the balm for a national psyche traumatized by a century
of turmoil, Milosevic may be the perfect tyrant.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the dawn of World War II to parents who would both
later, and separately, commit suicide, Milosevic seems to have
turned a personal persecution complex into something of a national
ideology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs are the victims of the latest holocaust in this
century,'' Milosevic told the Washington Post in a December
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``My duty is to protect the interests of my people and my
country,'' Milosevic said. ``If anyone has a problem with that, I
can only tell you that I am proud of my role in defending and
protecting the interests of my country, and my people.''
</P>
<P>
   To critics, though, Milosevic is a politically astute psychopath
leading a morally addled nation on a doomed mission to roll back
the tide of history with the blood of innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
   In an Oval Office address to the nation last week, President
Clinton described Milesevic as a dictator ``who has done nothing
since the Cold War ended but start new wars and pour gasoline on
the flames of ethnic and religious division.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks were aimed at explaining why he ordered U.S.
pilots to attack Serb troops who reportedly have killed more than
3,000 ethnic Albanians and run another half million more from their
homes during a year of repression in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, in his December interview, offers a reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Albanian narco-mafia gives money to foreign journalists
and politicians for the media war against us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire Western story of the Yugoslav crisis if false,''
Milosevic railed. ``This is the failure of journalism, moral
failure of journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic brooks no such shortcomings in his own country, where
the state-run media still dominates and journalists for independent
papers and radio stations are subject to fines, imprisonment or
worse for unflattering portrayals of his motives and moves.
</P>
<P>
   To those controls he combines an aggressive state security
apparatus to lock down political opposition and suppress dissent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is,'' said Bugajski, ''the last dictator in Europe.''

</P>
<P>
   In April, 1941, Belgrade fell to Nazi occupation after days of
bombing by Hitler's Luftwaffe. Four months later, Milosevic was
born in the provincial town of Pozarevac, east of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   His father, a theology professor, and his mother, a
schoolteacher, would later divorce. As a young adult, Milosevic
endured the suicide of his father and, years after that, his
mother, who was suffering from cancer.
</P>
<P>
   An economics graduate from Belgrade University, Milosevic scaled
a slippery career pole dominated by Communist Party machinations,
before turning his ambitions toward government.
</P>
<P>
   A quick study in politics and finance, Milosevic became one of
the youngest executives ever at Technogas, the state-owned company
that managed the country's natural gas purchases from the Soviet
Union. He quickly rose to become general director and five years
later he became president of the United Bank of Belgrade. He was 37
years old.
</P>
<P>
   To the Soviet contacts he'd developed in the gas business,
Milosevic added a Rolodex of banking sources from the West,
including many in the United States, which he visited as head of
the Belgrade bank.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he went into politics full time in 1984, heading the
communist party's Belgrade chapter, Milosevic seemed well equipped
to help a country struggling to negotiate the collapse of Soviet
influence and the coming primacy of Western capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   He soon turned his talents, though, toward other ends,
harnessing his personal ambitions to the powerful engine of Serb
nationalism, the enduring source of his authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind this facade of Serbian nationalism, this is not a man
with deeply held beliefs,'' said Post, who has studied Milosevic
extensively. ``His major goal is maximizing his own power and
surviving in power, and certainly not his dedication to the Serb
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is married to Mirjana Markovic, a Belgrade University
professor of Marxist sociology.
</P>
<P>
   Their daughter, Marija, runs a radio and television station in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Son Marko is a flamboyant child of privilege. In a state
impoverished by years of war, Marko flits about in flashy sports
cars and runs a Belgrade disco. On Saturday, as troops under his
father's command pressed their campaign of terror just south of
Belgrade, Marko reportedly signed a multmillion-dollar contract to
build an amusement park called ``Bambiland'' in his father's
hometown of Pozarevac.
</P>
<P>
   In a trend surely disturbing to U.S. policymakers, Milosevic has
seen his opposition wither in the days since NATO launched its
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic is more popular today than he's been since 1989,
when he first rose,'' said former U.S. envoy to Bosnia, Bill
Stuebner. ``Just as we would do, everybody's rallying around the
flag.''
</P>
<P>
   To anyone trying to read the mind of Milosevic, that would
suggest that he's not about to capitulate to continued NATO
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   With no sign that Milosevic might run up the white flag,
Stuebner, a Balkans specialist at the U.S. Institute of Peace, a
Washington think tank, posits a haunting question: ``Are we going
to keep it going until he dies of old age?''

Milosevic started the wars in Croatia, Bosnia and now Kosovo, and
the British defense secretary describes him as a ``serial ethnic
cleanser.'' So why hasn't Milosevic been indicted by the war crimes
tribunal? And why hasn't Radovan Karadzic been arrested? It would
require a change in policy and a more aggressive policy by the U.S.

   KOSOVO-HOOPER (Washington) _ The first NATO missiles and bombs
were only a few hours from striking Yugoslavia when James Hooper,
once the State Department's senior dissenter on Balkan policy,
sipped his coffee a few blocks from the White House and talked of
ground troops likely to follow. It has been two years since Hooper,
the very model of an earnest Foreign Service careerist, quit the

U.S. EMBASSY IN MOSCOW IS SCENE OF GUN BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A masked gunman tried to fire a grenade launcher at the
U.S. Embassy on Sunday, igniting a gun battle that left the
building pockmarked with bullet holes.
</P>
<P>
   While the embassy has been the scene of angry protests over NATO
airstrikes against Yugoslavia in recent days, the motive for
Sunday's attack was not clear. The gunman and at least one
accomplice escaped without giving any indication of their purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-NATO protesters and Russian police officers clung to the
ground during the midafternoon shootout, which ended as the
attackers drove off in a white jeep.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle, which reportedly had been stolen from the police,
was later found riddled with bullets and abandoned in a nearby
courtyard. There were reports that three men had been detained for
questioning, but there was no indication that any of the attackers
had been captured.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations at the embassy took an ugly turn on Thursday
when beer-drinking toughs pelted the embassy with bottles and
paint.
</P>
<P>
   Many windows in the stately yellow and white structure, on
Moscow's main thoroughfare, were broken. Two Moscow policemen were
hit by flying bottles and hospitalized. But the police gave no
indication that they would take a tough stance against the
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Kommersant reported on Friday that most of the
several dozen demonstrators who were arrested soon reappeared at
the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   After Thursday's disorder, additional police officers were
stationed in front of the embassy and the protests became more
orderly. Still, the protesters were allowed to assemble near the
embassy, and their anti-American signs and catcalls were a staple
on the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   While the Russian government's actions have been relatively
restrained _ it has even restated its support for the START-2
treaty _ official statements have been harsh. Igor Ivanov, Russia's
foreign minister, has gone so far as to suggest that NATO officials
be tried for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional tone of the debate has grown so heated that a
group of reform-minded former officials _ Yegor Gaidar, Boris
Fyodorov and Boris Nemtsov _ set off on a peace mission to
Belgrade. The trip appeared to be an effort by a group of generally
pro-Western Russians to protect their left flank. A rally on
Saturday in front of the embassy, which featured Communist leader
Gennady Zyuganov, was generally peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday also started as a relatively quiet day in Moscow, as the
city's residents took advantage of a rare sunny day to drive or
stroll along the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in an episode captured by Russia's NTV independent
television network, a white jeep suddenly stopped in front of the
embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Russian police were initially slow to respond, as a man wearing
a black mask and a camouflage uniform got out of the vehicle. He
raised a grenade launcher to his shoulder, aimed it at the embassy
and attempted to fire it, but failed.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian policeman told NTV that the gunman failed to cock the
weapon properly.
</P>
<P>
   After the police noticed the gunman, who was accompanied in the
jeep by at least one accomplice, several policemen opened fire.
Using a Kalashnikov automatic rifle, the gunmen fired back.
Witnesses later counted 11 bullet holes in the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The jeep drove away through the congested weekend traffic.
Witnesses said that the jeep was abandoned in a courtyard crowded
with children about a five-minute drive away. It had bullet holes
and, according to one account, traces of blood. The witnesses said
that the gunmen, still dressed in their masks and uniforms and
carrying their weapons, ran away.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Inside the U.S. Embassy, Marine guards donned flak jackets,
helmets and guns. Officials and residents in the compound were
urged to stay inside and away from windows.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's attack recalled a 1995 episode in which a
rocket-propelled grenade was fired at the embassy across the same
thoroughfare, apparently in protest at NATO's bombing campaign
against the Bosnian Serbs. In that attack, the grenade struck the
embassy, destroying a copying machine but causing no injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Yeltsin's spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, said the Russian
president had ordered an investigation into Sunday's attack.
</P>
<P>
   Yakushkin said the episode ``throws a shadow on Russia, which is
currently undertaking titanic efforts to solve the crisis around
Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Interior Ministry said it would take steps to prevent
future attacks. It was likely that protesters would now be kept
farther from the building, but the ministry said it would not ban
demonstrations near the embassy.

WHY MILOSEVIC HAS AVOIDED WAR CRIMES CHARGES _ SO FAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton in recent days has described
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia as the ``leader who
started the wars in Bosnia and Croatia,'' and a senior British
official accused him of being a ``serial ethnic cleanser.''
</P>
<P>
   But eight years after the outbreak of war in former Yugoslavia
brought fresh atrocities to Europe at the end of the 20th century,
Milosevic has not been indicted by the international war crimes
tribunal, not even secretly, according to U.S. and tribunal
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Although U.S. officials consider Milosevic largely responsible
for much of the warring that has ravaged the region, the Yugoslav
leader has avoided any legal accountability.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for this, both U.S. and tribunal officials say, lie
with both the tribunal and with the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration made Milosevic a partner in
guaranteeing peace in Bosnia, and neither the court nor the United
States has considered the indictment of Milosevic a priority.
Consequently, they have not devoted the resources to gathering
evidence for an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has said repeatedly that it has
cooperated fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the
former Yugoslavia. But the tribunal does not have the expertise to
ask the right questions about intelligence information, and the
United States has not volunteered evidence that would help the
tribunal build a case against Milosevic as well as others, tribunal
and U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say that evidence that might be used to weigh an
indictment against Milosevic is to be found in the massive amounts
of intelligence that the United States gathered in the former
Yugoslavia, where just about every intelligence gathering asset has
been deployed, from sophisticated spy planes to telephone
intercepts and informants.
</P>
<P>
   But that intelligence has not been fully organized, analyzed and
presented to the tribunal, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an easy case to make,'' said Paul Williams, who was in
the State Department's legal office from 1991 to 1993 and is now
professor of international law at American University here. ``While
I was there, there was a flood of information coming in which
clearly established Milosevic's responsibility for war crimes in
Bosnia, and would have supported an indictment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration could hardly have taken the
initiative to build a case against Milosevic, one senior
administration official explained Sunday, after it adopted the
policy in late 1994 of working with the Serbian leader to bring
about an end to the war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, the United States government, have been the largest source
of information for the tribunal, but we have never compiled
dossiers with the aim of indicting Milosevic, or any specific
individual,'' said this official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The indictment of Milosevic would require a policy change by
the United States,'' he added.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to officials familiar with discussions within the
administration, the prevailing argument against indicting Milosevic
has been that it is necessary to work with him in order to carry
out the Dayton accords, which established the armistice in Bosnia,
and to get a peace agreement in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it is for the tribunal to decide whether or not to
indict Milosevic, but it, too, has been reluctant to proceed
against the Serbian leader.
</P>
<P>
   It did not begin a concentrated effort to develop a case against
him until last October, according to tribunal officials. Resources
were limited, and they were devoted to developing easier cases
against lower-ranking military commanders and not wartime leaders,
several tribunal investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the tribunal's work was not a high priority with the
Clinton administration, officials said, with only junior level
officers at the State Department, Pentagon and CIA assigned to work
with it.
</P>
<P>
   The cooperation improved, but it never matched the public
position from the administration about its support for the
tribunal, said one official.
</P>
<P>
   Institutionally, there is resistance from government agencies
that have valuable information. The CIA worries about compromising
sources and methods of gathering its intelligence. The State
Department worries about protecting the confidentiality of the
diplomat's conversations and cables. At the Pentagon, the attitude
during the war in Bosnia was that there were no good guys, so it
has not devoted energy into digging up information about Serbian
war crimes, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   There was another way to proceed against Milosevic, and that
would have been to prosecute his subordinates and, as one U.S.
diplomat put it, ``squeeze'' them for information about their
commander.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely candidates for that role were Gen. Ratko Mladic,
who was the wartime commander of Serb forces in Bosnia, and Radovan
Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb political leader.
</P>
<P>
   Both men, who rose as proteges of Milosevic's, have been
indicted by the war crimes tribunal, for genocide and crimes
against humanity, but neither has been brought to the Hague,
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Mladic has lived in Belgrade for the last three years, and the
Clinton administration chose not to pressure Milosevic to hand him
over to the tribunal, because Milosevic had become the
administration's partner in the search for peace in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Karadzic lives in the Serb-controlled area of Bosnia, and the
Pentagon has long opposed any operation to seize him, fearing that
some U.S. soldiers might die in the operation or be subject to
attacks afterwards. While others in the administration, notably
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Richard Holbrooke, the
negotiator on Bosnia, argued strenuously for the NATO force to
seize Karadzic, Clinton sided with the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   But one senior U.S. diplomat in the Balkans said that failing to
seize Karadzic was seen by Milosevic as another sign of the West's
lack of resolve, and gave him the sense that he could act with
impunity.
</P>
<P>
   With the bombing of Yugoslavia and the atrocities in Kosovo, the
administration's view of Milosevic has clearly changed, and some
officials say this could make his indictment more likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether he's indicted as a war criminal now remains to be
seen, but there are war crimes being committed on the ground right
now, and those individuals who are committing those atrocities are
going to be held accountable,'' Secretary of Defense William Cohen
said Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' Cohen added, ``He's at
risk of being indicted as a war criminal at some point.''
</P>
<P>
   A State Department officials put it more bluntly: ``If we were
to turn to it now, we could have a lengthy, ringing indictment of
Milosevic in 24 hours.''

FIVE SETS OF BROTHERS ABOUND IN WINSTON CUP 
WITH CHART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Geoffrey and Brett Bodine have settled for
good will instead of bad blood.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers, both successful Winston Cup drivers, grew up in
racing together, fell from grace with each other in an ugly public
feud, then repaired their wounds. All in a sport that has
flourished on generations of family ties and sibling rivalries
throughout its existence.
</P>
<P>
   The Bodine brothers, who also include Busch Grand National
driver Todd, were one of five sets of brothers to race in
yesterday's Primestar 500. Remarkably, brothers make up nearly 25
percent of the field in every Winston Cup race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it brothers? It's because of the exposure we were part
of as kids,'' said Brett Bodine, whose grandfather, then father,
operated a small-town track during racing's formative years in
upstate New York. ``I am thankful my family elected to go in that
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Winston Cup brother tandems include: Kenny and Rusty
Wallace; Corpus Christi natives Terry and Bobby Labonte; Jeff and
Ward Burton; and Darrell and Michael Waltrip.
</P>
<P>
   The Bodines' luck at the Texas Motor Speedway yesterday did not
match that of the Labonte brothers. Dueling it out for much of the
race, Terry Labonte outran younger brother Bobby and Dale Jarrett
to win. Bobby finished third.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Bodine crashed on lap 140 and did not finish; Brett
never contended and finished 18th.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work together a little bit more than some guys,'' said
Terry Labonte, 42, who is seven years older than his brother Bobby.
``We actually get along, not like some other brothers in this
sport.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Labonte's statement is more innuendo than fact, but it
reflects the rifts that can evolve when a sibling is also a
competitive opponent. Winston Cup racing demands success to retain
sponsorship and ultimately your livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the Bodines infamously directed attention upon
themselves at the inaugural Brickyard 400. Late in the race,
Geoffrey passed Brett, who then nudged Geoffrey from behind and
sent him sailing out of Turn 4 and out of the race. Brett went on
to finish second.
</P>
<P>
   What occurred next set off a stinging war of words. On live
television, Geoffrey mentioned that he and his brother were not on
speaking terms and that it did not surprise him that Brett tried to
hit him. The explosive whirlwind that followed exposed a family
financial matter and a boiling sibling feud.
</P>
<P>
   News quickly spread that the Bodine brothers were enemies off
the track as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The documented incident with Geoff and I, which at that time
was the biggest race in NASCAR history, was that we had on-track
problems. Unfortunately, that brought out some issues that were
private family problems. On my behalf, it was not a problem with
me. I have never taken off-track things on the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were at odds for some time. I'd say for more than year.''
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the uncompromising crossfire of the tabloid-style feud
was youngest brother Todd, a former Winston Cup driver who races
exclusively on the Busch circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's \Rracing\S is all we've ever done. It's all we've ever
known,'' Todd said. ``It was tough. I was in the middle and was
still friends with both; it was a strange position to be in.''
</P>
<P>
   While the pressures attached to racing can drive a wedge between
loved ones in the sport, it can also serve as a bridge to bring
brothers together.
</P>
<P>
   The Labonte and Waltrip brothers have fostered strong and
supportive relationships since both joined the Winston Cup circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm his biggest cheerleader,'' Michael, who finished 14th
yesterday, said of his older brother.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Waltrip, 52, hardly knew his younger brother, now 35,
because of their age difference. In fact, the five sets of Winston
Cup brothers are separated by an average of 9.2 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're closer now than we've ever been. We weren't close at all
when he started,'' said Darrell, who finished 25th yesterday. ``I
was in my prime at the time and trying to take care of my own
career.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Bobby Labonte of brother Terry: ``We've always been close,
but I think \RNASCAR\S keeps us closer. A sad day for me will be
when Terry doesn't come to the racetrack, when he retires and I'm,
hopefully, still racing.''
Brother to brother Five sets of brothers race on the NASCAR Winston
Cup circuit, further extending NASCAR's claim of being a family
sport. A look at the brothers: Family/Brother, age/Car/Comment
Waltrip/Darrell, 52/No. 66 Big Kmart Ford/Three-time Winston Cup

   BRATUNAC, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ The young Bosnian Serb in a black
leather jacket had a message Sunday for the U.S. army peacekeeping
patrol moving slowly in their armored Humvees through his village.
His obscene remark cannot be restated here, but the intent can:
Yankee go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a problem before the air strikes. But now
people are very angry and upset,'' said Protaic Vojim, another
resident of Bratunac, a Bosnian Serb border village.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and NATO warplanes pounding Serbian targets in Yugoslavia
are having an unintended consequence in nearby Bosnia. The bombing
campaign is rattling the delicate peace here and making life harder
-- and riskier -- for the NATO peacekeeping contingent.
</P>
<P>
   Some 7,000 American infantry troops are stationed in Bosnia,
among 32,000 allied peacekeepers enforcing the 1995 Dayton Accords.
</P>
<P>
   Their position next door to Serbia already has made them targets
of reprisal by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and his Serb
forces. Two Yugoslav MiG-29 jet fighters were downed by U.S.
warplanes last Friday as the Serb jets strayed into Bosnian
airspace, presumably with the intent to attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned that whatever happens in Kosovo stays across
the river and does not ruin what we've achieved in
Bosnia-Herzegovina,'' said Lt. Col. Rich Totleben(CQ) American
commander at Camp Dobol, home to armor and infantry units from Fort
Hood, near Austin, Texas. Camp Dobol is one of five American bases
in the Bosnia peacekeeping zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will always maintain our right to protect ourselves,
whether it is a man on the street with a club or a MiG-29,''
Totleben said.
</P>
<P>
   In this dangerous part of the world, both the club and the MiG
pose equally troubling threats.
</P>
<P>
   At the street level in Bosnia, the side effects of the air
campaign were on display Sunday in the American sector, where
routine American patrols face increasing animosity and verbal
threats from the ethnic Serbs living in their zone.
</P>
<P>
   Since the air war began Wednesday, U.S. troops have experienced
intensifying hostility from ethnic Serbs in Bosnia, angry that the
United States is leading an air campaign against Serbs in
Yugoslavia, who live across a border only within sight of the
American sector here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 'middle-finger' factor has definitely increased since the
Kosovo operation started,'' said Capt. Scott Smith, a company
commander in the 1st Cavalry Division, referring to the gestures
greeting American patrols in ethnic Serb enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' he added, ``our presence here is provocative.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. commanders acknowledge the irony that NATO air strikes in
one part of the Balkans could disturb the long-sought peace in
another -- the Bosnian accord reached and maintained at great U.S.
expense after a brutal civil war between Bosnians, Serbs, Croats
and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   American peacekeepers patrol about one-third of Bosnia, with
daily convoys by heavily armed infantry platoons riding Humvees
through the rich farmland and bomb-shattered wreckage of the
four-year ethnic war that ended in 1995. The intent is to
demonstrate their forceful presence as a reminder to the former
combatants in the multi-sided Bosnia conflict that renewed violence
is not an option.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. commanders insist that their peacekeeping role in Bosnia
has not changed amid the air war against Serbia and that allied
defenses are strong enough to protect American troops.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Last week, U.S. forces in Bosnia went on a heightened state of
alert. Troops are now under orders to wear helmets and flak jackets
at all times, and to carry fully loaded M-16s while off the base.
</P>
<P>
   But the hard-edge of Serbian nationalism remains in towns like
Bratunac, Zvornik and Srebrenica, where combat and instances of
``ethnic cleansing'' by Serb forces in the civil war drove out or
killed Muslims, Bosnians and ethnic Croats.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the service-age Serbian men who helped carry out the
mass killings during the war, we're probably looking into their
faces every day in Bratunac,'' said Sgt. Archie Haynes, on
peacekeeping patrol Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the anti-Americanism has not turned violent, except for
the occasional stone thrown at a U.S. convoy, as happened Sunday.
But with the air war continuing, U.S. commanders are fighting a
perception among Bosnian Serbs that the peacekeeping force will
join the air assault and start to wage war against the Serbs in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the American peacekeepers say, the provocations come
from a small and radical minority of Serbs in their Bosnian patrol
zone. But, they add, a minority can inflict political and physical
damage should their verbal abuse evolve into acts of retribution
for the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Last last week, American soldiers described as a ``mini-riot'' a
tense stand-off between U.S. peacekeepers and a Serb mob. It ended
without violence, but some worry that a breaking point could come,
and with it an unraveling peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need compromise and peace from the United States, not
war,'' said Pavlovic Milali, 34, a Bosnian Serb in Bratunac.
``Otherwise the revenge will come from the people.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   The coastal storm which brought chilly, unsettled conditions to
the Northeast coast during the weekend will slowly move away
Monday. Clouds and patches of light rain will persist from Cape Cod
to the White Mountains. Most of Maine will be damp and cool.
Sunshine will return to the Middle Atlantic region and central
Appalachians with temperatures rising above seasonal levels.
</P>
<P>
   Despite high pressure off the Southeast coast, clouds will
spread into the Carolinas from the lower Mississippi and Tennessee
Valleys. A large, but weakening jet stream disturbance over the
western Gulf of Mexico will produce more showers and thunderstorms
from the Texas coast to the Mississippi delta. A fast flow above
15,000 feet will carry the moisture toward the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   Chillier air will rush into the Great Lakes behind a cold front.
Brisk winds from the northwest will gust over 35 miles an hour in
parts of Michigan. A few rain or snow showers are possible near
Lake Huron. High pressure building east from Nebraska will sponsor
sunny and pleasant weather across most of the plains.
</P>
<P>
   Low clouds will persist in central and western Texas as winds
from the east direct gulf moisture toward the southern Rockies.
Patches of drizzle are likely on the higher ground, including
southeast New Mexico. Bright and mild weather will dominate the
central and eastern Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain snow and coastal rain will be associated with a strong
cold front moving into the Northwest. Showers will reach into
northwest California, but most of the state will see sunshine and
temperatures will be more seasonable. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Dry Spell Ends &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The rains finally returned to south Texas this weekend. Through
late afternoon on Saturday, Corpus Christi had received only .85
inches of rain this year. Normally, this city should have had 4.46
inches after 86 days in the new year.
</P>
<P>
   A torrent came during Saturday evening with 2.07 inches falling
by daybreak Sunday. This shattered the previous record of 1.25
inches set 102 years prior. Suddenly, Corpus Christi went from a
serious drought to concern about flash flooding. The disturbance
which triggered the heavy rain will drift over the western Gulf of
Mexico perhaps bringing more rain on Monday.

   NEW YORK _ Out of symbolic modesty _ or maybe impatience _
Candice Carpenter took the subway rather than a limousine back to
her office from the Wall Street headquarters of Goldman Sachs
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   She was returning after watching the stock of iVillage, the
Internet company she co-founded, open for trading the day after its
initial public offering, quadrupling its initial price of $24
before closing at $80.125.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that got me excited,'' Ms. Carpenter said of coming
back to iVillage's offices at 170 Fifth Ave., ``was walking the
halls and seeing the kids so delirious that their hard work had
paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   During the next few months there are likely to be a lot of
delirious executives and employees as more than a dozen of New
York's Internet companies try to go public. The Mining Co., for
example, another prominent member of the group, saw its stock more
than double after shares began trading Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The offerings, of course, will create a windfall payoff for the
work put into these companies, with their young programmers and
producers holding options worth _ on paper _ tens of thousands, or
even hundreds of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the company founders who really have the right to be
delirious. Ms. Carpenter and Scott Kurnit, chief executive of The
Mining Co., each now have paper wealth of more than $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Along with financial rewards, the successful public offerings
come as more than a little vindication for Silicon Alley, the
collection of entrepreneurs trying to make a go of Internet
businesses in New York.
</P>
<P>
   They have had to fight harder for respect and for financing than
their Silicon Valley rivals on the other side of the continent. The
technology mainstream considered the New York companies too lavish
in their spending, too focused on content by writers and designers
_ and simply too far from Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind all that. The success of iVillage's offering
indicates that there are no hard feelings now between Silicon Alley
and the great wired masses of Internet stock buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, most New York Internet companies going public
are online extensions of the city's traditional industries. There
are media companies like iVillage, which provides women's services;
Mining, an Internet directory that relies on human guides, not
machines; and Star Media, an online service for Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   There are offshoots of Wall Street, including Wit Capital, an
online investment bank, and Multex, which distributes
brokerage-firm research. The advertising business is represented by
Razorfish, an interactive agency, and Media Metrix, a company that
measures the audience size of World Wide Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Companies in other New York industries, like publishing and
fashion, are spinning out online divisions. These include
Barnesandnoble.com from Barnes &AMP; Noble, the bookseller, and Iturf,
an offshoot of Delia's, a maker of clothing for teen-age girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York has become the center of the Internet content
business,'' said Fred Wilson, a principal with Flatiron Partners, a
venture capital unit of Chase Manhattan. ``People said that all the
technology plays and all the infrastructure plays have been done.
Now it's time for what you can build on top of the technology.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some companies going public here would be just as
natural in Silicon Valley, including Juno, an e-mail service
financed in part by News Corp., and Mapquest, which makes
electronic maps.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing to base in New York was ``a real gamble,'' said Kevin
O'Connor, chief executive of Doubleclick, an online advertising
network that went public in February 1998 and has a value of $3.2
billion, the most of any Silicon Alley company. After starting his
business in Atlanta in 1996, he considered moving to California,
but chose New York because ``we're a tech company and a media
company, but mostly a media company.''
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, as technology stocks plummeted and investors
shunned public offerings, many Silicon Alley companies feared they
would never achieve their goals of going public. But the dark days
lasted only a few weeks, and two small New York Internet companies,
Earthweb and Theglobe.com, went public in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than validation for Silicon Alley, the herd of public
offerings could simply mean that investors are so addicted to
Internet stocks that they will buy anything, even something as
improbable as a technology company based in New York.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Indeed, the iVillage offering went forward, at twice the
projected price, mere days after the company's former chief
financial officer accused Ms. Carpenter of overly aggressive
accounting. IVillage says it stands by its financial reports, which
were audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   ``IVillage is a lesson that the companies with the highest
profile in the media earn the highest valuations, even in the face
of accounting questions,'' said Alec Ellison, a managing director
of Broadview, a New Jersey investment bank. ``In the absence of any
rational metric with which to value a company, investors are
betting on the future, and that means image and brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are quick to caution that for any investor with a time
horizon longer than the life of a fruit fly, nearly all of these
companies are highly speculative. Even the biggest and most
established, like iVillage, are swimming in red ink with no clear
way to profits in sight. Some other companies are so small and
unproved that in earlier days they would have hardly qualified for
a bank loan, never mind a stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   Whether good for investors or not, the money flow benefits the
New York economy as some entrepreneurs apply profits from these
offerings to start new companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wealth is the next-generation seed capital that will be
reinvested in startups and will help strengthen the whole ecosystem
of new media in New York,'' said Brian Horey, a partner at
Lawrence, Smith &AMP; Horey, a venture capital firm, and a founder of
the New York New Media Association. ``Over the last 30 years, this
has turned Silicon Valley into an enormous economic flywheel.''
</P>
<P>
   For many of those at iVillage, though, the talk is less of
pushing that flywheel than of pumping money into the local economy
in different ways: buying an apartment, taking a vacation, paying
for a nice wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the first meeting where we talked about the
options, and they told us they might be worth a thousand dollars
some day if the company grew,'' said Kate Hanley, a producer at
iVillage since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were like, `Yeah, but we want a raise.' A lot of us had no
idea what an IPO was. Now, I've learned what a limit order is.''

 &HT;    MILOSEVIC: FROM AMBITIOUS APPARATCHIK TO STEELY DICTATOR
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON On a muggy June day in 1989, near a railroad junction
a half hour's drive from the Kosovo capital of Pristina, nearly one
million Serbs gathered in a broad mountain-rimmed meadow called the
Field of Blackbirds.
</P>
<P>
   There, 600 years before, Turkish invaders routed Serbs in a
battle that forever changed the face of the Balkans, opening
Europe's southern underbelly to the voracious appetite of the
Ottoman Empire.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't only Serbs who died on that field. Hungarians stood
with them, as did Poles and Albanians. They were part of an
international force of Christians, answering chiefly to Rome,
mustered to counter the growing reach of Islamic Turks.
</P>
<P>
   The horde that assembled ten years ago, however, came not to
praise the notion of ethnic diversity, but rather to bury it.
Presiding over the wake was an ambitious middle-aged Communist
Party apparatchik named Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Descending upon the masses by helicopter, like a rock star or
some lesser god, Milosevic held out a vision of redemption and
deliverance to those willing to believe that ethnicity was destiny,
particularly for Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kosovo heroism does not allow us to forget that at one
time we were brave and dignified,'' Milosevic admonished the crowd.
``Six centuries later, we are again engaged in battles and
quarrels. They are not armed battles, though such things should not
be excluded yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The world took little notice of this barbed expression of Serb
nationalism. It's paying more attention now.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' said Balkans historian Janusz Bugajski, ``was the
beginning of the end for Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, Milosevic, a tightly wound man with a fondness
for expensive French cognac and double-breasted suits, was elected
president of Serbia, buoyed by the violent waves of
ultranationalism he helped to foment.
</P>
<P>
   In the decade since then, with his influential Marxist wife
Mirjana Markovic at his side, Milosevic has led those same forces
on a bloody Balkan rampage that has left a quarter of a million
civilians dead along a swath extending from Slovenia through
Croatia, to Bosnia and the Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as U.S. and allied warplanes rip daily into the military
and economic underpinnings of his authoritarian regime, Milosevic,
57, is counting on his gifts for using the power of symbols and the
utility of myth to seize political victory from the jaws of a
battlefield defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic, if he knows he's going to lose the military war,
wants to win the propaganda war,'' said Bugajski, director of East
European studies at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, a Washington think tank. ``He wants to go down in history
as the savior of the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a sobering conclusion for U.S. policymakers. It suggests
that the Serb leader has every historical, political and personal
incentive for hunkering down to absorb a protracted campaign of air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   If his Serb forebears could attain martyrdom at the hands of
Turks with long knives, after all, Milosevic hopes to gain the
modern political equivalent, standing no less brave and dignified
against an onslaught of NATO cruise missiles and smart bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The historical template was a defeat, and it was bravely down
to the last man being willing to absorb that defeat rather than
accept compromise,'' said Jerrold Post, director of political
psychology at George Washington University. ``While it may be 600
years ago, it's like today to them. The past is present, and the
heart does not tell time.''
</P>
<P>
   In a culture that looks largely to its legends and tortured
history as the balm for a national psyche traumatized by a century
of turmoil, Milosevic may be the perfect tyrant.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the dawn of World War II to parents who would both
later, and separately, commit suicide, Milosevic seems to have
turned a personal persecution complex into something of a national
ideology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs are the victims of the latest holocaust in this
century,'' Milosevic told the Washington Post in a December
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``My duty is to protect the interests of my people and my
country,'' Milosevic said. ``If anyone has a problem with that, I
can only tell you that I am proud of my role in defending and
protecting the interests of my country, and my people.''
</P>
<P>
   To critics, though, Milosevic is a politically astute psychopath
leading a morally addled nation on a doomed mission to roll back
the tide of history with the blood of innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
   In an Oval Office address to the nation last week, President
Clinton described Milesevic as a dictator ``who has done nothing
since the Cold War ended but start new wars and pour gasoline on
the flames of ethnic and religious division.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks were aimed at explaining why he ordered U.S.
pilots to attack Serb troops who reportedly have killed more than
3,000 ethnic Albanians and run another half million more from their
homes during a year of repression in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, in his December interview, offers a reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Albanian narco-mafia gives money to foreign journalists
and politicians for the media war against us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire Western story of the Yugoslav crisis if false,''
Milosevic railed. ``This is the failure of journalism, moral
failure of journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic brooks no such shortcomings in his own country, where
the state-run media still dominates and journalists for independent
papers and radio stations are subject to fines, imprisonment or
worse for unflattering portrayals of his motives and moves.
</P>
<P>
   To those controls he combines an aggressive state security
apparatus to lock down political opposition and suppress dissent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is,'' said Bugajski, ''the last dictator in Europe.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In April, 1941, Belgrade fell to Nazi occupation after days of
bombing by Hitler's Luftwaffe. Four months later, Milosevic was
born in the provincial town of Pozarevac, east of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   His father, a theology professor, and his mother, a
schoolteacher, would later divorce. As a young adult, Milosevic
endured the suicide of his father and, years after that, his
mother, who was suffering from cancer.
</P>
<P>
   An economics graduate from Belgrade University, Milosevic scaled
a slippery career pole dominated by Communist Party machinations,
before turning his ambitions toward government.
</P>
<P>
   A quick study in politics and finance, Milosevic became one of
the youngest executives ever at Technogas, the state-owned company
that managed the country's natural gas purchases from the Soviet
Union. He quickly rose to become general director and five years
later he became president of the United Bank of Belgrade. He was 37
years old.
</P>
<P>
   To the Soviet contacts he'd developed in the gas business,
Milosevic added a Rolodex of banking sources from the West,
including many in the United States, which he visited as head of
the Belgrade bank.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he went into politics full time in 1984, heading the
communist party's Belgrade chapter, Milosevic seemed well equipped
to help a country struggling to negotiate the collapse of Soviet
influence and the coming primacy of Western capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   He soon turned his talents, though, toward other ends,
harnessing his personal ambitions to the powerful engine of Serb
nationalism, the enduring source of his authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind this facade of Serbian nationalism, this is not a man
with deeply held beliefs,'' said Post, who has studied Milosevic
extensively. ``His major goal is maximizing his own power and
surviving in power, and certainly not his dedication to the Serb
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is married to Mirjana Markovic, a Belgrade University
professor of Marxist sociology.
</P>
<P>
   Their daughter, Marija, runs a radio and television station in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Son Marko is a flamboyant child of privilege. In a state
impoverished by years of war, Marko flits about in flashy sports
cars and runs a Belgrade disco. On Saturday, as troops under his
father's command pressed their campaign of terror just south of
Belgrade, Marko reportedly signed a multmillion-dollar contract to
build an amusement park called ``Bambiland'' in his father's
hometown of Pozarevac.
</P>
<P>
   In a trend surely disturbing to U.S. policymakers, Milosevic has
seen his opposition wither in the days since NATO launched its
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic is more popular today than he's been since 1989,
when he first rose,'' said former U.S. envoy to Bosnia, Bill
Stuebner. ``Just as we would do, everybody's rallying around the
flag.''
</P>
<P>
   To anyone trying to read the mind of Milosevic, that would
suggest that he's not about to capitulate to continued NATO
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   With no sign that Milosevic might run up the white flag,
Stuebner, a Balkans specialist at the U.S. Institute of Peace, a
Washington think tank, posits a haunting question: ``Are we going
to keep it going until he dies of old age?''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The systematic ethnic-cleansing campaign against
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo appeared aimed at emptying the province
of the majority of its people and was on the verge of creating the
worst humanitarian crisis in Europe since the end of World War II,
NATO and American officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, NATO officials suggested that the air assaults
against the ethnic Albanians might not be enough to stop Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic from achieving his goal as his army,
police, paramilitaries and armed civilians continued to sweep
across Kosovo in a rampage of mass executions, torching of villages
and the forced exit to neighboring countries of women and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the brink of a major humanitarian disaster, the
likes of which we have not seen since the close of World War II,''
Jamie Shea, the spokesman for NATO in Brussels said Sunday morning.
The Yugoslav leader was trying to irreversibly clean Kosovo of its
ethnic Albanian inhabitants and, in the process, send them over the
borders to destabilize neighboring countries, Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO was in a ``race against time'' against Milosevic, Shea
added.
</P>
<P>
   Other NATO officials involved in military planning said Sunday
that constraints being imposed by NATO's civilian leaders were
limiting the air campaign hitting at the heart of Milosevic's war
machine. The NATO civilian leaders want to use ``gentleman's club
rules against a man who was practicing genocide,'' one NATO
military planner said.
</P>
<P>
   The civilian leaders had ruled out, for example, targeting the
Belgrade headquarters of Milosevic's military planners who were
orchestrating the highly organized ethnic-cleansing campaign in
Kosovo, the planner said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the prospect of Kosovo's being emptied of most of
the ethnic Albanians who make up more than 90 percent of the
province's nearly 2 million population, the NATO planner said,
``No-one can give guarantees that won't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   A former U.S. Ambassador in the Balkans, Peter Galbraith, who
was the envoy in Croatia, said Sunday that the current air campaign
might eventually cripple Milosevic's ability to wage war but could
leave Kosovo ``an empty square.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is he's accelerated greatly and we don't have a
way to stop it,'' Galbraith said. ``This will not be a triumph if
we've destroyed their equipment but Kosovo is empty.''
</P>
<P>
   Galbraith said he believed that NATO ground troops might be the
only way to counter Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   To carry out his scorched-earth policy, NATO said Sunday,
Milosevic has been using volunteers of Zeljko Raznjatovic, known as
Arkan, whose paramilitary fighters, the Tigers, were among the most
brutal in the Bosnia war.
</P>
<P>
   There they drove around in jeeps, executed people with pistols
and rifles and then looted their houses. By throwing Arkan's men
into Kosovo, Milosevic was making the task of NATO much more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   NATO aircraft can eventually target the 300 or so tanks that the
Yugoslav Army is using in Kosovo but it will be almost impossible
to target Arkan's men, armed civilians or other paramilitaries, a
NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
   In their public campaign to keep the support of the American
people behind the NATO air strikes, Clinton Administration
officials, including Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, talked on television Sunday
of Milosevic's stepped-up efforts at ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the lineup of American officials condemned Milosevic
as strongly as British Secretary of State for Defense George
Robertson, who spoke of the Yugoslav leader's ``murderous campaign
in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said that reports from ethnic Albanian refugees who
had escaped over the borders were enough to ``convince us that we
are confronting a regime which is intent on genocide.''
</P>
<P>
   At NATO headquarters, Shea described the sweep of Milosevic's
``scorched earth policy'' against the ethnic Albanians as being
provincewide, with ``wholesales ethnic cleansing'' taking place in
five towns. He named the towns as Lekovac, Podujevo, Srbica,
Malisevo and Dakovica.
</P>
<P>
   As an illustration that Milosevic's operations were not only
confined to the central Drenica area, which is the heartland of the
guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army, but encompassed the whole
province, NATO officials said that Serb forces were creating a
buffer zone about six miles wide along the Albanian border. This
was being accomplished by emptying and then burning villages along
that swath of territory.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days, 50,000 people have been uprooted from
their homes, making a total of 500,000 ethnic Albanian refugees
since the conflict started 14 months ago.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The determination of Milosevic to get rid of the ethnic
Albanians was demonstrated by the actions of his border guards at
the crossing with Albania, Shea said. The nearly 10,000 refugees
who had trekked into Albania on Saturday and Sunday were stripped
of their identity documents and those with cars had their license
plates taken.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups said they were continuing to receive grave
accounts of executions of whole families and of the separation of
men from women. They stressed again Sunday that it was still very
hard to verify the accounts, including those that thousands of
ethnic Albanians were being used as human shields at Serb military
installations.
</P>
<P>
   More precise information was hard to come by, a NATO official
said, because of technical difficulties in launching the Predator,
a spy plane specially developed to track atrocities occurring on
the ground. The plane, an unmanned aircraft, is capable of
transmitting video quality material of activities on the ground as
they take place.
</P>
<P>
   The Predator will not be airborne over Kosovo for ``another day
or two,'' the NATO official said. Other imagery from satellites and
high flying unmanned aircraft was being used primarily for
targeting and bomb damage assessment.
</P>
<P>
   There were continued reports Sunday of forced expulsions by
police from the Kosovo town of Pec, with neighborhoods there still
burning. These people were heading by foot or car, with few
belongings, to Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the refugees arriving in Montenegro said Sunday that the
Serb police in Pec had spread the word that the remaining ethnic
Albanian population there would be forced on Monday to board buses,
which would take them to the Montenegro border.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Sunday night that
15,000 ethnic Albanians had crossed into Albania in the last 24
hours and were being taken to the town of Kukes.
</P>
<P>
   There were no men in the group between the ages of 16 and 60,
and many young women were being kept behind in Kosovo, a spokesman
for the agency, Panos Moumtzis, said.
</P>
<P>
   In the capital, Pristina, several residents calling relatives
abroad said that families were being expelled from their apartments
and collected in the city stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed clear that Milosevic was continuing to target the
ethnic Albanian intellectual elite. Alush Gashi, the dean of the
School of Medicine in Pristina was executed, according to Bajram
Gecaj, the head of the Kosovo Crisis Group in London.
</P>
<P>
   The whereabouts of Ibrahim Rugova, the pacifist leader of the
ethnic Albanians for the last decade and of Vetan Surroi, a
prominent newspaper publisher, remained unknown. They were presumed
to be hiding.

<P>
   CHICAGO _ The flock turned out Sunday to pray for its pastor,
the Rev. Greg Dell, who faces suspension for officiating at the
union of two gay men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your ministry brought me back to church,'' one woman said
during Palm Sunday services, her voice trembling, as parishioners
held hands and offered prayers. ``This is a church where I could be
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   During the services, Dell stood at an altar lighted by a single
flickering flame and made it clear that he would not abandon his
view that homosexuals, who constitute about 30 percent of his
congregation, deserve full rights and privileges in the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not rest until God's family is affirmed in all its
diversity, in all its glory,'' he said. ``The church of Jesus
Christ will not be defeated.'' Someone in the pews shouted
``Amen.'' And then there was the sound of a muffled sob.
</P>
<P>
   ``God says don't forget who you are _ and whose you are,'' Dell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Loyal parishioners of Dell, 53, turned out at the Broadway
United Methodist Church here Sunday to pray, to sing, to weep and
to raise Cain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not feeling very Methodist today,'' a middle-aged woman
said with a glower during a meeting with Dell after services this
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to secede,'' said a man with a gray beard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Methodist church is telling us we're a leper colony,''
another man said angrily.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a jury of 13 Methodist ministers found Dell guilty by
a vote of 10-3 of disobeying the denomination's ``order and
discipline'' by performing a ceremony celebrating the union of two
men last year. He was suspended from his duties, effective in July.
</P>
<P>
   The jury said the suspension would be lifted if Dell signed a
pledge that he would never officiate at another such ceremony. But
he said signing such a document would run counter to his beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the service, parishioners stood in a circle
around the altar, holding hands, and offered their prayers. Many of
them spoke of Dell's battle with church authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the ecclesiastical trial and of his suspension, Dell
prayed for strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hear us, God, in the midst of our pain,'' he said. ``There are
going to be times when we feel lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The small brick church, situated in the heart of Chicago's gay
community on the north side of the city, was draped in a banner
fashioned by the pastor's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless Pastor Greg and Jade Dell,'' it read, referring to
the minister and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   People came here from churches throughout the Chicago area.
Supporters included at least one Methodist minister from another
church.
</P>
<P>
   On his way into the services this morning, Dell displayed a bit
of gallows humor. Noting that the pews were filled, he whispered,
``A trial really gets attendance up at church.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell's conviction is the first under a 1996 United Methodist
Church rule forbidding ministers to conduct same-sex marriages. The
United Methodist Church, with 8.5 million members, is the nation's
second-largest Protestant denomination, after the Southern Baptist
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   During a question-and-answer session with his parishioners and
other supporters, Dell said he would consider leaving the United
Methodist Church for another denomination.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, who has been a minister for nearly 30 years, receives a
yearly salary of $35,000 and a residence.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, in the only other trial to date held on the
issue, a Nebraska pastor, the Rev. Jimmy Creech, was narrowly
acquitted of disobeying church law after his lawyers argued that
the ban on officiating at gay unions was merely advisory and not
legally binding.
</P>
<P>
   The jury initially scheduled Dell's suspension to begin July 1.
But Jack Tuell, a retired bishop who acted as the judge in his
trial, agreed to delay the suspension until July 5, to allow Dell
to perform a wedding on July 3.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the gay men at Broadway United Methodist Church said
Dell had helped them find the path back to Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Samber, 48, who wore a dark business suit and a tie, said
most other churches make gay people feel unwelcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``You listen to the innuendo, the smart remarks,'' he said,
``and it's obvious you're not part of the flock.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would probably not be attending church if it were not
for Dell.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would say, `We are not here to tolerate you _ we are here
to celebrate you,' '' Samber said. ``That's powerful stuff, you
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Samber's partner, Darcell Windle, a retired banker, said Dell
helped people focus on the essential meaning of the gospels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disappointed,'' said Windle, describing his feelings. ``Just
very disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Heterosexual members of the church, meanwhile, said they could
not fathom why their pastor was being disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   ``God calls us to unity,'' said Dennis Stafford, 39, who works
in marketing for a blues nightclub. ``God's love is bigger than
race, gender or sexual preference.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments after services ended, a parishioner called out in a
forceful but tremulous voice to Dell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took until my 20s before a minister could look me in the
eye without saying, `You're evil and you're going to hell.' '' the
parishioner, Arlie Sims, 37, said.
</P>
<P>
   He smiled at Dell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of you,'' he said, ``there are Methodist kids all over
the country _ kids who thought they were the only ones _ who now
know that they're OK and that God loves them.''

 LILLIAN McMURRY, 77, BLUES RECORDER  
(lb) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lillian Shedd McMurry, who stumbled on a cache of old blues
records in 1949 and was so taken by the pure, haunting sound that
within a year she had opened a recording studio, died on March 18
at a hospital near her home in Jackson, Miss. She was 77 and, as
the founder of Trumpet Records, had been the first to record two
giants of the Delta blues, Sonny Boy Williamson and Elmore James.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said the cause was a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   It is a reflection of the way things were in the prewar South
that a white woman from a musical family could grow up moving from
Mississippi town to Mississippi town and never once hear the area's
most evocative music. She became an unlikely pioneer in an
unfamiliar field.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a reflection of the time and place that some of the
century's most original and talented musicians could perform for
decades, sometimes even on the radio, without being offered
recording contracts.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tribute to Mrs. McMurry's character, vision and love of
music and musicians that once she was exposed to the blues she
began making up for lost time, recruiting and recording many
leading figures, among them Willie Love, Big Joe Williams and Jerry
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Purvis, Miss., who had a peripatetic, hardscrabble
childhood, she became a state secretary in Jackson, Miss., took
some law courses and in 1945 married Willard McMurry, who
eventually operated several furniture stores, including one at 309
Farish St. in Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   While helping her husband clean out the Farish Street building
in 1949, Mrs. McMurry came upon a stack of old records. Curious,
she put one on a turntable and what she heard changed her life. It
was a song called ``All She Wants to Do Is Rock,'' by Wynonie ``Mr.
Blues'' Harris, and as Mrs. McMurry recalled years later, the sound
was as strange to her as it was thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most unusual, sincere and solid sound I'd ever
heard,'' she said. ``I'd never heard a black record before. I'd
never heard anything with such rhythm and freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McMurry was so taken with the music that she opened a
record department in the furniture store, specializing in blues,
gospel and other black music.
</P>
<P>
   The department proved so popular, especially after she began
advertising on the local 50,000-watt radio station, that it soon
became a full-fledged store.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year later Mrs. McMurry converted the store into a
recording studio and created the Trumpet label, initially recording
local gospel groups.
</P>
<P>
   Then after hearing about a blues singer who played the
harmonica, or harp as it is known in blues circles, she got in her
car, headed north and tracked him down in a small Delta town.
</P>
<P>
   He called himself Sonny Boy Williamson, and by the time Mrs.
McMurry found him, he had been performing for almost 20 years and
acquiring a devoted following through his regular radio appearances
on ``King Biscuit Time'' over station KFFA in Helena, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McMurry, who signed him to a contract in December 1950, did
not learn until years later that he was really Alex Miller, known
since childhood as Rice. Typically, Williamson had appropriated the
name of another highly regarded harmonica-playing blues singer, but
only, apparently, because as an escaped convict (the story was that
he had stolen a neighbor's mule and painted it white, and had
gotten away with it _ until it rained), he needed a different name.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, with Mrs. McMurry serving as a
demanding, inspired producer, he turned out a string of blues
standards, among them ``Eyesight to the Blind,'' ``Nine Below
Zero,'' ``Mr. Down Child,'' ``Mighty Long Time,'' ``Red Hot
Kisses'' (written by Mrs. McMurry) and ``Pontiac Blues,'' a
Williamson tribute to Mrs. McMurry's car.
</P>
<P>
   He also brought in his friend Elmore James, the slide guitarist,
whose first, and only, Trumpet recording, ``Dust My Broom,'' became
a major blues hit and led to a career with a succession of other
labels.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson remained loyal to Mrs. McMurry, perhaps partly
because she was a reliable friend who regularly bailed him out of
jail and gave him advances on his royalties _ more, in the end,
than he earned.
</P>
<P>
   A hard-drinking, cantankerous man who tended to get into fights
when he was drunk, Williamson, who carried a knife and a gun, also
used a lot of foul language, but according to local legend only did
so once around Mrs. McMurry.
</P>
<P>
   As the story goes, when Williamson began cursing at the studio
one day, she chewed him out and told him to leave. When he refused,
Mrs. McMurry, who had taken the precaution of making him check it,
pulled his own pistol on him, marched him outside and ordered him
not to come back. When he returned a couple of weeks later and
apologized, she took him back.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McMurry, whose husband died in 1996, is survived by a
daughter, Vitrice Rankin of New Orleans; a sister, Doris Wells of
Sealy, Texas; a brother, Milton Shedd of Jackson, and a
granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of unscrupulous competition from bigger record
companies, Trumpet folded in 1955, but the McMurrys eventually
managed to pay off its debts. (Always scrupulous about paying
royalties on time, Mrs. McMurry, who was inducted into the Blues
Hall of Fame last year, continued to make sure her former artists
got their due when collections of Trumpet songs were released over
the years.)
</P>
<P>
   Williamson landed at Chess records after Trumpet folded, but
continued to rely on Mrs. McMurry. After he died in 1965, it was
she who paid for his tombstone.

   ROCKET (Phoenix) The ``Rocket Boy'' of the Deer Valley School
District is quickly becoming a cult figure among space wonks around
the country. Thirteen-year-old David Silverstein, a seventh-grader
who was suspended for the rest of the school year for bringing a
homemade rocket to Desert Sky Middle School, has caught the
attention of scientists, a Ph.D. from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
and just plain folks who were surprised that school officials would
take such drastic measures. David's parents, who will home-school
their son, are in the process of appealing the suspension. The
matter likely will come up during an April 13 School Board meeting.
The groundswell of support for David began with former astronaut
Homer Hickam. Hickam's high-school interest in rocketry is
portrayed in the movie October Sky, which inspired David to build
his rocket. The youngster this week accepted an invitation from

   OHRID, Macedonia _ The separatist rebels in Kosovo are holding
out surprisingly well against an apparent major Serbian offensive
in Kosovo, despite losses and a shortage of ammunition, foreign
military observers here say.
</P>
<P>
   With reports of killings of civilians and with refugees fleeing
from Kosovo, there is also a serious military battle going on. The
1,400 foreign observers for the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, who had been sent in to help maintain the
former cease-fire, left before the NATO bombing began. Since that
time, Serbian forces apparently have concentrated on trying to
defeat the Kosovo Liberation Army, the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
   The government troops have reportedly pushed ahead with an
unexpected energy, apparently to try to gain an advantage before
the NATO bombing takes too great a toll on their forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The reports emerging from Kosovo indicate that fierce fighting
has been raging all over the Serbian province, in particular in
areas just north of the capital, Pristina _ around the towns of
Podujevo, Mitrovica and the heartland of rebel territory, Drenica.
Heavy fighting has also been reported around Dakovica and Suva
Reka, in southwestern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Civilians fleeing Kosovo into Macedonia Sunday said that
firefights had been taking place in the towns, including Pristina,
and Prizren, in the south.
</P>
<P>
   Agim Vinca, a philology professor at Pristina University, said
he escaped by car, his children crying in the back seat. ``All you
hear is the fighting,'' he said. ``If it is not the bombs, it is
the guns _ every moment, you do not know what is happening. It is
worse than hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbian forces have apparently succeeded in the last few days in
taking at least two rebel command centers _ Lapastica, near
Podujevo, and Likovac, in central Drenica. Journalists from the
rebel news agency, Kosova Press, say that the troops have been
using MiG fighter planes to bomb areas in Kosovo and have moved
more tanks into the areas evacuated by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   But the rebels say their commanders have so far evaded capture,
and the rebel group has continued its resistance, moving its
various headquarters and keeping the command structure intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their coherence has improved massively since last year,'' said
one military observer from the European group's Kosovo Verification
Mission, who maintained contact with rebel leaders even after the
monitors were withdrawn from Kosovo over a week ago. Members of the
monitoring group spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that they have lasted this long, that their command
and control is still intact, is proof,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have protected refugees to some extent, and have managed
to keep the Serbs off,'' he said. He gave as an example a situation
in central Drenica where the Serbian advance has reportedly come
within less than a mile of thousands of refugees in several
villages. He said that, based on conversations with the rebels,
they had delayed the Serbian advance by a week, winning some time
for the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   There were now signs that some parts of the rebel group are
breaking up their battalions into units of four to five men, and
sending them off on search-and-destroy missions against police and
army supply convoys.
</P>
<P>
   If the rebels adopt to this sort of classic insurgency tactics,
and even take the battle to the towns, it could serve as a painful
irritant to the government forces, the observers say. In the past,
the rebels have largely confined their activity to villages and
rural areas, while the government has maintained control of larger
towns.
</P>
<P>
   As Yugoslavia's forces are weakened by NATO bombing, and are cut
off from supplies and reinforcements from elsewhere in Serbia,
which is the main entity in Yugoslavia, they and the rebels are
likely to become more evenly matched, the monitors said. Then, if
the rebels manage to keep going, the two sides could arrive at a
stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels ``could never win, but a stalemate would be a
victory,'' one monitor said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Morale appears to be high among the rebels. The chief of staff
of the rebels, contacted by telephone Sunday, admitted losing some
territory, but immediately vowed to win it back.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels ``will fight harder to regain the ground they have
lost,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said the
rebel group ``is not losing the war and it will never lose. It will
continue the war until freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there had been heavy fighting around Suva Reka and
Prizren and that civilians were being forced out of the area.
</P>
<P>
   He said government forces were apparently forcing residents to
flee by burning villages to deprive the rebels of the support of
the local population, but also to depopulate Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians had been 90 percent of the population, so the government
could control it more easily.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign observers broadly agreed with his analysis. Serbian
forces are pushing from the north, clearing the area of both rebels
and the ethnic Albanian population generally, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are squeezing them down to the southwest,'' one of the
observers said, adding that authorities might be aiming for a
partition of Kosovo, in an effort to retain the north, with its
Serbian Orthodox monasteries and industry and mines.
</P>
<P>
   While the Serbs are proving successful at forcing the civilian
population to flee, the rebels were proving resilient, even though
under pressure and low on ammunition, the observers said.
</P>
<P>
   The main liability now for the rebels is the displaced civilian
population. They are reported to be desperately short of food in
some areas, and so their situation is restricting rebel activities,
and deflecting rebels from keeping up their fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The key over the next few weeks will be whether the ethnic
Albanians can get supplies in _ that is, food for the civilian
population, and ammunition for the rebel fighters. With 6,000 to
7,000 Serbian troops guarding the border, and a 10-mile stretch
cleared for the purpose, supply routes have been disrupted and
thousands of people trapped in the area, civilians may not be able

   WASHINGTON _ The systematic ethnic-cleansing campaign against
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo appeared aimed at emptying the province
of the majority of its people and was on the verge of creating the
worst humanitarian crisis in Europe since the end of World War II,
NATO and American officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, NATO officials suggested that their air
assaults might not be enough to stop Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic from achieving his goal as his army, police,
paramilitaries and armed civilians continued to sweep across Kosovo
in a rampage of mass executions, torching of villages and the
forced exit to neighboring countries of women and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the brink of a major humanitarian disaster, the
likes of which we have not seen since the close of World War II,''
Jamie Shea, the spokesman for NATO in Brussels said Sunday morning.
The Yugoslav leader was trying to irreversibly clean Kosovo of its
ethnic Albanian inhabitants and, in the process, send them over the
borders to destabilize neighboring countries, Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO was in a ``race against time'' against Milosevic, Shea
added.
</P>
<P>
   Other NATO officials involved in military planning said Sunday
that constraints being imposed by NATO's civilian leaders were
limiting the air campaign hitting at the heart of Milosevic's war
machine. The NATO civilian leaders want to use ``gentleman's club
rules against a man who was practicing genocide,'' one NATO
military planner said.
</P>
<P>
   The civilian leaders had ruled out, for example, targeting the
Belgrade headquarters of Milosevic's military planners who were
orchestrating the highly organized ethnic-cleansing campaign in
Kosovo, the planner said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the prospect of Kosovo's being emptied of most of
the ethnic Albanians who make up more than 90 percent of the
province's nearly 2 million population, the NATO planner said,
``No-one can give guarantees that won't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   A former U.S. Ambassador in the Balkans, Peter Galbraith, who
was the envoy in Croatia, said Sunday that the current air campaign
might eventually cripple Milosevic's ability to wage war but could
leave Kosovo ``an empty square.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is he's accelerated greatly and we don't have a
way to stop it,'' Galbraith said. ``This will not be a triumph if
we've destroyed their equipment but Kosovo is empty.''
</P>
<P>
   Galbraith said he believed that NATO ground troops might be the
only way to counter Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   To carry out his scorched-earth policy, NATO said Sunday,
Milosevic has been using volunteers of Zeljko Raznjatovic, known as
Arkan, whose paramilitary fighters, the Tigers, were among the most
brutal in the Bosnia war.
</P>
<P>
   There they drove around in jeeps, executed people with pistols
and rifles and then looted their houses. By throwing Arkan's men
into Kosovo, Milosevic was making the task of NATO much more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   NATO aircraft can eventually target the 300 or so tanks that the
Yugoslav Army is using in Kosovo but it will be almost impossible
to target Arkan's men, armed civilians or other paramilitaries, a
NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
   In their public campaign to keep the support of the American
people behind the NATO air strikes, Clinton Administration
officials, including Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, talked on television Sunday
of Milosevic's stepped-up efforts at ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the lineup of American officials condemned Milosevic
as strongly as British Secretary of State for Defense George
Robertson, who spoke of the Yugoslav leader's ``murderous campaign
in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said that reports from ethnic Albanian refugees who
had escaped over the borders were enough to ``convince us that we
are confronting a regime which is intent on genocide.''
</P>
<P>
   At NATO headquarters, Shea described the sweep of Milosevic's
``scorched earth policy'' against the ethnic Albanians as being
provincewide, with ``wholesales ethnic cleansing'' taking place in
five towns. He named the towns as Lekovac, Podujevo, Srbica,
Malisevo and Dakovica.
</P>
<P>
   As an illustration that Milosevic's operations were not only
confined to the central Drenica area, which is the heartland of the
guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army, but encompassed the whole
province, NATO officials said that Serb forces were creating a
buffer zone about six miles wide along the Albanian border. This
was being accomplished by emptying and then burning villages along
that swath of territory.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days, 50,000 people have been uprooted from
their homes, making a total of 500,000 ethnic Albanian refugees
since the conflict started 14 months ago.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The determination of Milosevic to get rid of the ethnic
Albanians was demonstrated by the actions of his border guards at
the crossing with Albania, Shea said. The nearly 10,000 refugees
who had trekked into Albania on Saturday and Sunday were stripped
of their identity documents and those with cars had their license
plates taken.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups said they were continuing to receive grave
accounts of executions of whole families and of the separation of
men from women. They stressed again Sunday that it was still very
hard to verify the accounts, including those that thousands of
ethnic Albanians were being used as human shields at Serb military
installations.
</P>
<P>
   More precise information was hard to come by, a NATO official
said, because of technical difficulties in launching the Predator,
a spy plane specially developed to track atrocities occurring on
the ground. The plane, an unmanned aircraft, is capable of
transmitting video quality material of activities on the ground as
they take place.
</P>
<P>
   The Predator will not be airborne over Kosovo for ``another day
or two,'' the NATO official said. Other imagery from satellites and
high flying unmanned aircraft was being used primarily for
targeting and bomb damage assessment.
</P>
<P>
   There were continued reports Sunday of forced expulsions by
police from the Kosovo town of Pec, with neighborhoods there still
burning. These people were heading by foot or car, with few
belongings, to Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the refugees arriving in Montenegro said Sunday that the
Serb police in Pec had spread the word that the remaining ethnic
Albanian population there would be forced on Monday to board buses,
which would take them to the Montenegro border.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Sunday night that
15,000 ethnic Albanians had crossed into Albania in the last 24
hours and were being taken to the town of Kukes.
</P>
<P>
   There were no men in the group between the ages of 16 and 60,
and many young women were being kept behind in Kosovo, a spokesman
for the agency, Panos Moumtzis, said.
</P>
<P>
   In the capital, Pristina, several residents calling relatives
abroad said that families were being expelled from their apartments
and collected in the city stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed clear that Milosevic was continuing to target the
ethnic Albanian intellectual elite. Alush Gashi, the dean of the
School of Medicine in Pristina was executed, according to Bajram
Gecaj, the head of the Kosovo Crisis Group in London.
</P>
<P>
   The whereabouts of Ibrahim Rugova, the pacifist leader of the
ethnic Albanians for the last decade and of Vetan Surroi, a
prominent newspaper publisher, remained unknown. They were presumed
to be hiding.

   WASHINGTON _ American and NATO officials, warning of genocidal
attacks against Kosovo Albanians, ordered up more air firepower
Sunday and took sharper aim at Serbian tanks and troops reportedly
waging a bloody campaign of terror that has displaced more than
500,000 ethnic Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the brink of a major humanitarian disaster in
Kosovo, the likes of which have not been seen in Europe since the
closing stages of World War II,'' NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said
Sunday in Brussels as allied warplanes began a new phase of
low-altitude raids against Serbian forces allegedly pursuing ethnic
Albanians out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced that as many as a dozen more U.S. planes,
including long-range bombers, would be added to the nearly 200
warships already participating in ``Operation: Allied Force,'' the
NATO bombing campaign to force Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to sign a peace deal ending ethnic strife in the Serbian
province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   And President Clinton, after consulting with his foreign policy
advisers and the leaders of Great Britain, France, Germany and
Italy on Sunday, urged NATO to ``persevere'' in stopping
Milosevic's ``campaign of inhumane violence'' against the ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, while leaving the White House for the presidential
retreat at Camp David, bristled at a reporter's question of whether
the bombings he initiated against Yugoslavia were driving the
atrocities in Kosovo. ``Absolutely not,'' he snapped.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said the flood of ethnic Kosovars streaming
across the border into Albania and Macedonia has increased
dramatically since the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia began last week.
They estimated that more than half a million have now been
displaced since fighting began 13 months ago between ethnic
liberation forces and Serbian troops and paramilitary gangs in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a systematic campaign against the Kosovo population at
large,'' Shea said of the refugees. ``We are seeing reports of
ethnic cleansing operations going on in a number of areas.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Even more alarming is that the majority of these
people are women and children. What has happened to the males
between the ages of 16 and 60?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confronting a regime that is intent on genocide,''
British Defense Minister George Robertson said in London.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth day of NATO bombing was accompanied by protests and
calls for a resumption of peace talks. In Moscow, anti-NATO
protesters scattered as police and gunmen exchanged shots in front
of the U.S. embassy after attackers tried to fire a grenade
launcher at the building.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II, in his Palm Sunday address, said, ``It is
never too late to meet and negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   And three liberal politicians from Russia, a country that has a
long history of ties to Serbia and whose leaders have been
outspoken in their opposition to the NATO air strikes, arrived in
Budapest for talks with U.S. Balkan envoy Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the situation continues in the direction it is going now,
we are confronted with a serious danger of the Cold War
re-emerging,'' former Russian Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar said
after the meeting with Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, NATO intensified its air strikes on Serb targets
Sunday, despite the loss of a F-117A Nighthawk stealth fighter jet
near Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, Saturday night. The
F-117A pilot was rescued and returned unharmed to Aviano Air Force
Base in Italy, the primary staging area for air strikes against
Yugoslavian forces.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon declined to identify the pilot. But news
photographs of the plane wreck showed the name, Ken 'Wiz'' Dwelle,
on the cockpit. Phone calls to the home of a Ken Dwelle near
Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, home of the lone F-117A
fighter unit, were not returned Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   In a wheat field outside of Belgrade, where the F-117A went
down, hundreds of jubilant Serbs rummaged through the wreckage of
the stealth jet Sunday, celebrating what they said was a victory
over NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Belgrade, thousands of defiant Serbs attended an
anti-NATO outdoor rock concert despite air raid sirens warning of
impending missile attacks. One of the signs at the concert read,
``Clinton: Serbia is not Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend was the 10th anniversary of Milosevic stripping
Kosovo of much of its autonomy, a primary reason for the current
conflict in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian radio reported the Yugoslav army shot down two NATO
aircraft over Kosovo on Sunday. But there was no independent
confirmation of the claim. Serbs have made a number of claims of
downing NATO planes since the alliance started its punitive air
strikes against Yugoslavia on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   With tens of thousands of ethnic Kosovars fleeing Serbian
forces, Albanian officials called on NATO Sunday to send in ground
forces to stop the reported atrocities. Refugees have told of
murders, door-to-door raids by Serb gangs, looting and burning.
</P>
<P>
   But Bratislava Morina, the Serb refugee commissioner, dismissed
such accusations as propaganda. ``There is no humanitarian
catastrophe in Kosovo whatsoever,'' she said on state-run Serbian
television.
</P>
<P>
   Although U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, in an appearance
on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' program Sunday, spoke of a
``bloodbath'' in Kosovo, American and NATO officials continued to
emphasize they have no plans to deploy NATO soldiers on the ground
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe that sending several hundred thousand
soldiers in to occupy Serbia for the next five or 10 years is the
right way to deal with this problem,'' U.S. National Security
Adviser Samuel E. ``Sandy'' Berger said on ABC's ``This Week''
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not considering at this moment sending forces on the
ground,'' NATO Secretary General Javari Solna echoed Sunday in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   But key U.S. senators left the door open to such action if the
NATO air strikes fail to force Milosevic back to the peace table or
to stem the carnage in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must win this conflict with whatever it takes,'' Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., said on ABC's ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, seemed to agree that ground troops might be necessary.
``I don't know . . . of any war . . . that's been won totally by
air power.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kansas, a member of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, told CNN that ``there is not any support for
(sending U.S. combat troops) in the Congress.''

VALDES SHARP, CONTINUES TREND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Right-hander Ismael Valdes gave up two runs
in seven innings. The nerve of him.
</P>
<P>
   OK, that's a little harsh. But it's symbolic of how well the
Dodgers' top three starters have pitched this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, who also struck out six without allowing a walk in a 3-2
win against the Atlanta Braves on Sunday, staff ace Kevin Brown and
Chan Ho Park have each flourished this spring.
</P>
<P>
   It is spring training, but the numbers are still overwhelming.
The three are 7-1 with a 1.47 ERA. Opponents are batting .211
against them and they've struck out 49 in 611/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The top three guys, I don't think you can throw the ball any
better in spring training,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
``Rocket (Valdes) was outstanding. He made one bad pitch. After
that he was really sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   That one pitch was a towering 425-foot homer by Chipper Jones in
the first inning. After that, Valdes was sensational, as he's been
all spring. And as the Dodgers hope he'll be when the season
begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm further ahead this spring than other springs,''
Valdes said. ``This is my first spring training that I've been
pitching well. I feel more relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Park said he got into form earlier in the spring because he was
active in the offseason, pitching in the Asian Games. Ditto for
Valdes, who is 3-0 with a 1.37 ERA. He pitched in his native Mexico
during the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Bullpen banter: Though no one is saying so, you can just about
scratch Chris Haney's name from contention for the left-hander's
job in the bullpen. Haney hasn't pitched since March 20 and he's
not scheduled to pitch in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Haney would have been utilized as a long man out of the bullpen,
but with right-hander Dave Mlicki relegated to the bullpen because
of the overloaded starting rotation, that role appears filled.
</P>
<P>
   It leaves lefties Greg Cadaret, Pedro Borbon, Onan Masaoka and
Jeff Williams fighting for one or two spots. Borbon could be in the
process of securing one of them _ he hasn't given up a hit in his
last seven innings _ but Johnson said a decision wouldn't be made
until the team traveled west.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some pretty good tests coming up,'' Johnson said.
``When we go and play Anaheim and the Yankees twice, you have to
have good left-handed pitchers to beat those clubs.''
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: Todd Hundley caught for the second time
in three days, going five innings and reporting no problems.
Johnson said he'll catch Hundley again Tuesday and Wednesday, his
first test in back-to-back games.... Right-hander Antonio Osuna
said he may make his spring debut Tuesday. He threw on the side
Sunday and reported that his elbow felt fine. He hoped to be ready
for the season opener, but said ``I think I'll start the season on
the disabled list.'' Osuna wants to be ready in two weeks....
Right-hander Mel Rojas threw 22/3 innings in an intrasquad game.
Johnson said he wanted Rojas to work on the side so he can get more
work. ``I wanted to stretch him out, to throw the ball down,''
Johnson said.

CONTEST AIMS TO BRING ACCORDIONS INTO THE '90S 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., N.J., Calif., La.)  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRANSON, Mo. _ Until her first year of high school, Terri Conti
lived a secret life. During the week, she was a typical New Jersey
teen-ager. But on weekends, Ms. Conti strapped on her accordion and
sneaked out to musical competitions.
</P>
<P>
   A math teacher finally blew her cover when she was in the ninth
grade, putting a newspaper article about a contest she won on the
class bulletin board.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this whole life in school, and then I would go to a
bowling alley a couple of nights a week and play in a big accordion
band with 25 or 30 other players,'' Ms. Conti said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Conti, 36, a part-time stockbroker, is no longer so shy
about her choice of instrument. She and more than 150 other
accordion players entered the national ``Hottest Accordionist''
contest that was held recently in this Ozarks resort city.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the contest was to find someone who could promote
the accordion to the MTV generation. Organizers said they weren't
exactly looking for the reincarnation of Lawrence Welk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't an age limit, but when you're asking for someone
hip and saucy, word goes out that you're not looking for older
people,'' said Faithe Deffner, president of the American
Accordionists Association.
</P>
<P>
   Players say the time is right for a squeezebox renaissance. They
point to an influx of accordion music in songs by such popular
performers as Sheryl Crow and Hootie and the Blowfish.
</P>
<P>
   The accordion is an attractive instrument because it is fairly
easy to play, said Ms. Deffner. She said most children should be
able to play a recognizable song after five or six lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the goal of the contest was to show how versatile the
accordion can be in current music. Players performed songs from
Louis Prima's ``Jump Jivin' Whale'' to Paul Simon's ``You Can Call
Me Al.''
</P>
<P>
   The instrument's image suffered in the 1960s, when things
electric were cool, and 1950s things _ such as Welk and his
accordion-flavored music _ were square.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rock continued to dominate the scene and the accordion wasn't
prominent in that music,'' Ms. Deffner said.
</P>
<P>
   Phoebe Legere, a semifinalist, believes that the accordion was
not sensual enough to keep the public's attention at that time. The
32-year-old New Yorker, who performed in heels and a skintight
white dress, said that was all a big misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The accordion hangs on the breast, right over the heart,'' she
said. ``It's an instrument that speaks to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the semifinalists in the competition began playing
before the age of 9 and all said they received a lot of support
from their families about their choice of instrument.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad said `I'll pay if you play,' and he's been paying ever
since,'' said 22-year-old Tim Padilla of Norco, Calif. He said a
competition accordion can cost around $16,000 and most players have
a few accordions of varied quality, weight and style.
</P>
<P>
   The contest winner, 20-year-old Dwayne Dopsie of Metairie, La.,
said that as a child he did not have much choice of which
instrument to study. His late father, Alton Rubin Sr., a popular
performer of zydeco music known as Rockin Dopsie, put a washboard
and spoon in his hand when he was only 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like Lawrence Welk Jr. I grew up believing the accordion
was hot,'' said Dopsie, who wowed judges with a purple suit,
fast-fingered style and James Brown-like dance moves.
</P>
<P>
   Dopsie took home the title, the promise of media exposure _ the
contest organizers hope to get him on talk shows _ and the right to
play with Myron Floren, accordionist with the Lawrence Welk
Orchestra, at the Polka Festival here in June.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Dopsie says his mission is to let young listeners know
there's more to the accordion than the polka.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make the accordion an everyday thing. I want to hear
on the radio pop and rock and rap and zydeco stations,'' he said.
``I'm going to go ahead and change a whole lot of minds.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not going to be easy, warned a fellow semifinalist, Jason
Stephen, who introduced his accordion to his Delta Chi fraternity
brothers at the University of Missouri at Kansas City. They were
taken aback at first, but eventually warmed to the instrument.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a normal college student,'' Stephen said. ``I listen to
the Beastie Boys and Beck. I just also play the accordion.''

 &HT;    Varied systems offer measure of stability control
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is probably more diversity in the methods used to
accomplish stability control than in the two technological steps
that preceded it, anti-lock brakes and traction control. Last week
I discussed the innovations that led up to it. Here is how it works
in several vehicles:
</P>
<P>
   From hands-on driving experience, I can tell you that the
performance and personalities of these systems are as varied as the
brands that carry them.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac offers StabiliTrak, which is an extension of the basic
traction control system, but it also utilizes yaw sensors to
determine which of the front brakes should have pressure applied in
order to keep the vehicle going forward. It is a basic,
non-intrusive system.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz, on the other hand, has its Electronic Stability
Program. It can sense impending loss of control at both the front
or rear of the car and momentarily apply the brake on one wheel to
restore stability. That is something even a skilled driver cannot
do.
</P>
<P>
   I found ESP to be one of the most aggressive systems. The
further the driver is in over his or her head, the more control ESP
is going to take. In typical Mercedes-Benz style, the system is
going to do everything possible to keep you from hurting yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo offers the industry's first duplicated system on its new
S80 luxury sedan. It has two yaw sensor control systems so that in
the unlikely event one fails, there is a backup.
</P>
<P>
   On a snow- and ice-covered road, I reacted faster than the
Volvo's system. When it activated, the car provided an unexpected
response. Then again, I do not consider myself a typical driver.
For a mother tending to her toddler, a salesperson talking on a
cell phone or any driver who is the least bit distracted, the
system should provide exactly what is called for.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most transparent and most driver-friendly system I
have tested is in the new Porsche Carrera 4. As a
performance-oriented driver, I hardly welcomed the installation of
a stability control system on a car like a Porsche. The idea of
some computer telling a Porsche driver how far he or she could hang
the tail out was offensive.
</P>
<P>
   But after a test drive on an autocross in pouring rain, I
quickly determined that I loved it. Sure, I could get the car
around the course with the system off, but it was more work, less
fun and slower.
</P>
<P>
   The Porsche PSM system may be the best stability control system
in the industry for two reasons: You really don't know it's helping
you out, and it comes on acceptably late in the process, allowing a
driver to believe that she or he is still in control. The fun is
not gone.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on your focus and needs, there is a wealth of
technological innovation available to make your driving experience
not only safer but even more pleasurable.
</P>
<P>
   However, as exciting as the new technologies are, none of them
gives license to drive with utter abandon. They cannot overcome
basic laws of physics. They are designed to help a driver who is
putting forth the best effort and using reasonable judgment from
becoming involved in a perilous situation.

 &HT;    BMW M Coupe speedy and sporty, but it's pricey
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best way to approach BMW's new M Coupe is with your eyes
shut and your bank account open.
</P>
<P>
   Get a salesperson or the owner of such a car to seat you behind
the compact leather-wrapped steering wheel of an M Coupe that's
pointed toward an open road or, better yet, a road course. It will
sell itself via its major attribute _ true sports-car performance _
before you realize the little speedster is plug-ugly.
</P>
<P>
   It's pricey, too. The upside is that the base price of $41,800
includes so many features that the only options are a power-tilt
moonroof for $300 and an in-dash CD player for $200.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid crowded malls and jammed-up traffic, though. The M Coupe
is so different from anything else BMW has built in recent years
and still so new that it's got an astronomical quotient for
inviting questions and thumbs-up gestures. It's not a car for those
times when you want to be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it's a car built for comfort, speed and agility. It'll
sprint with a Corvette (zero to 60 mph in 5.1 seconds) and stop
like a Georgia snow shower (60 mph to zero in 121 feet). Its
handling abilities challenge those of sports cars costing twice as
much.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Z3 line of fun cars built at Spartanburg, S.C., the
M Coupe gets its drivetrain from the BMW 3-Series machines given
the ``M'' designation after being tweaked by the German automakers'
Motorsports division. That means a quick-revving 3.2-liter engine
that delivers 240 horsepower at 6,000 rpm _ it will pull to about
6,800 rpm _ and 236 pounds-feet of torque at a utilitarian 3,800
rpm.
</P>
<P>
   Given that kind of grunt, the M Coupe is seldom caught with its
acceleration ability on the flat side. The five-speed manual _ no
automatic is offered _ shifts satisfyingly. The clutch can be testy
on start-ups, but that shouldn't be an ongoing problem for drivers
drawn to this type of car.
</P>
<P>
   The interior can startle the senses, because the two-tone
leather is keyed to the exterior colors, which include the test M
Coupe's bright Evergreen, Imola Red, Estoril Blue and Kylami
Orange. The headroom is better (37.8 inches) than the height (50.4
inches) suggests, and the interior is nicely cozy for two
medium-size adults. Because the M Coupe doesn't haverear seats, it
does have 14 cubic feet of cargo space.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a lot of looking and/or miles to fault the interior
design, and even then about all there is to criticize are drink
holders located too far back between the seats to be convenient and
some gauges low on the center of the dash. Otherwise, it's a nicely
laid-out cockpit with most everything easily located and operated.
</P>
<P>
   The ride will seem harsh to anyone accustomed to luxury-car
softness because of the sports-tuned suspension, but the enjoyment
of driving and riding in the radical-look M Coupe offers a quick
cure for that _ and for the desire to find a two-seat coupe with
performance and luxury in equally high measures.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 1999 BMW rear-drive M Coupe
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $42,670 (base: $41,800)
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual front and side air bags, anti-lock disc
brakes, switchable traction control system
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 3.2-liter six-cylinder engine with 24 valves (240
horsepower), five-speed manual transmission
</P>
<P>
   Options on test vehicle: power tilt moonroof, $300
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 19 mpg premium unleaded city, 26 mpg highway

 &HT;    Electrical system could be draining battery
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q:This thing about batteries is as clear as mud, I mean red
Georgia clay! 12.66 volts? Amperes? Cranking amps? Reserve
capacity? This is what I understand.
</P>
<P>
   A 36-month battery lasts two years. A 48-month battery lasts two
years. A 52-month battery lasts two years. Just sell me a battery
that will last five years! This whole thing is driving me nuts!
</P>
<P>
   _Bill
</P>
<P>
   A:Even I can get three years out of a battery. I think you need
to get your vehicle's electrical system diagnosed by a professional
mechanic, using proper equipment and diagnostic technique, not the
quick tester used in auto parts stores. Your driving habits could
be the culprit, but I strongly believe the problem is in the
electrical system.
</P>
<P>
   Q:I am a master mechanic with over 24 years of automobile repair
experience and have worked in the same shop since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Your latest articles about electrical system problems struck a
slight nerve with me. You pretty much stated that mechanics just
``guess'' at what's wrong when the car/truck won't start. We never
guess at what's wrong with a starting/charging system, and I was
offended to be grouped with a bunch of hacks that ``claim'' to be
mechanics. Too many times I've had to correctly repair the results
of these wannabes.
</P>
<P>
   My diagnosis has often found the root of many electrical
problems completely overlooked by these guys. For instance, three
new batteries installed by a national chain didn't cure the problem
caused by a bad cable.
</P>
<P>
   We have a large clientele of loyal, long-time customers and to
this day, not one has cast a bad vote about the service or the
quality of the work we do. So, I would like to maybe help you
understand that there are some good shops our there. ... Please
don't group all of us, good and bad, together.
</P>
<P>
   _Charles Emmons
</P>
<P>
   A: I certainly never meant to imply that all mechanics are from
the same mold. If I believed that, I would have bailed out of the
automotive profession years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Your letter actually supports what I have been preaching for the
last four years. Unfortunately, many consumers continue to
patronize the shops that promise the most and often deliver the
least.
</P>
<P>
   Commercials depict independent shops as dark dens of iniquity
where grease monkeys hang out. These boogey-man scare tactics
reinforce the stigma that has been attached to our profession, thus
fueling the public's preconceived notion of what mechanics are.
Money-saving coupons lure motorists away from independent shops
that neither can afford to nor want to offer cut-rate/cut-corners
service.
</P>
<P>
   Professional, quality mechanics all over the country have
cleaned up the mechanical messes created by these shops. To
compound the problem, we live in a state that requires no
credentials or certification of mechanics. Virtually anyone can
purchase a business license and profess to fix cars.
</P>
<P>
   The reason I support organizations like the Automotive Service
Association of Georgia, Automotive Service Excellence certification
of mechanics and the Georgia Advanced Emission Repair mechanics
certification program is to offer the consumer some viable
alternatives. I'm not promising perfection, only some aspect of
professionalism.

 &HT;    U.S. PEACEKEEPERS IN BOSNIA FEEL THE RISK OF THE AIR WAR NEXT
DOOR
 &HT;    600&AMP;add.
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-STRIKES-0329.
 &HT;    EDs: For purposes of a locator map, Bratunac is roughly
equidistant between Sarajevo and Belgrade and is on the Drina
River, on the border of Bosnia and the Serb republic.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRATUNAC, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ The young Bosnian Serb in a black
leather jacket had a message Sunday for the U.S. army peacekeeping
patrol moving slowly in their armored Humvees through his village.
His obscene remark cannot be restated here, but the intent can:
Yankee go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a problem before the air strikes. But now
people are very angry and upset,'' said Protaic Vojim, another
resident of Bratunac, a Bosnian Serb border village.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and NATO warplanes pounding Serbian targets in Yugoslavia
are having an unintended consequence in nearby Bosnia. The bombing
campaign is rattling the delicate peace here and making life harder
-- and riskier -- for the NATO peacekeeping contingent.
</P>
<P>
   Some 7,000 American infantry troops are stationed in Bosnia,
among 32,000 allied peacekeepers enforcing the 1995 Dayton Accords.
</P>
<P>
   Their position next door to Serbia already has made them targets
of reprisal by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and his Serb
forces. Two Yugoslav MiG-29 jet fighters were downed by U.S.
warplanes last Friday as the Serb jets strayed into Bosnian
airspace, presumably with the intent to attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned that whatever happens in Kosovo stays across
the river and does not ruin what we've achieved in
Bosnia-Herzegovina,'' said Lt. Col. Rich Totleben(CQ) American
commander at Camp Dobol, home to armor and infantry units from Fort
Hood, near Austin, Texas. Camp Dobol is one of five American bases
in the Bosnia peacekeeping zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will always maintain our right to protect ourselves,
whether it is a man on the street with a club or a MiG-29,''
Totleben said.
</P>
<P>
   In this dangerous part of the world, both the club and the MiG
pose equally troubling threats.
</P>
<P>
   At the street level in Bosnia, the side effects of the air
campaign were on display Sunday in the American sector, where
routine American patrols face increasing animosity and verbal
threats from the ethnic Serbs living in their zone.
</P>
<P>
   Since the air war began Wednesday, U.S. troops have experienced
intensifying hostility from ethnic Serbs in Bosnia, angry that the
United States is leading an air campaign against Serbs in
Yugoslavia, who live across a border only within sight of the
American sector here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 'middle-finger' factor has definitely increased since the
Kosovo operation started,'' said Capt. Scott Smith, a company
commander in the 1st Cavalry Division, referring to the gestures
greeting American patrols in ethnic Serb enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' he added, ``our presence here is provocative.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. commanders acknowledge the irony that NATO air strikes in
one part of the Balkans could disturb the long-sought peace in
another -- the Bosnian accord reached and maintained at great U.S.
expense after a brutal civil war between Bosnians, Serbs, Croats
and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   American peacekeepers patrol about one-third of Bosnia, with
daily convoys by heavily armed infantry platoons riding Humvees
through the rich farmland and bomb-shattered wreckage of the
four-year ethnic war that ended in 1995. The intent is to
demonstrate their forceful presence as a reminder to the former
combatants in the multi-sided Bosnia conflict that renewed violence
is not an option.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. commanders insist that their peacekeeping role in Bosnia
has not changed amid the air war against Serbia and that allied
defenses are strong enough to protect American troops.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Last week, U.S. forces in Bosnia went on a heightened state of
alert. Troops are now under orders to wear helmets and flak jackets
at all times, and to carry fully loaded M-16s while off the base.
</P>
<P>
   But the hard-edge of Serbian nationalism remains in towns like
Bratunac, Zvornik and Srebrenica, where combat and instances of
``ethnic cleansing'' by Serb forces in the civil war drove out or
killed Muslims, Bosnians and ethnic Croats.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the service-age Serbian men who helped carry out the
mass killings during the war, we're probably looking into their
faces every day in Bratunac,'' said Sgt. Archie Haynes, on
peacekeeping patrol Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the anti-Americanism has not turned violent, except for
the occasional stone thrown at a U.S. convoy, as happened Sunday.
But with the air war continuing, U.S. commanders are fighting a
perception among Bosnian Serbs that the peacekeeping force will
join the air assault and start to wage war against the Serbs in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the American peacekeepers say, the provocations come
from a small and radical minority of Serbs in their Bosnian patrol
zone. But, they add, a minority can inflict political and physical
damage should their verbal abuse evolve into acts of retribution
for the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Last last week, American soldiers described as a ``mini-riot'' a
tense stand-off between U.S. peacekeepers and a Serb mob. It ended
without violence, but some worry that a breaking point could come,
and with it an unraveling peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need compromise and peace from the United States, not
war,'' said Pavlovic Milali, 34, a Bosnian Serb in Bratunac.
``Otherwise the revenge will come from the people.''

   BRATUNAC, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ The young Bosnian Serb in a black
leather jacket had a message Sunday for the U.S. army peacekeeping
patrol moving slowly in their armored Humvees through his village.
His obscene remark cannot be restated here, but the intent can:
Yankee go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a problem before the air strikes. But now
people are very angry and upset,'' said Protaic Vojim, another
resident of Bratunac, a Bosnian Serb border village.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and NATO warplanes pounding Serbian targets in Yugoslavia
are having an unintended consequence in nearby Bosnia. The bombing
campaign is rattling the delicate peace here and making life harder
-- and riskier -- for the NATO peacekeeping contingent.
</P>
<P>
   Some 7,000 American infantry troops are stationed in Bosnia,
among 32,000 allied peacekeepers enforcing the 1995 Dayton Accords.
</P>
<P>
   Their position next door to Serbia already has made them targets
of reprisal by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and his Serb
forces. Two Yugoslav MiG-29 jet fighters were downed by U.S.
warplanes last Friday as the Serb jets strayed into Bosnian
airspace, presumably with the intent to attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned that whatever happens in Kosovo stays across
the river and does not ruin what we've achieved in
Bosnia-Herzegovina,'' said Lt. Col. Rich Totleben(CQ) American
commander at Camp Dobol, home to armor and infantry units from Fort
Hood, near Austin, Texas. Camp Dobol is one of five American bases
in the Bosnia peacekeeping zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will always maintain our right to protect ourselves,
whether it is a man on the street with a club or a MiG-29,''
Totleben said.
</P>
<P>
   In this dangerous part of the world, both the club and the MiG
pose equally troubling threats.
</P>
<P>
   At the street level in Bosnia, the side effects of the air
campaign were on display Sunday in the American sector, where
routine American patrols face increasing animosity and verbal
threats from the ethnic Serbs living in their zone.
</P>
<P>
   Since the air war began Wednesday, U.S. troops have experienced
intensifying hostility from ethnic Serbs in Bosnia, angry that the
United States is leading an air campaign against Serbs in
Yugoslavia, who live across a border only within sight of the
American sector here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 'middle-finger' factor has definitely increased since the
Kosovo operation started,'' said Capt. Scott Smith, a company
commander in the 1st Cavalry Division, referring to the gestures
greeting American patrols in ethnic Serb enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' he added, ``our presence here is provocative.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. commanders acknowledge the irony that NATO air strikes in
one part of the Balkans could disturb the long-sought peace in
another -- the Bosnian accord reached and maintained at great U.S.
expense after a brutal civil war between Bosnians, Serbs, Croats
and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   American peacekeepers patrol about one-third of Bosnia, with
daily convoys by heavily armed infantry platoons riding Humvees
through the rich farmland and bomb-shattered wreckage of the
four-year ethnic war that ended in 1995. The intent is to
demonstrate their forceful presence as a reminder to the former
combatants in the multi-sided Bosnia conflict that renewed violence
is not an option.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. commanders insist that their peacekeeping role in Bosnia
has not changed amid the air war against Serbia and that allied
defenses are strong enough to protect American troops.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Last week, U.S. forces in Bosnia went on a heightened state of
alert. Troops are now under orders to wear helmets and flak jackets
at all times, and to carry fully loaded M-16s while off the base.
</P>
<P>
   But the hard-edge of Serbian nationalism remains in towns like
Bratunac, Zvornik and Srebrenica, where combat and instances of
``ethnic cleansing'' by Serb forces in the civil war drove out or
killed Muslims, Bosnians and ethnic Croats.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the service-age Serbian men who helped carry out the
mass killings during the war, we're probably looking into their
faces every day in Bratunac,'' said Sgt. Archie Haynes, on
peacekeeping patrol Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the anti-Americanism has not turned violent, except for
the occasional stone thrown at a U.S. convoy, as happened Sunday.
But with the air war continuing, U.S. commanders are fighting a
perception among Bosnian Serbs that the peacekeeping force will
join the air assault and start to wage war against the Serbs in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the American peacekeepers say, the provocations come
from a small and radical minority of Serbs in their Bosnian patrol
zone. But, they add, a minority can inflict political and physical
damage should their verbal abuse evolve into acts of retribution
for the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Last last week, American soldiers described as a ``mini-riot'' a
tense stand-off between U.S. peacekeepers and a Serb mob. It ended
without violence, but some worry that a breaking point could come,
and with it an unraveling peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need compromise and peace from the United States, not
war,'' said Pavlovic Milali, 34, a Bosnian Serb in Bratunac.
``Otherwise the revenge will come from the people.''

   LOS ANGELES _ It's tough deciding what you'd like your automatic
start-up page to pop up as when you launch into the Internet. So
try this one for a while _ KFWB sports reporter Joe McDonnell has
overhauled his web site (www.la-sports.com) with a nice, clean
presentation to replace his former Big Nasty home.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to providing a place for McDonnell's daily rants, it
includes links to just about anywhere else you'll end up going _
local teams, national sports services, 34 newspapers and 29
columnists. There's also links to his own favorite sites, which of
course include his current employer (http://www.kfwb.com).
</P>
<P>
   There's also a quick scroll of the day's scores, a chat room and
an instant poll.
</P>
<P>
   That was simple. What else do you need?
</P>
<P>
   Read the lame explanation for how Duke University came up with
Blue Devils as its nickname on the school's official athletic site
(http://www.goduke.com).
</P>
<P>
   The Women's World Cup '99 site (http://wwc99.fifa.com) does a
nice job covering all the countries involved and spotlighting key
players. And, of course, providing local ticket info.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Giants are working on an idea that will allow
season-ticket holders to sell seats they can't use via the Internet
as late as game day, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Which should soon introduce a new phrase: Cyberscalping. &QL;

   TUSTIN, Calif. _ No one knows for sure how many there are.
Hoping to close them before more babies die, a police officer says
it is almost impossible to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like counting the speak-easies in Chicago in the 1920s,''
the officer said. ``They don't advertise in the Yellow Pages.''
</P>
<P>
   They are unlicensed makeshift pharmacies and clinics, dispensing
from the back room of the corner butcher or gift shop or
mom-and-pop bodega the promise of help and health that even a poor
family can afford.
</P>
<P>
   They cater to Southern California's huge and often uninsured
immigrant population, which turns to this underground health care
system, experts say, because of poverty, fear of deportation and
old habits brought to the new country.
</P>
<P>
   Within the last year, two toddlers in Orange County have died
after receiving back-room injections. The most recent child to die
_ the most recent one that the authorities know about, at any rate
_ was 18-month-old Selene Segura Rios, born in the United States
and the first American citizen in her family.
</P>
<P>
   Selene died on Feb. 22, two hours after a clerk in a Tustin gift
shop, Los Hermanos, gave her a $37 injection of illegally imported
drugs. The syringe was supposed to be filled with penicillin but
the authorities are not sure what it contained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically have a child with the flu who is suddenly dead,''
said Lt. Michael Shanahan of the Tustin Police. ``What we're
waiting to find out is do we have a murder?''
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old clerk, who had no medical training or
credentials, was arrested the next day but released, pending the
outcome of toxicology tests.
</P>
<P>
   The baby's uninsured parents took her to the gift shop on the
advice of a friend. He told them that lots of people took their
children there. That was the word on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parents are devastated,'' Shanahan said. ``All they were
trying to do was help their daughter get over a cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Police and health department officials in Los Angeles County and
next door in Orange County, where Los Hermanos now sits locked, say
that the bogus pharmacies are widespread in struggling
neighborhoods with large immigrant populations.
</P>
<P>
   The pharmacies are especially popular in Latino immigrant
neighborhoods, where the lack of health insurance is especially
prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   Both counties have set up special task forces to find the
clinics and shut them down and to educate the public about the
dangers and the alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Since last June, Los Angeles County authorities have conducted
nearly 160 raids of back-room pharmacies, seizing $2-million worth
of medication and arresting more than 50 people.
</P>
<P>
   The public education part is harder, officials say, because for
many poor people, the practical side wins out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid what we're seeing now is the proverbial tip of the
iceberg,'' said E. Richard Brown, director of the Center for Health
Policy Research at the University of California at Los Angeles.
``I'm afraid there are a lot of people risking their health and
even their lives by going to these places, largely because they
don't have health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 7 million people in California without health
insurance, Brown said, including 2 million children. He said that
California had the largest number of uninsured people in the
country and one of the highest rates of uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   In the city of Los Angeles, 39 percent of all people under age
65 are uninsured, and 71 percent of uninsured workers are employed
by businesses that offer no health insurance at all. Brown said
statistics show that Latinos are more likely than any other group
to work for employers who do not provide coverage.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the Latino Coalition for a Healthy California
in San Francisco estimated that 9 out of 10 uninsured Latinos were
in working families.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition also found that 35 percent of nonelderly Latinos
statewide are uninsured. For Latino noncitizen immigrants, the rate
is 52 percent, which is three times the rate for citizens, even
though 86 percent of Latino noncitizen immigrants are in working
families, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of insurance is only one reason people use the clinics. In
rural areas of Mexico and other countries, it is not uncommon to
buy prescription drugs at a gift shop or a bodega, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using the back-room pharmacies is not tradition or culture,
it's habit,'' said Mary Watson, executive director of the Free
Health Plan, a licensed clinic in Santa Ana. ``They don't think the
clinics are doing anything illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Many immigrants also risk their health, experts say, because
they are afraid of risking their chance at a better life in the
United States. They are afraid that if they apply for government
health programs for themselves or their children that they will be
targets for deportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are afraid of using the system and being labeled
`welferieros,' which they are afraid could hurt their chances at
citizenship,'' said America Bracho of Latino Health Access in
Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   Bracho said ``years and years of hatred'' in California toward
Latinos, from legislation restricting immigrant access to public
health services and school programs to the ban on bilingual
education, had chased many Latinos into the back rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I don't think people are aware of the risks,'' she said.
``They say to themselves that this fever or pain will go away after
an injection or a few bills. For them, the real risk is not to
offer a better future for their kids.''

TV'S GREATEST CHARACTER? HOMER SIMPSON (D'OH!) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The day after the debut of Matt Groening's new animated series,
``Futurama,'' is as good a time as any to say something about his
previous one:
</P>
<P>
   Homer Simpson is the greatest television character of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``D'oh!'' you say. Homer is an overweight, underachieving tub of
goo who keeps his family together (barely) more in spite of his
efforts than because of them. The man is no role model; instead, he
is a pathetic, self-centered cretin.
</P>
<P>
   Well yeah, exactly. Which makes him come off a lot more like a
regular guy than Dr. Cliff Huxtable ever did.
</P>
<P>
   So forget Lucy, no matter how much you love her. Felix and Oscar
are the odd men out. Seinfeld signed off two years too late, a
shell of his former Seinself.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after 10 seasons, Homer keeps plugging away. He's as
hapless, hilarious and hopelessly romantic (in his own inimitable
way) as ever.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that Homer has his shortcomings. This is a man, after
all, who once gained 61 pounds so as to become morbidly obese,
thereby qualifying as disabled and allowed to work at home.
</P>
<P>
   This is also a man who, not wanting to go to church one Sunday,
established his own religion. (Waffles and professional football
were involved, as well as an unsuccessful effort to recruit Moe:
``Sorry, Homer. Once a snake-handler, always a snake-handler.'')
</P>
<P>
   And yes, this is a man who invented the Lazy Man Reclining
Toilet Chair.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just one side of Homer, the side his critics latch on
to. Sure, he did all those things. But as ever, there is more to
the story.
</P>
<P>
   Homer got fat, but he also saved Springfield from certain
nuclear disaster (``you turned a potential Chernobyl into a mere
Three Mile Island'') because of his hard-won girth.
</P>
<P>
   He had his new religion approved, more or less, by God himself.
</P>
<P>
   And the Lazy Man Reclining Toilet Chair . . . well, no one is
perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we all have our own favorite TV character, and any
such claim unleashes a wave of nostalgia. That Matt Dillon, he
walked tall, some will say. He embodied all that's right about
'Merica. Little Joe Cartright was the soul of ``Bonanza'' and the
Old West, and a handsome devil, to boot. Hawkeye Pierce spoke for
all men everywhere in the late '70s and early '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Please. Go back and watch some reruns before you make your
arguments. ``Gunsmoke''was a fine show, but Marshal Dillon was a
cardboard caricature of the Old West sheriff. Little Joe was just
the first (though, admittedly, the least overdone) step in Michael
Landon's maudlin progression toward angel status, which he achieved
in ``Highway to Heaven.'' Like ``MASH,'' Hawkeye started out great;
by the time the show's run mercifully ended, he was an emasculated,
sanctimonious bag of politically correct wind.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, Homer, despite the occasional stab at self-improvement,
doesn't change much.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes him all the more realistic. He remains true to
himself, even if that self is less than appealing. Let's face it,
the reason Homer is the best character television has yet produced
is because, no matter whether you want to admit it, he's the most
like us.
</P>
<P>
   Who among us hasn't failed our spouses, our kids, our employers
in some way, large or small? Who hasn't taken the selfish route?
Who hasn't bought a life-size dummy and thrown it over a deadly
waterfall in front of co-workers in a ruse to get the day off and
then spent it lying in a hammock?
</P>
<P>
   Wait, forget that last one. Anyway, sure, Homer's
characteristics and foibles are exaggerated, but that's TV. (See
``ER,'' `` The Brady Bunch'' and Berle, Milton, for further
examples.) And in the end, his love for his family always wins out.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say we should emulate a guy who offers to his
son ``three little sentences that will get you through life _ No.
1: Cover for me. No. 2: Oh, good idea, boss! No. 3: It was like
that when I got here.''
</P>
<P>
   Just that we should enjoy him. &QL;

 TUSTIN: their kids.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So they go to places like Los Hermanos.
</P>
<P>
   Baby Selene had been sick with a cold for about 48 hours. Her
parents treated her with over-the-counter medication, but the cold
seemed to be getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   The parents did not have health insurance but they made sure
that Selene and her 4-year-old brother had a regular doctor. But by
the time Selene's father got home from his construction job on Feb.
22 at 6 p.m., the doctor's office was closed.
</P>
<P>
   Then he remembered that a friend had told them about a gift shop
in Tustin, 20 minutes from their home in Anaheim, where they could
take Selene for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   It was just a cold.
</P>
<P>
   When the family arrived at the gift shop, Shanahan said, they
asked to see the doctor and were taken into the back room. A woman
examined the child and reported that she had a fever and needed an
injection. The woman said everything would be all right.
</P>
<P>
   The charge was $37.
</P>
<P>
   When the family returned home, they realized Selene was not
getting any better, and at 8 p.m. she ``was having something like a
seizure,'' Shanahan said.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents scooped her up and ran to the emergency room at
Anaheim Memorial Medical Center, across the street from their home.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors tried to revive her, but it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan said the father told investigators that he thought the
woman in the gift shop was a doctor. He also told them that if they
had taken Selene to the emergency room in the beginning they would
have run up an expensive bill.
</P>
<P>
   It was just a cold.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, as the police shut down Los Hermanos and carted
away hundreds of packages of unlicensed medication from the back
room, Shanahan said, ``all we saw was women and young children with
running noses coming to the store to see the doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan said that the shop opened in 1997 and was licensed to
sell toys, greeting cards and other similar items. But hundreds of
people also went there to buy unlicensed prescription medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place was very busy,'' the lieutenant said. ``Some of the
employees we talked to said they were giving dozens of shots every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   In the raids since last June, the authorities in Los Angeles
County have targeted gift shops, grocery stores, garages and
private homes, where unlicensed medication was being sold and
unlicensed treatment, from dentistry to prenatal care to plastic
surgery, was being offered.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have confiscated more than $2 million in
unlicensed medications, much of it brought from Mexico and Central
America in a prescription drug pipeline that federal
law-enforcement agencies are investigating. Many of the seized
drugs are banned in the United States. Some of the drugs had
expired and some had been stuffed into the wrong packages.
</P>
<P>
   And many of the drugs seized can be sold legally only with a
doctor's prescription, like Viagra, Valium and penicillin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these places are better stocked than a chain drug
store,'' said Gregory Thompson, a pharmacist with the County
Department of Health Services, who goes on many of the raids to
identify unlicensed medications.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the more than 50 people arrested, including a Russian
immigrant and, the other day, three Chinese immigrants in a store
selling herbs in Chinatown, have been charged with misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a team of Los Angeles County public health officers
and deputy sheriffs raided a weary-looking house in the middle of a
weary-looking block in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   They came out of the house with several large plastic bags
filled with unlicensed medications, including the same kinds of
vials of penicillin that Selene was said to have gotten her
injection from.
</P>
<P>
   They also came out with several thousand dollars in cash. The
house was apparently a makeshift pediatric clinic doing a brisk
business.
</P>
<P>
   The word on the street is that the back-room pharmacies are
cheaper than even the licensed health clinics set up for the poor.
That is not true, Ms. Hamai said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these businesses,'' she said, ``are raising their
prices sometimes up to five times the amount they would get from a
real clinic.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Pontanillo, 49, used to buy his diabetes medicine from a
back-room pharmacy before he started seeing a doctor at a hospital
clinic. Still, Pontanillo swears that buying the medicine in the
back room was at least half as expensive as going to a regular
clinic. He collects cardboard for recycling and after 10 to 12
hours on the streets, he might take home $35.
</P>
<P>
   If he has to stop going to the hospital clinic, he said, he will
return to the back rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will have no choice,'' Pontanillo said. ``I am a poor man
and this is an expensive disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Salinas, 34, buys medicine at a Santa Ana gift shop when
he feels he has to. He makes his living painting and cleaning
apartments, and for him, dimes are like dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Like Pontanillo, he has no health insurance, but his four
children do. He bought some flu medicine from a back room for his
wife, and she got ``very sick and now only takes medicine with a
prescription,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He went to a regular doctor once for a bad cough, he said, and
it cost him $120, which is almost half his weekly pay.
</P>
<P>
   When he gets sick, he prays the illness will go away. When he
gets really sick, he goes to the back room.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not enough clinics for all the poor people,''
Salinas said. ``That is why we go to the gift shops.''

SERBIA USES TV TO ATTACK NATO POLICY

<P>
   For Serbs watching government-controlled Serbian television, the
world of the Balkans is not complex and conflicted, but crystal
clear: NATO attacked Serbia because of a longstanding criminal
conspiracy by the West. Ethnic Albanians in Kosovo are terrorists.
And Serbia, above all, will fight to the last man.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing in doubt, as the somber-suited men and women of
the Serbian evening news say repeatedly, is the eventual
``international recognition of our just cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Such, at least, is the picture that emerges from a 29-minute
excerpt from Serbian television that was broadcast on March 25,
shortly after the start of the NATO air campaign, and repeated the
same evening on C-SPAN, the U.S. cable channel, with an English
translation.
</P>
<P>
   As in any conflict, historians will have to separate truth from
propaganda, but what is clear is how completely the Serbian
government has harnessed its television network as part of daily
political life and, now, in the cause of Serbian defense.
</P>
<P>
   A Serbian television reporter interviews a Serbian general and
begins his questioning with a preface: ``What are your comments on
this somewhat unexpected situation where on one side we have this
huge military power that demonstrates some weaknesses and on the
other side the Yugoslav army who has shown excellent results in
defending their country?''
</P>
<P>
   The general nods and replies that more than 450 planes and 150
missiles have been launched ``against our small country'' in the
first hours of the NATO strike. ``That means they are truly afraid
of us or they are not able to plan and carry out an operation with
forces that are proportional to the enemy forces,'' the general
said. ``Or this means they are planning to carry out a barbaric
genocide against our people.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbian reporters attempt to pre-empt criticism that some of
their film footage may be staged. In another part of the evening
news, the Serbian news anchor reports: ``Tony Blair, British prime
minister, urged British journalists and population not to trust the
TV footage from Yugoslavia showing civilian victims and damage.
This is a new invention of Tony Blair saying even TV footage is not
to be trusted, if it comes from Serbia. Tony Blair obviously wishes
to conceal from his voters the crimes to which he is an
accessory.''
</P>
<P>
   And Serbian journalists appear to be preparing Serbs for a NATO
invasion. ``Our sources report,'' the anchor said in the same
evening news broadcast, ``that in addition to 2,400 NATO soldiers
stationed in Macedonia, 1,800 U.S. soldiers have just arrived. NATO
plans to use these forces to provoke border incidents and stage an
alleged Yugoslav attack on Macedonia, which would be used as a
pretext for sending NATO ground forces into Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO, by contrast, says it has some 10,000 soldiers in Macedonia
_ most of them European _ who are there to enter Kosovo as
peacekeepers if fighting stops.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, television has been on a war
footing since the late 1980s, when the Yugoslav state created by
Marshal Tito, who died in 1980, began to fall apart and the
interethnic rivalries he had suppressed were displayed openly on
television.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed Slobodan Milosevic's rise to power might be traced to
April 1987 when television cameras caught Milosevic, then an
unknown communist bureaucrat, telling a crowd of enraged Serbs in
Kosovo being pushed back by baton-wielding police, ''No one will
dare to beat you again.''
</P>
<P>
   By July 1990, when Serbian authorities took over the
Albanian-language radio and television stations in Pristina,
capital of Kosovo, ethnic Albanians could see a dangerous future.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see it all on television,'' recalled Ismer Jeku, 38,
an ethnic Albanian lawyer in Pristina who moved to New York in 1993
and returned from a visit to Kosovo last month. ``In the early
1990s, Serbian officials started talking about how we must begin to
differentiate. It did not sound harsh, but what they meant was that
Serbs were good and Albanians were evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians who could afford it, and even those who
couldn't, soon started buying _ as an alternative to state-run
television _ expensive satellite dishes costing $500 or more,
equivalent to three months' salary for a working-class Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   There are thousands of satellite dishes now in Kosovo, tuned to
television from Albania proper, but also to American, French,
German and Italian television channels, said an ethnic Albanian who
lives in New York and would give only his first name, Hysen, for
fear of reprisals against his parents and brother in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could say that we could see much satellite TV now,''
he said. But electrical brownouts are common in Pristina, he said,
so there may not be enough electricity to run the additional
equipment, and only state-run Serbian television is available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching Serbian TV, the Serbs are poisoned with chauvinism,''
Hysen said. ``It is a big, big poison.''
</P>
<P>
   Mentor Sejdiu, 32, a former ethnic Albanian doctor in Kosovo and
now an elevator service man in New York, said the Internet filled
some gaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We follow Serbian television to see what the latest lies are
and we turn to the Internet to find the truth,'' he said.

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Defiant as ever and proud of his nation's
resistance to NATO's air attacks, Slobodan Milosevic staged an
eerie celebration Sunday: a rock concert in the center of Belgrade
to show solidarity with the soldiers facing down the allied
assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the thousands of Serbs who attended were unaware that
Sunday was also the 10th anniversary of the day when Milosevic
stripped broad autonomy from Kosovo, just after his security forces
had killed some 30 ethnic Albanian protesters in Pristina, Kosovo's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Serbian security forces continued sweeping
through Kosovo, driving tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians into
panicked flight and provoking what NATO spokesman Jamie Shea called
``the worst humanitarian crisis in Europe since World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, given strict censorship rules and the patriotic
fever of wartime, few Serbs seemed to know much about the events in
Kosovo or Western reaction to them. They poured their scorn on the
Americans, rejoicing in what Serbian television persistently called
the shooting down of an F-117A stealth jet, and rallied around
their nation _ and, by extension, its leader, Milosevic _ in a way
not seen here in years.
</P>
<P>
   The rock concert organized to celebrate the holiday known as
``the day of Serbia's statehood'' bore an ironic resemblance to
similar concerts held by anti-Milosevic demonstrators during the
mass pro-democracy demonstrations of 1996-97 in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The same bands played Sunday to some of the same people, by
their own account symbolizing the unifying effect that airstrikes
have had on the general population. ``Forget who is supporting
whom, this is no time for divisions,'' said one of the lead singers
at the rally, Dejan Cukic.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the thousands at the afternoon rally _ named ``Songs
Keep Us Alive and United'' _ wore small placards on their chests
displaying a black target. One placard referred to the downing of
the stealth aircraft, and read: ``F117 A. Sorry, we didn't know
that you are invisible.'' Another redefined NATO as ``New American
Terrorist Organization,'' while others compared President Clinton
to Hitler, whose air force bombed Belgrade in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   During much of the rally, Belgrade was under an air raid alert.
The first bombs fell Sunday at about 4 a.m., and others followed at
8 a.m., with their detonations preceeding air raid sirens. Air raid
warnings continued to howl after dark. By nightfall, however, in
contrast to Friday and Saturday night, when the city was plunged
into darkness, most of Belgrade's street lights stayed on.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic held a meeting of his Cabinet and military leaders and
issued a statement praising the army and the citizenry. The two
were linked ``by strong unity, a high patriotic conscience and
determination to endure in the just struggle against the criminal
aggressors,'' the statement said. ``Our citizens are demonstrating
high personal responsibility and a high degree of mutual
solidarity.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no reference to increasingly blunt Western charges
that Milosevic's armed forces and police are engaged in widespread
atrocities in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Western reporters with no access to Kosovo were largely reduced
to interviewing the ethnic Albanian refugees pouring across its
borders, a situation reminiscent of Cambodia in the mid-1970s, when
the victorious Khmer Rouge emptied the cities and reporters had to
piece together the scale of atrocities from the refugees who
straggled into Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   On Serbian state television's evening news, the Serbian minister
for refugees, Bratislava Morina, whose late husband was a Kosovo
Albanian Communist, suggested that ethnic Albanians were fleeing
NATO bombs, not the Serb military. ``If NATO wants these people to
return to their homes, it should stop this aggression
immediately,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the official Tanjug news agency did announce that NATO
planes attacked before and after sunrise, targeting the air force
base in the Belgrade suburb of Batajnica for the fourth consecutive
day. Two explosions cracked windows at Belgrade's main civilian
airport, Surcin, 15 miles from the city center. Other missiles fell
near Cacak, site of a huge military factory in central Serbia,
Tanjug said. In Kosovo, four bombs hit an army barracks outside
Prizren, the agency said. There was no report of any casualties. To
date, the Yugoslav media has talked of dozens killed in the air
raids.
</P>
<P>
   At the rally, words of general patriotism came from noted
performers like Cukic and Momcilo Bagajic, known as Bajaga, who
said: ``We should defend ourselves.'' Bagajic is known not to be a
rabid nationalist, and he has played in other parts of the former
Yugoslavia, like Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote a hugely popular and moving song about the Yugoslav
civil wars, largely initiated by Milosevic, that says: ``My friends
are pearls scattered all over the world.'' Ironically, the
government is now playing the song often on state television as a
backdrop to patriotic pictures of the Yugoslav armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   One member of the Children of Bad Musicians, a popular group,
told the crowd: ``I used to play sax, but since that sex maniac
plays it, I don't touch it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Olga, a 43-year-old economist wearing a fur vest and Italian
shoes, said she never went to the air-raid shelters because she
could not bring her English setter, Loli. She is no fan of
Milosevic, she said, but war is no time for divisions. ``I was in
all the demonstrations for democracy,'' she said, ``but now I have
to be in favor of defending my homeland.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Zoran Djindjic, the leader of the Democratic
Party and an organizer of the pro-democracy demonstrations, noted
the irony. ``The bombs have marginalized any dissenters here, and
there's little we democrats can do to affect the situation,'' he
said. ``The same is also true of those democrats and moderates
among the ethnic Albanians,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has spent more on one day's bombs than it ever spent
helping the democracy movement in Yugoslavia, Djindjic said
bitterly. ``Milosevic could be far more easily eliminated through
the development of democracy here than through air strikes,'' he
said. ``Every crisis strengthens him. The only players that matter
now are Milosevic, the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The consequences of the air strikes are ``this radicalized and
pauperized Serbia and a destabilized Montenegro,'' whose
independence under President Milo Djukanovic Washington wanted to
encourage, Djindjic said. Yugoslavia consists of Serbia and
Montenegro, and Djukanovic is a former protege of Milosevic who in
the past year has turned against the Yugoslav president. ``Now
Djukanovic is compromised by the bombs, and there is more
anti-American feeling in the entire region,'' Djindjic said.
</P>
<P>
   There are Yugoslav military and police depots and headquarters
in Montenegro, and NATO has bombed them freely, despite a statement
by Djukanovic that Montenegro would stay neutral in any fight
between NATO and Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic and Djukanovic are close, and Djukanovic told him the
day the bombing began that no one in the American government ever
telephoned to explain the situation or to warn him, Djindjic said.
``Ordinary people in Montenegro will now say that Djukanovic based
his entire policy on America, but we're getting bombed just as
badly as Milosevic,'' Djindjic said. ``This will make it much more
difficult for Montenegro to secede.''
</P>
<P>
   The evening news gave an interesting hint of a Russian
initiative to solve this crisis, announcing that Russian President
Boris Yeltsin and Milosevic had exchanged letters. But the Yugoslav
ambassador to Moscow, Milosevic's brother, Borislav, said he could
not confirm that the two presidents would meet, and there was no
indication that a Russian delegation which arrived Sunday and
includes former Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar would get anywhere with
its own peace initiative. France said it was pressing Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov to seek a diplomatic solution. Russia is
a traditional backer of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday the Yugoslav government for the first time organized a
junket for some 70 foreign journalists here _ dominated by non-NATO
countries like Japan _ to the site where the F-117A crashed, in
Budjanovci, 30 miles northwest of Belgrade. Reporters, in two
buses, were only allowed to see the remains of a wing while local
villagers danced with evident joy at this small triumph of their
hugely outgunned military.
</P>
<P>
   A young boy wearing a knitted cap bearing the logo of the
Chicago Bulls stood on the U.S. Air Force star painted on the wing,
while the assembled cameramen scrambled for angles. The boy had a
toy pistol in one hand while he tried to make the Serb victory sign
with the other.
</P>
<P>
   The evening news said that, in addition to the wartime
censorship that now applies to media, new wartime banking rules had
been established to fund the military, and that profiteering would
be punished severely. On Sunday the newspaper Glas Javnosti printed
a story about the arrest of the first ``war profiteers'' in the
city of Nis: a man and his son who owned a gas station and had been
hoarding 3,171 liters of gasoline, 5,300 liters of diesel fuel and
1,000 liters of oil. Gasoline is nearly unavailable now except on
the black market, where the price has reached almost 10 German
marks a liter, many times its price a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   On the back page of the newspaper, however, there was a story
about the opening of the yearly automobile show at the Belgrade
Fair, featuring a photograph of the new Volkswagen Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Sunday, Dragoslav Rancic, a senior contributing editor
of the weekly magazine Nin, and his editor, Stevan Niksic, were
released from police custody. They were arrested early Saturday for
offending censorship regulations with an article about Milosevic's
negotiating style. Friends said they had not been beaten by the
police.
</P>
<P>
   No Belgrade newspaper published a word about their arrest, a
sharp contrast to the solidarity local journalists displayed when
Veran Matic, the chief editor of the banned radio station B-92, was
detained for eight hours last Wednesday. But Wednesday night, the
first NATO bombs fell on Belgrade, and, as one local journalist
said bitterly, ``media solidarity is evidently another casualty.''

   TIRANA, Albania _ Their Kosovo villages in flames behind them,
tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians are being hounded by Serb
forces into Albania by Serbian forces, threatening to overwhelm the
scant resources of this desperately poor country and the hasty
efforts of Western aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in long lines of battered cars, on tractors and on
foot, the refugees told harrowing tales of being wrenched out of
their homes by Serbian police and paramilitary units, sometimes
robbed and even stripped of their license plates before they
crossed the mountainous border.
</P>
<P>
   The head of a European observer mission said that at least
15,000 people had crossed into Albania by Sunday evening, and
arriving refugees spoke of a column stretching back more than 10
miles, with an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Even as NATO stepped up its air raids against Yugoslavia, the
forced exodus here, and similar reports of columns of refugees
headed into other areas bordering the embattled, rebellious
province of Kosovo appear to show a deliberate effort by the Serbs
to apply the tactics of ``ethnic cleansing'' they had used in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a scorched-earth policy,'' said a senior Western official
here. ``We're seeing the same thing as in Bosnia, a similar sort of
scenario. The refugees are on the road again.''
</P>
<P>
   A border crossing closed by the Serbs for the past 11 months on
a main highway through the mountains between Prizren in Kosovo and
Kukes in Albania was suddenly opened about 3 p.m. Saturday with
about 2,500 people crossing before it was shut down at 10 p.m.,
Western relief officials said. It reopened at 3 a.m. Sunday,
setting off a day of chaos with streams of refugees pouring into
Kukes, a town of some 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 5 o'clock, we couldn't count the refugees,'' said Andrea
Angeli of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
``It's really dramatic up there. They are coming in at a thousand
an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the arrivals was a van that pulled into Kukes about 11:30
a.m. and disgorged about 75 people, including small children and
babies, who had been packed inside for the six-hour drive from the
village of Korish, a photographer there said. The refugees told
harrowing stories of the places they had left.
</P>
<P>
   Isuf Morina, gray-haired and neatly dressed, described how
Serbian forces had selected about 200 men from his village of
Krushe and forced them to give the three-fingered Serbian salute
before mowing them down with automatic weapons. Nuhi Mazreku, a
46-year-old schoolteacher from Manisheva, said Serbs in his village
had methodically broken all the baby carriages they could find.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a pleasant story,'' said Eugene O'Sullivan, head of
the European security organization's observer mission in Kukes. ``A
lot of them got a knock on the door in the morning and were told to
leave. It depended on who was doing the ethnic cleansing. Some were
given an hour or so to get their things together. Others were not
so lucky. They were just told to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a final vetting at the border, where they were
taking necklaces and rings from the ladies, and stereos and the
better cars,'' he continued. ``There is a consistency going through
these stories that, while we can't independently confirm them, it
seems impossible to be made up.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Sullivan said the final step in the exodus of the ethnic
Albanians had been the confiscation by Serbs of their passports,
identity papers and even license plates, ``so these people no
longer exist as far as they are concerned.'' Accounts from refugees
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is particularly evil,'' O'Sullivan, who has
served with international agencies in Africa and Bosnia, said by
mobile phone late Sunday. ``It's very difficult to see how this can
be stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   European observers near the border could see villages in flames,
including Orahovac, a major settlement in the agricultural region
northwest of Prizren, the area that appeared to be home to most of
the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The chief representative of the rebel Kosovars here _ Ilaz
Ramajli, with an office in the diplomatic quarter of this
ramshackle capital _ said he had reports of a column of refugees
some five miles long on the way to Montenegro from Pec. Montenegro
is the last state still allied with Serbia in what is left of the
former Yugoslavia, but has been showing increasing signs of
independence from Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of other refugees have streamed into Macedonia _ also
once part of Yugoslavia _ causing increased tension there,
including violent demonstrations against the American embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the refugees were women, children and old people.
European officials said they did not know whether the men of
fighting age might have slipped into the forest, joined rebel bands
or, perhaps, met a fate that one described as ``somewhat worse than
that.''

<P>
   Once the last Stalinist bastion of the Eastern bloc under the
dictator Enver Hoxha, Albania of late has slid into anarchy and is
ill-equipped to help its fleeing ethnic brethren. What little order
there was dissolved a few years back in widespread anti-government
rioting over a failed nationwide investment scheme that saw most of
the army's weapons looted, up to and including tanks. Roads have
crumbled, gangsters are the major force in what there is of the
economy and, Western officials here say, there is virtually no
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   The government held an emergency meeting Sunday of a special
committee headed by Deputy Prime Minister Ilir Meta to attempt to
cope with the refugee crisis. Some 100 buses, government officials
said, would be sent up the rough roads to Kukes to bring refugees
back to the capital in hopes local families would take them in. But
a main outcome of the meeting was a call for help from foreign aid
donors.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian President Rexhep Mejdani called Sunday for NATO to send
ground troops into Kosovo as the only way to stop what he called
``monstrous crimes ... ethnic cleansing and depopulation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramajli, the local representative of the ``Republic of Kosovo''
_ the independent state ethnic Albanians have proclaimed in their
embattled province _ made a similar appeal in a meeting this
evening with a group of American correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how difficult it is to take this decision, especially
for President Bill Clinton, but I think this is the right time for
the U.S. to intervene on the ground,'' Ramajli said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has insisted that no ground troops will be sent to
Kosovo and that air power alone will be used to accomplish NATO's
goals _ which, at this point, appear somewhat murky.
</P>
<P>
   As darkness fell, some 8,000 people gathered in Skanderberg
Square _ dominated by a fierce statue of the 15th-century warrior
king who led a failed revolt against the Ottomans _ for a rally in
support of NATO and the Kosovars. It was a rare event in which the
American flag was waved rather than burned.
</P>
<P>
   At the offices of the U.N. High Commission for Refugees, the
main agency running relief efforts, Jim Worrall, the field
coordinator, struggled to pull together tents, mattresses, beds and
the trucks to deliver them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The infrastructure here is nonexistent. A large influx is
going to create problems,'' he said. ``We'll never get enough stuff
up there. It's a day up, a day to unload, a day back. I dispatched
trucks this morning. I don't know when I'll see them again.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficulties were compounded, he added, because just at the
time the aid agencies were meeting to evaluate this year's needs,
American envoy Richard Holbrooke appeared to have made a peace
agreement with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was hoping for a political settlement,'' he said,
referring to talks at Rambouillet, the French chateau. ``Holbrooke
and Milosevic signed and had a beer. Rambouillet was supposed to be
like Dayton. Then it was like will they or won't they?''

   WASHINGTON _ Shortly after 8:45 p.m. Saturday in the Balkans, a
secretive search-and-rescue team based with U.S. forces in Bosnia
received an urgent phone call: An F-117 stealth fighter, the
premier attack plane in America's arsenal, was down in Yugoslavia.
The fate of the Air Force pilot was unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, a night-time recovery mission was under way
tapping the talents of an elite special operations team that stands
poised to pluck downed and injured pilots from stormy seas or from
behind enemy lines.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 5,000 miles away in Washington, the national security
adviser, Sandy Berger, broke the news to President Clinton at the
White House. ``Keep me informed,'' Clinton responded grimly,
according to a White House aide.
</P>
<P>
   For the next seven hours, Berger, Defense Secretary William
Cohen and Gen. Henry Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, waited anxiously and fielded dozens of phone calls from Gen.
Wesley Clark, NATO's military commander in Brussels, updating them
on the situation.
</P>
<P>
   There were emotional highs and lows. At one point, Pentagon
aides cheered with joy when it was reported the pilot had been
saved, only to learn it was a false report. At about 7:30 p.m.
Eastern time, or 1:30 a.m. in Yugoslavia, tension rose as CNN
reported that Belgrade had launched a massive manhunt for the
downed pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at 9:35 p.m. Eastern time, three specially equipped Air
Force MH-60G Pave Hawk and MH-53J Pave Low helicopters, skimming
over treetops at more than 150 mph, swooped in to snatch the pilot
from his hiding place. He had suffered bruises and a battered
kneecap in the ejection but was otherwise well.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, a field grade officer, parachuted to earth more than
10 miles west of where his $43 million radar-evading plane had
crashed, 35 miles northwest of Belgrade. The Pentagon has not said
what caused the plane to go down.
</P>
<P>
   Although the area around the rescue site was teeming with
heavily armed Yugoslav troops, the rescue mission took no enemy
fire. Seventeen minutes later, with the might of the allied air
operation covering its flight home, the rescue team crossed back
into Bosnian airspace.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Washington, Berger alerted Clinton, who expressed
relief. At the Pentagon, spokesman Kenneth Bacon confirmed the
pilot's safe return, but he declined to disclose any details,
cautioning that NATO may need to rescue other pilots and did not
want to give away its extraction trade secrets to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, whom Shelton described Sunday as a ``very
experienced'' aviator, belongs to the 8th Fighter Squadron at
Holloman Air Force Base, N.M. Air Force officials said the pilot,
who declined all interviews Sunday and asked his superiors to
withhold his name, wants to return to duty as soon as possible. He
was flown Sunday to a NATO air base in Aviano, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The outlines of the most perilous pilot rescue since Capt. Scott
F. O'Grady was snared by marines six days after a Serbian missile
felled his F-16 fighter jet over Bosnia in June 1995, emerged
Sunday in interviews with more than a dozen military officials here
and in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on rescue combat air patrols in Vietnam where we
stayed for a long time,'' Gen. Michael Ryan, the Air Force chief of
staff, said in an interview. ``The process is very calculated. You
have to take it step by step. I can tell you this last operation
was done very well.''

COMMENTARY: CUTTING MY LOSSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ You have to know when to hold 'em and when to fold
'em. On the issue of casino gambling _ its promotion of a false
something-for-nothing philosophy, its corruption of both parties'
politics with millions in Big Gambling cash _ I am folding my hand.
</P>
<P>
   That's because we moralizing saps have been rolled over by the
chiseling champions of chance. Ten years ago, gambling was legal in
two states; today only three prohibit it. The business has
mushroomed fivefold in that time to to well over $50 billion a
year. Candidates for governor who try to restrict gambling lose to
the gamblers' candidates.
</P>
<P>
   An extensive national study conducted at the University of
Chicago for the National Gambling Impact Study Commission found
that 2.5 million Americans are ``pathological'' gamblers. Ho hum:
That's only 1 percent of the population (not including mere
``problem gamblers''). Who cares if these compulsives go down the
drain, and take their families with them? A piddling $5 billion a
year goes to legal fees for divorce, court and jail costs for
arrests, lost wages and bankruptcy; though many of these costs are
borne by the general taxpayer, nobody's suing.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``slots for tots'' crusade, a new generation of gamblers
is being brainwashed to join today's gambling geezers, betting
lunch money on video games in schoolyards and unrestricted Internet
crapshooting. Moral outrage? That's for stiffs, bluenoses, uptight
ministers and far-right fogies. To the laid-back majority,
one-armed banditry has become a recreational experience for young
and old.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the Supreme Court is expected to strike down the
prohibition against gambling advertising on television and radio.
That means Las Vegas will be able to compete with lotteries to
reach the lowest roller. Face it: Casinoland gambling is on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   But on public lotteries _ state-sponsored plundering of the poor
_ we diehard work-ethicists have a last hand to play and a few
chips left. Here's a pitch for the libertarians: Let consenting
adults gamble privately to their heart's content, but  &UR; get
government out of the gambling business.  &LR;  We all know the phony
rationale for state-sponsored lotteries. If the city or state
didn't take over the numbers racket, organized crime would profit
from the Playing Poor. Baloney. Numbers runners of the past could
never rope in a huge audience by mass advertising on billboards and
television. The lottery lobby _ elected con artists too timorous to
call a tax a tax _ now spends nearly a half-billion dollars a year
urging citizens to gamble. These officials pervert public policy,
which should at least do no harm.
</P>
<P>
   We are also told that lottery money is painless taxation, with a
portion of profits pledged to education. More baloney. Funds are
fungible: when state lottery money is spent on education,
legislatures cut back other money for schools.
</P>
<P>
   In ridiculing those arguments a decade ago, I extended the
notion of a sin tax to government-run prostitution. Why let the
profits from sex-for-sale go to predatory pimps when Washington
could collect the procuring fee, with proceeds going to health care
for the post-elderly? Why not ``Good Courtesanship'' awards to
licensed, professional prostitutes who cater to the inexperienced,
shy or unhandsome? (Unfortunately, that satire backfired; too many
readers thought federal brothels a neat idea.)
</P>
<P>
   But good ends do not justify bad means; the good end of
education through the bad means of gambling could lead to the end
of other support of education.
</P>
<P>
   Having lost the pot on private gambling, how can we win the pot
on state-advocated gambling? Answer: For this political argument on
public policy, we need the liberals. Conservatives cannot
effectively make the argument that the lottery is a regressive tax,
a rip-off of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Does Jesse Jackson know that blacks spend four times more than
whites per capita on lotteries, thereby using the dollars of poor
blacks to subsidize wealthier whites? Does Ted Kennedy, from the
gambling-crazed state of Massachusetts, know that 5 percent of
lottery players account for 51 percent of total lottery sales in
the nation, and that these frequent losers are not the rich? Is no
progressive policy maker in the Clinton Interior Department
troubled by the massive payoffs on both sides of the Indian casino
grab?
</P>
<P>
   Lefties: Now that the poor are being victimized, what's become
of you?

VENUS WILLIAMS TAKES THE SIBLING SHOWDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. _ Their father likened it to a bullfight,
this Lipton Championships finale between his teen-age prodigies
Venus and Serena Williams, the first sisters to lock horns in a
final since Maud Watson ambushed her older sister Lilian and
hoisted the trophy at Wimbledon in 1884.
</P>
<P>
   A century later, and a world away from the genteel brand of lawn
tennis demonstrated by the Watsons in their billowing white skirts,
the Williams sisters strode onto the stadium hard court Sunday
wearing skin-tight designer outfits and matching glares.
</P>
<P>
   Both had ample reason to feel bullish about the circumstances
that complicated their first final against each other. This was one
of those thorny situations where sibling empathy, they agreed, had
to take a back seat to sibling ambition.
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams, 18, had her 1998 Lipton title to defend and a
2-0 record against her little sister to uphold, and Serena, 17, had
her tour-leading 16-match undefeated streak on the line, along with
an opportunity to break into the Top 10 if she broke through the
big-sister barrier and captured this title.
</P>
<P>
   Their 1-hour-58-minute slugfest was the debut of what promises
to be a lengthy sister-to-sister rivalry whenever there's a trophy
at stake, and in the end it was Venus who kept her errors to a
minimum and her composure to a maximum and prevailed, 6-1, 4-6,
6-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serena always comes back and defeats people, and I didn't want
to become another victim,'' Venus Williams said. ``But in the end,
we go home, we live life. You have to remind yourself that it's a
game, and there's only one winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a second-set spell in which she let her 16th-seeded
sibling strut her stuff from the baseline, the sixth-seeded Venus
Williams, helped by the reach from her spidery 6-foot-2-inch frame
and her 117-mile-an-hour serves, gained and maintained the upper
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every time Venus plays Serena, she tries to murder
Serena; I just waved the red cape and just let them go at it,''
said Richard Williams, who determined, when the two youngest of his
five daughters were mere kindergartners, that tennis was the
likeliest vehicle to transport them from their ghetto beginnings in
Compton, Calif., to the celebrity status and six-figure paydays
they are enjoying Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The winner, 2-for-2 in title defenses in 1999, after her repeat
victories here and at Oklahoma City, collected $265,000; the
runner-up, who reached three consecutive finals and collected the
first two titles of her career during this streak, earned $132,500.
</P>
<P>
   Although Richard Williams insists that he allows no trophies
across the threshold of the family's compound in Palm Beach
Gardens, Fla., he said he would have to make an exception for the
two crystal bowls that signified his daughters' history-making
encounter Sunday afternoon on the stadium court he calls ``Venus'
house.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This trophy will not go in the garage,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Both sisters denied that the confrontation, or future
confrontations, had the power to put a damper on their familial
bond. Adversaries at crunch time, they remain best friends the rest
of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that family comes first, not a game that's going to
last 10 years at the most,'' Serena Williams said. ``Why would I
want that to come between someone who has always been around,
always been a very special friend for me? I couldn't imagine that,
and I don't think she could either.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, the loser made it clear that she has no sibling
inferiority complex regarding her sister. ``I'm definitely looking
forward to another final with Venus,'' Serena said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always dreamed of seeing her on the other side of the net,
and now that my game is taken to a different level, it's going to
happen more,'' added Serena, whose back-to-back titles came at
events where Venus steered clear of the same singles draw.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Feb. 28, the day Serena won her first career title, in Paris,
Venus was busy defending her first career title, in Oklahoma. That
day marked another historic coup for the Williams sisters, who
became the first sisters to claim separate titles on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   In a different competitive format, Venus Williams, the more
aloof and regal of the sisters, might win the pageant while her
younger, chattier sister would be a shoo-in for Miss Congeniality.
But on the tennis court, they aren't just aiming to be No. 1 and
No. 2 in the world: they envision themselves as co-No. 1's.
</P>
<P>
   Steffi Graf, whose last three losses have been wrought by one or
another Williams sister, said the duo are destined for great
things. ``Their athleticism is incredible, they're taking risks,
they don't really have a certain weakness, and they're tall and
big,'' Graf said.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's final, neither Williams sister played the furious
level of tennis that took them to this point.
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams, bothered by a tired right knee, which has
absorbed the wear and tear of reaching three tournament finals
within a five-week span, made 66 unforced errors and dropped her
serve seven times.
</P>
<P>
   After working her way back into the third set, in which Venus
had taken a 3-1 lead, and knotting things up at 4-4 by breaking her
sister with a ruthless backhand pass, Serena, who moves to 11th in
the ranking, served up nothing but errors in the ninth game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a lot of errors, eight or nine, went for too much too
soon,'' she said. ``That was really out of control there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just wasn't the same Serena like the rest of my 16
matches,'' she said, referring to her winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Given the chance to serve for the match, Venus Williams made no
mistakes. She held at love, and calmly accepted victory when her
little sister, subordinated once again, rushed a forehand that
clipped the net and caromed wide. The sisters exchanged a high-five
at the net, and as they walked toward the umpire's chair, Venus
draped a comradely arm around her sister and gently patted her
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good, I was making my shots, I didn't feel any
pressure,'' said Venus, who also got the better of her sister in
the mixed doubles final last year at the French Open. ``Serena is a
great player, she takes down players left and right, so to survive
such an onslaught is just great.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner will continue to be the loser's biggest fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I teach her everything I can,'' Venus Williams said, ``do
everything I can to make Serena the best player she can be, and
that I can be. I believe in my game.''

BP AMOCO AND ARCO ARE REPORTED TO BE HOLDING TALKS ON A MERGER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS and LAURA M. HOLSON  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BP Amoco PLC, the giant oil company, has been in serious
discussions to buy the Atlantic Richfield Co., the oil and gas
exploration and refining concern, executives close to the talks
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations, which have been going on for months, have not
yet produced a deal and could still collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Sir John Browne, the chief executive of BP Amoco,
met last week with Michael R. Bowlin, the chairman and chief
executive of ARCO, and there have been discussions about price,
according to the people close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   If an agreement is reached, an announcement could come as early
as this week.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed deal for ARCO, which is based in Los Angeles and is
the nation's eighth-largest oil company, could be complicated,
however, if another bidder emerges.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Sieminski, an oil analyst with BT Alex. Brown, said that BP
Amoco would have to offer about $25 billion, or a 20 percent
premium over its closing price of $65.375 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Browne has been a pacesetter in his industry for mergers, which
have been spurred by a year of low crude oil prices that dampened
the earnings of most large oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, he jolted the industry by announcing an agreement
to buy the Amoco Corporation, which was based in Chicago, in a deal
valued at about $48 billion at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Browne wasted little time, vowing to save $2 billion a year in
costs and deftly steering the complex transaction around many
regulatory hurdles to completion in late December.
</P>
<P>
   ``He closed it quickly,'' Sieminski said. ``He has taken
charge.''
</P>
<P>
   His bold move led Lee R. Raymond, the chairman of Exxon, to
offer to buy the Mobil Corp. for $80 billion in December, a deal
that would form the world's largest corporation.
</P>
<P>
   If Browne succeeds in acquiring ARCO, which has a market value
of about $21 billion, it will catapult BP Amoco into a tie with
Royal Dutch/Shell Group for second place among the giant
international oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   With the emergence of such giants, who have also formed
alliances with other companies to help cut costs in refining in the
United States and Europe, smaller oil companies like ARCO have
scrambled to find strategies to survive.
</P>
<P>
   With crude oil prices plunging from about $18 a barrel at this
time last year to as low as $12, ARCO saw its earnings drop to
$1.79 a share last year from $5.28 a share in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ARCO, which gets a larger share of its profits from oil sales
than its largest U.S. rivals, had a fourth-quarter loss of $794
million, or $2.47 a share, its first unprofitable quarter in six
years. The company took charges to write down assets and inventory
because of low oil prices and also for costs associated with
cutting 1,200 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a recent recovery in crude oil prices because of cuts
in production announced by major oil-exporting nations, analysts
were wondering whether ARCO could earn enough this year to pay its
yearly dividend of $2.85 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Bowlin has attempted to strengthen ARCO, selling its chemical
business last year for $5.6 billion. He also acquired an
independent oil company, Union Texas Holdings Inc. of Houston, for
$2.47 billion last May to bolster ARCO's reserves and gain entry
into the Caspian Sea region, where most large oil companies are
vying for rights to develop fields with vast reserves.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he has let analysts know that he would welcome
a an offer for the company if the price was right for shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Neither company's representatives returned calls Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As with Amoco, Browne is expected to face few antitrust
problems, which mostly concern the refining and marketing of
gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   ARCO has a significant refining and marketing operations on the
West Coast, an area where BP Amoco has little presence.
</P>
<P>
   ARCO and British Petroleum were the main companies that
developed the vast reserves in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, where
production, while still substantial, has been falling.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Federal Trade Commission, which would review the
transaction, has focused on the competitive effects of refining
rather than crude oil production, where entry is more open and
there are many areas of opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco could save money by combining Alaskan operations. ARCO,
by developing new fields, has stemmed the decline of its production
in Alaska but has found it hard to come up with the huge amounts of
capital needed to make inroads in areas such as the Caspian Sea. BP
Amoco produced 450,000 barrels of oil a day from Alaska last year,
while Arco produced 317,000 barrels a day, company figures show.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Browne has not let up on cutting costs. He announced
on Feb. 17 that BP Amoco would cut 10,000 jobs and speed up its
goal of getting $2 billion in annual savings in one year rather
than two.
</P>
<P>
   He added that BP Amoco would take $1.5 billion in charges this
year, mainly to cover the costs of severance for the workers who
lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   As most oil executives do, he wants to make his company
profitable even if the current run-up in crude oil prices fizzles
and the harsh conditions of the last year continue.

SPORTS COLUMN: `GO WILLIAMS' YELLED, AND BOTH OF THEM DID
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. _ Just when tennis fans thought they had seen
everything, there were two sisters slugging away in the final of a
major tournament, while their father sat in the stands scribbling
words with a grease pencil on a hand-held message board, for all
the world to see.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Williams, who claims he once consulted a psychiatrist,
or maybe it was two psychiatrists, to determine the proper way to
handle two sisters in the same profession, seemed oblivious to his
intrusion into the world of his daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams and Serena Williams have long since learned to
block things out _ most everybody and everything around them.
Venus, as remote as that distant planet, said about her father's
message board: ``I couldn't see the sign. My eyes aren't that
good.'' And Serena insisted she did not give much thought to the
player on the other side of the net.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time two sisters had played each other in a
major final in 115 years, which, in its own quirky way, put this
Lipton Championships final in the same category as the Baltimore
Orioles visiting Havana, only 90 miles away, straight across the
sparkling water.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Venus Williams defeated Serena Williams, 6-1,
4-6, 6-4, and Richard Williams set a record by writing seven _
count' em, seven _ messages that he strenuously displayed for the
television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to the Williams Show,'' was his first message.
</P>
<P>
   He said the hand-held board had to do with helping children with
AIDS, or something to that effect, but then again, this is the same
man who said the other day that he was thinking of buying
Rockefeller Center.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, we should not scoff at Richard Williams, who a few
years ago professed to have a plan to make his daughters champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you so!'' his second sign said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters are both competitive, and they can hit the fuzz
right off the yellow balls, and they also seem to love each other
very much. The father used to have it both ways by saying Venus
came first but that Serena would be better. Some think he has some
master plan. Some think he simply likes to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the other day that the psychiatrists had told him
``that it wouldn't be good to enter Venus in this tournament and
Serena in this tournament because we wanted two girls to grow up
with a bunch of love for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``And that love needed to be cultivated and developed,
and it needed time to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Every family has assigned roles, which members cannot easily
relinquish. In the Williams family, Venus is the dreamy one and
Serena is the mean one. They were supposed to practice against each
other on Saturday at the family compound north of here, but they
claimed they were giggling so much that they got nothing
accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's match, Venus blasted Serena in the first set, after
which Williams showed his third message: ``Go Serena Go!!!''
</P>
<P>
   Serena started to pound back, breaking Venus twice, and the
father held up his fourth sign: ``It Couldn't Have Happened to a
Better Family.'' With the younger daughter back in the match, the
father went for a walk for nine games, smoking a cigarette, trying
to beat down a vendor for a $3 pretzel at half price.
</P>
<P>
   Serena won the second set, and the sisters were on serve, when
Williams came back, his writer's block now over. His fifth sign
said, ``Hello to My Mother-in-Law, Ora Lee Price.''
</P>
<P>
   His sixth sign said, ``Hello to My Friends in Compton,'' a
reference to the old neighborhood back in Los Angeles, which he
rarely discusses these days, but Sunday he did refer to the drugs
and the gangs and an alleged $15 million community center he is
allegedly going to build. (Can't use allegedly too often in this
case.)
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, Williams had been totally tasteful and low-key, but
now he got a trifle tacky, and held up a sign that said, ``The
Williams Family Loves Fox TV.'' That was just before Serena
faltered in the last two games, and Venus closed her out.
</P>
<P>
   The two sisters did not show much emotion on the court, and
Venus did not do her normal victory dance, and the sisters did not
display much emotion afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't necessarily say that our relationship is going to be
affected by tennis,'' Serena said later. ``We have a strong
background. We're Jehovah's Witnesses; we really believe that
family comes first, not a game that's going to last 10 years at the
most.''
</P>
<P>
   The father and his daughters scoffed at the suggestion that
there was something scripted about the match. Venus said people
don't understand exactly how competitive Serena is, and Serena
showed just the slightest sizzle about losing to the same opponent
three straight times.
</P>
<P>
   And when they are both on the court, they cannot see their
father's message board.

IT TAKES EXTRA INNINGS FOR ORIOLES TO TOP CUBANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ The team that compiled a losing record last year
despite having the highest payroll in baseball history nearly
topped itself Sunday. Embarrassing themselves but avoiding
humiliation, the Baltimore Orioles outlasted the Cuban national
team, 3-2, in 11 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles rallied for the winning run after the Cubans played
the gracious host and removed Jose Contreras, who allowed two hits
and struck out 10 batters in eight innings of relief.
</P>
<P>
   No judgment can be made about the relative ability of the Cuban
team on one game; over a series of games, the strength and depth of
the Orioles would surely prevail.
</P>
<P>
   But this was an interesting development for the Cubans, who can
take some sort of bragging rights away from the game, the first for
a major league team in Cuba in 40 years, as they prepare for a
return match in Baltimore on May 3 and future games with other
major league teams.
</P>
<P>
   The most interested spectator in the crowd of about 50,000 at
Estadio Latinoamericano might have been Fidel Castro, who arrived
about half an hour before the game, visited both dugouts briefly,
then went to his seat and remained there for all 11 innings. He
left the stadium without offering his views of the game publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Bud Selig, the commissioner of baseball, sat to Castro's left
and Peter Angelos, the Orioles' owner and the prime mover behind
this game, sat to his right.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was delighted when the game was tied,'' Angelos said,
``because they were behind for over half the game. It didn't appear
that they were going to catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   But after Harold Baines lashed a two-out single up the middle in
the 11th, driving home Will Clark with the tie-breaking run, and
Jesse Garcia turned a diving stop of a grounder between first and
second into the game's final out with a runner at first, Castro's
mood changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was a little disappointed,'' Angelos said,
``because it appeared there in the eighth and ninth inning that
they were going to prevail. But we got the breaks and we won.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles won in spite of the long and sparkling relief effort
of Contreras, normally a starting pitcher, and the poor batting
performance of Albert Belle, the Orioles' often slugging right
fielder.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans loved Belle before the game when he hit one batting
practice home run after another, and they loved him even more
during the game when he made one out after another.
</P>
<P>
   Belle batted five times and did not get the ball out of the
infield, striking out twice, grounding out, grounding into a
forceout and grounding into a double play. He ended three innings
with a total of four runners on base. Contreras retired him three
times.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen him in other games before and knew something about
him so I was ready for him,'' Contreras, a 27-year-old
right-hander, said through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban pitcher, in fact, seemed to have done a whole scouting
job on the Orioles himself. He said he had seen some of their
post-season games on television and videotape and was not just
guessing out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a strategy against their best batters,'' he said. ``My
strategy was to pitch against the weak points of each batter.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was nervous, Contreras said: ``I was a little
anxious and nervous because for 40 years no American (professional)
team had played in Cuba. As the game went on, I felt more
confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfonso Urquiola, the Cuban manager, or director, as he is
called here, brought Contreras into the game after Jose Ibar, the
starter, opened the third inning by hitting Brady Anderson with a
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning Ibar threw a pitch that Orioles catcher
Charles Johnson, who played here in the 1991 Pan-American Games,
slugged for a two-run home run, the only runs the Orioles scored
until the decisive 11th inning.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Pedro Perez, the Cuban team's pitching coach,
sat in the dugout with Ibar, going over reports he had compiled on
some of the Baltimore batters from a videotape of a game the
Orioles played against the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave him a short report on what we know, but we don't know
very much,'' Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   Perez said he hoped to have Ibar pitch five or six innings, but
Urquiola had seen enough one batter into the third. Urquiola
explained later that he removed Ibar because he was not very
effective and ``his speed was not good enough, not the one he
usually has.''
</P>
<P>
   The early pitching change turned out to be brilliant. But then
Urquiola had to go and spoil his day by removing Contreras after
the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Contreras, who had missed two and a half months of the Cuban
season with a hand injury and had last pitched 15 days ago, said he
felt good enough to stay in the game. Spoken like a true major
leaguer. But, he added, it was the manager's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a little tired; he had thrown a lot of pitches,''
Urquiola said.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. Surhoff, the Orioles' left fielder, said Contreras was
effective because he mixed speeds on his pitches, was able to throw
his breaking ball over when he was behind in the count and did not
throw anything right down the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bordick singled against Contreras in the fifth inning, then
was thrown out trying to steal as Clark struck out. Anderson rapped
a leadoff double to right field with no one out in the eighth, but
Contreras struck out Bordick, walked Clark intentionally and
induced Belle to ground into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   He walked three other batters. But after he put two batters on
base with walks in the fourth he struck out Jeff Reboulet for the
third out, and he struck out Anderson in the 10th after walking
Reboulet, who then became the third out when he tried to steal
second.
</P>
<P>
   As Contreras induced Johnson to ground out as the leadoff batter
in the 10th, Castro turned to Angelos and said something. Could the
Orioles' owner have been trying to make a deal for the pitcher?
</P>
<P>
   Angelos, when asked, laughed and said: ``That would have marred
the trip. Some people said the purpose of coming here was to spirit
away Cuban baseball players. That was not our purpose.'' He paused,
then added, ``Even if he had been offered, we would have turned it
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Lazo was the pitcher chosen to replace Contreras in the
11th. ``Lazo is very good at ending the game,'' Urquiola said. Not
this time.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba scored individual runs in the seventh inning against Scott
Erickson, the Orioles' starter, and in the eighth against Arthur
Rhodes and Mike Timlin, the Orioles' closer.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Miller, the Baltimore manager, said he never thought about
the possibility of losing the game. But he certainly played to win.
He had his first team in the starting lineup except for Cal Ripken
Jr., whose father died last week, and he made only one change other
than for pitching.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted to one other bit of strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I did today,'' he said, ``was bring in my closer
to face Linares. I know very little about the club except that he's
a great ballplayer and if we get him out, we have a good chance of
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Omar Linares came to bat in the eighth with two out and Jose
Estrada at third base after a leadoff double. Rhodes had just
retired Yobal Duenas, who led the Cuban League with a .418 batting
average this season, for the second out.
</P>
<P>
   Linares, a five-time Cuban batting champion and one of the
greatest Cuban players ever, foiled Miller's plan by stroking a
single to left field, tying the score.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10th, however, Linares batted with runners at first and
second and two out, and Mike Fetters retired him on a pop-up to
shortstop. Then the Orioles scored in the 11th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes even the best player loses a game,'' Urquiola said.
``This is a great show and I feel satisfied with our role, although
I would have liked to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in losing, though, the Cubans won.

DEFECTORS SCORNED BY CUBAN PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HAVANA _ They wouldn't be expected to say anything else or have
a different view, but to a man on Sunday, members of the Cuban
national team that played the Baltimore Orioles were critical of
the Cuban players who have defected to the United States and the
major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Moreno, the team's shortstop, used the Spanish word bravo
to describe his feelings. He did not use it meaning the connotation
the word has in English. In Spanish, bravo can also mean something
akin to teed off, although stronger. ``I'm angry,'' Moreno said,
``because they started in sports here in this country. We want to
show the whole world that a Cuban team can win against any other
team.''
</P>
<P>
   The players were asked how they felt about the absent players,
who include the Hernandez half-brothers, Orlando of the Yankees and
Livan of the Florida Marlins; Rey Ordonez of the Mets, Rolando
Arrojo of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and Osvaldo Fernandez of the San
Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   The players were also asked if they were envious of the major
league status and major league money the defectors have attained
and if they ever considered the move. None of them replied to the
last question. One, Andy Morales, didn't reply to any of the
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ask me that,'' he said. ``We're just players here.''
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Machado answered firmly: ``I'm 100 percent a
revolutionary,'' he said. ``I couldn't have done what they have
done because I want to play with my team all the time and defend
the colors of the Cuban flag. I like baseball. That's why I play,
not because of the money I get.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how much he earns, Machado said, ``All players have their
own workplaces where they get their money according to where they
work.'' He said he receives 200 pesos a month, which is less than
$20. Cuban players, however, also receive perks from the
government, like free housing, free education and, in some
instances, free cars.
</P>
<P>
   Yobal Duenas won the Cuban League batting championship this
season, but he didn't indicate any interest in learning if he could
do that against competition like Tony Gwynn or Bernie Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have taken their own road,'' he said of the defectors.
``I feel sorry for them. For myself, I'm here with my country and
my people and my family. I don't worry about money.''
</P>
<P>
   Michel Abreu said the subject ``really doesn't interest us,''
adding that ``they have taken that road and that is their
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Omar Linares, a five-time batting champion and one of the best
players Cuba has produced, is one player who could most likely have
become a good major league player. But he wanted no part of it, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't seem comfortable discussing the issue but said:
``Those who have gone have gone. They took that path. They are
products of the revolution.'' &QL;

<P>
   The e-mail messages from Yugoslavia spill forth by the
thousands, each freighted with a miniature etching of life under
the bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as big as a house _ the peasants had gone into the hole
and were looking around,'' a woman wrote from near the town of
Sabac, in southern Serbia, describing a bomb crater to Dr. Krinka
Petrov, a literature professor at the University of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone said it was made by a bomb launched from one of those
invisible airplanes because it was so big. The man whose cornfield
this was said he was going to charge tickets for those who wanted
to see the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first instance of warfare where a small but
significant slice of the population has Internet access. The
Yugoslavs, a technically savvy group for decades, have used the Web
to create an entire news network consisting of e-mail exchanges,
chat rooms and bulletin boards _ where no rumor is too small to
dissect at length and almost no hamlet too remote to mention.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the diaspora community, not sated by 24-hour cable
television news, catch themselves hunched over their computer
screens for five, six, seven hours a day, trolling for reports from
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes if I log on in the middle of the night, the people
over there are giving me a play-by-play thing,'' said Momir
Milinovich, a 27-year-old law student at the University of Illinois
at Urbana. ``They type things like `The bombs are flying right over
our heads.'''
</P>
<P>
   Those living through the bombing in Serbia often find e-mail
better than uneven international telephone lines as a means to
reassure loved ones that they are OK. It is also a way for them to
get around their state-controlled news media if they do not have
access to satellite television.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet's power to reassure equals its ability to
spread unease. Many Web correspondents who had been communicating
with ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province of Kosovo find that
their previous e-mail correspondents have fallen ominously silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling is that we are participating in this war in a
strange way because of the Internet,'' said Aleksander Slavkovic,
32, a computer engineer in Pittsburgh. ``You feel like you have
access to the information firsthand.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbian chat-room participants said that before the bombing
began, maybe 250 people would be logged on at once. Now as many as
1,500 people clog the chat rooms simultaneously. Each usually jumps
right in with an urgent appeal for news from his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Someone named Clo recently signed onto one of the chat rooms by
asking: ``Is there anyone from Kraljevo? Have they hit the airport?
Please tell me, my house is VERY close by.''
</P>
<P>
   Milinovich was frantic when he logged on last week. He had tried
calling his grandfather's house in the tiny Montenegran coastal
village of Moring unsuccessfully for days. A cousin in New York had
heard that the town barracks was hit in the first NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   When the law student posted a question in the chat room at
Montecafe.com, he got an instant answer. Dragan, a 20-year-old
college student, was tapping away in Risen, a town just four miles
down the road from Milinovich's family. (Most of the people
interviewed for this article insisted that at most the first names
of their correspondents be used, in case the Yugoslav government
cracks down on them.)
</P>
<P>
   Dragan told him that the nearest bombing was across the bay and
no civilian targets had been struck. He talked to Milinovich's
family and got back online to assure him that they were fine and
had shelter if the bombing got close.
</P>
<P>
   The Web often serves as a greater source of innuendo and
political screed than hard facts. The attacks on President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia have almost entirely evaporated as Serbs
feel obligated to back their government during a war. But nothing
spreads rumors faster than having thousands of people chattering
around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the uneven quality of the information, those online say
the Web tends to have more detailed reports of which towns were hit
and suffered civilian casualties.

   Predrag Tosic, a 29-year-old graduate student in computer
science at the University of Illinois, left his computer behind
during a weekend trip to Milwaukee. ``I felt bad because in the
hotel room I had to rely on CNN for several days,'' he said.

<P>
   Inside Yugoslavia, CNN and other international all-news
television stations are available via satellite, but the government
has shut down B92, the main independent radio station broadcasting
from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Real Networks, a Seattle-based company that specializes in
distributing broadcasts over the Web, has since put the station
online. Mark Hall, a general manager for the firm, said the site
gets about 30,000 to 40,000 hits daily.

<P>
   But information coming from the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo has
dropped precipitously. Illyria, an Albanian-American newspaper
based in New York, used to receive 250 e-mail messages a day from
residents of Kosovo or from the bulletin boards to which it
subscribed.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, with widespread reports that the Serbians were
carrying out reprisal attacks in Kosovo, the newspaper got just two
e-mail messages. ``It is very frustrating to not know if your
family is alive or not,'' said Isuf Hajrizi, the editor.
</P>
<P>
   Kolec Traboini, 53, who left Albania in 1991 and now manages a
food store in Boston, has kept in contact with Kosovo via the
Internet for the past two years, in part to get material for a
newspaper column he writes. Since the bombing campaign started, he
has not heard from anyone directly despite several appeals. He
hopes his contacts are in hiding.
</P>
<P>
   For those sitting under the NATO bombs in Serbia, the Internet
is a welcome distraction.
</P>
<P>
   It is reassuring to be able to communicate with the outside
world, wrote Deana Srajber, a 29-year-old Web designer, in response
to an e-mail query from a newspaper reporter. ``With the Internet
we have the means of telling the world about how we feel about all
this,'' she wrote. ``The frustrating part is that the world seems
not to care how we feel.''

   HAVANA _ He wined and dined them, then he sat in the middle of
them at a baseball game Sunday. Fidel Castro was the perfect host.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fascinating experience,'' Commissioner Bud Selig said
Sunday. And that was before he sat next to the Cuban leader at the
game the Baltimore Orioles played against the Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   Castro hosted Selig, other baseball officials and assorted
owners and club officials at a four-hour dinner Saturday night. The
primary topic appeared to be baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about player development in the Dominican
Republic,'' said Sandy Alderson, an executive vice president of
Major League Baseball. ``He's very knowledgeable. He's very big on
details.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig said that Castro, a pitcher in his youth, talked about
pitching and other aspects of baseball. ``He talked about his
career,'' Selig said, ``but in all honesty he didn't build himself
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Coleman, the National League president, said politics
were not discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Castro visited both dugouts before the game on Sunday. ``He told
me this was a great baseball town, '' Manager Ray Miller said. ``He
said not to worry, you're playing in front of the greatest fans.''

EARNHARDT HONORS FALLEN FIREFIGHTER

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
FORT WORTH, Texas _ As Dale Earnhardt raced around Texas Motor
Speedway in the Primestar 500 yesterday, he paid tribute to one of
three firefighters killed in an arson blaze last month.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And with each lap, 24-year-old Steven Sanders was reminded of
how much his brother loved NASCAR racing _ and Earnhardt, in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders' brother, Garry, was killed Feb. 15 when the roof of the
Precious Faith Temple in Lake Worth collapsed on him and Fort Worth
firefighters Brian Collins and Phillip Dean.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a huge fan,'' Sanders said of his younger brother, who
was a volunteer for the Sansom Park Fire Department. ``He used to
wear his Dale Earnhardt cap to the station every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the fire, we left it in his locker.''
</P>
<P>
   When speedway officials heard how much Garry Sanders liked
Earnhardt, they asked the driver if Steven might serve as an
honorary member of the pit row fire and rescue crew.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt said yes, and placed a decal on the passenger side
dash of his No. 3 GM Goodwrench Chevrolet that read ``In memory of
Garry Sanders,'' A similar decal, adorned with a red fire helmet,
was on the back of the car. Earnhardt finished eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, as he waited for the race to start, Sanders, also a
Sansom Park volunteer firefighter, said his brother would have
loved to have been at the Primestar 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he'd be so mad at me for being here,'' Sanders said. ``We
grew up watching this guy \REarnhardt\S, so I know he'd be honored
by all of this.
</P>
<P>
   ``The support our family has received has just been
overwhelming. This just adds to it; it's unreal.'' nn

 WASHINGTON: very well.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Indeed, search-and-rescue teams are an integral part of any U.S.
combat operation around the world. And as the United States engages
in strategically murkier missions in places like the Balkans, Haiti
and Somalia, special operations forces are playing a more prominent
role.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the increased prominence of search-and-rescue
teams is that Shelton is former head of the military's commandos
and Cohen was instrumental as a senator in creating the Pentagon's
Special Operations Command.
</P>
<P>
   While Saturday's rescue was largely an Air Force affair, members
of other branches of the services and officers from other NATO
nations helped out, from flying air cover to providing intelligence
on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``They train as hard as anyone in the world, harder, in fact,
and that's the reason they were able to get into a hostile
environment and pull him out back to safety,'' Cohen said of the
rescuers Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   But late Saturday, it was far from certain that the mission
would end successfully. There were conflicting reports about
whether the plane, the first F-117 lost in combat, was shot down or
had crashed due to other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon aides knew within an hour after the plane was reported
missing that the pilot was alive. As part of their survival kit,
pilots carry emergency beacons. Aviators also carry special flares
that can emit smoke for daytime rescue and infra-red signals at
night that can be seen by rescue crews with night-vision goggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``During all of this,'' a senior Pentagon official said, ``the
rule we follow is, say nothing about this. The immediate concern is
getting the pilot back. We don't want to alert the other side we're
even looking. That's why we don't even announce a plane is down
until we know the fate of the pilot.''
</P>
<P>
   But at an undisclosed base in Bosnia, and at the NATO air
command center in Vicenza, Italy, officials were furiously
scrambling reconnaissance aircraft to home in on the pilot's
beacon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you know where he is, you look at a map,'' said a senior
Air Force officer who was involved in O'Grady's rescue. ``If you're
lucky, there's nothing much around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials would not disclose what specifically happened next in
Saturday's rescue. But once searchers identify the pilot's
location, they try to make voice contact with him using an
emergency transmitter. Pilots are equipped with camouflage gear,
but they must be wary of enemy troops that could be intercepting
the messages.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the rescue was carried out by the Air Force,
including some of the 150 troops and half a dozen specially
equipped helicopters sent to the Balkans last week from Hurlburt
Field, Fla., the headquarters of the Air Force Special Operations
Command.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force rescuers undergo 18 months of intensive sea, air
and land rescue training, with an emphasis on survival techniques.
Only about 15 percent of the applicants make the cut. There are
about 400 search-and-rescue specialists in the Air Force or Air
Force reserves. They are among the troops most heavily in demand in
today's military.
</P>
<P>
   To safely snatch the F-117 pilot, rescuers relied on two types
of specially equipped helicopters. The MH-60G Pave Hawks and the
much larger MH-53J Pave Lows are designed to infiltrate enemy
territory undetected at low levels in all weather conditions, to
extract or resupply U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
   The Pave Lows were among the first aircraft into Iraq during the
1991 Persian Gulf War, when they cleared the way of enemy air
defenses for Army Apache attack helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Both helicopters, which operated extensively in the Gulf War,
are armed with cannons and smaller weapons mounted on the cabin
windows.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the rescue preparations unfolded in the Balkans,
Pentagon and White House aides waited helplessly. At about 5
o'clock, a senior Pentagon aide said he recalled asking Shelton,
``How long is it going to be?'' Shelton replied, ``We just have no
way of knowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, O'Grady evaded capture for six days, scrounging for
water (even wringing a few drops of rainwater from his wool socks)
and digging for ants to eat.
</P>
<P>
   But the F-117 pilot was more fortunate. A few hours after
Shelton's remarks, the downed aviator had dashed to a waiting
helicopter and its hovering escorts.

IT'S DUKE _ AS IN NUKE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Once UConn is long gone and the Dookies hold a
reunion on NBA All-Star Saturday trying to decide their place in
history, the question will undoubtedly come up:
</P>
<P>
   If we were such a nasty dynasty, why didn't we have a nickname?
</P>
<P>
   Other coaches might offer up ``12 Things I Hate About Duke.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Coach K's Cult'' might be more apropos.
</P>
<P>
   (By the way, y'ever notice the parallels in the movies
``Pinocchio'' and ``Frankenstein''?)
</P>
<P>
   For a team whose only real weakness is it can't spell its
coach's name _ but who can? _ they've played like some sort of
Andromeda-strained Wacos, scientific mutations of domination during
a time when parity was supposed to have squashed all forms of the
John Wooden era.
</P>
<P>
   When the players enter the gym, they get an iris scan. Those
crop circles along Tobacco Road didn't come from some drunken John
Deere driver.
</P>
<P>
   What Satanic verses may these Be'Devils be chanting? And did
Mike Krzyzewski really build that sand sculpture of Tropicana Field
on his own?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe those Nike commercials with tournament-infected
mitochondrions aren't that far-fetched. . . .
</P>
<P>
   _CBS can't show enough of those shots in the stands of ``Martial
Law'' co-star Sammo Hung. Unless Craig Kilborn has something else
to promote. . . .
</P>
<P>
   _And if ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' so much, why does he get
shoved back to 10 p.m. tonight? . . .
</P>
<P>
   _By the way, the women's lacrosse and women's tennis teams at
Duke are ranked !ital!only No. 2 in the country. . . .
</P>
<P>
   _One more overbudget flop of a game and the Lakers change their
name to ``Waterworld.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   _Great April Fool's joke Dennis Rodman can play Thursday: Show
up for practice, and actually participate. . . .
</P>
<P>
   _The only non-NBA work Rodman has seemed to garner lately is a
role on CBS' ``L.A. Doctors,'' which will air sometime . . . never?
. . .
</P>
<P>
   Isn't there a Tae-Bo tape he can make a cameo in? . . .
</P>
<P>
   _1150 down: Four-letter word, starts with a ``Z.'' Clue is:
Latest Arbitron rating. . . .
</P>
<P>
   _With the Cactus League MVP race apparently out of his reach, we
can now say we'd pass on another Garth Brooks attempt at a swinging
bunt and listen to Jack McDowell spank a Stratocaster instead. . .
.
</P>
<P>
   _Had the Angels kept Sparky Anderson as their colorman, it's
unlikely he'd make it for the season opener. He's taking it easy at
his Thousand Oaks home these days, recovering from a perforated
ulcer that had a lot of family members kinda worried. . . .
</P>
<P>
   _The fact the Baltimore Orioles made it out of Cuba with a few
cigars stuffed in their duffle bags and without Albert Belle
starting an international incident would seem to make the trip a
success. But the more we hear from those opposed to this
exhibition, and the more we see pictures of Fidel Castro smiling
alongside Bud Selig, the more this made us too queasy to continue
watching. . . .
</P>
<P>
   _Gary McCord plans to produce a movie on the life of noted
gambling golfer ``Titanic'' Thompson. Rack up a few more
playoff-extended wins on the Senior PGA Tour and the CBS prankster
will have his own life story to sell. . . .
</P>
<P>
   _The cover of the April issue of Sport magazine advertises an
``EXCLUSIVE: O.J. TELLS ALL'' story inside just begging to be read.
The editors have obviously never seen a tabloid. In this two-page
transcript of a Q-and-A buried on page 88 of the 96-page mag, the
only real juice squeezed from Juice is that he uses the analogy
that ``if the shoe fits, it should fit for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The interviewer reminds him it's probably not a good idea to use
that line, you know, about shoes fitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right,'' answers Simpson. ``And I can't use `Kill two birds
with one stone' either.''
</P>
<P>
   Juice then laughs. &QL;

 &HT;    Black market dolls not what they seem
 &HT;    By Henry Farber
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The August sun scorched the Atlanta shopping center's
pavement, and Gail Gross was feeling the heat.
</P>
<P>
   The 42-year-old mother of two carried a wad of $100 bills in her
purse, looking for a man she'd met only over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a fellow with a goatee waved from a Grand Cherokee.
</P>
<P>
   She introduced herself. He seemed impatient, and stood
uncomfortably close as he showed her the goods on the floorboard of
his Jeep. ``He said he was afraid somebody was going to steal
them,'' she recalled later.
</P>
<P>
   Gross had never done this before. It felt uncomfortable, but she
went through with the deal. She doled out $1,475 in cash.
</P>
<P>
   And he handed her nine Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
   Or so she thought.
</P>
<P>
   This month, a judge declared the little dolls from last year's
deal to be bogus Beanies. Cuddly but counterfeit. Unfit to be Ty.
</P>
<P>
   Gross has been promised her money back from the seller, thanks
to her persistence in small-claims court _ and the fact that she
brought to the witness stand an expert in Beanie Baby counterfeits.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after marketing wiz Ty Warner gave birth to the first
of his creations, Beanie Baby mania is still going strong _ so
strong that the marketplace is being flooded by knock-offs and
fakes. Gross and fellow collectors resent having to inspect their
pellet-filled playthings to make sure they're the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, they have authentic-looking neck tags with the cutesy names
given each model, such as ``Bubbles'' and ``Coral'' and ``Ears.''
</P>
<P>
   But if they're not really made by Ty Inc., they're no more
valuable than, well, a bag of beans. The problem is such that
collectors can attend seminars on spotting counterfeits.
</P>
<P>
   Victims say the problem has contributed to a softening of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   In the Neverland that is the Beanie Baby marketplace,
authenticity is everything. Not just any six-inch stuffed critter
will do.
</P>
<P>
   But let's back up a minute.
</P>
<P>
   How could there be a market for a few inches of cloth stuffed
with plastic? And why in the wide world of collectibles would
anybody pay $164 (Gross's average price that day) for one of them,
much less an armful?
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable thing is that Gross would have been getting a
good deal if the dolls had been real.
</P>
<P>
   The Beanie known as ``Britannia,'' a bear with a Union Jack on
his chest, was going for $400 last summer. In the parking lot last
year, Gross bought two at that price. ``Garcia,'' a tie-dyed bear
created in memory of the leader of the Grateful Dead, was selling
for $175, so she thought she was doing well when she paid $100.
</P>
<P>
   These are not store-shelf prices. Ty Inc. recommends a $5 price
tag for all Beanies. What jacks up the value is the secondary
market for pre-owned models. The company produces them in limited
editions (Ty's famous ``retirement'' system), and the intense
demand immediately makes them collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's human nature to want things that aren't readily
available,'' said Gina Greene, the self-trained Beanie detective
who testified in court that Gross's purchases were counterfeits.
``I've seen elderly people who spend their Social Security checks
on them.''
</P>
<P>
   For almost three years, Gross bought almost every Beanie that
came out, usually paying $5 to $9 at stores. The most she has paid
for a used one was $325 for Lefty the Donkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've waited two hours in line to buy them,'' she said. But
what happened last summer almost burst her bubble.
</P>
<P>
   The day after her parking lot purchase, she took her new
additions to a weekly Beanie swap meet. Trained Beanie inspectors
there told her she'd been swindled.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to tell the difference, but a comparison showed that
the fake Britannia's nose stuck out too far. The eyes were a bit
big. The neck ribbon wasn't equally shiny on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   So she called back to complain to Greg Kozar, the man who'd
placed the classified ad before they met in the parking lot. His
response astounded her. He knew they were counterfeits.
</P>
<P>
   The next time she saw him, March 4, was in night court for
small-claims cases.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Richard Faber ruled that Kozar committed breach of
contract. Faber said he couldn't have ruled without Greene's expert
testimony as a Beanie detective. He doesn't know a Ty Beanie from a
teddy bear.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's order: Kozar must pay back $1,526, including
interest, and he gets his fake Beanies back.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Kozar has appealed to State Court, but said last
week he has ordered his lawyer to pay in full.
</P>
<P>
   Kozar, who describes himself as a free-lance salesman, was
contacted by phone page on a golf course. He denied trying to
deceive Gross, saying he told her stuffed animals were counterfeits
when she bought them. She knew she was getting a bargain and wanted
to resell them for a bundle, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Absurd, Gross said. She didn't want to profit from her purchase.
She wanted to give them to her daughter for Christmas, she said.
</P>
<P>
   If she's in it for the money, why has she held onto 200 of them?
They nearly cover the wall in her 10-year-old daughter Shannan's
bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Ty Inc., a notoriously media-shy company, didn't respond to
inquiries about the counterfeiting problem. But collectors said the
company has little incentive to go after knock-offs. After all, Ty
profits only from new models. By the time bootleg producers make
copies, Ty already has ``retired'' the model, or stopped
production.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Faber's advice: ``If you're buying something that's not
valuable for its intrinsic value _ but is valuable as a collector's
item _ have an expert look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words: Beanie buyer, beware.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Jake Voskuhl said he was determined to leave
the Lone Star State to go to college because Texas is football
country and he needed to go where basketball was king.
<TEXT>

   The decision to head north to Connecticut three years ago gave
Voskuhl almost all he wanted.

freshman year, when the Longhorns advanced to the Sweet 16 of the
NCAA Tournament while his Huskies failed to make the field.

at Strake Jesuit, has been getting closer to getting all he wants

   Connecticut might have been bumped from the Elite Eight by North
Carolina last season, but tonight when they take the court against
Duke, Voskuhl and his fellow Huskies can capture it all. They are
only 40 minutes of basketball away from being national champions.
</P>
<P>
   One slight problem: Duke is the overwhelming favorite to claim
the national title, and, worse yet, Voskuhl matches up with Elton
Brand, who has been capturing national player-of-the-year honors on
an almost-daily basis for the past couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Voskuhl gets to live his lifelong dream, yet may suffer through
his worst nightmare at the same time. It is like hoping for rain
and then finding yourself in a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the matchup everyone's really been looking
forward to,'' Voskuhl said. ``This is the matchup the media and the
fans have wanted because we don't play each other during the year.
You guys wanted it; now you got it.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Voskuhl really wanted it, he's got it, too.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Brand, a 6-8, 260-pound sophomore who posts like a center,
rebounds like a power forward and runs the floor like a small
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Voskuhl, on the other hand, is a plodding, workmanlike 6-11,
245-pound junior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that with a player like him you can't really say
you're going to stop him and he's not going to do anything,''
Voskuhl said of Brand. ``You just have to try to contain him and
hope he doesn't really go off on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Voskuhl stands to get a lot of help from teammates in an effort
to keep Brand from going off. According to Brand, he had better get
some help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think the best thing to do would be to double-team
me,'' Brand said. ``When I see a man-to-man matchup, my eyes light
up. I feel I can either score, get fouled or find someone open. So
double-teaming me would be the best situation.''
</P>
<P>
   UConn coach Jim Calhoun was reluctant to reveal his defensive
game plan, but it will be no surprise if the Huskies send several
players at Brand to keep him in check.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our thing is to get the ball down low to Elton, and I think
everybody knows that,'' Duke's Trajan Langdon said. ``So that is
where you have to start your defensive focus, but we have a lot of
weapons and double-teaming Elton opens up a lot of things for other
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody we have played came in thinking of stopping Elton,
but they leave Shane (Battier) open and he hits a couple of 3s, or
I'll hit one or two, and there goes that plan.''
</P>
<P>
   So maybe Calhoun will do the unthinkable and ask Voskuhl to
handle Brand straight up. Not likely. He says any team playing Duke
has to pick its poison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to make some decisions,'' Calhoun said. ``Are
we going to go big to double, who is it going to come from, and
where is it going to come from?''
</P>
<P>
   Voskuhl said he feels no added pressure in taking on a player
with Brand's credentials, but he knows the task will be a tough
one.
</P>
<P>
   To be effective, the first thing Voskuhl will have to do is
avoid foul trouble, which has dogged him of late. He played only 19
minutes before fouling out against Ohio State in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Brand was in foul trouble in the Blue Devils' semifinal victory
over Michigan State as well, but in the four Tournament games prior
to the Final Four, Voskuhl had been whistled for 15 fouls to only
seven for Brand.
</P>
<P>
   Voskuhl takes the lighter side in evaluating that difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he's just getting calls and I'm not,'' he kidded. ``But
seriously, it's very important for me to be out there. I just have
to play smarter, really.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to play solid. I think he (Brand) has proven he
can score on anybody in the country. Just to foul him is maybe not
going to be the most intelligent thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Voskuhl, who had only two points against Ohio State and has
scored nine points or fewer in 19 games, hopes to contribute on the
offensive end to combat Brand's production.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important to make players play both ends of the
court,'' Voskuhl said. ``If one guy all he has to do is play
offense and doesn't play very much defense _ not saying that he
doesn't _ it helps him out. It gives him more energy and gets his
team pumped up. He's kind of like the heart of their team, and when
he's playing really well, they're really on top of their game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elton Brand is Elton Brand; there's not a lot of players like
him. He does everything well.''
</P>
<P>
   Matchups like these are why he came to Connecticut, Voskuhl
says. It is part of his dream.
</P>
<P>
   How he fares against Brand may determine if the game becomes
part of a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thinks Duke is going to win,'' Voskuhl said. ``But
you can't count out the Huskies, that's all I know. I know my team;
I know everything we've been through. We get our opportunity
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a kid, everyone dreams about something like this. You
always play something like this in your head, so now's your chance
to really do it.''

 &HT;    Duval tops with TPC win
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ After a week when luck and looniless
ruled at the TPC of Sawgrass, in the end all made perfect sense.
The advance storyline became the story. All is right and logical
with David Duval's beautiful, bentgrass world.
</P>
<P>
   He's finally No. 1 without an argument. And, no, Duval doesn't
have a major championship yet, but now he's got the next best
thing. Something even better than his round of 59.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old Duval, a Jacksonville native who camped at the
practice range bleachers at the TPC at Sawgrass since he was 12 and
collected caps scribbled with autographs, dreaming about someday
making a living inside the ropes, is running out of non-major
worlds to conquer.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Tech alumnus captured The Players Championship and
its $900,000 first prize Sunday, closing with a 2-over-par 73 for a
72-hole score of 3-under-par 285 that beat Scott Gump (71), who won
$540,000, by two strokes. Duval's third victory this year pushed
his earnings to $2,148,300. Not bad with the Masters still two
weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been coming to this for years,'' Duval said. ``And, to be
honest, I don't know if I have thought I was going to win here.
Obviously, I dreamt about it and thought about it, but I'm not
going to tell you I thought I was going to win this golf
tournament. I thought it would be a very, very difficult thing to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   And if anyone wanted more to the scenario, David's father, Bob,
completed the historical day by capturing his first win at the
Senior PGA Tour's Emerald Coast Classic Sunday in Pensacola.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's as proud of me as I am of him,'' Dad Duval said in
Pensacola.
</P>
<P>
   Countered David, ``I think I would win that award as who was
most proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price's 73 earned $340,000 for third at even-par 288. Fred
Couples, who after a Thursday 77 was just trying to get his aching
back through four rounds, shot a 68 _ the lowest round of the
weekend _ to tie for fourth ($220,000) with Hal Sutton (73).
</P>
<P>
   Grinning and atypically gleeful, Duval moved to No. 1 in the
rankings, passing Tiger Woods, who spent 41 weeks at the top. Had
Woods parred the 18th, instead of making bogey on a vicious slash
from the pine straw to the lake, he would have tied for sixth and
retained No.1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wonderful week,'' Duval said. ``I'm very proud of
myself today how I played. . . .I'm kind of anxious to see tapes of
this. It really must have been brutal looking.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to rock-hard greens and nasty rough, conditions never
even approached the simple range, but Duval handled them better
than anyone else. So much for discussions about the identity of the
world's best player. Duval beat golf's strongest field _ 49 of the
top 50 players on the world rankings _ and won his 10th tournament
in the last 32 events. Nicklausian stuff, to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   Although the greens had been watered slightly and winds calmed
down somewhat Sunday, holding off a return to Saturday's silliness,
the final round still became a time to embrace pars and accept a
few bogeys. But while most everyone else in golf was made to look
foolish by Sawgrass' harsh set-pup, Duval kept his game together.
Even after bogeys at 14 and 15 sliced his lead over Gump to one
shot, Duval said he never questioned that he would win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't concerned at all,'' he said. ``I knew other people
were going to make them.''
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, Sawgrass' scary island 17th would ultimately
determine whether a guy with the same name as the county where he
gets his mail (Duval) would prevail, or the fellow they call
``Forrest'' would soil the final chapter. As it evolved, Gump's
8-iron at the 17th hit back-middle of the green and scooted off the
back into the water for an eventual double-bogey 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had 137 to carry,'' Gump said. ``I would have had to step on
a 9-iron. I just choked down on (the 8-iron), really smoothed it.
Unfortunately, as soon as I hit it, I pretty much knew it was in
the water. I was trying to hit a little cut, and I killed it.''
</P>
<P>
   The hero, however, would make no such gaffe at the 17. Duval's
pitching wedge came to rest six feet from the cup. He sank the putt
for a birdie to return to 3-under. Equally valuable was Duval's
fluffy wedge from behind the green at the 18th to a foot to save
par, but the 17th could have ruined everything in a few seconds.
Remembering how he once saw Nick Price just walk up boldly and
strike the same shot to win in 1993, Duval put the image to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best shot I've ever seen played,'' Duval said. ``He
walked up there, grabbed his club, stood over the ball and hit it.
He never gave himself enough time to think about anything other
than hitting it up there close. That's all I tried to do was grab
the club and hit it.''

(ATTN: N.C.)  
 BASKETBALL COLUMN: DUKE HAS BECOME A TEAM YOU CAN ROOT FOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Who would have guessed at the beginning
of the decade that by the end of it Duke, an elite private
university in North Carolina, would have a basketball team that
could be heralded as The People's Team? Just goes to show how time
can alter images and perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Duke began the decade by playing for the national championship
in April 1990. This was the time when the great yoke around coach
Mike Krzyzewski's neck was that he had been to the Final Four three
times without winning the title. And that night, Nevada-Las Vegas
defeated Duke by 30 points, the widest margin of any National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament championship game.
</P>
<P>
   I felt bad for the Duke players who had to suffer through a loss
like that, and I even empathized with Krzyzewski. But there was
also satisfaction that UNLV had played flawlessly, with speed and
intelligence, counteracting a contrived media representation that
put Duke as the force of light and UNLV as the force of darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Carrawell was 13 years old at the time. He watched the
UNLV-Duke game at home in north St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1990, I was happy they lost,'' he said. ``I hated Duke as
well. What you hated was that they were that good. You wondered how
they beat all those good teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they did was study. How could they have high GPAs and
still win?''
</P>
<P>
   Nine years later Carrawell is a junior and a key part of a team
that may be one of best in college basketball history, one that
will play Connecticut Monday night for the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I was a little surprised they recruited a guy like me
who comes from a different background,'' Carrawell said. ``But I
jumped at the opportunity. Coach K went out and recruited me, he
came to my house, came to the inner city. He could relate.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke's aura wasn't merely a matter of class, but also of
attitude. Shane Battier, Duke's sophomore forward, attended prep
school in Michigan. He didn't like Duke, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like everyone else in the country,'' Battier said. ``I
thought they were a country-club team, with stuck-up players who
thought they were too big for their britches.''
</P>
<P>
   What turned Battier around was not a recruiting visit but a
frailty. When Krzyzewski had back surgery and sat out for most of
the 1994-95 season _ Duke had a losing record that season _ Battier
looked at Duke and Krzyzewski differently. ``I guess I realized
that he was human, like you or I,'' Battier said. He took his
visit, met the coach, ``saw his passion and intensity to be the
best'' and he met some of the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were cocky because they were good,'' Battier said, ``not
good because they were cocky.''
</P>
<P>
   This team doesn't have that air, but it has that edge. ``This
team doesn't have the brash arrogance of the early 1990s team,''
Battier said. ``We just have confidence every time we walk out on
the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the teams in the nation, Connecticut was the only one
that entered the tournament with a chance for an upset. And make no
mistake about it, a UConn victory would be an upset. Both teams
have deep benches, skilled players. Both teams wear blue.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Duke won with finesse. Pricked you with little pins
and made opponents die a hundred deaths. This 37-1 team has the
weight of an anvil and the power of a sledgehammer. This accounts
for the grass-roots popularity of the team, the presence of
Carrawell, William Avery and Elton Brand.
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski adjusts. The formula he used at the beginning of the
decade has been modified to fit trends and times. You can't win a
national championship sitting in an ivory tower; you can't win one
sitting in prison, either. There is a wide middle ground, and it
was crucial for Duke to find the Carrawells and Averys.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe a player has a tattoo, wears an earring and a cap
turned backward and talks with an edge. Walks with a swagger. All
that has nothing to do with character, with right and wrong or work
ethic.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun called Krzyzewski the perfect
coach for the '90s; Krzyzewski said that he has simply adjusted.
Maybe the year off had something to do with it, maybe it was the
thought of his program slipping. Who knows? It could have been that
30-point loss in 1990. Whatever the catalyst for change, Duke is
rolling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand things better now,'' Krzyzewski said, ``having
gone through a bunch of things.''
</P>
<P>
   As the decade comes to an end, UNLV has virtually slipped from
the national scene. Its coach at the time, Jerry Tarkanian, now at
Fresno State, is still like the bandit running from the posse; in
the last two seasons, players in his program have been tainted with
allegations of point shaving.
</P>
<P>
   Duke's foundation has never wavered, it has merely expanded.
``The fans are not fans of winning,'' Krzyzewski said, ``they're
fans of our team.''
</P>
<P>
   As Carrawell left the arena Sunday, he thought about the arc of
feelings that had him hating Duke in 1990 and loving it in 1999. He
grew up surrounded by underprivilege; now, in a classic exchange of
talent for exposure, he is surrounded by privilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Duke; I didn't think I would,'' he said. ``When I go
home and come back, it's like getting away. Not that I don't love
where I come from. I just like Duke a little bit better.''

 &HT;    Terry Labonte homes in for win in Texas
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Terry Labonte couldn't have said it better
himself: Don't mess with Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the native son from Corpus Christi, won the Primestar
500 with more than a little encouragement from many of the 200,000
fans at Texas Motor Speedway, including the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stopped by to see the Labonte boys this morning and I told
them good luck,'' Gov. George W. Bush said. ``They said they didn't
need any more pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end, Labonte passed Dale Jarrett with 11 laps remaining
in the 334-lap race and won it under caution when Jimmy Spencer's
car hit the frontstretch wall on lap 330. The scene, Labonte said,
was ``awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the crowd and they were all standing up cheering (during
the final caution laps),'' Labonte said. ``All the other drivers
pulled up beside me and congratulated me. That's a good feeling.
When you don't win a lot of races like some of these other guys do,
guys will do that.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Labonte's first victory since last fall at Richmond, 26
races ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this is the biggest race I've ever won,'' he said. He
was at the track's groundbreaking four years ago; now he knows what
victory lane looks like.
</P>
<P>
   He got a chance to experience it by pushing his No. 5 Chevrolet
past Jarrett's No. 88 Ford late in the race, by being in front when
Spencer's crash brought out the eighth caution of the day, and by
avoiding the tire troubles that accounted for five cars going into
various walls.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte was running in the top four most of the day but mounted
his big charge after Jarrett had led from laps 285-322.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to get by him on the outside over there in (turn)
2,'' Labonte said of an earlier attempt to take the lead. ``I
really wasn't up to his door. I was up to his quarter-panel and I
was hoping his spotter was going to say 'There's somebody on your
outside.' I could tell he didn't see me, so I had to get out of the
gas there and try again.''
</P>
<P>
   He got the break he needed on lap 323, when Jarrett was slowed
by the lapped cars of Robert Pressley and Kenny Irwin. ``I was
wearing his tires out, I wasn't wearing (Jarrett) out,'' Labonte
said. ``The groove had come in pretty good. I was surprised to get
a run off turn four and get by him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that maybe if I could use up enough race track I
could keep Terry behind me,'' Jarrett said, ``but the lapped cars
were wanting to stay on the lead lap, I guess. As I caught one of
them in three and four, my car pushed up as I tried to get back in
the throttle and that hurt me then. Terry just got up high and got
a run to the outside and there was nothing I could do after that.''
</P>
<P>
   The tires may have as much to do with the outcome of the race as
lapped traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Contenders Jeff Gordon, Mike Skinner and Mark Martin lost
control and went into the wall, separately, apparently because of
tire trouble. Gordon ended up 43rd with bruised ribs, Skinner was
42nd and broke a shoulder. Martin, who wrecked while leading on lap
217, had his car patched up and back on the track, finishing 34th.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear, which supplies the tires, blamed the track conditions
and the absence of a happy hour practice session Saturday for the
incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``(This is) basically a brand new track compared to last year,''
said Phil Holmer, Goodyear's marketing manager for stock car
racing. ``Teams didn't have the critical Saturday afternoon hour
practice due to rain.''

   WASHINGTON _ The brutal Serbian campaign against ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo appears aimed at emptying the province of the
majority of its people and is on the verge of creating a monumental
refugee crisis, NATO and American officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet NATO officials also suggested that the air assaults against
Serbia may not be enough to stop Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic from achieving his goal as his army, police, paramilitary
forces and armed civilians continued to sweep across Kosovo in a
reported rampage of mass executions, torched villages and the
forced eviction of ethnic Albanians to neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the brink of a major humanitarian disaster in
Kosovo, the likes of which have not been seen in Europe since the
closing stages of World War II,'' Jamie Shea, the spokesman for
NATO in Brussels said Sunday morning. He said Milosevic was trying
to irreversibly empty Kosovo of its ethnic Albanian inhabitants
and, in the process, send them over the borders to subvert
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said NATO was in a ``race against time.''
</P>
<P>
   Other NATO officials involved in military planning said Sunday
that constraints being imposed by NATO's civilian leaders were
preventing the allied air forces from hitting at the heart of
Milosevic's military forces. The civilian leaders of NATO want to
use ``gentleman's club rules against a man who was practicing
genocide,'' one NATO military planner said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the planner said, the civilian leaders had ruled
out attacking the Belgrade headquarters where Milosevic's military
lieutenants were planning operations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Ambassador to Croatia Peter Galbraith said Sunday
that the current air campaign might eventually cripple Milosevic's
ability to wage war but could leave Kosovo ``an empty square.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is he's accelerated greatly and we don't have a
way to stop it,'' Galbraith said. ``This will not be a triumph if
we've destroyed their equipment but Kosovo is empty.''
</P>
<P>
   Galbraith said he believed that the use of NATO ground troops
might be the only way to halt Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   According to NATO, Milosevic was using the Tigers, a
paramilitary volunteer force led by Zeljko Raznjatovic, also known
as Arkan, in his Kosovo drive. The Tigers were considered one of
the most brutal units in the Bosnian war, where they drove around
in jeeps, executed people with pistols and rifles and then looted
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   One NATO official said that allied aircraft could eventually
attack the 300 or so tanks that the Yugoslav Army was using in
Kosovo, but that it was almost impossible to attack the Tigers,
armed civilians or other paramilitary groupings.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a public campaign to maintain popular support in the
United States for the NATO air strikes, Clinton Administration
officials _ including Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger _ talked on television
Sunday of Milosevic's stepped-up efforts to clear the ethnic
Albanians from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the American officials condemned Milosevic as
strongly as British Secretary of State for Defense George
Robertson, who spoke of the Yugoslav leader's ``murderous campaign
in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said that reports from ethnic Albanian refugees who
had escaped over the borders were enough to ``convince us that we
are confronting a regime which is intent on genocide.''
</P>
<P>
   At NATO headquarters, Shea said Milosevic's ``scorched earth
policy'' against the ethnic Albanians ranged across all of Kosovo,
with ``wholesale ethnic cleansing'' taking place in five towns _
Lekovac, Podujevo, Srbica, Malisevo and Dakovica.
</P>
<P>
   As an illustration that Milosevic's operations were not only
confined to the central Drenica area, which is the stronghold of
the guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army, but encompassed the
whole province, NATO officials said that Serb forces were creating
a buffer zone about six miles wide along the Albanian border. This
was being accomplished by emptying and then burning villages along
that swath of territory.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days, 50,000 people have been uprooted from
their homes, making a total of 500,000 ethnic Albanian refugees
since the conflict started 14 months ago, NATO officials said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the Albanian border, Shea said, Serbian border guards were
stripping refugees fleeing into Albania of their identity documents
and license plates, testifying to Milosevic's determination to get
rid of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups said they were continuing to receive
accounts of executions of whole families and of the separation of
men from women. They stressed again Sunday that it was still very
difficult to verify the reports, including some that thousands of
ethnic Albanians were being used as human shields at Serb military
installations.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO official said more precise information was hard to come
by because there had been unspecified ``technical' difficulties in
launching the Predator, an unmanned spy plane specially developed
to transmit images of activities on the ground as they take place.
</P>
<P>
   The Predator would not be airborne over Kosovo for another day
or two, the NATO official said. Other imagery from satellites and
high flying unmanned aircraft was being used primarily for
targeting and assessing bomb damage, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   There were continued reports Sunday of widespread fires and
forced expulsions by police in the Kosovo town of Pec. Some of the
refugees arriving in Montenegro said the Serbian police in Pec had
spread the word that the remaining ethnic Albanian population there
would be forced to board buses Monday to take them to the
Montenegro border.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Sunday night that
15,000 ethnic Albanians had crossed into Albania in the last 24
hours. A spokesman for the agency, Panos Moumtzis, said there were
no men in the group between the ages of 16 and 60, and many young
women were being kept behind in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kosovo capital, Pristina, several residents who reached
relatives abroad reported that families were being expelled from
their apartments and collected in the city stadium. The head of the
Kosovo Crisis Group in London, Bajram Gecaj, said that the dean of
the School of Medicine in Pristina, Alush Gashi, had been executed.
</P>
<P>
   The whereabouts of Ibrahim Rugova, the pacifist leader of the
ethnic Albanians for the last decade, and of Veton Surroi, a
prominent newspaper publisher, remained unknown. They were presumed
to be hiding.

BAD BREAKS AT TMS CONTINUE FOR SKINNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHARD TIJERINA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Two races at Texas Motor Speedway, two
crashes into unforgiving walls and two broken bones. Mike Skinner
must be feeling a bit snake-bitten.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner, who only two weeks ago was leading the NASCAR Winston
Cup points standings, continued his drop yesterday. He dropped from
fifth to ninth in the points race for the Winston Cup championship
after crashing into the Turn 1 wall on the 124th lap of the
Primestar 500 at TMS.
</P>
<P>
   All Skinner wanted was to somehow drive his battered No. 31
Lowe's Chevrolet back onto the track. But his crew could not repair
the damage, which was extensive to the front and right side of the
car.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner never saw his car being repaired because doctors were
working on his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   It was an all-too-familiar sight, seeing Skinner crash into a
wall at TMS and emerge with a broken bone and a shattered car. He
bowed out of last year's race here in similar fashion, making him
one hard-luck driver, at least in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like a motorcycle rider: I'm learning how to crash,'' said
Skinner, who suffered a hairline fracture in his right shoulder
blade.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, the culprit was Skinner's right front tire. It blew
out, causing him to crash into the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fluttered a little bit,'' Skinner said. ``I don't know what
the deal is, but I'll be all right. It's a good thing we have a
week off. We healed up before and we'll heal up again.''
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks ago, Skinner was on top of the NASCAR world.
After two fourth-place finishes and two sixths in his first four
races, Skinner was the points leader entering last week's TranSouth
Financial 400 in Darlington, S.C. But his 32nd-place finish there
dropped him to fifth place, going into the Primestar 500.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, he finished 42nd. He has a week off to think about
his downward slide in the standings and to figure out what may be
wrong with his car.
</P>
<P>
   When he crashed, he was flirting with a top-10 finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no warning, no nothing,'' Skinner said. ``The car
was running great and then, all of a sudden, we were into the wall.
... The sad part is that I have experience with this. I think we
had a top-five car today.''
</P>
<P>
   The tire woes left crew chief Larry McReynolds, well, tired.
Skinner told his crew to attempt to fix the car's damage, but it
was too severe to get back into the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've got now is a bunch of junk,'' McReynolds said.
``Just when you start thinking your tire problems are behind you,
they come back to get you.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew \RJeff\S Gordon had problems earlier, and we agreed
that with this track being green, `Let's just see what we had
because the car was a little tight at the start.' But the wear
looked good and the pressure buildup wasn't that bad, and those are
all the things you look for when you blow a tire.''

 &HT;    Place in history at stake for Duke
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ It's one thing to be playing for a
national championship. It's another to be playing for your place in
history. That's what Duke (37-1) will have on the line tonight when
it meets Connecticut (33-2) in the title game of the NCAA
Tournament at Tropicana Field.
</P>
<P>
   The adjectives to describe this Duke team have long ago been
exhausted. The Blue Devils have a 32-game winning streak, their
only loss coming to Cincinnati on Nov. 28. Only five times in 38
games has Duke failed to win by a double-digit margin.
</P>
<P>
   Even after a six-point victory against Michigan State (68-62) in
Saturday's semifinals, the Blue Devils have won their past 14 games
by an average of 26.9 points.
</P>
<P>
   If Duke wins tonight, it would set an NCAA record for most
victories in a season. Only two other teams _ Duke's team of 1986
(37-3) and UNLV in 1987 (37-2) _ have matched this team's current
win total.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that Duke is the best team in the
country. No question at all,'' UConn coach Jim Calhoun said. ``They
could be one of the best teams of all-time.''
</P>
<P>
   But without a national championship to cap a truly remarkable
and dominating season, Duke could be relegated to the list of great
teams that came up short of college basketball's ultimate goal.
Among them are Houston in 1983 (31-3), Georgetown in 1985 (35-3),
UNLV in 1991 (34-1) and Kansas of 1997 (34-2). Fair or not, Duke
will go to the top of that list should it lose tonight to the
Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mike Krzyzewski says he's not concerned about this Duke
team's place in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what happens, we have had a truly wonderful season,
one that none of us will never forget,'' said Krzyzewski, who will
be going for this third national championship. ``This has been a
wonderful team.''
</P>
<P>
   UConn, however, IS concerned about its place in history. The
Huskies, in their first national championship game ever, are the
only team other than Duke to be ranked No. 1 this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the opportunity of a lifetime,'' said UConn guard Richard
Hamilton. ``All season we've watched them (Duke) and wondered what
it would be like to play them. Now we get that chance.''
</P>
<P>
   A big part of playing Duke is not only overcoming its talent,
which is considerable, but also not being intimidated by its legacy
of success in this tournament. The Blue Devils are playing in their
eighth national championship game since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no fear factor in this game, said the Connecticut
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't fear anybody,'' said UConn guard Khalid El-Amin. ``We
have to guard them but they have to guard us, too. We've got some
things we can bring to the table. We feel we're very capable of
beating Duke.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most memorable games in the NCAA Tournament are
those where teams like N.C. State (1983 over Houston) and Villanova
(1985 over Georgetown) earned a place in history as giant-killers.
UConn would dearly love to join that list. The Huskies, however,
would not consider beating Duke an upset of historical proportions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are 33-2 so we've had a reasonably good season ourselves,''
said Calhoun, tounge in cheek. ``Duke's great but it all comes down
to 40 minutes of basketball_not what people think could or would or
should happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you want in life is an opportunity. And now we have it.''

 &HT;    Bobby Labonte shows he's a tough racer
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Bobby Labonte didn't understand what all the
fuss was about.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the press, race officials and the thundering
throng of 220,000 spectators at the Texas Motor Speedway were
astonished that the Corpus Christi native even drove in the
Primestar 500 Winston Cup race. This stocky, no-nonsense Texan
thought nothing of the fact that he also remained in his bright
lime-green Interstate Batteries Pontiac for all 334 laps,
challenged for the lead all day and finished third to his
victorious brother, Terry Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Bobby was concerned, he just went for a Sunday drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why'd you come to work today?'' he said, reversing a
reporter's question about his stamina. ``You wanted to, right? So
did I.''
</P>
<P>
   It needs to be pointed out that of the 43 drivers in this third
annual Texas event, Bobby Labonte was the only one who almost
literally had to be strapped in his car with a specially designed
brace. That's because he was also the only one who had broken his
right shoulder clavicle nine days earlier in a practice session at
Darlington Raceway in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the 34-year-old Labonte raced in that TranSouth 500
in Darlington as well, just two days after suffering the injury in
a practice session when he rammed into a wall. So you just knew
he'd be embarrassed to sit out a race in his home state after a
whole week of rest.
</P>
<P>
   To get credit for Winston Cup points, he had to start last
week's race before giving way to relief driver Matt Kenseth. But he
remained in the Joe Gibbs-owned car for 43 laps _ until the second
caution flag _because a pit stop when racing was first delayed
after lap four would have cost him a lap. Besides, Labonte wanted
to stick it out long enough to earn the five extra points for
leading a lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the toughest guy out here,'' said Butch Hylton, Labonte's
car chief. ``He has unbelievable grit and determination.''
</P>
<P>
   What else would you expect from a gung-ho character who loves
Mel Gibson movies and races a Primestar 500-record 144 mph in
vehicles that are real lethal weapons? How many folks could just
sit in traffic for 3 1/2 hours, drive 500 miles and tolerate the
kind of shooting pain Labonte felt, much less try to negotiate a
super-fast racetrack with a narrow straightaway and tough turns _
all with 42 buddies playing bumper cars behind you? How many people
could sway in a hammock that long?
</P>
<P>
   Labonte spent all week at the Carolina Panthers offices, getting
massage therapy from trainer Al Shuford, who fitted him with a
donut-shaped brace that the driver referred to as a ``big ol'
coconut shell.'' Crew chief Jimmy Makar readjusted Labonte's seat,
adjusted the support system on the right side of the car and gave
him some Alieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``All his life he's endured a lot of pain,'' Makar said. ``His
90 percent is as much as a lot of other guys' 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifty laps into Sunday's race, Labonte instructed his crew to
have Kenseth dressed and ready. But as his car held up and points
rival Jeff Gordon left the race after an early crash, the
adrenaline kicked in. Not even a sore neck the final 100 laps was
going to keep Labonte from finishing.
</P>
<P>
   He's accustomed to pain. Breaking a shoulder at Darlington
wasn't even virgin territory for Labonte; he cracked his other
shoulder blade in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs, the one-time Super Bowl-winning coach of the Washington
Redskins, did not minimize his driver's incredibly high pain
threshold.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, I appreciate it more because I know what it's
like,'' Gibbs said. ``Bobby fed off his brother, but it was a gutsy
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   With his third-place finish, Labonte picked up his fourth
top-five finish of the season; he trails Winston Cups points leader
Jeff Burton by only two points. Not surprisingly, only three
drivers had run every lap of the first two Texas events, and the
same three _ Sunday's runner-up Dale Jarrett and the Labontes _
completed all 334 circles again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good run for Bobby,'' brother Terry said admiringly.
``He's awful tough. I've done that before, too ... but not one week
after I broke it.''
</P>
<P>
   After post-race interviews, Bobby Labonte zipped to a nearby
private airport to fly home to Trinity, N.C., where he's lived
since his sophomore year in high school. As his spokesman, Jimmy
White, said, ``A good race-car is the best medicine. But he was
whooped.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Labonte was asked just what he planned to do for two
weeks, since NASCAR does not race on Easter, he sized up the
questioner with a straight face and a crooked shoulder and said,
``Probably go skiing or snowmobiling.''
</P>
<P>
   We think he was kidding.

 (ATTN EDS.: CORRECTS REFERENCE TO ORLANDO `EL DUQUE'
HERNANDEZ,  9th GRAF)  &HT;     By LESLIE GUTTMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
I am trying to walk like a Cubana: hips on ball bearings, swaying
beneath the straight, proud torso of a dancer. (ital) I am a queen.
I am in no rush. Check me out (unital).
<P>
   But it's no use. I can't get it, no matter how much I study the
women of Havana. Maybe if I stayed a year I'd learn, but I am only
here a couple of weeks, in a country that the United States has for
four decades considered the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   I am here to see the face of the enemy and what I am supposed to
fear.
</P>
<P>
   The face of the enemy is black, white, mulatto, an
Afro-Cuban-Spanish-European-Asian garden of wild beauty. The face
has a range of expressions, changeable as tropical weather, calm to
sunny to stormy. But the expression I see most, on the streets, in
stores, on bicycles, and while waiting for the giant pink and blue
semis-turned-buses called ``camellos'' (camels) is resignation. It
is a hardness, like a 10-centavo Cuban roll, from the frustration
of trying to survive in an economy that keeled over when the Soviet
Union did.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone hunts for U.S. dollars, the currency of the lucky ones,
whose hands touch the silken cloak of the tourist. An average
month's salary in Cuban pesos (less than $15) can barely buy three
weeks of food in a month, and stuff, good stuff _ Lycra bodysuits,
Rollerblades, Italian underwear _ can only be bought in dollars.
And Cuban youth want good stuff. That doesn't mean Payless shoes, a
top government economist tells me.
</P>
<P>
   A Cuban friend tells me the entire country could be bought for a
couple of million pairs of Levi's. I think the whole place is being
held together with duct tape and Krazy Glue, sent from a relative
in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   At the cemetery, a teenager is buried in a cardboard coffin.
Miguel, an esteemed union president I meet, wears a frayed woman's
gold nylon jacket salvaged from a donation box. In the graceful,
tree-lined neighborhood of Vedado, a crumbled pile of pink Italian
marble from another collapsed home lies underneath a ceiba tree. I
pick up a small piece shaped like a jagged heart to take home.
</P>
<P>
   I sit with my 19-year-old friend Carmen, a music student and
singer, on the Malecon, the sea wall on the edge of Havana. With
the crash of the waves to cover our conversation, she tells me that
if a jealous neighbor suspects she got her white and yellow Reeboks
through prostitution _ which she did not _ one phone call will send
her to jail. She tells me of three journalists jailed for
publishing a magazine protesting prison conditions for dissidents.
At 19, she has the face of someone who is scared she is a rose that
may never bloom.
</P>
<P>
   At the baseball game, record-breaking Orlando ``El Duque''
Hernandez has been obliterated from the stats book for bailing the
country for the United States and the Florida Marlins by boat.
Across Havana, a listlessness hangs in the air like a wet towel.
Everyone seems to be waiting for something that may never happen in
their lifetime. The price of a night out is too high for most
Cubans, who can only watch, from the sidewalk, tourists dancing in
clubs or listening to music or having nice dinners. The Cubans have
the faces of people who can still remember what good food tastes
like.
</P>
<P>
   On a dark, potholed lane in Central Havana, a man in a black
T-shirt and baseball cap pushes me and tries unsuccessfully to grab
my purse before running off. Later, in bed, I think about how he
didn't yank the strap very hard, almost as if the attempt was
half-hearted, tired. If there is to be a civil war when Fidel goes,
as some say, it cannot happen on Monday, Wednesday or Friday nights
at 9:30, when the weary country is transfixed by the lives of
Gaviota and Sebastian in the telenovela ``Cafe con Aroma de
Mujer.'' The empty streets echo with the choir of hundreds of TV
sets.
</P>
<P>
   I try and call home and find out service has been disconnected
between the United States and Cuba over delayed payments to the
Cuban telephone provider by American telephone companies. I get a
taste of what it is like to be cut off from the world. I understand
a little better why I am constantly quizzed about my life and the
United States: ``Are the hills in San Francisco really like they
look in the movies?'' ``How much money do you make?'' ``What is
Brooke Shields doing with her life?'' ``Can you tell me all the
words, in English, to Patsy Cline's `Crazy'?''
</P>
<P>
   Every tourist I meet on my journey says the same thing: ``We
wanted to come now, before things opened up, before you can get a
Happy Meal in Old Havana.'' Everyone wants to look into the crystal
ball to see what the marriage of Cuba and hard-core tourism will
bring.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of a flash rainstorm, my bus turns off the Malecon
to find a road that's not flooded. We lumber past a Cuban guy
trying to fix his battered beige car, a Russian Lada, stuck in the
heavy rain. As we pass, I see a tourist jump out of his shiny,
white rent-a-car a couple of feet in front of the broken-down Lada.
He runs in front of it and snaps a picture. Then he heads back to
his car and zooms off. It doesn't occur to him to help.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Che Guevara is ubiquitous, his movie-star face on posters,
murals, billboards and T-shirts. He is a hero, a keychain, a saint
in fatigues. I meet a noted surgeon, an older gentleman who lost
his private clinic and his wealth after the Revolution, but who
speaks of his life without regret or bitterness. We sit talking in
his garden under his treasured mango trees. He gives me a
three-peso coin with Che's face on it and tells me to save it.
``Every country needs a dreamer,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   I meet Cubans who want to stay in Cuba, and I meet Cubans
desperate to leave. The latter talk to me in low voices about
longing to own their futures. The believers in the Revolution move
me when they talk of fruits of its harvest: the near-perfect
literacy and infant mortality rates, the free education and health
care, a country where the old are never abandoned. And still others
tell me, frustrated over the U.S. embargo and the country's
internal economic policy: What good is free education if you can't
afford textbooks? Or health care with no medicine?
</P>
<P>
   But everyone is proud of the promise that no child go to bed
hungry and forgotten. In two weeks, I have never heard an infant
cry. I have never seen an unhappy child. They walk in laughing
packs of every age through the streets, strong, self-assured,
beloved. A 7-year-old girl can hitchhike home in the dark with no
fear.
</P>
<P>
   What is the most intriguing for me, coming from the United
States of Prozac, is that while the Cubans that I meet are unhappy,
frustrated, down about the economic disintegration of their
country, they still know how to laugh, have a good time, make an
instant friend from a stranger and a party out of bottle of rum and
a salsa tape.
</P>
<P>
   They don't have the microwaves, computers and VCRs Americans
have, but they also don't have the poverty of the spirit, the kind
that comes from waking up lonely in a studio apartment, or spending
a Christmas holiday with no family, or trying to keep up with the
Joneses, whom you've lived next door to for five years and have
never even met.
</P>
<P>
   Around midnight, a friend and I walk out of a concert hall to
find the musicians we had seen inside standing on a median in the
middle of a tree-lined street in Nuevo Vedado. They start playing,
and we start dancing, along with about 20 other people on the
cracked asphalt, into the warm night.
</P>
<P>
   On a breezy, late afternoon, a grandmother pulls me and another
gringa friend into her 19th-century home after seeing us admire,
through her half-open door, her collection of six-foot-tall dolls
dressed up like saints in glittering gold and blue. We spend the
afternoon talking about men, love and family, and looking at her
photo albums. We look at picture after picture of three
generations, aunts, uncles, sisters, brothers, sons, daughters. Not
one, that I can see, is the face of the enemy.

 &HT;    Cuba thrills to U.S. baseball
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ At 1:03 p.m. Cuba time Sunday, almost 50,000 Havana
baseball fans heard the strains of a song few of them had heard
before: The Star-Spangled Banner.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:08, after 11 innings, Baltimore Orioles first baseman Will
Clark made the final out. Behind him, high in the right field
grandstand, a huge sign encourages fans: Support The Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   But politics took a back seat to baseball Sunday. Clark made the
out, and the Orioles walked off the field 3-2 winners. Final stats:
Baltimore three runs, six hits, no errors; Cuba two runs, 10 hits,
no errors.
</P>
<P>
   No U.S. professional baseball team has played in Cuba since
March 1959, when Sandy Koufax pitched five innings for the Los
Angeles Dodgers against the Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   That was then, when Fidel Castro had recently brought his
revolution out of the hills and his rebels brought their guns to
the games, when Ernest Hemingway was still throwing down daiquiris
at La Floridita Restaurant in Old Havana and the roulette wheels
still spun and George Raft was starting to think maybe Cuba wasn't
the best place to invest his money.
</P>
<P>
   And now is now. George Hamilton, in Cuba on a humanitarian
visit, closed the bar at La Floridita Saturday night. Woody
Harrelson, here for the ``people-to-people'' exchange between Cuban
and U.S. artists and musicians, dined that night at La Bodeguita,
another Hemingway haunt. Jimmy Buffett has been singing around
Havana all week. U.S rock-and-rollers have been jamming with Cuban
bands for five days. Something is happening here, but they don't
know what it is.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, baseball was happening. The Cuban All Stars are players
in the 16-team Cuban National League, a state-run enterprise where
players are paid around $400 a year and discouraged from leaving
the country. The season is three months long, about 90 games per
team. If socialized baseball holds a benefit for Cuban fans, it's
the price of admission to the ballpark _ five cents in U.S. money.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans love baseball. Any level place is a potential playing
field. Dusty parks host pick-up games until night falls. Streets
are stickball emporiums, pretty safe for the kids because there are
not a lot of cars in Havana and many are up on blocks.
</P>
<P>
   They play finesse baseball in Cuba _ smaller players than in the
United States, small strike zones, precision base running, defense.
Defense is very important in Cuban baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban National Team third baseman, Luis Ulacia, has an arm like
a rocket launcher. In an earlier era, Washington would have wrapped
a blockade around the island until the Cubans did something about
Ulacia's arm.
</P>
<P>
   Foul balls hit into the stands are rare. Saturday, during five
innings of championship play between Santiago and the Industriales
of Havana, not a single foul ball left the playing field. Maybe the
batters pick their opportunities with care. Maybe, like all
commodities in Cuba, baseballs are precious. The Orioles fouled
more pitches into the stands by the third inning Sunday than the
Cuban teams had in the previous two games.
</P>
<P>
   But the ball that left the park and counted for something was
former Marlins catcher Charles Johnson's second inning home run, a
390-foot shot that landed 12 rows up in left-center field _ under
another sign extolling the virtues of the revolution. That put the
Orioles up 2-0, and although the Cubans would send the game into
extra innings, both teams as well as the crowd settled into a
pleasant afternoon, free of tension on and off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Castro was there, in his usual seat just behind home plate. He
doffed his military cap for the U.S. national anthem but didn't put
his hat over his heart as many of the visiting Americans did with
their Panama hats and baseball caps. As the teams were introduced,
Castro joined with the fans in clapping twice after each name _
only twice, always twice. Scott Erikson, clap-clap, Brady Anderson
clap-clap, the whole park applauding as one. No single player is
accorded more than his two claps.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Americans, including more than 100 members of the
media, took in the game. More than 100 schoolchildren from the
Baltimore area were there, baseball players all of them, in Cuba as
part of the ``people-to-people'' exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Their parents crowded the sole souvenir shop in the stadium,
where plastic chessmen, dominoes, sandals and game programs were
being sold by three old women from behind a frosted glass
partition. Baseballs sold out early. By the fifth inning the
shelves at the shop _ not well stocked to start with _ were as bare
as a Moscow butcher shop.
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson was there. ``I loved baseball as a kid,'' the actor
said. ``Today is a great day for the game. The weather, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   A visiting U.S. stage technician said it was all sort of like
ping-pong diplomacy in China during the early '70s. Then he thought
for a moment and said, ``But they got Tiananmen Square in 1989.''
</P>
<P>
   Cubans in attendance were there by invitation of the government
only. There were no nickel seats to be had. Col. Carlos Danil of
the Cuban Ministry of the Interior, sitting with other officials in
the third-base box seats, explained that some system had to be put
in place to assure order at the entrance gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``And please say this,'' the colonel asked. ``It has been 40
years, yes, since our peoples have played baseball together, but
our peoples have always been friends. We must be friends in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the colonel snapped to attention as the Cuban national
anthem was played, a marching song of the old socialist and now
mostly extinct sort that paid homage to tractors and plows.
</P>
<P>
   But the crowd was there for baseball, not music. Music they
would find after the game, when American and Cuban musicians
performed at the Karl Marx Theater. They cheered as their team took
the field. Castro raised a fist in salute.
</P>
<P>
   When Brady Anderson led off the game for the Orioles and lifted
the first pitch into shallow right field _ an easy out _ the fans
made the place shake. But C.J.'s home run quieted the partisans for
the rest of the day. When it was over, Castro congratulated his
players _ they are government workers after all _ and left the
park.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was not the only hero from South Florida. Murray Cook,
former manager at West Palm Beach's Municipal Stadium, was the man
who brought Havana's field up to major league standards. In 1996,
Cook started his own company, which manages the field at Roger Dean
Stadium. Major League Baseball asked him to ready the Havana grass
and infield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came down here last week, and all they had at the stadium
was a lawn mower and one infield rake,'' said Cook. ``No batting
practice cage, the outfield in rough shape. It looks good today.''
</P>
<P>
   The city of Havana does not look great. It's like the picture of
Dorian Gray, locked away in its Caribbean closet for 40 years,
untouched by developers, old but forever beautiful. But it's slowly
falling down. Streets are lined with rubble fallen from facades not
only untouched by developers for 40 years but untouched by
repairmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Havana looks like it did when I came here as a teenager in the
'50s,'' said George Hamilton. ``But then you look again, and it's
sad. The city needs help, the people. In time, maybe there will be
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   A pair of Cubans at the next table nod in agreement, but they
believe the walls have ears and won't comment on political changes.
It's not time yet, even if the Orioles and Jimmy Buffett are in
town.

TIRE WOES PUT A HOLE IN DAY FOR THREE TOP DRIVERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LEN HAYWARD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Mark Martin was the first driver to turn a
lap at Texas Motor Speedway. And those laps helped develop a
Goodyear tire for use in the Winston Cup series at the 1.5-mile
superspeedway.
</P>
<P>
   In yesterday's Primestar 500, however, Martin was one of the
drivers that had trouble with their tires during the race. In the
216th lap, Martin hit the wall in Turn 1 when he was running in the
top five. He said after the wreck that his right front tire went
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just one of those ol' racetracks that's mean on
tires,'' Martin said shortly after he climbed out of his wrecked
car. ``I've been involved with Goodyear on developing a tire,
testing the original tire for the original track. This place is
just a tough nut.''
</P>
<P>
   But Martin was not alone in his problems with the right front
tires. Both Jeff Gordon and Mike Skinner lost right front tires and
both hit the outside retaining wall, causing the point standings to
fluctuate and raising some concerns. Gordon crew chief Ray Evernham
said he thinks Gordon's tire had a cut, while Skinner's blew out.
</P>
<P>
   There was some talk in the garage area that some teams were
running as much as 4 pounds below Goodyear's recommended tire
pressure during the race.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin's crew chief, Jimmy Fennig, said that too much
camber, or wheel alignment, in the setup of the car is what caused
Martin's problem. Saturday's rain prevented the Cup cars from the
late Happy Hour practice to work on the setups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we had too much camber in the front of the car because
without Happy Hour we could not see how much camber we had,'' said
Fennig after Martin finished 32nd and fell to sixth place in the
point standings. ``We were wearing the inside of the tire out more.
We just got to do the job of setting the front end, so we don't
lose the tires.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Childress, Skinner's team owner, said they were
conservative with their air pressure and knew the 1.5-mile
superspeedway can wear out tires. Dale Earnhardt, who drives
Childress' other car, finished eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew this track is a little tough on tires, and we were
very careful of what we were doing,'' Childress said. ``We weren't
very aggressive at all. \RThe tire\S just blew, and Skinner went
straight into the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Holmer, Goodyear's marketing manager for stock-car racing,
said that, as the race progressed, things began to return to normal
for the tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams didn't have the critical Saturday-afternoon hour
practice due to rain,'' Holmer said in a statement. ``Teams were
going on the best information they had for race setups. After
engineers re-verified the minimum tire-pressure recommendations
with the teams during the race, the last half of the race went in a
normal fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's tire problem came 36 laps after NASCAR threw a
mandatory caution flag to have Goodyear engineers check tire wear.
The decision to have the mandatory stop was because Saturday's
Happy Hour was rained out.
</P>
<P>
   Holmer said the tires are being sent to the tire company's
technical center in Akron, Ohio, for testing.
</P>
<P>
   Most teams that finished the race did not have trouble with
their tires, but there was concern when three of the top-five
drivers in the point standings left the race because of right-front
tire trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were telling me they were OK, and they know not to tell
me that unless it's the truth,'' second-place finisher Dale Jarrett
said. ``We weren't as low on air pressure as some of those guys
were. We knew that created a problem for a few people anyway, so we
were giving up a little bit on the longer runs by not starting out
with air pressure as low in the right front tire. That's gonna
create a problem sooner or later if you continue to do that.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Allied warplanes braved bad weather Sunday night to
step up attacks on Yugoslav troops while NATO officials repeatedly
accused Serbian forces of large-scale atrocities in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain committed additional aircraft to
the allied force, and NATO's secretary-general, Javier Solana, said
its mission was shifting from neutralizing air defenses to stopping
``the humanitarian catastrophe which is taking place on the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in a brief statement before boarding a
helicopter for Camp David, said he supported the decision to hit a
broader range of targets, including ``forces in the field.'' He
said continuing Serb repression ``underscores the need for NATO to
persevere.'' When a reporter asked if the bombing was accelerating
the atrocities, he replied, ``Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   The shift in targeting, according to Pentagon spokesman Kenneth
Bacon, meant that attacks on military and police targets _ such as
barracks, headquarters and fuel and ammunition depots _ would now
account for more than one-third of all strikes, compared to about
one-fifth in earlier raids. While there may be occasional attacks
on tank columns or artillery, the basic plan is to cut off such
forces from their supply lines and communications, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a fifth straight night of bombing Sunday, NATO mounted
attacks that included cruise missile strikes by B-52 bombers.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the first allied plane loss of the war, an American
F-117 Stealth fighter whose pilot was rescued, Britain announced
that it would add four Harrier fighters to the eight already based
in Italy, and also assigned eight Tornado bombers and a Tristar
air-to-air refuelling tanker to the force. The United States
followed with an announcement that it was adding between six and 12
B-1 bombers and B-52 bombers.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO headquarters in Brussels, British Air Commodore David
Wilby said, ``I'm sure we will get a few more contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   In Yugoslavia itself, state television insisted repeatedly that
the Stealth plane was brought down, and several times aired footage
of the burning wreck. Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
defiantly praised his people and his armed forces for their defense
of Serbia, and staged a celebration in downtown Belgrade _ a rock
concert to show solidarity with the armed forces and to mark the
10th anniversary Sunday of his 1989 move to strip Kosovo of broad
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Air raid sirens wailed several times in Belgrade, and state-run
media gave some details of Saturday night attacks. But no new
casualty figures were announced. Yugoslav state media have
previously spoken of dozens killed in the NATO raids.
</P>
<P>
   On both sides of the Atlantic, officials were being asked what
they would do if air power failed to halt the violence against
Kosovo's Albanians. Clinton administration officials, as well as
those at NATO headquarters, insisted they had no intention of
committing ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Sandy Berger, the president's national security
adviser, was asked on the ABC News program ``This Week'' if he
could ``rule out the use of ground forces in the future?'' He
replied, ``We have no intention of doing that. I don't think it
would be advisable.''
</P>
<P>
   In London, Defense Minister George Robertson said NATO was
``disrupting the violence.'' He added, ``We have to make sure that
we keep doing it until the genocidal attacking stops.'' But when
asked about sending NATO troops in to stop the atrocities, he said,
``There are absolutely no plans for an opposed entry into Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has agreed to participate with NATO allies in
a Kosovo peacekeeping force should the Belgrade government relent
and join representatives of the Albanian majority in Kosovo in
signing a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Solana, also appearing in the ABC program, said the NATO allies
``are not in a position to deploy troops on the ground prior to a
settlement, to an agreement. This is a position all the countries
maintain until this moment. I don't know how things are going to
evolve, but at this point troops will not be deployed on the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   One strong voice from the Senate disagreed. ``We're in it and we
have to win it,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., appearing on
ABC's ``This Week.'' ``That means we have to exercise every
option.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that ``the American people have to know that these young
men and women that are piloting our airplanes are prepared to go
into harm's way to get the job done. And I would, all of us would,
grieve at the loss of a single American. But when you go into these
things, your primary purpose cannot be the safety of your forces,
it has to be the achievement of your strategic and tactical
goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchinson, R-Texas, appeared on CBS' ``Face the
Nation'' and suggested that ``troops on the ground'' from other
NATO countries might be the right response, because the United
States has taken the leading role in the air campaign. European
politicians express less fear of public reaction to military
casualties than Americans, accepting loss of life as a part of
fighting a war. But even so, they would demand U.S. participation
in any attacking force, as they have for peacekeeping missions in
Bosnia and Macedonia.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And the subject has been discussed, at least gingerly. One of
the ministers in German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's cabinet said
that the chancellor had told him before the air campaign began that
everyone had to be aware that bombing might not stop Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, and that an invasion by NATO troops
might have to be considered.
</P>
<P>
   Another option urged by Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn., and
Mitch McConnell, R-Ken., is for the United States to arm the Kosovo
Liberation Army to fight Milosevic's forces.
</P>
<P>
   Solana said, however, ``I don't think at this point, with a U.N.
resolution preventing the deployment of arms, I don't think it
would be a good idea to help in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the president left for Camp David, he met with national
security advisers. First he saw Berger alone, and then he spent an
hour with Berger, Defense Secretary William Cohen; George Tenet,
director of the CIA; Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff; Secretary of State Madeleine Albright; and Jim
Steinberg, a foreign policy adviser.
</P>
<P>
   They briefed the president on the details of Saturday night's
rescue operation and on the situation in Kosovo, and they reviewed
Sunday night's military plans. An aide said that they did not
discuss the possibility of sending in ground troops, but that the
president was increasingly concerned about the refugees fleeing
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Briefings on Saturday night's attacks were conducted Sunday both
in Brussels and London. In Brussels, Jamie Shea, a NATO spokesman,
said 66 aircraft flew in two waves, attacking 17 major targets.
Both he and Air Commodore Wilby focused their remarks less on
military matters than on what Shea called ``the deteriorating
humanitarian situation in and now around Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was particularly disturbing that hardly any men of
fighting age were among the refugees fleeing into Albania and
Macedonia. Shea asked, ``What has happened to the males between the
ages of 16 to 60?'' Wilby said, ``Villages are being systematically
emptied, looted and permanently destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   In London, Robertson made a similar case, beginning his briefing
by telling reporters: ``I am sorry to have to report that
Yugoslavia's campaign of repression against the Albanian population
is continuing. Seven towns on the Albanian border are reported to
be burning, and on the Macedonian border, as we have all seen on
television, Djakovica is in flames.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands of refugees are streaming across the border from
Kosovo into Albania and there are also reports that civilians may
be used as human shields to protect Milosevic's military machine,''
he said. ``If that is true, this would of course be a war crime in
its own right.''
</P>
<P>
   Vuk Draskovic, the Yugoslav deputy prime minister, denied
accusations that Serbia was committing genocide against ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo or that its security forces were carrying out
systematic ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, absolutely no,'' he said in an interview with CNN. ``We
need Albanians in our state. No one has that genocide strategy.''
He added, ``Albanians are doing that crime against us, I mean
Albanian terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   In his briefing the British defense minister also renewed his
warning to Serbian security forces that they were committing war
crimes and said, ``Every day we are watching what they are doing
and accumulating the evidence to bring them to book.'' He gave no
indication of how the evidence was being assembled.

   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky,
flew to Beijing on Sunday after U.S. negotiators told her they were
close to a deal under which Washington could support China's entry
into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barshefsky is expected to meet the Chinese prime minister,
Zhu Rongji, in Beijing on Tuesday. Next week, Zhu is to begin a
lengthy trip to the United States, and Washington is trying to make
a complex trade deal _ in which China would sweep away obstacles
that have long frustrated American businesses _ the centerpiece of
his visit. China has sought entry into the trade group for more
than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barshefsky said she did not expect to complete a deal during
her visit. But Washington is seeking concessions from China in a
wide range of areas, and she hopes to negotiate the most
politically sensitive problems directly with Zhu.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gen. Michael Edward Ryan, chief of staff of the
U.S. Air Force, is adamant that he is no ``wild-eyed advocate for
air power solving every military problem.'' He freely admits that
he does not know whether the current air war over Yugoslavia will
put an end to President Slobodan Milosevic's campaign of terror
against the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we can do it without ground troops,'' he said
in an interview Sunday in his sunlit Pentagon office.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Air Force commander in charge of the two-week-long
air campaign over Bosnia in 1995 that led to the Bosnia peace
accords in Dayton, Ohio, Ryan is certain of the value of an early
air campaign for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We waited for years in Bosnia, through years of atrocities,''
he said. ``I didn't think the nation could turn its back on the
atrocities in Kosovo now, particularly in the Balkans.''
</P>
<P>
   The general is the only Air Force chief of staff to have
followed in the his father's footsteps. Gen. John D. Ryan held the
same position from 1969 to 1973. ``This is my dad's old office,''
said the 58-year-old current occupant. ``I'm even living in his old
house.''
</P>
<P>
   The connection goes deeper. Michael Ryan graduated from the U.S.
Air Force Academy in 1965 with his older brother, John D. Ryan, Jr.
They went on to serve in the same squadron during the Vietnam War.
They broke the rules and flew their 100th combat mission together
over Vietnam. John even married a woman he met when she was the
maid-of-honor at Michael's wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1970, John died in a still unexplained air crash out of
Hamilton Air Base in California. ``He and I were really close,''
said Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   His rise in the ranks was also tied to his sense of
accountability. When the military plane carrying Commerce Secretary
Ron Brown crashed in Croatia in 1996, Ryan reprimanded 16 Air Force
officers, including two generals, ending the careers of several of
them. One year later, the Air Force chief of staff quit in protest
after Secretary of Defense William Cohen disciplined an Air Force
general over the terrorist attack of a U.S. military barracks in
Saudi Arabia. Ryan was appointed to the job.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he is drawing on lessons from Vietnam or
Bosnia in the current air campaign, Ryan quickly points out that in
today's military it is the theater commander for the region _ in
this case Gen. Wesley Clark _ who calls the shots. ``What we do is
organize, train and equip the personnel and advise,'' said Ryan.
``Then the operations are run out of the theater, and what we do
here is a lot of pacing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When he was commander of NATO's allied air forces in southern
Europe, Ryan was there, shaping the air war against the Bosnian
Serbs. That air war was a success in part, he said, because the
NATO air force was working with ground troops _ the armies of the
Bosnian Muslims and the Croatians.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the major difference between that campaign and today,''
he said. ``There was a real threat on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Today there are no ground forces in Kosovo to take advantage of
the air campaign. The Kosovo Liberation Army, the ethnic Albanian
rebel group there, is barely an army, Ryan said, and ``essentially
can't go up against'' Yugoslavia's professional, disciplined force,
which has sufficient tanks and weaponry to destroy the fledgling
Albanian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. George Joulwan, the former supreme allied commander in
Europe, said he actively lobbied the administration to promote Ryan
to chief of staff because he had worked within NATO and become
accustomed to ``having to keep the alliance together.``
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can appreciate what a challenge it is to work with all
of those countries, to mount an intense bombing campaign and still
limit any damage beyond military targets,'' said Joulwan. ``Mike
did a super job of it.``
</P>
<P>
   Ryan was also the commander who oversaw the rescue of Scott
O'Grady, the Air Force captain whose F-16 was shot down over Bosnia
in 1995. That led to improvements by Ryan in the search-and-rescue
units that were used on Saturday to save a downed American pilot
who crashed in Yugoslavia. ``This last operation was done very,
very well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan is also credited with improving intelligence gathering for
pilots before they take off on their combat missions, said Kenneth
Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the poster boy under Secretary William Perry for
improving the use of intelligence for war fighters,'' Bacon said.
``He set up intelligence centers where he brought together
everything we collect and then got it very quickly to the people
briefing the pilot just before the mission, updating the pilot in
the cockpit when necessary.``
</P>
<P>
   When asked where he was born, Ryan said, ``I'm from Air Force.''
He translated that, saying he was raised all over the country but
born in San Antonio, Texas, on Dec. 24, 1941. He and his wife,
Jane, are the parents of four grown children, two daughters and two
sons, none of whom has chosen a professional military career.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to prepare public sentiment in Europe and the United
States for uncertainties of the current air war is never far from
Ryan's thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to be an easy operation, and it was a hard
choice for the administration,'' he said. ``Air power is what we
tried last in the Bosnian War but this time our NATO allies agreed
to try it first.``
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, among others, he abhors any attempts to assess
the Kosovo campaign. ``You can't be instantly gratified with only
five days of bombing,'' he said. ``It's got to take some time to
sink in.''

AVERY WOULDN'T HEAR NO, EVEN FROM DUKE'S COACH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ When William Avery was a junior in high
school, Mike Krzyzewski told him the truth: No matter how wondrous
his basketball talent, he did not have the grades to get into Duke.
The young man walked out of the coach's office and told his mother,
Terry, that he had found the school for him.
</P>
<P>
   For his senior year, he transferred to a Virginia prep school,
Oak Hill Academy, and devoted more attention to developing
classroom acumen than a crisper crossover dribble. ``It was either
go to junior college and play basketball or learn to learn and go
to Duke,'' he said, matter of fact.
</P>
<P>
   When he got to Durham as a freshman last season, Avery backslid
briefly and ran afoul of Krzyzewski's academic requirements, and
the coach left him home for the Blue Devils' opener at Army. Avery
got right with the academic program immediately and played the next
35 games in a 32-4 season.
</P>
<P>
   He never started, though he averaged 8.5 points, 2.5 assists and
19 minutes a game as a backup to a Krzyzewski favorite, Steve
Wojciechowski. So began the education of the latest in a long line
of classic hard-nosed, intelligent Duke point guards.
</P>
<P>
   And on Monday night, when the Blue Devils (37-1) face
Connecticut (33-2) in the National Collegiate Athletic Association
championship game, between the only two teams to hold the nation's
No. 1 ranking this season, Avery will be the most vital player for
either team on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski believes the Blue Devils are in good hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all our players who have had big years, William has had the
most important one,'' he said. ``He's a better player than he was a
month ago. He's getting better every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Avery and Chris Carrawell have started every game for the
Blue Devils. Avery earned this distinction by responding the same
way he did after that first meeting with Krzyzewski. Avery blew up
old habits and replaced them with new, better ones and in doing so
became the undisputed floor leader of the team that has won 32
straight games.
</P>
<P>
   He is responsible for getting his friend and roommate Elton
Brand the ball down low, for hitting Trajan Langdon on the wing
after he pops from behind a pick, for triggering the Blue Devils'
man-to-man pressure as soon as the opposing guard crosses the
halfcourt line.
</P>
<P>
   He is responsible for everything but what he did best as a high
school standout in Augusta, Ga.: scoring points. That is why Brand,
a fellow sophomore, calls Avery the best student he has come across
in his short college career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing has been easy for him,'' Brand said. ``He's had to
start over at everything. Last year, he'd come into the game and
look to score points. Now he knows that's not what we need from
him. It's been really something to watch him grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Avery has abandoned putting the ball in the basket. He
is the Blue Devils' third-leading scorer, averaging 15 points a
game with a 49.2 percent field goal average. He is also a deadly
3-point shooter, as Michigan State learned in the semifinals when
he sank a 23-footer to stretch the Blue Devils' lead to 57-50 in
the closing minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But it is his team-leading 5.3 assists a game and quick hands on
defense that Duke will rely on against UConn. Krzyzewski calls the
Huskies the best offensive transition team in the country.
``William needs to be ready to cover all their perimeter players,''
said Krzyzewski, checking off Richard Hamilton, Khalid El-Amin and
Ricky Moore.
</P>
<P>
   When Avery squares up with Moore, a new chapter of a shared
history will play out. The two were teammates and state champions
at Westside High School in Augusta. Then Moore was a senior and
prolific scorer; now he is one of the most feared defenders in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   In high school Avery was a budding shooter. Now he is an
important stopper on one of the best defensive teams in the nation.
In the course of this transformation, he has built himself into a
first-round National Basketball Association prospect, perhaps as
early as this spring. It is something he has thought about ever
since having the word ``Truth'' tattooed on his left biceps.
</P>
<P>
   But for now only the Huskies hold his attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I'm interested in right now is running my team,'' he said.
``I'm important to what is going to happen. We've come a long way,
and now it's time to finish what we started. I need to make that
happen.''

JUST HOW PRINCELY IS DUKE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Let's say Duke wins tonight. Let's say
Duke wins big, 15 or 20 points, maybe 25. Will the Blue Devils
merit consideration as one of the greatest teams in NCAA history?
Or are they merely the best of a depleted field? They wouldn't have
beaten North Carolina three times by 55 points if Antawn Jamison
and Vince Carter had stayed in school.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, Duke's credentials are worthy of the best ever. The
Blue Devils have seven McDonald's high school All-Americans, every
starter will be a lottery pick _ yes, even unheralded small forward
Chris Carrawell _ and a win tonight gives them 38 this season, an
NCAA record.
</P>
<P>
   They became the first team in Atlantic Coast Conference history
to go 16-0 and the first to have every starter named all-league.
(The ACC selects three five-man teams.)
</P>
<P>
   Their average scoring margin (25.4 points) is No. 8 in NCAA
history, less than a point behind UCLA's 1967 and 1968 teams.
</P>
<P>
   They have made 67 more free throws than their opponents have
attempted, which means they're brutally hard to guard, and
opponents have 217 more turnovers than assists, which means they
play hellacious defense.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, Duke is one of the most dominant teams ever. But
it's case for being one of the best seems thin.
</P>
<P>
   The cross-examination begins at home: This probably isn't coach
Mike Krzyzewski's best team. The 1986 gang won 37 before losing to
Louisville in the championship game, and the 1992 version, with
Christian Laettner, Bobby Hurley and Grant Hill, was one for the
ages _ the first post-Wooden team to win back-to-back titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the '92 team was probably better than both '86 and
'99,'' said ESPN analyst Jay Bilas, Duke's starting center in 1986.
``Neither of those teams had anyone as versatile and clutch as
Laettner, who's probably the best player Duke has ever produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``And one thing that's unique this year is the ACC's down. If
this team played the '92 schedule or the '86 schedule, it wouldn't
be 37-1.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils may not be the best team of the past three
years. Kentucky '96 was awesome. Its average victory margin in six
NCAA games was 21.5 _ Duke's is 25.4 through five games _ and it
had six first-round picks: Derek Anderson, Antoine Walker, Tony
Delk, Nazr Mohammed, Walter McCarthy and Ron Mercer.
</P>
<P>
   Match the Blue Devils against the best teams of all time (San
Francisco '56, UCLA '68, '69 and '72, and Indiana '76), and they
fall short on two counts. With a freshman, three sophomores, one
junior and one senior in the top rotation, they lack the experience
to compete with the greatest. And while 6-foot-8 sophomore Elton
Brand is the best big man in the nation today, he couldn't possibly
compete with Bill Russell, Lew Alcindor and Bill Walton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being from L.A. (Rolling Hills), I'm sensitive to the
comparisons with the Wooden teams,'' Bilas said. ``People say the
road was easier back then because you only played four tournament
games instead of six, but I doubt Alcindor and Walton would have
had much trouble with a No. 16 seed. UCLA pounded teams. Alcindor
was the greatest scorer of all time. I don't buy the comparison for
one second.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's straight from the mouth of a Dookie.
</P>
<P>
   It's official: Of the 13 Pac-10 referees who worked the first
weekend of the tournament, only four were deemed worthy of
advancing to the regional round: Bill Kennedy, Don McAlister,
Charlie Range and Dave Libbey, who called the Duke-Michigan State
game Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   (That's right UCLA fans, no Terry Christman.)
</P>
<P>
   If the Pac-10 wants better officials, it should find a better
coordinator of officials. Two of the best refs, Tom Harrington and
Mark Reischling, no longer work the league because of differences
with boss Booker Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: A name to consider as Pepperdine searches to
replace departed coach Lorenzo Romar: Santa Barbara's Bob Williams,
a former Pepperdine assistant who is well-respected in coaching
circles and did a great job this year with the Gauchos. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Former St. John's coach Fran Fraschilla may find his new gig at
New Mexico tougher than it looks. The lofty expectations aren't
commensurate with the in-state talent, and Albuquerque's a long way
from L.A. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Stanford will have a new offense next season in response to
better athletes and opponent scouting. Coach Mike Montgomery says
teams have figured out his system. I can think of one that hasn't.
. . .
</P>
<P>
   I had a dream Sunday night that San Diego State hired Steve
Fisher, the former Michigan coach. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Tonight probably is Brand's last game at Duke. A 6-foot-8,
260-pounder, Brand will be a top-five pick in the NBA draft with
Rhode Island's Lamar Odom, Maryland's Steve Francis, Miami-Ohio's
Wally Szczerbiak and UCLA's Baron Davis. Is this Duke sophomore
point guard William Avery's last game, as well? . . .
</P>
<P>
   In this space Saturday, I identified Brad Millard, St. Mary's
7-foot-3, 340-pound center, as Russ Millard, who played for Iowa
several years ago. Is delirium a defense for stupidity? . . .
</P>
<P>
   In case you missed it, Glendora native (and Stanford recruit)
Casey Jacobsen scored 23 points in the McDonald's All-American game
Wednesday. Odds are, he'll match that total a few times in Maples
Pavilion. . . .
</P>
<P>
   And finally: Looking for a player to watch tonight? Try Duke
freshman Corey Maggette, a prodigious talent who will thrive in the
speedy tempo just as Toby Bailey excelled for UCLA in 1995. &QL;

   HOLLOMAN AIR FORCE BASE, N.M. _ Half a world away from the site
in Yugoslavia where an American F-117 stealth bomber crashed, the
flier's home base commander defended the warplane Sunday as a
``premier weapon system,'' and vowed to send ``a couple dozen
more,'' if asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not invulnerable, they are not invisible, they are
`low observable,''' the commander, Brig. Gen. William Lake, said at
a news conference held here against the backdrop of a desert mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Rain was not a factor in the crash, said the commander of a base
where pilots are accustomed to flying the cloudless blue skies of
southern New Mexico. Asked if the kind of older radar used by
Yugoslavia might have picked up the plane, he declined to answer.
Although he described the jet as a top-secret plane, he said that
NATO bombers have not returned to the site to destroy the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot received only minor cuts in the ejection, Lake said,
adding that on Saturday he gave the bad news first, then the good
news, to the pilot's wife here. He said he expected that the pilot,
whose name has not been released, would soon return to flying.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, the base commander was the pivotal figure in
a drama that revealed how this small corner of America is
intimately tied to the war in faraway Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   As about 75 officers and their spouses gathered for a farewell
dinner at the Officers Club, the traditional bantering atmosphere
had been replaced by tension, from watching Yugoslavian
television's images of the burning wreckage of the Holloman jet. At
the start of the dinner, Lake rose and briefed the somber gathering
with the latest Pentagon information.
</P>
<P>
   Half an hour later he stood up and said, ``We got him, it's
over, he's in good health, and on his way back'' to Aviano Air
Force base in Italy, Col. Eckhard Sowada, who commands a German air
force training unit here, recalled Sunday. ``Everybody in the hall
broke out in a cheer when he said that the pilot was successfully
taken out of Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is relieved he was saved, we are just just happy
that he was OK,'' said the wife of one stealth fighter pilot who
has not been sent on this mission. ``It's a small stealth
community; we all know everybody. It would have hit everybody
pretty hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Several stealth pilots did not return telephone calls. But one
flyer in another group said of the loss of the war plane, ``No
matter what anybody says, when you lose an airplane, it gives you
pause.''
</P>
<P>
   Off the base, in this small city of 31,000 people, relief was
tempered by disappointment that a $43-million aircraft, marketed to
the public as a ``stealth'' would be the first NATO plane to crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of mind-boggling to have such modern technology and
to have something like this happen,'' said Rick Covarrubia, a
special education teacher. ``I feel disappointment in the aircraft
being such a wreck, the news showing it like it was made of
paper.''
</P>
<P>
   At a welding shop, Larry Berry, an Army veteran from Vietnam,
noted that this was the first stealth plane to go down in combat,
and said, ``So far they had been real lucky, kind of invincible.
It's a reality check when one gets blown out of the sky.''

HOOP HEAVEN IS CROWDED, AND THE VIEW IS DIZZYING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Duke has been in this position before,
sailing through March and landing safely on a Monday night with the
chance to be crowned the premier squad in college basketball.
Connecticut will walk into foreign territory, tiptoeing a bit as it
tries to defeat a team many experts consider impenetrable.
</P>
<P>
   Only 40 minutes of basketball are left before one of those teams
finishes a six-month blitz through a hectic season as the best;
before Duke completes the decade with its third national
championship or UConn snares its first; before the climax of
another magnificent hoops display. It used to be strictly about
basketball. But now the Final Four is basketball immersed in four
days of hype, hoopla and hysteria. It is a spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the Super Bowl now,'' said John Wooden, the
88-year-old former UCLA coach, who won 10 national championships in
12 years in calmer conditions.
</P>
<P>
   When Wooden won his last championship in 1975, 15,151 people
turned out to see UCLA's victory over Kentucky. A crowd of 41,430
crammed into Tropicana Field here on Saturday to watch the
semifinal games of the men's Final Four, and at least as many will
attend the championship game on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Some upper-level seats are so far from the court that tickets
should come with binoculars and miniature televisions. Still, the
fans flock to the games and even the practices. A throng of 27,662
watched four perfunctory workouts on Friday. Layup lines have never
been so fervently applauded.
</P>
<P>
   Why do they come? They are lured by a passion for basketball,
and for what they see as the purity of the college game, which
culminates in 19 maddening days in March.
</P>
<P>
   It is really the only time of the year when college basketball
dominates the sports world, no matter what fans in North Carolina
or Indiana think. Select the 64 best teams, toss them into a
tournament, and wonderful stories always evolve as the group is
whittled to one. All the National Collegiate Athletic Association
has to do is oversee the action, constantly refer to the players as
student-athletes, grin once a minute and listen to the cash
registers hum.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you love hoops, you come to these games,'' said Rich
Blaser, who traveled here from Manassas, Va., for his eighth Final
Four and who might have had a better view if he had stayed home.
``This is heaven for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It is lucrative for the often-beleaguered NCAA, which has an
eight-year, $1.725 billion contract with CBS for the rights to
televise the tournament through 2002. The $226 million the NCAA
will receive from CBS this year represents about 80 percent of its
total revenue for the 1998-99 fiscal year. The NCAA will gross
another $18.2 million from ticket sales for the tournament, $3.7
million of that at the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite these tidy totals, and despite what Duke coach
Mike Krzyzewski called a ``kind of neat'' championship game, which
will match the only two schools to hold the No. 1 ranking this
season, the tournament cannot erase lingering problems.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA has agreed to pay damages of $54.5 million to about
2,000 assistant coaches whose earnings were restricted. It has seen
its Proposition 16, which set minimum test scores for athletic
eligibility, ruled discriminatory. It is also being sued by an
athletic apparel company and two manufacturers of aluminum bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``As trying as these times are, I don't feel the NCAA is under
siege,'' said Cedric Dempsey, the association's president. ``The
NCAA is in the midst of change, and I see those changes as being
very positive.''
</P>
<P>
   The men's basketball title game has certainly changed
immeasurably since Oregon defeated Ohio State, 46-33, before 5,500
fans in Evanston, Ill., in 1939. The NCAA lost $2,531 on that game.
It was the last time the NCAA lost money on a men's championship
game.
</P>
<P>
   Now the spectacle, and the income from it, is gigantic. CBS
charges $700,000 for a 30-second commercial, and more than 1,000
news-media credentials were issued for the Final Four. But is
bigger necessarily better? Wooden, still spry as he sat 10 rows
from the court on Saturday, was not certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think television has been bad for collegiate basketball,''
he said. ``I think it's made showmen out of players, coaches and
officials, to a certain degree. But I never want that statement to
be used unless I also add that it's been the savior of
non-income-producing sports and women's sports. So there's two
sides to everything.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   Magic Johnson and Larry Bird helped elevate the championship
game to another level in 1979. Forget Michigan State and Indiana
State. It was Magic against Larry. The smooth point guard with all
the fancy moves and the electric smile against the savvy forward
with the sharp jumper and the vacuous expression.
</P>
<P>
   There was something magnetic about the two best players in the
country, one black and one white, meeting in the title game,
something that made even nonfans gravitate toward the game. With
Johnson scoring 24 points and Bird struggling to a 7-for-21 effort
from the field, Michigan State prevailed, 75-64.
</P>
<P>
   The game in Salt Lake City attracted 18 million television
viewers and the rating of 24.1 remains the highest for a
championship contest; last year's game between Kentucky and Utah
drew a 17.8 rating.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to know why more than 40,000 fans will be at
Tropicana Field on Monday night, why one scalper was trying to
purchase a pair of courtside tickets for $3,500 to resell them for
$5,000, and why millions will watch on television, think Magic and
Larry.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say it started the explosion of college basketball,''
said Johnson, who watched Michigan State lose to Duke on Saturday
night. ``I think that it pushed college basketball to another
level. We know it changed things. It's still the highest-rated
game. That's the proof in the pudding.''
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected, Bird, who buried his face in a towel to
hide his tears after the defeat, was not as willing to dribble down
memory lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magic's been promoting that because he won the game,'' Bird
said. ``If I had won the game, you would've never heard of it. So
I'm sick of it. I'm ready to move on with my life. It was 20 years
ago. I can't remember that far back.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the tournament has become such a money maker, do not
expect to see the Final Four held in anything but a dome. The
selection committee has picked the sites through 2007, and they are
all domes with a minimum seating capacity of 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is this game being played in a dome?'' Wooden asked on
Saturday. ``There's only one reason they're playing it here. It's
not so more people can fit. It's so more people can pay. That's the
reason. But money rules everything.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Final Four, it surely does. It was difficult to walk
around Tropicana Field without someone muttering, ``You selling
tickets?'' Even some coaches who met here for the National
Association of Basketball Coaches meeting sold their tickets, which
is a violation of NCAA rules and also against the law in Florida.
One assistant coach, who insisted on anonymity, said he scalped two
tickets for $1,250 because it was more than he earned in a week.
</P>
<P>
   High above the court, Blaser, the fan from Virginia, leaned
against a wall between Sections 313 and 315 and watched basketball.
Or tried to. It was impossible to see almost half of the court,
because a monstrous catwalk obstructed his view.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Blaser, who paid $80 for tickets as one of 11,278 fans
who were fortunate enough to secure them through a lottery, was
content. But John Brzezinski of Chicago, who paid a broker $475 for
tickets, was perturbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm angry,'' he said. ``We knew we would be up high, but they
didn't say anything about this catwalk. You think twice about
coming again.''
</P>
<P>
   Brzezinski could vent, but there would always be someone else to
scoop up the ticket. Sandra Harrington of Columbia, S.C., called
her seat cruddy _ according to figures in a press guide, it was
about 230 feet from midcourt and 225 feet above the floor _ but
then added: ``I'd rather be here than in a sports bar. You're in
the dome. You're in the atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   That atmosphere extended to something called Hoop City, at the
Tampa Convention Center, where fans could participate in basketball
drills, meet coaches and players and visit interactive exhibits.
Alicia Brown, 19, of Riverside, Calif., even won $1 million by
draining a 3-pointer there on Saturday. For those who could not get
tickets to the Final Four, there was a high school all-star game
and college slam-dunk and 3-point-shooting contests.
</P>
<P>
   So the season is down to one game. Shane Battier of Duke
admitted that the rims ``get tighter'' now, while his teammate
Trajan Langdon said he had dreamed about Monday night since he was
a kid in Alaska. E.J. Harrison, a reserve guard for UConn who made
the team as a walk-on, spoke like someone who did not want this
experience to end. He was not alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dream,'' Harrison said. ``It's the Final Four, the
national championship. Everybody wants to play in this. Everybody
wants to see this.''

U.S. WOMEN SHUT OUT MEXICO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ It took an entire match to wear down Mexican
goalkeeper Linnea Quinones, and by the time the United States was
finished with the former San Diego State standout, she was all
smiles despite the Americans' 3-0 victory at the Rose Bowl on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Foudy scored in the 38th minute to give the U.S. a 1-0
lead and Kristine Lilly scored two late goals to ice the victory in
a World Cup tune-up at the site of this summer's Women's World Cup
final on July 10.
</P>
<P>
   Quinones, one of eight Californians on Mexico's roster, turned
away several U.S. shots, and at one time smothered America's
favorite striker, Mia Hamm, on a breakaway.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a moral victory for the Mexicans. In three
matches against the U.S. previously, Mexico was beaten 9-0, 12-0
and 9-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone showed a lot of confidence today and a lot of
confidence in me,'' said Quinones, who faced 20 shots on goal. ``Of
course the U.S. is one of the top teams in the world. We knew it
would be a tough match, but everyone on this team really came
together and was out for one thing. We wanted to show that we
deserve to be in this World Cup and in the class of the elite teams
in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinones talked about her encounter with Hamm, sounding more
like an admiring fan than Mexico's captain in the nets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw her coming, thinking `this is Mia Hamm right in front of
you,' but I concentrated on the ball and didn't look up,'' she
said. ``I was lucky to get it so when I got up I had all these
feelings. It was pretty emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a huge edge in shots (42-1) and a thoroughly controlled
midfield, the U.S. led only 1-0 before Lilly's goals in the 85th
and 88th minutes. U.S. coach Tony DiCicco expected the Mexicans to
pack it in defensively and felt comfortable with the result.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an excellent defensive effort by Mexico, they've come a
long way since we played them in September,'' DiCicco said. ``They
played with a lot of heart, but I was pleased with our team because
we kept attacking. At times we were left a little naked in the
back, but we worked hard to get behind the ball and we defended
well. The final result was a just result because the goals came
late.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm, who came into the match with 103 career goals, needed only
three more to match the international world scoring record held by
Italy's Elisabetta Vignotto. She failed to score for the fifth
consecutive game, however, and joked with a reporter who suggested
she was struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're obviously not my sports psychologist,'' she said with a
smile.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm explained that the U.S. team's layoff in the fall may have
affected her ability to return to normal form.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to come to grips with your psychological dimension
and tell yourself it's going to take some time,'' Hamm said.
``That's where I am right now. I really have to concentrate on the
things I'm doing well. I'm hard enough on myself, and sure I would
have loved to score today, but it wasn't necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I keep contributing to help this team win, that's
all I care about. Goals have never defined me as a player and I
don't think it ever will. What defines me is my impact on this team
even if it means sitting there (on the bench) with pom-poms.''

GORDON STRIKES OUT FOR THE THIRD TIME AT TMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Jeff Gordon's third stab at the Texas Motor
Speedway ended with a familiar message: Don't Mess With Texas.
</P>
<P>
   For the third consecutive year, Gordon failed to finish the
NASCAR Winston Cup race at Texas Motor Speedway. The three-time and
defending Cup champion ran up front until the right front tire on
his No. 24 DuPont Automotive Finishes Chevrolet went down and sent
Gordon hard into the Turn 4 wall after 68 laps during yesterday's
Primestar 500.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who had been in early contention, was rushed to the
infield care unit, where X-rays revealed no broken bones. Bruised
and frustrated, Gordon's team exited TMS long before Hendrick
Motorsports teammate Terry Labonte crossed the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty much the hardest I've ever hit a wall, that's for
sure. I hit \Rit\S a ton,'' said Gordon, who suffered his second
Did Not Finish in six races, matching his total DNFs for all of
last season. ``I'm not exactly sure what happened. Somehow the
right front tire went down, but we're not exactly sure why, yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew chief Ray Evernham said the tire did not blow out. ``It
just went on the liner and didn't turn, so that tells me it's
possibly a cut. I wanted to see the tire, but it's so hard when the
tire is that destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's Coca-Cola 300 winner, Mark Martin, and Mike Skinner
both crashed yesterday from similarly blown or cut right front
tires. Skinner suffered a hairline fracture of the right shoulder
blade. Martin re-entered the race and completed 253 of the 334 laps
to finish 34th.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said he will be ready to run in the next Winston Cup
race, the Food City 500 in Bristol, Tenn., on April 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first time I've ever seen him wreck that hard,''
Evernham said. ``If he said he'd be ready for Bristol we'll get him
ready somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   His wreck yesterday continued a run of tough luck in North
Texas. The wreck, which made Gordon the race's first casualty, was
his fourth crash in as many races at TMS, but the first that didn't
result from a crash already in progress in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon got caught up in his third consecutive TMS crash Saturday
during the Coca-Cola 300, a Busch Grand National race he said he
wanted to run to get more lap time and become better acquainted
with TMS' 1.5-mile quadoval. He finished 13th, making it the only
TMS race he has completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was running pretty good \Ryesterday\S, but it looked like
his car was pushing a little,'' said Dale Jarrett, who trailed
Gordon at the time of the crash. ``It surprised me when I saw him
hit the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon placed 43rd for the first time in his career and finished
last for only the second time, the first coming on March 9, 1997,
at the Atlanta Motor Speedway when he finished 42nd.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, whose finished earned $60,000 yesterday, fell from
second to fourth in the Winston Cup points standings with 790, 119
points behind leader Jeff Burton, who finished seventh yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next couple of days I'll be pretty stiff,'' Gordon said,
``but I believe I'll be all right and we'll be ready to go.''

   HAVANA _ It was a sunny event laced with nationalism and
patriotic feeling, but in the end, the game played here Sunday
between the Baltimore Orioles and the Cuban national team was about
baseball, and the 50,000 Cubans who attended walked out with their
heads high.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a magnificent game,'' Sergio Girat, a 34-year-old
hospital worker, said after the 11-inning battle, which was won by
the Orioles, 3-2. ``Our team played up to their level. They got
what they wanted to achieve, and they lost, but they went down
fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   All over Havana, people from the upper echelons of the
government to taxi drivers and bartenders were talking about the
game Sunday night, analyzing the mistakes made and opportunities
lost.
</P>
<P>
   But if they felt defeated, nearly everyone was also proud. The
Cuban team, minus several stars who are busy with the Cuban League
playoffs here, came close to beating the professionals from
Baltimore, losing by just one run and managing to get 10 hits off
the American pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   The game marked the first time a major league team had visited
Cuba since the Cincinnati Reds and Los Angeles Dodgers played an
exhibition here in March 1959.
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of many Cuban fans, the game seemed to demonstrate
once and for all that they have professional-caliber players, a
sore point with many people who have been cut off from the major
leagues for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have shown them that Cuban baseball is as good as the
baseball in the big leagues,'' Jose Fernandez, an electric company
worker, said, echoing the views of many others.
</P>
<P>
   The game ended weeks of speculation and anticipation among
Cuba's baseball fans. Baseball is deeply entwined with Cuban
culture and history, and a passion for the game has persisted
despite the long ideological war between Cuba and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans began playing baseball more than 120 years ago, and
nationalist leaders during Cuba's wars for independence against
Spain extolled baseball above other sports, linking the game in the
nation's consciousness with the birth of modern Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Before Fidel Castro seized power in 1958, professional and
semiprofessional baseball thrived in Cuba, producing major league
ballplayers like Minnie Minoso, Camilo Pascual and Tony Oliva.
</P>
<P>
   But Castro abolished professional sports in 1961 and established
a Soviet-style athletic program. Since then, Cuban baseball teams
have dominated amateur competitions like the Olympics and Pan
American Games but have been denied the chance to test their skills
against the best players in the world, much to the dismay of fans.
</P>
<P>
   That ended Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   People who had tickets for the game began arriving at the
Estadio Latinoamericano at 7 a.m., threading their way through a
heavy security cordon which included dozens of plain-clothed police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   By 11:30, when the Cuban team in its blue and red uniforms began
taking batting practice, the faded one-tier stadium was packed to
the rafters. The Cuban players were tense as they waited for their
turns in the batting cage.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Linares, the 31-year-old third baseman who is considered
the best all-around player in Cuba, told reporters that he had no
regrets about having stayed in Cuba rather than defecting to the
United States, where he undoubtedly could have had a major league
career. ``None, absolutely none,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the other Cuban players were less polite, expressing
frustration with several members of the Cuban national team who
have defected since 1991 to seek careers in the United States.
Several players said they were committed communists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a hundred-percent revolutionary,'' said Oscar Machado, an
outfielder. ``I would not have done what they have done.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Orioles began their batting practice, the crowd
had begun to size up the opposition. The Americans looked big
compared to the Cuban team, several fans said. When the Orioles'
bellicose outfielder, Albert Belle, hammered four balls out of the
stadium in a row, thousands went ``ooh'' and ``aah.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the invitation-only crowd was relatively quiet compared
with the raucous fans who usually attend games here. Cuban fans are
known for playing drums and brass to conga beats to rally their
teams, screaming insults at umpires and sipping rum, a practice
that leads to arrests for disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the orderly crowd was the government's decision
to keep a tight control over who could attend. Tickets were
distributed to Communist Party faithful through schools, youth
organizations and unions, officials said. Some were also parceled
out to workers and civil servants as rewards for meeting production
quotas and other state goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people here were all invited,'' said Leonardo Marquez, a
30-year-old electrician who was given his ticket as a reward for
being productive. ``It's for the protection of the foreigners here.
We were all told to behave ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Some fans outside the stadium, however, were bitter, not unlike
followers of major league teams in the United States who find
themselves without a ticket during the World Series because so many
seats have been snapped up by dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Roman Garcia, a 47-year-old driver who has followed the Yankees
and the Habana Industriales all his life, said he was shocked to
learn he would not be able to attend the game for any price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always go to the stadium, even when there are only 50 to 100
people in the stands,'' he said, scowling under his Yankees cap, as
he attended a daily gathering of baseball fans in Havana's Central
Park . ``But I can't go because I don't have an invitation. I feel
tricked and disgusted.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who did attend the game carried Cuban flags, and
paper flags were distributed. A roar went up at 12:45 p.m. when
Castro wearing his trademark fatigues, walked slowly out on the
field along with other high-ranking officials, crossed the diamond
and greeted the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   After shaking hands with some players from the American side,
Castro huddled with the Cuban team in front of its dugout, making
the most of the imagery of himself as the manager of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Then he retired to front-row seats behind home plate, where he
watched the game with the commissioner of baseball, Bud Selig, and
the Orioles' owner, Peter Angelos, on either side of him. He
chatted with them constantly through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I understand about Castro is he knows a lot about baseball
and he's an absolute fan of the game,'' Angelos said later, adding
that the communist leader had asked a lot of questions about
players' salaries and contracts. The average Cuban player earns
less than $20 a month.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The American delegation was sizable. Besides Selig and Angelos,
representatives of more than 20 major league teams attended the
game, along with two U.S. Sens., Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont and
Jack Reed of Rhode Island. The mayor of Baltimore, Kurt L. Schmoke,
and 60 Little Leaguers from the Washington area also watched.
</P>
<P>
   In seating areas reserved for Orioles supporters and the
diplomatic corps, many of the Americans in attendance said they
felt they were part of a unique experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so emotional,'' said Joel Atlas Skirble, a Washington
lawyer who has taken part in cultural exchanges with Cuba in the
past and was here this time to bring medicines and spend Passover
with Cuban Jews. ``It's the first time in 40 years that `The Star
Spangled Banner' is played here with the president of Cuba
present.''
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat who is among those who have questioned the American
trade embargo on Cuba and called for a review of such policy, Leahy
said that while the game alone would not lead to policy changes, it
sent a signal to both governments that ``the majority of the people
of the countries have no animosity toward each other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People may end up questioning both countries' policies more,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban fans were full of questions about a major league team
with which they were not as familiar as they would have been with
the Atlanta Braves or the Yankees. ``Is Baltimore a state?'' one
fan asked. ``Have the Orioles won a World Series?'' asked another.
</P>
<P>
   As the game began, the crowd settled down. Cuban fans began
sizing up the American starter, Scott Erickson, who narrowly
escaped a disaster in the first inning because of good fielding.
The Cubans began to relax when they saw Luis Ulacia get a base hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Cubans are going to win,'' said Falbello Lazaro, a
45-year-old factory worker. ``They are batting well.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after the Orioles took a 2-0 lead, the faithful in the
bleachers were not cowed. Fans wrapped in flags beat conga drums
and wood blocks, singing, ``Cuba, how beautiful is Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's written in the Bible that Cuba will win today,'' said
Alberto Hernandez, 36. ``We know how to maintain our honor.''
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the eighth, with the Orioles' leading by 2-1,
Cuba's fortunes changed. Linares slapped a ball past the third
baseman into left field, driving in the tying run. ``Cuba! Cuba!''
the crowd yelled again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you we Cubans know how to play ball,'' an excited fan,
Alexander Carmona, 18, said as Linares reached first base. ``All
the little kids here play from the time they can walk. Brazil has
football but we play baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The game remained tied and in the bottom of the 10th Linares had
a second chance to be a hero, coming to the plate with two outs and
men on first and second base. This time, however, he popped up a
ball which was easily caught. The steam went out of the Cuban
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles came back with a run in the top of the 11th, when
Harold Baines drove in Will Clark. The Orioles' defense held in the
bottom of the inning. The fans in the stadium stood to applaud the
Orioles as the two teams shook hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had talent, but we also were able to confront them,''
Miguel Cuevas, a 64-year-old coach who played for the Cuban
national team in the '70s, said after the last out. ``It was a good
game and we played well. We are people that love the Americans.
It's only the politics there we cannot accept. But we are baseball
lovers and the people there are people that love baseball as
well.''

PURDUE AND DUKE SHOW THE GAME'S NEW FACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ They played for the championship of women's
college basketball on Sunday night without a team from the
Southeastern Conference for the first time in five years. And
Tennessee, Louisiana Tech, Stanford, Connecticut _ teams that have
won 11 of 17 National Collegiate Athletic Association titles since
the tournament began in 1982 _ were here when the nationally
televised championship game began.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue and Duke, two teams that have never won a women's
basketball championship, were the new faces. It was a sign, their
coaches said, of the changing face of the women's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more good players than ever,'' Duke coach Gail
Goestenkors said. ``There are more good coaches at every level.
More camps, more clinics. The game is growing at an incredible
pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more than two or three college teams worth watching
and that's great for our game. I think people want a new
champion.''
</P>
<P>
   The swift success of Goestenkors' Duke program is perhaps the
best example of how rapidly the balance of power can now shift in
women's college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   When she arrived at Duke in 1992, the women's program was little
more than a curiosity on campus. Duke had made one trip to the NCAA
tournament and had just eight winning seasons since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember that people laughed at Duke when coach G was
hired,'' Duke guard Hilary Howard said Saturday, referring to
Goestenkors.
</P>
<P>
   The year before Goestenkors took the Duke job, the team was 4-12
in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Goestenkors' first team was 3-13
in the ACC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget that we had to come up from the bottom,''
Goestenkors said on the eve of Sunday night's championship game.
``I had never been on a losing team before as a player, as an
assistant coach _ nothing, never. I was very bad at giving those
postgame speeches when you lose, because I had never heard those
speeches before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to say and that was a humbling experience.
But a very useful one. We worked hard and we convinced a player or
two to take a chance on me, because I was an unproven coach. But
once we got going, we were able to set lofty goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard remembers well her recruiting visit at Duke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been recruited by Connecticut and Virginia,'' Howard
said. ``They were already established, but I had confidence in
coach G. When she talked to me, she talked to me about going to the
Final Four. And she meant it, she wasn't fooling. That impressed me
and it turned out she was right.''
</P>
<P>
   Goestenkors' third Duke team was 22-9 and made the 1995 NCAA
tournament, the first of five consecutive trips to the tournament.
But Duke had never won more than two NCAA games in one season until
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some people are surprised by what we've done this year,
but we're not,'' Goestenkors said. ``It's not as big a leap as it
might seem on the outside. We were getting better all along and our
conference has become more competitive. Look at the quality of the
players we have. That's why we're here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Goestenkors didn't get every player she recruited. One who
got away was Purdue guard Ukari Figgs, whose 24 points was just one
part of a brilliant performance against Louisiana Tech on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I was pretty sure Ukari was going to come to Duke,''
Goestenkors said. ``She made a campus visit and we were surprised
when she did not come to Duke. That was a heartbreaker for us. I
hope she doesn't break my heart again.''
</P>
<P>
   Figgs' four-year career has helped fuel Purdue's ascent as a
national power, which has been nearly as meteoric as Duke's. Purdue
had won a lot more games than Duke in the 1980s and early 1990s but
had never advanced past the NCAA second round until 1994 when the
Boilermakers made their first Final Four trip, losing in the
national semifinals. In 1995 and 1998, Purdue lost in the regional
finals.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Purdue ended Tennessee's 45-game unbeaten streak to
take over the No. 1 spot in the Associated Press poll, only to lose
it within a week. But the Boilermakers won 26 straight games and
finished the season as the top-ranked team in the final poll. They
are just the second Big Ten Conference team to play for the women's
national championship. Ohio State lost to Texas Tech in the title
game in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be great for the Big Ten to have a national champion,
though we don't need it to prove our conference is strong,'' said
Purdue coach Carolyn Peck. ``Our conference has progressed a lot
and already received a lot of recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every little bit helps, but anyone watching women's basketball
now knows the talent level and competition level has gone up. And
not just at the traditional places. The game is being played at a
high level in a lot of places in the country. All you have to do is
look.''
</P>
<P>
   The best place to see it on display Sunday night was the San
Jose Arena, where another breakthrough season in women's college
basketball concluded with the naming of a new champion.

 NEXT RUNG Of TECH EVOLUTION  
 By Jamie Beckett 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR; A refrigerator that makes your grocery list. A microwave that
doubles as an Internet shopping and banking terminal. A wallet-size
card that keeps track of your daughter's homework. A TV that knows
what you like to watch and automatically records your favorite
shows.
</P>
<P>
   These technologies may sound like science fiction, but some are
available now, and many more are in the works in research labs in
Silicon Valley and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few years, companies such as Xerox, Hewlett-Packard,
Philips, Electrolux and NCR hope to introduce a host of smart
wireless devices that could make the PCs of today seem as clumsy as
a phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get to a point where computing is invisible,'' said
Mark Bregmann, who heads a group at IBM dedicated to what the
company calls pervasive computing. ``We're talking about a post-PC
era where people will have access to information and services with
easy-to-use appliances anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody expects PCs to disappear. The idea is to make the
computers, or ``information appliances,'' in our lives ubiquitous,
as much in the background as electricity is today. The
microprocessors embedded in our cars, clocks and VCRs operate this
way _ we don't notice them until they don't work.
</P>
<P>
   The next step: making intelligent devices that can communicate
with one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your phone talked to your TV, the TV could turn down the
sound when you answered the phone. If your microwave talked to your
VCR, it could pause the tape when the popcorn's ready,'' said Mark
Weiser, chief technologist at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   Weiser, credited with inventing the concept of ``ubiquitous
computing,'' is part of a team that's transforming ordinary metal
staples into tiny communication devices. The smart staples could
keep track of where you put things and help you find lost
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea he's researching: electronic wallet-size cards that
could keep track of information such as your child's school
assignments or soccer practice schedule, the menu at your favorite
restaurant, movie times and ski conditions. Each card would have
one purpose, so you'd never have to search for information.
</P>
<P>
   Weiser sees the cards as part of a future of ``calm computing.''
It isn't the computer that's calm, though. It's you, because
everything is working to make your life easier.
</P>
<P>
   In this all-digital future, you might drive a car that can be
tuned remotely, find the nearest Chinese take-out using your
portable global positioning system, and live in a house where your
microwave provides nutritional tips based on your eating habits and
your alarm clock checks the traffic before waking you up.
</P>
<P>
   But as technology moves into this more personal terrain, some
worry about the privacy implications of creating a digital record
of our lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't think for a second that companies aren't going to
exploit the information they have about you,'' said Larry Ponemon,
a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers, cq  &LR; who is an expert on
privacy and business ethics. ``With these conveniences, we're
providing lots of potentially important information about ourselves
that could be used to sell you things or change your behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is it essential that consumers have the option of
turning off data collection, but Ponemon urged that some sort of
third party keep an eye out to make sure businesses that collect
data stick to their promises.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  Others wonder if all these computers are really necessary and if
they will fulfill the promise of making life easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are very, very difficult to make work right,''
said Martin Reynolds, a research fellow at Dataquest in San Jose.
Reynolds uses the example of a device he rigged up in his home that
is supposed to turn things off if a room is empty. The problem is,
if people are sitting on the living-room couch not moving, it shuts
off the lights and TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get mad at me,'' Reynolds said. ``There's a fine line
between technology for technology's sake and technology for
convenience's sake.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the smart microwaves and alarm clocks may be years
away, less-ambitious devices are being rolled out this year.
</P>
<P>
   Philips Electronics will soon be selling a satellite TV receiver
that incorporates technology invented by TiVo, a Sunnyvale startup.
TiVo's Personal Television Service learns what kind of shows you
like to watch and automatically records them. TiVo ( &LR; www.tivo.com &LR; )
will be offering a receiver and the service to consumers this
month. Replay Networks &LR;   &LR; ( &LR; www.replaytv.com &LR; ) of Palo Alto will
release a similar digital VCR next month that allows you to create
your own ``channels'' of your favorite shows. Both devices let you
control live TV broadcasts as if they were videotape; for example,
``pausing'' when the phone rings and then resuming watching.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard recently introduced a high-tech answer to
tearing pages out of magazines or clipping news articles _ a
handheld scanner. The CapShare lets you store information and
images by casually swiping the scanner over a page. You can then
send what you scanned via infrared to a printer, handheld notebook,
PC or personal digital assistant.
</P>
<P>
   More exciting gadgets are in the works.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Screenfridge.  &LR; Down to your last egg? No problem. Just sweep
the carton over your refrigerator's bar-code reader and another
dozen will be on the way. Swedish appliance-maker Electrolux last
month unveiled what it is billing as the first Internet-connected
refrigerator. When you scan a item's bar code, the fridge creates a
digital shopping list to transmit to your grocer. The company plans
to introduce the appliance in Europe next year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Microwave bank.  &LR; NCR is betting consumers will warm to the
idea of a microwave oven that can surf the Web. The Dayton, Ohio,
software-maker last year showed off a prototype of a microwave that
it says puts banking and shopping where consumers want them _ in
the kitchen. The oven also has a TV and a bar-code scanner for
making a digital shopping list. For now, it's still a work in
progress in NCR's lab.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Screen phone.  &LR; Wouldn't it be nice if you could get onto the
Internet without the hassle of booting up your PC, starting Windows
and dialing up your Internet service provider? The screen phone, a
telephone-like appliance that can sit on your kitchen counter, is
one of many devices that could provide one-button Internet access.
Cidco has been selling such a device for almost a year; Alcatel
will release one this summer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Hot tub remote. &LR;  It's a cold, rainy day and you're on you way
home. You think about how nice the hot tub would feel about now.
You push a button on your cellular phone and it turns on the heat
and the bubbles and when you get home, you can just hop into the
tub. IBM is researching a system it internally calls LifeWorks,
where the appliances in your life could share information. Such a
system might make it possible for you to call up your phone
messages on your TV or turn up the thermostat at home from your
car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of this seems like Buck Rogers, but it's doable,'' said
Mitch Stein, senior manager of consumer systems and software at
IBM. What has to happen is that standards have to be set so devices
can share data, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone thinks building a future of smart devices will be
so easy. Eli Zelkha, managing partner at Palo Alto Ventures, a
consulting and venture firm, said the key problem isn't the
technology _ it's making it work for people. He recalled how
researchers in Paris recently developed what they thought was a
superior vacuum cleaner. It had sensors to determine what kind of
floor it was on and would move differently according to each
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Then they asked French housewives to try the new machine. And
instead of liking the sensors, they were frustrated, because they
had their own ways learned over time and now habit,  &LR; of pushing the
vacuum according to what type of floor they were cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``After awhile, they were ready to throw the vacuum against the
wall,'' Zelkha said. What has to happen, he said, is that machines
should adapt to people, not vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The machines should be in the background as slaves, rather
than in the foreground as something we worship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What's driving all this? One thing is the Internet. Consumers
want access to the information and services on the Net, and they
want it available when they're away from their PCs. At the same
time, computer chips are becoming so small and so cheap that it's
possible to put lots of them everywhere _ in clothes, cars,
appliances, even eyeglasses.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the idea of wearable computers has fascinated many
researchers, who've fashioned prototype after prototype of
enormous, geeky eyeglasses with a screen attached. Sometime soon,
wearable computers could become palatable to the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard is talking with an Italian eyewear-maker about
finding a way to make a good-looking pair of computing glasses.
Even if they're not high fashion, the glasses might be used by
surgeons, warehouse workers and others who may need to receive
information but keep their hands free.
</P>
<P>
   The computer giant, which is also working on badges that would
let you identify yourself to your computer without using a
password, sees such innovations as crucial to its ability to
compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to try hard to differentiate yourself in commodity
businesses like PCs or laptops,'' said Fred Kitson, manager of
visual computing at HP Labs. ``People can easily use appliances
like toasters and mixers. The idea is to evolve computers in that
direction.''

 CONSULTING FIRM SHOWS CLIENTS THE FUTURE
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Benny Evangelista &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
You walk into a discount store to buy a new VCR and find a model
you like.
</P>
<P>
   You whip out your Pocket Bargain Finder. The handheld, wireless
device swiftly scans the World Wide Web and finds the same VCR
offered by an online electronics seller for 25 percent less than
the discount store's price.
</P>
<P>
   So you punch in an online order on the bargain finder and leave
the store having saved $50.
</P>
<P>
   The Pocket Bargain Finder isn't for sale yet. It's one of
several futuristic inventions like a ``magic wall'' and an
``awareness machine'' dreamed up by Andersen cq  &LR; Consulting's
Center for Strategic Technology Research in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the 4-year-old center say a device like the
bargain finder could soon find its way into consumers' hands
because the technology behind it already exists.
</P>
<P>
   Such a device would be a money-saving tool for consumers,
especially on big-ticket items. It would also force traditional
retailers to change their business practices to prevent losing
customers _ perhaps having their own Web links to make sure they
don't get beat on prices.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the world's biggest business consulting firm has a
team of about 160 researchers in three locations around the world
trying to invent the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business bridges that gap between what technology can do
and what business needs to have done,'' said Joe Carter, an
Andersen partner who heads Andersen's technology research. ``We
answer the basic question of, `What the hell is it good for?'''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than creating products to sell, the researchers are
trying to imagine how technology being invented by local firms like
Hewlett-Packard, Intel Corp. and 3Com Corp. can affect Andersen's
clients, major corporations that need to develop business plans to
react to changes over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   The success of online bookseller Amazon.com and the resulting
decline in revenues for ``brick and mortar'' bookstores is a vivid
example of how rapid technological advances can catch traditional
businesses off guard if they don't think ahead, Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of ANDERSEN (68773 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``Technology has not connected to the business community,''
Carter said. ``Likewise, businesses can't stay current with new
business technology at the velocity it's going.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the main lab on Page Mill Road, Andersen has
researchers in Chicago and Sophia-Antipolis, France. Researchers
come from a variety of disciplines, including computer science,
sociology and anthropology.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen corporate executives visit the centers each week to
see and touch real-life applications of new technology, get exposed
to fresh ideas and have their existing business models challenged.
</P>
<P>
   That experience is more useful than reading a white paper about
``another gee-whiz new technology,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pocket Bargain Finder, for example, is a cross between a
PalmPilot, a bar code scanner, a wireless phone and an Internet
search engine. Andersen's research team wrote new software that
tied those devices into a prototype bargain hunter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Some Andersen clients may bring a form of pocket finders to
consumers in the next 12 to 18 months, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea is the Magic Wall, a flat panel video screen that
scans a person's identity card, such as a security card, and
automatically dispenses pertinent information tailored to that
person.
</P>
<P>
   A prototype 42-inch Magic Wall hanging inside Andersen's Palo
Alto center greets visitors by their first name and displays a
schedule of their upcoming meetings or up-to-the-minute traffic and
weather reports from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen also is crafting a ``virtual call center,'' which would
allow companies to decentralize large customer service centers.
</P>
<P>
   The idea weaves together Internet telephony, corporate
Intranets, and desktop computers to allow customer service
representatives to work at home. There, the employees could process
phone orders as they would in a central office cubicle, but save
the company real estate costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made an internal announcement (to Andersen consultants)
about it a couple of weeks ago and overnight we had 40 big
companies who wanted to take a look at it,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   The wall and several other Andersen inventions use a software
agent called Munin, named after the Norse god of memory, a raven
that every morning scoured the earth for the latest news to report
to the chief god Odin.
</P>
<P>
   The wall and a portable device use Munin to become an
``awareness machine'' that scours the Internet and other sources
for news. A pharmaceutical salesperson, for example, could have the
latest drug industry news delivered in time for important meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be combing the Web every day and every night for
information'' you need, said Chad Burkey, an Andersen senior
research scientist who wrote Munin.
</P>
<P>
   When an executive with AT&AMP;T visited the center recently, 20
minutes before he arrived, the Munin technology provided Andersen
consultants with a joke he had told two days before in a speech and
a news story about his latest promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about the way we as humans go through our lives,
we leave traces everywhere,'' Burkey said. ``If I send an e-mail,
there's a time stamp on it. Munin is intended to gather up these
little scraps and try to understand a holistic picture about us in
order to better deliver information that can help us out.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The researchers have also developed a wearable computer for
mobile workers like warehouse and maintenance employees who cannot
be chained to a desktop.
</P>
<P>
   For example, an electrician fixing a rooftop air conditioner can
use the hands-free device, which has a small eye-sized screen
affixed to a headset, to access computerized schematic designs of
the unit and to order replacement parts.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said one of the center's early accomplishments was
identifying the current trend toward Internet commerce. Four years
ago its researchers looked at a Java precursor made for interactive
television and told clients its real worth was for selling products
on the Internet, Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   The center has become crucial for Andersen because the
consulting firm's reputation is built upon advising companies on
how to adapt and plan for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue for Andersen, (KPMG) Peat Marwick and any of those
guys is to not go into a project and get caught flat-footed,'' said
technology analyst and consultant Tim Bajarin, president of
Creative Strategies Inc. in Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd better have a place where you're already understanding
how to use (new technology), how to integrate it and how to
customize it,'' Bajarin said.
</P>
<P>
   While other consulting companies have research arms, none are as
big as Andersen's, which ``had the most foresight of the consulting
companies in understanding this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen Consulting, based in New York, reported 1998 revenues
of $8.3 billion, a 25 percent jump from the previous year. The
privately owned consulting firm is in the middle of a split from
its partner, the accounting firm Arthur Andersen LLP.
</P>
<P>
   The research arm's main mission is to support Andersen's
lucrative consulting business, and Carter said Andersen has no
plans to try to make and sell inventions directly to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   However, the research arm is defending its patents ``more
aggressively,'' Carter said. And it is evolving into a line of
business for Andersen that could is expected  &LR; eventually to &LR; 
 &LR; generate $1 billion in revenues annually as the company designs
and installs new technology for corporations, he added.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the researchers may be working with technologies
that don't even exist today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now live in a world where the capacity for invention
exceeds our imagination,'' Carter said.

OPEN SCORING NOT OPEN-AND-SHUT CASE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Oscar De La Hoya and Bob Arum, his promoter, have
joined those who want to institute open scoring.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the score after each round, they believe,
will prevent decisions like that of the disastrous Evander
Holyfield-Lennox Lewis bout on March 13 and, as De La Hoya put it,
``clean up the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Arum already has filed an application with the Nevada Athletic
Commission to employ open scoring for the May 8 bout between Erik
Morales and Wayne McCullough. If it's implemented and gets good
reviews, they hope, it might then be used in De La Hoya's title
defense against Oba Carr on May 22.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya and Arum should be commended for any efforts to clean
up the sport. It certainly needs it.
</P>
<P>
   However, the implementation of open scoring isn't the answer: It
would radically alter a sport that is as rich in admirable
tradition as it is soiled with so many vile incidents. Instead, the
powers that be should find better judges.
</P>
<P>
   Arum makes some good points.
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``It's one thing to learn about the crime after it's
happened, like March 13. It's another thing to see the crime
happening as it goes along. A lot of people who are pulling off a
crime don't have the guts to see it exposed to the public as it's
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   True. However, he also admits boxing would have to make a
significant sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   The often dramatic reading of the decision _ which is unique to
boxing _ can be one of the most thrilling moments in sports.
Indeed, is there a more intense scene than two fighters pacing the
ring as the scores are being read after a close fight?
</P>
<P>
   And that's not to mention the drama leading up to a decision:
The round-by-round speculation as to who is winning is part of the
fun of boxing for the fans.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, it doesn't make sense to sacrifice one of the most
!ital!appealing aspects of the sport to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are more practical issues.
</P>
<P>
   Most significantly, fighters who build insurmountable leads will
coast in the later rounds. Many bouts will, in effect, be over by
the eighth or ninth round.
</P>
<P>
   Arum used the NFL as an example of how open scoring works. It
could also be used as an example of how it !ital!wouldn't
</P>
<P>
   work in boxing. If a football team is leading by three
touchdowns in the fourth quarter, it sucks the drama out of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Is that what boxing wants? Two, three, four rounds that put
viewers to sleep?
</P>
<P>
   That's only one example of potential problems. Among others:
Judges could be influenced by the scoring of the other judges or
the reaction of the crowd; fans could become unruly mid-fight if
they object to the scoring; and open scoring certainly would have
an impact on how others _ trainers, referees and doctors _ operate
and change the essence of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the answer is the judges themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Lynch, executive director of the California Athletic
Commission, said his organization rejects judges all the time.
That's what's needed: Extremely close scrutiny of prospective
judges and the willingness to reject or even ban them if they are
found to be biased _ for whatever reason _ or their scoring is
outrageously out of line.
</P>
<P>
   A good example is Eugenia Williams, the judge who scored the
March 13 fight 115-113 for Holyfield even though Lewis was the
clear winner: She should never be allowed to work a fight again and
should serve as an example of what will happen to rogue judges.
</P>
<P>
   Arum doesn't buy such an approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you know?'' he said, referring to the judges'
integrity. ``How do you ever know when the scores are kept secret
until the very end?
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you know you're not getting jobbed by some guy who's
behind on his mortgage payments or has declared bankruptcy? How do
you know?''
</P>
<P>
   You don't. However, you also don't know the damage such a
monumental change as open scoring might have on a sport that has
thrived for generations the way it is.
</P>
<P>
   Protest: America Presents, which promotes McCullough, will file
a protest if open scoring is used for the Morales-McCullough fight.
</P>
<P>
   The promotional company is against the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solution isn't telling the fans the score and the decision
beforehand,'' America Presents said in a statement. ``It's in
improving the quality of officiating and divorcing the inherent
monetary conflicts that currently exists between promoters and
officials.''
</P>
<P>
   New and improved? Goodbye De La Hoya the master ring technician.
Hello De La Hoya the banger.
</P>
<P>
   The WBC welterweight champion said last week that he could win
``easily without taking any risks'' and continue to make millions.
However, he hasn't fought that way in his past two fights _ against
Julio Cesar Chavez and Ike Quartey _ and said he plans to become
even more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   So why do it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``That's a good question.''
</P>
<P>
   Not really. His reasoning is obvious and admirable: He wants to
please the fans and enhance his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is the effect it might have on him: One, he's at
greater risk of losing this way and, two, he's beginning to take
damaging punches to the head.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya should take a step back and ask himself: Is it worth
it?
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya-Trinidad update: Arum, who has met with Don King,
Felix Trinidad's promoter, believes there's a 60 percent chance the
two will fight in September.
</P>
<P>
   Arum said he and King have agreed to the basic structure of a
contract but must still work out the details.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm optimistic that this fight can be made,'' he said. ``One
thing I'm certain of, both Oscar and Trinidad want to fight each
other. Once that's established, it's a lot easier to find a way to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Baby watch: De La Hoya's fiance, actress Shanna Moakler, was due
to give birth to the couple's first child Sunday. They know it's a
girl and have named her Atiana.
</P>
<P>
   More Moakler: She said she's a lifelong boxing fan but, like
many fighters' loved ones, finds it difficult to watch De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she knows only secondhand that De La Hoya knocked
down Quartey in the 12th round of their dramatic Feb. 13 fight even
though she was there: She couldn't watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``By that time, my heart was dying,'' she said. ``I didn't even
know that Oscar knocked him down. I wasn't even looking. I was
looking away, watching the clock, waiting for the seconds to tick
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Oscar had him against the ropes (and was pounding away)
in the 12th, I did look, though. I was like, `You go baby.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit punches: Arum said King has assured him that the
Holyfield-Lewis rematch will not happen before October. September
had been mentioned but that would conflict with De La Hoya's
defense that month.
</P>
<P>
   Arum expects the heavyweight rematch to take place in November.
. . .
</P>
<P>
   If the fight with Trinidad cannot be made, De La Hoya's short
list for possible opponents for September is: Quartey, Pernell
Whitaker and Spaniard Javier Castillejo.
</P>
<P>
   Castillejo could end up being De La Hoya's opponent in December
at the new Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Another fighter who could _ or should _ be in the mix is Derrell
Coley, who recently joined America Presents. He's the No. 1
contender for De La Hoya's WBC welterweight title. . . . A bout
between Miguel Angel Gonzalez and Kostya Tszyu has not been set for
May 15, as is being reported. However, the fighters' handlers are
close to an agreement. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Michael Nunn is still at it. The 35-year-old former champ will
face William Guthrie in a 10-round light heavyweight bout on May 9
in Minot, N.D. &QL;

 &QL; 
Before the ``delete'' key, there was Ko-Rec-Type.
</P>
<P>
   Before toner cartridges, there were mimeograph stencils.
</P>
<P>
   And long before multifunction, handheld calculators, there was
the Addiator Hand Adding Machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how quickly these items were forgotten,'' said
Gary Luiza, president of Penny Wise Office Products of Bowie, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The mail-order house this month came up with a list of
once-common office supplies that have become scarce or extinct,
pushed aside by the rush of desktop computers, fax machines and
other new technology.
</P>
<P>
   Luiza said his staff searched sales records and old catalogs to
find obsolete office products as a way to chart the ``evolution of
the office products industry.''
</P>
<P>
   One example they found was the slide rule, which as recently as
the 1970s hung from engineers' belt loops. These devices looked
like rulers and were used to do complex mathematical calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Luiza said, ``You can get a calculator for $15 that can do
100 times what the slide rule could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly enough, Luiza said calculator sales have fallen
off in the last four years because office workers have come to rely
more on computer software like Microsoft Excel.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the products that over time could be gone,'' he
said. ``Calculators will be replaced by the palm-top or handheld
computers that can do more. We're going to look at people in 10
years standing on a street corner pulling these out of their pocket
to get their e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few more office products on their way to the scrap
heap:
</P>
<P>
   _Mimeograph stencils. Baby Boomers will remember when sniffing
freshly printed purple mimeograph copies was the highlight of the
school day. The mimeograph and the stencils that were used to make
copies of the original master documents hung on in schools and some
offices into the late 1980s, but have given way to cheaper, easier
photocopiers and printers.
</P>
<P>
   _Typewriter ribbon. It's rare to find a manual typewriter in an
office anymore, but Luiza occasionally hears from an old typewriter
stalwart looking for a ribbon. He said he can locate one, ``usually
after a series of phone calls.''
</P>
<P>
   _Ko-Rec-Type. Before the days of cut-and-paste software and
spell checkers, Ko-Rec-Type was the savior of any typist who needed
to fix those errant keystrokes. The little piece of plastic tape
masked the mistake with a white film. Ko-Rec-Type is still
available, but only in limited supplies.
</P>
<P>
   _Erasable paper. Offices stopped ordering erasable onionskin
paper in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   _Kil-Klatter pads. These plastic rectangles were used as a pad
between a typewriter and an old wooden or metal desk and did what
their name said _ killed, or at least muffled, the clatter made by
a roomful of those machines. They disappeared from office supply
catalogs around 1982. ``These are truly things of the past. I can't
even lay my hands on a set of those,'' Luiza said.
</P>
<P>
   _Eyeshades. Corporate bean counters wore these transparent green
visors, which were supposed to be  &LR; shade harsh office light, thus
saving their eyes while they spent hours poring over documents. The
advent of softer fluorescent lighting, and maybe the Fashion
Police, banished this headgear into retirement around 1975, Luiza
said.
</P>
<P>
   _Sandy Pointers. Long before there were electric pencil
sharpeners with automatic shut off, pencils were ground into points
with these handheld, sandpaper-covered paddles. They disappeared
from office supply lists around 1974, Luiza said.
</P>
<P>
   _Cuffettes. In the days of stain-causing mimeograph solvent,
smudgy typewriter ribbon and messy carbon paper, office workers
wore Cuffettes to cover the ends of their white shirt sleeves.
``They maybe lasted into the '80s, but nobody wears them today,''
Luiza said.
</P>
<P>
   _Addiator Hand Adding Machine. This abacus-like device employed
a sliding bar to make calculations. They disappeared from catalogs
in 1970.

 FILES _ SF CHRON   Net Gaming Ban Faces Long Odds 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
Conservative U.S. Senator Jon Kyl is rolling the dice again in his
personal crusade to rid the Internet of gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Republican shuffled the deck last week, introducing
a watered-down version of the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act _
which failed to pass the full Congress last year. Kyl is betting
the new version will establish a national law banning online
wagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet gambling is addictive, accessible to minors, subject
to fraud and other criminal use,'' Kyl said in a statement. ``We
need to update the law to help it keep up with technology and close
the loopholes that have allowed this activity to flourish.''
</P>
<P>
   He faces steep odds.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new version eliminates a thorny provision that
would have punished virtual bettors with fines of up to $500 and
jail terms as long as three months, many in the online gambling
business question whether the legislation will dampen the
proliferation of virtual casinos.
</P>
<P>
   The $1 billion industry has mushroomed from a dozen companies
two years ago to about 200 today. Most of the virtual casinos are
based in exotic locales such as the Caribbean and Central America,
far from U.S. law-enforcement authorities.

   A spokesman for the California attorney general's office in
Sacramento acknowledged it would be difficult to pinpoint
individuals gambling online. Internet service providers, meanwhile,
are balking at being thrust into the position of enforcing the law
by blocking their customers from gaming sites.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-gambling bill also faces opposition from the
influential horse racing industry; American Civil Liberties Union;
and the ISP Consortium, a Minneapolis organization that represents
300 Internet service providers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need is regulation that protects the consumer _ not
outright prohibition,'' said Sue Schneider, chairwoman of the
Interactive Gaming Council, a Vancouver, British Columbia, group
promoting online gambling. ``Kyl's bill is malarkey.''
</P>
<P>
   Like its earlier incarnation, Kyl's latest bill would punish
individuals running gambling sites with prison terms of four years
and fines of up to $20,000. The ban does not apply to state
lotteries and off-track betting that employ computer systems
unavailable to the general public.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, it exempts sites for popular sports ``rotisserie''
leagues, in which consumers pick professional athletes and bet on
their statistics. ``The bill is filled with holes; it's Swiss
cheese,'' Schneider said.
</P>
<P>
   The exceptions are designed to appease powerful lobbying groups,
but probably won't carry the bill through Congress, gambling
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gambling is always a politicized issue,'' said Sebastian
Sinclair, an analyst with Christiansen Cummings Associates, a New
York gambling consulting firm. He said if Kyl's latest bill fails,
as many expect, other legislation will follow and a bill eventually
will pass. ``Lawmakers will eventually find a way,'' Sinclair said.
``This is just part of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Memo to Senator Kyl: Your bill is a longshot. Maybe it's time to
know when to fold 'em.

   _AUTHOR, AUTHOR: The rags-to-riches-to-rags story of Apple
Computer has always had a Shakespearean appeal to business writers.
Few high-tech companies have elicited such dramatic prose,
microscopic analysis and detailed reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Two more entrants in the growing library of Apple books _
Michael Malone's definitive ``Infinite Loop'' and Owen Linzmayer's
no-frills ``Apple Confidential'' _ delve into the social and
political forces that turned a garage startup into an American
icon.
</P>
<P>
   Malone's 584-page tome, subtitled ``How Apple, the World's Most
Insanely Great Computer Company, Went Insane,'' offers
painstakingly Halberstam-esque insight into the minutiae behind the
Cupertino legend and what went wrong (hence the thick volume).
</P>
<P>
   Malone, who is host of a PBS interview program and editor of
Forbes ASAP, unearths dozens of nuggets. &UR;  &LR; Among them: How Steve
Jobs on several occasions ``ripped off'' money and ideas from Steve
Wozniak, his best friend and Apple co-founder. When Woz found out,
he wept and kept Jobs at arm's length.
</P>
<P>
   Linzmayer gives readers a bird's eye view of the once
high-flying computer-maker. In 244 pages, the free-lance journalist
provides plenty of photos, charts, time lines and illustrations
dating to Apple's origin in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Insight is sparse, but Linzmayer's book is an excellent textbook
for Apple historians.

 With 1990s Detective Work, It's Hereditary 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Genetic forensics has become the newest and perhaps most
controversial tool in the crime fighter's arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially true in cases like the Yosemite murders, where
bodies have been burned to destroy evidence, and bone fragments or
blood smears may be all that remains to establish guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only need a pinprick of material to make an
identification,'' said Sean Walsh, research director at the Applied
Biosystems division of Perkin-Elmer Corp. in Foster City.
</P>
<P>
   The company is the leading supplier of the $75,000 systems that
police labs use to obtain genetic IDs. Walsh explained how the
process works.
</P>
<P>
   First, investigators scour crime scenes for blood, saliva, semen
or bits of skin. The size of the sample hardly matters. The
machines only require a few cells to get at the DNA inside our
chromosomes.
</P>
<P>
   In the lab, genetic forensics experts turn these cells into a
chemical brew, from which they skim off a minute amount of DNA.
Using a technique called PCR, the equipment replicates this DNA
sample a hundred thousand times over, creating a glob of material
large enough to analyze.
</P>
<P>
   As Walsh explained, all of us have the same basic genetic code.
But the Federal Bureau of Investigation has identified 13 spots on
12 chromosomes where each of us have what is thought to be a short,
unique DNA sequence _ a sort of genetic fingerprint.
</P>
<P>
   Mixing chemical dyes with the DNA sample, then subjecting the
material to a powerful electric shock, the machines sort out the
lengths of these 13 markers. The test results look like a bar-code
printed in blue, green and yellow. It is the length and arrangement
of those colored bars that set each of us apart, Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic tests have proven so powerful at helping prove guilt or
innocence _ DNA evidence has freed some who were wrongly convicted
_ that many law enforcement officials are pushing to expand the
database of DNA samples.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesman Paul Bresson said all 50 states have laws
requiring some people _ usually convicted sex offenders, rapists or
murderers _ to submit DNA samples.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the states have amassed 700,000 samples, of which
270,000 have been analyzed. ``The labs are getting backed up,''
Bresson said.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago Attorney General Janet Reno appointed a federal
commission to study whether it would be constitutional to require
every person charged with a crime to submit a DNA sample. Louisiana
hasn't waited. It is so far the only state to require DNA tests
upon arrest.
</P>
<P>
   But privacy advocates are leery of the growing use of DNA tests,
which they consider far more invasive than fingerprinting.
</P>
<P>
   When we get fingerprinted, for instance, we get our fingers
back. Not so with DNA tests, said Barry Steinhardt of the American
Civil Liberties Union. Authorities don't just take a genetic
fingerprint. They keep the blood or tissue sample, which gives them
the ability to do new and more potent tests in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Massachusetts, at around the same time (circa 1997) they
passed a DNA testing law, they created a commission to study the
biological causes of crime,'' Steinhardt said. ``You already have
scientists talking about things like gay genes. How long before
they start looking for the genetic markers that might indicate a
propensity to crime?''
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Steinhardt says police labs should take DNA
prints and destroy the samples, making the new tests more like
fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   But the Department of Defense, which began collecting DNA
samples in 1992 to help identify those killed in action, has about
3 million blood specimens it plans to keep for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; x  &LR;  If you don't buy the fear that DNA files might be expanded
or abused, Marc Rotenberg of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center suggests we consider the evolution of other databases.
Remember, people in the 1930s were promised their Social Security
numbers wouldn't be used for identification.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, banks are fingerprinting people for cashing checks
or using ATMS,'' Rotenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, as DNA tests get faster and cheaper _ and researchers are
already testing DNA chips that do quick IDs from saliva _ we might
one day walk up to an ATM and spit.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this may sound farfetched, but it does indicate why
business is booming 30 to 40 percent a year at Applied Biosystems
in Foster City. In fact business is so good, the division will soon
expand across the bay into a new 66,000-square-foot distribution
center in Hayward.
</P>
<P>
   But don't get the idea that DNA testing is just about crime and
punishment and science fiction nightmares of genetic
discrimination. (For more on that, rent the movie ``Gattaca!'')
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Heron, general manager of the Foster City division, said
her firm has taken genetic samples from some 40,000 dogs a year to
provide scientific proof that their puppies had the proper
pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today you rely on a breeder signing an affidavit,'' Heron
said. ``People would like to have better documentation.''

EDITORIAL: QUESTIONING THREE GORGES DAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, March 29:
</P>
<P>
   In China, where even a slight relaxation in suppression of
debate can indicate a softening of official policy, it is
encouraging that some publications have cast an increasingly
critical eye on the Three Gorges Dam being built on the Yangtze
River.
</P>
<P>
   The official line is that there is no turning back on a project
that will destroy one of the world's great scenic areas, inundate
hundreds of archaeological sites and force 1.3 million people to
resettle elsewhere when the dam's 400-mile reservoir floods towns
and farmlands.
</P>
<P>
   But the insoluble social, environmental and technical problems
that have plagued the project cannot be wished away, and they may
now be getting some consideration.
</P>
<P>
   The dam has been a matter of internal disagreement within the
Communist Party for some time. As far back as 1956, a vice minister
of electric power, Li Rui, produced a report arguing for smaller
dams on tributaries of the Yangtze rather than a 600-foot behemoth
at the Three Gorges.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, when the final vote to approve the Three Gorges project
was taken in the National People's Congress, a third of the
delegates abstained or voted against it, even though the dam was
championed by Li Peng, who was then prime minister. But all public
debate on the project has been banned since the Tiananmen
demonstrations in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   So it is noteworthy that the Chinese journal Strategy and
Management, a publication with some links to the government,
printed an article by a scholar under a pseudonym detailing the
failure of resettlement efforts so far, and the extreme problems of
relocating hundreds of thousands of people into steep hillsides
that are barely habitable.
</P>
<P>
   In February, People's Daily, the party-controlled paper, ran
articles on engineering issues and problems with excavating
cultural relics that would be destroyed in the flood zone. Other
papers have reported on official corruption connected to the
project. Chinese media reports have also noted that existing
flood-control systems and older dams are neglected and in danger of
collapse as attention is diverted to new projects like Three
Gorges.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, who is considered
neutral on the project, raised concerns about the project's safety
and suggested it may be necessary to bring in international experts
to monitor the engineering. Li Peng, who now heads the National
People's Congress, is expected to fight any retreat on the project.
But the thaw in repression of criticism suggests that altering and
even halting the project may yet be possible.
</P>
<P>
   That is why it is crucial for American financial institutions to
refrain from underwriting bonds for Chinese entities, like the
State Development Bank, that finance construction of the dam. China
cannot finance the dam, which is expected to cost well over $25
billion, without foreign capital. The U.S. Export-Import Bank and
the World Bank have refused to support the project, because of its
disastrous environmental and social consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The world is beginning to change its views on large dams. The
World Bank has sponsored creation of the independent World
Commission on Dams to assess the effectiveness of such projects and
alternatives, with a report due next year. Major dams have been
stopped in midconstruction in Malaysia, India and Eastern Europe
when the governments found that the benefits were uncertain and the
costs enormous.
</P>
<P>
   The Three Gorges Dam is a throwback to failed development
strategies of decades past. This is an important moment to show
China's leaders that the international community wants no part of
this destructive, gargantuan project.

`NATURE'S' CALL KEEPS IT AT NO. 1
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Moviegoers continued to shower affection on
``Forces of Nature'' as the romantic comedy took in an estimated
$9.6 million at 2,224 theaters to top a moderate national box
office weekend, studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The DreamWorks release, with Sandra Bullock and Ben Affleck,
showed staying power with a 29 percent decline from its opening
weekend. ``We feel we did well in a marketplace with so many
movies,'' said studio marketing executive Don Harris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forces,'' which has hit $27 million in 10 days, edged
Universal's opening of ``EDtv'' with $9 million at 2,626 theaters
and Warner Bros.' fourth weekend of ``Analyze This'' with $8.8
million at 2,537 sites as comedies aimed at adult moviegoers
dominated at the nation's multiplexes.
</P>
<P>
   MGM's opening of ``Mod Squad'' followed in fourth with a
lukewarm $6 million at 2,220 theaters and Disney's debut of its
low-cost ``Doug's First Movie'' finished fifth with a modest $4.4
million at 2,268 sites. Disney marketing executive Chuck Viane
noted the animated entry is well-positioned to take advantage of
heavy moviegoing by children on spring vacation during the next
several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first weekend this year without a film topping the
$10 million mark. ``The weekend is not a disaster, but it is
disappointing,'' said movie analyst Arthur Rockwell. ``The new
films clearly fell short of expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source tracking service,
said ``EDtv'' faced numerous obstacles including lack of a major
star, holdover competition from ``Forces of Nature'' and ``Analyze
This'' and the problem of selling a movie similar to Jim Carrey's
hit ``The Truman Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It really does pay to be first,'' he noted, adding that
``EDtv'' _ a Ron Howard film once seen as a potential hit for the
troubled studio _ will be hard-pressed to top $30 million by the
end of its domestic run. ``The Truman Show'' is 101st on the
all-time list with U.S. grosses of $126.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Universal marketing chief Nikki Rocco expressed optimism, noting
exit polling showed above-average scores and pointing out that
movies directed by Howard tend to perform well following their
opening weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell, a former MGM executive, said ``Mod Squad'' represented
the weekend's biggest disappointment following an extensive
campaign aimed at teen and young adult customers. ``They had high
hopes it was going to be a hit but it looks like it's going to be
in home video before we know it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love'' drew a 33 percent boost from its seven
Academy Awards, including Best Picture, as it finished sixth with
$4 million at 1,931 theaters, 526 more than last weekend. Its
overall gross has hit $79 million after 108 days for Miramax.
</P>
<P>
   Warner's second weekend of Death Row drama ``True Crime'' fell
37 percent in sixth place to $3.3 million at 1,852 theaters,
followed by Miramax's expanded run of ``Life Is Beautiful'' with $3
million at 1,121 sites as the studio added 474 theaters to take
advantage of its three Oscars. ``Life Is Beautiful'' has now
grossed $40.4 million after 23 weeks in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's third weekend of ``Baby Geniuses'' continued to overcome
poor reviews in ninth with $2.7 million at 1,702 theaters, followed
by its fourth weekend of ``Cruel Intentions'' with $2.4 million at
1,951 locations. Warner's second weekend of ``The King and I'' lost
half its audience to finish 11th with $2 million at 2,352 sites.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks' ``Saving Private Ryan,'' with five Oscars including
Best Director, matched its gross from last weekend with $1 million
at 655 theaters to push its total to $211.7 million. ``Ryan''
trails ``Aladdin'' by $5.3 million for the 21st spot on the
all-time domestic chart.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax's romantic drama ``A Walk on the Moon'' posted solid
results in a limited opening with $73,000 at seven theaters.
British romantic comedy ``Among Giants'' grossed $14,000 at two
sites for Fox Searchlight.
</P>
<P>
   Overall grosses hit about $68 million, down about 20 percent
from the same weekend a year ago when the 15th weekend of
``Titanic'' led the box office. Year-to-date grosses have topped
$1.2 billion, trailing the 1998 period by about 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Two new movies will open Wednesday _ Sony's sci-fi thriller
``The Matrix'' and Disney's teen comedy ``10 Things I Hate About
You'' _ while Paramount will debut romantic comedy ``The
Out-of-Towners'' on Friday. Bucksbaum said ``The Matrix'' and ``10
Things'' should perform well due to the usual upsurge in moviegoing
by teens and young adults during spring break with each taking in
about $15 million on the Friday-Sunday weekend.

WAVES OF HUMANITY JOIN EXODUS FROM KOSOVO

<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ Nearly 15,000 refugees flooded over a remote
and desolate border from Kosovo into Albania Sunday, a desperate
wave of humanity that spelled a costly calamity for Europe's
poorest nation.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands more ethnic Albanians streamed across the border at
Blace, Macedonia, telling stories of terror, expulsion, extortion,
and murder at the hands of Serbian forces in a campaign that
expanded dramatically after NATO launched a bombing campaign in
hopes of halting a year of systematic violence in Kosovo, a
province of Yugoslavia. Some refugees begged NATO to send in ground
troops to end what they called a wholesale slaughter and ``ethnic
cleansing'' of Kosovar Albanian villages.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kula Pass into Montenegro, still more walked across the
border in a steady stream, emerging as silhouettes of misery and
fear through a thick fog. Most were afraid to say anything.
</P>
<P>
   In all, more than half a million people have been displaced
inside Kosovo, according to United Nations figures.
</P>
<P>
   At the Albanian border, ``it's getting out of control,'' said
Andrea Angelli, spokesman for the Organization on Security and
Cooperation in Europe, speaking in Tirana, the capital. ``We're not
able to count the people anymore. It's hell up there now.''
</P>
<P>
   Some refugees had arrived half-clothed, and some children were
barefoot as they made the grueling journey over the rocky mountain
paths leading from Kosovo to northern Albania, a senior Western
diplomat reported. Many had been ``gathered in groups and herded to
the border'' by Serb forces, the diplomat added.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pretty clearly a concerted effort'' by the Serbs to
drive out the Albanians, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian government put the number of refugees there so far
at 20,000, with Sunday's influx the biggest so far, at times
arriving at the rate of 1,000 an hour. In Montenegro, a refugee
official put the number in Albania as high as 24,000, with another
20,000 in Macedonia and 8,000 in Montenegero.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav government, however, denied allegations of a
Serbian campaign against ethnic Albanians. Government-run
television carried an interview with Vuk Draskovic, the federal
deputy prime minister, who said it was the Albanians who were
committing atrocities against Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you know that 50 years ago there was 50 percent Serbs in
Kosovo and now only 10 percent? Where are they? Who expelled
them?'' he asked. ``We are victims of combined crimes of NATO and
Albanian terrorists. They are killing hundreds of Serbs right now
in Kosovo. . . . I am telling the truth, so help me God.''
</P>
<P>
   But the testimony of terrified ethnic Albanians fleeing Kosovo
contradicted his claims. Mothers comforted crying children in cars
packed with families fleeing what they said were systematic and
brutal attacks by Serbian forces. Some families fled burning
villages in horse-and-carriages, some on tractors, and some walked
over mountain passes.
</P>
<P>
   Their stories were impossible to verify independently because
there are few international observers or journalists still in
Kosovo, but many accounts suggested that hundreds of ethnic
Albanians had been killed in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid the Serbs will totally cleanse Kosovo,'' said Ilaz
Ramajli, head of the Tirana office of the self-styled Republic of
Kosova.
</P>
<P>
   A small minority of those fleeing were able to bring some
belongings with them, Angelli said. In many cases, Yugoslav
authorities took the refugees' personal items, along with their
identity papers. Those who were able to bring tractors or cars into
Albania had their license tags removed, making it harder to return
home, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sign that the Serbs don't want them back anymore,''
Angelli said.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Albania _ poor, undeveloped and virtually without paved
roads _ is a formidable border at best. Earlier, Yugoslavs had
closed the few border crossings and mined some of them. But about
five days ago, the Serbs abruptly opened the border and swept the
mines, creating an enforced escape route to funnel ethnic Albanians
out, Angelli and others said.
</P>
<P>
   A 25-year-old man, shot while he was still on the Kosovo side of
the border, struggled over the mountains only to die Sunday in an
Albanian hospital, aid workers said. An elderly refugee man also
died of apparent heart failure, and four people arrived wounded at
a border Albanian hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone from the tiny village of Goden fled last week,
telling Western observers in Albania that about 20 schoolteachers
had been shot in front of their students.
</P>
<P>
   A line of refugees more than 4 miles long was making its way
from the Kosovar town of Pec to the Montenegro border, Ramajli
said. He said the report, given via telephone by a witness to the
scene, had not yet been confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   In Montenegro, several who had fled from Pec earlier described
their ordeal Sunday through a translator. ``They put a shotgun to
our throats and told us to leave,'' said Burim, a 27-year old
farmer who had fled a village outside Pec. ``They are going
door-to-door and forcing everyone out.''
</P>
<P>
   Besem, 27, who asked that his family not be used, said he had to
leave behind four brothers, his father, and mother, as he escaped
from Pec, the seat of the Serbian Orthodox Church and one of the
areas where Serbs appeared to be concentrating their campaign of
terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am afraid for their lives,'' Besem said. ``The Serbian
police are breaking into houses, taking jewelry, televisions,
everything they can get their hands on. It seems like they will
kill everyone who doesn't leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the NATO air attacks have accelerated the Serb forces'
efforts to drive Albanians from Kosovo, most refugees interviewed
said they supported the airstrikes, because they believed
Milosevic's ethnic cleansing campaign had been building for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is trying to save us. They had to act,'' said Besem.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the airstrikes had not triggered a spasm of new violence
he said, the only difference would have been that ``it would mean
those who are dead lived one month longer.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Western diplomat in Skopje, the Macedonian capital,
said he had heard from a source in Kosovo by cellular phone that
5,000 to 7,000 refugees were walking from Podujevo to Pristina, a
trek of about 20 miles.
</P>
<P>
   In Macedonia, the number of people crossing the border increased
dramatically Sunday after two days of trickling numbers. Border
guards estimated that at least 3,000 refugees crossed Sunday, most
of them going on to stay with family or friends in Skopje, the
Macedonian capital.
</P>
<P>
   Many refugees told similar tales of misery, of being confronted
in their homes at gunpoint by Serb troops and paramilitary police
who gave them five minutes to flee with the clothes on their backs
and whatever else they could grab. The refugees also said that Serb
forces demanded 100 deutsche marks to allow them to proceed on the
road that leads south from Pristina, the Kosovo capital, to the
border.
</P>
<P>
   Although Yugoslavia contends that the offensive being carried
out by some 40,000 Serb forces is aimed at crushing the rebels of
the Kosovo Liberation Army, many fleeing civilians reported being
driven from their homes at gunpoint, and some had seen neighbors
summarily executed. Few would give their names, saying they feared
retaliation, especially against family members still in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They killed people in my street,'' one man said. ``They were
cutting people's throats, shooting them.''
</P>
<P>
   The man, who said he was from Prizren in southwest Kosovo, drove
into Macedonia with his three children, wife and mother. He said
paramilitary police just 2 miles inside the border stopped him and
said they would shoot him if he didn't give them money to drive on.
He was angry that NATO had not followed up its bombing campaign by
sending troops into Kosovo to halt the killings and destruction of
Albanian villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shame on NATO,'' said the man, before driving off in anger
when a TV crew ignored his pleas not to photograph him.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian leaders Sunday were pleading for an aggressive step-up
in the NATO assault to incapacitate Milosevic's forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it is a worse situation,'' Ramajli said. ``But if NATO
had not bombed, this situation would have happened anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   President Meidani pleaded for an ``acceleration'' of NATO
action, including ground troops _ an option that NATO governments
have resisted because of the greater possibility of Western
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the United States and its President are as popular in
Albania as they are hated in non-Kosovar Serbia. City buses in
Tirana sported American flags.
</P>
<P>
   While Serbs held anti-American demonstrations in other
countries, 10,000 Albanians gathered in Skanderbeg Square in Tirana
to congratulate NATO. American flags unfurled alongside Albanian
flags, and signs said, ``Grateful to America,'' and ``Clinton:
Champion of Freedom.''

DOWNED US AIRCRAFT BECOMES SYMBOL OF DEFIANCE

<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia _ The Serbian government-controlled
television carried images of a downed and burning American Stealth
fighter nearly all day Sunday, making it a symbol of Serb defiance
against NATO's punishing airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds at a virulently anti-American street rally in this
city, the capital of the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, cheered
triumphantly when speakers mentioned the downed jet, which
overnight became a fulfillment of President Slobodan Milosevic's
nationalist prophecies of a holy war to defend the Serbs' beloved
province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was our victory. We showed to the whole world that we
will defend ourselves,'' said Zeljko Kanezevic, 20, amid the angry
chants of 800 demonstrators outside the American Cultural Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Serb feels Kosovo is its cradle. We will not give that
up at any price,'' he said, just after the crowd had pelted the
entrance to the building with rocks and bottles. It houses an
organization funded in part by the US Information Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the pro-Milosevic rally unfurled an enormous red
banner that draped down the front of the building, which featured
the Serbian Orthodox cross with a Cyrillic letter ``S'' in the four
corners of the crucifix. The letters stand for the nationalist
creed, ``Only unity saves Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You thought you were invincible, America, but you were wrong
about Serbians. We may not be able to defeat you, but we will never
give up our holy land without giving our blood to defend it,'' said
Jano Selevic, 22, at the rally. Although he has finished his
military service, he, like many young men here, said he is
volunteering to reenlist and fight.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo conflict has stewed in a cauldron of ethnic,
nationalist, and religious hatreds, and now it has boiled over.
Understanding its roots requires understanding what Kosovo means to
the Serbian national identity, for Kosovo is not only the ancestral
home of the Serbian people, it is their holy land. There are 500
monuments sacred to Christians across the rugged mountainous
terrain of Kosovo, which is roughly the size of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those roots, however, its population has changed
dramatically in the last 300 years. Ethnic Albanians began arriving
in Kosovo in large numbers in the 18th and 19th centuries. Before
the Serbs began their ``ethnic cleansing'' campaign, Kosovo was
nearly 90 percent ethnic Albanian. The Serbs, fueled by the Serbian
nationalist dreams of Milosevic, now seek to reclaim the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo is a holy place for the Serbs,'' said the Montenegrin
government's religion minister, Slobodan Tomovic. ``Just like
Jerusalem is for the Jews, Kosovo is their identity, and it is what
binds them together.''
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo's historical name is ``Kosovo Metojia,'' which roughly
translated means ``land of the church.'' Today, nationalists
commonly use the name ``Kosmet,'' combining the two words.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has played on these emotional religious ties to Kosovo
to build his nationalist political power base. His father was a
Christian theologian, but to advance his political career under
former Yugoslav Communist leader Josip Broz Tito, he downplayed his
religious background for decades.
</P>
<P>
   But when communism collapsed and many Serbs began returning to
the church, he resurrected his religious background.
</P>
<P>
   How well his political strategy succeeded is evident in the
offices of the newspaper ``Dan,'' a new voice of Milosevic's rising
Serbian nationalism. There, icons of Christian saints are hung
alongside portraits of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nationalism is religion and religion is nationalism,'' said
Vlado Ashanin, the newspaper's editor. ``Our history tells us that
the defense of our country is everything. It purifies our soul to
fight for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashanin, like almost all Serbian nationalists, even teenagers on
the street, harkens back to centuries of history to explain the
importance of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He cites the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, when Serbs valiantly but
futilely tried to defend Kosovo from the conquering Turks. The
battle is referred to as ``The Glorious Defeat,'' and many
nationalists make comparisons between that battle and NATO's
bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the same battle, just a new superpower,'' said Ashanin.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1989, on the 600th anniversary of the battle, that
Milosevic chose to launch the political platform that brought about
his ascendancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago,'' said Milka Tadic, managing editor of the
respected and independent news magazine Monitor, ``we signed a pact
with the devil, with Milosevic . . . and now we are paying the
price.''
</P>
<P>
   She pointed out that the United States initially supported
Milosevic and assisted his rise to power. ``The supporting of
Milosevic was a stupid illusion of the West,'' she said. ``I
believe in the goodwill of the US, but they look for quick
solutions. They don't understand the complexity. So their solutions
unravel, and then we are left with all the mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who came to worship at services in the 19th century
church of St. George Sunday, the mood was strikingly different from
that of the political rally, and several expressed indignation at
Milosevic's push to merge religion and nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Said Anna Provic, 23, a college student in economics, ``These
are just people who use religion to grab power. That is not true
faith. That is politics.''

<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
TAMPA, Fla. _ The introductions were made, the crowd cheered and
suddenly flashing across the middle of the floor was a muscular kid
who seemed to play the basketball like a yo-yo.
</P>
<P>
   Back and forth. Dribble here, bring it back. Around the world,
walk the dog, play the trapeze. Fake a pass, go through the legs,
go behind the back.
</P>
<P>
   He zipped a pass to a gangly looking 6-foot-11 stringbean who
you wouldn't guess had a single muscle in his body, until you saw
what happened next. The stringbean leaped high above the rim,
pumped his arms and softly tossed the ball off the backboard and
through the net.
</P>
<P>
   Next possession.
</P>
<P>
   The muscular kid strips the ball free from a pack of players and
zips back up the floor. This time, to his left is the stringbean
and running the wing to the right is a 6-7 youngster who looks like
a cross between French Lick, Ind., and Mayberry RFD.
</P>
<P>
   The kid has tousled hair and freckles, but a game that clearly
has been carefully groomed with hours of practice in a quiet gym
and long nights studying the great ones on videotape.
</P>
<P>
   He catches the pass, stops to read the defense, ball-fakes,
drives, steps back and pops a sweet jumper.
</P>
<P>
   The world said hello to Jason Williams, Casey Sanders and
Michael Dunleavy on Sunday in the Nike Hoop Summit all-star game
between America's best under-20 basketball talent and the best
players from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The world said hello to Duke's future. As if it really needs
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rich get richer,'' one sideline fan marveled during the
USA's 107-95 victory over the international stars at the Martinez
Center.
</P>
<P>
   But this is more than the rich simply getting richer. This is
Bill Gates winning the Powerball jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   How much is too much?
</P>
<P>
   As Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski sat with the nation's media Sunday
afternoon on the eve of today's national championship game with
Connecticut, he seemed almost embarrassed when he talked about this
Blue Devils team being one of the youngest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the ages of our guys,'' he said, ``they're
just kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Devils center and leading scorer Elton Brand is a
sophomore. Point guard William Avery is a sophomore. Forward Shane
Battier is a sophomore. Super-sub Corey Maggette is a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, of the eight regular contributors to Duke's 37-1 and
thus far overwhelmingly dominant season, seven are underclassmen.
The only senior is Trajan Langdon and the only other player likely
to depart after this season is Brand, the 1999 NCAA player of the
year and a certain NBA lottery pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have is depth,'' Krzyzewski said. ``We have some very
talented players and a lot of them can do a lot of things. There's
nobody who comes off the bench with a more talented player than
Maggette. There's just not.''
</P>
<P>
   As Krzyzewski spoke, across Tampa Bay at the Martinez Center
were Williams, Sanders and Dunleavy _ all three McDonald's All
Americans _ warming up for the elite international all-star game
and dreaming about just how much more dominant these Blue Devils
might get.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be great joining that team next year,'' Sanders
said. ``It's going to be a challenge. They're having a great year,
and we're going into a good situation. When a coach like
(Krzyzewski) offers you a scholarship to Duke, `no' isn't the first
thing that comes to your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   As dominant as the Blue Devils appear to be now, the prospects
only seem brighter for 2000, 2001 and beyond, which only four years
ago might have been hard to believe. After a 13-18 season in 1995,
the Blue Devils went 18-13 and tied for fourth in the ACC in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It was then when Krzyzewski re-evaluated his recruiting
strategies and placed more emphasis on getting to know players
earlier in their careers. He began emphasizing the early-signing
period for players and targeted only a handful of players every
year, rather than a dozen or more.
</P>
<P>
   The results were clear in the 1996 Nike Hoop Summit _ Brand,
Battier and Avery all played in that game.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Krzyzewski has stayed with his select few targets.
And won.
</P>
<P>
   In will come Williams, a 6-2 point guard from Plainfield, N.J.,
who many consider the best ball-handler and playmaker in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   In will come Sanders, a 6-11 forward and center who many compare
to San Antonio Spurs center David Robinson. Sanders is a late
bloomer who picked up basketball in the eighth grade. He is a
supreme shot-blocker, once rejecting 19 in a single game, runs the
floor well, defends and possesses a deadly jumper.
</P>
<P>
   In will come Dunleavy, the skilled son of Portland Trail Blazers
coach Mike Dunleavy, and a player whose skills are surpassed only
by his knowledge of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys we have here and those (recruits) are as good as
there's ever been at Duke,'' Krzyzewski said. ``We'll have to see
how it all works out, but it's a very promising group.''
</P>
<P>
   A promising future. As if Duke needs one.

STEALTH'S HOMETOWN DIVIDED ON US ROLE IN YUGOSLAVIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALAMOGORDO, N.M. _ In this town dominated by the US Air Force,
the people who work on base and off do not hesitate before claiming
the Stealth fighter pilot downed in Yugoslavia as one of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Along with 250 or so support troops deployed from Holloman Air
Force Base, he has their support and their prayers for a safe
return home.
</P>
<P>
   But Alamogordo's united front crumbles there.
</P>
<P>
   While some people are gung-ho about America's involvement in the
Balkans, others insist that the military personnel never should
have left home late last month. Even some retired officers say they
would rather the United States sit out the latest conflict to call
for Alamogordo's fighter planes and expertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We almost lost a member of the family, and for what?'' asked
Randy Highland, who recently retired as a technical sergeant after
20 years in the Air Force and seven Easters away from his own
family. ``I just don't think we should be sticking our neck out on
this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Added his wife, Donna Highland, a secretary at a local church,
``We're everybody's big brother. But we have nothing to do with
this fight.''
</P>
<P>
   But others disagreed just as adamantly with the idea of staying
put. Likening Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to Adolf
Hitler, a few all but demanded that the United States play a part
in ending the ethnic cleansing of Yugoslavia's ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say how far you should go, but there's always
going to be killing on both sides,'' said Hank Clovis, a retired
chief master sergeant who was passing through Alamogordo Sunday.
``If you save one life, you have to believe it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Six hours after his plane went down, the still-unidentified
pilot was rescued by a US military search-and-rescue team. But the
Air Force has not yet determined whether the American F-117 was
shot down by Serbian air defenses or malfunctioned, or whether
pilot error was responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Stealth continues to be the weapon of choice,'' Brigadier
General William J. Lake, commander of the 49th Fighter Wing, said
at a news conference held at the base. ``They're not invulnerable.
They're not invisible. They're by no means a cure-all or 100
percent inviolate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lake said the Air Force will rely primarily on the pilot to
determine what happened in the night sky, since the burned plane
cannot be recovered. He also said he is not overly concerned that
America's enemies will be able to copy the crashed Stealth's unique
makeup. ``I'm not sure anyone can do a lot with a pile of rubble,''
he said. ``I hope not.''
</P>
<P>
   In Alamogordo, eight miles from the Holloman base, air mishaps
are understood. The base has been here in the shadow of the
Sacramento Mountains since 1942. The Stealth, also known as the
F-117A Nighthawk, was built in secret and moved to Holloman in the
summer of 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone remembers when one of the jets crashed that
August, a crash attributed in part to pilot error and in part to an
inexperienced maintenance crew. Of the 54 original jets, 50 remain,
including the 11 now left to fly out of the base in Aviano, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many people eating at the fast-food and family-style
restaurants along the town's main strip say they were stunned to
hear that one of the planes in the ``Black Sheep'' squadron was
downed. After their success in Operation Desert Storm, when none of
the planes were even nicked, they describe themselves as feeling
almost invincible. Saturday's crash was the first time the Air
Force lost a Stealth fighter in combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time a guy goes up, you know there's that chance,'' said
Marc Murray, a manager at the base research lab. ``After the Gulf
War, I guess we felt like no one could touch us.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Murray says America has to be involved in this fight. So
does Scott Newton, a US Border Patrol employee who calls it the
moral position to take. But others say the conflict has been going
on too long _ and will go on long after the United States pulls out
_ to risk the life of even one young man or woman from Alamogordo,
especially without the commitment of ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``By us being there, we're only making them more hostile,'' said
Paul Jackson, a building contractor who has a son in the Army.
``Why can't the US stay out of it and let Great Britain handle it
and let someone else take the fall? They're not going to solve
anything there.''

US EMBASSY IN MOSCOW COMES UNDER ATTACK
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian police and masked gunmen exchanged fire outside
the US Embassy Sunday after assailants tried to fire a grenade
launcher at the building, scattering hundreds of demonstrators
protesting NATO's airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   No one was hurt, but the daytime attack on a busy street
highlighted the way virulent anti-American sentiment in Moscow has
spilled out in the open since the US-led alliance began bombing
Yugoslavia last week.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO airstrikes have drawn bitter attacks from the Kremlin,
the Russian media, and politicians from liberals to hardline
Communists and nationalists. The US Embassy has become the
epicenter of raucous daily protests.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's gun battle ensued when a man in camouflage and a ski
mask and brandishing a hand-held grenade launcher stepped out of a
white jeep parked across the busy road in front of the embassy.
Dramatic footage replayed on Russian television showed the
assailant attempt to fire the weapon. Police standing guard at the
demonstration saw the gunman and opened fire. The gunman dropped
the weapon and jumped in the vehicle, and someone in the jeep
returned fire with a machine gun as the vehicle raced away.
</P>
<P>
   The jeep was later found, but the assailants got away. Russia's
interior minister ordered security around embassies stepped up. The
protests outside the embassy resumed after Sunday's gunfight behind
a phalanx of riot troops in flak jackets and helmets.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's attack bore similarities to a 1995 incident in which
the embassy was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, during protests
over NATO bombings of Serb forces in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Relations have soured again since last year's economic collapse
in Russia, this time accompanied by growing resentment of the
United States by ordinary Russians, who blame US-sponsored reforms
for their economic troubles. For many Russians, the NATO attack was
the final straw.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you say of a country that bombs innocent people with
no regard for that law?'' cried a protester who gave only his first
name, Albert. ``We have tried the American way in Russia for seven
years, and we reject it.''
</P>
<P>
   With parliamentary elections coming up in December,
anti-Americanism is likely to be a popular campaign theme.
Government leaders have said they want to avoid actions that would
lead to open confrontation with the West, especially as Moscow
seeks loans to see it through the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said the incident
``throws a shadow on Russia, which is currently undertaking titanic
efforts to solve the crisis around Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Reuters quoted a US official in Washington as saying Russian
authorities were cooperating in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign of the increasingly ugly mood toward America, two
leading Russian politicians characterized the attack as a
legitimate response to NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is normal. Many people are filling with hatred toward
Americans,'' ultranationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky told NTV
television. He said the US Embassy qualified as ``an enemy
installation'' and predicted further violence.
</P>
<P>
   Gennady Zyuganov, head of Russia's Communist Party, said NATO's
airstrikes amounted to ``state terrorism'' and that under such
circumstances, ``partisan tactics'' were to be expected.
</P>
<P>
   Both Zhirinovsky's party and the Communists have called for
Russia to send arms and volunteer soldiers to Yugoslavia to aid the
Serbs, Orthodox Christian Slavs like many the majority of Russia's
population.
</P>
<P>
   Russian volunteers interviewed last week said that by helping
Yugoslavia fight off NATO, they would be defending Russia from
further advances by the Western alliance.

NATO SHIFTS FOCUS, TARGETS RAMPAGING SERBS IN KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO warplanes unleashed the fiercest strike yet
against Serb ground forces in Kosovo Sunday, as US and allied
officials warned that marauding Serb military units have launched a
full-scale campaign of murder and intimidation to drive ethnic
Albanian civilians from the separatist province.
</P>
<P>
   Amid growing concern that much of the Balkan region could be
destabilized by the Kosovo conflict, the United States and Britain
boosted their commitment of air power to combat what President
Clinton called a Serbian campaign of ``inhumane violence.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said they are rapidly shifting the mission's
focus from hammering Yugoslavia's nationwide air defense system to
pounding Serb forces in Kosovo in a ``race against time'' to spare
ethnic Albanian civilians from further atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO assault in Kosovo heightens the risk to allied pilots,
the day after an American Stealth fighter-bomber went down near the
Yugoslav capital of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   After a daring rescue, the unidentified pilot was reported to be
in good condition Sunday at Aviano air base in Italy and helping
authorities determine the cause of the crash. There were
indications the jet was shot down by a surface-to-air missile, and
General Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
Yugoslavia's air defense system remains potent enough to be ``very
dangerous'' to NATO pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and allied officials said NATO would not be deterred
despite the potential for additional losses or the images Sunday of
Serbs dancing joyfully on the wreckage of the American aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to recognize that we are on the brink of a major
humanitarian disaster in Kosovo, the likes of which have not been
seen in Europe since the closing stages of World War II,'' NATO
spokesman Jamie Shea said at a news conference in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Clinton said, ``The continued brutality and
repression of the Serb forces further underscores the need for NATO
to persevere.''
</P>
<P>
   As the humanitarian situation in Kosovo deteriorated, NATO
officials said Serb troops, police and armed gangs loyal to
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic have accelerated their
``scorched earth policy'' of ``ethnic cleansing'' since the NATO
operation began last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb brutality against ethnic Albanians has included the
murders of 20 teachers, a prominent lawyer and his sons, and an
unspecified number of trade unionists, according to NATO reports.
Ethnic Albanians, who account for 90 percent of the 2 million
residents of the Serbian province of Kosovo, are being used as
human shields by Serb forces, according to NATO reports.
</P>
<P>
   The growing violence has stunned many allied leaders who
expected the massive NATO airstrikes to curb the alleged war
crimes. But Clinton said he saw no link between the NATO mission
and the increased brutality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' he said, when a reporter asked if the allied
bombing is ``driving the atrocities.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the mayhem, refugees continued to flee Kosovo by the tens
of thousands, flooding into struggling countries that are
ill-equipped to handle them. With an estimated 500,000 ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo already driven from their homes, authorities in
neighboring Albania and Macedonia appealed for international aid to
prevent a humanitarian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian officials also joined the Kosovo Liberation Army in
calling for NATO to send groups to battle the Serb forces, a
proposal that NATO has studied and so far rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton said NATO has determined that waging an infantry
offensive against the Serbs ``would involve hundreds of thousands
of ground troops over a rather protracted period of time and in a
very dangerous situation. So there is no political agreement to do
that short of a peace settlement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several US senators said Sunday on network news shows that they
expect the NATO bombing to continue for at least several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   As a fifth straight night of bombing began, the Pentagon
announced it will add as many as 12 more planes, including
long-range bombers, to the 200 American aircraft participating in
NATO's first offensive operation in its 50-year history. Britain
said it will increase its contribution from eight to 20 warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Serb military aircraft have flown ``each day in the areas of
ethnic cleansing'' in Kosovo, Air Commodore David Wilby told
reporters at NATO headquarters. But Wilby said NATO's new focus on
the Serb operations in Kosovo will alter the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Allied forces flew 253 sorties Saturday night and early Sunday
in the fourth round of bombing, striking 17 targets throughout
Yugoslavia, including military and police headquarters in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night and early Monday, the bombing mission was
supplemented by missile fired by B-52 bombers. The Kosovo
Liberation Army's news agency said NATO aircraft attacked a
Yugoslav army column in central Kosovo and destroyed four tanks.
There also were reports of NATO forces hitting an airport in the
Serbian city of Nis and of a huge explosion near the Kosovo border
with Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict continued to provoke demonstrations and violent
protests around the world, including a daylight assault on the US
Embassy in Moscow by men firing assault weapons and grenade
launchers. The assailants were driven away by police, and no
injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators also burned American flags and lobbed pieces of
concerete at the US consulate in Sydney, Australia. Riot police
used tear gas to disperse a similar demonstration in front of the
US Embassy in Paris. Other protests occurred across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav leaders, in separate interviews on Russian and American
TV, denied committing genocide against ethnic Albanians. They also
accused NATO of wrongfully helping ethnic Albanians seek autonomy
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO mission is aimed at focing Milosevic to accept a peace
settlement that would grant Kosovo autonomy. The agreement ``has
been accepted by the Kosovo Albanian community,'' said Shea, the
NATO spokesman, ``and I hope the people who signed it are still
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials rejected the denials of ethnic cleansing.
``This bloodbath has been carried out by Milosevic over a period of
years,'' said Defense Secretary William S. Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the few, small signs of hope for a truce in the
conflict, three Russian politicians met with US envoy Richard
Holbrooke in Hungary Sunday on their way to a possible meeting in
Belgrade with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin, who has expressed outrage at
NATO's military intervention, has said he wants to mediate an end
to the showdown.

BASEBALL DIPLOMACY BRINGS MAJOR LEAGUERS TO CUBA
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ It was only batting practice, but the nearly 50,000
fans who packed Estadio Latinoamericano Sunday were already on
their feet, cheering Baltimore Orioles slugger Albert Belle, who
had slammed three straight balls over the right field fence and
into the bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this crowd,'' said Orioles pitcher Sidney Ponson.
``This is Latin America. They know, and we know, that this is a
historic game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Major Leagues returned to this baseball-crazed country for
the first time in 40 years Sunday as the Orioles defeated the Cuban
all-star team 3-2 in 11 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Although the game was just an exhibition, for many Cuban players
and fans, it carried all the weight of a seventh game of the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about this even though I'm very disappointed that
we lost,'' said Omar Linares, the Cuban third baseman who is widely
described as the country's best ballplayer. ``This has been a very
emotional experience for me. I hope we can do something like this
every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban President Fidel Castro, who calls himself the country's
greatest baseball fan, was also in attendance. Before the game, he
strode across the diamond to greet the players as the crowd chanted
``Fi-del.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing beneath large outfield signs that proclaimed baseball
as ``Cuba's Socialist Sport,'' the two teams stood in a line next
to their respective flags.
</P>
<P>
   Castro stood for both the Cuban and American national anthems
and watched the game from a front-row seat, next to baseball
Commissioner Bud Selig and Orioles owner Peter Angelos.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an absolute fan of the game,'' Angelos said after the
game, adding that the communist leader asked many questions about
professional baseball, including one about players' salaries.
</P>
<P>
   All of the tickets for the game were issued by invitation only,
a sore point for many passionate fans who had to follow the game on
television or radio. The handpicked crowd was also more polite and
subdued than those who who came to the stadium Friday and Saturday
to see the national playoffs between Havana and its archrival
Santiago. Gone, for the most part, were the hecklers, the music,
and hip-shaking dances that often go nonstop from the first inning
to the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't feel the same as it usually does,'' said Maria
Carmen Romero, who sat along the first-base line with her husband
and 12-year-old son. ``We might be more animated if we were
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were moments when the crowd erupted in
eardrum-piercing joy, like the time Linares slapped a line drive
that scored the tying run in the bottom of the eighth inning, or
when the Cuban team appeared poised to win in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles sealed the victory in the top of the 11th, when
designated hitter Harold Baines smacked an RBI single into right
field, scoring first baseman Will Clark.
</P>
<P>
   For many older Cuban fans, Sunday's game brought back memories
of the days when this tropical city was home to the Triple-A Havana
Sugar Kings, and when major league teams regularly held spring
training exhibitions here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a knife in my soul when they stopped playing
here,'' said Juan Carlos Posadas, a 66-year-old mechanic. ``I've
waiting a long time to see something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The last professional game played in Cuba was in March 1959,
when the Los Angeles Dodgers, led by eight strikeouts by Sandy
Koufax, beat the Cincinnati Reds 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   But the Castro-inspired Communist revolution that same year, and
the US economic embargo that followed, ended those baseball ties.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game, as well as a second game May 3 at Baltimore's
Camden Yards, were made possible when President Clinton relaxed
some of the restrictions in January.
</P>
<P>
   Orioles owner Angelos said that despite the criticism he has
received, mostly from Cuban-Americans, for his decison to play in
Cuba, he was confident other teams would follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that what we've begun here will grow for other teams,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although that prospect is less than certain, Juan Antonio Reyes
thinks it would benefit both countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the hitters and we have the pitchers and fielders,''
said Reyes, 29. ``We have much to teach each other about
baseball.''

TERRY LABONTE RETURNS TO TEXAS FOR VICTORY (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
FORT WORTH, Texas _ When Terry Labonte returned to his home state
for a NASCAR Winston Cup test earlier this month, he was a typical
Texan.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You can always tell the people from Texas,'' Labonte said
yesterday, ``because they'll tell you they're from Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   That was not the case on March 8-9 at Texas Motor Speedway,
where Labonte was the strong and sullen type during one of his
NASCAR-alloted two-day tests. And with good reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't feel like we had a very good test here,'' said
Labonte, referring to himself and crew chief Andy Graves. As the
session deteriorated because of a series of engine and chassis
problems, Labonte nervously paced the vacant garage area. He
dismissed all interview requests with a cold stare. Then he and
Graves went back to their shop at Hendrick Motorsports in North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``We joked about it, testing as bad as we did, we were going to
go back and win the race,'' Labonte said.
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a true Texan.
</P>
<P>
   And as of yesterday afternoon, the winner of the third Winston
Cup race at TMS. Strapped into a vintage 1996 version of his No. 5
Kellogg's Chevrolet _ a Monte Carlo resurrected after that lousy
test _ Labonte reeled in and ran down Dale Jarrett to win the
Primestar 500.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett and Labonte thrilled a TMS-record crowd of 221,861 over
the final 47 of 334 laps around the revamped 1.5-mile quadoval.
Jarrett had the point from Lap 285 to Lap 322, when Labonte ran him
down exiting Turn 4. Running to the outside of Jarrett down the
front stretch, Labonte completed the pass at the start/finish line,
then tucked in front of Jarrett as the lapped car of Chad Little
loomed ahead.
</P>
<P>
   With the crowd up and cheering, Labonte had stretched his lead
to eight car lengths when Jimmy Spencer's crash into the
front-stretch wall brought out the day's final caution flag on Lap
332.
</P>
<P>
   That gave Labonte three laps to strut before the home folk,
acknowledge congratulations from Jarrett and brother and
third-place finisher Bobby Labonte _ and reflect upon the ironies
that had produced his 21st career victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we went home and thought about it, Andy suggested we
bring this other car back,'' said Labonte, whose most recent
victory had been in Richmond, Va., on June 6. That was 26 races
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the car that won Charlotte in 1996, and propelled us to
the championship.'' said Graves, referring to Labonte's most recent
Cup title season. ``We tore it up in Michigan in 1997 and never got
it back to where it was comfortable. Terry and I decided last week
to bring it. We felt we had a couple of other good cars, but this
was the best one.''
</P>
<P>
   This car was good enough for Labonte to lead five times for a
race-high 124 laps, including the final 12. Labonte began to fill
up Jarrett's rearview mirror on Lap 320, when he drew to within one
car length through turns 1 and 2. Labonte put a yellow quarter
panel on the outside of Jarrett's car exiting Turn 2 on Lap 320 and
snuck a little bit more of Chevy fender there on Lap 321. Those
moves convinced Labonte there was enough of a second groove worked
up high that he could take Jarrett on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought I was going to pass him in Turn 2 on the
outside,'' said Labonte, who led the most laps for the first time
in 1999. ``I was up to his quarter panel, and I was hoping his
spotter was going to say, `There's somebody on your outside.' I
could tell he didn't see me, so I had to get out of the gas and try
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte did so exiting the revamped Turn 4. The pass was
executed high and along the wall, placing Labonte ahead of Jarrett
and below Little. And just in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were running out of laps,'' said Labonte, who has three
top-10 finishes in the Cup races at TMS. ``And it's always easier
when you're in second place and running in traffic and you can see
what's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett had played his hand on Lap 276, when he pitted for four
tires and fuel and gambled on winning the race via track position.
But he could not account for late-race lapped traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I could go on my fresh tires, I had some lapped cars that
wanted to go, too,'' said Jarrett, driver of the No. 88 Quality
Care/Ford Credit Taurus. ``So I couldn't stretch out my lead like I
wanted to. But I still thought that maybe if I could use up enough
racetrack I could keep Terry behind me. As I caught one of them in
\Rturns\S 3 and 4, my car pushed up as I tried to get back in the
throttle, and that hurt me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry just got up high and got a run to the outside, and there
was nothing I could do after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially after the final caution flew, and Jarrett became the
first car in Labonte's extended victory parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the crowd and they were all standing and cheering,''
Labonte said. ``All the other drivers pulled up beside me and
congratulated me. That's a good feeling. To me, this is the biggest
race I've ever won, to come down here to Texas and win.''

NATO WARPLANES BROADED ATTACK; US VOWS TO PERSEVERE WITHOUT GROUND
TROOPS
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
By JOHN C. HENRY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WASHINGTON _ NATO dispatched more firepower Sunday against Serb
military units, a new phase in the air attacks that allied
officials said is spurred by reports of stepped-up atrocities
against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As the air assault entered a fifth day, the Clinton
administration again said there were no plans to use ground troops
in Kosovo and rejected calls to arm the Kosovo Liberation Army to
fend off the Yugoslav army, options some senators urged the
president to leave open.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees, recounting
scenes of Serb brutality, fled into neighboring Albania and
Macedonia, prompting officials to plead for international help to
avert a humanitarian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said there are as
many as 18,000 Serb troops now massing an offensive against the
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, the southernmost province of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are terrible reports about ... men being separated from
women and children, then they're being taken off and executed,
villages being torched, people arriving across the border with no
shoes, and literally told to leave their villages,'' Albright said
on CBS' Face the Nation.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, President Clinton said the NATO bombing
would continue until Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ends the
``inhumane violence'' in Kosovo. Following a meeting with his
national security team, Clinton told reporters ``the continued
brutality and repression of the Serb forces further underscores the
need for NATO to persevere.''
</P>
<P>
   As he headed toward Marine One for a flight to Camp David, the
president was asked if the air attacks might have prompted
Milosevic to step up the brutality in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' Clinton snapped.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of whether the bombing might be driving the ethnic
brutality was raised earlier with Albright, who dismissed the
assertion. ``That is just simply an upside down argument to think
that NATO or we have made this get worse,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic is the one that is to blame,'' Albright said. ``He
is the one that is making it worse and what we were trying to do is
to make sure that he pays the heaviest price for what he is
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if an air assault alone could cripple the paramilitary
units involved in the atrocities, Albright and Defense Secretary
William Cohen repeated Clinton's position that he has no intention
of sending ground troops to Kosovo unless the Serbs agree to the
peace deal already signed by ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a peace settlement, then he has indicated we'd be
prepared to contribute a small amount of a peace-keeping force, of
the total, but absent that, we're going to continue with the air
campaign,'' Cohen said on NBC's Meet the Press.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
on CNN that it would take ``hundreds of thousands of ground troops
over a rather protracted period of time and in a very dangerous
situation'' to invade Yugoslavia and forcefully stop the Serb
repression of the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., who chairs the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said he has never heard of a war ``that's been won
totally by air power.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam,
said the United States has ``to exercise every option'' once it
gets into armed conflict. ``We have to do whatever it takes,'' said
McCain, a possible GOP presidential candidate. ``All of us would
grieve at the loss of a single American. But when you go into these
things the primary purpose cannot be the safety of your forces, it
has to be the achievement of your strategic and tactical goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., agreed that airstrikes alone
will not stop the genocide but said fighting on the ground should
be left to ethnic Albanians, who should be supplied with arms by
the U.S. and its NATO partners. ``Clearly you can't stop the kind
of slaughter and terrorism on the ground without some contradictory
opposing force on the ground,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and NATO officials ruled out involvement in any ground war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue this campaign as long as it is necessary,
until the job is finished,'' said Sandy Berger, the president's
national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon late Sunday said that the United States, which
already has about 200 warplanes in Operation Allied Force, would be
assigning between six and 12 more aircraft _ including some B-52
long-range bombers _ to aid in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   As Sunday's bombing began under overcast skies, officials at the
Pentagon and NATO headquarters in Brussels declined to discuss
details from the downing Saturday of the Air Force F-117A stealth
fighter-bomber near the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press quoted an unnamed defense official as
saying there were strong indications the F-117 was hit by a
surface-to-air missile. The official said there was no reported
mechanical problem with the aircraft but an explosion was heard.
</P>
<P>
   Officials declined to name the U.S. pilot or to provide
information from Saturday night's six-hour mission to rescue him
from behind enemy lines. Officials said the pilot was in good
condition at Aviano Air Base in Italy and helping Air Force
investigators determine what disabled his aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's air attacks by U.S. and NATO aircraft broadened to
target Serb forces blamed for the atrocities, raised the risk to
NATO pilots but also increased the chance for slowing Yugoslavia's
ground offensive against the insurgent Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at an expanded set of targets and we're going to
go more intensively after some targets,'' said NATO Commander Gen.
Wesley Clark, a U.S. Army general.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO airstrikes were launched Wednesday after Milosevic, a
Serbian nationalist who presides over the Yugoslav republic,
refused to enter into a peace agreement with the majority ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, the largest Serb province. Serbia is the main
republic in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, U.N. officials report more than 500,000 ethnic
Albanians, about one-fourth of Kosovo's population, have been
driven from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Independent verification of information coming from Kosovo _ or
from other regions of Yugoslavia _ has become impossible in the
past week since foreign journalists have not been allowed into the
province.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia denied claims that paramilitary units under the
direction of Milosevic were committing genocide or ``ethnic
cleansing'' operations against ethnic Albanians who, before the
exodus, made up 90 percent of the population of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the unity of the 19-nation NATO alliance appeared to
soften Sunday as Portugal joined Italy and Greece in calling for an
early resumption of talks with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said his country had
``always been supportive of our allies and we understand the need
to intervene to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe.'' At the same
time, he said, ``any window of opportunity'' to restart talks on
the future of Kosovo should be seized.

   Dear Diary:

<P>
   My wife, Brooke Hayward, and I were en route to see ``Death of a
Salesman.'' The curb in front of the O'Neill Theater was jammed
with cars disgorging passengers, so our cab pulled up to the
opposite curb. Walking across, we paused to allow an elderly
hot-dog vendor, who was pushing one cart and pulling another, to
get by. The vendor looked at the theater, then looked at us and
said, ``Hey, I hear that's a pretty good show.''
</P>
<P>
   We picked up our tickets and stopped next door to have a
pretheater drink. There was the playwright, Arthur Miller. We told
him about the comment made by that other kind of salesman, the
hot-dog vendor. ``That's the greatest review,'' Miller said.

   Dear Diary:

<P>
   I was sitting near the front of a bus, listening to a rather
loud conversation somewhere behind me. The woman was talking about
her day, the man about his.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that I was witness to a typical interchange in the
life of a ``Me Generation'' couple, I heard her tell how hard it
had been to find just the right fabric for the curtains she needed
to order. He, on the other hand, without seeming to hear a word she
said, went on and on about a real-estate deal he had tried to close
that day.
</P>
<P>
   I did not realize how wrong my assumption was until I saw the
woman pass me on her way off the bus, holding her cell phone at her
ear, still talking about her fabric. The man, still seated
somewhere behind me, was obviously on his cell phone, still talking
about his real-estate deal. I guess ``Cell Phone Age'' has replaced
the ``Me Generation.''

   Maurice Finnell was waiting for a friend in the East '60s when
he heard a driver honking his horn, obviously agitated because he
was hemmed in by another vehicle, double parked.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle displayed a large cross inside the windshield, so
Finnell suggested that the driver ask the doormen nearby whether a
member of the clergy was visiting their building, perhaps on an
errand of mercy. The driver did so, with no success. He was
becoming increasingly frustrated and explained that he had an
important interview.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly a priest turned the corner and headed toward the two
men. The driver rushed toward him, angrily criticizing his lack of
consideration, especially given his profession. The priest
patiently heard him out and then quietly said: ``Son, I know
exactly how you feel, as would I, but this isn't my automobile.
Would you, however, allow me to assume that motorist's blame?''
</P>
<P>
   Finnell couldn't wait around to find out what happened when the
real culprit appeared to claim his car.

   I live in Chicago, but travel to New York frequently on business
and have established many routines. For several years, I've had the
same man cut my hair, and we often joke about how tourists in New
York are easily identified by their ``anything goes'' approach to
dressing.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Saturday, I took an early flight to accommodate my
boxing workout session and haircut before lunch. I arrived during a
downpour, had the taxi wait as I dropped my bags at my hotel and
raced downtown for my gym session. Then I took the subway uptown to
my hair appointment. Completely drenched, I arrived at the salon
wearing my workout clothes and carrying my gym bag and boxing
gloves.
</P>
<P>
   My stylist looked at me and smiled. ``The quality of tourist in
New York has really gone downhill,'' he said.

grandfather straightened the line and the boy said, ``You're the
smartest grandfather in the whole world _ how did you get to be so
smart?''
</P>

   The grandfather, knowing the boy's dislike of a certain

   A bicycle approached carrying an older woman in a gray sweat
suit. On her head was a straw hat, complete with a big red rose. A

Mrs. Honea read the sign hanging off the bed roll. It said: HATTIE

named what he called a ``delightful'' place but said that they
would need a taxi to get there. A cab was hailed and the man got in
with the couple. When they arrived at the restaurant, they thanked
him for going out of his way to help them.

TERRY LABONTE RETURNS TO TEXAS FOR VICTORY FIXES GARBLE IN LEDE
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
FORT WORTH, Texas _ When Terry Labonte returned to his home state
for a NASCAR Winston Cup test earlier this month, he was an
atypical Texan.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You can always tell the people from Texas,'' Labonte said
yesterday, ``because they'll tell you they're from Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   That was not the case on March 8-9 at Texas Motor Speedway,
where Labonte was the strong and sullen type during one of his
NASCAR-alloted two-day tests. And with good reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't feel like we had a very good test here,'' said
Labonte, referring to himself and crew chief Andy Graves. As the
session deteriorated because of a series of engine and chassis
problems, Labonte nervously paced the vacant garage area. He
dismissed all interview requests with a cold stare. Then he and
Graves went back to their shop at Hendrick Motorsports in North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``We joked about it, testing as bad as we did, we were going to
go back and win the race,'' Labonte said.
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a true Texan.
</P>
<P>
   And as of yesterday afternoon, the winner of the third Winston
Cup race at TMS. Strapped into a vintage 1996 version of his No. 5
Kellogg's Chevrolet _ a Monte Carlo resurrected after that lousy
test _ Labonte reeled in and ran down Dale Jarrett to win the
Primestar 500.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett and Labonte thrilled a TMS-record crowd of 221,861 over
the final 47 of 334 laps around the revamped 1.5-mile quadoval.
Jarrett had the point from Lap 285 to Lap 322, when Labonte ran him
down exiting Turn 4. Running to the outside of Jarrett down the
front stretch, Labonte completed the pass at the start/finish line,
then tucked in front of Jarrett as the lapped car of Chad Little
loomed ahead.
</P>
<P>
   With the crowd up and cheering, Labonte had stretched his lead
to eight car lengths when Jimmy Spencer's crash into the
front-stretch wall brought out the day's final caution flag on Lap
332.
</P>
<P>
   That gave Labonte three laps to strut before the home folk,
acknowledge congratulations from Jarrett and brother and
third-place finisher Bobby Labonte _ and reflect upon the ironies
that had produced his 21st career victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we went home and thought about it, Andy suggested we
bring this other car back,'' said Labonte, whose most recent
victory had been in Richmond, Va., on June 6. That was 26 races
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the car that won Charlotte in 1996, and propelled us to
the championship.'' said Graves, referring to Labonte's most recent
Cup title season. ``We tore it up in Michigan in 1997 and never got
it back to where it was comfortable. Terry and I decided last week
to bring it. We felt we had a couple of other good cars, but this
was the best one.''
</P>
<P>
   This car was good enough for Labonte to lead five times for a
race-high 124 laps, including the final 12. Labonte began to fill
up Jarrett's rearview mirror on Lap 320, when he drew to within one
car length through turns 1 and 2. Labonte put a yellow quarter
panel on the outside of Jarrett's car exiting Turn 2 on Lap 320 and
snuck a little bit more of Chevy fender there on Lap 321. Those
moves convinced Labonte there was enough of a second groove worked
up high that he could take Jarrett on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought I was going to pass him in Turn 2 on the
outside,'' said Labonte, who led the most laps for the first time
in 1999. ``I was up to his quarter panel, and I was hoping his
spotter was going to say, `There's somebody on your outside.' I
could tell he didn't see me, so I had to get out of the gas and try
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte did so exiting the revamped Turn 4. The pass was
executed high and along the wall, placing Labonte ahead of Jarrett
and below Little. And just in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were running out of laps,'' said Labonte, who has three
top-10 finishes in the Cup races at TMS. ``And it's always easier
when you're in second place and running in traffic and you can see
what's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett had played his hand on Lap 276, when he pitted for four
tires and fuel and gambled on winning the race via track position.
But he could not account for late-race lapped traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I could go on my fresh tires, I had some lapped cars that
wanted to go, too,'' said Jarrett, driver of the No. 88 Quality
Care/Ford Credit Taurus. ``So I couldn't stretch out my lead like I
wanted to. But I still thought that maybe if I could use up enough
racetrack I could keep Terry behind me. As I caught one of them in
\Rturns\S 3 and 4, my car pushed up as I tried to get back in the
throttle, and that hurt me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry just got up high and got a run to the outside, and there
was nothing I could do after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially after the final caution flew, and Jarrett became the
first car in Labonte's extended victory parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the crowd and they were all standing and cheering,''
Labonte said. ``All the other drivers pulled up beside me and
congratulated me. That's a good feeling. To me, this is the biggest
race I've ever won, to come down here to Texas and win.''

PROTESTS MAY DISRUPT LOUIMA TRIAL, LAWYERS SAY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Daily demonstrations planned for outside the Brooklyn
court where jury selection is to begin Monday in the trial of four
police officers charged with brutalizing Abner Louima could
increase the chance that the trial will be delayed or moved out of
New York City, lawyers for two of the officers said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said that the demonstrations, which are planned to
begin during the jury selection process, would make impaneling a
fair and impartial jury for the highly controversial case even more
difficult than expected.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers, Joseph Tacopina and Marvyn Kornberg, said that
although U.S. District Judge Eugene Nickerson denied defense
requests last month for a postponement of the trial or a change of
venue, he also said he would reconsider his ruling if the jury
selection process showed that an impartial jury could not be found.
</P>
<P>
   The requests had been made on the ground that intensive news
coverage of the Louima case and of the recent police killing of
Amadou Diallo in the Bronx had created widespread anti-police
feeling.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rev. Al Sharpton, who is planning the demonstrations,
maintained that they would not affect the prospects of impaneling a
jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fact that you have vigils or demonstrations does
not mean you can't get a fair and impartial jury,'' Sharpton said
Sunday. He added that similar demonstrations he had organized at
other high-profile trials in racially charged cases in New York had
not prevented the impaneling of juries.
</P>
<P>
   Among the trials he cited were the 1987 Queens trial of white
teen-agers stemming from the attack on three black men in Howard
Beach, one of whom, Michael Griffith, was struck and killed by a
car when chased onto the Belt Parkway, and the 1990 Brooklyn trial
of young whites in the fatal shooting of a black youth, Yusuf
Hawkins, in Bensonhurst. Three of the four defendants in the Queens
trial and both in the Brooklyn trial were convicted of various
charges.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Louima, a Haitian immigrant who is black, the
four officers accused of attacking him are white.
</P>
<P>
   All four _ Justin Volpe, Charles Schwarz, Thomas Wiese and
Thomas Bruder _ are accused of beating him in a police car after he
was arrested in a street brawl in Flatbush in August 1997. And
prosecutors from the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn say that
later, at the 70th Precinct station house, Volpe rammed a stick
into Louima's mouth and rectum, causing severe injuries to his
rectum and bladder, while Schwarz held him down. The officers say
the charges are untrue.
</P>
<P>
   Wiese's lawyer, Tacopina, said that the planned demonstrations
would ``definitely have an effect'' on jury selection and enhance
the possibility of a venue change or a delay. Speaking of
prospective jurors _ as many as 600 are to arrive at the courthouse
Monday to fill out questionnaires _ Tacopina said they could react
to the demonstrations with ``fear and emotion that may cause them
to want not to sit on the jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the last highly publicized trial in which he defended
a police officer in the same courthouse, the so-called Morgue Boys
trial in 1995 in which three officers were acquitted of charges
that they systematically robbed Brooklyn residents and drug
dealers, there were no demonstrators. ``We had a jury free to
render a decision without the hindrance of outside taint,''
Tacopina said.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe's lawyer, Kornberg, said, ``There's no doubt in my mind
the demonstrations will have an effect on jury selection.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said the demonstrations would involve things like
prayer sessions, but not the sort of civil disobedience actions
like the protests he organized in the Diallo case that have led to
more than 1,000 arrests at police headquarters.

POLITICAL MEMO: PROTEST REBUILDING SHARPTON'S IMAGE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Barely a year ago, the Rev. Al Sharpton was viewed in
many quarters as a fading presence, permanently compromised by his
association with Tawana Brawley's discredited story of abduction
and rape. He was on the verge of becoming a caricature of the
disaffected New York protester, shunned by establishment
politicians both white and black.
</P>
<P>
   But in the space of two weeks or so, he has risen yet again,
becoming more influential and prominent than ever before in his
sometimes troubled political career. It is vivid testimony both to
his political resourcefulness and to the way the Amadou Diallo
killing has reshaped the political debate in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The same tragedy that has created the biggest crisis of Rudolph
Giuliani's mayoralty has allowed Sharpton, one of the mayor's most
persistent critics, to step from the margins to the mainstream,
achieving a credibility that would have seemed improbable six
months ago. A broad range of prominent New Yorkers, many of whom
have shunned him in the past, have appeared at his side on the
arrest line at Police Headquarters, praising his efforts in
orchestrating the public response.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence of this mounts each day. As Sharpton was driven to
a police demonstration last week, he took phone calls from Rep.
Eliot Engel of the Bronx, state Senator David Paterson of Harlem
and David Dinkins, the former Mayor, all Democrats seeking his
counsel. Sharpton arrived at 1 Police Plaza to lead a group of 100
chanting rabbis and rabbinical students down the sidewalk to their
arrest. ``Shalom, shalom, shalom!'' Sharpton shouted as his new
friends slipped past the barricades.
</P>
<P>
   He has done what no Democratic candidate has accomplished since
Giuliani, a Republican, came to power. He has assembled the
remnants of the city's once-dominant liberal Democratic coalition
and built upon that foundation. In this, he has enlisted some of
his strongest critics, among them former Mayor Edward Koch, as well
as the older and more orderly generation of black leadership, like
Dinkins and Rep. Charles Rangel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the catalyst,'' said the Rev. Floyd Flake, a former
Democratic congressman and one of the mayor's most prominent
supporters. ``He just stepped in and began the process of trying to
move the agenda, as he does in all these cases. I like to tell
people this is his career. When you look at this situation in
relation to Los Angeles and Rodney King, regardless of what anybody
says about him, his presence and his finding a way to give people a
means to vent probably saved this city from having the same kind of
rioting,'' Flake said. ``I don't know if anybody else could have
done that.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, certainly, an element of political piling-on here. The
Diallo tragedy aside, many of the people who have showed up at 1
Police Plaza are united by their dislike for Giuliani and have
seized at the image of him on the political ropes. But more than
just opportunism is at work here. The Diallo shooting has forced a
public examination of how the city police conduct their business,
precisely the issue that Sharpton _ and, not incidentally, Dinkins
and Rangel _ have talked about for years.
</P>
<P>
   With Diallo's death, and the steeply falling crime rate,
warnings about police excesses have new legitimacy. Sharpton sensed
this well before most of the city's political establishment, and
has skillfully made the most of it.
</P>
<P>
   This latest up in Sharpton's up-and-down career is also
testimony to his political skills. He has an astute sense of how to
attract attention to himself and to his causes, playing the role of
the passionate if irreverent outsider to great effect.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton has a sense for political theatrics that few can match.
He arranged for Diallo's mother to return from Africa so she could
be present Tuesday when the officers accused of killing her son are
expected to be arraigned. ``Let the mother stand and stare when
they bring them in handcuffs,'' Sharpton said. ``Now that's
drama!''

EVEN BELLE'S A SHOWMAN IN ORIOLES VICTORY IN CUBA 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HAVANA _ Albert Belle went 0 for 5 in Sunday's unprecedented
exhibition game between the Baltimore Orioles and a group of select
Cuban players, but he managed to make some new friends.
</P>
<P>
   After putting on an impressive batting-practice session, one
that included more than 10 home runs, most of them deep into the
bleachers, Belle received an ovation from the fans who began filing
into Estadio Latinoamerica five hours before the first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they're used to controversy here,'' Belle joked
moments after he smiled and waved to the crowd in a rare display of
interaction with fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles, who became the first major league club to play in
Cuba since a pair of exhibition games between Los Angeles and
Cincinnati in 1959, squandered a late two-run lead but came back to
beat Cuba, 3-2, in 11 innings Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The game began with intensity when former Cuban pitcher Conrado
Marrero, now 84 years old, fired the ceremonial first pitches to
Orioles leadoff hitter Brady Anderson, who didn't know it is
customary here to take a swing at one pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson finally caught on and fouled off a bunt attempt, and
suddenly two of the archest enemies on the planet were making
history as the United States and Cuba televised the game to all
points in their respective nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all the same, especially on the sports field,'' said
Alfonso Urquiola, who managed Cuba's club. ``We demonstrated Cuba
can play in any league. We have been practicing together for only
two weeks, and look at the type of game we played.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans probably took this game far more seriously than the
Orioles, who didn't have an entire nation hoping and following
their every move the way the Cuban club did.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that hurt us was only having two weeks to
practice together,'' said Jose Ariel Contreras, a strapping
6-foot-3 right-hander who pitched eight scoreless innings in
relief. ``I was anxious because an American professional team was
making its first appearance on our land in 40 years. Now we know we
can play.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are scheduled to meet again May 3 at Baltimore's
Camden Yards. It will be interesting to see if the Cuban club will
be reinforced with key additions from the two teams currently
locked up in Cuba's version of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Orioles catcher Charles Johnson, a favorite of local fans who
was making his third appearance in Cuba, belted a two-run home run
in the bottom of the second inning for the game's first two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore pitcher Scott Erickson, who bent over backward to call
this only a baseball game, pitched six scoreless innings before
allowing one run in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba tied the game in the bottom of the eighth when Omar
Linares, arguably the best amateur player in the world, lined a
two-out RBI single to left to tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was delighted it was tied,'' Orioles owner Peter Angelos
said of Cuban President Fidel Castro, whom he sat next to for the
entire game. ``He's obviously a fanatic baseball fan.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was decided in the 11th when Harold Baines stroked an
RBI single to center field, the same way he's done on so many other
occasions during his 20-year career.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans, however, viewed the game as a great victory,
especially considering how little time the players worked together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our baseball is strong,'' Linares said. ``We showed we can
play at the same level as the best teams. We can beat them when we
play them again.'' &QL;

GOODYEAR RACES TO IRL VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Great Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Goodyear survived a rash of caution flags, including a
doozy on Lap 149 that put disgruntled front-runners Eddie Cheever
and Buddy Lazier behind the pit wall with busted machinery. Then he
led the final 51 laps and won the MCI WorldCom 200 on Sunday at
Phoenix International Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   It was Goodyear's first career trip into a Pep Boys Indy Racing
League victory lane, and it was worth a tidy $139,600 to the
Canadian driver.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear should bill the IRL an extra $50,000 for hazard pay.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was that wild.
</P>
<P>
   Eight cautions produced 62 laps of stoppage, leaving only 14
cars still running at the checkered flag, only five of which
remained on the lead lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough out there today,'' said runner-up Jeff Ward, who
trailed Goodyear by 4.738 seconds at the finish.
</P>
<P>
   If not for a final caution for Roberto Moreno's spin on Lap 192,
it wouldn't have been that close.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some real big moments out there,'' said third-place
Robbie Buhl, who is getting married next Sunday in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear also had some moments, including one when he
momentarily thought he might be in for a short day.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got to Turn 3 (and the site of the Cheever-Lazier
wreckage), there wasn't a lane available,'' Goodyear said. ``I
almost ran into the back of (defending champion) Scott Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this might be the Fourth of July all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Goodyear was the beneficiary of an early Christmas
present.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a situation where I could have gone home with a
headache or not even gone home,'' said Goodyear, whose best
previous IRL finish was runner-up, which he's done four times.
``Today (Sunday) was my lucky day.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucky, maybe. But Goodyear also was skillfully efficient.
</P>
<P>
   He led twice for 134 laps in the Pennzoil Panther G
Force/Aurora, including Laps 15-96.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Boat of Glendale was next highest, leading 29 laps
(98-126) and finishing fourth, one position ahead of Scott
Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   And when Boat ducked into the pits on Lap 127 for fuel and fresh
rubber, it was Cheever's turn to lead.
</P>
<P>
   Cheever might have held the lead even longer than he did if not
for the Lap 149 tangle.
</P>
<P>
   But as Cheever was rushing his brain into overdrive in an
attempt to quickly strategize the best way to ease by Harrington,
Harrington suddenly had to ease off the throttle for a slower
machine and inadvertently tapped Cheever.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a tap that took on heavy-metal consequences as a
fast-approaching Lazier couldn't slam on the brakes in time to
avoid smacking into Cheever's rear end.
</P>
<P>
   Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   Out went Cheever and Lazier and into the lead went Goodyear,
where he remained despite one final nerve-racking caution flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Man, what's this all about?' '' Goodyear said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheever was asking the same question following his exit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buddy and I were going at it pretty aggressively, and there
were slower cars not looking in their mirrors,'' Cheever said.
``It's silly when you come up to a car you've lapped a few times
and they don't move over.''
</P>
<P>
   Silly and costly.
</P>
<P>
   For Ward, finishing second in front of an estimated crowd of
about 15,000 wasn't such a bad thought, considering where he was
less than two weeks ago: unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Ward had left former employer ISM Racing and had only recently
signed with car owner Allan Pagan, whose original intent was to
race only at the Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   But Ward, who was joined at Pagan Racing by several former ISM
employees, including crew chief/engineer Mitch Davis, had other
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things happened quickly,'' Ward said. ``We decided we needed
to be here and try and get some points. Not having points doesn't
look good when you're trying to attract sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll sit down now and talk about what we need to do for the
rest of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   What Goodyear needs to do is not forget what he did to get where
he was at about 4 p.m. Sunday, which was in the winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest thing was making sure (the car) was there at the
end,'' Goodyear said. ``I just tried to pace myself.''.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear did. Right into victory lane. &QL;

CHANGES IN STREET CRIME UNIT MAY HURT ITS EFFECTIVENESS  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As officers in the Street Crime Unit reported _ in
uniform _ for duty Sunday, many law enforcement officials said that
Police Commissioner Howard Safir's decision to end the unit's
plain-clothes operations would make it less controversial, but also
less effective.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with mounting criticism in the seven weeks since the
Amadou Diallo killing, Safir announced Friday that he would require
Street Crime Unit officers to work in uniform and that he would
replace 50 members of the overwhelmingly white unit with minority
officers.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would try to attract candidates by elevating the
unit's status with promotions and annual raises of $1,500, and by
making the assignment part of a career path leading to the
prestigious detective bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Those moves may ease the criticism from those city residents who
charge that the Street Crimes Unit has produced impressive arrest
and gun seizure statistics by being too aggressive and infringing
on the civil rights of residents in minority neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But tactically, the new dress code that began last night will
deprive the unit of one of its most valuable weapons _ stealth _
and will limit the squad's ability to perform surveillance in
high-crime neighborhoods, officers and former commanders said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the changes said they amounted to tampering with a
proven formula. During the last five years, the Street Crimes Unit
has functioned as a kind of rapid deployment force, a platoon of
gung-ho officers dispatched to high-crime neighborhoods with a
mandate to aggressively search for illegal guns and violent felons.
</P>
<P>
   The unit's results were so impressive _ it makes up less than 2
percent of the police force but confiscated 40 percent of all the
illegal weapons seized in the city _ that Safir tripled its
manpower from 130 to nearly 400 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Former Deputy Inspector Richard F. Savage, who was relieved of
his command of the Street Crimes Unit when he opposed Safir's
expansion plans in 1997, said the changes would prevent officers
from posing as decoys in areas where a mugger or rapist had been
carrying out a series of attacks. Savage said the uniform
requirement would also force officers to be more careful when they
approach people suspected of carrying weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still going to be looking for people with the bulge in
the waistband and the heavy pockets, and they're still going to pop
out of the car when they see someone who's wanted or who may be
carrying a weapon,'' Savage said. ``But in the past, they could
have parked the car, maybe gone around the block and found the
safest way to approach the situation. Now, the minute they leave
the vehicle, the bad guys immediately know who they are, and the
cops don't know who they're dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   Det. Terrance Wansley, a spokesman for the group 100 Blacks in
Law Enforcement, and other black officers said that the decision to
make the unit more racially diverse is so long overdue that it will
do little to change the suspicion that its officers and many
residents of minority neighborhoods feel toward each other.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Diallo shooting, the department has ordered every
member of the Street Crimes Unit to attend racial sensitivity
classes, which have been taught by a community affairs sergeant who
is also a member of 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant, who discussed the meetings on the condition of
anonymity, said they were surprisingly tense, marred by icy stares
and in one case a shouting match, leaving black officers stunned by
the depth of the alienation that some street crimes officers
expressed toward minority residents and their black and Latino
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's such deep racial divisions in that unit, that it's
going to take a lot more than just throwing a few raisins into the
milk bowl to change things,'' said Eric Adams, the president of 100
Blacks in Law Enforcement.

NCAA OPTS FOR GREED, LETS THE FANS BE DOMED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, FLA. - Greed kills, greed consumes, and here it
is: Living under a Teflon roof, crawling inside a hideous baseball
stadium, sucking every possible penny from a staggering tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Shame on the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball is meant for arenas, not domes. And there's no reason
that the Final Four shouldn't come to Phoenix. Not ``if'' the grass
at BOB can handle the duress or ``if'' the Rio Salado project
becomes a reality.
</P>
<P>
   It should come to America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Or the United Center in Chicago. Or the Delta Center in Salt
Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   No reason to stay away, except for greed.
</P>
<P>
   Come now. Who's running the sport? Juan Antonio Samaranch?
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a dash of Gonzaga and a spoonful of Wally Szczerbiak,
this tournament is threatening to be the worst of the decade. If
ever the NCAA needed a warm-and-fuzzy finish, a strong sense of
atmosphere to compensate for the lack of drama, this is it.
Instead, they are stuck in a terrible venue, with teams and fans
dispersed across the bay area. A hollow experience, satisfying no
one but accountants and ticket scalpers and educators auctioning
their product to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   It is a sad juxtaposition. A sport you can rub shoulders with _
accessible, friendly, quaint. And the domes _ monstrous and
sterile, symbols of big business.
</P>
<P>
   I am sitting in Section 323 of Tropicana Field, formerly known
as the Thunder Dome. I am in the worst seat in the house, face
value $80, a Mark McGwire moon-shot removed from the court. Below
me, a media work room. Panning to the right, a giant curtain. An
obnoxious set of temporary bleachers. A wide aisle. A thick set of
tables for the media. And, finally, fading out of view, the floor.
But the rim looks like a thimble, and I may as well be watching
from the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, nearly every fan in this area used binoculars. In
fact, one gentleman paid a scalper $1,600 for a ticket, unaware of
the location. He ended up here, watching ants.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the exception. Even the best seat in the place is
well removed from the floor. And any intimacy you think you see on
television is a lie, a trick of the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the spirit of college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   This is basket-blur.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the NCAA sold out. They established a formula, putting
a premium on arenas with a minimum of 30,000 seats. With a few
blips _ 1990 in Denver, 1994 in Charlotte and 1996 in New Jersey _
they went for the money. Now, there is no deviation. The tournament
is booked through 2007, and by then, domes will have an 11-year
winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swish'' has been overpowered by ``cha-ching,'' and the message
from the NCAA is clear: Build us a cash machine, and we will come.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like the NCAA needs money. In 1991, they signed a $1
billion deal with CBS. In 1995, they re-negotiated, upping the ante
to $1.75 billion for seven years. The additional ticket revenue,
even with the multiplier effect of concession and souvenir sales,
barely makes a dent on the ledger.
</P>
<P>
   No reason for the domes, except for greed.
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet, an exclusive rotation is forming. Indianapolis is
great, a basketball mecca with a down-sized dome. San Antonio isn't
bad, but a locale no one associates with the sport. Atlanta is a
terrible sports town. New Orleans is a wasteland with a dome big
enough to warrant its own area code.
</P>
<P>
   Why not Phoenix? Boston? New York? Places where basketball has
roots and arenas to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Greed only grows, and the NCAA will never change. It sees the
domes as a symbol of growth and popularity, proof that the sport
has come a long way from the Cow Palace in San Francisco and the
Pit in New Mexico. And, of course, the folks in charge will claim
they are only catering to interest, serving the demand.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, they are betraying the fans. And the sport. And the
very essence of the game, a tournament balling for dollars and
nothing else. &QL;

KNICKS LOSE CONTROL OF EMOTIONS AND GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ This was not the strategy the New York
Knicks had in mind. There was no thinking and no plan. There was
just chaos as the Knicks concluded a disheartening West Coast swing
with a 99-91 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers at the Forum on Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, an ineffective and exasperated Patrick Ewing, who
hit just nine of 24 shots and scored 20 quiet points, fouled out
with 23.4 seconds left. The Lakers, led by Kobe Bryant's 29 points,
left the Knicks 1-2 on their road trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks (16-14) played with too much of an edge, too
combative. Dennis Rodman was probably at the root of that. But with
the Knicks unable to contain their emotions, it led to the ejection
of Kurt Thomas at the end of the third quarter and Chris Dudley
four minutes into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Already upset by his shaky play and frustrated with the
officials enough to have been assessed a technical foul, Ewing was
the only big man left standing. After he picked up his fifth foul
with just over six minutes left in the game, he played tentatively
while the Lakers broke free with the aid of two 3-pointers in the
last three and a half minutes by the former Knick Derek Harper.
They went on an 11-4 run to take control of the game.
</P>
<P>
   And to think the Knicks had pulled to within 3 points early in
the fourth on a 3-pointer by Latrell Sprewell _ the only man in
blue with some life in his game _ before the Knicks came undone.
</P>
<P>
   With six minutes 13 second left in the game, Shaquille O'Neal
came up with an emphatic, rim-swinging dunk. He came down, then
shoved Dudley, who then threw the ball at O'Neal. Both were called
for technical fouls. But for hurling the ball and hitting O'Neal,
Dudley received an automatic ejection. Seven minutes earlier,
Thomas had been ejected after taking down Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of things to take everyone's mind off the
game, like the strain between Sprewell and coach Jeff Van Gundy and
the dislike O'Neal recently expressed for Ewing's leadership during
the National Basketball Association's lockout. And then there was
the distracting blond walking by, Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Innocent Dennis. Rodman became a visible part of this game in
his passive resistance toward the end of the third quarter. After
Sprewell scored on a putback with 2.4 seconds on the clock, Rodman,
jockeying for rebounding position, was collared and tossed to the
ground by Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently fed up with Rodman's elbowing, Thomas jumped on
Rodman and tossed him again. Rodman, acting like a rag doll,
allowed himself to be thrown to the floor. During the altercation,
Chris Childs and Rick Fox began jawing at each other.
</P>
<P>
   When the melee ended, Thomas was hit with a flagrant foul and
was ejected, and Fox was hit with a technical. Nothing for Rodman.
And as the third period ended, the Knicks were behind, 72-65. They
were close because of Sprewell, who helped the Knicks cut the
Lakers' 14-point lead with an 8-point flurry.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the tension of this matchup, there was a road game the
Knicks were desperate to win in order to go back home from their
three-game West Coast trip with some confidence to face the Indiana
Pacers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had a lot to play for, and so much to go up against.
The Knicks had a blatant plan: foul O'Neal into oblivion. That's
why Van Gundy started Dudley next to Ewing for the first time.
That's why he kept rotating his big men. In some way, the strategy
was effective in the first half. O'Neal was sent to the free-throw
line nine times and made just two shots as a part of his 10-point
first half.
</P>
<P>
   All the Knicks' efforts to contain O'Neal did nothing to stop
the tricky Bryant and smooth-shooting Glen Rice. Bryant sent Allan
Houston and then Childs spinning with his fakes on his way to 17
first-half points. At his side, Rice was launching jumpers over
Larry Johnson and then Sprewell while piling up 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers did not need to ride O'Neal as they built a 14-point
lead in the second quarter. The Knicks' ball movement came to a
halt. They came up with just one assist and shot 26 percent from
the field. Although the Knicks put on a mini-run before the break,
they trailed by 50-42, close despite Ewing making just four of 12
shots against O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   This was the big-man matchup on the marquee: O'Neal vs. Ewing.
Not only is there a history between the two as each tried to assert
himself as the man when O'Neal was with the Orlando Magic, but
there was added tension because of the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal wasn't happy with the collective bargaining agreement _
which will limit the potential for him to make $20 million a year
under the old deal to $14 million if he opts out of his current
contract _ and holds Ewing's leadership as president to blame for
it. O'Neal's recent comments seemed to irritate Ewing. But O'Neal
didn't care if it meant a more inspired game by Ewing, and said he
``feared no man.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Ewing said he planned to bring his ``A game'' to
face the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't exactly setting the curve against them. After
beginning 4 for 6, Ewing missed eight shots in a row, including his
first two in the third quarter. He finally got a jumper to fall
three minutes into the third quarter at a point when the Lakers had
rebuilt their lead to 14.
</P>
<P>
   In danger of falling off the face of this game, Sprewell brought
his West Coast style, with its self-centered flair, to the floor.
He led an 8-2 run in the third quarter, punctuated by a violent,
one-handed dunk on the break after a Laker turnover to pull the
Knicks within 66-60 with 2:34 left. That dunk was only the
beginning of the craziness.

DUKE VS. UCONN: NO SURPRISE HERE  
 ELITE TO MEET IN CHAMPIONSHIP GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ This is where we expected to be all
along, isn't it? A college basketball season filled with upsets and
talk of parity, followed by nearly three weeks of an unpredictable,
surprise-filled NCAA Tournament has led us to the most logical
conclusion of all.
</P>
<P>
   In the final game of the year, Duke (37-1), the best team in the
nation, perhaps one of the best teams ever, will play the
second-best team, Connecticut (33-2), tonight for the NCAA
Championship at Tropicana Field.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, any player in this position would be excited. But
some of the fans' anticipation of this particular game has
penetrated the baseball stadium's Teflon-coated, fiberglass roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see Duke and UConn,'' Duke forward Chris Carrawell said
Sunday, ``I don't think you can ask for a better match-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke, the first team ever to go 16-0 in the Atlantic Coast
Conference, has been so dominant for most of the season that
figuring out its place in history has become a sport unto itself.
</P>
<P>
   There's just one problem, at least right now: UConn. Fittingly,
the last team standing other than the Blue Devils, seems to be the
one team in the tournament with the best chance of beating Duke,
although Michigan State gave it a pretty good go on Saturday before
losing, 68-62.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to win,'' UConn Coach Jim Calhoun said.
</P>
<P>
   In virtually the next breath, Calhoun said Duke ``has proven
beyond a reasonable doubt that they are the best team in the
country.'' UConn, said Calhoun, is the clear-cut No. 2, and when
No. 1 and No. 2 get together, ``it makes for an intriguing
match-up.''
</P>
<P>
   But it will only be intriguing if UConn plays its best game of
the year, not the ``moments and minutes and hoffs (halves),'' as
Calhoun inflected.
</P>
<P>
   With All-America Richard Hamilton at one forward, strong, steady
Kevin Freeman at the other, flashy, dashing Khalid El-Amin at the
point, top defender Ricky Moore at the other guard and a decent
bench, it is possible.
</P>
<P>
   UConn is the ``best offensive transition team in the country,''
Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski said. Individually, Krzyzewski is most
concerned about Hamilton, who scored 24 points against Ohio State.
Noting that Calhoun gives Hamilton uncommon freedom on offense,
Krzyzewski called the 6-foot-6 junior ``as good a scorer as there
is in college basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun has his team playing tough man-to-man defense, but Duke
simply might have too many weapons. The arsenal includes point
guard William Avery, a high school teammate of Moore, off-guard
Trajan Langdon, forwards Shane Battier and Carrawell, and sixth-man
Corey Maggette, an acrobatic freshman forward who not only would
start for anyone else, would also be all-conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone would have to recognize Corey as our best
athlete,'' Krzyzewski said.
</P>
<P>
   But the player occupying most of Calhoun's pre-game thoughts,
not to mention a lot of space around the basket, is Duke center
Elton Brand. The 6-foot-8, 260-pound sophomore has won several
national player of the year honors and is likely to be the first
Duke non-senior to go pro, although he plans to be there tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you deal with a player like Elton Brand, it's a
challenge for the entire team,'' said Freeman, who is expected to
lend help to center Jake Voskuhl.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies a huge problem for the Huskies. Guarded
one-on-one, Brand is nearly impossible to handle. Double-teamed,
with other defenders leaving their man to help out, Brand knows
what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You double Elton and somebody's gonna beat you, no matter who
it is,'' Carrawell said. ``It's kind of interesting. We want to see
who they double off of. Whoever it is, is gonna have a great
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun said he and his staff have been laboring to figure out
just how to play Brand _ who will double him and when, and how the
defense will rotate. But even that might not matter, because of
Duke's depth and versatility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can keep lineups on the court that are very compatible,''
Krzyzewski said. ``We don't take a dip when we go to the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Special teams end up in special places, and there is more to
Duke than simply talent. Krzyzewski cites other reasons for the
Blue Devils' success, pointing to Langdon's leadership, the
maturity of a group that includes 10 underclassmen and his players'
work habits.
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, allows Krzyzewski to permit freedom on the court,
to let the players express their individuality while still
operating within the framework of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This group has been such a pleasure to teach because they
constantly want to learn,'' he said. ``They want to get better.''

BP AMOCO AND ARCO ARE REPORTED TO BE HOLDING TALKS ON A MERGER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to fix 6th-graf spelling of Browne)  (nk) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS and LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BP Amoco PLC, the giant oil company, has been in serious
discussions to buy the Atlantic Richfield Co., the oil and gas
exploration and refining concern, executives close to the talks
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations, which have been going on for months, have not
yet produced a deal and could still collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Sir John Browne, the chief executive of BP Amoco,
met last week with Michael R. Bowlin, the chairman and chief
executive of ARCO, and there have been discussions about price,
according to the people close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   If an agreement is reached, an announcement could come as early
as this week.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed deal for ARCO, which is based in Los Angeles and is
the nation's eighth-largest oil company, could be complicated,
however, if another bidder emerges.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Sieminski, an oil analyst with BT Alex. Browne, said that
BP Amoco would have to offer about $25 billion, or a 20 percent
premium over its closing price of $65.375 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Browne has been a pacesetter in his industry for mergers, which
have been spurred by a year of low crude oil prices that dampened
the earnings of most large oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, he jolted the industry by announcing an agreement
to buy the Amoco Corporation, which was based in Chicago, in a deal
valued at about $48 billion at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Browne wasted little time, vowing to save $2 billion a year in
costs and deftly steering the complex transaction around many
regulatory hurdles to completion in late December.
</P>
<P>
   ``He closed it quickly,'' Sieminski said. ``He has taken
charge.''
</P>
<P>
   His bold move led Lee R. Raymond, the chairman of Exxon, to
offer to buy the Mobil Corp. for $80 billion in December, a deal
that would form the world's largest corporation.
</P>
<P>
   If Browne succeeds in acquiring ARCO, which has a market value
of about $21 billion, it will catapult BP Amoco into a tie with
Royal Dutch/Shell Group for second place among the giant
international oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   With the emergence of such giants, who have also formed
alliances with other companies to help cut costs in refining in the
United States and Europe, smaller oil companies like ARCO have
scrambled to find strategies to survive.
</P>
<P>
   With crude oil prices plunging from about $18 a barrel at this
time last year to as low as $12, ARCO saw its earnings drop to
$1.79 a share last year from $5.28 a share in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ARCO, which gets a larger share of its profits from oil sales
than its largest U.S. rivals, had a fourth-quarter loss of $794
million, or $2.47 a share, its first unprofitable quarter in six
years. The company took charges to write down assets and inventory
because of low oil prices and also for costs associated with
cutting 1,200 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a recent recovery in crude oil prices because of cuts
in production announced by major oil-exporting nations, analysts
were wondering whether ARCO could earn enough this year to pay its
yearly dividend of $2.85 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Bowlin has attempted to strengthen ARCO, selling its chemical
business last year for $5.6 billion. He also acquired an
independent oil company, Union Texas Holdings Inc. of Houston, for
$2.47 billion last May to bolster ARCO's reserves and gain entry
into the Caspian Sea region, where most large oil companies are
vying for rights to develop fields with vast reserves.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he has let analysts know that he would welcome
a an offer for the company if the price was right for shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Neither company's representatives returned calls Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As with Amoco, Browne is expected to face few antitrust
problems, which mostly concern the refining and marketing of
gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   ARCO has a significant refining and marketing operations on the
West Coast, an area where BP Amoco has little presence.
</P>
<P>
   ARCO and British Petroleum were the main companies that
developed the vast reserves in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, where
production, while still substantial, has been falling.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Federal Trade Commission, which would review the
transaction, has focused on the competitive effects of refining
rather than crude oil production, where entry is more open and
there are many areas of opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco could save money by combining Alaskan operations. ARCO,
by developing new fields, has stemmed the decline of its production
in Alaska but has found it hard to come up with the huge amounts of
capital needed to make inroads in areas such as the Caspian Sea. BP
Amoco produced 450,000 barrels of oil a day from Alaska last year,
while Arco produced 317,000 barrels a day, company figures show.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Browne has not let up on cutting costs. He announced
on Feb. 17 that BP Amoco would cut 10,000 jobs and speed up its
goal of getting $2 billion in annual savings in one year rather
than two.
</P>
<P>
   He added that BP Amoco would take $1.5 billion in charges this
year, mainly to cover the costs of severance for the workers who
lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   As most oil executives do, he wants to make his company
profitable even if the current run-up in crude oil prices fizzles
and the harsh conditions of the last year continue.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE BIG SWITCH IS THE BIG STORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Nicole Erickson had a dream. Michele VanGorp
held a grudge. Gail Goestenkors heard their yarns spun and re-spun
and could stand it no more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've asked the kids not to talk about the Purdue transfer,''
Goestenkors, the Duke coach, said before Sunday night's women's
college basketball final. ``We're really tired of it. It's time to
move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry. Too late. The title was on the line, Lin Dunn was in the
stands, and this most compelling angle was on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue versus Duke had tension and drama, the feel of
Hollywood-scripted symmetry, right down to the very last dribble.
Duke's two best players, Erickson and VanGorp, were going to defeat
the school they had transferred from in mutual protest three years
ago, or not. Stephanie White-McCarty and Ukari Figgs, the two
Purdue senior backcourt stars, were going to repel their former
teammates and raise the Hoosier banner, or not.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, the gray-haired matriarch whose firing at Purdue set the
dominoes in motion, was going to watch two of her former players
crowned national champs. One way or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's very, very interesting for all of you,''
Goestenkors said, and she was right.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, there was the stunning Tennessee threepeat, one team
sprinting miles away from rest of the field. This time around, we
had two teams that just couldn't stay out of each other's lives. We
had VanGorp, the 6-foot-6-inch center, invoking the name of Dunn in
the colors of Duke, through a yellow mouth guard custom-made for
her at Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had no reason to fire her,'' said VanGorp, her jump shot
and elbows primed for revenge.
</P>
<P>
   There is never a bad time to tell a good story, or at least
that's what they told us back in journalism school. Monday night's
Duke-UConn men's final in St. Petersburg on network television
will, as usual, dwarf the women's cable ratings, but no one should
ever compare these two games, the two sports, that are at
completely different points on the evolutionary scale. More than
that, the National Collegiate Athletic Association should resist
the growing sentiment within the women's game to move its Final
Four forward, or back.
</P>
<P>
   No less an authority than the decorated Stanford coach, Tara
VanDerveer, disagrees, asserting that the women could get off ESPN
and back on the network by surrendering this weekend to the men.
``What is the big deal going back a weekend or two?'' she said. ``I
mean, they play basketball in the summer now.''
</P>
<P>
   Her sister does not even have cable, VanDerveer said, and thus,
like many others, has no access to these games. Fair point. But
there is something defeatist, isolationist, about the women having
to pack up their gear and move to attract more attention. The
inherent appeal of college basketball has always been its festival
milieu. There are too many reasons, too many trends, not to believe
that they eventually will outgrow being kid sister on cable.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday happened to be the 20th anniversary of the men's final
matching Michigan State and Indiana State, Magic Johnson and Larry
Bird, which should put into context the women's developmental
progress. I seem to recall visiting a few men's subregional sites
back in those years when the stands were empty. Every year now, the
women's tournament gets bigger, noisier, edgier.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a couple of million people in this country,'' said
Leon Barmore, the Louisiana Tech coach. ``We shouldn't worry about
who's watching the men. We've got our fans, more every year.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a betting line on the women's games in Las Vegas this
week for the first time, and that ought to tell the women to hold
their ground, that this wild weekend belongs to them, too. The
staggering number of air miles logged this weekend by Joe Alleva,
the Duke athletic director, suggests they can't be ignored, no
matter what is happening cross country with the men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is good exposure for Duke, more than it is for
women's basketball,'' Alleva said after his latest Ping-Pong shot
back from St. Petersburg early Sunday morning. ``I do think the
women would be better off with their own Final Four weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because Alleva and the other Duke administrators surely
would have preferred schmoozing the alumni in Florida between
games, as opposed to straining their backs in a seven-seat,
lavatory-less jet. Since Duke for years virtually ignored its
women's program while basking in its reputation as an enlightened
institution of higher education and basketball erudition, maybe we
should take the Duke double as a message from the gender equality
gods.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Erickson claimed the other day that she had dreamed that
her college career would conclude in the championship game, against
her and VanGorp's old school. Never hold a good story, I always
say, out of fear it won't be the best. There is always room for a
dream come true.

AVERY, MOORE MEET AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Their careers began together on the
playgrounds of Augusta, Ga. They went to the same elementary school
and the same junior high. They were teammates and close friends at
Augusta's Westside High. They won a prep title together, and
tonight they'll play for the NCAA championship.
</P>
<P>
   On different teams.
</P>
<P>
   Duke sophomore guard William Avery and Connecticut senior guard
Ricky Moore will compete against each for the first time tonight
when they meet in Tropicana Field. Once it's over, they'll be
friends. For now, forget it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know him right now,'' Avery said. ``After the
buzzer, it'll be like, `Oh yeah, we grew up together.' But right
now, I'm trying not to find him or call him on the telephone or
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, a defensive specialist who will shadow Avery during the
game, was Avery's surrogate big brother in Augusta. They were prep
teammates for two years, then Moore departed for Connecticut. Avery
played at Westside as a junior, then spent one season at famed Oak
Hill Academy before matriculating to Duke.
</P>
<P>
   ``In junior high, I wanted the same number (Moore) had worn in
football and basketball,'' Avery said. ``Everyone liked him in the
community, and I really looked up to him. I even tried to model my
game after him for a little while. . . . He was the teacher and I
was the student. I looked up to him from eighth grade on.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore was thrilled to have Avery around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took him under my wing in high school,'' Moore said. ``He's
done a great job at Duke. I think he's matured a lot. It'll be real
special (tonight), just out on the court competing against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Doin' it all: Duke sophomore forward Shane Battier is one of the
Blue Devils' most versatile players and their best defender.
Battier, who worked for Morgan Stanley's equity research department
in New York City last summer, knows his best bet for recognition is
to play defense, set picks and grab offensive rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not too often in this day and age that people will take
charges and play position defense,'' Battier said. ``I know I won't
get on `SportsCenter' for the fancy dunks, so why not get some
recognition taking a charge?''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes: Duke and Connecticut, the only teams ranked No. 1 in
the regular season, have more at stake than the national title.
</P>
<P>
   For Duke, a victory secures its place as the team of the decade:
Both the Blue Devils and Kentucky have won two national titles in
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   For Connecticut, it's a chance to exact revenge for two NCAA
Tournament losses to Duke this decade _ including a crushing
overtime loss in 1990 on Christian Laettner's buzzer-beater.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us were around, so we're not even thinking about it,''
Connecticut point guard Khalid El-Amin said.
</P>
<P>
   But Huskies coach Jim Calhoun has thought about Duke, thought
about who can beat Duke and how to beat Duke. Sunday, his praise
for the Blue Devils nearly reached a state of awe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duke has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that it's the best
team in the country,'' Calhoun said. ``I don't have any question
about that. They're the best team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have won. We're near the same dominating factor. But
clearly I think we've become the second best.''

INTERNATIONAL VENTURE TO OFFER ONLINE PURCHASING SYSTEM
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass. )  (nk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In an effort to move more business-to-business
purchasing transactions to the Internet, a pioneer in the field
plans to announce partnerships on Monday with two giant
international telecommunications carriers to create a global
trading network.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce One, a small software company in Walnut Creek, Calif.,
plans to announce partnership agreements with Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone and British Telecommunications intended to enable
businesses to use the Internet to automate the purchasing process.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce One, which already has a relationship with MCI Worldcom
in the United States, has developed software systems that enable
companies to transform their purchasing interactions into real-time
trading networks.
</P>
<P>
   Such systems have long been envisioned by proponents of
so-called electronic data interchange, or EDI systems, which were
intended to replace purchase orders and bills of laden with online
digital documents. But the emergence of the Internet as a global
standard in the last five years has vastly accelerated the pace of
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite clear that this is the future,'' said Jay M.
Tenenbaum, chief scientist of Commerce One. ``After 20 years, about
100,000 companies are using EDI systems. But the fact is that more
than a million companies are on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of much new Internet business-to-business commerce
activity is a computer-to-computer translation language known as
XML that is being rapidly adopted by many companies, from start-ups
to corporate giants like IBM and Microsoft. XML simplifies and
automates the process of business-to-business interaction.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce One executives say that the company's new partnerships
will sharply increase the efficiency of doing business
internationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``NTT is going to work with major players in Japan,'' said Mark
Hoffman, the chairman and chief executive of Commerce One. ``Now it
is possible to reach all of the big suppliers in Japan in one fell
swoop.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that Commerce One had built a leading position as
a result of its strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commerce One has ended up being in the catbird seat,'' said
Stan Dolberg, an analyst at Forrester Research, a research and
consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. ``They are well down the road
to figuring out that this is the killer application.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of their agreements, both NTT and British Telecom will
deploy a Commerce One software program known as Marketsite. The
software is meant to automate the steps of selecting, ordering,
processing, shipping and paying for products.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce One executives called theirs an ``open'' commerce
system, meaning that it is possible to participate either by
purchasing software from Commerce One or a rival, or by creating
the software independently, Tenenbaum said.

2 MAKERS PLAN INTRODUCTIONS OF DIGITAL VCR
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (nk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Two Silicon Valley makers of digital VCRs plan
to make announcements on Monday about their services and products,
which enable television viewers to filter, store and retrieve
programs as digitized video.
</P>
<P>
   Tivo Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., plans to announce that it is
introducing its service in partnership with Royal Philips
Electronics N.V., the Dutch electronics company, which will begin
selling the storage devices, known as Personal TV Receivers, for
$499. The receivers, which will initially be sold through the
Internet or via a toll-free telephone number, will become available
in consumer electronics outlets this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Tivo's system is similar to another service to be announced on
Monday, and scheduled to begin next month, from Replay Networks
Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Both systems also utilize a dial-up telephone-line connection
that downloads television listing information. Tivo is charging a
$9.95 monthly subscription fee for its service, while the Replay
service will be subsidized by advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Replay said the hardware for its system, capable of storing six
hours of digitized video, will be available in April and will be
priced at $699.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said it had obtained an $8 million investment
from a group led by the venture capital firm of Kleiner Perkins
Caufield &AMP; Byers. Other members of the group will include the
Tribune Co. and Vulcan Ventures Inc., the investment organization
of the Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Philips executives said the Tivo device would permit
consumers to store and retrieve up to 14 hours of video.
</P>
<P>
   A system with the capacity to store 30 hours will sell for $999,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our real goal is in the development of services that work in
conjunction with this technology,'' said Ed MacBeth, Tivo's vice
president for marketing and business development.
</P>
<P>
   Both Tivo and Replay have created technologies that begin to
blend the power of the personal computer with television. The idea
is to permit people to use television the way Web surfers now use
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For example, both systems permit the creation of custom
``channels,'' supported by filtering software that automatically
records all programs on particular subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The systems also permit digital rewind, fast-forward and pause
features.
</P>
<P>
   Such digital technology makes it possible for a viewer watching
a live basketball game to pause the action, go to the kitchen and
make a sandwich and then return to pick up the game in mid
jump-shot.

THE PLAYERS IN THE PRINTER-COPIER GAME CHANGE AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Conn.)  (nk) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, shuffle the deck again and deal out the logo cards. The list
of who is battling whom in the printer-copier market just changed
one more time.
</P>
<P>
   Barely two weeks ago, the Eastman Kodak Co. introduced the first
digital copier fast enough to compete with the Xerox Corp.'s most
sophisticated products. Kodak then promptly sold its entire copier
business to Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG, the big German offset
printing company that thus became the latest entrant to the copier
wars.
</P>
<P>
   And Sunday night, Xerox announced that it was buying SET
Electronique, a French company that makes continuous-feed printers
that can whip out 500 pages a minute. More significant, SET's
printers have a ``controller'' technology that enables them _
unlike Xerox's printers _ to accept data that are compatible with
printers made by IBM and Oce.
</P>
<P>
   With SET, Xerox for the first time could take on those two
titans in the market for printers that accept data from desktop
computers and turn large rolls of paper into 300 to 1,000 printed
business-size sheets a minute. Between them, IBM and Oce now
control 90 percent of this market, which serves banks, utility
companies and other big generators of transactional data like bills
and monthly statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``IBM and Oce competed with us in printers that use cut sheets,
and now we can compete with them, and with offset printers, in
continuous feed,'' said Pierre Danon, president of Xerox Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox's Delphax subsidiary already sells a continuous-feed
printer that runs 900 to 1,300 sheets a minute. But it can only
accept data from mainframes, not desktops.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this acquisition, Xerox can finally compete for the
high-end billing market,'' said Barbara Pellow, a director at CAP
Ventures, a research firm in Norwell, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Industry researchers estimate that the annual market for
printers that produce more than 80 pages a minute now tops $2
billion and is growing rapidly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Xerox will not say what it paid for SET. But the privately held
company may hold strategic value far exceeding its less than $50
million a year in annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be selling four times that amount in less than two
years,'' said Anshoo Gupta, president of Xerox's Production Systems
Group.
</P>
<P>
   SET's power lies in its controller technology, which helps Xerox
in two ways. First, it will enable the company to offer IBM and Oce
customers a rival product that they can just plug in, without
reprogramming anything. And perhaps more important, Xerox will no
longer have to watch helplessly as its own customers switch over to
Oce or IBM for their continuous-feed machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``This move is as much about preventing the loss of customers as
it is about taking someone else's customers away,'' said Julianne
Mehegan, a consultant at Lyra Research, a market analysis firm in
Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   While banks and other issuers of transactional data are the
prime users of continuous-feed printers, Xerox says it also plans
to go after small-run book publishing and other uses as well _
applications that might eventually turn the company into a
competitor to Heidelberger's offset printing operations. Industry
experts say that is a pipe dream for now, because few
continuous-feed printers, and certainly not the SET versions,
provide the print resolution those applications would need.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Xerox may be getting closer. Xerox's Delphax unit is
working on getting its print resolution up to the 600 dots an inch
considered the minimum for book publishing, and Delphax plans in
September to offer a machine that can take data from desktop
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a knock-your-socks-off acquisition from day one,
but it fills out Xerox's product line and gives it an important
relationship with Hitachi,'' said Jay Ingalls, research director at
the Gartner Group, a research firm in Stamford, Conn.

AMERICAN GROUND TROOPS MAY BE NEEDED IN KOSOVO

</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WASHINGTON _ If there are two words that jar the Clinton
administration more these days than ``Slobodan Milosevic,'' ``air
defense'' and ``ethnic cleansing,'' they are ``ground troops.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans barely support or understand the White House's
rationale for U.S. involvement in the NATO air war against
Yugoslavia, and the public appears prepared to strongly reject even
the thought of launching U.S. troops into a ground battle in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the Clinton administration's carefully worded
disavowal of intent to use U.S. combat soldiers to fight aggression
by Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, against some of his own
citizens, that prospect looms strongly on the not-too-distant
horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Possible use of ground troops increases with each day of reports
of new atrocities against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Genocide is starting,'' German Defense Minister Rudolf
Scharping said in a ZDF network interview. NATO spokesman Jamie
Shea said at alliance headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, that
Kosovo was seeing a humanitarian catastrophe ``the likes of which
we have not seen in Europe since the closing stages of World War
II.''
</P>
<P>
   Even President Clinton used the continuing attacks by Serbs on
Kosovar Albanians as a reason to keep up the NATO attacks _ if only
from the air. ``The continued brutality and repression of the Serb
forces further underscores the need for NATO to persevere,''
Clinton said Sunday after an hour-long White House briefing from
his top national security advisers.
</P>
<P>
   If one of the purposes of the now stepped-up air campaign
against Milosevic is to stop the atrocities and it does not work,
then the United States, as the alliance leader, will face _ some
would say should face _ calls to move beyond the aerial
bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   Even NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, when presented by a
journalist Sunday with a choice of continued atrocities or eventual
use of ground troops, wavered from the party line.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is more important is to stop the ethnic cleansing... ''
Solana said on ABC's This Week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not allow morally a situation like that in the core
of Europe when we are approaching the 21st century. We have to stop
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Solana's statement was accompanied by one of the carefully
phrased sidesteps around active consideration of ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Solana said, ``let's try to take every problem (one)
at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials clung in multiple television
appearances to the equivocal formulation that the president had
``no intention'' of using ground forces. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright even had to stop herself in mid-sentence on CBS
News' Face the Nation to get the right words.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will not send _ he says he has no intention,'' Albright
said, then she added a sentence that was daring, given how Clinton
sawed off the limb on which Albright climbed to deny his sexual
involvement with Monica Lewinsky. ``He is the commander-in-chief,''
Albright said. ``When he speaks, he should be respected.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, an Albright deputy, Undersecretary of State
Thomas Pickering, sought to fence off the American view of using
ground forces from any possibly differing European view or plan.
There are already about 12,000 European NATO troops in Macedonia
waiting to move just across the border into Kosovo if there is a
cease-fire and Milosevic agrees to an outside force to police the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Those European troops in Macedonia are the closest mass force
and possibly would be the first to move if NATO agreed on ground
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Europeans do, obviously, they will have to be responsible
for,'' Pickering said. It was an odd observation because European
leaders would almost certainly refuse to mount an invasion force to
move into Yugoslavia unless U.S. troops were included.
</P>
<P>
   Some leaders of NATO nations, especially Greece and Italy, are
already showing signs of strain from the air campaign. ``Talk about
ground troops, they're really queasy,'' observed former Senate
Majority Leader Bob Dole, the Republican who has acted as a special
envoy for Clinton in the Balkan conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said that a solely European
ground force should be considered, ``since we have taken the lion's
share in the air campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Solana said, NATO has given Macedonia ``all kinds of
assurances, if they are attacked by Milosevic, they will be
defended.''
</P>
<P>
   Mirroring the doubts of many military leaders and politicians
about the efficacy of an air-only strategy, Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., said Sunday that the allies ``have to exercise every
option.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the threat of ground forces could influence Milosevic,
McCain said on ABC's This Week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mr. Milosevic was convinced that (use of ground forces) is
an option that we might exercise, I think it could lend impetus to
convincing him that he cannot win and we will not allow him to
win,'' said McCain, a Navy pilot who was shot down during the
Vietnam War and held prisoner for seven years. ``We are a superior
force, and we must win this conflict with whatever it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Hutchison, who said she is ``absolutely'' opposed to the
use of U.S. ground troops against Yugoslavia, said NATO's disavowal
of such forces had told Milosevic too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic has heard everyone say no troops on the ground,''
Hutchison said. ``So instead of using his defensive air maneuvers,
he's gone on the ground and committed more atrocities.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, the supreme allied commander in
Europe, has suggested an air campaign may not bring Milosevic to
his knees or to the bargaining table. And the chairman of the U.S.
Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry Shelton, has said: ``We fully
understand the limits of air power.''
</P>
<P>
   But Shelton, on NBC's Meet the Press, recounted the harrowing
prospects of using ground forces: ``The commitment of NATO ground
troops would involve hundreds of thousands of ground troops over a
rather protracted period of time and in a very dangerous situation
unless you have a political settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelton conceded that NATO, six to eight months ago, ``made an
assessment'' of what ground troops ``might entail. But there are no
plans on the shelf or no plans under way at this particular time.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking at polls showing Americans more than 4-to-1 in
opposition to using ground forces in Yugoslavia, former Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger said the campaign against Milosevic cannot
be allowed to fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to take whatever measures are necessary,'' Kissinger
said on ABC, ``even reluctantly introducing ground forces, if that
is the only way to accomplish it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A member of the Lost Boyz, a popular hip hop group,
was shot to death early Sunday as he left a party at a Queens
hotel, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Rodgers, 28, who performed with the Lost Boyz under the
name Freaky Tah, was shot once in the head at 3:57 a.m. by a gunman
wearing a light blue ski mask as Rodgers was leaving the Four
Points Sheraton Hotel near Kennedy International Airport, said Sgt.
Gerry Falcon, police spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers was taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, where he
died a half hour later.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they did not know the motive, and detectives were
still looking for the gunman Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Lost Boyz, a group from Jamaica, Queens, was known for two
albums, ``Legal Drug Money'' and ``Love, Peace and Nappiness.'' The
Lost Boyz also had a hit song, ``Renee,'' which is about losing a
girlfriend to gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers, who lived in Queens, is survived by two sons and a
daughter.

   NATO WARPLANES BROADED ATTACK; US VOWS TO PERSEVERE WITHOUT
GROUND TROOPS
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
By JOHN C. HENRY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO dispatched more firepower Sunday against Serb
military units, a new phase in the air attacks that allied
officials said is spurred by reports of stepped-up atrocities
against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As the air assault entered a fifth day, the Clinton
administration again said there were no plans to use ground troops
in Kosovo and rejected calls to arm the Kosovo Liberation Army to
fend off the Yugoslav army, options some senators urged the
president to leave open.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees, recounting
scenes of Serb brutality, fled into neighboring Albania and
Macedonia, prompting officials to plead for international help to
avert a humanitarian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said there are as
many as 18,000 Serb troops now massing an offensive against the
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, the southernmost province of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are terrible reports about ... men being separated from
women and children, then they're being taken off and executed,
villages being torched, people arriving across the border with no
shoes, and literally told to leave their villages,'' Albright said
on CBS' Face the Nation.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, President Clinton said the NATO bombing
would continue until Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ends the
``inhumane violence'' in Kosovo. Following a meeting with his
national security team, Clinton told reporters ``the continued
brutality and repression of the Serb forces further underscores the
need for NATO to persevere.''
</P>
<P>
   As he headed toward Marine One for a flight to Camp David, the
president was asked if the air attacks might have prompted
Milosevic to step up the brutality in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' Clinton snapped.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of whether the bombing might be driving the ethnic
brutality was raised earlier with Albright, who dismissed the
assertion. ``That is just simply an upside down argument to think
that NATO or we have made this get worse,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic is the one that is to blame,'' Albright said. ``He
is the one that is making it worse and what we were trying to do is
to make sure that he pays the heaviest price for what he is
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if an air assault alone could cripple the paramilitary
units involved in the atrocities, Albright and Defense Secretary
William Cohen repeated Clinton's position that he has no intention
of sending ground troops to Kosovo unless the Serbs agree to the
peace deal already signed by ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a peace settlement, then he has indicated we'd be
prepared to contribute a small amount of a peace-keeping force, of
the total, but absent that, we're going to continue with the air
campaign,'' Cohen said on NBC's Meet the Press.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
on CNN that it would take ``hundreds of thousands of ground troops
over a rather protracted period of time and in a very dangerous
situation'' to invade Yugoslavia and forcefully stop the Serb
repression of the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., who chairs the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said he has never heard of a war ``that's been won
totally by air power.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam,
said the United States has ``to exercise every option'' once it
gets into armed conflict. ``We have to do whatever it takes,'' said
McCain, a possible GOP presidential candidate. ``All of us would
grieve at the loss of a single American. But when you go into these
things the primary purpose cannot be the safety of your forces, it
has to be the achievement of your strategic and tactical goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., agreed that airstrikes alone
will not stop the genocide but said fighting on the ground should
be left to ethnic Albanians, who should be supplied with arms by
the U.S. and its NATO partners. ``Clearly you can't stop the kind
of slaughter and terrorism on the ground without some contradictory
opposing force on the ground,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and NATO officials ruled out involvement in any ground war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue this campaign as long as it is necessary,
until the job is finished,'' said Sandy Berger, the president's
national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon late Sunday said that the United States, which
already has about 200 warplanes in Operation Allied Force, would be
assigning between six and 12 more aircraft _ including some B-52
long-range bombers _ to aid in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   As Sunday's bombing began under overcast skies, officials at the
Pentagon and NATO headquarters in Brussels declined to discuss
details from the downing Saturday of the Air Force F-117A stealth
fighter-bomber near the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press quoted an unnamed defense official as
saying there were strong indications the F-117 was hit by a
surface-to-air missile. The official said there was no reported
mechanical problem with the aircraft but an explosion was heard.
</P>
<P>
   Officials declined to name the U.S. pilot or to provide
information from Saturday night's six-hour mission to rescue him
from behind enemy lines. Officials said the pilot was in good
condition at Aviano Air Base in Italy and helping Air Force
investigators determine what disabled his aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's air attacks by U.S. and NATO aircraft broadened to
target Serb forces blamed for the atrocities, raised the risk to
NATO pilots but also increased the chance for slowing Yugoslavia's
ground offensive against the insurgent Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at an expanded set of targets and we're going to
go more intensively after some targets,'' said NATO Commander Gen.
Wesley Clark, a U.S. Army general.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO airstrikes were launched Wednesday after Milosevic, a
Serbian nationalist who presides over the Yugoslav republic,
refused to enter into a peace agreement with the majority ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, the largest Serb province. Serbia is the main
republic in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, U.N. officials report more than 500,000 ethnic
Albanians, about one-fourth of Kosovo's population, have been
driven from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Independent verification of information coming from Kosovo _ or
from other regions of Yugoslavia _ has become impossible in the
past week since foreign journalists have not been allowed into the
province.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia denied claims that paramilitary units under the
direction of Milosevic were committing genocide or ``ethnic
cleansing'' operations against ethnic Albanians who, before the
exodus, made up 90 percent of the population of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the unity of the 19-nation NATO alliance appeared to
soften Sunday as Portugal joined Italy and Greece in calling for an
early resumption of talks with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said his country had
``always been supportive of our allies and we understand the need
to intervene to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe.'' At the same
time, he said, ``any window of opportunity'' to restart talks on
the future of Kosovo should be seized.

EDITORIAL: WEEKEND OF PROGRESS IN NEW YORK CITY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, March 29:
</P>
<P>
   This past weekend, New Yorkers at last glimpsed the possibility
that some constructive change will come from the death of Amadou
Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir announced an overhaul of the
Street Crimes Unit, including more minority officers and closer
supervision. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani continued to meet with black
leaders and said he wished he had done so earlier. The
administration's steps signaled a welcome shift from defensiveness
to bridge-building and structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the leaders of the protests that have focused public
attention on the case produced a 10-point agenda for dealing with
police misconduct that the mayor should take as a reasonable basis
for future discussion. Among the recommendations Giuliani is most
likely to resist are those calling for an independent investigative
body with jurisdiction over police corruption and brutality issues
and a strengthened Civilian Complaint Review Board.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has long argued that police can best investigate
police. But the disturbing, detail-laden reports about police
harassment that have come from minority communities make it
apparent that the police need help policing themselves. The mayor
should accept the challenge of using his expertise to create an
investigative unit that works.
</P>
<P>
   Safir, for his part, has announced that he will move quickly to
put more minority officers in the Street Crimes Unit, and that unit
officers will now wear uniforms. That may make it more difficult
for the officers to operate. But men in plainclothes who suddenly
appear wielding guns and shouting orders can frighten innocent
civilians in ways that endanger both the civilians and the police,
especially when their targets do not understand English.
</P>
<P>
   The police have won the city's gratitude for their success in
reducing crime, but that achievement must be balanced with more
sensitivity to the complaints of citizens who feel the unpleasant
side of those efforts. The Street Crimes Unit operates mainly in
high-crime, minority neighborhoods, and there was always a danger
that its members would be seen as an occupying force bent on
harassing black and Hispanic men. The importance of not having this
mission performed by a virtually all-white unit seems obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani seems to be doing his best to demonstrate that he
really wants to develop better relationships with black leaders.
His challenge now is to follow through. What seemed to be an
equally serious attempt at bridge-building after the Abner Louima
case ended once the furor died down. It is imperative that Giuliani
not pass up this chance to establish a new understanding between
police and the minority community.

   LEADER'S RESIGNATION SPURS JOY IN PARAGUAY
</P>
<P>
   By JOHN OTIS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ASUNCION, Paraguay _ Shaken by violent protests and on the verge of
being removed from office, Paraguayan President Raul Cubas resigned
Sunday, setting off wild celebrations across this South American
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Senate leader Luis Gonzalez Macchi of the ruling Colorado Party
was sworn-in Sunday night as Paraguay's new president and
immediately received the backing by the country's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Caravans of jubilant motorists wound through the streets of the
Paraguayan capital of Asuncion, honking horns, singing the national
anthem and setting off fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best thing that could have happened to my
country,'' said Julian Ojeda, who waved a Paraguayan flag as he
celebrated with a huge crowd in front of the pink Congress building
in downtown Asuncion.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Sunday night, a somber Cubas said he was
being forced out by an unjust impeachment trial. But he said his
resignation would help bring peace to Paraguay after a wave of
anti-government protests left four people dead and more than 100
injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not leaving because I'm corrupt or a crook. I'm leaving
because, if my departure helps to pacify the nation, that will be
my contribution at this delicate moment,'' said Cubas, who was
flanked by his wife and several aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to be responsible for more bloodshed of
innocents. I have just signed my resignation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A broadcast by Radio Mitre of Buenos Aires, Argentina, reported
that Lino Oviedo, the cashiered army general whose release from
prison by Cubas last year touched off the nation's political
crisis, had been temporarily detained Sunday night in an airport on
the outskirts of Buenos Aires. The radio station reported that he
was carrying false documents.
</P>
<P>
   Oviedo had turned himself in to military authorities last week
but Paraguayan television reported that he had fled the country by
private aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Macchi said that after being sworn in he would return Oviedo to
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The downfall of Cubas, who served just seven months and three
days of a five-year term, capped one of the most violent weeks in
recent Paraguayan history.
</P>
<P>
   His government began unravelling on Tuesday when Vice President
Luis Argana was assassinated on the streets of Asuncion during rush
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Argana was leading the effort to impeach Cubas on the grounds
that he had violated the constitution by freeing Oviedo, a close
friend of Cubas who had received a 10-year jail sentence for
leading a failed coup attempt in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Although no evidence has emerged linking Oviedo and Cubas to the
slaying of Argana, both men were widely blamed for the crime. Angry
demonstrators clashed with riot police and army troops, who fought
back with tear gas, water canons, and rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
   They were the first major demonstrations in this normally
peaceful country of 5 million people since the dictatorship of
Alfredo Stroessner, who was ousted in a military coup in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time the country has seen such
mobilizations,'' said Oscar Denis, an opposition congressman. ``And
that gives strength to the politicians to follow the path of
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Cubas was impeached by the lower house of Congress on Wednesday,
a day after Argana was killed. Cubas' trial in the Senate was set
to resume today, and legislators said that they had enough votes to
remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Macchi received the presidential sash during a jubilant ceremony
before members of Congress. Afterward, legislators raised their
fists and shouted ``Long live Paraguay!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our struggle has not been in vain,'' Macchi said. ``The
Paraguayan people have won.''

U.S. WOMEN BURY MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM THOMAS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ If it could, the U.S. women's national team
would take Sunday's 3-0 victory over Mexico, put it in a container
and bury it like a time capsule under the Rose Bowl turf, with
instructions not to open until July 10, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On that date, if all goes according to the players' hopes and
most observers' predictions, USA will return here for the
championship match of Women's World Cup '99.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of soccer to play between now and then. The match
with Mexico was only the start of the U.S. team's nine-match ``Road
to Pasadena'' tour.
</P>
<P>
   But the victory was one to savor. It was one that, if they
could, the Americans gladly would put away for safekeeping, digging
out only when they need it most.
</P>
<P>
   Kristine Lilly would be the first to grab the shovel, but many
other players would wait to get their digs in. Lilly scored two
late goals within three minutes of each other, enabling the United
States to finally crack the Mexican defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the final result was a just result, even though they
were late goals,'' U.S. Coach Tony DiCicco said. ``It was an
excellent defensive effort by Mexico. I'm proud of the way our team
kept attacking, even if it sometimes meant we were left naked on
defense. We did a good job of getting back.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States outshot Mexico, 42-1, put 20 shots on goal and
possessed the ball for 70 percent of the match. All this, despite
Mexico's strategy to pack the front of its net, a ploy Coach
Leonardo Cuellar admitted was necessary to prevent an embarrassing
rout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew from the beginning that we expected to play the best
team in the world,'' Cuellar said.
</P>
<P>
   Eight U.S. players took shots in the first half alone, while
Mexico countered with only one, dangerous striker Maribel
Dominguez. Yet, if not for a brilliant leaping save by U.S.
goalkeeper Briana Scurry in the 19th minute, Dominguez would have
put her team on top, 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican goalkeeper Linnea Quinones was equal to the U.S.
challenge, making several outstanding saves. Until Lilly's late
outburst, the United States managed to get only one shot past
Quinones, a header by Julie Foudy off an assist by Shannon
MacMillan in the 38th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Quinones' finest moment was stopping Mia Hamm on a breakaway in
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``She made a tremendous save, one that I think defined her game
today,'' said Hamm, who assisted on Lilly's second goal in the 88th
minute.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm admitted to being a little frustrated at failing to score
Sunday after also being shut out in the recent Algarve Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a long layoff in the fall, it takes some time to get
back certain aspects of the game,'' Hamm said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked to score, but we didn't need me to. If I
score a goal, I want it to be when it will help my team win.''
</P>
<P>
   That opportunity could come if the United States returns to the
Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the first game of our season. The World Cup is the
postseason,'' DiCicco said. ``We want to get everybody ready for
the World Cup, because we intend to be back here on July 10.'' &QL;

THIS TIME, IT WILL BE FOR ALL THE MARBLES

 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ A time will come in Monday's National
Collegiate Athletic Association championship game when Duke's point
guard, William Avery, will try to penetrate Connecticut's defense
and the polished floor at Tropicana Field will feel like torn-up
blacktop; when Avery will find the Huskies' premier defender, Ricky
Moore, closing in on his personal space. Then, they will replay the
childhood showdowns from Oak Park in Augusta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Avery, the sophomore, will try a move to get to the
basket and Moore, the senior, will recognize it as something he
taught him back when Avery was just leaving eighth grade and Moore
started dragging him along to pickup games. Perhaps then, on
college basketball's biggest stage, the boys who grew up a block
apart on Hazel Street in the Sand Hill neighborhood of Augusta will
take the game that has bound them together to its logical zenith.
</P>
<P>
   Although Duke is the favorite to win the title, it is Moore,
arguably the finest perimeter defender in the nation, who has the
advantage. ``I took him under my wing,'' Moore said. ``He was
younger than I was, so I was the teacher. Some of the moves he
makes, I do. He's gotten stronger and quicker, and my role is
different. I don't think Will has seen a defender like me all year.
It's going to be tough for him to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   That was no disrespect. Moore and Avery smiled when they
reminisced about their days at Oak Park, playing pickup games with
guys from 15 to 45 years old, getting banged into the parking lot
if they tried to dunk. They delighted in the idea that the young
boys who used to walk to the playground together _ only to get on
opposing teams when they arrived _ would face off for a prize they
could scarcely imagine when the Reynolds brothers, local legends,
were doing crazy things to rule the court.
</P>
<P>
   Avery and Moore have not talked much recently, their travel
schedules making it difficult for them to find each other. They
have not played an organized game together in nearly four years,
since Moore was a high school senior, Avery was a sophomore, and
Westside High went 33-1 and won a state championship with Moore at
the point averaging about 23 points, showcasing an offensive game
he has since set aside. But Moore's influence lingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really looked up to him,'' Avery said. ``I can remember in
junior high I wanted to get the same number he wore. I even tried
to model my game after him for a little while. Definitely he feels
he has the advantage. He probably does. Some of my moves I got from
him. If anybody knows my game, he does.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That is because Moore's game was once so similar. But Khalid
El-Amin's arrival in Storrs, Conn., two years ago forced an
uncomplaining Moore to abandon the point and become a defensive
specialist. With suffocating closeness, he makes it nearly
impossible for his man to get off a shot. Even Moore did not know
Sunday who he would guard, but Coach Jim Calhoun has repeatedly
said he likes Moore to chop the head off the dragon.
</P>
<P>
   Avery makes Duke go, but if Moore guards him, it leaves El-Amin
to give up almost half a foot to guard Trajan Langdon. Forward
Kevin Freeman compared Duke to a Cyclops with many eyes, and it is
likely Moore will find himself combating almost all of them Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter who I'm guarding,'' Moore said. ``I'm going
to go out and cause havoc.''
</P>
<P>
   In the national semifinal, Moore neutralized Ohio State's point
guard, Scoonie Penn, pushing him further and further out of his
comfort zone with in-his-shirt defense and holding Penn to 11
points on 3-of-13 shooting. Michigan State's Mateen Cleaves got
just six points on 2-of-15 shooting in December against Moore, and
Arthur Lee of Stanford had 12 points on 4-of-13 shooting in
February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he's like any kid I've coached because he
doesn't really only guard a point,'' Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski
said. ``He guards anybody on the perimeter.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore suspects that the folks from Sand Hill will be together
someplace watching Monday and that the trash talking has already
begun. Surely, when they are back on that beat-up court this
summer, Avery and Moore will reprise this game. But there is no
time for pleasantries now. The defender will play his man, even if
it is his boyhood friend, like all the others _ closely and
mercilessly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to speak after the game,'' Moore said. ``We're
enemies right now.''

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ He likes his players to be well-rounded.
Everyone can handle the ball; everyone can pass; everyone can run
the floor and play defense.
<TEXT>

   That's part of what makes Mike Krzyzewski's Duke teams special,
part of why the Blue Devils for so long have been a fixture on
college basketball's biggest stages.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, the kids get a little carried away. A day
after watching center Elton Brand flirt with disaster in Saturday

it all.

   So don't look for the Blue Devils' 6-8, 260-pound sophomore to
be attempting any Magic Johnson-style coast-to-coast rushes in
tonight's national championship game against Connecticut at
Tropicana Field. You might, however, look for the consensus player
of the year to do just about everything else to keep the Huskies
occupied.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Elton Brand, he's the center of all they do, in all
senses,'' UConn coach Jim Calhoun said. ``We're going to have to
make some decisions on how we're going to double him, where it's
going to come from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, he's the most valuable player in college
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Brand looked the part against Michigan State before
picking up his fourth foul on a charging call when he ran over a
courageous Mateen Cleaves with more than 10 minutes remaining. Even
with a five-minute exile to the bench to contemplate the perils of
youthful exuberance, Brand still finished with 18 points and 15
rebounds as Duke (37-1) moved on to its sixth national title game
in the Krzyzewski era in search of a third championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was giving us these facial expressions, like, `Give me the
ball! They can't guard me!''' point guard William Avery said. ``Our
guys get energy from that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils hope to be equally invigorated tonight. Asked if
he was worried that Brand might feel pressure to do too much in
this one, Krzyzewski smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to take on as much of a role as possible,'' he
said. ``And I hope that Connecticut will allow him to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   While the 33-2 Huskies match up well in some areas in this title
showdown, center is not one of them. UConn has size in 6-11 Jake
Voskuhl, the Katy resident and former Strake Jesuit star, but Brand
brings a package of quickness, a nice short-range scoring touch and
brute force to the confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had encountered a big man who could match that
quickness, Brand thought for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' he said, then added a smile. ``I guess I'm
being cocky a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   No harm intended, a fellow sophomore insists. Just the big guy
having a little fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elton is a tiger on the court and a teddy bear away from it,''
forward Shane Battier says.
</P>
<P>
   Voskuhl won't be seeing much of the stuffed animal part of
Brand's makeup tonight. Nor will he be expected to tame the tiger
alone. He will get help inside from forward Kevin Freeman and
probably others. And if that doesn't work well, who says second
place is so bad?
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to see what they do on defense,'' Brand said.
``Hopefully, we'll be able to exploit that.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the year, Brand wasn't demanding quite so much
respect. Coming back from a freshman season in which he missed 15
consecutive games after breaking his left foot in practice, he
nevertheless was a preseason All-American, mentioned for all the
major awards. Duke-watchers already were speculating that he might
become the first player of the Krzyzewski era to leave school
before completing four years.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of all the hype and questions about his future,
Brand struggled early. Still not in top shape, he grabbed only
three rebounds in a Dec. 2 victory over Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   After an overall so-so start culminated with a 6-of-15 shooting
line and six rebounds in 23 foul-plagued minutes against Florida,
Brand was lifted from the starting lineup and came off the bench
the next two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Elton was put in a situation that's going to happen
every once in a while now with so many kids going (pro) early,''
Krzyzewski recalls. ``Kids are going to be given recognition based
on the promise of what they can do, not because of what they've
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Elton's case, because he didn't play much the year before
because of injury, he already was given a lot of recognition. It's
easy for all of us to fall into the trap that, `We're OK now. This
is who I am. This is all I need to be.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He just needed to be reminded that he wasn't that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't any stern talk. It was more, `You're not in the
shape you need to be in. You're not attacking it to the level you
need to be. You're playing pretty well, but you've got the talent
to be better than that. God gave you more talent than what you've
shown, and here's how to make use of it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The first Michigan State game helped underscore the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, Elton turned his whole season around,'' Battier
says. ``He was embarrassed by that performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night _ before moonlighting at the point _ Brand was
doing most of the embarrassing. A good start tonight could force
Connecticut to choose between being beaten inside or leaving the
perimeter open to the likes of Battier, Trajan Langdon, William
Avery and Chris Carrawell _ all of whom can make the 3 or put the
ball on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question Jim Calhoun will have something to try to
take Elton out of the game,'' Krzyzewski said.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Brand vows not to help by taking himself out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really foul that much,'' he said. ``I only had seven
before in the whole Tournament. That was unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's questions were not. The issue of bolting for NBA
millions _ perhaps as the top pick in the draft _ remained in the
air, and Brand did little to put the issue to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if a victory tonight would leave him with ``nothing left''
to accomplish, he noted that ``Another national championship would
be something to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of why others haven't left early before him, he
was just as vague.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach K keeps you improving each year,'' he said. ``And some
of those players didn't have to take care of their families. They
were pretty well off.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Brand says, he is planning to return, which
automatically would make the Blue Devils the team to beat next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to believe sometimes,'' he said. ``I read some of
the articles, and it's like I'm reading about a different person.''
</P>
<P>
   So far in this championship stretch run, Elton Brand has lived
up to the hype. If he can persuade himself to leave the driving to
someone else, he may be sifting through even more good reviews by
Tuesday morning.

 &HT;    Man dies in robbery in front of son, 12
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Latoya Anderson had just said goodbye to
Mark B. Williams, turned and walked about 50 feet toward her
apartment when a loud pop cracked the Sunday afternoon calm and she
heard it: ``My daddy, my daddy!''
</P>
<P>
   That quick, Williams, 32, sitting in his car with his
12-year-old son outside Anderson's Westgate apartment, was shot
dead in an apparent robbery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned around, and when I turned, they were pushing him out
of the truck,'' said Anderson, 22, who'd stood outside the car
talking to Williams for about 15 minutes. Lematre Williams ``was
standing out the truck. He was shocked. He was like, `My daddy, my
daddy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe two men approached Williams' maroon Nissan
Pathfinder outside 4680 Myla Lane in suburban West Palm Beach just
after 3 p.m., demanded his jewelry and opened fire, killing him
with a single shot. After pushing Williams' body out, the men sped
off in the Nissan, driving several blocks, where they ditched the
car in a canal.
</P>
<P>
   For the next two hours, Palm Beach County sheriff's deputies
using police dogs and the sheriff's office Eagle helicopter
searched a 2-square-mile area for the men. They came up
empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Powell, who was working on his car in front of
Anderson's apartment building, said Williams had a brief
conversation with his killers before the shot was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, whose most recent address was unavailable Sunday, made
regular visits to the apartment where Anderson lived with his
estranged wife, Jennifer Williams, 27.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, married for six years, separated last year but still
spoke every day, Jennifer Williams said. Her husband had four
children, including Lematre, nicknamed ''Biscuit,'' from another
marriage and worked at the Solid Waste Authority, Williams said.
Williams was in the shower when Anderson ran inside screaming that
Mark had been shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran out and he was on the ground still breathing. I tried to
give him CPR,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour afterwards, Williams' mother, Beverly Oats, 49,
arrived, was shown the body of her only child and collapsed in the
arms of relatives. She declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe that, after the men drove away, one was
dropped off while the other continued to Cherry Road and drove into
the canal.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, deputies thought one of the killers might have been
trapped in the car.
</P>
<P>
   But county divers searched the car and canal and didn't find
anyone.Jenny Staletovich writes for the Palm Beach Post, West Palm
Beach, Fla.

CHAPMAN'S SORE TOE LANDS HIM ON SIDELINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Rex Chapman's disappointing season with the Suns took
another twist Sunday when the club placed him on the injured list
because of a toe injury that apparently happened during a game
against the Los Angeles Lakers last week.
</P>
<P>
   The club did not immediately activate a player, indicating it is
possible the club will attempt to sign someone. Guard Marko Milic
and center Horacio Llamas are also on the injured list. Milic could
play. Llamas is in a foot cast after having surgery on his
Achilles' tendon.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman has had nagging injuries all season, including a
hamstring strain at the start of the season and a bruised calf. He
has missed five games because of injuries, and he was ejected from
a game in Portland, then suspended one game for bumping referee
Scott Foster while protesting the call.
</P>
<P>
   Players placed on the injured list must miss at least five
games. Counting Sunday night's game against the Portland Trail
Blazers, Chapman could not return until an April 7 game at America
West Arena between the Suns and Minnesota Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't want it,'' Suns Coach Danny Ainge said of the
decision to place Chapman on the list. ``We just don't want him to
try coming back too soon. That foot has been bothering him, and he
needs to get it well.''
</P>
<P>
   A shooter who relies considerably upon his legs, Chapman has
struggled all season. He is shooting 34 percent overall and 34
percent from three-point range. He came off the bench for three
games and had mixed success in that role.
</P>
<P>
   After playing two seasons for the minumum allowed for a veteran
player and leading the club in scoring last season, Chapman was
rewarded with a new six-year contract before the season began.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman said the large toe on his left foot began bothering him
earlier in the season, but wasn't serious enough to keep him from
playing. He apparently aggravated the toe during the game against
the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been bothering me for a couple of weeks,'' he said. ``It
really started to what I would say hurting in Los Angeles. In the
Portland game, it felt awful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one of those things that, with our schedule this
year, it isn't going to get better if I continue to play with it.
I've got to take a few days off and it will get better, I hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a player, you don't ever want to be on (the list). I guess
it's probably the best thing right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Chapman has a history of injury-shortened NBA seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just part of it,'' he said. ``Obviously, I want to be
healthy all the time. It's just not possible right now. I just have
to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no sense dwelling on it, or over analyzing it. I have
to play, and be a professional, do my job. That's what I'm here
for.'' &QL;

PLAYOFF CLINCHER AWAITS COYOTES  
 STARS INDIFFERENT ABOUT OWN STATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ After he came within a whisker of
recording a franchise record eighth shutout of the season last week
against Los Angeles, Coyotes goalie Nikolai Khabibulin shrugged off
his 37-save, star of the game performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice, I guess,'' he said. ``But it'll mean more in the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   On the same night, Keith Tkachuk hit the 30-goal mark for the
fourth straight season and the fifth time in his career. Like
Khabibulin, he wasn't impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty? Big deal,'' the left wing said. ``All I'm thinking
about is the playoffs and getting out of the first round.''
</P>
<P>
   Even newcomer Robert Reichel, who has been electrifying since
joining the team in a trade a week ago Saturday with the New York
Islanders, isn't getting caught up in his own achievements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to score and contribute right away when you come to
a new team, but what really matters is how you do once the playoffs
start,'' said Reichel, who has four goals in four games, including
game winners in the Coyotes' past two.
</P>
<P>
   It's been that kind of focus and non-celebratory approach from
the entire team that has helped the Coyotes dig themselves out from
the hole they put themselves in back in February. Since losing 11
of 13 games, they have lost only once in their past eight (5-1-2).
</P>
<P>
   If the Coyotes (36-25-12) stay hot long enough to thump the
last-place Vancouver Canucks (21-41-11) at 8 tonight at General
Motors Place, maybe they'll learn to crack a smile. A victory will
guarantee Phoenix a playoff spot, something that virtually has been
assured for weeks but is not yet official.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes' first-round oppo nent, meanwhile, is far from set
in stone. Entering the weekend, just four points separated the
three teams still in the battle for the fifth playoff spot behind
Phoenix. Anaheim has been staying just ahead of St. Louis. San Jose
has been charging hard. Any of them could meet the Coyotes when the
postseason begins either April 21 or 22.
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask them whom they'd prefer to play. They'll tell you it
doesn't matter. San Jose and Anaheim have given them problems for
different reasons. The Coyotes probably match up better against the
Blues, but a couple of players said they'd like another shot at the
Mighty Ducks, who knocked them out of the first round two years ago
in a seventh game in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just happy we're getting things rolling again,''
All-Star defenseman Teppo Numminen said. ``I think we're starting
to get back to the level we were at the start of the season (20-6-4
at one point).
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell right now that our confidence is coming back, and
good things are starting to happen again. Those are things we can
build on. You build on small things, and big things can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   A playoff-clinching victory would be another step in the right
direction for a franchise that hasn't won a first-round series
since 1987, when General Manager Bobby Smith was playing for the
Montreal Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   Smith gave them a major boost by trading for Reichel, seizing on
what he could tell was an upward momentum already started by the
team. He also added needed backup relief for Khabibulin by trading
for Mikhail Shtalenkov after Jimmy Waite's game went south. And he
provided depth with the additions of defensemen Stan Neckar, Jamie
Huscroft and, before them, J.J. Daigneault.
</P>
<P>
   But Reichel was the move that may have put them over the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a second-line center that's been in the NHL a
long time and can score points,'' Tkachuk said. ``You need two
solid lines for when it counts _ in the playoffs _ and now we've
got that.'' &QL;

MENTOR GOES AGAINST STUDENT

<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Duke's  &UR; William Avery said Connecticut's
 &UR; Ricky Moore taught him a lot. Moore hopes it wasn't too much.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, a senior guard whose reputation as an outstanding
defender rose a few more notches when he shut down Ohio State's
 &UR; Scoonie Penn on Saturday, and Avery, a sophomore point guard who
has developed into an exciting offensive player, grew up in
Augusta, Ga.; lived on the same street; and played on the same high
school basketball team for two years.
</P>
<P>
   The two are expected to match up with each other during at least
part of tonight's NCAA championship game at Tropicana Field.
</P>
<P>
   As kids, Moore took Avery ``under my wing,'' he said. ``I was
the teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery said when he was in junior high, he wanted to wear the No.
21 Moore wore in football and basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he did a great job showing me what path to take,''
Avery said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody looked up to him in the community. I really looked
up to him. I even tried to model my game after him for a little
while.''
</P>
<P>
   When Avery was a sophomore and Moore a senior at Westside High
School, they led the basketball team to a 33-1 record and the
school's first Class AAA state title. Avery later transferred to
Oak Hill Academy in Virginia to improve his academic standing so he
could get into Duke.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being prep teammates, they spent a lot of time
playing hoops at a rundown park in Augusta. Their biggest
adversaries at the park weren't each other, but the notorious
Reynolds brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would do everything to win,'' said Moore, whose 133 games
played is the most in UConn history. ``I remember I'd go up to dunk
and find myself in the parking lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore and Avery haven't talked since they arrived here last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're enemies right now,'' Moore said. ``We're gonna speak
after the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery said he wants to show Moore ``that I'm just as good if not
better, that he taught me too well.''
</P>
<P>
   The eye has it
</P>
<P>
   When talking about Moore's defensive ability, UConn Coach  &UR; Jim
Calhoun likes to say that Moore ``cuts the head off the dragon.''
With that in mind, Huskies forward  &UR; Kevin Freeman was asked which
Duke player represents the head of the dragon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a head of a dragon (tonight),'' Freeman
said. ``I just think it's a big cyclops, and you've got to try to
take the eye out of him and beat them, the entire team. You just
can't take the head off.''
</P>
<P>
   Foul performance
</P>
<P>
   A good foul-shooting team, Duke was an uncharacteristically poor
14 of 27 from the line in its 68-62 win over Michigan State in
Saturday's national semifinal in the vast confines of Tropicana
Field. Forward  &UR; Chris Carrawell was 6 of 12, and even guard  &UR; Trajan
Langdon, who has made more than 84 percent of his free throws,
missed the front end of a one-and-one.
</P>
<P>
   But Duke Coach  &UR; Mike Krzyzewski doesn't think it will be a
problem tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've shot free throws all year, so we're just gonna go up to
the line as confident as we've been,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Carrawell, ``I take some of the blame for that. I made some
big ones, but I also missed a lot. But when Trajan missed the front
end of the one-and-one, I didn't feel so bad. I blame it on the
background.'' &QL; 
Down on Duke
</P>
<P>
   Duke sophomore  &UR; Shane Battier said he remembered  &UR; Christian
 &UR; Laettner's overtime basket that enabled Duke to beat UConn in the
1990 East Regional that sent the Blue Devils to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   But Battier, who grew up in Birmingham, Mich., wasn't exactly
happy about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, I was pretty sick,'' he said. ``I was a
huge Michigan fan and as anti-Duke as anyone you could find. I
hated Duke, I hated  &UR; Grant Hill, I hated Mike Krzyzewski.''
</P>
<P>
   Battier has since changed his mind. &QL;

GREEN-FLAG PIT STOP COSTLY TO BOAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DEWAYNE SMITH  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - There were two hometown boys in Sunday's MCI WorldCom
200 Indy Racing League contest at Phoenix International Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   Both led the race, but Phoenix-born Eddie Cheever Jr., whose
family moved him to Europe at a young age, crashed.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Valley native and Glendale resident Billy
Boat placed fourth.
</P>
<P>
   But despite a no-show in the victory circle and a pit strategy
that went awry, Boat is pleased with how his day ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a pretty good car today,'' Boat said of his A.J.
Foyt-owned Oldsmobile Aurora-powered Dallara ride. ``It was
handling well _ I really can't complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, our qualifying setup wasn't very good, so we had to
start in the 12th row. Normally, it seems we do it the other way
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being in the top five, however, is the kind of finish we want
to see. We're looking for consistency. Last year we were on the
hook (crashed) way too often.''
</P>
<P>
   Boat, who picked up $71,700 for his effort, worked his way up
through most of the 27-car starting field and inherited the lead on
the 99th circuit following a yellow-flag session for a crash.
</P>
<P>
   He then led the field until Lap 128, when he pitted under green
for tires and fuel and then never got close enough again to worry
the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were going to have to pit, so we took on tires and
fuel on the chance the race would stay green,'' said the
33-year-old Boat whose car owner Foyt is a four-time Indianapolis
500 winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually we were hoping for a caution period so we could pit,
but that didn't show up so we took our chances during green. And
then the race didn't stay green, so we didn't get either one.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's race was the IRL's second of the season. In the opener,
January 24 at Walt Disney World Speedway, Boat placed ninth.
</P>
<P>
   He now heads to Charlotte, N.C., to prepare for the season's
next outing May 1. Then he's on to the Texas Motor Speedway and
Indianapolis Motor Speedway for testing before the famed
Indianapolis 500 May 30.
</P>
<P>
   Boat's teammate, Sweden-born Kenny Brack, didn't fare as well,
although he started a row ahead of Boat.
</P>
<P>
   Brack got caught up in a three-car tussle on Lap 47 that also
involved Steve Knapp of Salem, Wis., and Raul Boesel of Curitiba,
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The damage was too great for Brack and Knapp to return to the
oval battle, but Boesel lasted another 100 laps before low oil
pressure ended his day.
</P>
<P>
   Boat, who came up through the dirt track racing ranks to the
Indy-type cars, has competed in 17 IRL races during the past three
years, with one win, and has been fastest qualifier seven times.
His victory came at Texas Motor Speedway last season.
</P>
<P>
   He also won the pole position and led the first 12 laps of last
year's Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   Boat, who set a record of 11 straight wins in the U.S. Auto Club
Western States midget series in 1995, is used to coming from behind
to win, but he just ran out of time Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   An Arizona State University graduate, Boat lives in Glendale
with his wife, Andrea, and four children.
</P>
<P>
   He owns B&AMP;B Fabrication, a metal fabrication/welding shop that
specializes in exhaust systems for high-performance automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, Boat said he thought his finish had been a good one
for the hometown fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our pit strategy had worked, we would have been heroes,''
said Boat. ``I was a little disappointed after qualifying, but it
is the race that counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, it's great to finish.'' &QL;

TANGLE PUTS RAY IN 21ST

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX -  &UR; Greg Ray, cat-quick on Saturday after grabbing the
MCI WorldCom 200 pole position at Phoenix International Raceway,
fared much worse a day later.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, who never led, finished 21st after he and  &UR; John Paul Jr.
tangled on Lap 94 while battling for position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if John Paul had tire problems or got into the
dirt, but he braked way too quickly, and we had nowhere to go,''
Ray said. ``I couldn't get on the brakes quick enough. (I) was
faster than (winner)  &UR; Scott Goodyear.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul, who appeared to be angered by the incident, said he had
drifted high on the track and was attempting to make a correction
when impact was made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got up in the marbles and out of the throttle,'' Paul said.
``Greg never checked up and slid into me.''
</P>
<P>
   Then each driver slid right out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Paul was consoled by an invited guest, Chicago Cubs
home run king  &UR; Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't take it to heart,'' Sosa told Paul. ``It happens to me
all the time. I have had bad games, but I don't let them get to
me.'' &QL; 
Oh Canada &QL;

race, leading all 50 laps.  &UR; Paul Marciano of Glendale was 20th. &QL;

By finishing third,  &UR; Robbie Buhl gave the Infiniti engine its
second-best finish in IRL history.  &UR; Scott  &UR; Harrington also finished
fifth with an Infiniti, only the second time the motor has powered
two drivers to top-five finishes in the same race.
</P>
<P>
   The third Infiniti driver was  &UR; Roberto Guerrero, who was 16th
following an accident on Lap 160.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like (the Infiniti engine) is there,'' Infiniti
executive Frank Honsowetz said. &QL;

Sorry, but  &UR; Buzz Calkins is not your average racer.

   Calkins is a University of Colorado graduate, earning a

</P>
<P>
   Now he's attending the prestigious Kellogg School of Management
at Northwestern, where he plans to obtain a master's degree in
business administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to catch the red-eye (Sunday),'' Calkins said. ``My
first class is at 9 (a.m. today).'' &QL; 
Pit stops &QL;

Irwindale (Calif.) Speedway, where he won the racetrack's inaugural

<P>
   &UR; Jim Guthrie, who won at PIR two years ago, is without a ride
and watched the race from the press tower, where he was auditioning
for Fox Sports Net.

   Despite eight accidents, including a hard whack taken by  &UR; Kenny
 &UR; Brack against the outer wall along the front straightaway on Lap
47, no one was seriously hurt. &QL;

RODMAN WORMS WAY BACK INTO LINEUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Having closed the latest perplexing chapter in
Dennis Rodman's wild and whimsical tour with the Lakers, coach Kurt
Rambis put him right back in the starting lineup Sunday. Not
without reservations, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the ideal situation,'' Rambis said, ``but we had a
long conversation and hopefully we have rectified any of the
problems we would have in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman made his first start of the season Friday against
Sacramento, then did everything possible to show himself unworthy
of the privilege. He refused to re-enter the game in the fourth
quarter, and the next day, he blew off practice.
</P>
<P>
   Only a discussion with general manager Mitch Kupchak and a
30-minute heart-to-heart with Rambis saved him from an uncertain
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've come to an understanding that he's an important
part of this ballclub and we need him to make a more concerted
effort to be a part of this team,'' Rambis said. ``To be at
practice, team meetings, be on time, all of those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman's talents are clearly needed _ he had 12 rebounds and
seven points Sunday against the Knicks _ but Rambis also hesitated
to change the starting lineup again. The Lakers have used 11
different combinations in 31 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get players situated and get ourselves in a
nice groove so that we're playing our best ball going into the
playoffs,'' Rambis said.
</P>
<P>
   Just kidding: Days after ripping Patrick Ewing in a national
publication, Shaquille O'Neal faced him on the court. But
amazingly, in a game in which fists and elbows were flying, the two
hulking centers did not engage in mortal combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't make any comments. I don't care what people say,''
Ewing said.
</P>
<P>
   And O'Neal pulled his usual about-face, saying his verbal attack
was nothing more than salesmanship, what Shaq calls ``home-boy
marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick's a great player, probably one of the greatest players
ever to play the game,'' he said. ``I'm a marketeer, I knew what I
was saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Rotation roulette: Backup center Sean Rooks, who was upset after
not playing the past two games, expressed dismay with his situation
before tipoff, then found his way back into the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Rooks played nine minutes, while J.R. Reid, who had been playing
backup center, sat out the entire game. Travis Knight, until two
games ago a starting forward, did not play for the second straight
game.
</P>
<P>
   Food for the Worm: Lakers broadcaster Chick Hearn had the best
line of the day concerning Rodman. Presiding over a halftime
presentation in which a contest winner got to be a ``Laker for a
day'' and signed a ``contract,'' Hearn told 17-year-old Andy
Runyon, ``One thing about the contract _ you've gotta be on time
for practice and you can't miss any games.''

from a back-room pharmacy before he started seeing a doctor at a

in the back room was at least half as expensive as going to a
regular clinic. If he has to stop going to the hospital clinic, he
says he will return to the back rooms. ``I will have no choice,''

articulate, impassioned gadfly as director of the Balkan Action
Council, one of the countless independent pressure groups that nip

CHANGES IN STREET CRIME UNIT MAY HURT ITS EFFECTIVENESS  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS lede to change ``END'' to ``OVERHAUL''; no other changes.)  (rk) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As officers in the Street Crime Unit reported _ in
uniform _ for duty Sunday, many law enforcement officials said that
Police Commissioner Howard Safir's decision to overhaul the unit's
plain-clothes operations would make it less controversial, but also
less effective.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with mounting criticism in the seven weeks since the
Amadou Diallo killing, Safir announced Friday that he would require
Street Crime Unit officers to work in uniform and that he would
replace 50 members of the overwhelmingly white unit with minority
officers.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would try to attract candidates by elevating the
unit's status with promotions and annual raises of $1,500, and by
making the assignment part of a career path leading to the
prestigious detective bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Those moves may ease the criticism from those city residents who
charge that the Street Crimes Unit has produced impressive arrest
and gun seizure statistics by being too aggressive and infringing
on the civil rights of residents in minority neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But tactically, the new dress code that began last night will
deprive the unit of one of its most valuable weapons _ stealth _
and will limit the squad's ability to perform surveillance in
high-crime neighborhoods, officers and former commanders said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the changes said they amounted to tampering with a
proven formula. During the last five years, the Street Crimes Unit
has functioned as a kind of rapid deployment force, a platoon of
gung-ho officers dispatched to high-crime neighborhoods with a
mandate to aggressively search for illegal guns and violent felons.
</P>
<P>
   The unit's results were so impressive _ it makes up less than 2
percent of the police force but confiscated 40 percent of all the
illegal weapons seized in the city _ that Safir tripled its
manpower from 130 to nearly 400 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Former Deputy Inspector Richard F. Savage, who was relieved of
his command of the Street Crimes Unit when he opposed Safir's
expansion plans in 1997, said the changes would prevent officers
from posing as decoys in areas where a mugger or rapist had been
carrying out a series of attacks. Savage said the uniform
requirement would also force officers to be more careful when they
approach people suspected of carrying weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still going to be looking for people with the bulge in
the waistband and the heavy pockets, and they're still going to pop
out of the car when they see someone who's wanted or who may be
carrying a weapon,'' Savage said. ``But in the past, they could
have parked the car, maybe gone around the block and found the
safest way to approach the situation. Now, the minute they leave
the vehicle, the bad guys immediately know who they are, and the
cops don't know who they're dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   Det. Terrance Wansley, a spokesman for the group 100 Blacks in
Law Enforcement, and other black officers said that the decision to
make the unit more racially diverse is so long overdue that it will
do little to change the suspicion that its officers and many
residents of minority neighborhoods feel toward each other.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Diallo shooting, the department has ordered every
member of the Street Crimes Unit to attend racial sensitivity
classes, which have been taught by a community affairs sergeant who
is also a member of 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant, who discussed the meetings on the condition of
anonymity, said they were surprisingly tense, marred by icy stares
and in one case a shouting match, leaving black officers stunned by
the depth of the alienation that some street crimes officers
expressed toward minority residents and their black and Latino
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's such deep racial divisions in that unit, that it's
going to take a lot more than just throwing a few raisins into the
milk bowl to change things,'' said Eric Adams, the president of 100
Blacks in Law Enforcement.

 &HT;    NCAA Women's Championship notebook: Matchup freshens spotlight
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Duke and Purdue have given women's basketball
a nice jump start into the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Parity long has been a buzzword in the sport, though with
Tennessee reaching the national championship game four consecutive
years and winning it three times, it was starting to sound hollow.
</P>
<P>
   No more.
</P>
<P>
   The Duke-Purdue final Sunday night produced not only a new
champion, but a first-time champion. Georgia coach Andy Landers,
among others, finds having new teams in the spotlight to be
refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   Landers said programs such as Connecticut and Tennessee have
helped women's basketball because of the interest they generated
with the media. But it hurts the sport, he said, if the marquee
names are the only ones that win.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want teams, you don't want players, you don't want
coaches becoming more popular or bigger than the game,'' said
Landers, whose team lost to Duke in the national semifinals. ``You
see that in the NBA, and sometimes it turns out not to be a pretty
picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``So us being able to beat other teams from time to time, I
think helps our sport.''
</P>
<P>
   That happened this season. Tennessee and Connecticut didn't even
make the Final Four, even though Tennessee returned all its stars
and Connecticut had the nation's best recruiting class.
</P>
<P>
   Duke defeated Tennessee in the East Regional final and
Connecticut lost in the Mideast semifinals to Iowa State, which had
won only one NCAA Tournament game before this season. Stanford, a
two-time national champion, lost to Maine in the first round this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of talent and women who can play the game,''
Purdue coach Carolyn Peck said. ``That will help evolve the
interest in women's basketball even more.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more good teams because more good players are coming
up. Thousands of high school girls play on summer teams, giving
them a chance to develop their skills and be seen by the hordes of
college coaches who attend those events.
</P>
<P>
   The young players see the increased attention the college game
is receiving and they also know that with the advent of the WNBA,
they can play beyond college. So they work even harder to get
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``With that in mind, you are able to feed a lot more than 10
Division I programs,'' Old Dominion coach Wendy Larry said. ``In
the '70s, with all due respect, there were probably 10 programs
that, year in and year out, would collect the best talent in the
high schools and then compete for national titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the talent pool has grown significantly, it's
becoming a time of parity.''

 &HT;    Duke loses title to Purdue
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Women's college basketball has a new national
champion, but the methods by which Purdue defeated Duke 62-45
Sunday night are not likely to be remembered for their brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   In a sloppy display of basketball that started out badly and
grew worse before a San Jose Arena sellout crowd of 17,709, both
teams were defensive-minded, as they had been doing throughout the
NCAA Tournament in holding opponents to under 60 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   But they also played extremely tight offensively, with horrible
shooting, a pile of turnovers (20 by Duke alone) and poor execution
the norm. Purdue's last field goal came with 5:08 to play, while
Duke went cold for three very critical minutes. The Boilermakers
converted 15 of 17 free throw attempts, turning a close 47-42 game
into a rout from the stripe.
</P>
<P>
   Duke was hoping to complete the front end of a double national
championship run by both its men's and women's teams. But Purdue
instead becomes the first Big 10 women's team to win an NCAA title.
</P>
<P>
   It took Purdue senior guard Ukari Figgs to loosen up play in the
second half. After a scoreless first half, she hit the first two
shots in the first minute on her way to an 18-point game and Final
Four MVP honors.
</P>
<P>
   Camille Cooper and Katie Douglas scored 13 and Stephanie
White-McCarty added 12 for Purdue (34-1), which closes the season
with a 32-game winning streak. Michele VanGorp had 15 for Duke
(29-7). Purdue shot 38.2 percent for the game, while Duke hit only
32.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When Figgs drove around VanGorp and in for a layup with 12:57 to
play, it gave Purdue at 32-20 lead, the first for the Boilermakers
since the early going. It grew to 38-31 when Camille Cooper scored
in the paint. Duke, whose starting guards have been so lethal
throughout the NCAA Tournament, were silent virtually the entire
game, the victim of Purdue's tough zone defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils also limited Purdue's dangerous perimeter game
for a while, but Figgs, White-McCarty and Douglas found enough room
to operate to keep Duke at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Another jumper by Figgs with 9:33 remaining pushed Purdue out to
a 40-31 advantage, but Duke's Nicole Erickson answered right back
with a 3-point shot. Then VanGorp hit two buckets down low before
Douglas unloaded a three from the left wing for a 45-38 score at
the 6:48 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Duke closed to 47-42 with 4:10 remaining when Hilary Howard
nailed a 3-pointer with White-McCarty on the other end of the
floor, agonizing in pain with an ankle injury. She would not
return, but those also would be Duke's final points until the final
minute of play.
</P>
<P>
   The teams set an NCAA title game record with the fewest points
in the first half, as Duke led 22-17 despite 11 turnovers and 39
percent shooting. Purdue was even worse, making only 28.6 percent
of its shots.

EX-OFFICIAL AT U.S. EMBASSY IN CHINA VIO LATED RULES IN ACCEPTING
FA VORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHONEIX _ A former official at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing
repeatedly violated State Department rules by accepting favors from
a large corporation owned by the Chinese government, ``The Arizona
Republic'' has learned.
</P>
<P>
   When Charles M. Parish Jr. accepted free lodging at corporate
apartments in Las Vegas and Norwalk, Calif., in 1995 and 1996, he
was in charge of the visa section at the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   In that position he provided visa assistance to Elizabeth Mann,
a Chinese-born Phoenix woman who is an executive with a corporation
directed by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade.
</P>
<P>
   That corporation, COFCO, owns the new Chinese Cultural Center on
44th Street.
</P>
<P>
   While COFCO has not been tied to allegations that Chinese
government money was used to influence the 1996 U.S. elections, the
Parish story illustrates the same underlying issue _ the potential
vulnerability of government officials to foreign interests.
</P>
<P>
   Parish's free stays at the Chinese-owned properties in 1995 and
1996 were forbidden by the State Department's Standards of Conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Those standards prohibit taking ``gifts, favors, entertainment
or loans'' from ``anyone who is seeking official action'' from the
State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Parish, 52, acknowledges that he stayed free of charge at the
COFCO properties. But he said the visits did not affect his
decisions on visas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I ever abuse my position? No,'' he said in a telephone
interview from his parents' home in Las Vegas. ``I'm very emphatic
about that. I'm very clear about that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Parish, who retired from the State Department last year,
expressed regret about his use of the apartments. He acknowledged
that it raised a question of a conflict of interest between his
duties as a government official and his relationship with a
corporate executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear to me now that this is regrettable, that it creates
the appearance of at least a conflict of interest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear what action the State Department might take against
Parish. The department's investigative arm, the Office of the
Inspector General, said he could face criminal prosecution if his
relationship with COFCO involved a quid pro quo. Parish insists
there was none.
</P>
<P>
   Parish's title at the embassy was first secretary and consul. He
said that in his position as chief of the visa section, he was the
``ultimate arbiter'' of applications for visas, which are highly
coveted in China and often difficult to obtain.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Asked if he had known he was violating State Department rules
by staying at the COFCO properties, he said, ``I really can't
recall my state of mind at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Parish said Mann was ``a very warm, gracious, hospitable
person,'' whom he met through business at the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   He said he didn't think Mann had offered him the apartment to
influence his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking looking for anything sinister behind that, and
to this day, I'm convinced, we're friends,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mann is the president of BNU, a Phoenix subsidiary of COFCO.
</P>
<P>
   COFCO is the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import
&AMP; Export Corp. ``Fortune'' magazine last year placed the
corporation, which is directed by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign
Trade, 309th on its list of the world's 500 largest companies. It
ranked ahead of such American giants as Time Warner and Alcoa.
</P>
<P>
   BNU manages the center and Chinese-owned real estate in Phoenix,
Las Vegas and Los Angeles. It also provides auto loans and owns
three shoe factories in China.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwalk property where Parish stayed was the Palm Country
Club, a six-building apartment complex comprising 249 units that
rent for $885 to $1,085 per month. Until last month it was owned by
a partnership consisting of COFCO and the Chinese People's
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   The PLA, which has branched out into a wide range of business
ventures in China and the United States, bought into the property
in 1992 through a U.S. subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokeswoman Maria Rudenski said she could not
comment on Parish's use of the COFCO apartments. She would only
confirm that he was a visa officer at the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Custer, former manager of the Palm Country Club, &UR; said
Parish stayed at the two-bedroom corporate apartment that was
normally reserved for COFCO employees. She estimated that he stayed
there between four and six times.
</P>
<P>
   Custer said she received instructions about Parish's visits from
Mann.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth would call me and let me know that he was coming in
and to be sure that the corporate apartment was available and
cleaned and ready for him,'' Custer said.
</P>
<P>
   Custer said Parish usually stayed at the apartment in the
company of young Chinese women. Parish said the women were
``friends or acquaintances.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He would come and stay two, three, four days at a pop, and we
would have a fruit basket or something delivered there for him,''
Custer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember times when he would be in the corporate suite and
our own employees would have to stay in a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did think it was kind of strange that we would be paying for
a hotel for (COFCO) employees and he'd be staying in a corporate
apartment. That surprised me. So I realized it must have been
something important.''
</P>
<P>
   Custer said Mann ``always wanted to make sure that he was
treated well.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann did not return calls about Parish's stays at the Norwalk
property. But she had earlier acknowledged that Parish had stayed
at another COFCO apartment complex, Gloria Park Villas in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `It's a beautiful place,' and we said, `If you'd like
to stay, you can stay for a night,' '' Mann said. ``He didn't have
to. His parents live in Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann acknowledged that Parish, as head of the visa section at
the embassy, provided assistance to COFCO.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have a problem, we consult him on certain issues: how we
apply,'' she said. ``But we never ask him to issue visas blankly.
We never have to. Why should we?''
</P>
<P>
   Parish attended Arizona State University from 1968 to 1974. He
later earned a degree from Chapman College in Orange, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Mann is a native of China whose given name is Ning Yu. She took
her American name around 1992, when she and her husband, Frederic,
became U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Mann said Parish had visited COFCO's Phoenix offices several
times during his tenure at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted him to visit our company, that's it,'' she
said. ``Like many other people visit our company, he's just one of
those people. We want to promote Phoenix.'' &QL;

DUCKS TURN ON THE POWER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- A power play that Teemu Selanne has described as a
``snowball rolling downhill'' continues to fuel the Ducks' fire.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim had been outscored 106-98 in even-strength situations
(five-on-five abd four-on-four), coming into Sunday's game, but the
Ducks were plus-22 in special teams situations.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks had scored power play goals in 52 of their first 71
games and 33 of their first 37 home games. Anaheim had 75 power
goals. The New York Rangers and Dallas Stars were tied for second
with 66.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks opted to have center Steve Rucchin (groin strain) sit
out one more game in hopes that he'll be ready to play in New
Jersey, where the team starts a five-game road trip on Wednesday.
Anaheim will play those games in just eight days.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks have only three games remaining at the Pond. Anaheim
returns home to play San Jose (April 9), Phoenix (April 11) and St.
Louis (April 14) before completing the regular season with games at
the Kings (April 15) and San Jose (April 17).
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   Fredrik Olausson has missed eight games this season, but the
Anaheim defenseman was still tied for fifth in scoring among
defensemen (49 points) heading into the Calgary game.
</P>
<P>
   The Flames' veteran defenseman, 35-year old Phil Housley was
fourth with 50 points.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Olausson, 32, finished with 42 points for the
Pittsburgh Penguins and Housley had only 31 for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   Fred Brathwaite has become a folk hero of sorts in Calgary this
season. The Flames had gone through five different goalies with
little success before they signed Brathwaite off the Canadian
National team on Jan. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into Sunday's game he was 10-6-7 with a 2.32 goals
against average and an impressive .921 save percentage. Brathwaite
played in 14 consecutive games after being signed and gave Ken
Wregget a chance to get healthy. Wregget has since regained his No.
1 spot, but the Flames would not be in the playoff hunt without
Brathwaite.

BOOK TOUR BRINGING HER ALDED AUTHOR LESLIE MAR MON SILKO TO PHOENIX
AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The rain-washed air of Durango, Colo., was refreshing
for Tucson author Leslie Marmon Silko last week after months of
choking on Arizona dust left by a dry winter.
</P>
<P>
   Silko had driven to Colorado from Flagstaff, Ariz., for a book
signing of her long-awaited novel, ``Gardens in the Dunes.'' Just
days before, she had been at the Northern Arizona Book Festival
alongside famous authors from all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   A full-blown book tour is under way. On April 6, Silko will
appear at Changing Hands Bookstore in Tempe. On April 10, she will
appear at the Arizona Book Festival in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is familiar,'' she said of Durango's St. Lewis College,
where she spoke to an audience that includes many of the young
Native Americans who make up much of the student body. It is her
third visit to the college since she began writing almost 30 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although Silko herself is Native American, reared on the Laguna
Pueblo Reservation in New Mexico, her readers are multicultural and
span a wide age range. Senior citizens, she said, especially enjoy
her ``heartfelt, serious stories.'' They flock to her readings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have inquisitive minds,'' she said. ``They are really
wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   To call Silko simply a Native American writer is to diminish an
author whose style and themes transcend genre fiction. ``Gardens in
the Dunes,'' her third novel, is being compared to Henry James in
its scope, though it does not replicate his ponderous style.
</P>
<P>
   Modern readers will applaud that. Silko's prose is lyrical and
richly detailed. ``Gardens'' is the story of two sisters, their
mother and their Grandma Fleet. It begins at the turn of the
century in the ancestral gardens of their tribe and then travels
from America to Europe _ such a Jamesian locale and time period.
</P>
<P>
   Although Silko's previous novel, 1991's highly praised ``Almanac
of the Dead,'' took a laborious 10 years to write, she spent a
relatively speedy four years writing ``Garden,'' resisting pressure
from her publisher, Simon &AMP; Schuster, to write faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Publishers want a book 18 months after the ink dries on the
contract,'' Silko said by phone from a Durango bed and breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Fans also were eagerly waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by her agent and her editor, Silko managed to hold the
howling wolves at bay long enough to write her novel the way she
wanted, crafting it so meticulously that she was still editing it
in her mind after publication.
</P>
<P>
   She's pleased with the results and with the reviews she has seen
so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different,'' she said. ``I like to do different things.
It goes so many places.''
</P>
<P>
   Silko's grandfather, Grandpa Hank, inspired the novel, she said.
As a boy, Grandpa had attended a White-run Indian school in
Riverside, Calif., which educated many Hopi and Pueblo Indian
children.
</P>
<P>
   Silko began to think about a student mentored by a teacher and
destined for greater things than normally is planned for Native
American children. In ``Gardens in the Dunes,'' such a child is a
girl named Indigo.
</P>
<P>
   Silko's own life and work were shaped by the Laguna Pueblo and a
teacher who sparked her creativity. The nurturing environment in
which she was reared fostered the love of storytelling that would
become her career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surrounded, maybe even in the womb, with a community
that maintains itself and its continuity in the spoken word and a
delight in the narrative,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth grade provided an epiphany.
</P>
<P>
   Silko was transferred from a reservation school to a small,
private Anglo school in Albuquerque. Embarrassed to discover she
was behind the other students in math and science, she withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   But one day her teacher, a war bride from England who might have
empathized with the girl who was feeling like a foreigner, assigned
the class to use their spelling list to write a story.
</P>
<P>
   Silko came alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I escaped the unhappiness of school and being behind,'' she
said. ``That was the big breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   By eighth grade, she was writing poems and stories for Sister
Mary Agnes in a Catholic school where her Native American religion
was tolerated and her writing was encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   She graduated from the University of New Mexico and taught
college English and fiction writing before returning to her
heritage of storytelling. In 1977, after publishing several short
stories and poems, she wrote her first novel, ``Ceremony.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics loved it. But the pigeonholing also had begun. The ``New
York Times''labeled her as the ``most accomplished Indian writer of
her generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Silko is not so much offended by labeling as she is weary of it
_ for herself and other marginalized writers _ gay writers, lesbian
writers, Black writers, women writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here comes the 21st century; maybe we could just talk about
`writers,' '' she said. ``We're such a multicultural society.
People on the street are far away from that (stereotyping).
Marketeers are behind the times.''
</P>
<P>
   She is perhaps ahead of her times and doesn't always like what
she sees. Silko, a human-rights activist in Tucson, said she
believes she is seeing an increase in infringement on civil
liberties by agents involved with the Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, their tactics hit home. Silko and a friend were
pulled over in Tucson by officers who said their car had faulty
headlights. She said that when the officers saw that she was
Indian, several additional units were called, including a canine
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Silko's friend, an Anglo man, was taken away with his car,
leaving Silko alone on a dark Tucson road, she said. She found
assistance at a Circle K.
</P>
<P>
   The officers, Silko said, turned out to be federal Border Patrol
agents who keep an eye on southern Arizona near Mexico. The
incident, she said, is being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Silko, 51, speaks out for all oppressed Americans, not just
Indians. Her heart aches for displaced war veterans who roam the
streets. She fights for the rights of women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   But her greatest enmity is reserved for the folks who patrol the
U.S.-Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the way the powerful and the rich trample the Earth and
all people, women and people of color, . . .'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to know something Gestapo is going on in the
Southwest. The rights of Americans are being eroded.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Allied warplanes braved bad weather Sunday night to
step up attacks on Yugoslav troops while NATO officials repeatedly
accused Serbian forces of large-scale atrocities in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain committed additional aircraft to
the allied force, and NATO's secretary-general, Javier Solana, said
its mission was shifting from neutralizing air defenses to stopping
``the humanitarian catastrophe which is taking place on the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in a brief statement before boarding a
helicopter for Camp David, said he supported the decision to hit a
broader range of targets, including ``forces in the field.'' He
said continuing Serb repression ``underscores the need for NATO to
persevere.'' When a reporter asked if the bombing was accelerating
the atrocities, he replied, ``Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   The shift in targeting, according to Pentagon spokesman Kenneth
Bacon, meant that attacks on military and police targets _ such as
barracks, headquarters and fuel and ammunition depots _ would now
account for more than one-third of all strikes, compared to about
one-fifth in earlier raids. While there may be occasional attacks
on tank columns or artillery, the basic plan is to cut off such
forces from their supply lines and communications, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a fifth straight night of bombing Sunday, NATO mounted
attacks that included cruise missile strikes by B-52 bombers.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the first allied plane loss of the war, an American
F-117 Stealth fighter whose pilot was rescued, Britain announced
that it would add four Harrier fighters to the eight already based
in Italy, and also assigned eight Tornado bombers and a Tristar
air-to-air refuelling tanker to the force. The United States
followed with an announcement that it was adding between six and 12
B-1 bombers and B-52 bombers.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO headquarters in Brussels, British Air Commodore David
Wilby said, ``I'm sure we will get a few more contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   In Yugoslavia itself, state television insisted repeatedly that
the Stealth plane was brought down, and several times aired footage
of the burning wreck. Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
defiantly praised his people and his armed forces for their defense
of Serbia, and staged a celebration in downtown Belgrade _ a rock
concert to show solidarity with the armed forces and to mark the
10th anniversary Sunday of his 1989 move to strip Kosovo of broad
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Air raid sirens wailed several times in Belgrade, and state-run
media gave some details of Saturday night attacks. But no new
casualty figures were announced. Yugoslav state media have
previously spoken of dozens killed in the NATO raids.
</P>
<P>
   On both sides of the Atlantic, officials were being asked what
they would do if air power failed to halt the violence against
Kosovo's Albanians. Clinton administration officials, as well as
those at NATO headquarters, insisted they had no intention of
committing ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Sandy Berger, the president's national security
adviser, was asked on the ABC News program ``This Week'' if he
could ``rule out the use of ground forces in the future?'' He
replied, ``We have no intention of doing that. I don't think it
would be advisable.''
</P>
<P>
   In London, Defense Secretary George Robertson said NATO was
``disrupting the violence.'' He added, ``We have to make sure that
we keep doing it until the genocidal attacking stops.'' But when
asked about sending NATO troops in to stop the atrocities, he said,
``There are absolutely no plans for an opposed entry into Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has agreed to participate with NATO allies in
a Kosovo peacekeeping force should the Belgrade government relent
and join representatives of the Albanian majority in Kosovo in
signing a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Solana, also appearing in the ABC program, said the NATO allies
``are not in a position to deploy troops on the ground prior to a
settlement, to an agreement. This is a position all the countries
maintain until this moment. I don't know how things are going to
evolve, but at this point troops will not be deployed on the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   One strong voice from the Senate disagreed. ``We're in it and we
have to win it,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., appearing on
ABC's ``This Week.'' ``That means we have to exercise every
option.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that ``the American people have to know that these young
men and women that are piloting our airplanes are prepared to go
into harm's way to get the job done. And I would, all of us would,
grieve at the loss of a single American. But when you go into these
things, your primary purpose cannot be the safety of your forces,
it has to be the achievement of your strategic and tactical
goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchinson, R-Texas, appeared on CBS' ``Face the
Nation'' and suggested that ``troops on the ground'' from other
NATO countries might be the right response, because the United
States has taken the leading role in the air campaign. European
politicians express less fear of public reaction to military
casualties than Americans, accepting loss of life as a part of
fighting a war. But even so, they would demand U.S. participation
in any attacking force, as they have for peacekeeping missions in
Bosnia and Macedonia.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And the subject has been discussed, at least gingerly. One of
the ministers in German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's cabinet said
that the chancellor had told him before the air campaign began that
everyone had to be aware that bombing might not stop Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, and that an invasion by NATO troops
might have to be considered.
</P>
<P>
   Another option urged by Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn., and
Mitch McConnell, R-Ken., is for the United States to arm the Kosovo
Liberation Army to fight Milosevic's forces.
</P>
<P>
   Solana said, however, ``I don't think at this point, with a U.N.
resolution preventing the deployment of arms, I don't think it
would be a good idea to help in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the president left for Camp David, he met with national
security advisers. First he saw Berger alone, and then he spent an
hour with Berger, Defense Secretary William Cohen; George Tenet,
director of the CIA; Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff; Secretary of State Madeleine Albright; and Jim
Steinberg, a foreign policy adviser.
</P>
<P>
   They briefed the president on the details of Saturday night's
rescue operation and on the situation in Kosovo, and they reviewed
Sunday night's military plans. An aide said that they did not
discuss the possibility of sending in ground troops, but that the
president was increasingly concerned about the refugees fleeing
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Briefings on Saturday night's attacks were conducted Sunday both
in Brussels and London. In Brussels, Jamie Shea, a NATO spokesman,
said 66 aircraft flew in two waves, attacking 17 major targets.
Both he and Air Commodore Wilby focused their remarks less on
military matters than on what Shea called ``the deteriorating
humanitarian situation in and now around Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was particularly disturbing that hardly any men of
fighting age were among the refugees fleeing into Albania and
Macedonia. Shea asked, ``What has happened to the males between the
ages of 16 to 60?'' Wilby said, ``Villages are being systematically
emptied, looted and permanently destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   In London, Robertson made a similar case, beginning his briefing
by telling reporters: ``I am sorry to have to report that
Yugoslavia's campaign of repression against the Albanian population
is continuing. Seven towns on the Albanian border are reported to
be burning, and on the Macedonian border, as we have all seen on
television, Dakovica is in flames.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands of refugees are streaming across the border from
Kosovo into Albania and there are also reports that civilians may
be used as human shields to protect Milosevic's military machine,''
he said. ``If that is true, this would of course be a war crime in
its own right.''
</P>
<P>
   Vuk Draskovic, the Yugoslav deputy prime minister, denied
accusations that Serbia was committing genocide against ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo or that its security forces were carrying out
systematic ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, absolutely no,'' he said in an interview with CNN. ``We
need Albanians in our state. No one has that genocide strategy.''
He added, ``Albanians are doing that crime against us, I mean
Albanian terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   In his briefing, the British defense secretary also renewed his
warning to Serbian security forces that they were committing war
crimes and that evidence of that was being assembled. He did not
say how.

PEPPER SETS A RECORD AND ENDS HER DROUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By KEN GURNICK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. _ Smashing scoring records for a Ladies
Professional Golf Association major tournament while ending a
two-and-a-half-year victory drought was worth celebrating, Dottie
Pepper figured.
</P>
<P>
   So in she went with her caddie Dan Wilson Sunday, maintaining
the tradition of Nabisco Dinah Shore winners by jumping into the
lake that surrounds the 18th hole at Mission Hills Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper won her second Dinah Shore in historic fashion by a
convincing six strokes over Meg Mallon, shooting a final-day
6-under-par 66 and finishing the four rounds at 19-under 269. That
broke Brandie Burton's record for a major of 18 under par, set at
last year's duMaurier Classic, and it was four strokes better than
Amy Alcott's Dinah Shore record set in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finished second to Amy when she broke the record, I got beat
by eight strokes, and we thought she was so far out of reach,''
said Pepper, who iced the tournament with an eagle from the 16th
fairway. ``It was just one of those weeks. I got a couple of
breaks, but I really played well.''
</P>
<P>
   Although this was not Pepper's first victory at the Dinah Shore,
it was her first celebratory swim. She won in 1992 in a playoff
with Juli Inkster at the waterless 10th hole.
</P>
<P>
   This one was the 15th career victory for Pepper, the 1992 player
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper, 33, last won in September 1996 at the Safeway LPGA
Championship. During a 58-tournament drought since then, she
finished second six times and third four times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the back of your mind when you've played as well as I
have, you start to wonder, what the heck do you have to do to
win?'' Pepper said. ``To come back and win after two and a half
years, and for this to be the place, is pretty darn special.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The $150,000 first-place prize from the $1 million purse
increased her earnings to $288,709, second on this year's money
list behind the three-time winner Karrie Webb, who started the day
tied for 15th and fired a 66 to finish third, 11 strokes back.
</P>
<P>
   Mallon, who tied for second in this tournament in 1996, started
the day down by three strokes, cut it to two with five holes to
play and challenged the tournament record herself before finishing
with a 69, 13 under for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just incredible golf by Dottie,'' Mallon said. ``I
thought I played well this week and I lost by six strokes. On a
major championship course, that's awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   The lead reached five after Pepper birdied the 10th hole, but
Mallon responded with consecutive birdies to delay a rout.
</P>
<P>
   On the 13th hole, Pepper drove behind a tree and bogeyed the
hole, as Mallon closed to within two strokes. A wayward drive by
Pepper on the par-3 14th threatened to turn this into a contest.
But Pepper responded with a 45-foot birdie chip from the fringe and
Mallon missed a 4-foot putt for par, restoring the lead to four
strokes. ``That was the nail in the coffin,'' Mallon said.
</P>
<P>
   Just to be sure, Pepper clinched the victory from the 16th
fairway with a 179-yard eagle 7-iron shot. ``I didn't even think
I'd reach the green,'' she said. ``I just hammered it. The
adrenaline was really flowing.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, the only drama left was how big the final margin
would be and how wet Pepper would get afterward. After a tearful
trophy presentation, she kicked off her shoes and socks, and then
took a running plunge into the water.

DEVILS SETTLE FOR 2-2 TIE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNRISE, Fla. _ The New Jersey Devils were on the verge of
winning two ways Sunday night, widening their Atlantic Division
lead and moving a little closer to history.
</P>
<P>
   Two goals within a 1-minute-30-second span of the second period
put them in great position for victory against Florida, but a late
Panthers goal forced overtime and the Devils had to settle for a
2-2 tie before 18,870 at the National Car Rental Center.
</P>
<P>
   The tie still enabled the visitors to move four points ahead of
Pittsburgh in the Atlantic Division and within three points of
Ottawa, the leader in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   It also extended the Devils' unbeaten streak on the road to six
games (5-0-1). But it left them three victories from tying the
National Hockey League record for most road victories in a season _
27, set by the 1976-77 Montreal Canadiens and equaled by them the
next season _ with five road games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers once were significantly more difficult for the
Devils to handle. Florida won six and tied three of their first 14
games. However, the Devils are unbeaten in the teams' last six
meetings (3-0-3).
</P>
<P>
   Mark Parrish, the Panthers' rookie right wing, scored the
game-tying goal with 2:07 left in regulation. His shot from 30 feet
sailed above goalie Martin Brodeur's glove hand.
</P>
<P>
   It figured that the Devils (39-22-11) would take control of this
game in the second period. That has been their best period this
season and Florida's worst _ by an identical 72-53 goal
differential.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the desperate Panthers _ now five points behind
Boston for an Eastern Conference playoff spot with only 10 games to
play _ scored first, 14:32 into the period.
</P>
<P>
   Center Rob Niedermayer took the puck behind the net, then found
Parrish looming near the crease, and Parrish popped the puck into
the net's left corner. The Devils then scored on two redirected
shots.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first broke a power-play scoring drought. After an 0-for-5
performance in Saturday's game against Chicago, the Devils missed
on their first two power-play attempts Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the needed breakthrough. Brendan Morrison passed from
the corner to right wing Jason Arnott at the left point, and Arnott
promptly sent a laser toward the Panthers' clogged interior
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Center Petr Sykora somehow was there to redirect the puck by
goalie Sean Burke, trying for his 200th National Hockey League
victory.
</P>
<P>
   As the end of the period neared, the Devils got another
fortunate bounce. In almost full stride, right wing Randy McKay
fired from 25 feet. The puck hit off center Sergei Nemchinov's leg
and squibbed between Burke's legs with just 35.2 seconds left on
the clock.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the Devils turned the job over to their defense.
When leading after two periods, the Devils are a gaudy 30-3-4.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Holik, Scott Niedermayer and a newly returned Scott
Stevens kept the heat off Brodeur much of the time.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils came out aggressively, but to no avail. They
fashioned a 17-4 first-period shot advantage, two of those by
Arnott, who came in as the hottest Devil with 11 goals and eight
assists in his last 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers played without wing Pavel Bure (knee). Defenseman
Bill Lindsay missed it with a bruised knee. Over his six-year
career with the Panthers, they are 0-11-2 when he doesn't suit up.
</P>
<P>
   The game was reminiscent of the old, low-scoring Devils. Brodeur
still understands that his defense has given up a little defense to
add more scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still have pressure, but it's not as much as when you know
you have to shut them out _ that if you allow two goals, you're
going to lose the game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From his perspective, his two-goal yield at least netted him a
tie Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   SLAP SHOTS:

DUVAL IS SUPREME, AND HIS DAD'S A WINNER TOO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ On a scale of 1 to 10, David Duval
would rate his weekend a 20.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10 PGA Tour victories that have propelled Duval to the
top of his profession, Sunday's triumph at the Players Championship
was the most demanding, the most impressive, and the most
satisfying. It came against a field that included the world's best
players, on a course that was less forgiving than an IRS agent in a
bad mood.
</P>
<P>
   The victory elevated Duval to No. 1 in the world ranking. He
replaced Tiger Woods, who had held the No. 1 spot for 41 weeks. And
it came on the same day that his father, Bob Duval, won the Senior
Tour Emerald Coast Classic, making the Duvals the first father-son
combination to win PGA Tour events on the same weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Forgive Duval for pinching himself, because Sunday's experience
seemed almost surreal. When he was a teen-ager living in nearby
Jacksonville Beach, he would come to the TPC of Sawgrass every year
to watch players like Seve Ballesteros and Jose Maria Olazabal,
hoping that one day he would walk in their footsteps. Sunday, at
the same course where he once sat in the grandstand, Duval took
center stage and showed his talent. He overcame every challenge,
played his way out of trouble, and fed off the energy of thousands
in the gallery, which urged its hometown hero to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting a 1-over-par 73, to finish 3 under par for the
tournament (285), Duval prevailed by two strokes over Scott Gump
and by three strokes over Nick Price.
</P>
<P>
   The 3 under par was the highest winning score in relation to par
for a Professional Golfers Association Tour event this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Players Championship is often referred to as the fifth
major, and this past weekend's tournament had the feel of a major
event, with players comparing the green speeds to those of the
Masters, and with Duval and Gump the only players to finish under
par.
</P>
<P>
   For Duval, the victory and the No. 1 world ranking reaffirmed
that his game has become the standard by which his peers are
measured. With Sunday's first-place check of $900,000, Duval
surpassed $2 million for the year, and he has won three tour events
this year, while nobody else has won more than one.
</P>
<P>
   His 59 in the final round of the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic in
January tied a PGA record held by two others.
</P>
<P>
   ``He deserves it,'' said Woods, who finished tied for 10th, when
asked about Duval's ranking. ``He has played great golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval's only unfinished business is to win a major, and he will
attempt to do that in a week and a half at the Masters. But for
Sunday, his victory, his father's triumph and the No. 1 ranking
were more than enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been coming to this tournament for years, and to be
honest, I don't know if I thought I was going to win here,'' said
Duval, who lives about eight miles from the practice range at the
TPC of Sawgrass. ``Some of the noise today was deafening,
especially on No. 9 after I holed out of the bunker. The people
were just going nuts, and they helped carry me today. It was
something I fed off of.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was an edge that Duval welcomed, because the course simply
offered no letup. Duval started the day with a one-stroke lead over
Skip Kendall, who tied for 10th place after Sunday's 78, and Phil
Mickelson, who tumbled to an 82 Sunday and finished tied for 32d.
</P>
<P>
   Duval faced immediate trouble himself, making a bogey on the
first hole, and after Kendall birdied No. 2 and No. 3, Duval
trailed Kendall by two strokes. But after Kendall bogeyed Nos. 5, 6
and 8, and Duval bogeyed No. 8, Duval and Kendall reached the ninth
green tied for the lead at 3 under par.
</P>
<P>
   And it was at No. 9 that Duval hit two of his finest shots. The
first one was an approach shot from a fairway bunker behind a tree
that sailed between an opening in the branches into a greenside
bunker. Had Duval hit the tree, he would probably have been looking
at a bogey or worse. ``I just said, `It's time to play golf,'''
Duval said. ``If I don't pull it off, I'm going to make a pretty
high score.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Duval followed that daring shot with a great one, a 20-foot
bunker shot that rolled into the cup for a birdie. ``As a lot of
players and some of my friends will attest, I spend a lot time
working in the bunkers,'' Duval said. ``I hit a great little shot.
That kind of settled me down, made me feel good about the decision
I made on the shot before.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he reached No. 17, the famous par-3 island-green
hole that has been the site of many wrecked dreams, Duval had a
one-stroke lead over Gump, who was in the clubhouse at one under
par. Gump made a costly mistake at No. 17, hitting an 8-iron into
the water, leading to a double-bogey. But Gump, showed his courage
by rebounding to make an 18-foot birdie putt at No. 18, a putt that
secured second place ($540,000).
</P>
<P>
   But Duval had come too far to let this slip away. Ignoring the
water and the pressure, Duval hit a great tee shot at No. 17, a
wedge shot that stopped 6 feet short of the cup. Then Duval made
the birdie putt, giving him a crucial two-shot cushion as he
reached the difficult par 4 No. 18. Then Duval sealed his victory
with a solid par, chipping his third shot from behind the green to
within 2 feet of the cup, then tapping in for victory.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, Duval was sitting on top of the golf world. And
when asked if Sunday was the best day of his life, Duval had an
answer. ``It will never stray out of the top two or three,'' he
said. ``I was probably more nervous today than I was at Augusta
last year. I'm going over to a friend's house who invited us to
dinner, and I was hoping it would be a celebration. And it is.''
</P>
<P>
   CHIP SHOTS:
</P>
<P>
   Nick Faldo was disqualified for failing to identify his ball
after he hit his second shot at No. 6 into a palm tree.

EDITORIAL: A NEW BROOM FOR BOXING 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION NOTICE: Also filed in category ``k'') 
(lh) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, March 29:
</P>
<P>
   The people who organized the farcical heavyweight title bout
between Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis are busily arranging a
rematch, perhaps hoping _ in the words of the promoter Don King _
that the prospect of another fight will act as a ``curative,''
erasing the memories of one of the worst decisions in the history
of an already-tarnished sport. King and his confederates may also
be banking on the boxing public's notorious cynicism and the fact
that boxing's historical landscape is littered with
well-intentioned investigations that have gone nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   But the press and the politicians cannot let slip what could be
a watershed moment in a sport that has been in need of reform for
decades. In plain view of 21,000 people in New York City's Madison
Square Garden and a million more who paid $50 to watch on
television, the judges awarded a draw in a fight that clearly
belonged to Lewis. Their verdict embarrassed Gov. George Pataki and
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who had hoped for a rebirth of big-time
boxing in New York, and provoked investigations by Manhattan's
district attorney, Robert Morgenthau, the state Athletic Commission
and a commission headed by state Sen. Roy Goodman. A resolute
investigation could create the momentum necessary to toughen New
York state's boxing laws and, on a national level, greatly improve
the chances of an important bill sponsored by Sen. John McCain to
undermine the monopolistic powers of the promoters and the ratings
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   There are two main issues _ the verdict itself and the
underlying power of the predators who run boxing. The initial
attention has focused on Eugenia Williams, a veteran judge who gave
the fight to Holyfield. Ms. Williams, who works as an accountant in
Atlantic City, N.J., filed for personal bankruptcy six weeks before
the fight. She has denied that she was offered financial help to
influence the verdict in Holyfield's favor. Her explanation was
that she had bad sightlines and could not see the Lewis punches
that impressed the global television audience.
</P>
<P>
   Given the importance of the fight, her excuse was mind-boggling.
Whether she was tampered with or was merely inept is clearly a
central question facing Morgenthau. But even if he finds no
personal wrongdoing, he can at least expose the seamy conflicts of
interest that have done so much to disfigure the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Judges, to name one such conflict, are chosen by the three
ratings organizations. The International Boxing Federation chose
Ms. Williams. Holyfield is the IBF's champion, and it reaps
lucrative sanctioning fees when he fights. Ms. Williams' decision
allowed the IBF to keep Holyfield as its champion, and the fees
that go with him. King paid the judges their fees and expenses. He
also controls Holyfield, and the judge's illogical scoring means he
can draw from the Holyfield well once again.
</P>
<P>
   One answer is to put the selection and payment of judges in the
hands of the state Athletic Commission. McCain's bill would go
further, attacking the corruptive alliance between promoters who
force marquee fighters to sign multi-year contracts and the
organizations that manipulate the rankings to guarantee lucrative
bouts for favored promoters. McCain's bill would throw a lot of
sand in this self-perpetuating machine.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed the Senate unanimously last October but needs
help in the House. Nothing would boost it more than a thorough
investigation of the Holyfield-Lewis fight, not just because this
decisions reeks, but because the fight game has been cheating

EDITORIAL: A NEW BROOM FOR BOXING

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, March 29:
</P>
<P>
   The people who organized the farcical heavyweight title bout
between Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis are busily arranging a
rematch, perhaps hoping _ in the words of the promoter Don King _
that the prospect of another fight will act as a ``curative,''
erasing the memories of one of the worst decisions in the history
of an already-tarnished sport. King and his confederates may also
be banking on the boxing public's notorious cynicism and the fact
that boxing's historical landscape is littered with
well-intentioned investigations that have gone nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   But the press and the politicians cannot let slip what could be
a watershed moment in a sport that has been in need of reform for
decades. In plain view of 21,000 people in New York City's Madison
Square Garden and a million more who paid $50 to watch on
television, the judges awarded a draw in a fight that clearly
belonged to Lewis. Their verdict embarrassed Gov. George Pataki and
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who had hoped for a rebirth of big-time
boxing in New York, and provoked investigations by Manhattan's
district attorney, Robert Morgenthau, the state Athletic Commission
and a commission headed by state Sen. Roy Goodman. A resolute
investigation could create the momentum necessary to toughen New
York state's boxing laws and, on a national level, greatly improve
the chances of an important bill sponsored by Sen. John McCain to
undermine the monopolistic powers of the promoters and the ratings
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   There are two main issues _ the verdict itself and the
underlying power of the predators who run boxing. The initial
attention has focused on Eugenia Williams, a veteran judge who gave
the fight to Holyfield. Ms. Williams, who works as an accountant in
Atlantic City, N.J., filed for personal bankruptcy six weeks before
the fight. She has denied that she was offered financial help to
influence the verdict in Holyfield's favor. Her explanation was
that she had bad sightlines and could not see the Lewis punches
that impressed the global television audience.
</P>
<P>
   Given the importance of the fight, her excuse was mind-boggling.
Whether she was tampered with or was merely inept is clearly a
central question facing Morgenthau. But even if he finds no
personal wrongdoing, he can at least expose the seamy conflicts of
interest that have done so much to disfigure the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Judges, to name one such conflict, are chosen by the three
ratings organizations. The International Boxing Federation chose
Ms. Williams. Holyfield is the IBF's champion, and it reaps
lucrative sanctioning fees when he fights. Ms. Williams' decision
allowed the IBF to keep Holyfield as its champion, and the fees
that go with him. King paid the judges their fees and expenses. He
also controls Holyfield, and the judge's illogical scoring means he
can draw from the Holyfield well once again.
</P>
<P>
   One answer is to put the selection and payment of judges in the
hands of the state Athletic Commission. McCain's bill would go
further, attacking the corruptive alliance between promoters who
force marquee fighters to sign multi-year contracts and the
organizations that manipulate the rankings to guarantee lucrative
bouts for favored promoters. McCain's bill would throw a lot of
sand in this self-perpetuating machine.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed the Senate unanimously last October but needs
help in the House. Nothing would boost it more than a thorough
investigation of the Holyfield-Lewis fight, not just because this
decisions reeks, but because the fight game has been cheating
honest fans for generations.

SMALL VICTORY FOR RANGERS: LINDROS SUSPENDED FOR 2 GAMES 
</HEADLINE>

 By JOE LAPOINTE

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Rangers are without many victories lately, but
they won one small battle off the ice Sunday when the National
Hockey League suspended Eric Lindros for two games for cutting Petr
Nedved with a high stick on Saturday. Nedved bled from three places
around his right eye when Lindros injured him late in the Flyers'
3-1 victory in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The loss left the Rangers with a 1-3-2 record in their last six
games, and it left them seven points behind eighth-place Boston in
the race for the eighth and final playoff berth in the Eastern
Conference. The Rangers have nine games remaining, one fewer than
the Bruins. The Rangers play host to the Islanders tonight at
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's game, Neil Smith, the Rangers' general manager,
said he called Colin Campbell, the senior vice president of the
NHL, to demand a review of the Lindros-Nedved incident.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released through the NHL office Sunday, Campbell
said, ``Mr. Lindros used his stick in a careless manner and an
injury to Mr. Nedved resulted.'' The league said Lindros would be
fined $86,458 based on the average annual value of his contract,
which is $8.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros, the Flyers' captain, seemed more apologetic about being
penalized _ Referee Kerry Fraser called a double minor _ than he
did about Nedved's injury. ``I got my penalty for four minutes,''
Lindros said on Saturday. ``It was an unfortunate time to take it,
but it happens in games sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindros said he reacted when he felt Nedved's stick hooking him.
However, Fraser did not penalize Nedved, whose cuts needed
stitches.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros was not in uniform Sunday when the Flyers' three-game
winning streak was ended at Detroit, 3-2, in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty on Lindros gave the Rangers a manpower advantage for
the final 3 minutes 30 seconds, but they could not score.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of reasons for the Rangers' lack of success.
Brian Leetch, the attacking defenseman, has not scored in 21
consecutive games and has only three goals in the last 47 and only
nine this season. At the point on the power play, Leetch is passing
instead of shooting, perhaps because he is covered tightly. His
shots seem to lack speed and force, perhaps because he is fatigued
from playing about 30 minutes each game.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gretzky, back for three games after missing 12 with a neck
injury, has no goal or assist since his return. His minus-1 in the
plus/minus ratio Saturday left him at minus-23 for the season,
worst on the team.
