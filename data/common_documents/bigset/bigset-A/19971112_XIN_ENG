<HEADLINE> Red Cross Seeks Financial Aid for Chernobyl Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Geneva-based International
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies launched here
today an appeal seeking 1.3 million Swiss francs (about 0.92
million US dollars) for its humanitarian assistance to Chernobyl
victims.
</P>
<P>
More than 11 years after the world's worst technological
accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the former Soviet
Union, hundreds of thousands of people in Belarus, Ukraine and
Russia are still suffering from the consequences of Chernobyl, the
federation said in its press release.
</P>
<P>
"The incidence of thyroid gland cancer is rising, in particular
among children," the federation said. "A further rise is
expected."
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, around 1,000 children in the three countries have
been confirmed to have thyroid gland cancer, a spokesman for the
federation said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, the Red Cross has run six mobile diagnostic
laboratories to measure radioactivity in the environment and to
examine people's general health, which includes scanning for
thyroid irregularities.
</P>
<P>
The appeal today is looking for funds to help 200,000 people
for another year. "We need to find long-term solutions for
long-term problems," said Dr Jean-Pierre Revel of the federation's
relief health department. It is seeking funds for the new few
years before handing the program over to the Red Cross societies
in the three countries.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Parliament to Pass New Oil Deregulation Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Congress will
speed up the passage of a new oil deregulation law to save the
country's liberalized oil industry, which will have to be
regulated again under an earlier ruling from the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader Francisco Tatad said today that the
Senate leadership has promised to President Fidel Ramos to step up
the drafting of a new oil deregulation bill.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last week, the Supreme Court overwhelmingly ruled to
nullify the country's nine-month-old oil deregulation law on the
ground that it was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
The court said the law violates the constitution by allowing
the country's three dominant oil companies to gain monopoly of the
industry.
</P>
<P>
Tatad said the Senate Committee on Energy is expected to start
this week its hearing on a new deregulation bill he filed, along
with those filed by other senators.
</P>
<P>
With the Senate's commitment, Tatad said, the committee shall
speed up the study on the proposed new oil deregulation measure
and come up with a consolidated version of the bill in several
days.
</P>
<P>
"We expect to have a new oil deregulation law in place as soon
as the Supreme Court ruling becomes final and executory," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the House of Representatives also promised to push for
the quick passage of a new oil deregulation law of its own
version.
</P>
<P>
The high tribunal has given the government 15 days to file a
motion for reconsideration on its ruling on the oil deregulation
law.
</P>
<P>
The oil deregulation law is vital for the Philippines to be
free from the supervision of its economy by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF). A return to oil regulation will likely delay
the country's exit from the IMF control.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Warns of Rising Fraud in Gold Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Ghana government,
concerned with rising fraud in the buying and selling of gold,
today warned through its high commission in Harare that foreign
dealers engaged in such practices risk being cheated.
</P>
<P>
Head of the high commission in Zimbabwe Awinador-Kanyirige
said in a statement that there was a misconception among
foreigners that gold could be bought at a significant discount in
the west African nation.
</P>
<P>
''It has come to the attention of the Ghana government that,
as a result of Ghana's favorable business climate and
international reputation as a major gold exporter, numerous
foreign companies and individuals have sought to get rich quick
through gold transactions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the price of gold in Ghana is comparable to world
prices, and advised that all small-holder purchases should be
conducted through the precious minerals marketing corporation.
</P>
<P>
Prospective buyers who conducted business outside the official
channels did so at their own risk, he said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Promote Economic Ties with Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian prime
minister's economic advisor Tim Daim Zainuddin said today his
country is keen to promote business and investment relations with
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Lahore,
Zainuddin said Malaysia had introduced an interest-free economy in
order to establish the Islamic Monitory System.
</P>
<P>
The interest-free economy generates more profits and savings in
business activities, said Zainuddin, who is visiting Pakistan as
the head of an 11-member Malaysian trade delegation.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the Pakistani-Malaysian business relations,
Zaiuddin said the incentives and facilities offered by the
Pakistani government had attracted Malaysian entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that a number of joint ventures in various industrial
and commercial sectors will be materialized in the due course.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan imported goods worth 14.26 billion rupees (about 325
million U.S. dollars) from Malaysia in 1996-97, while its exports
to Malaysia in the same period were worth only 840 million rupees
(19 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> FM: Canada Supports UN Actions Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Canada today expressed its
support for the United Nations to take firm actions against Iraq
over the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
Iraq should honor its obligations and respect to the U.N.
Security Council resolutions, Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd
Axworthy said at a joint press conference here with Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy after their talks.
</P>
<P>
"We're steadfast in our support for the U.N. position.... We
want to see the U.N. take firm actions to ensure that the Iraqis
live up to their obligations and the resolutions," Axworthy said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's decision on October 29 to expel American inspectors on
the U.N. weapons inspection teams overseeing the disarmament of
Iraq has incurred a crisis between Iraq and the U.N. as well as
the United States.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Axworthy and Levy discussed wide range of
issues concerning bilateral ties, Israel's participation in the
upcoming anti-mine conference in Canadian capital Ottawa and the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Canadian relations were soured in late September
when two Israeli agents using forged Canadian passports carried
out a failed assassination attempt against Hamas political leader
Khaled Mashaal in Amman.
</P>
<P>
Canada lodged a protest by recalling its ambassador to Israel,
which took quick actions to remedy the ties. Levy sent a formal
apology to Axworthy in early October for the affair.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy said that he got clear assurance from Levy today to
prevent such incident from happening again.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy praised Israel's decision to attend the Ottawa
anti-mine conference next month as a serious effort to eliminate
mines.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian minister arrived here today for a one-day visit.
He will later travel to Turkey, and then Qatar to attend the
Middle East and North Africa economic conference on November
16-18.

<HEADLINE> China Anticipates Closer Worldwide Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li
Lanqing said here today that China plans to establish closer
economic ties worldwide in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Li, who also serves as a member of the Standing Committee of
the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese
Communist Party, made the
remarks during an international symposium on investment
policy and investment risk insurance.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier noted that China is a driving force in
worldwide trade and economic development. He noted that China's
import and export volume hit 289 billion US dollars in 1996, and
ranked 11th amongst the world's major trading nations.
</P>
<P>
China's vast potential market, one of the most attractive
in the world, has attracted foreign funds of over 320
billion US dollars, including some 200 billion US dollars
in foreign direct investment.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government had approved the establishment of some
300,000 foreign-funded enterprises by the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Li projected that the country's total import and export volume
will hit 310 billion US dollars by the end of this year, with
foreign direct investments expected to surpass 43 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that China's import and export volume will top 400
billion US dollars by the year 2000, a fact which will vigorously
promote world trade and economic development, and will at the same
time create wide-ranging opportunities for cooperation between
China and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Today's symposium, sponsored by the State Planning
Commission, attracted representatives from 20 countries and
regions, including the United States, France, Germany and Japan.

<HEADLINE> New HIV Genotype Found in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- A new genotype of the human
deficiency virus (HIV), which cause the dreaded acquired immuned
deficiency symdrone (AIDS), has been found in Nigeria, the
Guardian reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted chief epidemiologist Abdulsalam Nasidi as
saying that the government is trying to identify the new genotype
which was previously unknown with the assistance of some foreign
scientists.
</P>
<P>
The strange genotype was found in Lagos, the largest city of
the country in the southwest, and Maiduguri, capital of Borno
state in the northeast.
</P>
<P>
Nasidi's disclosure at a national symposium on HIV and AIDS on
Monday came amid worries expressed by medical scientists about
rising AIDS pandemic in Nigeria in face of government's weak
control program.
</P>
<P>
He said Nigeria had the opportunity to devise formidable plan
of action between 1986 nd 1990 when the disease was still at its
formative stage but it failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of AIDS had increased by 500 fold in the country
between 1986 and last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
He did not disclose the figure of AIDS cases across the
country.
</P>
<P>
However, Kenneth Oforu-Barko, representative of a joint United
Nations program on HIV/AIDS in Nigeria, said acumulative 10,803
AIDS cases had been reported in the country to the national
AIDS/STD control program.
</P>
<P>
Barko predicted that there should be less than 364,286
cumulative cases of AIDS in the country by the year 2000 and that
the cumulative deaths from AIDS could be 304,285.
</P>
<P>
According to him, there are an estimated 2.2 million of the
100 million Nigerians living with HIV, while 103,580 deaths will
occur from AIDS this year alone, which could be translated to 284
per day.
</P>
<P>
He called for research in molecular epidemiology of HIV, and
vaccines as well as social, operation and evaluative research as
a means of combating the pandemic.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe and Israel are likely
to enter into joint development of solar and renewable energy, an
Israeli official said today.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Israeli Director of Energy Resources Management
Department in the Ministry of National Infrastructure Joseph
Nowarski said solar and renewable energy offers great potential
for economic cooperation between Israel and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe's solar energy development infrastructure is
at an advanced stage.
</P>
<P>
"I am on a two-day visit at the invitation of the Zimbabwean
government which, after hosting the solar summit last year, feels
responsible for continuing efforts to make solar energy more
popular worldwide," he said.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Nowarski is scheduled to meet officials from
the Zimbabwean Ministry of Transport and Energy Wednesday to
discuss possible areas of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Israel, whose territory is 60 percent desert, is one of the
leading world users of solar energy.
</P>
<P>
It carries out extensive solar research and development at a
number of universities and institutions at desert to provide
substantial amounts of solar-derived power.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, with prolonged periods of sunshine throughout any
given year, plans to maximize the use of solar energy in rural
areas where 80 percent of the 12.4 million people live.

<HEADLINE> Canada Likely to Reap Budget Surplus This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Canada's federal government is
on track this year to post its first annual budget surplus in
nearly three decades, said reports today.
</P>
<P>
Finance Department figures showed that Ottawa racked up a 2
billion dollar (1.4 billion US dollar) surplus in September,
leaving it 1.7 billion dollars in the black for the first half of
the 1997-98 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
That represented Canada's first six-month budgetary surplus in
at least 25 years, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
For the same period last year, Ottawa got a deficit of 7
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Paul Martin said last month that the
government would balance its budget no later than next year.
</P>
<P>
But Prime Minister Jean Chretien has since said that his
government could eliminate the deficit as early as this year.
</P>
<P>
Ottawa posted an 8.9 billion dollar deficit last year.
</P>
<P>
The department cautioned against using the results of the first
six months to forecast a surplus for the whole fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
There have been some extra revenue gains in the first half of
the year that won't be available in the second half, such as
additional employment-insurance premiums, the department noted.

OTTAWA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Compaq Canada Inc. widened its
lead over IBM Canada Ltd. in the third quarter, getting almost
one-fifth of the country's personal computer market.
</P>
<P>
Compaq grabbed 18.9 percent of the consumer and corporate
market for PCs, up from 14.7 percent in the second quarter, said a
report today.
</P>
<P>
Second to Compaq was IBM, which had a 16.3 percent share of the
market. It was followed by Dell Canada, which had 6.9 percent of
the market, according to the Financial Post newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Much of Compaq's lead comes from spectacular growth in sales of
consumer products, especially its Presario line of PCs, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
Ralph Hyatt, manager of product marketing at Compaq Canada,
said he expects the PC market to grow by up to 15 percent in the
country this year, with Compaq's share growing by four or five
times that rate.
</P>
<P>
He expects the smallest players in the PC industry will
continue to be squeezed out by competition on price.
</P>
<P>
The price cuts will continue, with reductions up to 10 percent
in 1998, he predicted.

<HEADLINE> German Tax Gap to Be 17.3 Billion Marks in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Germany would face a huge
shortfall of 17.3 billion marks (10 billion U.S. dollars) in tax
revenues in 1997, the German Finance Ministry confirmed today.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest projections by a government-appointed
tax estimate group, the gap in government tax revenues would widen
further to 22.4 billion marks (13 billion dollars) in 1998, the
ministry added.
</P>
<P>
However, officials of the ministry were also quoted by the
German media as saying that despite the declining tax revenues,
the country's total budget deficit this year would be about 72
billion marks ((42 billion dollars), only slightly above the
planned level of 71.2 billion marks.
</P>
<P>
German Finance Minister Theo Waigel today also said in Bonn
that Germany would still be able to meet the budget target of the
single European currency, which requires a European Union country
to bring its budget deficit to less than 3 percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP) in order to qualify for its membership.
</P>
<P>
Waigel was scheduled to make a statement later today to say
what the government will undertake to try to close the financial

MOGADISHU, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The central town of
Beledweyne has been plagued by floods from the Shabelle River
that burst its banks and poured into town yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The inhabitants of Beledweyne Town, 300 km north of the
capital, have moved their children and precious pieces of
property to the nearby mountains that surround the town.
</P>
<P>
According to regional governor of Hiran, Hassan Abdulle Qalad,

into the area.
</P>
<P>
Qalad added that the floods have also severely affected 35
villages that surround Beledweyne.
</P>
<P>
Beledweyne, the largest flood-affected town of the country so
far has now been out of reach since all the bridges that linked
the town, collapsed.
</P>
<P>
River Shabelle passes through the town twice in the shape of
"S", and it has first burst its bank in the Irid Amin area, north
of Beledweyne.
</P>
<P>
Qalad disclosed that 15 families are so far known to have
drowned in the waters, adding the people of the town are now
running short of food and have no shelter at all on the hilly

<HEADLINE> Britain Sets Out 3 Pillars for Competitiveness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Strong markets, modern
companies and looking to the future are the three pillars of
Britain's new approach to competitive success, Margaret Beckett,
president of the Board of Trade, said today.
</P>
<P>
Beckett told the Confederation of British Industry's (CBI)
Annual Conference, "We must tread a fresh path -- neither too much
interference nor the neglect of sheer indifference -- but a new
third way."
</P>
<P>
The three pillars are the themes which bind all of the
activities of the Department of Trade and Industry to the pursuit
of competitiveness and against which the department will measure
the worth and relevance of those activities, Beckett added.
</P>
<P>
On strong markets, she said that a strong competition policy is
fundamental to competitiveness. That's why one of the government's
earliest actions was to find for a Competition Bill and search for
greater transparency, predictability and consistency in
regulation.
</P>
<P>
Referring to modern companies, Beckett said that only modern
companies can address modern challenges. Modern companies
succeeding in new markets with new products -- companies that are
competing on strengths in design, in science, in ideas -- not on
cheap labor.
</P>
<P>
Beckett also set out her views on corporate governance: "We
want forms of governance and company law that encourage companies
to invest and grow to take the long term strategic view and a
broad view of their obligations."
</P>
<P>
She said that they should also guarantee openness, transparency
and accountability, not least in the relationship between
shareholders and management.
</P>
<P>
On looking to the future, she said that the Labor government
can help or hinder the development of new firms, new ideas -- keep
them here or let them drift abroad.
</P>
<P>
Beckett suggested that the government must embrace the
industries of the future and in particular it must address the
specific needs of smaller firms.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Islamic Party to Defend against Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Necmettin Erbakan, chairman of
Turkey's pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP), will deliver a verbal
statement to the Constitutional Court next week to defend agaisnt
a closure case concerning his party.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan came to the court earlier today but failed to make the
statement as planned. The reason remained unknown.
</P>
<P>
RP Deputy Chairman Sevket Kazan announced to the press in the
court that Erbakan would defend for his party on November 18, the
Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Chief Prosecutor Vural Savas filed a case with the
Constitutional Court in May demanding the Islamist party be shut
down on the grounds of its support for fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan resigned as prime minister in June under pressure from
the pro-secular military which criticized him for his reluctance
to take tough measures against fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
The legal procedures of the closure case will be completed and
the court will render its ruling after Erbakan delivers his verbal
statement.
</P>
<P>
According to Turkey' Party Law, Erbakan and some senior RP
officials will be banned from engaging in politics for at least
five years if the party is outlawed.

<HEADLINE> Mercedes Suspends Delivery on New A-Class Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The German carmaker Mercedes-Benz
is halting the delivery on its controversial new A-class compact
for 12 weeks for modification of the car's suspension regulation
system, its parent company Daimler-Benz announced today.
</P>
<P>
The Stuttgart-based firm assured that the modifications would
cure the problem causing the newly-introduced car to roll over
when radically swerving to avoid road obstacles during a test in
Sweden last month.
</P>
<P>
Daimler said the modifications would include news stabilizers
and a retuning of the springs and shock absorbers with the axles.
Also, a different tire would be adopted and the car body work
would be lowered.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago the company said that all the sold 3,000 A-class
models would also be modified, but did not specify its plan to
recall them.
</P>
<P>
Daily output of the A-class model stands currently at 200
units, and will be raised to 800 in February, according to
Daimler.
</P>
<P>
The five-door A-class model represents Mercedes' first entry
into compact-category and is designed to compete with the
bestselling Volkswagen's Golf.

<HEADLINE> Tough Decisions on Spending, Borrowing: CBI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The government should set a
firm ceiling of 40 percent GDP on the amount of public spending
paid for by taxes and government borrowing, according to a
Confederation of British Industry (CBI) paper out today.
</P>
<P>
In a discussion document on government expenditure and
borrowing, the CBI set out some options for the tough decisions
that the government needs to make.
</P>
<P>
There is a sound economic case for limiting the percentage of
public spending raised through taxes, and also for keeping public
borrowing within limits, the document added.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Buxton, chairman of the CBI's Economic Affairs
Committee, said at the closing session of the CBI conference, "The
government faces difficult choices as it seeks to balance the
growing demand for public services with the need to keep down
public borrowing and tax rises."
</P>
<P>
"The government should consider extending new ways of paying
for services to allow funding for education and transport to rise
in real terms," he added.
</P>
<P>
The CBI accepted that it has not been easy to keep down public
spending, but Britain has done well compared with the rest of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
It recommended that the government's current plans to contain
public spending should be sufficiently tight but meeting these
plans is likely to prove a demanding task.

<HEADLINE> Canada on Verge of Postal Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Canada is on the verge of its
first postal strike in six years as Canada Post and postal workers
count down to the deadline of midnight Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Talks broke off on the weekend, but both parties hope to resume
discussions before time runs out.
</P>
<P>
"As it stands now, we are on 24-hour standby, ready and willing
to negotiate," said Darrell Tingley, head of the Canadian Union of
Postal Workers.
</P>
<P>
"We can't continue to talk to ourselves," said a spokesman of
the corporation.
</P>
<P>
Talks stalled as the two sides could not reach agreement on the
proposed 200 million dollar (140 million US dollar) reduction in
labor costs and wage increases.
</P>
<P>
The union said the reduction will mean 4,000 jobs lost, while
the corporation insisted no one will lose their job because work
rules can be adjusted to save money.
</P>
<P>
The union is asking for wage increases of more than 8 percent
over 18 months, while Canada Post is offering increases of 3
percent over two years.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are so far apart they need the threat of a strike
or lockout to reach an agreement, said the conciliator appointed
to help settle the labor dispute.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Ruling Party Calls for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Angolan People's
Liberation Movement (MPLA) today urged the government and
especially the former rebel UNITA movement to make greater effort
for the final peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
Marking the 22nd anniversary of the independence of Angola,
the ruling party said in a communique that the government and the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
should join hands to remove any obstacles to Angola's final
peace.
</P>
<P>
The party said it regretted that the threat of war is still
hanging over the country three years after the Lusaka Peace
Protocol was signed, saying that this situation bars the nation
and its citizens from devoting their energy fully to building the
country.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that to reach the goal mapped out by the
Lusaka accord, UNITA should carry out all the obligations as
outlined by the pact.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka Peace Protocol stipulated that UNITA should disarm
its army entirely and hand over all its weapons to the U.N.
monitoring team, turn its radio station into a non-party
commercial one, and re-establish government institutions in areas
under its control and create conditions for free movement of
people in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The statement also urged that UNITA move its headquarters to
Luanda as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The communique, issued by the political bureau of the ruling
party, called on all Angolans to unite for the realization of
final peace in the country in a spirit of tolerance and mutual
support, so as to rid the country of its serious social and
economic crisis.

AMMAN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- All the medical tests that

</P>
<P>
The king underwent a minor surgery to remove part of his
swollen prostate gland in the U.S. in April. In August
1992, Hussein also underwent a successful cancer surgery in the
United States.

<HEADLINE> Britons Turn to More Health-Conscious Diets: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- British people have turned to
more health-conscious diets by eating more fruit and vegetables,
but less fat, according to the National Food Survey 1996.
</P>
<P>
The survey, published annually by the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, showed that average consumption of fresh fruit
per head rose just under 3 percent in 1996 and was 17 percent
higher than 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The average consumption of vegetable per head was also up, by 4
percent excluding potatoes. However, it was still 9 percent lower
than in 1986 and people are eating less greens.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that the percentage of food energy provided by
fat was down a tenth of a percentage point, continuing its
long-term decline in the British diet.
</P>
<P>
The biggest decline in consumption last year was in beef and
veal, which was down 17 percent following the mad cow disease
scare. There was also an 8 percent fall in consumption of meat and
meat products eaten out.
</P>
<P>
However, fish consumption reached its highest level for more
than 20 years and there were also marked increases in consumption
of mutton, lamb and poultry.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Immunization Drive Targets at 8.6m </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November (Xinhua) -- The Nation-Wide Immunization
Days (NID) which will be launched in Ethiopia this week will
target 8.6 million children under the age of five, a senior
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Adem Ibrahim, Ethiopian Minister of Health announced this at
a press conference on the NID here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Adem said this year's NID are conducted in the whole country
during November 13-16 with polio vaccine and on December 12-14
with polio vaccine and vitamin supplements.
</P>
<P>
A total of 25,487 posts will be prepared for this year's NID,
with 28,058 health staff and 51,681 volunteers involved, he said,
adding that each immunization post will be staffed with a minimum
of one health staff plus two volunteers.
</P>
<P>
Adem further said that the disease has now disappeared in 120
countries. However, it continues to affect and kill in some of
the poorest and more densely populated countries, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the situation in Ethiopia, Adem said, "it is
estimated (there are) 2,000 cases per year. Currently, there are
about 60,000 cases every year globally, and 12,000 in the African
continent."
</P>
<P>
This means that Ethiopia is contributing three percent and 17
percent of cases to the world and Africa respectively, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has planned to eradicate polio by the year 2000. This
is the first nation-wide immunization campaign to be launched in
the country and the campaign will be conducted in all states,
regions and districts of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the immunization days were launched in nine
selected urban areas with about 300,000 children under the age of
five years immunized against poliomyelitis.
</P>
<P>
Polio is an infectious disease caused by a virus doing harm to
the nervous system, affects mostly children, usually before 5
years of age.
</P>
<P>
The disease causes paralysis, usually of the legs, and
sometimes death. Paralysis begins rapidly in one or two days and
is permanent. There is no treatment, but it can be prevented
through immunization with oral polio vaccine.

<HEADLINE> No Results Expected From Discussions in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special envoy for Cyprus
Richard Holbrooke said here today that he did not expect any
results from his discussions with the two leaders of the two
communities in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement following a four-hour meeting with
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash, held at the Ledra Palace Hotel in the U.N.-controlled
buffer zone in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
However, Holbrooke said he would leave the island "with a very
much improved understanding of the views of the two leaders."
</P>
<P>
He refrained from revealing what was discussed, saying that
"these were informal talks, we did not expect any results today
that would be substantive."
</P>
<P>
In response to local criticism that he is here to back
Clerides' candidacy in next February's presidential elections,
Holbrooke said "we are not here to involve ourselves in a domestic
political election in the Republic of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
He said he discussed with the leaders of the two communities
the issues that have long divided this trouble island.
</P>
<P>
Replying to questions at a press conference, Holbrooke
described the discussions as "candid and confidential" and were
conducted in a very positive atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Today's discussions, he added, showed a "willingness to try
to address the problems of the future."
</P>
<P>
He said he did not ask the two leaders for a commitment to
continue some kind of dialogue until March next year.
</P>
<P>
The differences between the two leaders in the island are very
profound and they range from very small details like the content
of documents to very basic issues like how to deal with the right
of refugees to return, Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
Defining his task in the peace effort, Holbrooke said the
U.S. believes this region is critical to stability for the
U.S. national security and the Europe.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that stability is an essential goal in the post
cold war period and in my view the other issues between Greece
and Turkey cannot be dealt with unless Cyprus is dealt with
centrally, it is the core issue," the U.S. envoy stressed.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke noted that he would consult with U.S. ambassadors
in Nicosia, Ankara and Athens as well as U.S. President Bill
Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright before deciding
on his next steps.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, accompanied by State Department Special Cyprus
Coordinator Thomas Miller, will leave today for Ankara for
meetings with Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, Deputy Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit, Foreign Minister Ismail Cem and other
government officials.
</P>
<P>
This is Holbrooke's first visit to the island since his
appointment by Clinton as special envoy last June.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here speculated that the purpose of
Holbrooke's visit is to persuade the two Cypriot sides to make
compromise in forming a joint delegation for the European Union
accession negotiation with Cyprus, which will start next spring.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke was also trying to reduce tension on the
island triggered by the Cypriot government's decision to
purchase Russian-made S-300 surface-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot south and Turkish
Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkey sent troops and took over
the northern third of the island following a failed Athen-backed
coup.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG, S. Leone Junta Meet on Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Peace talks between Sierra
Leone's military junta and the commander of the west African
peace-keeping force (ECOMOG) began today as scheduled in Kosuh,
Freetown, on details of how to restore civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the talks will be on how the military hands over
power to President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah who was ousted in the May
25 coup this year, said Col. Godwin Ugbo, spokesman for Nigeria's
defense headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the junta, Major Johnny Paul Koroma, will also
discuss with ECOMOG Force Commander Major-General Victor Malu on
modalities to implement the peace accord signed in Conakry,
Guinea last month.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the junta is to step down in April next
year.
</P>
<P>
On top of the agenda will also be such issues as a cease fire
between ECOMOG and the junta forces, the economic sanctions
imposed by west African countries and the United Nations, and the
settlement of returned refugees, Ugbo said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the situation in Freetown is conducive for
the talks because "there has been no exchange of fire since the
accord".
</P>
<P>
Another major issue at the negotiation table is the
disarmament of combatants in Sierra Leone, who include the
Kamajors, the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and the armed
forces of Sierra Leone, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Kamajors are a group of traditional hunters who fight for
President Kabbah, while RUF is a rebel group which has fought
successive governments of the country since 1991.
</P>
<P>
About 6,000 RUF fighters reportedly joined the Sierra Leonean
army shortly after the coup.
</P>
<P>
Koroma has said earlier that the ECOMOG could not disarm the
armed forces of Sierra Leone because it is the legitimate army of
the country.
</P>
<P>
This is expected to be one of the crucial issue during the
talks.
</P>
<P>
Koroma has also called for the release of Foday Sankoh, the
RUF leader who has been under house arrest in Nigeria since March
this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Ugbo, Sankoh could be released but it depends on
the outcome of the negotiation.

<HEADLINE> Moi Urges Concession Between Sudanese Warring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi today called on both Sudanese warring parties to make
concessions to find a lasting solution of their conflicts.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it was prudent that they make concessions and
abandon their intransigent stance as a way forward.
</P>
<P>
Moi made the remarks here when he met with delegations of the
Sudanese government and the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA)
which have held peace talks in Nairobi since October 27.
</P>
<P>
Moi, who is the Chairman of the Committee of Heads of State
and Government dealing with southern Sudan conflict, noted that
southern Sudanese problems could not be solved through military
means.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan President who is also the Chairman of the
Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) pointed out
that he was totally committed to the peaceful settlement of the
Sudanese conflict.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued after the meeting by Kenyan Foreign
Minister Kalonzo Musyoka who has chaired the peace talks, both
sides of the conflict accepted that a military solution could not
bring lasting peace and stability to Sudan.
</P>
<P>
They reaffirmed their commitment to the IGAD-brokered peace
initiatives and said that negotiations would continue under its
auspices.
</P>
<P>
Musyoka said the IGAD subcommittee decided that the peace
talks "should adjourn and resume in April 1998, to give ample
time for the two sides to consult with their respective
headquarters".
</P>
<P>
"In the intervening period special envoys will conduct shuttle
diplomacy between Khartoum and the Headquarters of the SPLA to
narrow the gap on the issues," he added.
</P>
<P>
During the closed-door talks sponsored by the IGAD, the SPLA
proposed a referendum on self-determination for south Sudan after
two years, with a confederation between north and south in the
interim period.
</P>
<P>
Khartoum accepted the principle of self-determination as a
means of resolving the 14-year conflict, but proposed a
north-south federation in stead of confederation.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the two sides stalled in 1994 when the
Sudanese government refused to accept a declaration containing
the principle of self-determination for south Sudan, but a
combination of military defeats and diplomatic pressure forced
the government back to the negotiating table last September.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG, Liberia Dispute over Border Deployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- There has been a new dispute
between the west African peace-keeping force (ECOMOG) and the
Liberian government over the deployment of security forces along
the Liberian-Sierra Leone border.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have disputed over the restructuring of the
Liberian armed forces as the Liberian government plans to do the
job by itself.
</P>
<P>
Speaking with delegates from the European Union last night in
Monrovia, capital of Liberia, ECOMOG Force Commander
Major-General Victor Malu rejected the Liberian government's plan
to deploy armed Liberians to the country's western border.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG is mandated by west African leaders to take
responsibility of Liberia's security after the newly-elected
government was put in place.
</P>
<P>
Malu said that to avoid clashes he will be compelled to
withdraw his force from the border if the Liberian government
insists on deploying armed elements there.
</P>
<P>
"I have no intention of allowing clashes to break up there
during my tenure," Malu said, quoted by the British Broadcasting
Corporation today.
</P>
<P>
He said with the presence of ECOMOG and Liberia's armed
elements in one place, it resulted in fighting in Monrovia more
than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Malu pointed out that since last June's heavy concentration of
ECOMOG troops along the Liberia-Sierra Leone border, there has
never been any threat to Liberia's security.
</P>
<P>
He said he was not aware of the sources of all the arms the
government has been issuing to Liberian security forces, adding
that it appeared imaginary insecurity at the border is being used
as an excuse to give weapons to the people the government wants
to re-arm.
</P>
<P>
Malu firmly denounced this re-armament, saying that it was
being done in disregard to the peace agreement that has brought
peace to the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement signed in August last year in
Abuja, capital of Nigeria, ECOMOG will be involved in the
restructuring and training of the Liberian armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Liberian President Charles Taylor announced last month his
government would single-handedly re-organize an armed force of
1,000.
</P>
<P>
Taylor's Defense Minister Daniel Chea also said the Abuja
peace agreement which calls the ECOMOG involvement in the
formation of the new Liberian army had ceased to exist with the
coming into power of the Charles Taylor-led government.

<HEADLINE> Russian Official Praises Results of Yeltsin's China Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 11 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin's China
visit proved that Russian-Chinese ties "are stably developing in
the channel of equal partnership based on mutual confidence and
aimed at strategic interaction in the 21st century," Russian
Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Tarasov said today.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov said at a press briefing that during the visit, the
Russian and Chinese presidents exchanged views on bilateral
relations and international problems and signed a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
The two sides settled all essential issues related to
demarcation of the Russian-Chinese state border in its eastern
part (over 4,200 kilometers) done in accordance with the agreement
of May 16, 1991, and confirmed their readiness to do the
demarcation work in the western part of the Russian-Chinese border
(55 kilometers) in coordinated time.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the two leaders expressed
satisfaction with the mounting positive dynamics in relations
between Russia, China, the United States and Japan achieved during
recent summit contacts.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed to and called for a multipolar world and
said the time of unions aimed against third countries as well as
strategic "polygons" has gone.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov also said that the two sides paid much attention to
boosting of trade and economic cooperation. They noted the need
for a fuller use of their potential in such spheres as oil, gas,
nuclear power engineering, transport, communication and peaceful
use of outer space.
</P>
<P>
The visit resulted in signing of eight bilateral documents.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president visited China on November 9-11. It was
the third time for Yeltsin to visit Beijing since he was elected
Russian president, and was also his fifth meeting with Chinese
leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Russian and Chinese leaders reached an agreement to hold
their next summit in an informal atmosphere in Russia, Tarasov
said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Keen on Settling Iraq-US Crisis: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Jordan today expressed its
keenness to see the current crisis between Iraq and the United
States settled as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Information Affairs Samir Mutawe made
the expression in a report at today`s regular cabinet meeting,
Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz is now in the United
Nations to seek ways to terminate the standoff with the United
States incurred by Iraq's decision on October 29 to expel all
the U.S. inspectors in the U.N. weapons inspection teams in
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Jordan urged to end the sufferings of the Iraqi people caused
by the U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in
1990, Mutawe said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the kingdom also urged Baghdad to comply with all
the U.N. Security Council resolutions concerning it, the
minister added.
</P>
<P>
Since Iraq announced the ban last month, Jordan has been
adopting a balanced attitude toward the issue, as both King
Hussein and Crown Prince Hassan said that the crisis should be
ended in a way that would guarantee the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Iraq as well as pave the way for
implementation of U.N. Security Council's resolutions and the
lifting of the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has barred U.N. weapons inspections teams that included
Americans for an eighth day. It has charged that the
U.S. inspectors are spies trying to prolong the U.N. sanctions.

<P>
LUSAKA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Zambia today reiterated its
support to the promotion of Angola's peace and stability,
according to a television report by Zambia News Broadcasting
Corporation Limited (ZNBC).
</P>
<P>
Officiating at the Angolan 22nd independence anniversary in
the capital today, David Mpamba, minister of information and
broadcasting services, said that Zambia will continue to support
all the political processes to bring about peace and stability in
Angola in accordance with the 1994 Lusaka peace protocol for that
country.
</P>
<P>
Mpamba said that it is only through conditions of peace and
stability that people can devote their time, energies and
resources that could address social, economic and political
challenges.
</P>
<P>
People of Angola, said the minister, like all the people in
the sub-region and Africa as a whole, "deserve unconditional
peace and stability to forge ahead in bringing economic and
political dispensation."
</P>
<P>
He added that all the African countries need peace to go ahead
in order to win economic independence in the region.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Manuel Augusto, Angolan ambassador to
Zambia, called for the support of the international community to
ensure that the Lusaka agreement is realized in full.
</P>
<P>
He said with such support, the agreement will be fully
implemented to enable Angola to pursue developmental activities
successfully.
</P>
<P>
On November 20, 1994, the Angolan government and the
anti-government organization UNITA signed a ceasefire agreement
in Lusaka in a bid to make peace in Angola which has suffered a
civil war since mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
However, the agreement has not been implemented smoothly and
periodic fightings between the two sides continue.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Carol Bellamy,
executive director of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF),
today condemned the detention of two UNICEF staff members by the
Taliban, a warring faction of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The two UNICEF staff members were detained by the Taliban in
Jalalabad on November 8. No concrete reason was offered for the
detention. The staff were taken to a public place where one man
was given 10 lashes in front of a crowd of onlookers. His
colleague managed to escape.
</P>
<P>
"The treatment of UNICEF staff is unacceptable affront to the
most fundamental principles of humanitarianism," said Bellamy in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"UNICEF cannot and will not accept the intimidation and abuse
of staff who are working to provide for the needs of children
within a humanitarian framework. Such actions by the authorities
contravene long-established international protocols and
conventions for the protection of United Nations personnel
throughout the world," said Bellamy.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Former Security Head Warns About Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 11 (Xinhua) -- A former Israeli security
head warned today that another political assassination is
possible because of the deepening division among Israeli society
two years after the killing of late prime minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
Yaakov Peri, former head of General Security Service (GSS),
sounded the alarm in his report to the Knesset (Parliament)
Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. He said threats come from
both the left and right wings, and the GSS has to cope with them
seriously to prevent another tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Asked if another political murder is possible in light of the
current tense political atmosphere, Peri replied: "Yes, because
of the environment, because of the debate which we're
having... we have to do our utmost in order to prevent it," he
told Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Peri's grim assessment of the situation coincided with the
second anniversary of the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin that
began this evening according to the Jewish calendar.
</P>
<P>
Rabin was shot dead by a radical Jew named Yigal Amir on
November 4, 1995, at a political rally in Tel Aviv. The leftists
have been blaming Rabin's murder on the rightist camp led by
current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Leading opposition leaders are demanding for an official
apology from Netanyahu for his role in fanning the incitement
that led to Rabin's assassination.
</P>
<P>
At the biggest ever political rally held last Saturday in Tel
Aviv's Rabin Square where Rabin was killed, 200,000 leftists
gathered to remember Rabin and attacked Netanyahu for his
refusal to apologize. Some posted placards saying "We'll not
forget, We'll not forgive."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a public debate between the left and right on a
conspiracy theory surrounding Rabin's death reached a feverish
peak in recent days, as the two sides sparred over the role
played by former GSS agent Avishai Raviv in inciting Amir to
kill Rabin.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided to publish Wednesday some
secret sections of the report compiled by the committee
appointed to probe Rabin's assassination two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Raviv, a problematic agent who infiltrated extreme rightist
groups and was a close friend of Amir, was charged by the
rightist camp for organizing the incitement campaign against
Rabin. Some ministers within the current right-wing government
have called for conducting new investigation into Raviv's role
and bringing him to trial.
</P>
<P>
However, the left wing denounced the right wing for plotting
to shift its responsibility for Rabin's death by placing the
blame on the back of Raviv.
</P>
<P>
Peri, who retired before Rabin's killing, defended the GSS in
employing such controversial figure like Raviv. He criticized
the right wing's exaggeration of Raviv's role in Rabin's murder,
saying no one should put all the blame on Raviv because his
provocative actions were approved by the GSS in a cautious
manner.
</P>
<P>
Senior police commander Avi Cohen agreed with Peri's
assessment that another political assassination in Israel is
possible because of the current tension. He said although there
are no outright signs now, "the smell of another political
assassination is in the air."
</P>
<P>
In the first sign pointing to the security warnings, Benny
Elon, leader of the ultra-rightist Moledet party, received a
death threat today contained in an envelope addressed to him
with a bullet inside.

<HEADLINE> Iran Concerned About Tension in Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran today expressed concern
over the rising factional conflicts and the Turkish incursion in
northern Iraq, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Iran is against the rising tensions in northern Iraq as well as
the expansion of the Turkish army's operations in the war-torn
region, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi was
quoted by the agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi, who is currently accompanying Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi for a visit to the Gulf region, noted that
the Turkish military intervention in the conflicts between the two
Kurdish rival factions in northern Iraq would further complicate
the already complex situation.
</P>
<P>
This would lead to destruction and bloodshed in the region and
force civilians to seek refuge inside the Iranian territory, he
said, warning that Iran has insufficient resources to host more
refugees in the upcoming winter season.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Turkish army to refrain from interfering in the
conflicts between the two Iraqi Kurdish groups, adding that Turkey
should pull back its forces from the Iraqi territory.
</P>
<P>
Fresh fightings erupted in the past few days between the
pro-Iranian Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and pro-Baghdad
Kurdistan's Democratic Party (KDP), forcing many Kurdish people to
flee from the region bordering Iran.
</P>
<P>
More than 60,000 Iraqi Kurds fled into the Iranian territory
in September last year when the KDP forces pushed the PUK to the
Iranian border areas.
</P>
<P>
Several thousands of the Iraqi Kurdish people are still
living in Iran's refugee camps. It is believed that more Iraqi
Kurdish refugees would enter Iran if the factional fighting
continues.

<HEADLINE> Iran Blames Azerbaijan for Exploitation in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran today blamed Azerbaijan
for its "unilateral exploitation" in the Caspian Sea, saying that
the unilateral measure would bring chaos and discord to the
region.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official news agency IRNA quoted a Foreign
Ministry official for legal affairs as saying that Azerbaijan's
measure would trigger an adverse repercussion in other littoral
states of the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Azerbaijan would formally inaugurate its
oil exploration operation at Cheragh area in the Caspian Sea
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The official said the resources of the Caspian Sea belong to
all the littoral states and any extraction of the resources and
the utility of its facilities needed to be approached through
international conventions and a legal approach unanimously
approved by the Caspian Sea littoral states.
</P>
<P>
Any unilateral action to be taken by Azerbaijan in exploiting
the resources of the Caspian Sea is in contradiction with the
"1921 Amity Convention" and the "Commercial and Sea-faring
Convention of 1940" signed by Iran and former Soviet Union,
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Azerbaijan, as one of the newly independent
republics of former Soviet Union, has legally bound itself to the
commitments of former Soviet Union by signing the "1991 Almaty
Declaration."
</P>
<P>
The Caspian Sea is reported to have proven reserves of 16
billion barrels of crude oil and 8.3 trillion barrels of natural
gas.
</P>
<P>
During the past years, Azerbaijan signed several contracts
with foreign companies to form a consortium to conduct oil
exploration and exploitation in the Caspian Sea, arousing sharp
criticism from other Caspian Sea states such as Iran.
</P>
<P>
Tehran stressed that a legal regime governing the Caspian Sea
should be reached unanimously by the five littoral states,
including Iran, Azerbaijan, Russia, Kazakhstan and
Turkmenistan.

<HEADLINE> Canada Has More Millionaires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The number of millionaires has
tripled in Canada since 1989, said a report today.
</P>
<P>
At present, the country has 220,000 people with investable
assets valued at more than 1 million dollars (710,000 US dollars),
1 percent of Canadian taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
And the number of Canadian millionaires is expected to triple
again by 2005, the Globe and Mail newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The investable assets are defined as savings or investments
that are liquid and controlled by the individual. This includes
items such as stocks and saving bonds, but does not include equity
in a house or a company pension plan.
</P>
<P>
More than half of Canadian millionaires earned their money
through inheritance or selling a business or property as opposed
to playing the stock market.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the percentage of millionaires who grew wealthy from the
stock market is expected to increase over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
In addition, as the baby boom generation ages, membership in
the million-dollar club will increase as boomers step up their
savings efforts and come into inheritance, the report said.
</P>
<P>
There are a number of Canadians currently sitting on
500,000-plus that they made playing the stock market and many of
these people will hit the 1-million-dollar mark soon, it added.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Egypt Asserts Independence on Doha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today declared its
non-participation at a controversial economic conference in a move
to underscore its independence as against the favor of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
After months of waiting and seeing, President Hosni Mubarak
said today that Egypt will not send any delegation to the fourth
Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Economic Conference and, at
the best, its ambassador to Doha might attend the inaugural
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"Every state adopts its own decision based on its own
assessment and its sovereignty," Mubarak said. And Egypt's
decision took into consideration the benefits to be gained through
holding the conference either by the state or the whole Arab
nation, he said.
</P>
<P>
By doing so, Egypt not merely sent a protest note to Washington
for its biased policy toward Israel, but also retained the dignity
of the Arab nations outraged by the hardline Israeli government,
observers said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., though apparently failed to pressure Israel into
implementing unfulfilled peace agreements and stopping
controversial settlement activities, has pushed Egypt hard to show
up at the annual gathering.
</P>
<P>
The first tour of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to
the region in September, expected to breathe new life to the peace
process, only turned out to be a selling pitch for Doha.
</P>
<P>
However, disheartened by the peace crisis going into the eighth
month, Egypt said its participation would hinge on progress on the
peace process and it cannot make a decision against the will of
the Arab people, even if at the risk of losing U.S. favor.
</P>
<P>
When most Arab states have either flatly rejected the
conference or threatened to boycott it, Egypt decided to wait for
any breakthrough while consulting Arab brothers. Of the 16 Arab
countries invited, only four promised to come.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, Egypt concerted steps with leaders of the
United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Oman, held talks
with Russian, Canadian and European diplomats, exchanged views
with the U.S. undersecretary. Egyptian Ambassador to Qatar was
recalled for consultations.
</P>
<P>
And finally it was told today by the Palestinian negotiating
team in Cairo that the Washington-backed talks with Israel was
futile.
</P>
<P>
No Egyptian delegation or businessmen will show up at Doha. But
to maintain "a minimum level of contacts" with the host Qatar,
Cairo said it will send back the ambassador this week and he might
go to the inaugural ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, however frustrated with the peace process, asserts its
role as an Arab leader, an honor so far largely limited to hosting
pan-Arab meetings and issuing appeals, observers said.
</P>
<P>
As the Arab camp is divided over the MENA conference, the
belated Egyptian decision is expected to discourage those still
hesitant to go to Doha.
</P>
<P>
It also gave a relief to those who had in private complained
that Egypt cannot do without the U.S. guidance in view of
Washington's annual 2-billion-dollar assistance to Egypt.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG, S. Leone Junta to Continue Talks Tomorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping
force (ECOMOG) and Sierra Leone's military junta have decided to
continue their peace talks tomorrow at the end of today's meeting
which was held in a "good atmosphere".
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting, which had to be postponed from last Friday
because of disagreement on the venue, was attended by the ECOMOG
team headed by Force Commander Major-General Victor Malu and the
juta's group led Major Johnny Paul Koroma, the self-named head of
state, in Jui near the capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed, among the 17 items on the agenda, the
responsibility of ECOMOG in Sierra Leone, the British
Broadcasting Corporation reported today.
</P>
<P>
Other issues being discussed include the deployment of troops
in Freetown port, manning of checkpoints, arms control in
Freetown, free movement of civil servants, including personnel of
humanitarian services and non-governmental organization as well
as refugees and displaced persons.
</P>
<P>
They also talked about the deployment to enforce the embargo
imposed by west African countries and the United Nations, the
removal of land mines, opening of air and sea ports, UN
involvement and opening of borders.
</P>
<P>
According to Malu, he had actually given instructions to
ECOMOG troops in Sierra Leone to cooperate with soldiers of the
ruling Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC).
</P>
<P>
The two parties agreed to the release of Foday Sankoh, leader
of the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF), who has been
detained in Nigeria since March this year, and the disarmament of
combatants in the country.
</P>
<P>
About 6,000 RUF fighters reportedly joined the AFRC army after
the May 25 coup that ousted Sierra Leone's legitimate government
led by President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the Sierra Leone army and ECOMOG troops would
be deployed at strategic positions across Sierra Leone, as well
as mining areas and places of commercial or economic interest of
the country.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that the removal of mines should be started
immediately as well as the manning of checkpoints, while all arms
and combatants should be moved out of the city until the start of
the disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Malu was quoted as saying that the atmosphere of the meeting
was very good for confidence building.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tareq Aziz said here today that the Iraqi Government had
not changed its decision on banning Americans from U.N. weapons
inspection teams.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Aziz said, "I have not been given any
concrete promise that there will be a change in the position of
the Security Council of the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
"I, on my part, did not give a concrete promise for the change.
If you do not have a change on the part of the Security Council,
you cannot expect a change on the part of Iraq," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the American percentage of presence in the
inspection teams, Aziz said the Americans working in sensitive
United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) posts in the three
centers accounted for 44 percent last year and 32 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chileans manned and serviced UNSCOM's three
helicopters in Iraq and did not participate in the arms
inspection.
</P>

Aziz was responding to the remarks by Butler, the Chairman of
UNSCOM, who told reporters that Chileans were the largest group in
the arms inspection teams, accounting for 22 percent while

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Praised for Remarks of Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer
Weizman today praised Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
reconciliatory remarks as correct steps to tone down political
disputes.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a symposium on exports in Tel-Aviv, Weizman said
that efforts must be made to improve the political situations
because there is no alternative.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said what Netanyahu said is helpful for national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said Sunday at a convention of the Likud Group
that the opposition Labor Party has made historical achievements
for the country and called for national unity.
</P>
<P>
"The time has come to stop blaming one another. I want to
remind everyone..., that the Labor movement and the other
movements of the left have had many achievements in building the
state and enhancing its security," he said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has been accused by the leftists of inciting the
assassination of former Labor prime minister Yitzhak Rabin,
and created a political uproar by saying the leftists have
"forgotten what it is to be Jews."
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that Netanyahu is holding out the olive
branch to the leftists in an attempt to defuse the tensions
between the left and right.
</P>
<P>
But Israel's Labor Party leader Ehud Barak Monday rejected his
call for reconciliation, saying there is a gap between Netanyahu's
statements and deeds.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Three-Year Loan for Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) today announced the approval of a three-year loan for
Uganda under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF),
in an amount of equivalent to 138 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The loan is provided in support of the Ugandan government's
economic program for 1997/98 to 1999/2000. The first annual loan,
in an amount of about 55 million dollars, is made available in two
equal semiannual installments, and the first of which is available
immediately.
</P>
<P>
The principal objectives of the economic program, supported by
the ESAF loans, are to sustain high and broad-based economic
growth and ensure that the poor are able to participate in, and
benefit from, increased economic activity. The program is aimed to
achieve a real GDP growth rate of at least 7 percent a year on
average, reducing annual inflation to about 5 percent and
increasing gross international reserves to the equivalent of 4.9
months of imports of goods and nonfactor services.
</P>
<P>
At the core of the government's medium-term program is an
increase in the gross investment-to-GDP ratio to about 23 percent
in 1999/2000, and a reduction in the overall fiscal deficit by
about 1.7 percent of GDP over the program period.
</P>
<P>
The ESAF is a concessional IMF facility for assisting the
member countries that are undertaking economic reform programs to
strengthen their balance of payments and improve their growth
prospects. The loans carry an interest rate of 0.5 percent a year
and are repayable over 10 years with a 5.5 year grace period.
</P>
<P>
Uganda joined the IMF in September 1963. Its quota is about 185
million dollars and its outstanding use of IMF financing currently
totals about 380 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: No Delay for Resolving Iraqi Defiance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States is afraid
that "endless delay" for settlement of dispute over Iraq's
preventing U.N. arms inspection teams including Americans from
discharging their job could give its mortal foe time to rebuild
banned weapons program.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen told CNN in an interview on
Tuesday morning that "time is of the essence" for the United
Nations to pressure Iraq to comply with U.N. arms inspection
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq would not be able to reconstitute a serious weapons
program in a matter of days," Cohen said. But "if the delay were
to carry on for months then that would be a different situation."
</P>
<P>
"That's why time really is of the essence here... the longer
this goes on the longer he (Iraqi President Saddam Hussein) has an
opportunity to continue to build the kind of weapons that really
are banned and he should be precluded from doing so," he
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has barred U.N. weapons inspection teams for more than a
week, claiming it did so because Americans were included in the
the teams and they were collecting sensitive informations under
the guise of weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
The United States has repeatedly urged the United Nations to
take punitive measures as soon as possible on Iraq so that it
could be further restricted for its revival in its weapons
programs.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said Baghdad's continued defiance amounted to an
"endless delay," and any attempt on Iraq's part to seek dialogue
should be rejected as it gives the chance for such a delay.
</P>
<P>
"Endless delay, or his attempt to engage in dialogue, should
be rejected. This is not a dialogue, it's not a debate," he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the United States would take military action
against Iraq by moving warships and planes into the Persian Gulf
areas, Cohen said the Pentagon was considering several options
in dealing with Saddam Hussein's defiance towards the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We would be prepared, should it be necessary, to use
whatever resources we have available in order to bring about a
resolution of this," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen and Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, has postponed a 12-day trip to Asia so that he could be
directly involved in decision making on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"I postponed the trip at the request of President (Bill)
Clinton, who wanted his national security team to be available
to consult with should any sort of military action be necessary
in the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, however, said Washington first seeks diplomatic
solution before taking into consideration any possibility of
military action.
</P>
<P>
"We're seeking a diplomatic solution not a military solution
but obviously we would call upon a variety of our assets to carry
out a demand or a command on the part of the president of the
United States and in conjunction with the U.N. to carry out the
situation," he said.

YAOUNDE, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Cameroun's Minister of Women
and Social Affairs Yaou Aissatou has invited African women to
acquire the knowledge to be able to identify the violation of the
rights of the woman in their various areas.
</P>
<P>
According to Cameroun Tribune today, the minister made the
call here on Monday while opening an international seminar on the
protection and respect of woman's rights in Francophone Africa.
</P>
<P>
The minister underscored the reasons for the malpractices of
woman's rights tracing them to the customary laws, the
non-respect of existing laws, unprofessional conduct of legal
officials, discrimination and the relatively low literacy level
of women.
</P>
<P>
The women at the seminar are expected to arrive at solutions
to such nagging issues at the end of the seminar.
</P>
<P>
About 100 participants coming from 19 French speaking African
countries are taking part in the seminar.
</P>
<P>
The five-day seminar is jointly organized by the Canadian
Foundation for the Rights of People, the Canadian Cultural and
Technical Agency and the Canadian government as well as the
Camerounian government.

<HEADLINE> EU to Cope With Defense Industry Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BRUSSELS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
today adopted a strategy to deal with problems facing the European
defense industry.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the European defense-related industry is too
fragmented to be sustainable, the EU's executive agency, the
European Commission, adopted a strategy which is aimed at
effectively restructuring the industry.
</P>
<P>
The EU holds that a sharp decline in demand following the end of
the Cold War, as well as fierce competition from newly created
"giant" corporations in the United States, has put the future of
EU's defense industry at stake.
</P>
<P>
The strategy, initiated by EU Commissioners Martin
Bangemann and Hans Van den Broek, will list the problems emerging
in Europe's defense industry, which represents a gross turnover of
50 billion US dollars inside the EU, and employs some
700,000 people directly in member countries.
</P>
<P>
For the implementation of the strategy, the Commission also
recommended a dual approach: development of a European armaments
policy and an action plan for defense-related industries.
</P>
<P>
Defense-related industry is not only economically vital to the
EU's employment but also highly sensitive in political and
security fields, the commission said in a press release issued
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the International Institute for Strategic
Studies, the EU imports six times more defense-related goods from
the U.S. than it exports to the U.S., and the figure is
increasing.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras of the United States
defeated Greg Rusedski of Britain 6-4, 7-5 at the ATP World
Championships in Hanover, Germany on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The three-time holder at the end-of-season shootout had to lie
down on his bench during a changeover following the ninth game of
the opening set while holding a 5-4 lead over Canadian-born Briton
Rusedski, when he had a nose bleed.
</P>
<P>
ATP trainer Doug Spreen treated the 26-year-old Sampras and
after five minutes the contest resumed.
</P>
<P>
Sampras served out the set and carried on without problems. In
the second he broke Rusedski as the Briton double-faulted for the
eighth time in the match to give Sampras a pair of game-winning
points. One was all the American needed for a 6-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
A game later, it was all over after one hour, 16 minutes as
Sampras won from Rusedski's backhand into the net.
</P>
<P>
The victory gives Sampras a 1-1 record in round-robin play in
the Red group. He will now await the result of Wednesday night's
match between Patrick Rafter and Carlos Moya, both undefeated so
far.
</P>
<P>
Moya beat Sampras on Tuesday in an upset to put the holder in
trouble. The win over Rusedski was the sixth for Sampras in the
series without a defeat.
</P>
<P>
In the White group, Yevgeny Kafelnikov was facing Swede Jons
Bjorkman.
</P>
<P>
The top two in each group qualify for Saturday's semi-finals.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Legislative Election Regulation Takes Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 12 (Xinhua) -- A regulation related to the
forthcoming legislative elections in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, proposed by the Electoral Affairs
Commission (EAC) and tabled at the Provisional Legislative
Council, came into effect today.
</P>
<P>
The document, entitled The EAC "(Registration) (Electors for
Functional Constituencies) (Voters for Subsectors) (Members of
Election Committee) (Legislative Council) Regulation," governs the
registration of electors for functional constituencies, voters for
the Election Committee subsectors and members of the Election
Committee.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the EAC said today: "We hope to enable the
registration work for functional constituencies and Election
Committee subsectors to start as soon as possible, given that the
registration for electors in geographical constituencies has
already started last Wednesday (November 5)."
</P>
<P>
The publication of the regulation in an extraordinary gazette
Monday would give as much time as possible to eligible persons and
bodies to be registered as electors-voters for functional
constituencies and the Election Committee before the registration
deadline set for January 16, 1998, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the main features of the regulation, he said that
the regulation provides a simplified procedure for registration by
way of a notification procedure.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the registration system works and to guard against
misuse of the information obtained by the Electoral and
Registration Officer for non-election purposes, the regulation
sets out various offenses, the spokesman said. The offenses
include:
</P>
<P>
-- making a false statement in relation to voter registration;
</P>
<P>
-- conspiring with, inciting, compelling, inducing, coercing,
intimidating or persuading another person to make such a false
statement;
</P>
<P>
-- obtaining information from a register or extracts of a
register and using it for a purpose other than in relation to the
election or imparting it to another person; and
</P>
<P>
-- failing to furnish information in response to a requirement
within the specified period.
</P>
<P>
The EAC, chaired by Justice Woo Kwok-hing, was established in
late September.
</P>
<P>
Under another legislative election-related regulation, which
was tabled at the Provisional Legislative Council last Wednesday,
30 of the 60 seats in the future legislature will be returned by
30 business and professional groups known as "functional
constituencies."
</P>
<P>
One-third of the seats will be returned by geographical
constituencies through proportional representation, and the
remaining 10 elected by an 800-member Election Committee.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier speech, Chief Executive of the SAR Tung Chee Hwa
said that the first legislative elections scheduled for next May
would be right on schedule and he pledged that they would be open,
fair and acceptable to people in the SAR.

ISLAMABAD, November 12 (Xinhua) -- President of Union Texas
Pakistan (UTP) A. G. Hoffman today termed the killing of five of
its employees including four U.S. citizens as "terrible and
tragic."
</P>
<P>
Hoffman said in a statement issued in Karachi that the company
does not know the reason behind this attack and UTP is fully
cooperating with local officials in their investigations.

The four U.S. citizens and the Pakistani driver were gunned
down by some unidentified assailants at around 8:20 this morning
on their way from Karachi Sheraton Hotel to their office about

<HEADLINE> EU Adopts Plan for Free movement of Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BRUSSELS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive body, today set out a comprehensive
action plan to improve the conditions for the free movement of
workers within the EU.
</P>
<P>
The EU needed to "take decisive action" to deal with the
problem though the main European rules on free movement of workers
were adopted almost 20 years ago, Padraig Flynn, EU commissioner for
employment and social affairs, said Wednesday in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The action plan will focus on areas such as improving existing
legislation, making the European labor market more transparent,
enhancing cooperation with and between national authorities and
social partners and giving greater visibility to the right of free
movement.
</P>
<P>
The Commission's strategy builds on the recommendations made
last March by a high-level panel on free movement of people, which
highlights the importance of labor mobility in the proper
functioning of the envisaged Single Market and in the promotion of a
skilled, trained and adaptable workforce.

<P>
KATHMANDU, November 12 (Xinhua) -- President of the Swiss
Confederation Arnold Koller left here today for Vietnam, after
concluding a four-day official visit to Nepal.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Nepal, Koller held official talks with
Nepali Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa. Koller said the Swiss
government would like to play the role of mediator to help resolve
the long-standing issue of Bhutanese refugees.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Bhutanese refugees have been staying in eastern
Nepal after being forced to flee Bhutan in 1989 and the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
Nepal had asked India to help resolve the issue, but India
refused, saying it is a bilateral one.
</P>
<P>
Koller also said the Swiss government plans to provide yearly
assistance of some 20 million Swiss francs (14.93 million U.S.
dollars) in a five-year period starting 1997.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the first ever by a Swiss head of state, the
two sides signed two agreements under which Switzerland will grant
some 3.41 million dollars to Nepal for building suspension
bridges.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland provides aid to Nepal mainly in transport,
vocational training and rural development.
</P>
<P>
After Vietnam, the Swiss president will visit Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Accords Reached to Bring S. Leone Back to Normal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Commander of the West
African Peace Keeping Force (ECOMOG) Victor Malu and military
officials in the Sierra Leone Army reached a number of agreements
Tuesday after day-long talks.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua at the end of the meeting, Malu
said, "we are well on our way to bringing Sierra Leone back to
normal after the May 25 coup."
</P>
<P>
He said the country's ferry service, which links the mainland
with the international airport will resume soon and that ECOMOG
troops "will shortly be deployed in specific areas to enforce the
embargo in such a way that will not bring hardship to the people
of Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
The land mines at the airport, he said, will be removed and
humanitarian food supplies will be allowed into the country as
from Friday.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of food now at the border with Guinea and the
agencies are waiting for the green light from us to come in," he
said.
</P>
<P>
On the list of discussions at the talks, he said, "the sea and
airports are to be re-opened soon and Sierra Leone prisoners of
war are to be released to the International Committee of the Red
Cross and the Catholic mission as from tomorrow (Wednesday)."
</P>
<P>
"There are however three key issues that require further
discussions by the Committee of Five" of the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS), said Malu.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS assigned Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Cote d'Ivoire and
Liberia as the Committee of Five to hold talks with Sierra Leone
junta for handing over power back to elected President T. Kabbah.
The junta toppled Kabbah's government in a May coup.
</P>
<P>
Malu listed the issues as "the return of Corporal Foray
Sankoh, an observation on who should be disarmed and the dominant
role of Nigeria in ECOMOG."
</P>
<P>
"We have asked the military government in Sierra Leone to
immediately start reopening the roads and dismantle unnecessary
checkpoints which will later be manned by a joint Sierra Leone
army and ECOMOG soldiers," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Malu said that three committees on disarmament, cease fire and
humanitarian agencies would be set up within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed on ECOMOG deployment in Freetown which
includes the seaports, airports and other selected vulnerable
points and strategic installations including guarding the
facilities of the U.N. agencies and non-governmental
organizations in conjunction with the Sierra Leone army," he
said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman with the Sierra Leone military delegation said
they have accepted the agreement "in principle" and that "further
discussions were necessary to put them into gear."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, residents in the capital welcomed the agreement,
with many calling it "a forward move for peace and security" in
Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Trial Journey of Sped Up Train Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 12 (Xinhua) -- China has been successful in
a trial journey of a high-speed train.
</P>
<P>
A high-speed train left Shanghai at 9:45 a.m. today on a maiden
voyage and arrived in Hangzhou at 11:41 a.m. It headed for Ningbo
after a 45-minute stop and arrived there at 3:03 p.m.
</P>
<P>
The train cut 50 minutes off the previous time by running at
120 kilometers per hour from Shanghai to Hangzhou, and 110
kilometers per hour from Hangzhou to Ningbo.
</P>
<P>
This was the second run of a high-speed train. The first, from
Shanghai to Nanjing, started on April 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The high-speed trains are expected to take business away from
the Hangzhou-Ningbo expressway, which opened to automobiles at the
end of last year, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou expressway, which is
expected to be operational in the second half of next year.

<HEADLINE> Mercedes Urges to End Debate over A-Class Car's Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Daimler-Benz, maker of the new
small Mercedes A-Class car, made full-page advertizements in 180
German papers today in an unprecedented move to calm down debate
over the safety of the car, which turned over during a test in
Sweden last month.
</P>
<P>
It said in the advertisement: "We want to end the discussion
about the safety of the A-Class, once and for all."
</P>
<P>
The company said that it regretted that tests had highlighted a
weakness of the subcompact car and that it wanted to gain
confidence of the customers.
</P>
<P>
In Sweden last month, the Mercedes A-Class car rolled over when
taking a sharp turn to avoid obstacles during the test known as
the "elk test", which is designed to see how a car reacts when
avoiding suddenly-appeared obstacles.
</P>
<P>
"Please give us time and exercise some patience even if you
think the measures are somewhat excessive", said Daimler-Benz in
the advertizement.
</P>
<P>
The parent company of carmaker Mercedes-Benz Tuesday announced
that it was halting the delivery of the new A-Class car for 12
weeks for modifications of the model.
</P>
<P>
It said that all future A-Class cars would have different tyres
and an electronic suspension regulation system called ESP.
</P>
<P>
The modifications would also be applied to the 3,000 sold
models free of charge.
</P>
<P>
Daimler-Benz said that it had written to 200,000 customers and
potential buyers of the A-Class to explain the measures.

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM Continues Gulf Tour In Qatar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi arrived the Qatari capital Doha this morning on a
brief visit as part of his tour in the Gulf region to loosen
Tehran's long-term strained relations with its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
It was the first travel for the Iranian minister since he took
his post in August.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari news agency said that upon his arrival, Kharrazi
hold talks with senior Qatari officials on bilateral relations
and discussed issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Non-Arab Iran has been trying to reach out to its Arab
neighbors across the Gulf since Iran's President Mohammad Khatami
formed a new government in August.
</P>
<P>
It is also making efforts to remove decades-old hostilities
against Tehran held by the Arab world, in particular by the Gulf
Arab countries. Iranian officials have described improved ties
with the Arab world as among Tehran's top priorities.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister's tour came one month before the
Iran-hosted December 9 to 11 meeting of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
Iran feverishly hopes to make the meeting an unprecedented
gathering of foreign dignitaries. Around 50 heads of states,
including the Gulf Arab countries have been invited to the
convention.
</P>
<P>
Qatar is the fifth leg of Kharrazi's tour which has taken him
to Syria, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Bahrain. He will leave Doha
tonight for Oman and UAE to continue his tour.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Firm on Diplomatic Ties With China: Nzo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is firm on
the establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's
Republic of China and wishes to foster closer cooperative ties,
Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo said in Cape Town today.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela announced on November
27, 1996 that his country would sever ties with Taiwan and
recognize the People's Republic of China by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said future cooperation between South Africa and China
should cover not only political and diplomatic spheres, but also
economic, trade, investment and other fields, officials with a
visiting Chinese delegation told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting with a Chinese trade and economic mission, Nzo
said China had firmly supported the Southern African peoples in
their struggle for national independence and liberation and in
their fight against apartheid.
</P>
<P>
At present, China maintains close relations with the majority
of Southern African countries, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said South Africa also hopes that friendship and
cooperation between China and the Southern African Development
Community would be further enhanced, in addition to the good ties
between Beijing and Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Chinese delegation, Shi Guangsheng, appreciated
the stance of the South African government on its diplomatic
recognition of China.
</P>
<P>
Shi is the deputy chief of China's Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said the visit of such a large Chinese delegation on the
eve of the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two
countries demonstrated the constructive attitude of the Chinese
government toward the development of friendship and cooperation
with South Africa.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, he said, businessmen of the two countries
held fruitful discussions, which showed a great potential and
bright prospects in economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Shi hoped that the potential would be given a full play and
economic and trade cooperation could develop more quickly after
the establishment of diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
He said the development of cooperation between the two sides
are not only conducive to the economic development of the two
countries, thus benefiting the two peoples, but also to the
enhancement of cooperation between China and Africa, especially
Southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Shi also conveyed to Nzo the greetings from Chinese vice
premier and foreign minister, Qian Qichen.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation, made up of major trade and economic
officials and representatives of about 55 leading Chinese
enterprises, arrived in Johannesburg on November 5 for an 11-day
tour.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, 18 contracts and protocols totaling 540 million
U.S. Dollars were signed between companies of the two countries.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Doha Conference, A Tale of Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 12 (Xinhua) -- To be or not to be at the Doha
regional economic conference has been the question grinding Arab
countries for months. But on the eve of the opening, many came out
to say no.
</P>
<P>
Yet, behind the question is the fact that the stalled
Middle East peace process is seriously threatening the fate of
the three-year-old Middle East and North Africa (MENA) economic
cooperation process marked by annual conferences.
</P>
<P>
The MENA Doha conference, the fourth in a series, is facing
the strongest ever boycott camp which comprises of about half of
the Arab countries led by regional powers Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Arabs regard the gathering, which includes Israelis, as a
reward to the Netanyahu government's hardline policy held
responsible for bogging down the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The apparently sagging atmosphere accompanying the boycott
presents a striking contrast with that at the first Casablanca
summit in 1994 which was meant for a bright Arab-Israeli economic
cooperation, observers noted.
</P>
<P>
The economic cooperation process, a spinoff of the breakthrough
in the peace process, also went well at the Amman summit in 1995,
but suffered a setback and was downgraded to a ministerial level
at the last Cairo meeting as the result of the protest against the
new Israeli Likud government's hardline policy towards peace.
</P>
<P>
The Doha conference, however, is being held in an even worse
situation as the mideast peace process has been at the lowest ebb
since initiated four years ago. Many Arab countries adopted a
wait-and-see stance and condition their attendance on any peace
progress by Israel - a chance that did not come.
</P>
<P>
The boycott came as a blow to the United States, a chief
sponsor of the two processes, for its widely-accused biased policy
in favor of the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, toured the region for the past few months to boost
the conference. They said exchanges between the Israeli economy
and those of Arabs - which are considered highly complementary
to each other - will serve as an impetus to the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. also was the first to register its attendance in an
apparent move to counter Arabs' call for a postponement, a mass
boycott or cancellation of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the root of the dispute over the Doha conference is
the clash of two philosophies on the peace process: an
Arab-Israeli economic cooperation process fuels the peace process
as favored by the U.S. and Israel, and the inverse thinking by
many Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Arab analysts said that any trade-without-peace practice will
only benefit Israel -- a country geographically beleagured and
economically blocked by its Arab neighbors -- with an open
Arab market to its long-cherished wish, while Arabs gain nothing
in return.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it undermines the decades-long Arab collective
economic sanctions against Israel, thus depriving Arabs' of
bargaining chips in peace negotiations, they said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, reasons for boycott are backed by economic
considerations. Firstly, Arabs have shown more enthusiasm with an
economic integration of their own rather than the Arab-Israeli
cooperation. Secondly, the regional economic cooperation process
has hardly yielded tangible fruits for other complex reasons
than those regarding the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Arab countries which have announced to come -- merely
for investment opportunities and access to technologies badly
needed in the region -- have either hinted a low level
representation or vowed to use the meeting to criticize the
Israeli policies.
</P>
<P>
Only three Arab countries besides the host have announced
their attendance, namely Yemen, Jordan and Kuwait. Oman, which
had promised to come, now says it is not a final decision.
</P>
<P>
This means that the actual Arab presentation at the Doha
conference would hardly maintain at the already downgraded
ministerial level and the political discussion on regional
economic framework on the agenda would have to be adjusted.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Arab economic daily World Today said Tuesday that the
Doha meeting has failed even before its opening. Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak said the Doha gathering would achieve
nothing and be "meaningless."
</P>
<P>
In defiance of the protest, however, Qatar said the conference
must go ahead, stressing on the economic benefit to the region as
a whole to be brought about by a galaxy of world businessmen and
investors expected to be drawn to attendance.
</P>
<P>
But the real question, many Arab analysts pointed out, is that
without progress in peace process and the ensuing Arabs'
cooperation, the economic cooperation process set forward in
Casablanca summit for a prosperous region based on the
Arab-Israeli rapport is doomed to tail away.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Train More Former Muslim Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine military will
start next week to train more selected members of a former major
rebel group to step up its integration into the country's Armed
Forces, a military spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of some 1,200 members of the Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF) started their six-month training this June
and will complete their basic army course next month, said Captain
Slih Indanan, spokesman for Southern Command based in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Indanan said the next batch of MNLF trainees were previously
screened last April along with the first batch and they will also
take the basic six-month course before induction into the army.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF, the then largest Muslim rebel group in the country,
signed a landmark peace agreement with the government in September
last year, ending nearly three decade bloody war in the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, 5,500 MNLF fighters will be integrated
into the military and another 1,500 into the national police
force.
</P>
<P>
The integration process, vital for a lasting peace in the
southern Philippines, had experienced delays for lack of
educational qualification of some MNLF members to qualify as law
enforcers, and lack of budget allocation.
</P>
<P>
The government earlier decided to provide educational
scholarships to qualified MNLF members so they can be trained soon
and allocate more fund to step up the integration process.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Sets Dec. 29 for General Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chairman of the Electoral
Commission Zacchaeus Chesoni announced here today that Kenya's
presidential and parliamentary elections will be held on December
29.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, he said that all political parties must
finalize nomination of their parliamentary candidates on or
before December 7.
</P>
<P>
Presidential candidates must hand in their nomination papers
on December 3 and 4, Chesoni added.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the electoral commission announced the
election date only two days after Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi dissolved the 7th Parliament last Monday.
</P>
<P>
President Moi noted on December 10 that the program for the
general elections would be announced by the electoral commission
which is in charge of setting the timetable for nominations and
campaigning under the Kenya Constitution.
</P>
<P>
As Kenya's president must also be an MP, there must be a
parliamentary election to go along with a presidential poll.
</P>
<P>
Moi, 74 and in power since 1978, has already been formally
nominated by the ruling Kenya African National Union as
presidential candidate and is viewed as a favorite in the general
elections.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the announcement ended months of
speculation over Kenya's election date which has caused
uncertainty in business sectors.
</P>
<P>
Chesoni said that political parties would be given 23 days to
nominate their candidates who would have 20 instead of the
minimum 14 days to campaign after formal nomination.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Release More Funds to Counter El Nino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today announced that he will release more funds to address
the problems caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
At his regular press conference at the Presidential Palace,
Ramos ordered Defense Secretary Fortunato Abat, who is also
chairman of the National Disaster Coordinating Council,
Agriculture Secretary Salvador Escudero and Environment and
Natural Secretary Victor Ramos to study and submit to him a
program of about 200 million to 250 million pesos (6 to 7.6
million U.S. dollars) to address El Nino, a weather phenomenon
caused by warming Pacific waters.
</P>
<P>
El Nino can bring heavy rainfalls and flooding as well as
droughts.
</P>
<P>
Because few typhoons hit the country in the year, "so we are
addressing very, very firmly this El Nino phenomenon," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the government has already released big amounts of
funds, amounting to 1.5 billion pesos (45 million dollars) so far,
to adopt measures against El Nino.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said top priority should be given to local community
projects for irrigation, water conservation, water recycling and
water utilization such as small farm reservoirs, small water
impounding projects and shallow well tubes for irrigation.
</P>
<P>
Ramos asked the three officials to submit to him the results of
 actions they have taken no later than November 17.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Encourages Blacks to Invest in Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Council for
Tourism (ZCT) today said it will support indigenous investment in
the sector to enable more locals to join the lucrative industry.
</P>
<P>
Incoming Chairman Herbert Nkala said time is ripe for black
Zimbabweans to become service providers rather than general
employees in the sector.
</P>
<P>
"This is a big industry which has regrettably seen blacks
being involved as ordinary workers rather than being owners of
the means of production," Nkala said, adding that "the trend
should not continue."
</P>
<P>
ZCT, said the chairman, would meet the many challenges in
tourism to ensure growth in the sector which has become a major
employer with more than 100,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
"Tourism remains a major employer and foreign exchange
earner," he said. "Last year it earned 2.4 billion Zimbabwe
Dollars (about 218 million U.S. Dollars) in foreign currency, and
now accounts for five percent of the gross domestic product."
</P>
<P>
Nkala said there is need to improve infrastructure in the
resort areas and "to remove all barriers" that inhibited the free
flow of tourists into the country.

The decision by Egypt, one of Washington's closest Arab allies,

<HEADLINE> Doctors in Shanghai Use Acupuncture for Anaesthesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Researchers at the Shanghai
Medical University are using new anaesthesia by acupuncture in
combination with western medicine to improve the success rate of
their operations.
</P>
<P>
It has even proven successful in brain surgery, where the risk
of being handicapped or of dying is great. But, by using the new
anaesthesia, the success rate of such operations can be as high as
98 percent.
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that acupuncture can stimulate the body's
self-adjustment system to relieve pain, but often fails to provide
an overall anaesthesic effect for the part of the body being
operated on.
</P>
<P>
After several years of study, they found that using acupuncture
along with small doses of western anaesthetics can help relieve
pain both during and after the operation, and can reduce the
side-effects or risk of using large doses of drugs.
</P>
<P>
It can also help patients remain awake to co-operate with
doctors during the operation instead of being rendered unconscious
by large doses of anaesthetics. In some operations, like throat
reconstruction, co-operation by the patient is vital to the
success of the operation.
</P>
<P>
With the use of acupuncture, patients usually recover more
rapidly and have a reduced risk of complications after the
operation, the researchers say.

ABU DHABI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Oman will attend the fourth
Middle East and North Africa Economic Conference to be held in
the Qatari capital Doha on Sunday, the Omani Foreign Ministry

In a statement issued today, the Omani foreign ministry said
Muscat will send an undersecretary of the Ministry of Industry

</P>
<P>
The ministry said that Oman made the decision in view of the
fact that the meeting will take place in "an Arab brother state's

Oman is the fourth Arab country who decided to take part in
the U.S.-backed conference. Yemen, Jordan and Kuwait have
announced their participation in the gathering which has been
downgraded from a summit to the ministerial level.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which was traditionally attended by Arab
states, Israel and their major partners in the other parts of the

</P>
<P>
Egypt, Syrian, the Palestinian Authority, Lebanon, the UAE,
Morocco and Saudi Arabia have announced their boycott to the

<P>
BUCHAREST, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Hungarian privatization
process is nearing its end, with German and U.S. investors on the
top of the buyers' list.
</P>
<P>
The privatization, which started at the beginning of 1990, is
scheduled to conclude before the general elections to be held in
next May.
</P>
<P>
The total number of state-owned enterprises in Hungary has

SHANGHAI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at the Shanghai
Tumor Research Institute have discovered a gene defect in the
No.17 chromosome of liver cancer patients, a major step forward in
the basic research on liver cancer.
</P>
<P>
The scientists claimed that their discovery is the first of the
kind in the world. They also said they found the same problem in
patients from other places in addition to those in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
They believe this indicates that there may be some unknown
cancer gene connected with liver cancer or cancer-fighting gene
groups in the No.17 chromosome.
</P>
<P>
The State Science and Technology Commission has listed the
research project as one the major state medical science projects
and signed an agreement with the Genecore Bio-Technologies Inc. of

<HEADLINE> Swedish Company targets Upset Stomachs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, November 12 (Xinhua)-- Astra, a Swedish
pharmaceuticals group, is expected to expand the sale of its
best-selling ulcer medicine Losec by 25 percent, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the expansion is recent approval that will
permit the drug to be used in the treatment of dyspeptic
complaints, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Dyspepsia is a term used to describe various types of
indigestion, such as heartburn or stomachache, which do not
involve ulcers. The total market potential for this area, which
Astra has until now not fully exploited, is substantially larger
than that of stomach ulcers.
</P>
<P>
Astra has obtained the approval of British health authorities
for the use of Losec to treat non-diagnosed stomach pains. Similar
approvals in a number of other European countries are in the
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Astra currently has about 5 percent of the dyspepsia
market. "If we can increase this from 5 to 10 percent, it will
have a major effect on Losec sales," said the company's
spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Provide Assistance to Laos, Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos said
today that the Philippines is preparing a package of development
assistance and technical support to assist Laos and Myanmar in
tapping the potentials of their respective peoples.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his regular press conference at the Presidential
Palace, Ramos said the package, in fulfillment of his commitment
made during a visit to Laos and Myanmar on October 15-18, will be
unveiled shortly.
</P>
<P>
He said the Philippines, which holds the current chairmanship
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), has a
responsibility to help in the development of the two new ASEAN
members, which joined the regional grouping in July.
</P>
<P>
The other members of ASEAN are Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
According to Ramos, the Philippines will help promote Laos'
managerial skills through the establishment of scholarships in
Philippine management schools and the cooperation between
Philippine universities and the National University of Laos.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines would also provide English training programs
for Laos, help enhance Laos' women empowerment, and help Laos
develop agriculture and rebuild the country's banking system, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the human resource development package for Myanmar
covers training on development planning and project evaluation,
upgrading courses for technology instructors, skills supervising
training, master programs in management and graduate programs in
development economics.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said a journalist training program has been added to the
assistance package for Myanmar at the request of the editor of
Myanmar's sole English-language newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: No More Use of Canadian Passports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu promised here today that Israeli agents will
never use Canadian passports any more in their overseas operations.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made this promise while meeting with Canadian
Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy who arrived here Tuesday on a
two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The falling out between Ottawa and Jerusalem, over Israel's
Mossad's use of Canadian passports in the abortive bid to
assassinate Hamas political leader Khaled Mashaal in Amman on
September 25, did come up as expected during today's meeting
between Netanyahu and Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said after the meeting that he reassured Axworthy
that Israeli agents will never use Canadian passports again in
future in overseas operations because Canada regards it as a
serious matter that can harm bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Canada, angered by Mossad hit men's using forged Canadian
passports in the Amman operation, recalled its ambassador from
Israel in early October. The ambassador has since returned to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Axworthy asked Israel to participate in the
anti-land mine conference due to be held in Ottawa next month.
Netanyahu told Axworthy that Israel will send a delegation,
including mine experts, to the upcoming conference.
</P>
<P>
Israel is among the countries which are unwilling to sign a
treaty banning the use of mines.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Axworthy met with his Israeli counterpart David
Levy.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a joint forum Tuesday sponsored by the Peres Center
for Peace and the Palestinian Center for Regional Studies,
Axworthy said Canada will continue providing material and
diplomatic support to the parties negotiating peace.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Middle East states to attend the fourth Middle
East and North Africa Economic Conference, to be held in Qatari
capital Doha on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Many Arab countries, including Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates have announced their boycott of
the conference which also includes Israel.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
the private sector are working closely to solve the current
currency crisis by lowering the costs of doing business and
improving the infrastructure needed for growth.
</P>
<P>
Trade Secretary Cesar Bautista said today that the move is
aimed at sustaining investors' confidence in the strength of the
Philippine economy.
</P>
<P>
This strategy is part of the 11-point action agenda, which was
drawn during the recent multi-sectoral conference to address the
present currency crisis having plagued the country since July.
</P>
<P>
Bautista said the government and the private sector are also
trying to reduce costs that could eventually be passed on to
buyers.
</P>
<P>
He said the National Power Corporation and power distributors
are discussing lowering of power rates during non-peak hours.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Export Industry Development Council and the
Philippine Ports Authority have decided to review ways of cutting
costs on port handling services on November 30.
</P>
<P>
The government also began to rationalize tariffs to boost the
international competitiveness of the country's economy, Bautista
said.
</P>
<P>
The Trade and Related Matters Committee will start to review
tariffs on 22 priority sectors next month. These sectors are those
with latent competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Bautista said his department and the Central Bank will also
intensify the monitoring of trade transaction data to better
project pending opportunities and threats.
</P>
<P>
Imports will undergo closer review by virtue of a proposed
presidential directive to ensure efficiency and relevance in order
to reduce trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has been hounded by a currency crisis since
July, which swept Southeast Asian nations and sent shock waves to
other regions. The Philippine peso has so far depreciated by
nearly 27 percent against the U.S. dollar.

NANJING, November 12 (Xinhua) - The east China coastal province
of Jiangsu has been successful in its port improvements and
handled 20 million tons of foreign trade in the first nine months.
</P>
<P>
The volume this year is expected to reach 28 million tons,
seven times the figure of a decade ago, when the province's ports
began to open to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
In the first three quarters of this year, Jiangsu had a
container volume of over 400,000 TEUs, and 550,000 TEUs are
estimated for the whole year, a 38 percent rise over last year.
</P>
<P>
The increasing port capacity is playing a major role in the
province's foreign trade. Seven of its port cities have 90 percent
of the overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu has 11 Grade-1 airports, sea ports, and river ports
with overseas-oriented service. It has 110 foreign trade berths
each capable of handling 10,000-ton vessels.
</P>
<P>
Containers can be shipped from Lianyungang, Nanjing, Zhenjian,
Jiangyin, Yangzhou and Zhangjiagang to Hong Kong, Japan, the
Republic of Korea, and Europe, or can be sent by train across the

</P>
<P>
During their meeting in the Great Hall of the People, Wang said

constitutes a major part of bilateral relations. He said the
Chinese government puts great importance on expanding the friendly

<P>
DALIAN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- China beat Kuwait 1-0 in their
last soccer World Cup Asian Zone qualifying match here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chinese midfielder Ma Mingyu scored the winning goal in the
32nd minute, when he delivered a surprise 20-yard blast from
center to beat Kuwait's goalkeeper Al J. Ahmad.
</P>

Referee Angeles Arturo of the United States flashed five yellow
cards, booking China's Fan Zhiyi and Sun Jihai.

Kuwait's Al S. Nohayr, Al S. Hani and Al S. Naser were also
booked.

Chinese coach Qi Wusheng said: "Our players played
conscientiously and to their best. However, we still appeared
infrior to the Kuwait players as far as passing and tactical
awareness are concerned.
</P>
<P>
"We won the match just because of the long blast from the
midfielder Ma Mingyu." added Qi, who has guided the Chinese
national team for five years.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether he would resign after the failure to
qualify, he said, "I did not finish my work in a satisfactory
manner in this period of time. Whether to stay in the job or quit
is the question I would have to decide soon."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's coach Milan Macla said: "In the first half we had good
opportunities and the goalkeeper helped us a lot. But from these
opportunities we did not score."
</P>
<P>
China finished fourth in the group with 11 points and Kuwait
bottom at 8.
</P>
<P>
Iran, who have had played all its group matches, collected 12
points, followed by Saudi Arabia at 11 and Qatar at 10 with one
game remaining.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia will meet Qatar in the remaining match later on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>

group winner and Saudi Arabia be the runner-up. If either side
win, the victor will qualify for France and Iran will be placed
second.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos said today that he will bring up specific proposals for a
financing mechanism to solve the currency woes besetting Southeast
Asia at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings in
Vancouver this month.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said he was getting "a very good response" from his
fellow leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) and Japan to his soundings for a cooperative approach to
the currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that specifics on the proposed mechanism would be
worked out during the meeting of ASEAN vice financial ministers
and deputy governors of central banks to be held in Manila on
November 17 and 18.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said ASEAN trade ministers have also responded to the
calls for the establishment of the mechanism, adding that he is
also getting inputs from the private sector and top business
leaders in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Ramos said that he will seek APEC's endorsement for
the financial mechanism that would augment the resources provided
by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the region.
</P>
<P>
"This would assure economies of the availability of financing
as they pursue needed reforms and adjustment measures in
conjunction with the IMF," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said he would also seek the APEC leaders'
cooperation in promoting sound practices to reinforce
macro-economic fundamentals, supervising the banking system,
developing the capital market and improving transparency in the
region.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Taiwan Democratic
Self-Government League, composed mainly of Taiwan compatriots
residing on the Chinese mainland, has contributed a great deal to
the peaceful reunification of the motherland by implementing the
guidelines and policies of the Communist Party of China toward
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Kehui, executive president of the Sixth National Congress
of the league, made the remarks at today's opening of the
congress in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He said it is important for the league to strengthen exchanges
between compatriots on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, to
fight against separation of Taiwan from the motherland and "Taiwan
independence" as well as foreign interference into China's
internal affairs, to maintain the basic interests and legitimate
rights of the Taiwan compatriots, and to promote the reunification
of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government
League has gone all out to boost cross-strait relations, Zhang
said.
</P>
<P>
For instance, he said, his league studied the changes of the
situation of Taiwan in 1992, and made suggestions to related
departments.
</P>
<P>
After President Jiang Zemin made his eight-point propositions
on the Taiwan issue in 1995, his league and the All-China
Federation of Taiwan Compatriots held meetings urging the Taiwan
authorities to respond quickly, he added.
</P>
<P>
To push forward the cross-strait relations, Zhang said, his
league also invited and received Taiwan compatriots from Taiwan
Island and overseas, and assisted some related departments to
smooth difficulties of Taiwan's investors on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the league has received some 10,000
Taiwan compatriots and assisted in introducing investments from
Taiwan worth 2.9 billion yuan.

BAGHDAD, November 12 (Xinhua) -- For the ninth time in 10 days,
Iraq blocked Americans from entering a weapons inspection site
Wednesday in defiance of pressure for it to back down.
</P>
<P>
Five weapons inspection teams left the U.N. headquarters in
Baghdad at 9:30 a.m. today and headed for the sites they desired
to inspect in and near the capital.
</P>
<P>
As one of the teams arrived at a Baghdad site, the Iraqis in
charge refused to let it in because there were American members in
the mission. The inspectors turned back to their headquarters and
the other four teams then followed suit, according to the official
news agency.
</P>
<P>
Iraq decided on October 29 not to allow American members of the
U.N. arms inspection teams to participate in the U.N. mission,
accusing them of working for Washington, not for the U.N..
</P>
<P>
In a few hours today, the U.N. Security Council is to vote on a
U.S. and British resolution which would pressurize Iraq into
complying with the council resolutions and condemn its tampering
with weapons inspections.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Again Bars Americans Inspectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 12 (Xinhua) -- For the ninth time in 10 days,
Iraq blocked Americans from entering a weapons inspection site
Wednesday in defiance of pressure for it to back down.
</P>
<P>
Five weapons inspection teams left the U.N. headquarters in
Baghdad at 9:30 a.m. today and headed for the sites they desired
to inspect in and near the capital.
</P>
<P>
As one of the teams arrived at a Baghdad site, the Iraqis in
charge refused to let it in because there were American members in
the mission. The inspectors turned back to their headquarters and
the other four teams then followed suit, according to the official
news agency.
</P>
<P>
Iraq decided on October 29 not to allow American members of the
U.N. arms inspection teams to participate in the U.N. mission,
accusing them of working for Washington, not for the U.N..

<P>
FUZHOU, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The State Planning Commission
has approved the feasibility study for the use of foreign funds
for building a 600,000-kw hydropower plant in east China's Fujian
Province.
</P>
<P>
The hydropower station, which will be built on the Tingjiang
River in Fengshi Township, Yongding County, will require total
investments of 5.16 billion yuan (621.69 million U.S. dollars),
including loans of 160 million U.S. dollars from the Asian
Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for the river to be dammed in September next
year, with the first unit of generators scheduled to go online in
July 2001. The hydropower plant will have an annual generating
capacity of 1.51 billion kw/hr.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary construction for the station is proceeding on
smoothly, with a 346-m water diversion tunnel scheduled for
completion by the end of this year.

<P>
CANBERRA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
lower against its United States counterpart today despite
receiving support from good exporter buying.
</P>
<P>
The local unit settled at 69.85 US cents, down from 69.94 in
Sydney previously but higher than the session's open of 69.78
cents.
</P>
<P>
John Radinoff, a foreign exchange executive, said the local
currency had "held up pretty well" because of exporter interest
despite falls on regional stock markets.
</P>
<P>
However, Radinoff said pressure remained to the downside for
the Australian dollar in the near term in the light of global

KAMPALA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Uganda exported 130,829 bags
of coffee (60 kilograms per bag) in October in comparistion with
220,072 bags in September, The New Vision reported today.
</P>
<P>
The FOB (free on board) value free of insurance and
transportation charges was 12.14 million U.S. dollars in
October, as against 18.54 million dollars in September, it added.
</P>
<P>
Citing the figure from Uganda Coffee Development, the report
said that coffee exports declined by 61.6 percent, over 340,000
bags in last October. The value of coffee export for October
last year was 26.81 million of U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The projected volume of coffee export for October this year
was 320,000 bags with the value of 26.8 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The decreasing of the volume and the value in October this
year were attributed to long dry season from July to September.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is the most important export in Uganda, which accounts
for 65 percent of the country's total export value.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
gleaned satisfying results in exploring for polymetallic nodule
resources in the eastern waters of the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
Scientists aboard an ocean expedition vessel collected nearly
3.5 tons of polymetallic nodule resources and 467 kilograms of
cobalt-rich nodule minerals during their half-year trip, according
to Zhang Guozhen, one of the chief scientists on the expedition.
</P>
<P>
The vessel, named Marine Four, left Guangzhou on May 20 and
returned today.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, China was registered with the United Nations as a
pioneering investor in international sea-bed exploration,
acquiring the rights to explore a polymetallic nodule area
covering 150,000 square kilometers in the eastern waters of the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
This was the seventh trip for the Marine Four to the area for
scientific surveys.
</P>
<P>
During the latest expedition, scientists also conducted
seismological surveys along a total length of 1,034 km, magnetic
surveys along 3,444 km, and sea-bed topographical surveys in an
area covering 30,000 sq. km., Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
With previous and future investigations, an area covering
75,000 sq. km. will be used for China's commercial exploration in
the next century.

NEW DELHI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- With its strong basis in
agriculture, India can successfully tap the 10 billion U.S. dollar
global perfumery intermediates market, a study shows.
</P>
<P>
A large number of extraction units have been set up in the
country in the small and medium sector for producing concrete and
essential oils which are intermediates used in the perfumery
industry, said the study conducted by the Industrial and Technical
Consultancy Organization of Tamil Nadu Ltd. (ITCOT), which is
available here today.
</P>
<P>
Perfumery intermediates are used in manufacturing soaps,
detergents, disinfectants, room sprays, paints and cosmetic
powders.
</P>
<P>
Based on the study, the ITCOT has presented a report entitled
"Opportunities in Perfumery Industries", listing the opportunities
and prospects for this industry in the global scenario.
</P>
<P>
The report proposed a number of non-synthetic, non-pollution
and eco-friendly projects to produce quality perfumery
intermediates.
</P>
<P>
The ITCOT also suggested that Indian entrepreneurs target
products like menthol, basil, jasmine, lemon grass and eucalyptus
for producing essential oils and concrete.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Install Anti-Missile Systems on Aircraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Air Force
(SLAF) is considering to equip all its aircraft with automatic
anti-missile systems after one of its Mi-24 chopper was brought
down by a rebel missile Monday, military sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Two pilots were killed after a missile fired by the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) hit the Mi-24 chopper over Vavuniya
in the northeastern coastal area.
</P>
<P>
The sources quoted high-ranking officers of the Air Force as
saying that they are looking into the possibility of equipping all
the air force craft with anti-missile systems, which cost 700,000
U.S. dollars each.
</P>
<P>
The sources didn't mention how many aircraft have not been
equipped with such systems.
</P>
<P>
An officer at the Air Force headquarters in Colombo said that
so far half of the air force aircraft are not equipped with
automatic anti-missile systems.
</P>
<P>
The officer, who asked not to be identified, said the Air Force
is in the process of installing the systems to its fleet.
</P>
<P>
Military intelligence reports said the LTTE had obtained many
missiles recently, posing a great threat to the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force today said initial investigations have found that
in Monday's attack, the LTTE rebels had fired a total of five
missiles at the fleet of four military choppers en route from
Vavuniya to Elephant Pass in the north.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated Mi-24 crashed into the Kokkilai Lagoon in the
northeastern coastal area after it was hit by one missile. The
other three Mi-17s evaded the rest missiles due to the activation
of automatic anti-missile systems.
</P>
<P>
About 100 soldiers were on board the three choppers at the time
of attack.
</P>
<P>
Air Force Commander Air Marshal Oliver Ranasinghe has said that
missile attacks by the rebels would not deter further air force
engagement in the on-going ethnic war.
</P>
<P>
The war has been going on for 14 years between the government
troops and the LTTE, which is fighting for an independent state of
their own in the north and east of the country.

In addition, the effect of this year's El Nino was just at its
beginning stage, he said, adding that it will last until next

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Solve Traffic Problem in Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
start a 22 million U.S. dollars rehabilitation of the ageing
traffic signal system in Manila to ease traffic chaos in the city.
</P>
<P>
Upgrading the antiquated traffic signal system is a vital part
of the government's plan to solve the protracted traffic problem,
Godofredo Galano, director of the Traffic Engineering Center under
the Department of Public Works and Highways, told reporters today.
</P>
<P>
The ageing traffic signal system has been blamed as one of the
causes for traffic chaos in the capital city, one of the worst in
Asia's mega-cities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Galano said motorists and commuters who are not satisfied with
the traffic signal system tend to disregard traffic rules,
resulting into chaos.
</P>
<P>
"When everybody is satisfied with the (traffic signal) system,
then everybody will follow the traffic rule and regulations, there
will be an orderly traffic flow," he explained.
</P>
<P>
The fixed time traffic signal system, which was installed in
1977, has become so ineffective that it could not cope with the
demand of the growing volume of both the vehicles and the
population in the metropolis.
</P>
<P>
Under the fixed-time system, all of Metro Manila's 450 traffic
lights are synchronized and that changing of traffic lights take
at least 15 minutes regardless of the volume of the traffic.
</P>
<P>
Galanao expected the traffic flow will improve after the
problem of the intersection has been solved.
</P>
<P>
With 35 percent of the total rehabilitation cost granted by
Australia, Metro Manila will adopt the intelligent traffic system
called the Sydney Adoptive Traffic Signal System, a new system
which can automatically respond by needs.

<HEADLINE> Parties in Nigeria Urged to Draft Abacha as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Minister of Special
Duties Wada Nas has called on the country's five political
parties to draft the head of the military government, General
Sani Abacha as their common candidate in next year's presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports, the minister said in a statement
Tuesday in Abuja that such a move is allowed by the draft
constitution of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 draft constitution was forwarded to the Abacha
government on June 27 of that year after exactly a year's work by
the constitution conference. But until now it has not been
published, despite repeated calls by some politicians.
</P>
<P>
The minister explained that such a move is necessary
because "no credible candidates have shown interest to contest",
despite Abacha's call on Nigerians to feel absolutely free to
express their ambitions within the five registered parties.
</P>
<P>
Wada Nas said that even if Abacha succeed himself in
October 1998, there will be no presidency of the present statue,
because his current power as the head of state will be shared by
the president and the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He, therefore, argued that Abacha's stay in power beyond 1998
should not be regarded as the continuation of the domination of
power by the north.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the arising call on Abacha to contest, the
minister said people has the right to oppose the call, but it
will be wrong for such people to vilify those who are in support
of Abacha.
</P>
<P>
As the military government's transition to civil rule program
draws nearer, Abacha's intention has become a concern to
more and more people.
</P>
<P>
Abacha has said that it is not new for military heads
of state to shed their uniform and become civilian presidents,
and that his candidacy is to be decided by the Nigerian people.

PARIS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Algeria Tuesday expressed regret that the French government
"backed" the demonstration in support of Algerian people held on
Monday in Paris and several other French cities, saying that this
was in contradiction with repeated promise by France not to
interfere into the internal affairs of Algeria.
</P>
<P>
-- French President Jacques Chirac today began a state visit to
Vietnam, during which he will insist on the need to reinforce an
economic space for French-speaking countries and to "resist" the
universalizaton of the American culture. Several economic
contracts will be signed during the visit, including one on
installing 500,000 telephone lines in Ho Chi-Minh City by the
France Telecom company.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Iraq refused to yield on Tuesday as the United States
pressed the U.N. Security Council to impose new sanctions against
Baghdad for its decision to exclude Americans from the operations
on disarmament of the United Nations. American officers on board
the Nimitz aircraft carrier which is cruising the Persian Gulf
have warned that if Iraq shoots down the U.S. U2 spy plane, "the
risk of confrontation will be very high" and "chances of
retaliation will be very probable."
</P>
<P>
-- According to a survey by le Figaro on the eve of the
Francophone summit to be held in Hanoi, the French language is on
the decline in Africa but on the rise in Canada. In Algeria, the
French language remains a major channel of communication despite a
law voted in 1992 making the Arabic the official language. In
Canada, the federal government uses French language as a weapon to
resist culture invasion from its gigantic neighbor.

<HEADLINE> Israel Defense Minister to Visit Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai will visit Ankara next month in a bid to
strengthen military ties with Turkey, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai's visit comes at the invitation of his Turkish

Mordechai will focus on military cooperation during talks with
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz
and other Turkish leaders.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The maneuvers have been planned for next January and are to be
held off the Israeli coast.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Israel has reportedly begun delivery of air-to-ground,
stand-off precision-guided Popeye missiles to Turkey. At least 40

Galil assault rifles.
</P>
<P>
Israel Aircraft Industries is upgrading 54 Turkish F-4s in a
632-million-U.S.-dollar deal.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Get Free of IMF Supervision: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is set to exit
from the decades-long supervision of its economic development by
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) by December this year with
the enactment of a new oil deregulation law.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council chaired
by President Fidel Ramos has reached a consensus that the
Philippines should exit by December, Finance Secretary Roberto de
Ocampo was quoted today by local TV as saying.
</P>
<P>
De Ocampo urged the Congress to come up with a new oil
deregulation law in time for a decent graduation of the country
from the 23rd or last IMF supervision program.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson earlier warned that the
country's exit from the program may be delayed again because of
the recent ruling of the Supreme Court nullifying the
nine-month-old oil deregulation law.
</P>
<P>
But de Ocampo, who is also vice chairman of the Philippine
negotiating panel with the IMF, said he does not see the need for
an extension of the program.
</P>
<P>
Congress leaders have pledged to rush a revised oil
deregulation bill expected to level the playing field between
existing oil companies and new entrants.
</P>
<P>
On October 30, the High Tribunal overwhelmingly ruled to
abolish the oil law on the ground that it is unconstitutional by
allowing the country's three dominant oil companies to gain
monopoly of the industry.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, the government will no longer regulate oil
prices and pay subsidy to the oil industry, and the three major
oil firms can adjust oil prices freely. The deregulation of the
oil industry is part of the IMF program.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines, which has been under the IMF guidance for 35
years, was supposed to be free from the IMF this June after
meeting all the criteria set in the last program.
</P>
<P>
But the country's graduation was delayed due to the failure of
the Congress to pass the final component of the Comprehensive Tax
Reform Package (CTRP), which is designed to boost the government's
tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
The tax reform bill is now being deliberated by the Bicameral
Conference Committee and is expected to pass before the Congress
goes on its annual Christmas vacation on November 27.
</P>
<P>
The country had already passed most of the performance criteria
of the IMF, including the base money level, net international
gross reserves and external borrowings, in the third quarter.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Free Itself From Monetary Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will free itself
from the current monetary crisis and will be stronger than before
the crisis, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) Michel Camdessus said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here after meeting with
President Soeharto, the IMF chief said the rupiah (Indonesian
national currency), which has been hit badly in the monetary
crisis since July this year, will recover. "Of course, the
economic growth will slow down in the years to come," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, Indonesia needs to be transparent and
responsible in managing its state budget to enable it to gain
confidence and credibility.
</P>
<P>
"How can we build confidence and credibility without
transparency and responsibility?" Camdessus said.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus, who arrived here Tuesday afternoon for a two-day
visit, said "it is impossible to build a nation in just one week
and Indonesia is still in this process."
</P>
<P>
He expressed his confidence that the outcome of a transparent
and responsible management could be seen in three years.
</P>
<P>
According to Camdessus, economic management during a monetary
crisis should have three factors: the first is a stable and
reliable monetary policy; the second is a restructurization policy
in the financial and banking sectors; and the third is a policy
that aims to reduce monopolistic practices, increase the number of
state companies floating their shares in the stock market to
increase their efficiency; and attract more investors.
</P>
<P>
He held that some of these policies have already been
implemented by Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The monetary crisis in the Southeast Asian region has caused
the rupiah to lose about 40 percent against the US dollar.
</P>
<P>
He said every crisis is a mixture of opportunities and dangers.
</P>
<P>
The IMF chief predicted that Indonesia's economic growth will
be stable after 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The country's economic growth in 1997 and 1998 will slow due
to the crisis. But its growth will surpass these years in 1999 and
2000," he added.
</P>
<P>
The IMF announced an aid package for Indonesia last month of
about 23 billion US dollars to help the country implement its
reform program.

<HEADLINE> Johannesburg's Residents Urged to Save Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Johannesburg
municipal authorities have urged people living in the
Johannesburg region to use water sparingly during hot spells
after two reservoirs run empty last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Despite the cooler weather being experienced, the appeal
remained valid as the empty reservoirs needed to fill up again,
local daily the Citizen today quoted a municipal spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Many northern and eastern suburbs were left without water for
up to 48 hours after two reservoirs ran empty last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Graham Pearson, Chief Engineer of Water Operation in
Johannesburg, said the heat wave caused the highest water
consumption for a Sunday in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
In mid-October, South Africa's Department of Water Affairs
said South Africa, which was predicted to be struck by the El
Nino weather phenomenon in 1997-98, should not dry up
water reserves in the country.
</P>
<P>
El Nino, is expected to cause a warming the Pacific Ocean, and
will exert a generally negative impact on South Africa's summer
rainfall. It plunged the country into its worst drought in
1992-93, costing the economy more than two billion U.S. dollars.

GUANGZHOU, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou city, capital of
south Guangdong province which pioneered China's opening up
drive, is poised to become a financial center in the Pearl River
Delta.
</P>
<P>
Under an ambitious program drawn up by the city government,
Guangzhou will build itself into a regional financial center in
the Pearl River Delta by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The delta, adjacent to Hong Kong and Macao, is one of China's
economic powerhouses.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, Guangzhou expects to play a bigger
role as a regional financial center in fund-raising, foreign
exchange trading, insurance, financial information,
accounts-clearing and training of financial personnel.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou ranks third after Shanghai and Beijing in terms of
overall economic strength, which consolidated the city's efforts
towards a regional financial center.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of this year, Guangzhou registered a
GDP of 114.2 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The city had had 2,300 financial institutions by the end of
last year and dozens of foreign banks or their representative
offices.

TAIYUAN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Li Fensheng, 46, has spent
five years traveling throughout China to tell people one simple,
but easily neglected fact: There is only one life for a person;
protect your health.
</P>
<P>
Li, who works at Linfen City Procuratorate in north China's
Shanxi Province, said he felt sorry when he saw many people his
age suffering serious diseases or dying because of overwork.
</P>
<P>
That regret caused him to initiate a "health-defending
publicity activity" around the country to arouse people to pay
attention to their own health.
</P>
<P>
Li first gained the support of his wife, a teacher. His wife
spent numerous sleepless nights writing publicity materials.
</P>
<P>
He also visited experts and read medical journals to obtain
health-care knowledge.
</P>
<P>
During a five-year period, he sent out in excess of 4,000
letters, 70 publicity releases and 800 medical books. To do this,
Li spent 25,000 yuan (about 3,120 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Li has traveled through 12 provinces and cities in the
country. Moved by his deeds, dozens of couples have joined his
effort to voluntarily publicize health-care knowledge.

<HEADLINE> Manila, Muslim Rebels Start Eighth Round Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) today started their
eighth round low-level peace talks in a southern Philippine city,
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was being held at a university in Marawi City,
capital of Lanao del Sur province in central Mindanao, Ghadzali
Jaafar, MILF vice chairman for political affairs, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The government peace panel was led by newly-installed chief
negotiator Orlando Soriano and Maj. Gen. Joselin Nazareno,
commander of the Army's Fourth Infantry Division based in central
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
And the rebel negotiating team was headed by Uztads Abduladiz
Mimbantas, MILF vice chairman for internal affairs, who replaced
Jaafar as the chief rebel negotiator.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, the two sides are expected to sign
the ground rules for implementing a comprehensive ceasefire
agreement in entire Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
They will also discuss the public executions of alleged
criminals by the MILF last month and a recent attack on a military
camp in Maguindanao province.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said both sides expressed optimism that an
agreement on truce ground rules and principles would be signed at
the end of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and the government began their exploratory peace talks
in January this year and made a breakthrough in July by signing
the preliminary general truce accord.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides have failed to agree on ground rules for
carrying out the agreement due to the public execution of several
alleged criminals by the MILF last month.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway faction of the larger Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF), has fought the government for more than
two decades for a separate Islamic state in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is currently the largest anti-government force with an
estimated 12,000 fighters. The MNLF signed a peace accord with
Manila last year.

largest special economic zone, has achieved marked results in
protecting wild animals and plants.
</P>
<P>
The afforestation area of mangroves in Hainan, south China, now
stands at 30,000 mu (1,800 hectares), with 18 varieties, or 58
percent of the country's total kinds of mangroves.
</P>
<P>
Population figures are also increasing markedly for some wild
animals, including black-crowned gibbons.
</P>
<P>
Hainan, the only tropical region in China, boasts rich wild
animal and plant resources. The province has over 4,600 varieties
of vascular bundle plants, with 630 plants indigenous to
Hainan. There are 561 terrestrial vertebrates, with 35 indigenous
species.
</P>
<P>
A recent study shows that in the province's Wuzhi Mountain
Nature Reserve live 107 rare animals, such as clouded leopards,
sambar, jungle fowl, silver pheasants and black-crowned gibbons.
</P>
<P>
Years ago, the number of many rare animals and plants dropped
drastically due to over-killing and poaching. The situation was
put to an end with the establishment of increasing number of
nature reserves in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the province has 73 natural and ecological
protection zones, with an area of 159,800 hectares, or 4.7 percent
of the province's land area.

<HEADLINE> Earliest Purple Pigment Discovered in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The earliest purple pigment ever
used by human beings has been discovered by a group of Chinese and
German archaeologists researching the famed terracotta warriors of
the Qing Dynasty (221-207 B.C.) in Xi'an, capital of northwest
China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
From the samples of the coloring used on the clothes of the
ancient terracotta warriors, archaeologists found copper barium
silicate, a kind of purple dye used by Chinese 2,100 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the material has never been found before in ancient
western paintings, but it's still not clear whether the dye is
natural or synthetic.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, two experts from the United States discovered a
similar type of synthetic dye used to paint some cultural relics
of the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-220 A.D.).

<HEADLINE> Jordan Against Military Action, Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister Fayez
Tarawneh said here today that Jordan is against any military
action as well as new sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh made the remark late Tuesday night at a joint press
conference with visiting Foreign Minister of Luxembourg Jacques
Poos, whose country holds the rotating presidency of the European
Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Poos arrived here Tuesday from Cairo, Egypt. He is on a
four-day regional tour at the head of an EU delegation, which will
also take him to Israel, the Palestinian self-rule territories and
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh said there should not be any military action against
Iraq, because it would ravage the living of the ordinary people
rather than bend the policy of the regime.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is also opposed to imposing new sanctions on Iraq, for
the sanctions usually affect the people, not the regime, he
said. Poos expressed the same idea.
</P>
<P>
"As we can see, seven years of U.N. sanctions have little
effect on the Iraqi government, but rather destroyed the living of
the ordinary people," Tarawneh said, adding that the crisis
between Baghdad and Washington should be solved through diplomatic
means.
</P>
<P>
The crisis could be settled only after both sides put up
dialogue and Iraq complies with all the related U.N. Security
Council resolutions, Tarawneh added.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's King Hussein and Crown Prince Hassan have said that
the crisis should be ended in a way that can guarantee the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq as well as pave the
way for implementation of U.N. Security Council's resolutions and
the lifting of sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad faces a showdown with the U.S. and U.N. by questioning
Washington's domination of U.N. weapons inspection missions in
Iraq and requesting U.N. sanctions be lifted.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The work to rescue historical
relics along the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River has been
accelerated.
</P>
<P>
In the region which is to be affected by the Yangtze River
after the damming of the Three Gorges there are 1,282 ancient
relics sites, with 453 artifacts on ground and 829 underground.
</P>
<P>
According to the relics rescuing and protection plan, 4.5
billion yuan is needed to remove and excavate some key relics
sites including Zhang Fei Temple, Shibaozai Protection Dam, Baidi
Town and the Rock-carving site at Qutang Gorge.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, more than 300 archaeologists and workers have
conducted searches for relics in over 20 cities and counties from
Yichang city in Hubei Province to Chongqing municipality.
</P>
<P>
In September, professors and students from the Archaeological
Department of Jilin University arrived at Fengjie and Badong
counties of Chongqing to begin excavating the relics sites.
</P>
<P>
Soon after, professors and students from six other
universities, including Beijing University and Sichuan Union
University, joined in.
</P>
<P>
In Yunyang County, archaeologists from Sichuan Union University
have been working at the tomb sites of the ancient "Ba People" and
have also found building relics of the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-220).
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists from Beijing University drew up a six-year
plan to complete the relics excavation work in Zhongxian County.

<TEXT>
<P>
Numerous large-scale projects are going on in Hubei Province in
central China in an attempt to salvage a number of ruins of
historical relics in the Three Gorges project area.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists have proved that Hubei has 130 on ground and 63
underground ruins of historical relices in the to-be-submerged
region.
</P>
<P>
Currently more than 100 teachers and students from Wuhan
University, Jilin University, Shandong University, Xiamen
University and Nanjing University are working at the sites to
assist with the urgent recovery of the historic items.
</P>
<P>
Hubei provincial government had allocated more than 10 million
yuan (1.2 million dollars) in funding for the project by the end
of August.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists have basically excavated three large ruins and
unearthed quite a number of historical relics dating back to the
Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770 B.C. to 256 B.C.) in Zigui County.
</P>
<P>
In Xingshan County, 13 tombs and three caves from the Han
Dynasty (206 B.C. to 220 A.D.) have been unearthed, while in
Badong County, archaeologists are busily uncovering nine
underground ruins.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan University, a leading state university in Hubei, has
enrolled dozens of students for a two-year course of study on
archaeology which focuses specifically on the Three Gorges Project
areas, in a bid to provide more specially-trained personnel for
the province.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all of the experts at the Yichang Museum are working at
the various sites to collect information on the Shang Dynasty
(some 16 century B.C. to 11 Century B.C.).
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts believe that the Three Gorge Project areas may
become a cradle for fostering future archaeologists.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Information
Minister Mushahid Hussain today condemned the killing of four
Americans and a Pakistani in Karachi, saying that it is a
despicable act.
</P>
<P>
The minister also termed the incident as "most unfortunate and
a reprehensible act". He reiterated the government's resolve to
tackle the problem with an iron hand.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan said earlier the government is
looking into the shooting incident which occurred this morning in
the southern port city of Karachi.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Inspector General Malik Iqbal is heading the
investigation into the killings, Gohar said, adding President
Farooq Leghari and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif have been informed
of the tragic incident.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Interior Ministry or the Foreign Ministry,
he said, would be released in the afternoon after further details
are collected about the incident.
</P>
<P>
The four U.S. citizens, who were on a visit in connection with
official work at Union Texas Karachi, were gunned down by
unidentified assailants at around 8:20 a.m. on their way from
Karachi Sheraton Hotel to their office, located about three
kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
According to witnesses, the assailants were in a Red Honda
Civic, which was later found abandoned in a nearby area.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. embassy officials here when contacted declined
to make any comment on the incident, saying they were still
gathering details.
</P>
<P>
The incident came one day after a 12-member jury declared a
Pakistani national, Aimal Kansi, guilty of killing two CIA agents
and wounding three others in the January, 1993 shooting outside
the Central Intelligence Agency headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy on Tuesday warned all American citizens in
Pakistan to be on alert keeping in mind a possible retaliation

<HEADLINE> Beijing Primary, Middle School Students Sleep Less, Survey Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey shows that
nearly 50 percent of local primary school pupils and some 80
percent of middle school students sleep less than nine hours every
night.
</P>
<P>
Too much homework and bad habits are the main reasons behind
their shortened sleeping time, the survey concluded.
</P>
<P>
The survey, involving over 1,000 primary and middle students,
found that students between the fourth grade of primary school and
the third grade of junior middle school all listed "too much
homework" as the No. One factor affecting their sleep.
</P>
<P>
Some homework is given by teachers, some is required by
parents, surveyed students said.
</P>
<P>
Students who do not concentrate while doing their homework,
don't use their spare time constructively, and take up other
unproductive habits are the other most-commonly listed reasons for
shorter sleep time.
</P>
<P>
And too, the fact that some students have to get up early in
the morning to travel a far distance to school can lead to too
little sleep.
</P>
<P>
Concerned experts have called on schools to reduce the amount
of homework to guarantee nine hours of sleep a night for
students. Meanwhile, parents are also asked to help their children
form hood habits and create a favorable environment for their
healthy growth.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Import Maize for Food Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has signed a deal to
secure 100,000 tons of white maize from the United States to
replenish its strategic food reserve, Times of Zambia reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Chance Kabaghe, Chief Executive of Food
Reserve Agency (FRA), as saying Tuesday that under the deal,
which was signed on Monday, the first batch of 25,000 tons will
be shipped to Zambia in a week.
</P>
<P>
Kabaghe said that the consignment brings Zambia's total maize
imports to 170,000 tons as against the total deficit of 270,000
tons. Earlier last month, Zambia bought 70,000 tons of maize from
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The 100,000 tons of maize from the U.S., said Kabaghe, will
form part of the country's strategic food reserve in fighting
against an upcoming critical shortage of maize in December.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government has decided to appropriate about 37
million U.S dollars to import altogether 270,000 tons of white
maize to fill the demand gap caused by reduction of output in the
country during the 1996-1997 agricultural season.
</P>
<P>
This move is absolutely necessary in the country, where maize
is a staple for the people, in view of not only the production
shortfall but also the impending drought as a result of El Nino
phenomenon during the coming season.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's PPI Inflation Up in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's producer
price index (PPI) slightly went up to 6.1 percent in September
from August's 5.9 percent, figures released by the Central
Statistics Service (CSS) Tuesday showed.
</P>
<P>
The increase interrupted the downward trend since the PPI
peaked at 9.6 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
The PPI was pushed up mainly by higher prices for imported
crude oil and agricultural products at home, the CSS said.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe that the PPI rise in September does not
represent a change of the inflation picture. They predicted that
the PPI index will stabilize at 6-6.5 percent next year, compared
with 7.2 percent for this year.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen to Tighten Controls on Use of Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen, in south China's
Guangdong Province, plans to tighten controls on the use of land,
according to a local official in charge of city planning and land.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jiasheng, director of the City Planning and Land
Administration, said the city will increase proportion of land
available for tenders or auctions, and will introduce effective
measures to control leases.
</P>
<P>
He said the goal of strengthening controls is to improve
economic returns from land use in Shenzhen, China's first special
economic zone, and ensure the healthy development of the city's
real estate market.
</P>
<P>
Some 4.5 million sq. m. of land allotted to developers has
remained idle for an extended period of time, according to Liu.
</P>
<P>
The city has also recorded a high vacancy rate for housing
built for the open market, with total floor space standing at
2.73 million square meters.
</P>
<P>
Lax controls on the land supply and the lack of long-term
planning for real estate development are blamed for the negative
effects on the city's real estate market.

<HEADLINE> China to Continue to Develop Friendly Ties With Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
here today that the Chinese government will continue to pursue the
policy of developing friendly relations with Japan.
</P>
<P>
China, he said, is willing to make joint and unremitting
efforts with the Japanese government and the Japanese people in
seeking the goal of maintaining Sino-Japanese friendship from
generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is more important than ever for China and
Japan, both important nations in the region, to establish and
develop long-term and good neighborly ties oriented to the 21st
century when the world is moving rapidly toward multipolarization
and Asia's status is becoming more prominent.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks in meetings with leaders of three
Japanese political parties here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The three statesmen are Takako Doi, leader of the Social
Democratic Party, Ichiro Ozawa, leader of the New Frontier Party,
and Naoto Kan, representative of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Li told the party leaders that the purpose of his visit is to
work together with the Japanese side to help establish the
long-term good-neighborly ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting with Doi, Li said the Social Democratic Party
has maintained good relations with China over a long period of
time and has contributed to the growth of Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Social Democratic Party has remained "an
important and positive force" to support Sino-Japanese friendship
since the two countries normalized their relations 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Li also noted that the Social Democratic Party has always stuck
to "a clear-cut and correct position" on such important issues as
history and Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes the Social Democratic Party would play an even
greater role in promoting Sino-Japanese friendship.
</P>
<P>
Doi said it is most important for the Asian region to maintain
peace and trust among different countries, adding that Japan-China
friendly relations constitute an important part in this regard.
</P>
<P>
She said her party will continue to make effort in promoting
the exchanges and cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Doi also extended congratulations to the success of the 15th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Li said when meeting with Ozawa that the New Frontier Party has
established good relations of exchanges with the Chinese Communist
Party.
</P>
<P>
Many members of the New Frontier Party have been working hard
to promote Sino-Japanese friendship for a long time, Li said,
adding that these people have played a positive role in helping
enhance the friendship between the two peoples, particularly the
exchanges between the two countries' younger generations.
</P>
<P>
Ozawa said the New Frontier Party supports China's policies of
reform and opening up to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Li said he was happy to meet Kan and told him that China
attaches importance to the development of relations with the
Democratic Party of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side appreciates the positive attitude taken by the
Democratic Party in developing Japan-China relations ever since
its founding, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Kan said Japan once brought great sufferings to the Chinese
people although the two countries enjoy a long history of friendly
exchanges. He added that Japan should seriously examine itself in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
As a member of Asia, Kan said, Japan should maintain friendly
relations with its neighboring countries. He added that the
Democratic Party will strive for the development of Japan-China
friendly relations with an eye on the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, Li also exchanged views with the three
party leaders on major international issues and other issues of
common concern.
</P>
<P>
Chinese State Councillor and Minister in charge of the State
Science and Technology Commission Song Jian and other ranking
officials accompanying Li on the visit were present at the
meetings.

<HEADLINE> S.African Markets Urged to Open up to Zimbabwean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of Zimbabwe
Industries (CZI) once again appealed to neighbouring South Africa
to open up its market to Zimbabwean products and balance trade
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
CZI President Jonee Blanchfield said in a statement on Tuesday
that Zimbabwe is dismayed that in recent years the share of South
African exports to Zimbabwe had steadily risen, reaching a 38.3
percent increase in 1996, or 10.8 billion Zimbabwe Dollars (800
million U.S. dollars) worth of merchandise. Over the same period,
he said, South Africa imported a paltry two billion Zimbabwe
Dollars (160 million U.S. dollars) or just 9.6 percent of
Zimbabwe's total exports in that year.
</P>
<P>
"We call upon South African business people to urgently open
up and correct the trade imbalance. For the past five years the
economic relations between our two countries have not been as
they should be," she noted.
</P>
<P>
If South Africa continued stifling Zimbabwean exports, the
local market would soon dry up as there would be no income to
purchase their products anymore, the CZI president added.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations for a preferential trade pact have been going on
between Zimbabwe and South Africa since the 1992 expiry of the
1964 agreement.
</P>
<P>
However, South Africa says it remains committed to the
implementation of the trade protocol through a process of
intensive regional negotiations and consultations.
</P>
<P>
Tariffs on textile and trade in a wide range of agricultural
products have been reviewed following an agreement signed last
August. A business promotion exhibition was held recently to
foster partnership among business people from the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Blanchfield has been a consistently fierce critic of South
Africa over its alleged foot dragging in concluding an agreement
that benefits both countries. She added that the practice of
closing down South African subsidiaries in Zimbabwe in favour of
creating warehouses for its products should bring "shame to
moral" South Africans.
</P>
<P>
But she said: "there is still time and scope for change if we
all adopt positive attitudes."

ISLAMABAD, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Gohar Ayub Khan said today the government is looking into the
shooting incident in which four Americans were killed by
unidentified gunmen in Karachi, Pakistan's biggest port city.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Inspector General Malik Iqbal is heading the
investigation into the killings, Gohar said, adding that President
Farooq Leghari and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif have been informed
of the tragic incident.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Interior Ministry or the Foreign Ministry,
he said, would be released in the afternoon after further details

The four U.S. citizens, who were on a visit in connection with
official work at Union Texas Karachi, were gunned down by
unidentified assailants at around 8:20 a.m. on their way from
Karachi Sheraton Hotel to their office, located about three
kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
According to witnesses, the assailants were in a Red Honda
Civic, which was later found abandoned in a nearby area.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. embassy officials here when contacted declined
to make any comment on the incident, saying they were still
gathering details.
</P>
<P>
The incident came one day after a 12-member jury declared a
Pakistani national, Aimal Kansi, guilty of killing two CIA agents
and wounding three others in the January, 1993 shooting outside
the Central Intelligence Agency headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy on Tuesday warned all American citizens in
Pakistan to be on alert keeping in mind a possible retaliation

<HEADLINE> IAF Trained for Non-Conventional Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 12 (Xinhua) -- In a rare revelation of its
defense capabilities against non-conventional weapons, a senior
Israel Air Force (IAF) officer said IAF pilots and ground crews
are trained with gas masks on and that some hangars are protected
through filters and air-pressure systems.
</P>
<P>
"The most relevant threat against the air force today is from
ground-to-ground missiles, and the missiles are capable of being
armed with both conventional and non-conventional warheads," the
Jerusalem Post newspaper today quoted the IAF's head of behavioral
department Lt.-Col. Arnon as reporting.
</P>
<P>
Arnon said the focus of the Israeli air defense is directly at
Syria, which has hundreds of Scud missiles capable of reaching
most of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arnon said that NBC (nuclear, biological and chemical) warfare
protection is practiced in all branches of the IAF.
</P>
<P>
"During an anti-aircraft exercise, you can see everyone going
around in NBC protective clothings as they go through the alerts
and firing their missiles under all conditions," Arnon said,
adding that "there is a massive deployment to continue fighting
during an attack."
</P>
<P>
All IAF anti-aircraft batteries along the northern front are
mobile and able to jump from firing station to station on short
notice, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the current IAF assumption is that the Arab
states do not have nuclear weapons, and that the aim of the
training of IAF staff is to enable tactical warfare to continue
under biological or chemical attack.

settlement mechanism against the European Union's (EU's) recent
initiation of an anti-subsidy case against India's exports of
stainless steel bright bars, official sources said here today.

The EU had earlier notified the Indian government and the
latter had agreed to hold talks. Yet the EU did not even wait for
the first round of talks but initiated action in the case against
India, said the sources.

<P>
Prior to the probe, the EU had initiated an anti-subsidy case
against India's exports of pharmaceutical items, making this the
second case in two months, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
India argues that all the export schemes are "conceptually
designed as reimbursements" and not overt subsidies.

<HEADLINE> World Mineral Prices to Pick Up: Zimbabwean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior official from Zimbabwe
Chamber of Mines predicted the world mineral prices will recover
from the current decline and urged the mining industry
to concentrate on improving productivity and quality of
minerals to earn more money for the country.
</P>
<P>
John Nixon, President of the Chamber of Mines said on Tuesday,
local explorations showed that the future of the industry was not
bleak. A number of foreign and local companies were expected to
commission new mines in the near future.
</P>
<P>
But there was need to cut production costs and gear up for
regional and international competition, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot do anything about the falling prices, but we can do
something about our productivity and reduce costs," Nixon noted.
</P>
<P>
The world is currently undergoing an unprecedented slump in
the price of gold, nickel, copper and ferrochrome among others.
</P>
<P>
"What we need is to keep an eye on the trends of events in the
world because we have no god given right to mining since other
countries are also developing their own projects," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nixon predicted that prices would improve, but not before the
depression had claimed casualties in the form of retrenchments.
</P>
<P>
Plummeting world mineral prices, mounting production costs and
high wage bills had thrown the Zimbabwean mining sector into
viability problems, forcing some companies to retrench thousands
of workers or even close operations.

<HEADLINE> Grand Ecological Project Well Underway in Qinghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- A grand-scale, trans-century
ecological project in northwest China's plateau province of
Qinghai is well underway and will go far to protect the fragile
local ecological situation.
</P>
<P>
The province accommodates the sources of some major rivers in
China, including the Yangtze, Yellow and Lancang rivers. However,
highland climate and scarce plantation result in severe soil
erosion in an area of 331,400 sq km which makes up 46 percent of
the province's territory.
</P>
<P>
There also exist serious desertification and deteriorating
grasslands. And snowstorms and droughts occur frequently because
of the drastic changes in plateau weather.
</P>
<P>
The ecological project will last till 2030. For the time being,
priority is put on improving forest environment and soil and water
conservation along the upper reaches of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, ecological agriculture will be boosted and dry
mountains in the province's eastern part will receive
comprehensive treatment. As a result, all farmland will be
terraced by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
By 2030, more than half of the areas which now suffer from soil
erosion will see improvements.

<HEADLINE> China's Autumn-Winter Sowing Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- China has sown winter grain
crops on 25.6 million ha of land so far this year, accounting for
85 percent of the planned planting area.
</P>
<P>
Wheat, a principal winter crop, has been planted on 24.3
million ha of land, making up 93 percent of the set area, said an
official from the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Autumn-Winter sowing in north China is basically completed. Ten
major wheat-growing provinces have sown crops on 16 million ha of
land. The crops planted on time are growing well, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Winter sowing has started in all southern provinces and is
expected to be completed by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
China has experienced a rarely seen drought this spring, summer
and autumn, posing a threat to the planting and management of
winter wheat.
</P>
<P>
North China has received no widespread rainfall since
mid-September, and what's worse, the period has been windy with
high temperatures. As a result, soil moisture quickly evaporated.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 10 million ha of farmland across China
have been affected by drought. The areas sustaining drought in
north China totalled 7.3 million ha.
</P>
<P>
In Henan Province, a leading wheat producer, 3.4 million ha of
wheat fields badly need water, and wheat on 4.6 million ha of land
in east China's Shandong Province is parched and nearly ruined.
</P>
<P>
A mass campaign to save young crops is spreading in the
country. Hebei, Shandong and Henan provinces have replanted wheat
on 4.1 million ha of land.
</P>
<P>
Wang Wenxue, deputy governor of Shanxi province, urged power
and water conservancy departments to use all water facilities for
irrigation. Jiangsu, Anhui and Hubei provinces have been organized
to fight drought and improve field management.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian
government has ordered refugees from other African countries not
to move out of camps as a measure to tighten security of the
surroundings, The Guardian reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a recent Regional Emergency Management Workshop,
Joseph Rugumyamheto, Principal Secretary in the President's
Office responsible for the Civil Service Department, said the
government found it necessary to take drastic measures to contain
the source of trouble.
</P>
<P>
He said apart from financial burden, the country faces
security problems particularly in areas sheltering the refugees.
There is also the problem of environment degradation, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately we have had little support in this regard,
Instead we are blamed by many people while
the international community has kept silent," Rugumyamheto noted.
</P>
<P>
Political turmoil that has taken place in the
neighboring countries over the past few years has created a
massive influx of refugees from Rwanda, Burundi, Somalia, and
other African countries.
</P>
<P>
Rugumyamheto said Tanzania currently hosts more than 800,000
refugees, 200,000 of whom have been given land to cultivate.
</P>
<P>
Currently refugees in camps in the northwestern regions of
Kigoma and Kagera have exceeded 300,000 in number. Others have
settled in different settlements across the country.

<P>
Australia is reported to have agreed to a six-year phaseout

MOSCOW, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Russia has gathered in 94
million tons of grain by the end of October, 26.3 percent or 24.7
million tons up from last year, according to the Russian State
Statistical Committee today.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the committee also show that production of
potatos and vegetables reached 33.7 million tons and 8.3 million
tons respectively.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the committee says, the amount of livestock, such as
pigs, cows, chickens, is also on the rise, while milk output per
cow and egg output per hen has increased by more than 5.6 percent
each.
</P>
<P>
The improvement of Russian agriculture is mainly due to the
instituting of various forms of ownership, that give great
incentives to farmers by expanding grain-producing areas.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Russian government has made available 12 trillion
rubbles (about 2 billion U.S. dollars) in soft loans to ensure an
ample supply of agricultural production materials.
</P>
<P>
Russia is a country with the great potential for agricultural
development. It has the world's largest farming area of 220
million hectares, of which, 134 million are already cultivated.

BANGKOK, November 12 (Xinhua) -- A type of asbestos used in
tile production can cause lung cancer, a Thai health official said
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Crysotile fibre, a type of asbestos that Thai manufacturers
import to produce tiles, contains a carcinogenic substance that
can cause lung cancer and asbestosis, Wilawan Juengprasert from
the Thai Public Health Ministry was quoted as saying by local
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The health department of the ministry will seek a ban on the
use of crysotile fibre, she said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has banned the use of other kinds of asbestos which
contain carcinogenic substances in the production of tile, brake
and clutch pads, and durable cloth, wilawan said.
</P>
<P>
The crysotile fibre currently is the only type still allowed in
the production of these products in Thailand, she said.
</P>
<P>
Crysotile fibre can cause lung cancer, the official said, but
it takes more than 30 years for the symptoms to appear.
</P>
<P>
Thailand currently imports about 100,000 tons of crysotile
fibre each year, she said.

year, the national news agency BSS reported here today.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by State Minister for Fisheries and

<HEADLINE> New Thai Government Attaches Importance to Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Tourism needs an urgent push
while Thailand improves its framework to attract foreign
investment, Supachai Panitchpakdi, who is expected to become chief
economic minister of the new Thai government, told a seminar
entitled "Thai Travel and Tourism: What Next" here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new government's most pressing task was to generate hard
currency earnings to rescue the economy, Supachai was quoted today
by local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said this would entail strengthening tourism, promoting
exports and improving the attractiveness of the country to
international investors.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said that while other countries were attempting to
increase promotional privileges to attract foreign investors, the
fall in the value of the baht had already provided good support.
</P>
<P>
To attract investment, the tax structure must be changed, the
foreign shareholding ratio increased, private industrial estates
promoted and flexible entry and residence permits issued to
foreigners, he said.
</P>
<P>
"These things have been discussed before but have never been
seriously implemented. The new Thai government will speed up the
process and make the plan come true as soon as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, export manufacturers would need help not only with
cash flow, but also in terms of product quality, meeting both
international standards and environmental concerns, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Next year will be one of major adjustment. We need to
fine-tune our economy for a better future," Supachai said.
</P>
<P>
He said exports and tourism had the highest potential to earn
foreign funds. But the fluctuations in the value of the baht had
caused confusion and businesses, particularly in tourism, should
catch up with the new environment.
</P>
<P>
Although the Tourism Authority of Thailand was preparing to
launch the "Amazing Thailand" 1998-99 campaign, there was a need
for immediate action, Supachai said.
</P>
<P>
"The campaign is good. But when we consider Thailand's need to
repay more than 20 billion US dollars in foreign debt within two
months, more urgent plans are needed. At least the campaign should
tell the world of the excellent value Thailand is offering," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank Eases Cross-Shareholding Limit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand Tuesday
eased its cross-shareholding limit and allowed a sound local
financial institution to hold a majority stake in another firm.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rule, a sound local financial institution could
hold a stake of more than 49 percent in another firm for ten year.
</P>
<P>
The new rule will facilitate capital increases in the country's
financial sector, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
To date, the bank previously only allowed a local financial
institution to hold a maximum holding of ten percent in another
firm.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that Bangkok Bank, one of the country's
largest commercial banks, Tuesday hailed the new
cross-shareholding rule as a positive sign to strengthen the
country's financial sector, Saying it will widen the channel for
mergers of commercial banks in the future.
</P>
<P>
Also, the central bank Tuesday reiterated its policy to allow
foreigners to hold a stake of more than 49 percent in a local
financial institution for ten years to help the cash-trapped local
financial institutions to raise capital and improve management.
</P>
<P>
The policy was introduced by the Chavalit Government earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the central bank reserved the right to refuse a foreign
bank to open a full branch in Thailand if it holds a majority
stake in a Thai bank.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that the central bank's latest move was
approved by outgoing finance minister Kosit Panpiemras and
announced before new government ministers come into power.

announced that it had taken over the British Petroleum's (BP's)
entire service station network in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
It was the largest takeover deal in recent years in Thailand's
oil business, local newspapers said today.
</P>
<P>
Caltex announced on Tuesday that it had concluded an agreement
with the BP for the deal worth 1 billion baht (about 27 million US
dollars) to take over its 48 service stations around Thailand.
</P>
<P>
After the takeover, the number of the Caltex firm's service
stations throughout Thailand will increase to 611 and its market
share also increase to about 13.5 percent, the newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
The takeover took place as Thailand is undergoing an economic
slowdown, which has forced many oil service stations to shut down
and pinched the others.
</P>
<P>
The deal is a big gamble amid deep and broad problems facing
the Thai economy, Richard Abrams, managing director of the Caltex
Oil (Thailand) Ltd, was quoted as saying by local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
But he expressed confidence in a long-term recovery of the Thai
economy.
</P>
<P>
The Caltex firm currently is the fourth largest oil marketer in
Thailand, while the BP firm is the sixth.
</P>
<P>
The Petroleum Authority of Thailand currently is the largest,
which captured 27.3 percent of the Thai market during January and
August this year. It is followed by Shell and Esso.

BANGKOK, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Commerce Ministry
will strongly promote exports by the food industry as the sector's
fundamentals are competitive, according to Sanit Vorapanya,
director-general of the Export Promotion Department of the

Meanwhile, Surapon, president of the Food Industry Club of
Thailand, said the country remained one of the world's leading

<HEADLINE> Chile Adjusts Copper Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Chile's Copper Commission
(Cochilco) has adjusted its previous forecast for the average
price of copper per pound for the year, because of difficulties in
quotations during the second half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The list of prices, published today by the local press, puts
the average price for 1997 between 1.03 and 1.05 U.S. dollars a
pound, a price similar to the 1996 close of 1.039 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Over the first half, Cochilco estimated the copper price at
1.00 to 1.05 dollars per pound, but the forecast was upgraded due
to a steady demand, registering average prices above 1.10 dollars
per pound.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging those facts, the authority estimated that the
price of copper would approach 1.08 dollars per pound.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, copper's price started to fall, caused by
depressed economic activities in the northern hemisphere. The
price of the metal plunged Monday to 0.886 dollars, the lowest
since October 30, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Because of the current conditions of the market, Cochilco had
to readjust downwards the average price estimate for this
year.

QUITO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador exported 3.69 million
tons of bananas in the first 10 months of 1997, a 17 percent
increase over the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The exports earned 1.09 billion U.S. dollars for the country.
</P>
<P>
In October alone, exports of bananas amounted to 348,289 tons,
7.4 percent above the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, 4.2 million tons of the fruit will
have been shipped abroad earning more than 1.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Banana prices are expected to rise in international markets
because of low production in Central America and the Caribbean
caused by droughts.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador is the biggest banana exporter in the world. Last year
it shipped 3.84 million tons abroad.

<HEADLINE> Pension, Wage Reforms Deadlocked in Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's pension and wage
reforms have run into a deadlock following President Leonid
Kuchma's rejection of an attempt by the leftist-dominated
parliament to raise the minimum pension on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said the decision of the Supreme Soviet (the Ukrainian
parliament) to raise the minimum pension to 70.9 gryvnas (about 38
U.S. dollars) a month would bankrupt the country. The Supreme
Soviet passed the legislation to raise minimum pension on June 4
this year.
</P>
<P>
The president said the government would have to pay 25.6
billion gryvnas (13.7 billion dollars) to the State Pension Fund
(SPF) if the legislation came into effect. In fact, the SPF is
expected to pay 9.2 billion gryvnas (4.9 billion dollars) in
pensions.
</P>
<P>
At present, the average pension in Ukraine is 45 gryvnas (24
dollars) for the 17 million pensioners. Ukraine has a population
of 51.6 million.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma also vetoed a law to raise the minimum wage which the
parliament passed on October 15. The law would raise the minimum
wage from 15 gryvnas (eight dollars) to 73.7 gryvnas (about 39
dollars) a month after January 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
He said the parliament failed to state the source of funds for
the increases since Ukraine's economy had shown no sign of
recovery, even for the coming year.
</P>
<P>
Observers claim left-wing lawmakers tried to please voters by
passing these two laws as the parliamentary elections
approached. At a time when the government was unable to pay its
workers properly, the legislation would gain support from voters
and force the president into a very difficult "corner".

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Prices, Currency Stable: Bank Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Stable prices and steady currency
are the two noteworthy successes Ukraine has achieved in the
economic sphere, governor of the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU)
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The two successes may facilitate the development of a
favorable investment climate in the country," Viktor Yushchenko
said to an international conference "Development and Cooperation
on Banking and Investment Activities" held here.
</P>
<P>
He said the Ukrainian currency, gryvna, which went into
circulation in September 1996, has so far devaluated by only 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko added: "The currency's stability is secured by the
foreign currency reserves of the NBU," that now goes up to 4.7
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The governor also mentioned that the Ukrainian government has
successfully reined inflation from 39.7 percent in 1996 to about
7.6 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
However, some financial experts disagree with the
governor. "The stability of the gryvna and the low inflation are
achieved at the cost of most Ukrainians' living standards," said a
researcher from the Ukrainian Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
He said prices will skyrocket if every family gets its back
wages and pensions in billions of dollars.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government to Appeal Against Supreme Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
decided to file a motion for reconsideration of last week's
Supreme Court ruling nullifying the oil deregulation law and to
pursue filing of a new bill.
</P>
<P>
The government had agreed to file an appeal to prevent the
court decision, which was scheduled to take effect on November 21,
from being final and executory, local press reports quoted Finance
Secretary Roberto de Ocampo as saying.
</P>
<P>
The High Tribunal last week struck down the nine-month-old oil
deregulation law as unconstitutional, saying some of its
provisions encouraged the country's three dominant oil companies
to gain monopoly.
</P>
<P>
The oil deregulation law, which took effect in February this
year, encouraged firms to invest in refineries in the country and
firms that were just importing and selling finished products were
charged higher tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The court said forcing firms to choose between investing huge
amounts in refineries or paying higher tariffs amounted to a
restriction on free trade and violated the intention of the law.
</P>
<P>
De Ocampo said the government would file a new bill that would
leave the tariff setting to President Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
He said the government still favored setting higher tariffs on
finished petroleum products but would be willing to give
concession to new players.
</P>
<P>
Currently, crude imports have a tariff of three percent, while
imported finished products have a rate of seven percent.
</P>
<P>
Ramos has urged the Congress to speed up the passage of a new
oil deregulation law to save the country's liberalized oil
industry.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Jose de Venecia said he expected Congress to pass
a new oil reform law before Christmas.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Legislator Urges Peaceful Solution of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations should
comprehensively view the Iraq question and not only from its
mistakes but from the suffering of its people due to the UN
embargo on the Middle East country, an Indonesian legislator said.
</P>
<P>
"We call on all countries to prove whether or not Iraq has been
developing destructive weapons. Middle East countries should be
united in taking their stand on the matter," Chairperson of the
House of Representatives' Commission I Mrs. Aisyah Aminy said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Aminy expressed optimism that the Iraq question could be solved
through peaceful dialogue, sources at the house said today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another legislator H. Lukman Harun said the UN and
the U.S. should take rational and fair stand on Iraq because the
U.S. under the name of the UN Security Council has so far tried to
attack Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. had so far employed double standard on Iraq.
On one hand the U.S. had supported Israel, while on the other hand
it sometimes took military actions against Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
As a superpower, the U.S. should be ashamed of attacking Iraq,
he said.
</P>
<P>
he said the U.S. action against Iraq was tantamount to human
rights violations.
</P>
<P>
"I think that Iraqi people have much sacrificed. Let us not add
another suffering. The Iraq government should concentrate on
developing the economy. We hope that the Organization of Islamic
Conference will play a bigger role in the matter," he added.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has banned U.S. weapon inspectors from entering into
Iraq. The U.S., backed by Britain, has not ruled out the use of
military farce in retaliation.

<HEADLINE> Waigel: Germany will Meet Euro Criteria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- German Finance Minister Theo
el today said that Germany will be able to meet the budgetary
requirement of the planned single European currency despite an
expected huge shortfall in tax revenues in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Waigel's remarks came after a government-appointed tax estimate
group released its latest projections earlier today, saying that
Germany would face a shortfall of 17.3 billion marks (10 billion
U.S. dollars) in tax revenues in 1997 and even a bigger one of
22.4 billion marks (13 billion dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to already planned cuts in job-creation subsidies, a
spending freeze, further privatization of state-own companies and
delaying repayment of national debts inherited from the former
East Germany, Germany's budget deficit for 1997 would not
overshoot the previously agreed level of 71.2 billion marks (42
billion dollars) and would even be reduced to 57 billion (33
billion dollars) next year, Waigel said.
</P>
<P>
"We will meet the Maastricht Treaty criteria for both years,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the EU Maastricht Treaty, EU states are required, among
other things, to bring their budget deficit to less than three
percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in order to join the
single currency, the Euro.

<HEADLINE> Powell Says He's Not Running for President in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Retired General Colin
Powell said Tuesday he will not seek the Republican presidential
nomination or any other office in 2000.
</P>
<P>
"I went through this in 1995. I took a hard look at myself and
took a look at the needs of my family and I concluded individually
and we concluded as a family that political life was not for us,"
The Associated Press quoted Powell as saying at a news conference
in Des Moine, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
"I am not running for any political office in 2000," he said.
</P>
<P>
Powell, who was former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
is heading President Bill Clinton's national volunteerism effort.
He had said before that he had no intention of running for
president.
</P>
<P>
Powell spokesman Bill Smullen said the retired general has
ruled out a presidential race in less formal settings. "Whenever
it comes up, that's his standard answer."
</P>
<P>
He raised some eyebrows when he agreed to speak at a
motivational conference in Des Moines Tuesday. With its precinct
caucuses opening the presidential nominating season, Iowa gets
heavy attention from presidential candidates of both parties.
Powell quickly made his point
</P>
<P>
"I am not a candidate for political office," he said. "I made
that decision in 1995 after a great deal of deliberation. I plan
to devote my energies to the work I'm doing in private life,
charitable work, educational work."
</P>
<P>
"I was never a politician, nor did I consider political office
before 1995," Powell said. "It came up and was the subject of
great interest and speculation. I considered it and decided that
was not where I would spend my life."
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have the passion for it and I didn't have the
commitment to that kind of life," he said. "I'm still principally
a soldier."

Iraq would defend its rights in the face of a possible

Iraq has repeatedly accused the U.S. weapons inspectors of
espionage and has threatened to shoot down the U2 plane used by
the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf called for refraining from making a linkage between the
issue of sanctions and that of banned weapons. He indicated that
Iraq had suggested that the U.N. Special Commission on dismantling
Iraqi weapons of mass destruction be composed of all the five
standing members of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion is aimed at making the commission a neutral one,
preventing it from misleading the public opinion by saying that
Iraq hides banned weapons, he said.
</P>
<P>
He complained that the Security Council does not heed Iraq, but
only listens to the special commission.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the Security Council might find a way
for dialog with Iraq on the current crisis. He said Iraq finds
itself in a position where there is no hope whatsoever for the
lifting of the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in
1990 cannot be lifted until the inspectors verify that Iraq has
eliminated all its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"We hoped," the Iraqi foreign minister said, "that the other
side would respect its commitments towards Iraq as we did respect
our commitments toward the international resolutions."
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf concluded his statements by underlining Monday's
American provocation by sending a U2 aircraft to overfly Iraqi
airspace, hoping that this mistake would not be repeated.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Bahrain to Reaccredit Ambassadors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Bahrain today
agreed to reaccredit their ambassadors to each other, a signal
for the return of the two countries' bilateral relations to
normal track.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced after the meeting between Iranian
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi and his Bahraini counterpart
Sheikh Mohammed bin Mubarak al-Khalifa in the Bahraini capital
of Manama this afternoon, the Bahraini news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Bahraini foreign minister told reporters that during their
 meeting, he and Kharrazi "exchanged views on...improving ties,
restructuring trust and removing obstacles" between the two
countries and they agreed to resend ambassadors to each other.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain and Iran recalled their ambassadors in May last year
after a row on Bahrain's unrest. Manama accused Iran of being
behind the 19-month wave of riots in Bahrain. Tehran denied the
accusation.
</P>
<P>
After more than one year of tense relations, Bahrain
expressed welcome to the Iranian foreign minister's visit.
</P>
<P>
Khalifa said that Kharrazi's visit is "a signal from the new
Iranian authorities" to mend fences with Bahrain and other Gulf
states.
</P>
<P>
Kaharazzi arrived in Bahrain today on a two-day official visit
as part of his tour to the Gulf region to improve its strained
ties with its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been trying to reach out to its Arab Gulf neighbours
across the Gulf since Iran's President Mohammad Khatami formed a
new government in August.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister's tour comes one month before the
December 9-11 meeting of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC) in Iranian capital Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Iran feverishly hopes to make the meeting an unprecedented
gathering of foreign dignitaries. Around 50 heads of states,
including Bahrain, have been invited to the convention.
</P>
<P>
Khalifa said that during his talks with the visiting Iranian
foreign minister, they also discussed the upcoming conference.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain is the third leg of Kharrazi's tour which has taken
him to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and will also take him to Qatar,
Oman and the UAE.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Launches Counter-Sanction on US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, November 11 (Xinhua) -- In a counter-measure against
U.S. economic sanctions, Sudan said today it will bar exports of
Arab gum to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Speaker of the Sudanese National Assembly (parliament)
Hassan Abdulla al Turabi made the announcement when addressing a
number of officials in Ad-Daher, the River Nile Province, some 500
kilometers north of Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that the United States would kneel down
before Sudan and ask it to give the U.S. oil firms concessions in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese decision is of the same kind as the new
U.S. economic sanctions, he pointed out, urging the Sudanese
people to boycott the U.S.-made products.
</P>
<P>
The United States imports some 20,000 tonnes of Arab gum from
Sudan annually, or a quarter of its total need.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese decision is expected to harm 63 U.S. firms that
import the Arab gum from Sudan and will have to buy it from
European countries against higher prices.
</P>
<P>
Washington announced early this month new and extensive
economic sanctions against Sudan for its alleged support for
international terrorism and human rights record. The sanctions
include freezing all Sudanese assets in the U.S. and barring
U.S. investment, bank loans and trade on selected items.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: U.N. Inspectors "Must Get Back to Work" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Tuesday said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has no right to
prevent U.N. weapons inspection teams from working and called on
the international community to demand that they be allowed to do
their job.
</P>
<P>
"Saddam's efforts to rebuild his weapons of mass destruction
and his interference with the United Nations inspectors who are
keeping him from doing so are unacceptable," Clinton said at
Veterans Day ceremonies at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
"They are doing what they should be doing," he said. "They
must get back to work and the international community must
demand it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the inspectors "since 1991, have discovered and
destroyed more weapons of mass destruction potential than was
destroyed in Iraq during the entire Gulf War."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis said American inspectors in U.N. weapons inspection
teams were gathering sensitive intelligence informations in their
country under the guise of working for U.N. inspections.
</P>
<P>
They demanded that Americans leave the U.N. weapons
inspection teams and asked the United Nations to re-compose
these inspection teams before they re-start their work.
