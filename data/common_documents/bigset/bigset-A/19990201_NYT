Atlanta Falcons and their head coach Dan Reeves watch time fly away
along with their chances for a Super Bowl victory Sunday. Reeves'
old team, the Denver Broncos, defeated the Falcons 34-19 in Super

worst enemy, and Elway got a measure of revenge on Reeves, who
coached him in three Super Bowl losses and left Denver in 1992 at
odds with the quarterback. (Jose R. Lopez/New York Times Photo)

pornography on the World Wide Web. Critics of the law say that if
it goes into effect, it could force a variety of Web site operators

Marrakesh, Morocco. In general, women are treated as inferior under
Morocco's Koranic laws: they are legal minors, inherit only half a

center run by a Swiss foundation in Agadir, Morocco. In a country
where abortion is forbidden by law and a woman who has a child out

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Chris Chandler's dream week ended with a rude awakening
on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   During the week leading to this Super Bowl, the Atlanta Falcons'
veteran found a number of people comparing him favorably to the
opposing quarterback, a probable Hall of Famer named John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Chandler's supporters said, he had a higher passing
efficiency rating this season than Elway, had career-bests in
yardage and touchdowns and threw just 12 interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night was a starkly different story, though, as the
Broncos largely muted Atlanta's offense in a 34-19 victory at Pro
Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos swarmed Chandler (19 of 35 for 219 yards) with a
high-leaping pass rush, sacking him twice and forcing three
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler did provide Atlanta's only offensive touchdown _ a
3-yard pass to wide receiver Terance Mathis with 2 minutes 4
seconds left _ but by then, the winner of this game had been
assured.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays haunted Chandler as he addressed the news media
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The first came midway through the third quarter, with Denver
leading by 17-6 and Atlanta 21 yards away from the end zone. His
pass for Mathis was deflected by defensive tackle Keith Traylor and
intercepted by cornerback Darrien Gordon, who streaked to the
Atlanta 21. It led to a Broncos touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their cornerbacks sink to the middle on coverage and all I
have to do is throw it over their head on a sideline pattern,''
Chandler said. ``This one would have been just another one of
those, except it was deflected.''
</P>
<P>
   The second nightmare came several minutes later, with Atlanta
still trying to make a game of it. From the Denver 26, Chandler
aimed for wide receiver Tony Martin and Gordon again made the
interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was 100 percent missed communication,'' Chandler said.
``He decided at the last second to go over the top and I thought he
was going to run a sharper, flatter pattern. The only guy who was
right was Gordon.''
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback who has found a home finally with his sixth
National Football League team then paused, not wanting to sound too
much like a whining loser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could tell you all kinds of things that happened in this
game,'' he said, ``but they would sound like excuse making. And
that's not really an important thing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Robinson, the Denver defensive coordinator, said his unit
used 10 types of pressure schemes on Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't let him get comfortable,'' he said. ``We were
keeping our distance on a lot of coverages, because we didn't want
him to beat us deep. But I think we affected his timing with our
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Denver defense allowed only two touchdowns in three
post-season games. Though Chandler was responsible for one of them,
he said: ``It got pretty frustrating out there. We were getting
close, but they were tough in the red zone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons tried to establish some semblance of a running
attack early in the game. Chandler attempted just three passes in
the first quarter, and his lone completion gained only 4 yards.
</P>
<P>
   In two series that bridged the first and second quarters, the
quarterback threw one pass, and it was incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   He finally came out throwing on Atlanta's fourth drive _
completing three passes in a row for 55 yards _ but as the Falcons
drew closer to Denver's goal line, they returned mostly to the run.
</P>
<P>
   Three straight Jamal Anderson runs put them at the Broncos'
8-yard line. A long commercial timeout interrupted play at this
point, and Chandler's wild pass afterward made it look as if his
timing had been affected.
</P>
<P>
   That left it to normally reliable Morten Andersen to get
something out of the drive. But his 26-yard field goal attempt was
wide right.
</P>
<P>
   In a way that described Atlanta's offense on this night, too.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler is mindful that the next Super Bowl is in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to look forward to doing this again, back at our
place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he got up and left the interview room, as the lights went
dark. &QL;

SHANAHAN ALREADY TALKING REPEAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Mike Shanahan repeated himself on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan, who became the first coach to win a pair of Super
Bowls in his first four seasons, addressed the Denver Broncos'
defense of the crown, just as he did last year after his team upset
Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them the off-season program starts the day after
tomorrow, and hopefully we'll have the same type of off season as
last year,'' Shanahan said after the Broncos' 34-19 victory over
the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   The coach has again set the bar high.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's harder the second time,'' he said. ``But we decided that
this season we would be satisfied with nothing less than a Super
Bowl. It was our goal from the beginning. It was a high goal, but
our players really stayed in there throughout the season.
Obviously, this was a dream come true.''
</P>
<P>
   But now he may have to do it without John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left a bunch of guys trying to talk him into three-peat,''
Shanahan said after leaving the locker room. ``I don't know if
they're getting to him or not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's John's last game. I think there's a
chance it could be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to go out, what a way to go out,'' he said of
Elway, the game's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   When the Broncos' owner, Pat Bowlen, handed Shanahan the Vince
Lombardi Trophy, the coach said: ``It feels awfully good. I would
like John to come back for a third time. He's going to have to sit
down and talk with his family.''
</P>
<P>
   While Elway was the game's mvp, Shanahan did his own most
valuable part. He oversaw a game plan that the Falcons were not
prepared for _ most noticeably on the goal-line situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the plan was going to Howard Griffith,'' he said. ``We
felt that Atlanta did a great job on the goal line keying to the
primary ballcarrier.''
</P>
<P>
   So Elway faked handoffs to Davis and gave the football to
Griffith, who scored a pair of touchdowns, getting only a total of
9 yards on 4 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Those scores helped Shanahan achieve 32 victories over the last
two seasons, the Broncos having reacted to the constant pressure
from their coach to keep improving. It is why the Broncos haven't
lost a game in which they led at halftime since September 1996, and
it is why they outscored the opposition by 47-9 in the regular
season on opening drives.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos have been relentless, and they have been relentless
over time. The even had to overcome what Shanahan describes as
``adversity'' _ the loss to the New York Giants after having won
the first 13 games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Shanahan is raising the bar even higher.

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
MIAMI _ If Super Bowl XXXIII turns out to be the last game of
Denver quarterback John Elway's magnificent career, he went out in
the kind of style usually reserved for legends.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elway was the unquestioned star of the Broncos' 34-19 victory
over the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday, throwing for 336 yards and a
touchdown to help Denver win its second consecutive Super Bowl. He
also ran for a touchdown and was the unanimous selection as the
game's Most Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won a car?'' Elway asked in regard to his MVP award.
``That's all I need _ another car.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway owns automobile dealerships in Denver, and after Sunday's
performance in which he helped pluck Atlanta's Dirty Birds, he owns
Colorado. He may enter the political arena after his retirement,
which he is expected to announce sometime in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even want to talk about retirement right now,'' Elway
said. ``I want to enjoy this win. This definitely throws a kink in
it (his retirement plans), but I don't have to cross that bridge
for a while. I got emotional a couple of times, but I think that
emotion helped me.''
</P>
<P>
   On a weekend in which Falcons safety Eugene Robinson brought
shame on his family and teammates after being charged with
solicitation of a prostitute, Elway was a shining example of
everything that is good about the game in front of a Pro Player
Stadium crowd of 74,802 and a worldwide television audience.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos are in position to become the first team to win
three consecutive Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of guys in this dressing room talking to John
about a three-peat, but I don't know if they'll be successful,''
Denver coach Mike Shanahan said. ``I don't know if it'll be his
last game _ I suspect it will _ but if you're going to go out, what
a way to go out.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway, who completed 18 of his 29 passes, convincingly outplayed
his Atlanta counterpart, Chris Chandler. Chandler was 19-of-35 for
219 yards and a touchdown. He was intercepted three times in the
second half, when the Broncos blew the game open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We confused him,'' said Denver cornerback Darrien Gordon, who
intercepted two passes. ``Our coverage was good. It seemed like he
had happy feet. When the quarterback's got people in his face, it's
hard for him to step up and throw. All the credit should go to our
guys up front.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway, who sparked a 457-yard attack, was far from alone in
helping Denver become the seventh team to win consecutive Super
Bowls and the first since Dallas after the 1992 and 1993 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Terrell Davis rushed for 102 yards on 25 carries.
It was his seventh consecutive 100-yard playoff game, including
three this season. Fullback Howard Griffith scored on a pair of
one-yard runs. Receiver Rod Smith had five catches for 152 yards
and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's two interceptions set up touchdowns. He had four
interceptions combined in the Super Bowl and AFC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos' defense, which plays in the shadow of a highly
rated, well-publicized offense, surrendered only one touchdown
Sunday, and that came when the game was out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   In playoff victories over the Dolphins, Jets and Falcons, the
Broncos' defense allowed two touchdowns total, one on a one-yard
drive after a blocked punt against the Jets and the other in the
waning moments Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that we don't give up many points,'' Gordon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Though they didn't commit a penalty, the Falcons, who upset
Minnesota in the NFC Championship Game, didn't play as if they
belonged in the Super Bowl. Cornerback Ray Buchanan shot off his
mouth and guaranteed a Falcons victory, but the only thing
guaranteed was coach Dan Reeves' joining Minnesota's Bud Grant and
Buffalo's Marv Levy as the only coaches to lose four Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't get it done,'' Reeves said. ``We missed that field
goal. We missed a fourth-down attempt. We had to settle for two
field goals. We threw three interceptions. You just can't win if
you don't score when you get in the red zone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons could have been in much better shape after driving
into Denver territory four times in the first half, three times
inside the 20. But they wound up with only two Morten Andersen
field goals to show for their effort.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta reached Denver's eight-yard line before a third-down
sack of Chandler preceded a 32-yard field goal from Andersen. After
cornerback Ronnie Bradford intercepted a pass that bounced off
tight end Shannon Sharpe, who was knocked out of the game in the
first quarter with a torn medial collateral ligament, the Falcons
got the ball at Denver's 35. On fourth-and-one, running back Jamal
Anderson, who would finish with 96 yards on 18 carries, was thrown
for a two-yard loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons again drove to Denver's eight, but Andersen missed a
26-yard field-goal attempt. When Atlanta reached Denver's 11, the
Falcons had to settle for Andersen's 28-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Broncos were taking advantage of just about
everything the Falcons gave them.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind 3-0 on Atlanta's first series, the Broncos
went the distance on their opening possession. The 10-play, 80-yard
drive ended with Griffith scoring on a one-yard run. Elway was
3-of-4 for 67 yards on the drive.
</P>
<P>
   After Anderson was stopped on fourth down by the Broncos, Elway
and Davis took turns making plays to take them to Atlanta's eight.
That series ended with Jason Elam's 26-yard field goal that gave
Denver a 10-3 lead with 9:17 left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons recovered nicely and advanced to the Denver eight,
but Andersen's missed field goal, especially one so short, seemed
to take something out of them.
</P>
<P>
   On the next play, Smith got away from Bradford on the jam and
cut through the middle. Robinson, who couldn't have been in a good
frame of mind after his arrest, allowed Smith to get behind him for
what turned out to be an easy 80-yard touchdown pass. Elam made it
17-3 with 4:54 left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Dwight's 42-yard kickoff return to the Denver 49 gave the
Falcons good field position. They drove to the 11, but after
Chandler threw two incompletions, they had to settle for Andersen's
second field goal and a 17-6 halftime deficit.
</P>
<P>
   On their first possession of the second half, the Broncos drove
from their 26 to Atlanta's 20, but Elam missed a 38-yard field-goal
attempt to ruin the scoring opportunity. It was his first miss of
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Denver did everything to let Atlanta stay in the game, but on
the Falcons' next two series, Chandler threw interceptions. The
first one was intercepted by cornerback Darrius Johnson, but the
Broncos wasted the opportunity when Elam missed a 48-yard
field-goal try.
</P>
<P>
   The next one was tipped at the line by tackle Keith Traylor and
intercepted by Gordon, who returned it 58 yards. This time, the
Broncos didn't waste it when Griffith scored on another one-yard
run for a 24-6 advantage four seconds into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler got the hat trick by throwing a third interception.
Once again, it was Gordon who prevented a touchdown by intercepting
the pass at the Denver two and returning it 50 yards to the Atlanta
48. Gordon set a Super Bowl record with 108 yards on interception
returns.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos capitalized. Davis got them off to a fast start on
the series by taking a short pass and turning it into a 39-yard
gain to the Atlanta nine. Two plays later, Elway ran a quarterback
draw three yards for a touchdown and a 31-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight, who had been close to breaking a touchdown for three
quarters, went the distance on the ensuing kickoff. His 94-yard
return for the touchdown pulled the Falcons within 31-13.
</P>
<P>
   Denver ended its scoring with Elam's 37-yard field goal with
7:08 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons finally scored an offensive touchdown when Terance
Mathis caught a three-yard pass from Chandler with 2:04 left.

REVIEWING THE SUPER BOWL BROADCAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Super Bowl is irony at work.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 30 years now, America has collectively thrown a
Super Bowl TV party on a late Sunday in January in anticipation of
some good football, only to get the equivalent of a sedative.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, the only thing louder than Fox's Terry Bradshaw is
the sound of a few million Americans snoring through the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl XXXIII had its moments for Fox Sports and an audience
of 150 million Sunday, but they were all too brief and
significantly shorter than most of the ceaseless commercial breaks.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the first quarter, one could surmise that Denver
was going to win and that any anticipation left would revolve
around point spreads, office pools and the entertainment value of
the commercials.
</P>
<P>
   By my unofficial count, only seven of the 33 Super Bowls can
officially be labeled as competitive, which means there's been a
whole lot of fill time in TV. Thankfully, John Madden is more than
capable of filling large gaps.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of TV sports critics have speculated that Madden isn't
as interested in his work as he was back in the '80s, when he
became a mythic figure in the business. But he certainly was in
tune Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Madden's antennea were up. On Denver's first
drive, Madden detailed the way the Broncos block for Terrell Davis
and how well they disguise things, to the degree that that
sometimes there's no one for the linement to block.
</P>
<P>
   By Atlanta's second drive, he noted how the Bronco defense had
already adjusted to the Falcons' game plan. After initally loading
eight men in the box, Madden picked up Denver's adjustment and
correctly forecast blitzes on three straight Falcon snaps.
</P>
<P>
   And when Atlanta's Dan Reeves decided to attempt a fourth down
converstion early, Madden called it ``a bad idea'' before Jamal
Anderson was gang tackled for a loss. ``In a close game in the
first half, going for a field goal with a guy like Morten Andersen
is automatic,'' said Madden.
</P>
<P>
   The game sort of went downhill from there, but Madden's
enthusiasm never flagged. He found several themes to replay from
different angles, ranging from why John Elway shouldn't consider
retirement to why Dan Reeves has no reason to feel disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   There were two things Madden and Pat Summerall did not talk
about much: Eugene Robinson's arrest Saturday night and the
Reeves-Mike Shanahan feud.
</P>
<P>
   I can think of a dozen respected play-by-play men who would have
strummed that feud all night. But Madden made a distinction during
the week that the feud was not going to have a big impact on what
happens in the game, and he barely mentioned it.
</P>
<P>
   Given the hyperbole of the Super Bowl, it was rather nice to not
have an issue tattoed on viewers. As far as the Robinson story, Fox
covered it several times in the pregame show, which is where it
belonged. Madden's only reference to it was posed as part of the
game plan: Would Denver attack Robinson early to see if his mind
was still on Biscayne Boulevard?
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Fox unit didn't fare as well as Madden.
Well-known for its technical toys and aggressive attitude, Fox was
rather bland Sunday. Fox's techno graphics were cool, especially
the lineup graphic that popped out of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no buzz to the telecast. The replays viewers saw
were the same replays you could see on any game in October. And
several times, the production team broke one of TV's ten
commandments by using an end zone corner camera for live shots.
</P>
<P>
   That's simply an ego shot. Producers and directors should know
better than to break the comfort wall for viewers. Using obtuse
angles for live shots breaks continuity. One can understand the
desire to try something new, but such experiments should be limited
to a Bears-Rams game in October.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Fox twice arrived late out of a commercial break into a
live play. The second time happened to be John Elway's long
touchdown pass to Rod Smith. Fox didn't try to bury the error; Pat
Summerall even joked about it, saying Fox got caught not being
ready just like the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, Fox is at the mercy of an official on the field who is
supposed to hold play until the network is clear from its breaks.
</P>
<P>
   And America remains at the mercy of an event which produces good
games with the same regularity of a Blue Moon. ABC takes a whack at
keeping the audience (and Dan Dierdorf) awake next year.

SOUTH AFRICAN WARLORD LAID TO REST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, South Africa _ Thousands of mourners from around the
country Sunday buried one of South Africa's most charismatic
figures and dangerous thugs.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed more like a political rally than a funeral. Police and
military formed a tight cordon around this small hillside town to
maintain order during the final rites of Sifiso Nkabinde, a
self-described warlord who was gunned down a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral passed peacefully. But many South Africans fear
Nkabinde's death could rekindle political violence ahead of
national elections later this year. For nearly a decade Nkabinde
was a central figure in the conflict in KwaZulu-Natal Province _ a
bloody rivalry between the African National Congress and the
Inkatha Freedom Party. The strife has claimed nearly 12,000 lives
since 1990 and almost derailed the country's first democratic
elections in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   National and regional political leaders across party lines have
appealed for calm while investigators search for Nkabinde's
killers. ``The death of Sifiso should not usher in a cycle of
revenge that will threaten to destroy the delicate democracy that
is taking its first steps in our nation,'' said Bantu Holomisa, a
friend and political colleague of Nkabinde, at the funeral Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The ANC has blamed the killing on criminals. But many at the
grass-roots level are convinced that Nkabinde died in a political
attack. Ousted from the ANC in 1997 on suspicions that he was an
informer in the early 1990s for the apartheid police, Nkabinde
found a new political home in Holomisa's fledgling United
Democratic Movement, or UDM. He took his supporters with him, and
much of the mourning Sunday found expression in anti-ANC sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ANC said Sifiso was a spy,'' said one young man, refusing
to give his name. ``They have lied. We can't now say we'll have
peace when our brother is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   In its final report, published late last year, the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission found Nkabinde responsible for leading
hit squads and flooding KwaZulu-Natal with weapons. A court
acquitted Nkabinde last year on 16 counts of murder, but his trial
coincided with a telling phenomenon. ``While he was in custody,
violence in Richmond decreased dramatically,'' says Gail Wanenberg,
a former TRC investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Wanenberg believes KwaZulu will be more peaceful without
Nkabinde. But her colleague, Jenny Irish, a longtime peace monitor
in the province, says the warlord's death fits into a troubling new
pattern. Random bloodletting may be less prevalent than it was in
1994, but political assassinations are on the rise. She counts 12
hits in the province in the past year, across the party spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would indicate that there are elements trying to create
instability among the parties in the region,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That is particularly troublesome because the ANC and IFP have
made important strides toward peace in the last year. Leaders of
the two parties have talked about an amnesty for KwaZulu that would
give perpetrators of past violence indemnity from prosecution.
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, the head of the ANC and President
Nelson Mandela's likely successor, has openly courted IFP chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
</P>
<P>
   In political terms, the ANC's interest in finding peace with the
IFP is simple. Inkatha won control of the province in 1994, and the
ANC wants to capture it this year in its quest for a two-thirds
majority in Parliament. Nkabinde's death could disrupt the truce
between the two groups.
</P>
<P>
   Irish says that as long as the joint police-military force, at a
strength of nearly 1,000, remains in Richmond, peace will prevail.
But local IFP leader David Ntombela, a close friend of Nkabinde's,
offers no assurance that the ANC will be safe campaigning in
KwaZulu-Natal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no problem with the UDM,'' he said after Nkabinde's
funeral. ``But if the ANC comes here, that is their concern.''

offered explanations, theories, reasons for his team's funk. He
tried benching players then putting them back out there. He has had
many sleepless nights agonizing over line combinations, power-play
units, goaltending schedules. The players had a separate meeting
after their terrible performance in Pittsburgh with his blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Bruins coach Pat Burns decided to try something new _
brown shoes with a black suit _ in hopes of breaking the hex that
had his club on a four-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. Well, sort of. The Bruins didn't win, they didn't
lose, and they didn't even score but they earned a point in the
standings with a scoreless tie with the Carolina Hurricanes in
their matinee meeting at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't score but we had some great chances,'' said Burns.
``If you keep on doing that, sooner or later it's going to go in.
We kept them off the board. We got a point out of it and that's
what is important. Any point we can pick up from now to the end is
important. I thought we played hard right to the end. As long as we
have some passion and some emotion like this, we'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Byron Dafoe made 24 saves and picked up his 12th career shutout
in his 200th NHL game, his fifth blanking of the season. Carolina
netminder Trevor Kidd earned career shutout No. 15 with 36 saves.
</P>
<P>
   Until Sunday, the Bruins had not posted two scoreless ties in a
season since 1955-56. In 1955, Boston and Detroit shut out each
other on Oct. 22 and Nov. 13. The Bruins' other 0-0 tie this year
was Nov. 7 at Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The first period was a real tractor pull, with neither team
generating much. The second picked up quite a bit for both sides.
The third was the Bruins' best, with the home team generating many
quality chances, but Kidd wouldn't yield.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Ellett on the power play had one of the best chances when
he hit a post after taking a pass from Jason Allison. On a power
play later in the period, the Bruins were all over Kidd again but
couldn't beat him. With 36 seconds left in overtime, Tim Taylor had
a decent opportunity in front but couldn't finish. Boston had by
far the better of the opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins felt they deserved a better fate than the tie but
with the way their fortunes have been lately, they were thrilled to
have something other than a loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we deserved to (win), the way we played,'' said right
wing Rob DiMaio. ``We just didn't find the net tonight. We had
plenty of chances to score, some great, great opportunities but the
puck didn't find its way in.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a good test for us. We knew we had to come out and do
something that was different than what we were doing. Things
weren't working, we were doubting ourselves a little bit. We came
out with a game plan that we were going to play a smart game and we
limited their chances. It was a good step, something to be positive
about.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a trying time for the Bruins lately but the coach is
keeping a stiff upper lip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not disappointed, I'm not frustrated at all,'' said Burns.
``I'm certainly not going to walk around with a big smile on my
face thinking everything is going great. Things aren't going great.
I have sleepless nights, yes I do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have all kinds of line combinations. I even put brown shoes
on today with a black suit and that's not me. I'm not frustrated,
far from being that. I'm encouraged and we have to keep on being
encouraged. We're trying our damndest to win and we have to keep on
going.''
</P>
<P>
   If things don't change, it will be black shoes with a brown suit
next.

KAFELNIKOV RIGHT ON MONEY

 OPEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE _ If the day's rubles were stacked up they'd tower
alongside Australia's loftiest peak, Mt. Kosciusko. But rubles
don't figure in the life of Russian tennis player Yevgeny
Kafelnikov any more. He deals in dollars now _ $434,000 of them for
beating a Swede, Thomas Enqvist, Sunday to take the Australian Open
title _ and, more importantly, the restoration of his devalued
pride.
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov's once-brilliant career, reaching an early pinnacle
three years ago as he won the French singles and doubles (a rare
duet) at 22, was beginning to resemble the Russian economy. He was
making boo-boos, losing to who's-whos, and gaining only a
reputation as very uncooperative.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's over. He's turned around. Yevgeny's a stubborn Russian
nut and I'm a crazy Ukrainian nut,'' Larry Stefanki, standing in a
hallway at Melbourne Park, raved after his guy's 4-6, 6-0, 6-4, 7-6
(7-1), title triumph. ``That's why we understand each other. Our
goal now: No. 1. Yevgeny can match Pete Sampras in everything but
the serve, and that will come.''
</P>
<P>
   If the champ's new coach, Stefanki, out of LaQuinta, Calif., and
before that Stanford, sounds like a fast-talking fight manager,
maybe that's what the prodigal, Kafelnikov, needed. Stefanki, a
decent player on the tour more than a decade ago, seems to
specialize in hard-rock cases. The last was surly Marcelo Rios,
with whom Stefanki served two terms. San Quentin might have been
easier time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fired myself the first time. It was just too tough,''
Stefanki said with a smile. ``His father begged me to try again.''
The second time around Stefanki tutored Rios _ the eighth dwarf,
Grumpy Jr. _ to the Australian final just a year ago, and No. 1 for
a brief stretch last spring. Then the grateful Rios fired him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marcelo said he wanted to go in another direction. Where do
you go from No. 1?'' Stefanki said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   But No. 1 remains the pedagogical aspiration for Stefanki. It
was reignited when, back home, he got a phone call from Kafelnikov,
an uninspired loser to an anonymous Swede at the US Open. The
caller made an offer for one of the best examples of detente since
Gorbachev was around. The Russian wanted an American coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was working with Jonas Bjorkman, as nice a guy as you can
find. It's great when you're in demand. I had to choose between
Bjorkman and the crazy Russian, but I thought Yevgeny could go all
the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm just one reason. The main one is probably his marriage
to Mascha last July, and their two kids, one a stepchild, the other
their new baby. That gives you a different look at things. But I
think I've got him thinking about what he can do in the next three
years, the window of opportunity, the Hall of Fame, maybe a Davis
Cup for Russia with that good kid, Marat Safin.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many guys have won on clay in Paris and a hard court like
here? Sampras hasn't. Rios couldn't handle the final a year ago (a
6-2, 6-2, 6-2, stomping by Petr Korda). I told Yevgeny just to slow
down, stay calm, and enjoy the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did,'' said Kafelnikov from behind a rusty, scraggly beard
that he vowed ``to shave off after I won, like Bjorn Borg used to
do. You don't get many chances like this, and you have to be able
to focus for a couple of hours, concentrate basically on this one
match. Marriage was a turning point for me. Other things, too, like
Larry, just to relieve the pressure in my head. I'm more flexible,
happier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I could jump over the China wall with no
difficulties.'' Well, he did jump seven flights, from No. 10 to No.
3, right behind Sampras and Alex Corretja, while Rios _ a no-show
with a gimpy back _ has descended from No. 2 to No. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``One for two ain't bad,'' Stefanki said of his family's
almost-double, the Aussie and the football game in Miami involving
his brother-in-law, Atlanta QB Chris Chandler. Larry, married to
Diane Chandler's sister, Kelly, is a regular golfing partner with
Chandler and an earlier QB, father-in-law John Brodie, the
ex-Niner.
</P>
<P>
   Stefanki took Rios to a different sort of court to recover
agreed-upon wages. Did he get his money? ``No. Kelly, my wife, said
let's forget about it. We don't want anything from that guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he said with a grin, ``I hope Marcelo was watching the
TV, watching Yevgeny win.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Stefanki should open a reform school if he gets tired of
tennis.

BRONCOS GOOD, BUT DYNASTY TALK TOO MUCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _Within certain Rocky Mountain precincts loud voices will
be heard proclaiming dynasty status for the Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Excuse the prolonged yawn from Mr. and Mrs. America and all
ships at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Credit, please, where it's due, and now with back-to-back world
championships, the Broncos deserve ringing applause for emerging as
the best team in the NFL salary cap-free agency era. Which, in no
way, is to be compared with what the Cowboys or 49ers accomplished
earlier this decade.
</P>
<P>
   And for the most glaring example of these Broncos being both
separate and not equal to the way-it-was in the NFL throne room,
there's the old Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   But as Super Bowls go, the 33rd edition here yesterday did have
a familiar storyline from yesteryear. There was much more blooper
than super for one participant, that being the Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Dirty Bird was not a dance. It was messy offensive football that
soured the sweetest NFL story of this season. And with deep regret
for anyone living within a hundred miles of Texas Stadium, where
Dan Reeves remains loved by the populace, a 34-19 win for Denver
continued his bitter Super Bowl coaching legacy.
</P>
<P>
   John Elway can retire a double, back-to-back, Super Bowl winner.
If Elway so chooses to retire, that is. But his least-favorite
former coach, Mr. Reeves, continues to live in Super Bowl hell.
</P>
<P>
   Dan is now 0-for-4 in these things, three of them losses with
Elway in Denver. In those four games, Reeves' teams have been
outscored, 170-59. Yikes.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, there was the pregame humiliation for Reeves and
the Falcons, when 21 hours before kickoff, safety Eugene Robinson
was street-busted by the Miami police for seeking certain sexual
favors from what turned out to be an undercover female officer.
</P>
<P>
   Who the heck does Eugene think he is _ the president?
</P>
<P>
   But when the game kicked off, it was Chris Chandler and the
Atlanta offense that should have been arrested. And actually, jail
time was served in the defensive lockup of the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   How strange. Denver won this one with defense. Elway was voted
the MVP by a media panel that must have had its collective head in
the press-box sack lunch when the ballots were marked.
</P>
<P>
   Elway, by the way, was great, particularly since he lost
favorite target Shannon Sharpe to a knee injury on the ninth play.
But the game itself was turned early, and then often, by 11 guys on
defense. Any of them (Darrien Gordon? Bill Romanowski?) coulda and
shoulda been voted MVP, except when you play defense for the
Broncos, it's like being the second-highest mountain in Colorado.
Nobody cares.
</P>
<P>
   For obvious reasons, most of them involving a strong dislike for
each other, much of the pregame whisper last week was about the
Reeves-Mike Shanahan ``thing.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the MVC (Most Valuable Coach) of this Super
Bowl was Broncos defensive coordinator Greg Robinson, reportedly
not a favorite staff member of Shanahan's. But in crunch time _
meaning every time the Falcons threatened, which seemed like always
_ Robinson had his people in the right place. And his people
repeatedly made huge plays, most of them by blitzing, which spooked
Chandler while also keeping Jamal Anderson in check.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the first half, the heart had been yanked out of
the Falcons due to the following:
</P>
<P>
   A first down at the Denver 10, but held to a field goal. Stuffed
on a third-and-one from their own 36, then on a third-and-one from
the Denver 26, which was followed by a fourth-and-one attempt by
Anderson that lost yardage. Reeves gambled in the right spot, but
it didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta killer came next. The Falcons had two shots from
inside the Denver 10, did nothing, and then the impossible
happened. Morten Andersen missed on a 26-yard field-goal attempt,
leaving Denver with a 10-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It would get worse. On the Broncos' first play after Andersen's
goof, Elway got speedy receiver Rod Smith deep on Eugene Robinson.
That one went 80 yards for a 17-3 lead, and the lights went out in
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson had as much chance against Smith as he did against the
Miami vice squad. But it was also flawed zone coverage that would
leave a safety deep on Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta even came back from that, drove to the Denver 10, yet
again came away with only a field goal. The Falcons' halftime
dressing room was a disaster area for mental health.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler had emerged as a quarterbacking Cinderfellow in this
NFL season, but pumpkin-time came in the second half. The first
three Atlanta possessions _ three interceptions. Lordy.
</P>
<P>
   Recount those MVP votes. And in Colorado, put Greg Robinson in
charge of that Jon Benet Ramsey case. Robinson certainly solved the
mystery of Chris Chandler and the Dan Reeves' offense, which had
confused many this season.
</P>
<P>
   But about the dynasty stuff _ don't get carried away, OK?

BATTIE, CELTICS LOOK LIKE NICE FIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM _ As he waited for the NBA lockout to run its course,
Tony Battie did a little running of his own in Los Angeles, where
his daily workout partners included the Celtics' Paul Pierce and
Kenny Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was playing with two of my teammates but I didn't know it
then,'' said Battie. ``With the lockout going on, I didn't know I
was being shopped and I definitely didn't know that (Rick) Pitino
was interested. I'm sure glad he came and rescued me.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Battie, an ex-Nugget, was soon to become an ex-Laker
when the Celtics dealt Travis Knight back to Los Angeles Jan. 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being with Boston is the perfect system for me, especially
being a little under weight as a forward playing center,'' said the
6-foot-11-inch, 240-pound Battie, who left Texas Tech after his
junior year and was drafted fifth overall by Denver before the
1997-98 season. ``The running and trapping game is kind of my
forte, with my long arms, my reach, and the up-and-down the floor _
it all fits me perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets, for whom he averaged nearly 24 minutes, 8.4 points,
4.5 rebounds, and 1.06 blocks per game, traded him to the Lakers
last June for guard Nick Van Exel and Battie fully expected to be
wearing a Laker uniform this season. Instead, he's living in a
hotel, waiting for his belongings to be shipped east.
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't mind the wait _ especially after being dubbed
``El Busto'' by Nuggets general manager Dan Issel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good change of scenery. Boston's a better place to
play, especially because of the fan base and the team's great
history that you have to come in every day and live up to. We have
a lot of work to do before we can be mentioned in the same sentence
with a lot of guys who wore the Celtics jerseys before us,'' said
Battie, who had 11 points and six rebounds against the Raptors in
an exhibition game Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Battie may have had some tough times in Denver, but last Feb. 10
against the Celtics wasn't one of them. ``I nearly had a
triple-double,'' Battie recalled of his 10-point, 13-rebound,
8-block performance.
</P>
<P>
   Celtics general manager Chris Wallace saw Battie play in college
``about eight times. We also worked him out in Philadelphia. We
liked him a great deal. He was our second choice behind Ron Mercer.
If Mercer had been taken prior to the sixth pick, we would have
taken Tony.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very athletic and runs the court extremely well for his
size. He can block shots and rebound and he's also shown the
ability to face the basket and shoot with some range from 10 to 12
feet. He showed that in the exhibition game the other night when he
made some face-up jumpers.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace also has seen in Battie an ability to get the ball in
the post with his back to the basket, turn around, and get his shot
off unhindered. ``There are very few people who are going to step
up and block his shot and that's a great attribute to have because
you don't really have to force anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All of the above is what Wallace was hoping he was getting in
return for Knight, but there's more.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do all the scouting before the draft, but you don't
know until you get a guy in for practice and games and seeing him
interact with the players and coaches what he brings to your team.
It's almost like moving into a new house and getting used to it,''
said Wallace, ``and from what we've seen, he's been a jewel so far.
He's very eager to learn, wants to be in Boston, and wants to play
for Rick Pitino. And I think we have him at a time in his career
where he's very highly motivated and hungry to make amends for a
disappointing rookie season.''
</P>
<P>
   Battie called his tenure in Denver ``totally a learning process.
In the long run, it was good to get that year under my belt. But it
was a terrible season in other ways. I think it taught me some
mental toughness.''
</P>
<P>
   Battie said that when the Nuggets took the floor last year, ``we
were playing for the wrong goals. We were playing not to be the
worst team in league history.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he is ready to play wherever Pitino needs him and he
realizes that as a center with a forward's physique, ``I know I'll
need some help against some guys. I'm not going to match up body
for body against Shaq, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Center Dwayne Schintzius suffered a broken nose Saturday after
catching an errant elbow in practice. He will be operated on Monday
at New England Baptist Hospital and will be fitted with a
protective mask that he believes will enable him to play in
Friday's season opener. ``I'll be back soon,'' he said. ``I've come
too far to stop now. They'll have to break my leg to keep me out.''

TEXAS LEAVES UMASS AT A LOSS

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ They are headed south again, and Bruiser Flint
doesn't know what more he can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' said the University of Massachusetts coach, shaking his
head in dismay, ``it's not going to get any easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it gets any better for UMass depends on the Minutemen,
who once again played shorthanded Sunday at the Ervin Center
against the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, not literally. All the Minutemen showed up. But
figuratively?
</P>
<P>
   That's a different matter, and it was a contributing factor in a
76-65 loss to the Long-horns, their third in their last four games,
which dropped them back to two games under .500 (9-11).
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the right attitude, you can't win,'' said Flint. ``I
told them that before the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Minutemen seemed to have the right attitude. Guard
Monty Mack did what he could to carry the team on his shoulders by
pumping in a team-high 26 points. Center Lari Ketner had 16 points
and 11 rebounds, and guard Jonathan DePina contributed 7 points and
three assists in 19 minutes, a number that could increase
considerably in the Minutemen's next game, Thursday night at the
Mullins Center against Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Charlton Clarke? The senior captain and ostensible leader? He
scored 4 points in 21 minutes but spent the last 16 minutes sitting
on the bench. That was a huge development since the Minutemen made
run after run at the Longhorns (12-9), who are one of the hotter
teams in the Big 12, having won nine of their last 10, a streak
that has put them on top of the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even want to talk about that,'' said Flint when asked
about Clarke's role. ``I'm still too upset.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if there were any more messages he could send to
Clarke, who is just the latest Minuteman to lose his focus, Flint
shook his head. ``It's been 20 games,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone looking for encouragement could look at Mack, who has
become the floor leader of this not-so-merry band of Minutemen.
During the first half, in which the Longhorns _ particularly 7-foot
sophomore center Chris Mihm (20 points, 17 rebounds) _ pushed the
Minutemen around, it was a Mack scoring surge of 9 points (all on
3-point shots) in less than a minute that pulled the Minutemen from
14 down to within 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made their runs, we had our runs too,'' said Mack, who,
like the rest of the Minutemen, couldn't sustain the effort.
``They're very athletic and they get the ball off quick.''
</P>
<P>
   UMass couldn't make a sustained run in the second half. Trailing
by 9 at halftime, the closest it got in the second half was 7, with
the Longhorns up, 70-63, with 1:25 left. But without Clarke, and
with Mihm winning his battle underneath against Ketner, the
Minutemen had no extra firepower available.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is a far cry from the disjointed group that Rick Barnes
inherited this season after replacing Tom Penders.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly and steadily, Barnes, whose previous stops at Providence
and Clemson produced NCAA Tournament teams, has gotten the
Longhorns to play his style, his way, most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Barnes and Flint talked with each other. ``He told
me his team had a terrible attitude when the season started and
they lost eight of their first 11 games,'' said Flint, walking down
a corridor in the Ervin Center after the game. ``But they turned it
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Flint was asked if he could expect the same from his team.
``We're still 5-3 in the Atlantic 10 and we've got a stretch of
(three) home games,'' said Flint, who without a serious stretch
run, looks like the coach of an NIT team at best. ``We've still got
time.''
</P>
<P>
   A few more losses, a few more no-shows, and that timeline will
shrink even more.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ There was plenty of Denver defense and a gracious dose
of Terrell Davis running. Big-play interceptions abounded for
Denver, and cornerback Darrien Gordon returned two for a Super Bowl
record 108 yards. There were fancy Rod Smith catches, surprising
Howard Griffith scoring runs.
</P>
<P>
   There had been enough tough football through three quarters of
Super Bowl XXXIII that, with the Denver Broncos leading the Atlanta
Falcons by only 17-6, it seemed as if the teams could finish with
flair, offer a little drama.
</P>
<P>
   But there was too much Denver left. And so much John Elway. The
champions had not finished. They wanted more. They took it.
</P>
<P>
   Denver defeated Atlanta, 34-19, on Sunday night before 74,803
fans at Pro Player Stadium to win its second consecutive Super Bowl
championship. It was also the second-straight victory by an
American Football Conference team, after 13 straight National
Conference victories.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos scored 17 points in the game's first half and then
17 more in the fourth quarter alone. A sprint to the finish gave
the Broncos another sterling silver Vince Lombardi Trophy to
relish.
</P>
<P>
   A memorable moment for Elway, the Bronco quarterback. He was
expected to retire now, though he refused to say after the game.
Through his first 14 seasons he labored and longed for a
championship ring, and now in his last two seasons he has two
glowing rings. At age 38 Elway can leave having saved his best for
last, his best Super Bowl by far in five appearances _ completing
18 of 29 passes for 336 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception.
Those numbers _ which included the third-highest passing yardage in
Super Bowl history _ earned Elway the game's most valuable player
award.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Smith's 152 receiving yards on 5 catches, and Davis'
102 rushing yards on 25 carries, they helped give Denver a
remarkable 17-2 season that began with 13 consecutive victories and
ended with the Broncos, once again, as kings. Denver becomes only
the sixth team to win consecutive Super Bowl titles; the Pittsburgh
Steelers did it twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They take their chances and blitz a bit, but that is not their
style of defense,'' Elway said of the Falcons, who failed to sack
him. ``They sit back and defend, so we weren't surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just thrilled that we won. I'm thrilled to be a part of
this team. This is what we play for, and to have this opportunity
two years in a row is unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway soundly outplayed Chris Chandler, the Atlanta quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler was 19 of 35 for 219 yards, with 1 touchdown and 3
interceptions. It was the interceptions in the third quarter that
hurt Atlanta most, especially the second one. It came with Atlanta
at the Denver 21 and looking to cut into a 17-6 Denver lead. But
Gordon swiped Chandler's pass, which had been tipped, and returned
it 58 yards to the Atlanta 24.
</P>
<P>
   Denver would take the ball and continue a drive early into the
fourth quarter that would result in a 1-yard touchdown run by
Griffith. That made it 24-6, and the Falcons would not recover.
Denver piled on more points _ an Elway dive for a touchdown with 11
minutes 20 seconds remaining that made it 31-6. Exclamation point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad,'' Chandler said. ``I just want to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta rookie Tim Dwight returned a kickoff 94 yards for a
touchdown with 11:01 remaining, and the Terance Mathis caught a
3-yard scoring pass for the Falcons with 5:04 remaining, to make
the score closer.
</P>
<P>
   It was a wondrous season for Atlanta and its coach, Dan Reeves,
which finished with a crashing thud.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a case of seizing the moment, and we just didn't
seize it,'' said the Atlanta linebacker Jessie Tuggle, who watched
his offense commit four turnovers and was disappointed when the
defense could only force one. ``Confidence. They played with
confidence, and took the fire out of our offense, and took the fire
out of our team. We are used to setting the tempo, and we did that
all year long by getting turnovers. They got the turnovers. They
put us in a position in this game where we were trying to play
catch-up and trying our best not to make things worse. They made it
where we couldn't play our normal game.''
</P>
<P>
   It was another spirited, focused and fulfilling season for
Denver, which finished what it had started, dominating the Falcons
in much the manner it has dominated the National Football League
for two straight seasons, with a sparkling overall record of 33-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today our defense played like an offense,'' said Greg
Robinson, the Broncos' defensive coordinator. ``When we got the
interceptions, those were athletes making those plays and those
were athletes who took the ball and became offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said that Gordon's interception of Chandler completely
changed the game. ``We still had our chances in the third quarter,
and that was a huge interception,'' Reeves said. ``The ball was
tipped, Terance Mathis was wide open in the end zone, but they got
the interception. Our football team learned a heck of a lot being
here and hopefully can come back and they will know how to handle
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Shanahan, the Denver head coach, said: ``It was a great
performance by our defense. Any time your secondary is able to come
up with interceptions like they did, there is going to be a great
pass rush as well. So when you do that, which our defense has done
throughout the playoffs the last couple of years, they come up with
a number of big plays. They put pressure on the opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   So does the Denver offense, which ran 65 plays and averaged 7
yards a play.
</P>
<P>
   No points were scored in the third quarter because both teams
blew offensive chances, especially Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In the quarter, Elam missed attempts from 38 and 48 yards after
long Denver drives. But on long Atlanta drives, Chandler was
intercepted, once by Darrius Johnson and once by Gordon. To
Chandler's credit, he hustled and made the tackle, preventing
Gordon from returning the ball all the way for a score. No matter,
though.
</P>
<P>
   Denver would embark on a drive that would result in Griffith's
1-yard touchdown run 4 seconds into the fourth quarter.

</P>
<P>
   For most of the game, Denver's offense was the more efficient
one. The Broncos' first-half possessions went this way: touchdown,
interception, field goal, touchdown, punt. Add it up, and the total
was 17 Denver points. They came on a 1-yard run by Griffith with
3:55 left in the first quarter, on which the fullback bullied into
the end zone on a dive play; a 26-yard field goal by Elam, and,
with 4:54 left in the first half, a dramatic Elway-to-Smith 80-yard
pass on which Smith sprinted alone into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons, meanwhile, advanced to the Denver 15, 26, 8 and 11
in the game's first 30 minutes but managed only two field goals.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half Denver won in total yards (266 to 148) and in
passing yards (199 to 80) and in style, execution and production.
</P>
<P>
   It was Smith's 80-yard touchdown grab that, early on, was the
game's signature play.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta kicker Morten Anderson had just missed a 26-yard
field goal that would have cut Denver's lead to 10-6. Instead,
Denver got the ball at its own 20 and instantly made Atlanta pay.
</P>
<P>
   Smith lined up wide-right and ran past cornerback Ronnie
Bradford. That was fine for Atlanta. Bradford appeared to be in
zone coverage and that was his job, to cover Smith for the first 10
to 15 yards and then to release him to help behind. That help was
Robinson, who initially looked ready to pick up the coverage.
Robinson, however, was spun silly by Smith. Smith ran at Robinson
and showed an out move; Robinson reacted to the out and Smith then
ran inside, past Robinson. Robinson could not recover. Smith had a
two-step edge and Elway delivered the pass in stride. Touchdown.
Atlanta was behind by 14 points rather than 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept coming up with their safeties and it looked like we
could go up top,'' Smith said. ``John gave me a great ball and I
ran for the goal posts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons should have realized that it was critical that they
pay attention to the second quarter. Denver was not outscored in
any quarter this season. For Atlanta, there was one such quarter _
the second. During the regular season, the Falcons were outscored
by 95-91 in the second quarter. In the playoffs, they were
outscored by 23-14. Today, it was 10-3, including Smith's big play.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, however, scored first. It took the opening kickoff and
enjoyed Dwight's 21-yard return to the Atlanta 37. A 25-yard
pass-interference penalty on cornerback Ray Crockett, who was
holding the Atlanta receiver Tony Martin, put the ball at the
Denver 21. Atlanta drove to the Denver 8 and then went backward.
Chandler was sacked for a 7-yard loss on a double, middle blitz by
Gordon, a cornerback, and linebacker Bill Romanowski on which
Romanowski got there first. Anderson converted a 32-yard field goal
and with 9:35 left in the first quarter, Atlanta led by 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Denver took the ball on the kickoff and set the tone for the
game. Atlanta gained a field goal on its first drive. Denver would
score a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of tight end Shannon Sharpe catching passes
over the middle in the Denver drive that covered 80 yards in 10
plays and took 5:40. Smith, of course, was in the mix, too. Sharpe
made catches of 12 and 14 yards. In between, Smith made a grab of
41 yards on which Bradford missed a tackle that could have cut the
gain in half. Griffith finished the drive with his 1-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta ran three plays and punted on its next series, beginning
a disturbing first-half trend. On a third-and-1 play, it could not
convert a first-down run. That would happen later in the half on
another third-and-1 and even on a fourth-and-1. But after the first
time, Atlanta got a nice break. It punted and then Elway threw an
interception. The ball bounced off the hands of Sharpe and into
Bradford's hands at the Denver 35 with 1:27 left in the first
quarter. What followed? The possession on which Atlanta failed to
convert on third-and-1 and fourth-and-1, turning the ball right
back to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons suffered the same problems late as they had early:
unproductive offense. Interceptions returned by Denver for long
gains. A committed Denver team intent on making its mark in pro
football history.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first Super Bowl and the first one for this organization
will always be sweetest for me,'' said Steve Atwater, the Broncos'
veteran safety. ``It was the first one for the AFC in a long time.
It meant so much to the people of Denver. But this second one is
pretty close. What a nice problem to have. We've got a couple now
that we can choose from.'' &QL;

 CLASSIC-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ An Irishwoman was favored to win the featured race, the
3,000 meters, in Sunday's Terrier Classic. It just wasn't Marie
McMahon.
</P>
<P>
   After Olympian and four-time NCAA champion Sinead Delahunty
withdrew because of illness, though, the door was left open for
McMahon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hoped I would get second behind Sinead,'' McMahon said
after winning the race at the Boston University Armory in 9:11.69.
``I had no idea what to expect and I am just coming back from
injury, a broken toe which kept me out for eight weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   McMahon is accustomed to making the best of unpredictable
situations.
</P>
<P>
   She was raised in Ennistymon, County Clare, in the Republic of
Ireland, where umbrellas are more practical than track shoes. But
McMahon overcame the rain and sleet to establish herself as a
world-class distance runner. She followed Delahunty's trail to
Providence College to run under the direction of Ray Treacy and is
now living in Boston preparing for the Irish national cross-country
championships and the World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wet and damp in Ireland, more so than here, and there is
only one indoor track,'' McMahon said. ``I have to go 2 1/2 or
three hours from my home to train indoors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy training here. The winters are a bit tough here, but
there are facilities and there are so many top athletes. You can
just jump into a race like this with some very good runners. And,
with this weather, you won't burn out training by the time summer
gets here.''
</P>
<P>
   McMahon is focusing on the national championships in Donegal
Feb. 24, then the World Championships in Belfast. She finished 23d
two years ago in the World Championships in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   She increased the pace after a slow start to finish ahead of
Maribel Sanchez of the Central Massachusetts Striders in 9:14.22;
BU women's coach Lesley Lehane, who holds the track record of 8:44,
in 9:14.79; and Larissa Kleinmann, a BU student from Stuttgart,
Germany, in 9:16.66.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to go out too hard, but with 10 laps to go, I
felt good, so I thought I would give it a good shot,'' McMahon
said.
</P>
<P>
   In other races:
</P>
<P>
   -- Kate Vermeulen, a West Virginia freshman, upset Kathy Fleming
of New Balance in winning the mile in 4:47;
</P>
<P>
   -- Kim Voyticky, a Duke student competing unattached, won the
800 in 2:07.80, ahead of Claudine Williams of LSU in 2:07.87;
</P>
<P>
   -- Rosemary Ryan, an Irish junior national team member, won the
5,000 in 15:55.92. Ryan, formerly of BU and competing for the BAA,
was far off the meet record of 15:17, set by Sonia O'Sullivan in
1991.

BATTIE, CELTICS LOOK LIKE NICE FIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM _ As he waited for the NBA lockout to run its course,
Tony Battie did a little running of his own in Los Angeles, where
his daily workout partners included the Celtics' Paul Pierce and
Kenny Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was playing with two of my teammates but I didn't know it
then,'' said Battie. ``With the lockout going on, I didn't know I
was being shopped and I definitely didn't know that (Rick) Pitino
was interested. I'm sure glad he came and rescued me.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Battie, an ex-Nugget, was soon to become an ex-Laker
when the Celtics dealt Travis Knight back to Los Angeles Jan. 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being with Boston is the perfect system for me, especially
being a little under weight as a forward playing center,'' said the
6-foot-11-inch, 240-pound Battie, who left Texas Tech after his
junior year and was drafted fifth overall by Denver before the
1997-98 season. ``The running and trapping game is kind of my
forte, with my long arms, my reach, and the up-and-down the floor _
it all fits me perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets, for whom he averaged nearly 24 minutes, 8.4 points,
4.5 rebounds, and 1.06 blocks per game, traded him to the Lakers
last June for guard Nick Van Exel and Battie fully expected to be
wearing a Laker uniform this season. Instead, he's living in a
hotel, waiting for his belongings to be shipped east.
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't mind the wait _ especially after being dubbed
``El Busto'' by Nuggets general manager Dan Issel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good change of scenery. Boston's a better place to
play, especially because of the fan base and the team's great
history that you have to come in every day and live up to. We have
a lot of work to do before we can be mentioned in the same sentence
with a lot of guys who wore the Celtics jerseys before us,'' said
Battie, who had 11 points and six rebounds against the Raptors in
an exhibition game Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Battie may have had some tough times in Denver, but last Feb. 10
against the Celtics wasn't one of them. ``I nearly had a
triple-double,'' Battie recalled of his 10-point, 13-rebound,
8-block performance.
</P>
<P>
   Celtics general manager Chris Wallace saw Battie play in college
``about eight times. We also worked him out in Philadelphia. We
liked him a great deal. He was our second choice behind Ron Mercer.
If Mercer had been taken prior to the sixth pick, we would have
taken Tony.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very athletic and runs the court extremely well for his
size. He can block shots and rebound and he's also shown the
ability to face the basket and shoot with some range from 10 to 12
feet. He showed that in the exhibition game the other night when he
made some face-up jumpers.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace also has seen in Battie an ability to get the ball in
the post with his back to the basket, turn around, and get his shot
off unhindered. ``There are very few people who are going to step
up and block his shot and that's a great attribute to have because
you don't really have to force anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All of the above is what Wallace was hoping he was getting in
return for Knight, but there's more.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do all the scouting before the draft, but you don't
know until you get a guy in for practice and games and seeing him
interact with the players and coaches what he brings to your team.
It's almost like moving into a new house and getting used to it,''
said Wallace, ``and from what we've seen, he's been a jewel so far.
He's very eager to learn, wants to be in Boston, and wants to play
for Rick Pitino. And I think we have him at a time in his career
where he's very highly motivated and hungry to make amends for a
disappointing rookie season.''
</P>
<P>
   Battie called his tenure in Denver ``totally a learning process.
In the long run, it was good to get that year under my belt. But it
was a terrible season in other ways. I think it taught me some
mental toughness.''
</P>
<P>
   Battie said that when the Nuggets took the floor last year, ``we
were playing for the wrong goals. We were playing not to be the
worst team in league history.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he is ready to play wherever Pitino needs him and he
realizes that as a center with a forward's physique, ``I know I'll
need some help against some guys. I'm not going to match up body
for body against Shaq, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Center Dwayne Schintzius suffered a broken nose Saturday after
catching an errant elbow in practice. He will be operated on Monday
at New England Baptist Hospital and will be fitted with a
protective mask that he believes will enable him to play in
Friday's season opener. ``I'll be back soon,'' he said. ``I've come
too far to stop now. They'll have to break my leg to keep me out.''

BRONCOS REPEAT AS SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ If John Elway wants to go out on top, the record-setting
quarterback of the Denver Broncos should announce his retirement
today when he picks up his MVP trophy for Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   There were many heroes Sunday night as the Broncos defended
their world championship with a convincing 34-19 dismantling of the
Atlanta Falcons at Pro Players Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Davis, the regular-season MVP and 2,000-yard rusher, put
together his playoff-record seventh straight 100-yard game.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos' defense kept the Falcons' offense out of the end
zone until the closing minutes of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Darrien Gordon intercepted a pair of Chris Chandler
passes, returning them 58 and 50 yards to set up second-half
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom-used fullback Howard Griffith ran for two TDs, matching
his career total.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Smith caught five passes for 152 yards, including an 80-yard
TD pass from Elway that proved to be the play of the game.
</P>
<P>
   But the 38-year-old Elway was the best part of the Broncos'
methodical march to another Super Bowl victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just thrilled to death that we won,'' Elway said. ``I'm
just thrilled to death to be part of this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I came back for,'' said Elway, who thought long
and hard about retiring after winning his first Super Bowl last
year. ``This is what I've been working nine months for.''
</P>
<P>
   But will the heart and soul of the Broncos return for a chance
at an unprecedented three-peat? Five other teams have won
back-to-back Super Bowls _ the Green Bay Packers (1967-68), Miami
Dolphins (1973-74), Pittsburgh Steelers (1975-76 and 1979-80), San
Francisco 49ers (1989-90) and Dallas Cowboys (1993-94). But no one
has ever made it three straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even going to talk about that,'' Elway said when the
first question asked was about his future. ``I'm just going to
enjoy this and cross that bridge when I come to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway has had a storybook 16-year career, but as far as Super
Bowls go, Sunday night was his finest hour _ actually 3 hours, 18
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   After completing just 45 percent of his passes in the Broncos'
three Super Bowl losses and passing for only 123 yards in last
year's upset of the defending champion Green Bay Packers, Elway
was, well, Elway.
</P>
<P>
   He completed 18 of 29 passes for 336 yards, passed for one TD
and ran for another. Elway did have a pass intercepted, but only
because it went off the hands of tight end Shannon Sharpe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it is John's last game, but I think there is a
good chance it could be,'' Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said. ``And
if you are going to go out, what a way to go out.''
</P>
<P>
   In a game that was expected to be a duel between Davis and the
Falcons' Jamal Anderson, it came down to Elway's ability to make
plays and Chandler's failure to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, the Falcons had first downs at the Broncos'
10-, 35-, 15- and 16-yard lines, but were able to score only six
points. They lost the ball on downs once when Anderson was stopped
for a 2-yard loss on a curious pitch play on fourth-and-one. On the
other occasion, Morten Andersen, the hero of the Falcons' overtime
win over the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC title game, missed a
26-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, the Falcons drove to the Broncos' 21 and 26
on their first two possessions, only to have one Chandler pass end
up in the hands of Broncos nickel back Darrius Johnson and another
be tipped by defensive tackle Keith Traylor and intercepted by
Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``To try to explain what happened would sound like excuses,''
said Chandler, the former Everett High School and University of
Washington quarterback who was intercepted three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``And to do that to you guys,'' he added of the reporters
crowded around him after the game, ``is not important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta cornerback Ray Buchanan, who had guaranteed a Falcons
victory, was more direct and honest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't win a game when you make as many turnovers as we
did,'' he said. ``That's not like us. But that was us today. We
didn't play how we were supposed to, how we're capable of playing
or how we have been playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons had become the trendy pick to deny the Broncos and
Elway a second Super Bowl victory after storming through the
regular season 14-2 and upsetting the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   But that was underestimating Elway, and the things he continues
to be able to do.
</P>
<P>
   There has been talk the past two seasons about how the Broncos
had become Davis' team, and with good reason. But that was
downright disrespectful to Elway.
</P>
<P>
   He was anticipating being the one who would have to win the
game, and was ready for the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that the whole week with all the talk about the
running games,'' Elway said of his role as difference-maker. ``We
knew we had to stop Jamal Anderson. They knew they had to stop
Terrell. A good defense can stop a good running back if they commit
enough players to doing it. So I knew I was going to have to make
some plays.''
</P>
<P>
   None was bigger than the 80-yard TD pass to Smith.
</P>
<P>
   It came with the Broncos nursing a 10-3 lead. It came on the
next play after Andersen had hooked his 26-yarder wide right. It
came when the Broncos most needed it.
</P>
<P>
   Elway set up the pass with a play-action fake to Davis and
bought Smith time to get open behind Falcons free safety Eugene
Robinson by rolling to his right. Then, Elway was suddenly a kid
again, rifling the ball to Smith, who caught the pass at the
Atlanta 42-yard line and outran Robinson to the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd run that play to Terrell before and I saw Eugene bite on
it,'' Elway said. ``So I knew if we could set it up just right, Rod
could get behind him. It turned out to be a pretty big play.''
</P>
<P>
   In a pretty big game, one that could have been the last in
Elway's big-play career.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans in the crowd of 74,803 voiced their opinion on the
subject as Elway trotted off the field by holding up a huge banner
that read _ no, pleaded _ ``John, one more year. Please.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe, the babbling Bronco, later seconded that emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old man still has that gift left in him,'' Sharpe said.
``He is going to sit down and talk about what he is going to do,
but we would love to have him back for another year.''

ELWAY STEALS GOOD ENDING FROM REEVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Poor Dan Reeves. His renewed health sustains him. His
Super Bowl fate haunts him.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that, after two weeks of scraping open the wounds on
their bitter parting, the Denver Broncos had the final word on
their old coach yesterday in Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   Two words, to be accurate _ John and Elway.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of Reeves, the recovering heart patient, absorbing a
fourth Super Bowl defeat _ and this time at the hands of his former
team _ smacks of a Greek tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   But John Elway always could steal a good show.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing for 336 yards and engineering as precise a game as any
quarterback in Super Bowl history, Elway again soared to the top of
the football world yesterday. The Broncos' 34-19 dismantling of the
mishap-prone Atlanta Falcons left no doubt of who has been the best
team in pro football for these past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal was winning a world championship at the start of the
season,'' Denver coach Mike Shanahan said. ``We had a little
adversity. But we kept our focus.''
</P>
<P>
   His synopsis rang with understatement. The Broncos went a
razor-focused 17-and-2. They won their first 13 games. They scythed
through three playoff foes by a combined 63 points.
</P>
<P>
   Next time that you hear a team, any team, whine about how hard
it is to repeat as a champion, remind them of Elway and the 1998
Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Reeves. Again, like a Greek tragedy, he was done in by a
deadly mix of conspirators.
</P>
<P>
   His quarterback, for one thing. Chris Chandler's first night
under the Super Bowl big top produced a comedy of pratfalls. He
threw three interceptions. On seven of the Falcons' first eight
true possessions, they marched into Denver territory, only to leave
with only two field goals.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a turning point in Chandler's night, it came on
Atlanta's opening drive. The Falcons had whisked 55 yards to the
Denver 8-yard line. But on third down, linebacker Bill Romanowski
blitzed up the middle and crunched Chandler for a 7-yard loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``They go in there and get seven and it's a real
momentum-builder for them,'' defensive coordinator Greg Robinson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The very-Dirty Birds had to settle for a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   And so the day went. On the grand scale of Super Bowl history,
Chandler likely will be judged as bad as Elway was good.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves' defense _ safety Eugene Robinson, in particular _ didn't
help, either.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was arrested Saturday night and charged with trying to
solicit the sexual services of an undercover vice officer. So much
for the Falcons' razor-sharp focus. Robinson was scorched for the
Broncos' second touchdown, an 80-yard Elway bomb to Rod Smith.
</P>
<P>
   On Denver's first 10 possessions, the only ones that really
mattered, the Atlanta defense forced the Broncos to punt only once.
Billed as being tough against the run, the Broncos' redoubtable
Terrell Davis ran and ran. He finished with 102 yards on 25
carries.
</P>
<P>
   Elway and the Broncos even lost the services of Pro Bowl tight
end Shannon Sharpe, who suffered a game-ending knee injury. It
didn't matter. Losing one target, Elway found another.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played great,'' Sharpe said of Elway. ``The old man still
has the gift left in him.''
</P>
<P>
   And to think that people doubted. The Falcons' dramatic NFC
title game _ a triumph engineered by Chandler _ had won them
converts. There were bold suggestions, wasting valuable newsprint,
that tried to argue that Atlanta would have the edge for this game
in quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, puh-leese.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Ed McCaffrey, who caught five Elway passes in the
second half, assessed his quarterback's performance as
``unbelievable. I mean, John Elway is the Denver Broncos. He is
Denver. And he proved that today.''
</P>
<P>
   If, as some have suggested, Elway's skills are diminishing, then
maybe it's time for a new standard of skills to be written. OK, he
can't scramble like he used to. But Elway apparently still can see
what's happening in the secondary as well as anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that speaks for itself _ him being named most valuable
player,'' Shanahan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to go out, what a way to go out.''
</P>
<P>
   What a way, indeed. Elway, however, still juked and stiff-armed
all postgame queries about his NFL future. There are seriously
strong feelings amongst the Broncos that last night was his final
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all hope he stays,'' McCaffrey said, ``and we'll all be
nudging him to stick with it. But the guy has done everything you
can do in football. He is one of the greatest players to ever play
the game, and I am privileged to have played with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Reeves, Elway had been a three-time Super Bowl loser. His
legacy _ and his inevitable Hall of Fame plaque _ will now show
that he has won two in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations to the Denver Broncos. What a great football
team,'' a gracious Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   In a normal script, Reeves, the sentimental favorite, would have
been the conquering hero.
</P>
<P>
   But John Elway always could steal a show.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
JUAN Antonio Samaranch, the dirtiest of old birds, should have been
watching the Super Bowl on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he probably was. The Big Game had all the ingredients
that Samaranch's Big Games have thrived upon for decades now.
</P>
<P>
   Rampant commercialism. Lavishness. Star power as far as the eye
can see. Glitter and glamour. And sponsors, sponsors, sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, compared to the Olympic Games empire that surrounds
His Excellency _ which, by the way, Samaranch demands to be called
in International Olympic Committee documents and by underlings _
the Super Bowl is just a quaint little event.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Sunday pickup game compared to Samaranch's prime 16
Days of Glory. It's the nice little appetizer to Samaranch's feast.
</P>
<P>
   But how much more crumbling must the empire endure before it
strikes back, or worse, its sponsors revolt and the empire falls
apart around Samaranch chip by chip?
</P>
<P>
   The latest revelations in the bribes-for-votes scandal that has
rocked the hallowed walls of IOC headquarters in Lausanne,
Switzerland, literally have no borders. What began with disturbing
news that the pristine Salt Lake City corrupted itself and the
Games with bribes for votes now has expanded to include Sydney,
Australia; Nagano, Japan; Seoul, South Korea; and failed bid
attempts in Toronto and Manchester, England.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all these bombshells, Samaranch only has continued to
sit in his richly decorated Swiss bunker and done little more than
harrumph between manicures.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC president has promised investigations but delivered
little. When Dick Pound, the Canadian IOC board member leading the
investigation, told Samaranch of a $1 million offer made by Toronto
organizers hoping to manipulate the vote for the 1988 Games,
Samaranch did not investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, when similar charges were made in a book by a British
journalist, Samaranch sued the publisher for libel instead of
investigating in hopes of finding the truth.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of at least 12 corrupt IOC voters becoming entangled
in the scandal, Samaranch has said he believes everything necessary
already has been done. He has refused to look deeper and
investigate more IOC voters.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he hired an international public-relations firm and
told it to clean up the Olympic image. Part of the PR plan has been
never to call the cash payments, free housing, scholarships, jobs
and alleged prostitution ``bribes.'' In every document, every news
conference, Samaranch refers to them only as ``benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   When news of a decadent $2 million party by IOC bid cities in
1985 was revealed, Samaranch called such extravagance normal. When
Samaranch was implicated, admitting he has accepted gifts from
numerous bid cities, he claimed he should not be condemned for the
practice since he does not have a vote unless a ballot ends in a
tie.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, he says he is above the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch has called for reform in how future bid cities will be
named, but as is the case with the IOC membership itself, Samaranch
plans to personally name the proposed 15-member committee.
</P>
<P>
   How will this change the corruption? How will it keep the
scandal from growing?
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch has boasted of personally appointing more than half
the IOC membership, which also re-elects its president _ Samaranch
_ every time his term expires. Thus, every vote of every Games bid
is done by Samaranch's people, who answer to Samaranch and owe him
for their statesman-like lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has fazed Samaranch about this dastardly scandal. His
Excellency has done nothing but prove he would just as well let
critics eat cake.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps those who know the change should begin with
Samaranch have one hope.
</P>
<P>
   Would you like a Coca-Cola with your cake? Would you support the
official soft drink of the tainted Games?
</P>
<P>
   What about Visa? Would you use the official card used to hire
call girls for IOC voters?
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, which is headquartered in Atlanta and was long
rumored to be the sole reason the Games landed there in 1996,
recently met with IOC investigators and demanded answers. United
Parcel Service, Xerox and Visa, each of which pays upward of $40
million for a four-year Olympic sponsorship, also have queried.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake Games might fold because there remains a $350
million sponsorship shortfall, and no one is knocking on the SLOC's
door anymore. In Australia, where the 2000 Summer Games will be
held, Caltex, a giant oil and gas sponsor, has pulled its $6.3
million Olympic sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   We can only hope Samaranch caught a glimpse of the lavishness we
saw on Super Sunday. The sponsors, sponsors, sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   They could be slipping through Samaranch's fingers, and when
they do, only then could Samaranch fade away, too. And the Games
will be glorious again.

HOW CAN ELWAY ABDICATE THRONE? 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ OK, John, you coming back?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even going to talk about that,'' said the Most
Valuable Player in Super Bowl XXXIII. ``Let me enjoy this. I'll
cross that bridge later on.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the answer you'd expect John Elway to give. But we had
to ask. Does he really think life will get any better than this?
His Denver Broncos had just beaten up on the Atlanta Falcons by
much worse than the 34-19 final score would indicate, and he had
waltzed off with the MVP prize. Was this not a Jordanesque
statement?
</P>
<P>
   It was a complete MVP performance from a sure first-ballot Hall
of Fame player. In last year's Super Bowl, Elway was a game
manager. He handed the ball off to Terrell Davis and he tried not
to make any mistakes. This year was an entirely different story. In
order for the Broncos to repeat as World Champions, John Elway had
to be, well, John Elway. His response was to go 18 for 29 for 336
yards and one touchdown. He also scored on a quarterback draw.
There was no question who was going to get the MVP award.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta talked all week about stopping the run,'' said Elway.
``They didn't say anything about the passing game. Anybody can stop
the run if they commit to it and want to do it badly enough. So I
was loooking forward to the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Make Elway beat us. That would have been an unthinkable concept
in years past, but by the time Super Bowl week had arrived it had
become a given that the Broncos' offense now belonged to league MVP
Terrell Davis, the 2,000-yard man, and that Elway was looking
increasingly mortal. The Broncos thought this was ridiculous. They
didn't say much about this publicly, but inside their closed little
world they were praying the Falcons would adopt that approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to stop Terrell,'' said backup tight end Byron
Chamberlain, ``then we've got a Hall of Fame quarterback, and he's
gonna kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Broncos believed, and that's what happened in
Pro Player Stadium Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   What Elway did was even more impressive than the numbers because
he was forced to play the final three quarters of the game without
one of his primary offensive weapons. Shannon Sharpe, the great
tight end, injured a knee while making a 14-yard catch-and-run in
the first period, and after testing his leg he was gone for the
game. Chamberlain did a tremendous job as his replacement, but no
one on earth is going to suggest that Byron Chamberlain ever could
replace a Shannon Sharpe, even-up.
</P>
<P>
   Elway was also forced to play some stretches without Davis, who
was in and out of the game during the second half. So it was just
like old times, and even older times, with John Elway the focal
point of the Denver offense.
</P>
<P>
   Being the proud guy that all legit superstars are, Elway even
used the occasion to defend his performance of a year ago (12 for
22, 123 yards). ``I wouldn't say I `struggled' last year,'' he said
in reference to one particular question. ``I did what I was asked
to do. We had the running game going, so I stuck with that. This
year they took away the running game _ or partially took away the
running game _ so I'm glad I could keep up my end of the bargain a
little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   This has got to be an exquisite feeling for Elway. He gave
serious thought last year to retiring after bagging his first
championship, and it would have been a dramatic statement had he
done so. There were, in fact, serious questions being raised about
his reliability. Many people thought he would be getting out just
ahead of the posse. To be standing in front of the assembled media,
many of whom had written at length about him being the second-best
quarterback in this game, had to be a powerful feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why I came back,'' he said. ``This is why I put in all
the work.''
</P>
<P>
   And work he does. Elway's biggest fans are inside that Denver
locker room. Asked last week what athletes he admires, Denver
offensive guard Mark Schlereth, he of the 22 surgical procedures
(with No. 23 scheduled for next week), said, ``I like the stars who
don't act like prima donnas when they have earned the right to be,
guys like John Elway. He earned the right long ago to skip drills
and get out of practices, and he never does.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it was John's last game,'' said coach Mike
Shanahan, ``but if it is, what a way to go out. But I can tell you
there are a lot of guys in that locker room trying to talk him into
trying for a three-peat.''
</P>
<P>
   A guy like Elway is fueled by the competition and by challenges
of every description. He knows very well that no quarterback in NFL
history has won three championships in a row.
</P>
<P>
   He'd certainly have a decent chance. Shanahan isn't going
anywhere. Davis isn't going anywhere. Sharpe isn't going anywhere.
Ed McCaffrey (five catches, 72 yards) isn't going anywhere.
Hard-hitting Bill Romanowski isn't going anywhere. It doesn't seem
to matter much who's on the offensive line, because it looks as if
the wily Alex Gibbs can fashion a unit out of anything you give
him. The core of talent will remain, and we now know that the
Broncos know how to deal with all the peripheral stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Elway is well aware he can't do all the things he used to do,
but his body is in good shape and he still has a lot of weapons at
his disposal. Bet that he'll be back.
</P>
<P>
   I'd even go so far as to say that he would consider quitting to
be a betrayal of sorts. Remember that he couldn't win one for 14
years, and that some of his most aggravating moments had come in
Super Bowls. He's going to quit now when he's found the winning
formula? That's not how guys like him usually think.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a romantic. I like the idea of John Elway quitting on top. I
would wager that Mike Shanahan has a different viewpoint. And I
think he'll be again be greeting No. 7 on the first day of training
camp.

ELWAY, BRONCOS REPEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ John Elway didn't just go out on top. He went over the
top.
</P>
<P>
   In what may well be his last game, Elway had his greatest Super
Bowl moment Sunday night at Pro Player Stadium, passing for 336
yards and a touchdown, running for another score, and leading his
Denver Broncos to their second straight Super Bowl victory. He was
named the game's Most Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos' 34-19 win ended the Atlanta Falcons' Cinderella
season with an avalanche of pass completions and two long nights of
bad news.
</P>
<P>
   The first had come at 9 p.m. Saturday night when safety Eugene
Robinson was arrested and charged with soliciting an undercover
police officer for oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   Barely 24 hours later, Elway was destroying the rest of the
Falcons' week in Miami with a performance fit for a king, which is
what he was.
</P>
<P>
   After he dove over from 2 yards out to score Denver's final
touchdown, Elway jogged off the field holding the ball over his
head. As he came to the sideline, Elway high-fived everyone he
passed on his way to the bench, a conquering hero home from what
may have been his last battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll remember that walk for the rest of my life,'' Elway said,
and surely he will, because if this was his last battle, it was a
marvelously designed one from the opening drive until Elway fell
into the end zone with the Broncos' final touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't mention anything about our passing game all
week,'' Elway said. ``I didn't take that personally because if they
don't stop Terrell Davis, he'd get 300 yards. But we went in
knowing we were going to have the opportunity to throw and if we
were going to win we would have to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway did that from the outset, but it was the Falcons who
started off with a bang, taking the opening kickoff 31 yards to the
37-yard line, and gashing the Denver defensive front with Jamal
Anderson, who had a 13-yard gain on the first play from scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson (96 yards on 18 carries) continued to pound down the
Broncos, but the Falcons' drive stalled on the Denver 8 when Bill
Romanowski sacked Chris Chandler for a 7-yard loss on third down.
The Falcons settled for a 32-yard Morten Andersen field goal,
giving them their only lead of the night.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos wasted no time answering that challenge, marching 80
yards while running an assortment of odd formations that seemed to
unsettle the Falcon defense.
</P>
<P>
   Denver lined up Davis wide on the opening play, with no running
back in the backfield, and went into a shotgun on second down. But
it was a play on third and 7 at the Denver 35 that set the tone for
the half. Wide receiver Rod Smith started out in the backfield and
then went into motion. After he turned upfield, he was wide open
and Elway found him for a 41-yard completion to the Atlanta 24.
</P>
<P>
   Three Davis runs and a 14-yard Elway-to-Shannon Sharpe
completion put the ball on the 1, and fullback Howard Griffith then
had his number called for only the fifth time this season. He used
the opportunity as well as you could, scoring the game's first
touchdown to give the Broncos the lead.
</P>
<P>
   The pace slowed briefly after that until Ronnie Bradford picked
off an Elway pass that bounced off the hands of Sharpe at the
Denver 36 and gave the Falcons another chance to attack.
</P>
<P>
   Attack they did, but on fourth and 1 at the Broncos 27, Atlanta
ran a toss right to Anderson and Denver's defense ran him down for
a 2-yard loss that gave the Broncos the ball and the momentum. They
marched 63 yards on 11 plays before settling for a 25-yard field
goal by Jason Elam that made it 10-3 with 9:17 to play in the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons might have survived that, but they were again unable
to score a touchdown after penetrating the Denver 10 for the second
time. This time Chandler put too much on a pass to a wide open Tim
Dwight in the end zone on third down, and the ball sailed high and
wild over the receiver's head.
</P>
<P>
   After Andersen missed what is normally a chip shot, 26-yard
field goal attempt, Elway then drove a stake through the heart of
the Falcons and, in particular, poor, bedeviled Robinson. The
quarterback sent Smith on a deep in pattern against an Atlanta
zone, and Smith ran right by the safety, who had the deep coverage.
</P>
<P>
   As Smith sprinted downfield, Elway delivered a perfectly thrown
ball over his shoulder behind Robinson, and the receiver loped for
an 80-yard touchdown that made the score 17-3 with 4:54 to play in
the half.
</P>
<P>
   Only 22 hours earlier, Robinson had been arrested in downtown
Miami, a development that came hours after a tearful Robinson had
been presented the Bart Starr Award for community service and high
moral character.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the scrappy Falcons refused to wilt easily. They came right
back when Dwight returned the kickoff 42 yards to the 49, but once
again a good opportunity did not produce what Atlanta needed, as
the Falcons reached the 11 but could not score a touchdown. They
settled for Andersen's 28-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Although that reduced Denver's lead to 11 with 2:25 to play in
the half, the Falcons' inability to turn productive drives into
touchdowns was hurting them, and that, combined with the fact that
Elway was playing the best he ever had in a Super Bowl, was proving
lethal for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   By halftime, Elway was 9 of 15 for 199 yards and a score, which
was nearly twice his passing yardage in each of his last two Super
Bowl appearances, a hint that he was on the verge of coming through
on his hope of finishing what was expected to be his final game
with ``my greatest performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it was becoming his greatest Super Bowl performance.
After halftime, he twice took the Broncos into field goal territory
in the third quarter, only to have Elam miss both kicks. But Elway
remained unfazed, in part because Denver's defense responded by
twice intercepting Chandler throws to blunt Atlanta's efforts to
get back into the game.
</P>
<P>
   The second pickoff proved most costly, because the Falcons had
moved to the Broncos 21 before Keith Traylor tipped a Chandler pass
intended for tight end O.J. Santiago and the ball was picked off by
cornerback Darrien Gordon and returned 58 yards to the Falcons 24
with time running out in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   At this point it was still 17-6, but the Broncos had dominated
the quarter on both offense and defense. That superiority finally
overwhelmed the Falcons when Elway hit another critical pass, a
15-yard completion to McCaffrey on third and 6 at the 20 to set up
Griffith's second 1-yard touchdown run, this one at 14:56 of the
fourth quarter. That made it 24-6 and made clear whose night this
would be.
</P>
<P>
   If doubters remained, however, Chandler soon convinced them by
throwing his third straight interception, again to Gordon. On this
one, Gordon cut in front of Tony Martin at the Denver 4-yard line,
grabbed the pass on a full run, and sprinted 50 yards to the
Falcons 48.
</P>
<P>
   One 39-yard completion later and Elway had the Dirty Birds all
but plucked, a process he finished off himself when he burrowed in
on a 3-yard quarterback draw to make it 31-6 with a little over 11
minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, Dwight finally did what he'd been threatening all
night, breaking a kickoff for a 94-yard touchdown that allowed the
Falcons to avoid being the first team since Super Bowl VI not to
score a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   That score was a moral victory for the Falcons. After Robinson's
problems from the night before, they could use it. They just
couldn't use it to beat John Elway.

UNSUNG DENVER DEFENSE GROUNDS `DIRTY BIRDS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The ``Dirty Birds'' have been de-flocked by a bunch of
nobodies.
</P>
<P>
   Those overlooked, underpublicized no-names on the Denver
Broncos' defense held the Atlanta Falcons without an offensive
touchdown until the final three minutes in winning Super Bowl
XXXIII, 34-19, on Sunday before 74,803 fans at Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard a lot about them running against us, a lot about them
doing the ``Dirty Bird'' (touchdown dance), but in the end, only
the score matters,'' Broncos defensive tackle Keith Traylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback John Elway, likely retiring after his 16th season,
was picked as the game's Most Valuable Player after throwing for
336 yards, the third most in Super Bowl history. All-Pro running
back Terrell Davis rushed for a game-high 102 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But the Broncos wouldn't have won their second consecutive Super
Bowl without a defense that forced four turnovers, including
intercepting Atlanta quarterback Chris Chandler three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at what our defense did in the playoffs,'' said
cornerback Darrien Gordon, who set a Super Bowl record with 108
yards on two interception returns. ``Miami, we blew them out. The
Jets, we shut them down. There was the same outcry about our
secondary (being weak), but we gave up only six points in two
games. When are people going to realize, our defense can play?''
</P>
<P>
   Until the Falcons' scored a garbage touchdown with 2:04 left,
the only touchdown the Broncos' defense had given up came on a
1-yard run by the New York Jets after the Jets recovered a blocked
punt on Denver's 1-yard line in the AFC title game.
</P>
<P>
   Six times, the Falcons reached inside Denver's 30-yard line in
the first three quarters, and they scored only six points.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the question is whether the Broncos can become the first
team in NFL history to win three straight Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``A three-peat definitely would put us in dynasty status,''
Gordon said of the Broncos, who have won an NFL-record 46 games the
past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos' chances of winning a third Super Bowl in a row
could depend on whether Elway returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``That chance goes to 95 percent, 98 (percent) with John coming
back, but we can do it without him,'' tight end Shannon Sharpe
said. ``I'm thinking of that already. I'm thinking about being in
Atlanta in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway wouldn't discuss after the game his chances of returning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to cross that bridge,'' Elway said. ``This is
what I came back for and was working months for. Nothing feels
better.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was billed as ``The Feud,'' with Elway and Broncos
Coach Mike Shanahan going against their old boss, Falcons Coach Dan
Reeves. It was no contest.
</P>
<P>
   Denver jumped to a 31-6 lead against Reeves, who now has lost
four Super Bowls by a combined total of 178-59.
</P>
<P>
   Any chance the Falcons had ended in third quarter although
Denver's Jason Elam missed two field goals with the Broncos
leading, 17-6.
</P>
<P>
   After Elam's first miss, Chandler was intercepted by backup
cornerback Darrius Johnson at the Broncos' 30.
</P>
<P>
   Elam missed from 48 yards with 3:49 left in the third quarter,
but a Falcons turnover stopped another drive.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler's pass was tipped by defensive tackle Keith Traylor at
the line of scrimmage and intercepted by Gordon at the Broncos' 18.
He returned it 58 yards to the Atlanta 24 to set up the second of
fullback Howard Griffith's two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were in my face all day,'' Chandler said. ``They did a
good job up front of compressing the pocket. A lot of times guys
were just throwing their hands up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos frustrated Chandler from the outset. He drove them
to Denver's 7 on the first drive. But Broncos linebacker Bill
Romanowski blitzed and Chandler was sacked for a 7-yard loss on
third down, and the Falcons were forced to settle for a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their quarterback had a little bit of a history of getting
hurt and rattled,'' Romanowski said of Chandler, the ex-Cardinal
who was sacked twice. ``We felt we could get some hits on him and
that could shake him up.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver then went 80-yard in 10 plays to take a 7-3 lead, a
41-yard pass from Elway to wide receiver Rod Smith setting up
Griffith's 1-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos had extended the lead to 10-3 when Atlanta's Morten
Andersen missed a 26-yard field goal with 5:07 left in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   On the next play, Elway threw deep to Smith, who beat free
safety Eugene Robinson for an 80-yard score and a 17-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``In last year's Super Bowl, our running game was really
working,'' said Broncos wide receiver Ed McCaffrey of Davis' 157
yards in the victory over the Green Bay Packers. ``There was no
need to put the ball in the air. We took advantage of what was
working.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, they shut down our running games at times. So, we took
advantage of what was working. We threw the ball.'' &QL;

DENVER'S LINE SCORE WAS BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL McDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Broncos quarterback John Elway could have played
Sunday's game in a tuxedo and not have had to send it out to be
cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver offensive line was that good. For two years in a row,
it has been the silent force behind Super Bowl victories.
</P>
<P>
   Elway got deserved kudos for his best Super Bowl performance.
But he was barely touched as his offensive line completely shackled
what had been an excellent Atlanta front four against all other
opponents this season, including the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC
Championship games.
</P>
<P>
   Some thought Minnesota, which set a scoring record in the league
this season, had the best offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Denver reaffirmed Sunday beyond a doubt that its is the best,
illustrated by its taking control of a Super Bowl again.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, this bunch dominated the Packers in the second half,
setting Terrell Davis up for the Most Valuable Player trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night in Pro Player Stadium, the Broncos line walled off
a quick, athletic gang of Atlanta tacklers and allowed Elway to get
through the game virtually unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   It was a virtuoso performance. Not once in the game was Denver
flagged for a false start. And just once were the Broncos called
for holding, and it was a good penalty. One of the Atlanta rushers
had broken loose up the middle just before the end of the first
half, and he was hauled down and prevented from getting a clean
shot at Elway.
</P>
<P>
   With this kind of protection, Denver dominated the game with its
passing. The Falcons moved the ball but could not finish. Three
times, with the game up for grabs in the first half, they moved
inside the Denver 20, but they got only two field goals.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's coaches were concerned before the game that Denver's
plan would be to spread them out on defense. When they last met a
year ago in Atlanta, Denver scored the first three times it touched
the ball by using four wide receivers and forcing Atlanta, which
likes to play zone defense, to cover man-to-man.
</P>
<P>
   The first two times they touched the ball Sunday night, Denver
went with all receivers and no one at the running back position.
That seemed to end any thoughts the Falcons had of blitzing Elway,
and without any pressure on him, Elway was able to function at his
best.
</P>
<P>
   Denver even complemented this part of its attack by having Elway
roll out of the pocket to the right to get a better look at his
receivers. In the AFC Championship game, the Jets rushers had
tipped and deflected a half-dozen passes on him.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Smith, the fastest of the Broncos receivers, got the
man-to-man coverage his coaches hoped he would. They kept Smith
away from Ray Buchanan, the best of the Atlanta cover men, and he
feasted on the rest.
</P>
<P>
   When it was still a game, he beat the slower Eugene Robinson
deep down the middle for an 80-yard touch-down, with Elway rolling
out of the pocket and getting a clear view.
</P>
<P>
   It is the popular belief that Elway can throw the ball with the
velocity of old only when he can step up in the pocket, or with no
one in front of him, to get all of his body into the throw.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets packed their defense into the middle of the field two
weeks ago, trying to force Elway to throw to the outside, where the
tosses must be longer. But Atlanta's middle was wide open all day,
and so were Elway's chances, and his receivers.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons played like a team in its first Super Bowl. They
missed a bunch of tackles. Quarterback Chris Chandler was clearly
flustered. He had receivers open all night, and either threw the
ball poorly or didn't see the open man.
</P>
<P>
   He threw three interceptions in the second half on consecutive
possessions.
</P>
<P>
   The wacky thing about Atlanta's offensive game was that the
Falcons played great on first down, ripping off big yardage, yet
never could make the big play after that.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Jamal Anderson did a great job, but the Atlanta
passing game, which had been the best in the league this year with
a gaudy 15.8-yards-per-completion average, disintegrated.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams ran the ball well, but only one threw it well.
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos blitzed more than usual to pressure Chandler and
force him into bad throws. A few times he should have thrown the
ball away or simply taken the sack, rather than throwing it into a
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons seemed to get a big break early in the game when
Denver tight end Shannon Sharpe left with a twisted knee. The
Falcons thought he was the player they would have the most trouble
trying to cover. They were wrong. No one could handle Rod Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos defense gave up yardage but not points. Atlanta
didn't score a touchdown until the fourth period, when Tim Dwight
ran a kickoff back.
</P>
<P>
   Denver has established itself as the best team in football. And
``team'' is the appropriate word. The Broncos do things well as a
team, from the execution of their offensive line to their multiple
defensive schemes.
</P>
<P>
   They started out the season wanting to be perfect and couldn't
get over the top on that score. But they ended the season
unquestionably the best in the game, and they have a long time to
be happy with that.

IT'S SAME SAD SONG FOR FALCONS' REEVES 
</HEADLINE>
 BOWL-FALCONS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The shadow of Eugene Robinson that hung over the Atlanta
Falcons and Sunday night's Super Bowl was so thick that it seemed
almost imposible to see the game. So much so that Atlanta coach Dan
Reeves felt Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler ``had played well
for his first Super Bowl'' and Chandler himself agreed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Chandler time and again turned his mind and his words
to a tipped pass in the third quarter that was intercepted by
cornerback Darrien Gordon at the Denver 18-yard line, when the
Falcons were trailing, 17-6, and threatening to tighten the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like I'd been throwing all day, Terance Mathis was
running a corner route on that play,'' said Chandler of the play
that dashed Atlanta's hopes. ``Their corners really sink way inside
and all I had to do was throw the ball over (Gordon's) head to the
corner. But their guy tipped it.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was simply bad luck that defensive lineman Keith
Traylor barely was able to get the the tip of his middle finger on
Chandler's pass, allowing Gordon to make the easiest of
interceptions. But it was not bad luck that saw Atlanta four times
reach the Denver 21-yard line or better and come away with only two
field goals. A fifth time Atlanta reached the Denver 26 and came up
with nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to guess what would have happened if we hadn't had
the ball tipped,'' Chandler said in one variation of the theme he
returned to several times. ``That would have been a good chance for
us to score a touchdown and get back into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl quarterbacks are total failures when their team five
times delves so deep into enemy territory and comes away with a
measly 6 points. Once, in the first half, Chandler had Tony Martin
open in right corner of the end zone but he floated _ rather than
zipped _ the pass and it was broken up.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, receiver Tim Dwight was all alone in the end zone,
but Chandler overthrew him. Still another time, Chandler threw a
fade pass toward Martin in the left corner of the end zone and
Gordon made a superb play to break it up. And then there was the
pass to Martin near the goal line early in the fourth quarter that
also was picked off by Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Broncos leave the middle of the field open a lot,'' said
Chandler of that misread between him and Martin. ``We had talked a
lot during the week about it. It's like we're trying to flatten out
the post route and make it an in route. And Tony felt at the last
second he could go on top of the route and we were just thinking
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chandler's mind, though, it was that tipped pass, ``because
if Terance doesn't score there on the pass, it's going to be
awfully close to a score. Then, who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves was crushed that his offense had so few points to show
for so many scoring opportunities for his offense. ``The whole
thing boiled down to their stopping us in the red zone,'' said
Reeves. ``We had been so good down there all year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't make the plays when we needed to make them,'' said
Reeves, words that apply to any team that loses a Super Bowl. ``In
the second half, we had two plays where we felt we could get back
into the game, and two times we felt we were open, and we get one
of them tipped for an interception and then we throw an
interception on the other one.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss was a crusher for Reeves, his fourth in a Super Bowl.
The final salt in the wound was his postgame meeting with Broncos
coach Mike Shanahan, when he had to congratulate his nemesis. In
1992, Reeves fired Shanahan, then his assistant in Denver, for
insubordination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Mike after the game and congratulated him on a
great win and and also on his record,'' Reeves said, referring to
Denver's 17-2 mark. ``When you win the most football games of
everybody, that tells you you've done a tremendous job as a
coach.''

AN UPSTANDING REPUTATION IS TRIPPED UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN AND WILL McDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Forty-five minutes after Sunday night's Super Bowl,
safety Eugene Robinson finally emerged from the Atlanta Falcons
locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who Saturday night was arrested in Miami and charged
with soliciting sex from an undercover police officer, read from a
script, saying, ``My lawyer has advised me not to discuss about my
arrest. That will be handled in due time by authorities. And I
feel, I strongly feel, I will be found innocent. But what I really
want to do now is to apologize to my Lord Jesus Christ, and
secondly to my wife (Gia) and kids, and thirdly to my teammates and
to the entire NFL and the (Atlanta) organization for any
distractions I may have caused.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret I was not maintaining the standards I had set for
myself,'' Robinson continued, ``and I will continue to try to make
amends to everyone who knows me. I want to thank a lot of the
football people, and this includes a lot of the fans, and a lot of
the players, and especially my family for praying for me at this
very low point.''
</P>
<P>
   This indeed, is a low point for Robinson, who Saturday morning
was honored for high moral character, presented the Bart Starr
Award as his family looked on with pride.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night came the arrest, and Sunday night Robinson was
burned by Rod Smith on a second-quarter fly pattern for an 80-yard
Denver touchdown as the Broncos won, 34-19.
</P>
<P>
   Angel Calzadilla, a spokesman for the Miami police, said
Robinson offered $40 to an undercover policewoman for oral sex.
After his arrest, he was released to the custody of Atlanta general
manager Harold Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   In his biography in the Falcons press guide, Robinson is quoted
as saying, ``I tell people I'm a Christian who just happens to play
football.'' That's part of the reason Athletes in Action, renowned
in professional sports for its commitment to Christianity, chose
Robinson for the Starr Award, named after the great Packers
quarterback who was the Most Valuable Player in Green Bay's
victories in the first two Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   After his opening statements following Sunday night's Atlanta
loss, Robinson deviated from the script and said, ``I really got no
sleep (Saturday) night ... But when it came to the game, I was
really focused on the game ... I'm kind of ad-libbing on my script
here, but I don't really think we played well enough to win the
game. So I've got to take my hat off to the Denver Broncos.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said when he returned to the hotel, tears flowed, and
he spent hours on his knees asking God's forgiveness. ``Once again,
and I want to reiterate, I really believe and I strongly believe I
will be found innocent of this deal. However, I was not righteous
in this deal.''
</P>
<P>
   As to comments on the game, Robinson tried to explain the Smith
play as ``a mixup in communication in the secondary.'' But then he
said, ``I was trying to do a little too much out there. I was a
little too zealous out there ... That long pass really will haunt
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver coach Dan Reeves said Robinson's arrest wasn't a
distraction, but wide receiver Tony Martin summed up the feelings
of his teammates, Atlanta's fans, and much of football. ``I was
shocked that it was Eugene,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves chose to focus on the effect of the arrest on Robinson,
the man. ``I don't know anybody who hasn't made mistakes in their
lives,'' he said. ``We love Eugene unconditionally. That's the
thing we based everything on. Nobody is more embarrassed about this
than Eugene, but I'm not going to crucify him.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Atlanta sources, when Robinson returned to the
hotel after being released by police, his first stop was the room
of Reeves, where Robinson explained to the coach what happened.
After that conversation, Robinson then went to the rooms of several
veterans and told them of the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, most teams have moved out of the hotel
they had been in all week the night before the game and gone to a
smaller hotel closer to the stadium. There, the players were
virtually locked up until they took the team bus to the game.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves not only kept his team in the same hotel, but he also
didn't hold meetings Saturday night, and reportedly did not have a
curfew.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was not with his family Saturday night. Police say he
was driving a car along Biscayne Boulevard, where prostitutes are
known to ply their trade, when he engaged the undercover agent in
conversation and reportedly propositioned her. The scene of the
arrest is just a couple of miles away from the Atlanta team hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years ago, almost to the hour, the life of the Bengals'
Stanley Wilson blew up, and it has been spiraling downward ever
since. On that Super Bowl eve in the same city, Wilson,
Cincinnati's starting fullback, did a large amount of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   When he did not show up for a team meeting, Bengals security was
sent to his room. They could hear Wilson inside, but he would not
open the door. Hotel security was summoned, forced the door open,
and went in. They found Wilson cowering in the bathroom, nearly
incoherent.
</P>
<P>
   A decision was made to remove Wilson from the team hotel and
take him back to the hotel where the Bengals had stayed earlier in
the week. Wilson was put in the custody of a Cincinnati police
officer who regularly traveled with the team for security purposes.
However, early Sunday morning, Wilson escaped and disappeared onto
the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's team lost a last-minute heartbreaker to Joe Montana and
the San Francisco 49ers, 20-16, and many believe his absence
affected the Bengals' performance. He never played another game,
and in the years since, he has been arrested three times, most
recently for armed robbery. He goes to trial soon in California and
faces a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson had built a sterling reputation in the NFL. He has been
a Pro Bowl player, spending most of his career in Seattle, before
moving on to Green Bay and then Atlanta via free agency. In
Seattle, he was a four-time Man of the Year for his work wih the
Boys and Girls Clubs and Union Gospel Mission. In Green Bay, for
which he played in the Super Bowl last year, he worked to raise
money to fight cerebral palsy.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, he has more interceptions than any other active
player. He has been a calming force for the young Falcon defense,
the player who makes most of the adjustments during the game.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's wife, his 11-year-old daughter, Brittany, and his
9-year-old son, Brandon, were at the team hotel when Robinson was
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's father, Samuel, was waiting with other members of the
family when Eugene was released. ``The children asked questions.
They have feelings,'' Samuel Robinson told the Associated Press.
``My son talked to both kids, and that's a good deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Robinson said he was ``very concerned'' for his
daughter-in-law. ``She's doing better  &UR; today &LR; ,'' he said. ``She had
to compose herself.''
</P>
<P>
   All week long Robinson, a Hartford native, had been telling his
younger teammates what not to do during Super Bowl week. He had
been telling them that one reason the Patriots had lost to his
Packers in the Super Bowl two years ago was ``because the Patriots
were out on the streets'' of New Orleans. All week long he had been
preaching that he had found the straight and narrow path because of
God.
</P>
<P>
   When asked during the week what consumes most of his
away-from-the-field time during Super Bowl week, he said,
``Probably your family. You have to put a limit of how much you
allow your family to intrude. You can't be worried about relatives
who need hotel rooms or tickets or anything like that. My wife is
great at insulating me from the rest of my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Reeves said the incident didn't distract the Falcons,
they all were aware of the matter beforehand. ``Anybody but
Eugene,'' Atlanta linebacker Henri Crockett told ESPN after news of
the arrest initially spread. ``He knows the do's and don'ts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The ramifications of this are far-reaching,'' said Robinson
after the game, ``and you have no idea of the gravity of the
situation and how it's going to reach people and how it's going to
affect people. A good friend of mine said, `Confession is good for
the soul but bad for the reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Reputation I can deal with, but my wife ... that means so much
more. And I'm sorry I had to drag her through that episode, and I'm
sorry it even happened. It goes far beyond football ... my wife has
been so stellar. I don't want to minimize her pain and I'm deeply,
deeply sorry for what I did to her.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would not condemn those who describe him ``as a
hypocritical Christian,'' and then cut off the questions.
</P>
<P>
   But they may not go away for quite a while.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The way Darrien Gordon saw it, Chris Chandler tried to
dance the dance but didn't have any rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Chandler had happy feet,'' said Gordon after he
intercepted two of Chandler's passes to key a stout defensive
effort in Denver's 34-19 victory over Atlanta Sunday night in the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Happy feet is the expression players use to desribe a
quarterback whose nerves have taken over his body under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our front four had good pressure on Chandler all day,'' said
Gordon, who also had two interceptions against the Jets in the AFC
Championship Game two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon says Chandler felt the pressure and couldn't respond.
``We did a good job of disguising what we were doing on defense,''
he said. ``We showed him a look like we were going to play zone,
and we blitzed him. Then we showed him a blitz, and we played zone.
We tried to make Chandler beat us and he couldn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a defense we were determined not to let their running game
beat us. We wanted to put it all on Chandler. Our defensive line,
and our blitzing, caused him problems. There were times when he
wasn't sure what he wanted to do with the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver did a nice job of bringing pressure up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   In the heat of Miami, the Broncos rotated their defensive
linemen throughout the game, keeping them fresh. Often, they put
their taller linemen in the middle of the rush, and several times
they were able to knock down Chandler passes. The first
interception he threw came off a deflection by defensive end Keith
Traylor, which Gordon picked off on the fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really disappointed with myself after the second
interception,'' said Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have taken it all the way back for a touchdown. But I
ran out of gas and Chandler tackled me. That was really
embarrassing when he tackled me in the open field, but I was just
tired and lost my legs.''

NO SENSE OF SATISFACTION FROM SUPER BOWL SOAP OPERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The Three-Penny Opera of Super Bowl XXXIII is over. The
Not-So-Three Amigos will go off into the sunset now.
</P>
<P>
   John Elway to The Decision. Mike Shanahan to next season's
killer game plans. Dan Reeves to a healing heart and an Atlanta
football team that is appropriately satisfied for its terrific
season, even if the Falcons found out Sunday that their quarterback
is nothing close to a Hall of Famer and their coach did not show
the Denver Broncos anything they could not handle.
</P>
<P>
   Advantage, Mike and John.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to opera, however, or soap opera, as the saga of
Dan, John and Mike has seemed this Super Bowl season, there was so
much left unsaid, so much left unresolved. It makes you feel a
little empty.
</P>
<P>
   As Bronco tight end Shannon Sharpe told us so succinctly in the
hyper-mouthed days leading up to Sunday's 34-19 Denver victory:
``John hates Dan. Dan hates Mike. Mike and John are best friends.
Enough said.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the story line of this Super Bowl in the south Florida.
A little steamy. A little seedy. And, like so many other human
dramas, one without a neat bow to tie it all up and send us off
feeling completely satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   In that way, Super Bowls imitate life.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, as Super Bowl MVP Elway was standing on the podium
addressing the media about everything except his future plans _
he'll cross that bridge when he comes to it _ his old coach
suddenly appeared from behind the curtain.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reeves had come by to tell his old quarterback
``Congratulations.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the most awkward moments in sports, at least since
earlier in January when Chicago Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf handed
Michael Jordan his championship ring and the two barely made eye
contact.
</P>
<P>
   There was no love lost between Reeves and Elway. And no love
gained this week either. Reeves looked awkward doing what he felt
was right. He looked like he was in pain.
</P>
<P>
   For all the glory that will be heaped upon Elway for such a
stellar Super Bowl performance _ when Elway rolled out and threw
18-yard darts, when he bulled over the goal line for an ecstatic,
exclamatory quarterback draw, when he connected on a 80-yard
touchdown pass to Rod Smith like he was 28 years old instead of a
grizzled 38 _ there was a little sadness connected to his heroics.
</P>
<P>
   Elway still believes that Reeves has cost him dearly. Elway's
career will always be defined by ``what if'' the Broncos had won
any or all of those first three Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   While Elway says it is water under the bridge, he and his family
have certainly been candid in suggesting his career was severely
hampered by Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's the best quarterback that ever played,'' Jack
Elway said about his son Sunday, after the younger Elway had reeled
off 336 passing yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``And yes, I think he is better than (Joe) Montana. There is the
possibility that John could have two more (Super Bowl victories.)
But John is perceptive. He thinks Mike is the most complete
football coach in the game. Mike knows the value of being
organized. He knows the value of personnel. He's a good listener.''
</P>
<P>
   A Super Bowl is surely bigger than any one person. It wasn't
Reeves vs. Elway and Shanahan, but even Elway's wife, Janet, spoke
this week about the different sort of career totals her husband
might have if things had been different.
</P>
<P>
   It is a strange way to wrap up a career, if this is it for
Elway.
</P>
<P>
   It was an awful weird twist of fate that in the very last game
of what has become one of the most compelling and (finally)
triumphant careers, Elway faced his old coach and came up big, as
if to make a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said all along that if they can stop Terrell Davis, they
would take their chance on being beat by John Elway,'' said Sharpe,
who got to watch the Elway MVP show from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you don't get to be the all-time best passing
quarterback by being so-so. What better way for him to showcase
that he is the best quarterback to ever play the game. Can the guy
still play? Yes. Can the guy play next year and the year after
that? Probably,'' Sharpe said.
</P>
<P>
   Elway's decision will come, although Sharpe joked that just like
after last Super Bowl he was going to find out Elway's decision
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, meanwhile, will go back to work with the Falcons, first
to prove that they were no Cinderellas this season, then to go
about the task of, maybe, finally, winning a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course this is disappointing, although we've come an
awfully long way to be a team in the Super Bowl,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you get here, the more they hurt. But it's like the
guy said in `Chariots of Fire.' `I'm not going to run if I can't
win,' to which the other guy said `You can't win if you don't run.'
This whole society is built on winning, but I'm just going to
congratulate the winner and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   If Super Bowl XXXIII taught us anything, it's that what happened
in the past will affect what you do today. Why do you think Elway
was pumping his fists? Why do you think after that 3-yard
quarterback draw for a touchdown, he ran off the field with the
ball?

 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
MIAMI _ Going into the Super Bowl last year, John Elway's
spectacular career had included everything but a Super Bowl
champion's ring.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He got that ring.
</P>
<P>
   All that would beat that this year would be a ring and the Most
Valuable Player trophy.
</P>
<P>
   He will take home both.
</P>
<P>
   For Elway, the 38-year-old Denver Broncos quarterback who bucked
retirement for another NFL season, Sunday was the pinnacle. It just
doesn't get any better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled to death to be a part of this team and thrilled
to death that I could help us win,'' Elway said after the Broncos'
34-19 win over the Atlanta Falcons. ``This is what we play for. To
be able to do it two years in a row is unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   For at least one day, Elway refused to discuss his retirement.
It has been assumed the perennial Pro Bowler would retire at the
end of this season. But now, the incentive grows. No quarterback
has ever won three consecutive Super Bowls. But Elway won't say if
that's one more record he's putting on his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even going to talk about it,'' he said. ``I'm just
going to enjoy this win. I'm thrilled to death with this win, and I
will cross that bridge later on. I don't want to talk about
retirement right now.''
</P>
<P>
   He might no longer be in his prime, but even on the downside of
his career, Elway is better than most. Sunday, he didn't look like
he had lost a thing as he completed 18 of 29 passes for 336 yards
and one touchdown. A spectacular 80-yarder to Rod Smith was vintage
Elway, and the one fans will remember if this proves to have been
his last game.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Elway's still got it going on,'' Atlanta cornerback Ray
Buchanan said. ``Don't let anybody tell you to retire.''
</P>
<P>
   With 2,000-yard rusher Terrell Davis, Elway has had less
pressure over the past couple of seasons. And though Davis rushed
for 102 yards on 25 carries Sunday, Elway stole the show. Besides
the 80-yarder to Smith, Elway completed a 39-yarder to Davis and a
25-yarder to Ed McCaffrey. He spread the ball among six Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Elway said he was confident in the Broncos' passing game during
the week leading up to the game. ``The talk was about our running
game the whole week,'' he said, ``and they didn't mention anything
about the passing game. I really went into this game knowing that
we would have an opportunity to throw the football and that if we
were to win the game, it would probably be through the air because
they are a good run-defense team.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Elway, his teammates are certain they wouldn't have two
Super Bowl title rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he did (play his last game), he sure is going out in
style,'' McCaffrey said. ``He is by far the best quarterback in the
game and probably of all time. I am extremely fortunate to have had
the opportunity to play for him and win two Super Bowls with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Denver coach Mike Shanahan: ``I have been around John for
at least 15 years, and I have the utmost respect for him and how he
handles himself, how he works, how he perseveres. He has kept on
working to possibly end his career with two Super Bowls. It speaks
for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   He has played 16 seasons, but if Elway walks away, it will be
because his mind is ready, not his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty great right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He had a legacy long before winning his first Super Bowl. If he
leaves the game, he leaves having accomplished all he could.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unbelievable,'' Elway said. ``It's something that I had
never done before, and winning the (MVP) award definitely hit my
heart. It definitely hit my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   As he has hit so many others.

 ROBERTSON-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DALE ROBERTSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
MIAMI _ John Elway was very good. Eugene Robinson was very bad. And
therein, plain and simple, lay the difference in Super Bowl XXXIII.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hero. Goat. Star. Stupe. Leader. Loser.
</P>
<P>
   A real dirty bird, that Eugene.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson accounted for the XXX, Elway the III, as in !!!. If
ever two men represented the extreme opposite ends of the Super
Bowl experience, it would be Denver's fabled, fairy-tale-scripting
quarterback and Atlanta's suddenly infamous free (on his own
recognizance) safety.
</P>
<P>
   The former deftly directed his team to another NFL championship
Sunday _ 34-19 _ in what figures to be the final game of a most
prolific, almost perfect 16-season career. This after the latter
dragged his team down, down, down, both making a fool of himself
and likely thwarting any chance the 7{-point-underdog Falcons had
of steeling themselves sufficiently to stage an upset.
</P>
<P>
   All total, the Falcons' frog-to-prince-to-frog quarterback,
Chris Chandler, had a far worse 60 minutes of football, throwing
three second-half interceptions and making a mockery of his status
as the the NFL's top-rated red-zone producer during the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   But Robinson definitely had the more miserable, and
debilitating, 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Having earned a champion's ring as a Packer two seasons ago,
Eugene was supposed to be Atlanta's chief mentor and motivator, the
wizened old pro who could set the more impressionable Falcons on
his knee and show them how to handle the pressures of the zaniest,
most draining week in sports. They hadn't been here before, you
know. Not even close.
</P>
<P>
   For the Falcons to have a chance, they needed for every little
detail to break perfectly for them. The most minor of distractions
figured to send them reeling helplessly off track, and there was
nothing minor about the arrest of the brightest, most articulate
and most senior member of the defense for soliciting the favors of
a streetwalker.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day he had received the Bart Starr Award for
selfless community service _ and, honest to goodness, his high
moral fiber _ he sneaked away from his family and the Falcons'
compound after dark, driving to a seedy drug- and
prostitute-infested stretch of Biscayne Boulevard near downtown.
</P>
<P>
   There, he allegedly offered a woman $40 for oral sex. She
happened to be a Miami cop working undercover. You are tempted to
ask what he could have been thinking, but the question is moot. He
clearly wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson should feel like the second-dumbest man in America
today. Were it not for the ongoing Washington circus, he would be
alone at the top.
</P>
<P>
   His inexplicable, practically unfathomable decision to slip away
from his family and wind up in the wrong place at the wrong time on
the eve of the most important day in his long-troubled franchise's
history takes a permanent place in Super Bowl history _ but not one
the NFL's mighty PR machine will be inclined to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson called his arrest ``a misunderstanding'' and suggested
that he will be exonerated. But he also felt the need to apologize
_ in the following order _ to ``my Lord Jesus Christ, to my family
and to my teammates, for whatever distractions I caused.'' No
matter how the case against him is resolved, he said he will not
feel ``righteous.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the police released him around 10 p.m., he admitted he
didn't sleep a wink Saturday night. A fine way to ready oneself for
a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson would be badly burned on the 80-yard Elway touchdown
pass to Rod Smith that set the game's inevitable course in the
second quarter. He was also juked off his feet by Terrell Davis on
a 39-yard fourth-quarter reception that led to the last Denver
touchdown, good for a 31-6 lead and assuring Atlanta of a humbling
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Guess Eugene's legs were dead and his thoughts elsewhere, like
on saving his marriage and repairing his image, although surely
it's shot in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   You feel sorry for his wife, Gia, to be sure, and their two
small children. But you also can't help but feel sorry for Dan
Reeves, whom Robinson betrayed just as badly, albeit in a different
way.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves lost his fourth Super Bowl Sunday, leaving him in the 0-4
company of Marv Levy and Bud Grant. Also, he lost it to the
organization with which he dropped the previous three, and to the
quarterback who, by all accounts, ultimately ran him out of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Sentimentally speaking, Reeves needed a win a lot worse than
Elway or Mike Shanahan, his former Broncos assistant. Elway and
Shanahan finally got theirs last year. Chances are now that Reeves
will never get his, since you must figure the Falcons, if 33 years
of ugly history are a reliable gauge, seem poor prospects to
reprise their lone NFC championship any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Having been a part of nine Super Bowls, Reeves understood the
value of leadership and experience under these skewed
circumstances. He had counted on Robinson to use his presumed ample
reservoir of both to help offset the Broncos' many advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the player kicked the coach squarely in his surgically
repaired heart. Once again, the mind boggles.

CHAMBERLAIN DOES HIS PART

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ This will not go down as one of the great Super Bowls,
but one thing it did have was a nice ``42d Street'' sub-plot.
</P>
<P>
   On the very first Denver possession, All-Pro tight end Shannon
Sharpe caught a John Elway pass, made his way toward the end zone,
took a fearsome hit, flipped upside down, and landed about a half
foot from the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   That was the last contribution he was going to make in Super
Bowl XXXIII. He had severly sprained his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Watching from his usual sideline perch was 27-year-old Byron
Chamberlain, a 1995 seventh-round draft pick whose job is to
understudy a star who normally needs no understudying. Suddenly,
this was, you know, it. The Big Moment.
</P>
<P>
   The first person to speak with Chamberlain was Terrell Davis,
his best friend on the team. Recalls Chamberlain, ``He said to me,
`This is what you've been talking about all this time. This is what
we've talked about at practice and sitting around both our houses.
This is your opportunity. Get out there and make some plays.'''
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that it was very early in the game. The Broncos
immediately scored to make it 7-3 in their favor, but there was a
lot of football to be played and Shannon Sharpe is a very important
player for this team.
</P>
<P>
   There was, as it turned out, nothing to worry about. Chamberlain
blocked. Chamberlain caught three passes for 29 yards. Chamberlain
even caught two Morten Andersen onside kicks in the fourth quarter.
Chamberlain, in other words, did the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prepare myself every day as if I were a starter,'' said the
affable Wayne State product. ``Mike Shanahan teaches you to do
that. It helped that John threw one my way early on. That gave me
some confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos didn't change anything with Chamberlain in the game.
``Mike Shanahan believes in tight ends,'' said Chamberlain. ``I
knew he had faith in me.''
</P>
<P>
   The TV folks weren't quite ready for Chamberlain. Pat Summerall
and John Madden referred to him as ``Brian.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that right?'' asked Chamberlain with a smile. ``The funny
thing is I do have a brother named Brian, and he was here today.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain said he had no idea how he was going to celebrate,
but that it definitely would involve both the Chamberlains and the
Davises. He will never forget the encouragement he got from a
league MVP.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at Shannon go down, and I'm not sure what to
think, but Terrell was right there,'' recalls Chamberlain. ``He
said, `This is your opportunity. You can do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Byron Chamberlain didn't let his buddy down.

SLEEPLESS IN MIAMI, ROBINSON ALLOWS BIG TD  
 BUT SAYS ARREST WASN'T A FACTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The Atlanta Falcons wanted Eugene Robinson as a leader,
a veteran who had been to the Super Bowl, someone who went out of
his way to participate in community service, someone who could be
an example for a rising young defense.
</P>
<P>
   After they signed him as an unrestricted free agent last March,
Robinson played a vital role on the Bomb Squad defense that helped
the Falcons win the NFC title.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday, on the eve of Super Bowl XXXIII, Robinson was
arrested by Miami police on a charge of soliciting a sex act from
an undercover police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Robinson, a free safety, went belly up in the game on
Sunday, being torched on an 80-yard touchdown pass from Denver
quarterback John Elway to Broncos wide receiver Rod Smith that
began the unraveling of the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Robinson, who said he broke a finger during the game
while tackling Broncos back Terrell Davis, said that he was
``confident I will be found innocent, however not righteous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I apologize to my Lord, Jesus Christ, my wife and kids, and
the tremendous NFL family for the distraction this has caused,''
said Robinson, reading from a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Then, departing from his script, Robinson said that he got
``absolutely no sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I still came to the game extremely focused,'' he said. ``This
incident did not affect my play. We just did not play well enough
to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had lots of time last night to think about how I was going
to respond. The ramifications are far-reaching. Confession is good
for the soul, but bad for the reputation. I truly love my wife and
kids, and I regret that this has hurt them. My wife has been
stellar through this in her support and prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Falcons Coach Dan Reeves and several players said they stayed up
with Robinson in support on Saturday night after he was released
from custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say it wasn't a distraction, I'm sure it was,'' Reeves
said. ``But it was not a major factor. My biggest job was to make
sure that he was ready to play, and he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Falcons cornerback Ray Buchanan said that it ``blew right over''
in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We embraced and I said to him, `If there was ever anybody who
had never sinned, let them step forward,' '' Buchanan said. ``We
are brothers on and off the field, and brothers in Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons were within striking distance, trailing, 10-3, and
driving in the second quarter. Then 17-year veteran kicker Morten
Andersen missed a 26-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   On the Broncos' first play following the miss, Smith cut past
Robinson in the middle of the field on a post route as Elway rolled
right. Smith made the catch and ran untouched to the second-longest
touchdown pass play in Super Bowl history. It was a rapid-fire
10-point swing that put the Falcons behind, 17-3, and seemed to sap
the life from the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the arrest had any effect on Robinson's performance, or
that overall of a defensive unit that had been strong all season _
one that beat the Minnesota Vikings and their highest-scoring
offense of all time in the conference championship _ is difficult
to assess.
</P>
<P>
   But without question, that quick scoring bomb turned the game.
Robinson said he broke his finger on a tackle of Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to bust Terrell's mouth,'' Robinson said. ``I broke a
finger I hit him so hard.''
</P>
<P>
   There were signs in Pro Player Stadium that read, ``Robinson for
President,'' and ``Give Him the Presidential Trophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, Robinson had received a Humanitarian of the
Year Award. Following that ceremony, he had been poolside at the
Falcons hotel in Fort Lauderdale with his wife, Gia, and their two
children.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson started every game for Atlanta, making 94 tackles and
intercepting four passes. With 53 career interceptions, he is the
leader among active NFL players.
</P>
<P>
   He was a member of the Green Bay Packers' Super Bowl
championship team two years ago and was on the Packers team that
lost in the Super Bowl to Denver last year.
</P>
<P>
   He has said that ``I'm not pretentious and stuck up and all that
stuff. I'm just a regular guy. It's just part of my personality to
reach out. I tell people I'm a Christian who just happens to play
football.'' &QL;

MR. SMITH GOES TO MIAMI, GETS TD  
 80-YARD PASS ON IMPROVISED PLAY HELPS BRONCOS BREAK ATLANTA

<P>
   MIAMI _ ``Keeper X-Post.''
</P>
<P>
   Ding. Bells rang and lights flashed in the mind of Denver
Broncos wide receiver Rod Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never expected to hear that,'' said Smith. ``It wasn't even
in the game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   With those words from Denver Broncos offensive coordinator Gary
Kubiak, Super Bowl XXXIII swung to the Broncos in the second
quarter when the game's Most Valuable Player, John Elway, connected
with Smith for 80 yards, the second-longest scoring-pass play in
the game's 33-year history, and sent the Broncos to a repeat of
their NFL championship with a 34-19 win.
</P>
<P>
   Coming on the first play after the Falcons missed a seemingly
easy field goal, the play completed a quick 10-point swing that
stunned the Broncos almost as much as it did the Falcons' Bomb
Squad defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been in the offense for four years, but we haven't used
it in about three or four weeks,'' Smith said. ``That's a tribute
to our coaches, the way they can adjust and put us in the best
situation to make plays. And it's a tribute to us. We're mature
enough and smart enough to adjust and make it go.
</P>
<P>
   ``After not catching a ball last year in the Super Bowl, this is
great. You want to feel you are a part of what's happening. I vowed
I was going to catch a ball. We wanted to get Terrell (Davis) the
ball enough to make them respect the run so they couldn't sit back
in nickel coverages.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked.
</P>
<P>
   While the Broncos have the league's leading rusher in Davis, it
was the passing game, with Smith leading the way with five
receptions for 152 yards, that burned Atlanta after he was shut out
by Green Bay last year.
</P>
<P>
   Smith had more than 1,200 receiving yards this season, yet his
fellow receiver, Ed McCaffrey, not Smith, is going to the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Smith is going, ``but only as Ed's guest. He's taking
me.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey caught five passes for 72 yards as he worked
underneath Falcons' coverages in the second half. After tight end
Shannon Sharpe suffered a knee injury, backup Byron Chamberlain
stepped up with three catches as Elway threw for 336 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Smith ran his post route past Falcons safety Eugene Robinson,
the NFL career leader in interceptions among active players.
Robinson was arrested Saturday night by Miami police on a charge of
soliciting a sex act for pay from an undercover officer.
</P>
<P>
   It might have made the difference. Robinson might have been
overaggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the Broncos had run Keeper X-Post. Elway kept the ball
on a bootleg. That was revealing, according to Broncos Coach Mike
Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came back to it and hit the big one to Rod, one of the
reasons we got that was that we had done the quarterback keep off
that earlier,'' Shanahan said. ``They jumped at our running game.
After we took a look at the (Polaroid) picture, we saw the safety
jump on it, so we came back with the pass route.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there was one turning point, but that play
helped us get the momentum. It was big. The safety bit a little
bit, and Rod got behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said the long touchdown pass ``will haunt me forever.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were supposed to rotate our coverage where (cornerback)
Ronnie Bradford was supposed to get a jam on Rod, but I don't think
Ronnie heard the call,'' Robinson said. ``Rod came off the line
straight. Now I have to make a decision. I had been trying to set
John Elway up for an interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``To John's credit, he threw it hard enough and far enough that
I had no shot at it.'' &QL;

DEFENSIVE STAR GORDON FACES RAZZING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Two Super Bowl rings won't help Denver Broncos
cornerback Darrien Gordon escape the wrath of his friends and
family.
</P>
<P>
   First, they're going to get on him for ``being knocked out'' for
the first time in his football career.
</P>
<P>
   Then they're going to razz him for letting Atlanta quarterback
Chris Chandler tackle him on a 58-yard interception return.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon can take the abuse. He knows his two interceptions played
a big part in the Broncos beating the Falcons, 34-19, in Super Bowl
XXXIII on Sunday at Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Both interceptions came after he suffered a concussion in the
second quarter when Atlanta running back Jamal Anderson kneed him
in the back of the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was out for a little while,'' said Gordon, a sixth-year pro.
``I heard a big ringing in my ear, and it felt like I had just
awakened from a long sleep. I was out for only about two seconds.
It seemed like hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon regained consciousness in time to grab a pass that
defensive tackle Keith Traylor deflected to him late in the third
quarter. Gordon ran down the right sideline and appeared to be
headed for a touchdown when Chandler tackled him at the Falcons' 24
after a 58-yard return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the daylight, but I guess the heat and the humidity and
the shot I took from Jamal caused my leg to go out from under me,''
Gordon said. ``But I can't make any excuses. I let Chandler tackle
me in the open field. My family is not going to let me forget
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the fourth quarter, Gordon intercepted Chandler again.
He cut in front of wide receiver Tony Martin and intercepted at the
Broncos' 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was off a route that (Kansas City's) Andre Rison had run on
us a couple of weeks ago for a touchdown, and I was looking for
that route,'' Gordon said. ``It was in the same area of the field.
We call that the strike zone, and it was the exact same route, so I
sat inside for it. Chandler didn't see me, and he threw it right to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos entered the game with the NFL's 26th-ranked pass
defense, but they intercepted Chandler three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a lot of criticism all year,'' Gordon said. ``The
media said we gave up 300 yards a game passing, but the bottom line
is we don't give up many points. Our defense is based on stopping
the run with eight or nine guys in the box. It's just that our
offense is so high-powered that teams have to pass because we are
usually up 30 or 40 points in the fourth quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos didn't allow Atlanta to score an offensive touchdown
until the final three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept Chris Chandler confused with a lot of different
looks,'' Gordon said. ``The guys up front did a great job with the
pressure. We got some tipped balls, and they (the Falcons) made
some bad decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the Falcons' bad decisions was not to sign Gordon, who
was interested in joining Coach Dan Reeves in free agency. But they
didn't make a big run at him.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos linebacker Bill Romanowski thinks players on the
Broncos' no-name defense might become famous after Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon had the best game with his two interceptions and 108
return yards, a Super Bowl record.
</P>
<P>
   ``People all over the world watch this game, from Africa to
Europe to Asia and all over,'' he said. ``There's a billion people
watching. It's a great feeling. It feels just as sweet as last
year.'' &QL;

FAN, COPS SCUFFLE  
 GUN-TOTING SPECTATOR SUBDUED AT OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ. - A sunny day at the Phoenix Open turned scary
Sunday when a gun-packing fan was arrested after a scuffle with a
Scottsdale police officer on the hole Tiger Woods was playing.
</P>
<P>
   The fracas developed at the TPC of Scottsdale's sixth hole
moments after the leaders _ Rocco Mediate, Woods and Harrison
Frazar _ had teed off during Sunday's final round.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders walked within 5 yards of the arrest scene as it was
developing.
</P>
<P>
   Arrested on suspicion of aggravated assault on a police officer,
a felony, and disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor, was Brian K.
Murphy of Phoenix, who was carrying in his fanny pack a gun for
which he had a permit.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, 40, was detained briefly in the Scottsdale Municipal
Jail and released Sunday evening. He was not charged, but the case
will be reviewed by the Maricopa County Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale police Officer Robert Rucker, who arrested Murphy,
said, ``I told the fan to be quiet, and he said, `I've got a gun,
too,' and squared off on me.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident began with a spectator yelling obnoxiously,
``Tiger, Tiger, Tiger . . .'' moments before Woods teed off. The
gallery was relatively small at that point, as the sixth hole is at
the farthest point on the course from the TPC's clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The police officer raised his palms, and the spectator raised
his. Then the man dropped his right hand and grabbed the officer.
They both tumbled over the ropes, where Murphy pulled Rucker's
jacket over the officer's head.
</P>
<P>
   That brought another Scottsdale police officer and an unknown
fan following the action into the fight, as they subdued Murphy and
handcuffed him. Another officer came to the scene to restrain
Murphy's wife, whose name was not given.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Artigue, tournament chairman for the Thunderbirds, the host
organization, said, ``It's very, very unfortunate when people like
that act out their emotions with this type of behavior. I'm
thankful it ended without serious consequence. It's impossible to
control every individual when you're playing host to over 400,000
fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad news is, it happened near Tiger's group. The good news
was, security was there to make the apprehension.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Dirren, a Scottsdale Police Department spokesman, said that
a gun was found in Murphy's fanny pack, but he did have a permit to
carry it. He also confirmed that Murphy appeared to be intoxicated
when he was placed under arrest at 12:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have since found out that (Murphy) had been causing a
disturbance for approximately four holes,'' Dirren said.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Woods expressed surprise that the fan had a gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoa!'' said Woods, who finished third in the tournament won
by Mediate.
</P>
<P>
   Woods added that it was the second incident in which an armed
fan, or fans, had gotten onto a course where he was playing. The
first time came during a junior tournament five or six years ago,
when two women in Dallas approached him with guns in their
backpacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might come to the point where it might be like a high
school, where you have to have metal detectors in order to go in,''
Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   Mediate also expressed concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``The policeman that was following us told him, `Watch your
mouth,' '' Mediate said. ``And (the fan) pushed him. That's a big
mistake. (The police officer) put him on the ground. It scared the
heck out of me. I just wanted to get away.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mediate was even more concerned when he was told Murphy was
carrying a gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, great! He had a gun?'' Mediate said. ``It's just a
game.'' &QL;

WHAT'S A BOULDER BETWEEN GOLFERS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN, TIM TYERS  
 and JOHN DAVIS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ. - A loose impediment is in the eye of the
beholder. It can be a leaf, a worm casing, a cigarette butt.
</P>
<P>
   Or . . . it can even be a half-ton rock, as golf fans across the
nation learned on CBS' national telecast of the Phoenix Open on
Sunday, when nine fans came out of the gallery to remove a large
boulder that was obstructing  &UR; Tiger Woods' opportunity to hit his
second shot at the 13th green.
</P>
<P>
   ``A loose impediment is a loose impediment, no matter how big it
is,'' Woods said. ``A stone is a stone, whether it weights a ton or
a gram. I got a ruling from an official, who is in charge of
rulings. I asked his opinion and he gave his decision and I went
with it. If he had said, `No, you couldn't move it, then I wouldn't
have moved it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a shot to the left _ there was a one-foot gap where I
could go left of the stone and under a tree branch. But it was a
pretty big cut (shot), though.''
</P>
<P>
   On a day when a pistol-packing fan was arrested while following
Woods, winner &UR; Rocco
 &UR; Mediate and  &UR; Harrison Frazar, the case of the movable rock created
a brief firestorm, especially in the mind of CBS analyst  &UR; Ken
Venturi.
</P>
<P>
   Venturi thought the rock was embedded. He wondered aloud why, if
it were a loose impediment, did it leave a hole where it had been
resting?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was in that group,'' Venturi said, ``I would call him
(Woods) on it.''
</P>
<P>
   PGA Tour competition and rules official  &UR; Orlando Pope ruled that
the rock was not embedded and invoked case rule No. 23{, which
states, ``Stones of any size (not solidly embedded) are loose
impediments and may be removed, provided removal does not unduly
delay play.''
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, the rule book also reads spectators, caddies, fellow
competitors, etc., can assist a player in removing a large loose
impediment.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ben Nelson, PGA Tournament director, said Pope made the correct
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at the area where the rock had been sitting and it
was a level surface with no indentation,'' Nelson said. ``Tiger was
very lucky that there were a number of people in the gallery who
were willing to move it for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, PGA Tour officials received numerous phone calls
during the telecast from irate viewers, claiming the ruling showed
favoritism and Woods should have been disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' second shot was bunkered beside the green, but he blasted
out and made birdie on the hole, moving to 8-under. &QL; 
Kaboom &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It figured that on a weird day featuring pistols and movable
boulders, that Scottsdale's
 &UR; Phil Mickelson would implode.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson started the day at 2-over and made the turn even, then
double-bogeyed No. 10, bogeyed No. 12, triple-bogeyed the par-3 No.
14, birdied No. 15 only to double-bogey No. 16. He finished with an
80, 11 over for the tournament, and tied for 61st.
</P>
<P>
   The top finishes by local golfers went to Paradise
Valley's &UR; Andrew Magee and Ahwatukee's &UR; 
 &UR; Mark Calcavecchia, who tied for 26th at 3 over. Sunnyslope's
 &UR; Jonathan Kaye tied for 33rd at 4 over, while Phoenix's &UR; Tom Purtzer
tied for 49th at 7 over.
</P>
<P>
   Tour rookie  &UR; Ted Purdy of Scottsdale finished 13 over, tied for
64th, while  &UR; Kirk Triplett of Scottsdale tied for 69th at 15 over. &QL;

PARTY BIRDS FLOCK TO NEST AT TPC  
 DRINKERS, DANCERS AND SMOKERS HAVE A BLAST UNDER THE CIRCUS TENT

<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ. - Before the sun went down each day, the party
was in high gear at the Bird's Nest.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour's biggest party lured many people to the grounds of
the TPC of Scottsdale _ forget the golf. They were here to see and
be seen at the hippest watering hole in the Valley, if only for
five days of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Phoenix Open crowd fell about 45,000 from 1998, no
drop-off of any kind was registered at the jampacked site. The Nest
has a reputation as the best party on the tour, and it lived up to
that reputation last week.
</P>
<P>
   Men in golf shirts and Dockers fired up cigars on the patio and
knocked back beers, occasionally taking calls on their cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   The party uniform for women was jeans, tall shoes and tight
tops. The motto on one woman's shirt said it all: ``Got wine?''
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, the Nest isn't much for ambience. Its home is a
circus-size tent covering a slab of concrete near the clubhouse at
the Tournament Players Club of Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the hottest party in town. I've been going since it was
at the Phoenix Country Club,'' Sherie Jacobs of Waddell said.
</P>
<P>
   She and Kim Nguy, 26, of Chandler, shivered on the patio and
watched the people one night during the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Watched people do what?
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting drunk. Getting wild,'' Nguy said.
</P>
<P>
   At dinnertime, people already wanted to hit the dance floor.
They weren't particular about the music. They just wanted to jump
around, and soon the area in front of the stage looked like
Woodstock with golf shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a good time. People come here and cut loose,'' said
Tim Welch, 42, of Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   You knew a party was on when men who can't dance wanted to
anyway. Their wives and girlfriends rolled their eyes, laughed, and
tried to anticipate their mates' next moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environment here is just nicer than a bar because everyone
is friendly and out to have a good time. It's innocent fun,'' said
Carrie Stewart, 21, a student at Arizona State University.
</P>
<P>
   Duck Soup, a cover band with a Doobie Brothers look-alike on
guitar and a Drew-Carey-without-hair singer, was the house band.
There was a big cheer when they bounced onto the stage and started
pounding out old faves like ``Wooly Bully'' and ``Honky Tonk''
``Women''.
</P>
<P>
   A woman leapt onto the stage and danced so suggestively next to
the singer that he and security didn't have the heart to kick her
off, at least until the end of the song.
</P>
<P>
   Even John O'Hurley, who played J. Peterman on the ``Seinfeld''
television show and now appears in ads for Xerox and the Travel
Channel, got into the act. Introduced to the crowd during a break,
he received a huge cheer when he said, ``Is this the greatest party
on Earth?''
</P>
<P>
   It was, except for the two women who took swings at each other.
Friends intervened; no damage was done.
</P>
<P>
   People forgot the rules about smoking. They lit up in the tent,
mixing cigar and cigarette smoke with sweat from the roiling,
jammed crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't mind the `jampackedness' of it,'' said Carly
Ullinskey, 21, another ASU student. ``You can go in and dance for a
while, then come out and cool off.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, a couple of Scottsdale police officers who arrived
early on their horses held the reins of their mounts.
</P>
<P>
   Both are Nest veterans of about 10 years, and they said the
crowd used to be much wilder before Open organizers set up the
high-profile police presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we weren't here, there would be more problems,'' officer
Kirk Toth said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have been drinking on the course,'' officer Bill
Yedowitz said. ``By the end of the day, they're hammered. They
don't know when to quit. But overall, it's pretty good.'' &QL;

<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ. - Tiger Woods, with the help of some newfound
friends, managed to move a half-ton rock on Sunday, but golf's
youngest living legend couldn't budge a guy named Rocco by himself.
</P>
<P>
   Woods was left wondering what might have been after finishing
the 72-hole Phoenix Open grind at 8 under and in third place
Sunday, with Rocco Mediate holding the $540,000 winner's check.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't supposed to be that way. Mediate played back-to-back
rounds in the same pairing with Woods, whose booming drives and
pin-splitting irons have reduced bigger-named foes to mush in
head-to-head competition.
</P>
<P>
   Mediate not only withstood Tiger's presence, he outscored him,
137 to 138, over the two-day, 36-hole match-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of opportunities, especially from holes 10 through
14, where I could have had four straight birdies,'' Woods said.
``But I didn't do that, so I didn't put the pressure on him that I
needed to by playing with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt if I could put some heat on him with him having to
watch me, it could have been a different story. Rocco outplayed me.
More importantly, he outputted everybody. He made a lot of big
putts. I played with him Saturday and he made a few bombs. He hung
in tough today and, deservedly, won the championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Mediate, it turns out, is your unflappable sort, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rocco is Rocco,'' Woods said, smiling. ``Rocco doesn't change.
Whether he's shooting 80 or 60, he's still the same.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but Mediate, who started the day with a 6-shot lead over
Woods, admitted his comfort zone was more strained Sunday than it
was on Saturday against Woods. He said his case of early nerves
caused him to spend much of the front side scrambling to save par
en route to a two-bogey, two-birdie round of par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to shoot something under par on the front nine to get
a little closer to him and make it more realistic on the back
nine,'' Woods said. ``Because of the way he was putting, and the
way he has been driving, all he needed to do is right the ship _
and, boom _ he's going to make a couple of birdie putts, which he
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good birdie chance on Number 1 and lipped the cup. I
horseshoed a putt for birdie on Number 3. I had a few chances
early. I could have been 2-under after three with a chance to get
something going real quick, but I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, one of Woods' three birdies came on No. 13, after he
hit his drive left and behind a half-ton rock. A tournament
official ruled the boulder a loose impediment, and nine members of
the gallery were enlisted to move it. Woods hit his second shot
into a bunker, anyway, but managed to make birdie from the sand.
</P>
<P>
   It was the putter that failed Woods. In addition to wasting the
two birdie chances on the front side, he missed a 4-foot birdie
putt on No. 13 and wasted a must-birdie situation on the par-five
No. 15 when he hit a poor chip and then missed a 12-foot birdie
putt. He backed that up by missing another 12-footer for birdie on
No. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit the ball good. There's nothing you can do about it,''
Woods said of his day on the edge of the cup. ``You have to keep
believing in yourself. You're hitting good putts. I'm hitting the
putts on line. It's not like I'm having bad speed, the putts are
burning the edge. It's part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played as hard as I possibly could today. I went at it, gave
it everything I had, and, unfortunately, it wasn't enough. I didn't
make the key putts when I had to, or hit the ball close enough on
certain opportunities. But I can't say it was a lack of effort. I
wanted to win this tournament. I want to win every tournament.'' &QL;

MONEY MOTIVES ALWAYS PURE, NASH MAINTAINS  
 GUARD SOUGHT `BALLPARK' DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - When the report first came out of Dallas, it was an
eye-opener in Phoenix. According to those reports, point guard
Steve Nash had agreed to a six-year contract extension for $18
million with the Dallas Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   While that's nothing to sneeze at, it was far less than the Suns
had been told it would take to keep Nash during negotiations for an
extension before last summer's NBA draft. There were reports that
Nash and agent Bill Duffy were seeking a contract that would
average $8 million a season.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns, believing they would be unable to keep Nash when he
became a free agent this summer, traded him to Dallas for the
rights to Notre Dame's Pat Garrity, a couple of players and an
unconditional 1999 first-round draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, General Manager Bryan Colangelo and Coach Danny
Ainge said Nash wanted to be paid starter's money and play
starter's minutes. And with Jason Kidd as the franchise
centerpiece, that wasn't going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   So they pulled the trigger on a deal rather than risk losing
Nash for no compensation _ just as the Minnesota Timberwolves lost
Tom Gugliotta to Phoenix and the Suns lost Antonio McDyess to the
Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Nash has his own team, the Mavericks, who visit America
West Arena tonight for the final exhibition game for both teams.
After this tuneup, the Suns open the 50-game, lockout-shortened
regular season Friday in Los Angeles against the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   And as it turns out, Nash got that starter's money, too. The
initial reports were wrong. Nash signed for about $33 million over
those six years.
</P>
<P>
   But Nash believes there are some misconceptions about his
motives. He insists he wasn't looking to break the bank, and he
certainly did not expect to replace Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said, financially, I had to look out for my best
interests,'' Nash said. ``They had to be in the same ballpark as
what other teams would offer, but I never said I wanted my own
team. I was happy to compromise my career if what I was paid was in
the ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   And he insists it wasn't an $8 million ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand things can get misconstrued,'' he said. ``I think
my agent said the number needed to be between five and eight
(million dollars), but it depended on the team. If I was going to
Vancouver, then it had to be closer to eight.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because, as a Canadian citizen, Nash would have taken a
big tax hit in Vancouver, which is in his home province of British
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The money, to Nash, isn't as big an issue as the idea that he
had to have his own team to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never said anything about it being my team or having my own
team,'' he said. ``People understand that we only have so many
years to play and earn money. But I didn't say I needed to run my
own team. I was ready to sacrifice that part to stay in Phoenix.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Nash figures the Suns couldn't justify paying a
backup point guard more than $5 million a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand it,'' he said. ``They probably didn't want to pay
that much for a second-team point guard. They had plans to go out
and sign free agents, and even though I wouldn't have counted on
the (salary) cap, the organization still has to pay that money.''
</P>
<P>
   Nash probably feels at times as if he never left, anyway. There
are four other former Suns on the Dallas roster, including Cedric
Ceballos, A.C. Green, John ``Hot Rod'' Williams and Michael Finley.
</P>
<P>
   Green and Finley were traded to the Mavericks as part of the
deal that brought Kidd to the Suns. Ceballos was traded last
February to Dallas for Dennis Scott and re-signed as a free agent
last week. The Suns renounced the rights to Williams, who signed as
a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   And Dallas assistant coach Donn Nelson, son of head
Coach/General Manager Don Nelson, is a former assistant to Suns
Coach Danny Ainge. In a move patterned after what the Suns did
first with Paul Westphal and later with Ainge, the younger Nelson
already has been designated as the club's next head coach.
</P>
<P>
   At a morning shootaround before Saturday's exhibition game
between the two teams, Donn Nelson said, ``It was like being at a
yearbook signing party.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson has even said that he hopes to model the Dallas
franchise after the Suns organization and utilize the climate and
improved quality of the franchise to attract future free agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need a few more 100-degree days and a lot more golf
courses to do that,'' Ceballos said, smiling. ``Obviously, the
organization is a plus in Phoenix, but it's the whole area. The
whole town is focused on the Suns. Even with the Cardinals,
Diamondbacks and Coyotes, the focus is mostly on the Suns. The town
closes when the Suns play, and whether they're winning or losing,
they sell out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came back to Phoenix from the Lakers, they were in that
0-13 streak and the place was still sold out. That support is a big
key for players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time I ever heard them boo a player was Kevin Johnson
in the (1993) Finals. Maybe one other guy. I think they booed (Dan)
Majerle once. In other stadiums, players get booed all the time. I
know they booed Tom Gugliotta in Minnesota after they traded for
him, and he ended up being an All-Star for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd has been on the other side, in Dallas, which has the
league's longest current playoff drought _ eight years without a
postseason appearance. But Kidd believes the Mavericks are close to
turning the corner to respectability.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got enough talent to beat anybody,'' he said.
``Michael Finley is one of the best two guards in the league, and
Steve is an up-and-coming point guard. He will have to feel his way
for awhile. It's a lot different when you have the reins to
yourself. But I know he's going to do quite well. The people in
Dallas have a great point guard to watch for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Nash said he saw himself playing a long time for the Suns, but
he's found a new home in Dallas. The trade, he said, has worked out
well for both sides
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worked out great. I really like all my teammates. It's
been easy because there are so many familiar faces. It's been a
good move. I miss my teammates in Phoenix, but there is no looking
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel really good about this team. I don't want to make any
predictions, but I think with some time and maturity, we can be
good with the talent and youth we have.'' &QL;

RONNING PUTS HEART INTO UPSTART PREDATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ When he got traded here on Halloween for future
considerations,  &UR; Cliff
 &UR; Ronning admitted he was crushed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure I was. I used to eat and breathe Coyotes,'' the veteran
center said. ``But I think you have to put your whole heart into a
team like that or you won't be the best you can be.''
</P>
<P>
   He's doing the same thing now with the expansion Nashville
Predators, and thanks largely in part to him, the first-year club
has a legitimate chance to make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes, who for whatever reason didn't think he was the
answer anymore, aren't only headed toward the postseason but are
viewed by many as a Stanley Cup contender. Ronning, however, isn't
upset about not being along for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a jealous person,'' he said. ``It's kind of funny,
actually. I'm happy for a lot of the players there. I've become
close with some of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an adjustment here, but it's been fun to come to a
team that works hard. It's a young team and I'm the oldest guy. But
everything's an experience. There's reasons why I'm here and I feel
I belong.''
</P>
<P>
   The Predators are about to keep him around awhile longer, too.
During the next few days, they are expected to announce they have
re-signed Ronning for another two to three years. &QL; 
JR and TD &QL; 
The Coyotes were giving center  &UR; Jeremy Roenick a hard time before
the game after it was learned he and Denver Broncos running back
 &UR; Terrell Davis were on the same betting board at the Imperial
Palace. The bet: Would Roenick score more points against Nashville
than Davis scores touchdowns against the Atlanta Falcons in
Sunday's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got two today, but I'd say it's going to be pretty close to
a push here,'' Roenick said, laughing. ``I think TD could have a
big night, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Roenick won the line, as Davis failed to score during Denver's
Super Bowl victory. &QL; 
You again?
</P>
<P>
   When the Coyotes acquired defenseman  &UR; J.J. Daigneault from the
Predators, the first team he faced was Nashville. Sunday marked he
second time in eight games he went up against his former teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time, it was pretty emotional,'' Daigneault said.
``This time, it was just taking care of business and trying to play
solid, defensively. Toward the end, after we had a three-goal lead,
I think I got a little bit overconfident and I wanted to
stickhandle a little bit too much.''
</P>
<P>
   He also almost got into a scrum with ex-teammate  &UR; Drew
Berehowsky. &QL;

`JAM' MAKES TOAST OF PREDA TORS  
 FORECHECKING COYOTES SPREAD IT ON THICKLY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NASHVILLE - Jam.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it's not just something you put on toast or spread
on a piece of bread opposite peanut butter. It's also a catch word
Coyotes assistant coach John Tortorella likes to use when talking
about about his hockey team. It means ``hard hockey,'' Tortorella
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, after playing mostly like jelly on this four-game
road trip, the Coyotes showed plenty of jam in their 5-1 rout of
the expansion Nashville Predators.
</P>
<P>
   They jammed so much, in fact, they could have jumped on stage at
any one of the country joints that line the streets outside
Nashville Arena. They turned honky tonk into hockey tonk and then
quickly left Music City like a headline act on a world tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed this,'' Tortorella said. ``We needed to get back
into a workman's-type effort, get back into our forechecking and
start playing with some jam, start competing. That's what we kept
talking about before the game.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a short-handed goal by Nashville's Greg Johnson midway
through the first period to drive the point home. After that, the
Coyotes (25-12-9) simply overpowered their first-year competitors,
burying them with five straight goals, including a deflection by
rookie Trevor Letowski just 50 seconds after Johnson's score.
</P>
<P>
   Left wing Keith Tkachuk, who drew the ire of the Predators
(18-27-4) with a quote he'd like to take back about guaranteeing a
victory, led the assault with a goal and two assists, his third
three-point game of the season and his first since Nov. 24 against
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Center Jeremy Roenick pitched in with a goal and an assist and
set the tempo, especially on the forecheck, by registering nine
official hits in the second period alone. The Coyotes also got
goals from Jyrki Lumme and Rick Tocchet and two assists from rookie
center Daniel Briere, who has four points in his past three games
since rumors began to surface the team might be searching for a
veteran playmaker.
</P>
<P>
   After getting embarrassed here a few weeks ago, 2-0, in a game
in which they showed no jam whatsoever, the Coyotes almost seemed
to be toying with the Predators by the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when you have a nice win, the next game you're a
little more relaxed,'' Tocchet said. ``And I think this team just
needs to relax a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   So do the Predators, who were coming off impressive road wins
over Eastern Conference powers Buffalo and New Jersey, whom they
beat the previous night in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make excuses, but the puck was going in pretty easy
for them,'' said former Coyotes center Cliff Ronning, Nashville's
leading scorer. ``We were only in the game during the first period,
maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing without wingers Dallas Drake (bruised shoulder), Brad
Isbister (groin pull) and Jim Cummins (suspension), the Coyotes
were down to 10 forwards after rookie Tavis Hansen went to the box
for a fighting major. No problem. A defenseman came to the rescue
as Lumme flipped in a goal past Tomas Vokoun, who got the start
because No. 1 goalie Mike Dunham was in nets the previous day.
</P>
<P>
   It was Lumme's first goal in 23 games. About eight minutes
later, Tocchet scored his third in five games, the 401st of his
career. Roenick got one of the assists, his 100th in a Phoenix
uniform since his trade two years ago from Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk scored his 19th less than two minutes into the third on
what looked to be an illegal two-line pass from Keith Carney,
making it 4-1. Roenick finished things with a fist-pumping snap
shot, his 17th, at 16:01.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we needed as a team,'' Tkachuk said. ``We
were struggling in our last bunch of games. . . . We needed a win,
period. I don't care how we got it, as long as we got it.''
</P>
<P>
   They did it with jam, something you can find on a supermarket
shelf and now, again on one of the elite teams in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``After they scored the short-handed goal, we started getting
into the game and working them down low,'' Tortorella said.
``That's our game, forechecking, and we've been missing that. It
came a little bit on the Island (in New York during a 4-4 tie
Friday with the Islanders) and we brought it into this game today.
It's a nice way to go home.'' &QL;

GUN WILL CHANGE IMAGE OF OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ. - The implications are terrifying:
</P>
<P>
   A man with slurred speech waiting on the sixth tee box for Tiger
Woods, shouting his name. A man becoming indignant with a police
officer. A man bragging that he is carrying a firearm. A man
arrested after a wrestling match with the police.
</P>
<P>
   A man who, upon further inspection, was indeed carrying a
concealed weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're kidding me,'' Phil Mickelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Nope.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very, very scary,'' John Daly said. ``Some people think
we're babies about what is going on at No. 16. Well, it's because
we're scared. We're worried.''
</P>
<P>
   The darkest fear of any athlete surfaced Sunday at the Phoenix
Open, a vulnerability that can be exposed by any fruitcake with a
pistol.
</P>
<P>
   It evoked memories of Monica Seles, once stabbed in the back
during a changeover in Germany, the target of a crazy fan looking
to help out Steffi Graf. It was reminiscent of the lunatic from
Cleveland who drove to Florida in search of slugger Albert Belle,
who had left the Indians and signed with the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   And suddenly the Thunderbirds have a new problem:
</P>
<P>
   Metal detectors under the bridge? A complete ban on alcohol
sales? Bulletproof vests for the golfers? A tournament without
fans?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we are making no assumptions, no accusations of
grassy knolls or assassination plots. The man arrested, Brian K.
Murphy of Phoenix, had a permit for his firearm, making its
presence perfectly legal. But . . .
</P>
<P>
   Who in the hell carries a gun to the golf course?
</P>
<P>
   Before he met with the media, before he was prepped by security
guards concerned about the image of the TPC, Woods was asked what
he saw on the sixth tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy who got into some kind of scuffle,'' Woods said. ``He
had a few cocktails, from what I heard.''
</P>
<P>
   A guy with a gun stashed in his fanny pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' he said in disbelief. ``I didn't know it wasthat
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   This from a man of multiethnic descent who has complained of
death threats in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still get them,'' Woods said with remarkable calm.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time a fan with a firearm has been
arrested in the vicinity of Woods. It happened in Dallas five or
six years ago, when Woods was an amateur playing a practice round
by himself. Two women were arrested with guns in their backpacks,
on their way to where Woods was practicing.
</P>
<P>
   Some day, the rough edges of society will get a clue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are definitely some crazy people out there,'' Payne
Stewart said. ``And there is a black and white issue out there.
It's sad, but it's the way it is. As I understand it, Tiger has had
some death threats before, which is why he has so many security
guards.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, racism is an issue, and when it comes to harmony and
acceptance of all colors, well, it's no secret that Arizona still
has a faction of the Wild West militia living inside its borders.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this could happen anywhere. But the image of the
Phoenix Open will prevail over all logic, and the raucous
atmosphere that makes the tournament so fun will now be a matter of
serious debate. More than 422,000 people attended the Phoenix Open.
Because of one idiot, there will likely be substantial changes in
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done some crazy things when I was drunk,'' Daly said.
``It's because of alcohol. People do stupid things when they're
drunk. And that's why it's so scary. All it should take is one
incident to make them a little more protective of our safety.''
</P>
<P>
   That incident has occurred, soiling a wonderful weekend of drama
at the TPC. A weekend when the 16th hole rocked with harmless
celebration. When a course played like a major and a golfer named
Rocco Mediate challenged himself to greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a story about a man and a gun will make the rounds, and
some golfer may pass on this tournament in the future.
</P>
<P>
   A golfer no longer concerned about the noise. A golfer concerned
about his life.
</P>
<P>
   Coming back, Tiger?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   So long, Tiger. And the Phoenix Open as we know it. &QL;

LOUDMOUTH SPARKS FIRE IN MEDIATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ. - Coming down the stretch of the 64th Phoenix
Open on Sunday, Rocco Mediate was starting to fade into the
afternoon haze. The easygoing Italian-American was 1 over for the
day, and the footsteps by Justin Leonard and Tiger Woods were
echoing in his ears.
</P>
<P>
   So were the words from the loud mouth of a fan, who had just
made the mistake of giving Rocco the incentive he needed to right
what looked like a ship sinking fast.
</P>
<P>
   On the par-3 12th green, Tiger was eyeing a short birdie putt,
and Mediate's 6-shot lead at the start of the final round was on
the verge of vanishing like a mirage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm walking up there (to the 12th green), and this guy from
the gallery _ and I saw him say it _ said, `Knock it in, Tiger. If
you do, Rocco will fold like a cheap suit,' '' Mediate related.
``Well, that (ticked) me off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walk over towards him and I pointed at him and (said), `Will
I fold like a cheap suit?' Well, I almost made the putt (for
birdie-2), and he says it again. If there wasn't water there
(around the green), I would have had to go after him. I was so
mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Mediate got even on the next hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just roasted it off the 13th tee, hit a 2-iron just short,
pitched up to four feet and made my first birdie of the day,'' he
said. ``That got me going. I guess I should get mad every morning
when I come out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mediate's mood had come full circle by the time he was presented
the $540,000 winner's check.
</P>
<P>
   Although his par 71 Sunday had been shaky from the get-go,
Mediate had survived 36 holes of playing with Woods and his rowdy
fan club, good for a 2-shot victory over Leonard _ 3 shots in front
of Woods.
</P>
<P>
   As testament to a much tougher course, Mediate's 11-under 273
was the highest winning total at the TPC since Lee Janzen won by
the same number in 1993. It also added up to his third career
victory, and his first since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   A straightforward guy, Mediate made no bones about his
less-than-stellar play Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger, if he makes any putts, I'm not sitting here,'' said
Mediate, who seems to be back on track after a back injury in 1993
got his career going sideways.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, however, did putt exceptionally well, as his closing 66
matched the best round of the week. For his efforts, the
straight-shooting Texan received $324,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little different this year, but it was nice to get up
to the 16th tee and they were actually pulling for me,'' said
Leonard, who felt the wrath of the fans during a playoff with Phil
Mickelson in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't surprised to see Rocco play solid. I mean he's got
kind of a laid-back attitude and seems pretty relaxed. He's won
golf tournaments before, even though I'm sure he had some jitters
(today).''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who missed birdie putt after birdie putt, said he
``played as hard as I possibly could play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my chances,'' said Woods, who collected $204,000 after
posting 68.
</P>
<P>
   Some might say that Woods got more than his fair share of
breaks, including getting a boulder moved at the 13th hole that led
to a birdie that some fans perceived as unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the ruling, and the official told me it was a loose
impediment,'' said Woods of the rule (23{ in the Rules of Golf).
``I trust (the officials), and I had a shot to the left of the
boulder, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   To say this was a weird day _ a gun-packing fan also was
arrested on the sixth tee after scuffling with a Scottsdale police
officer _ would be an understatement. But boulders and guns aside,
Rocco was not the rock Sunday that he had been during the second
and third rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got here (Sunday morning), I called my wife and said,
`I don't feel real comfortable,' '' said the 36-year-old from Ponte
Vedra, Fla. ``I didn't sleep good (Saturday night) for the first
time ever, because I always sleep good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had this feeling. You can get going a little funny here
and you're 3 over just like that.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, he was 1 over at the turn and looking in his
rear-view mirror at Leonard, who had started the day 7 shots back,
and Woods, who was 6 off the pace.
</P>
<P>
   But the incident at the 12th started the fire burning. Mediate
turned to his caddie, Pete Bender, and said, ``Nothing is ever
easy. Let's go. We have plenty of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The birdie at the 13th helped, but he came right back with ``my
worst shot of the tournament'' at the 14th that dumped him in a
bunker and led to a bogey. At that point, Leonard was 2 shots back,
and Woods was 3.
</P>
<P>
   The final turning point, he said, came at the notorious par-3
16th, where his 8-iron slid over the back edge of the green, inches
from rolling down a steep incline. From there, he knocked his first
putt from the fringe eight feet past the cup but holed it coming
back for a knee-knocking par.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixteen was the whole tournament, the whole day for me,'' he
said. ``When I walked up there (for the second putt), and Tiger had
just missed again (for birdie), I told Pete, `That's enough. I'm
just knocking this in right now,' and I made it.''
</P>
<P>
   A 2-putt birdie from 120 feet at the 17th didn't hurt his
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``A million miles away,'' Mediate said of the length of the
first putt. ``But the 16th hole let me birdie 17. I miss that putt
at 16, I probably don't birdie 17.''
</P>
<P>
   His ``most relaxing swing of the week'' came at No. 18, where
Mediate's 3-wood split the fairway, about 75 yards behind Woods'
monster drive. It didn't matter, as Rocco made a routine 2-putt par
to cap a wild and wonderful week.
</P>
<P>
   No hard feelings, either, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans were great, and Tiger was great about it,'' Mediate
said of the verbal shelling he faced over the past two days. ``He
said many times, `Oh, don't listen. Shake that off.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew they weren't doing it because they don't like me. They
just want Tiger to win, which is how it's going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not next year. Winning the Phoenix Open, or even coming
close, has its advantages. Just ask Leonard, who has experienced
both sides of its split personality.

BEST WAY FOR ELWAY TO GO WOULD BE WHILE HE'S NO. 1 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI - It isn't easy to say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Few athletes can make themselves walk away from the cheers at
the height of their careers, and Sunday night No. 7 stood on top of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Broncos had won another Super Bowl. Thanks to John
Elway, the contest wasn't even close.
</P>
<P>
   At 38, under a full moon that seemed to shine just for him, the
oldest quarterback to start an NFL championship game put an
exclamation point on his remarkable career. Elway's Most Valuable
Player performance in Denver's 34-19 victory surprised the Atlanta
Falcons and maybe even himself.
</P>
<P>
   This was his game. His night. His finest moment.
</P>
<P>
   Elway upstaged KISS. He outdid Cher. Stevie Wonder. Gloria
Estefan. Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, which it turns out, isn't one
person, but an eight-member swing band.
</P>
<P>
   Elway made even bigger news than Eugene Robinson who was
arrested the night before the big game for allegedly requesting a
personal favor from an undercover police officer in high heels.
This isn't Washington. This is the ``Super Bowl.'' Eugene, WHAT
WERE YOU THINKING?
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's embarrassment was magnified, if that's possible, when
Elway beat him deep, throwing an 80-yard touchdown pass that did in
the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Denver won the Super Bowl almost in spite of Elway.
This time Elway ``led'' the way.
</P>
<P>
   This was the old John Elway, at his best. Of his five Super
Bowls, this had to be the sweetest because he played like a Hall of
Famer and Dan Reeves had to watch.
</P>
<P>
   If last year was about redemption, this was about going out and
having fun and sticking it to his former coach.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about gratifying. Elway kept completing passes, right and
left. The Broncos kept moving up and down the field. The Falcons
couldn't stop them. Reeves must have experienced flashbacks.
Earlier in the week the former Denver coach talked about Elway's
ability, in his younger years, to work magic. To turn what Reeves
thought were bad decisions into winning plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you all the times I thought ``No, no, no . . .
then yes, yes yes!'' Reeves said of Elway when they were together.
Over time they grew apart. The Falcons coach may have set a Super
Bowl record on this night for no, no, no's.
</P>
<P>
   Elway did everything except engineer another signature
fourth-quarter comeback. He didn't need to _ this game was over
long before then.
</P>
<P>
   The only suspense was waiting for the game to end so Elway could
be asked about his future. Will he walk away with two Super Bowl
titles and the MVP trophy in his arms? Why not? The timing is
absolutely perfect.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not easy closing the book. It wasn't for Joe Montana
even when he knew it was time to say goodbye. At 38 and past his
prime, the quarterback who led the 49ers to four Super Bowl
victories made it official at a public gathering. ``I never thought
the day would come,'' Montana said, ``when I would say the word
`retirement.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``One more year!'' fans chanted, like delegates at a political
rally, trying to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately,'' Joe said, ``it's here.''
</P>
<P>
   Few can walk away as Rocky Marciano did. Keeping a promise to
his wife, the former heavyweight champ quit when he was ahead, 49
wins, no losses. Michael Jordan left the stage with the applause
ringing in his ears, the crowd on its feet crying, ``More . . .
more . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Elway is the MJ of Denver. He is that city's most beloved
citizen. He could run for mayor and win. When Rod Smith, who caught
Elway's game-breaking pass, came to the Mile High City, the first
thing he noticed was that Elway was everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was driving down a street and saw John Elway (car)
dealerships,'' Smith recalled. ``I thought, `He runs this part of
town.' Then I went north where I bought my truck and there were
more dealerships and I thought, `This guy runs the whole town.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Elway has done it all. He holds the all-time record for late
comebacks. He has won more games than any quarterback in history.
</P>
<P>
   He is 38. He missed five games this year because of nagging
injuries. Sore back. Sore hamstrings.
</P>
<P>
   Would you come back? Not me.
</P>
<P>
   Are you kidding? Not after this night.
</P>
<P>
   No way. &QL;

   BEIJING _ Shanghai's ``hot pot'' restaurants have come up with a
recipe for success that has unsuspecting customers soon coming back
for more.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation by the city's health authorities of 45 such
eateries found that 11 of them had added a little extra something _
opium poppy flowers _ to the broth.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, reported in the city's main newspaper, the Wenhui
Daily, said that customers eating the spiced-up hot pot would
experience ``numbness,'' feelings of incapacity, and illness.
</P>
<P>
   While this might seem unlikely to tempt back customers, the
newspaper claimed that the added special ingredient could prove
addictive. Shanghai health officials refused to comment on the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone out in search of Shanghai's hot pot buzz would have a lot
of eating to do, however, as only 15 of the 82 hot pots tested by
the authorities were found to contain the illicit poppies.
</P>
<P>
   Giving hot pot customers a little more than they ordered is not
new, but the newspaper said the test results showed a higher
proportion of opium poppy contamination than in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Hot pot is a traditional Chinese dish, along the lines of
fondue, where diners cook pieces of meat and vegetables in a
central boiling vat of spiced broth or oil.
</P>
<P>
   In a country which regularly still lambasts Britain and other
``imperialist powers'' for the 19th century ``Opium Wars,'' it is
all rather embarrassing. Growing opium poppies is banned, and every
year teams are sent out to investigate illegal poppy planting.
</P>
<P>
   After 1949, the Chinese government stamped out opium dens and
virtually rid the country of drugs, but in recent years the problem
has returned with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   China now has more than half a million registered drug addicts,
and last year police confiscated 2.5 tons of heroin and 325 kg.
tons of opium. The statistics do not record how many gallons of hot
pot soup were seized.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide anti-drugs campaign recently toured the country
with the theme ``Yes to Life, No to Drugs.'' Shanghai may soon be
host to a new public information blitz: ``Yes to Hot Pot, No to
Opium.'' &QL;

   CHICAGO _ Venture inside the Merchandising Mart in downtown
Chicago, a 1930's Art Deco monolith so large that it has a postal
code all of its own, and you will get an instant glimpse of the
state of the economy in the city and beyond across the American
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Powered by strong consumer confidence, it continues to boom.
</P>
<P>
   True, there are areas of weakness. Farming is in crisis in the
region, largely because of collapsing hog prices. And an
unemployment rate that dipped to a meager 3.6 percent in the
Midwest last year means that finding qualified workers has become a
nightmare for many employers.
</P>
<P>
   But the plenitude of jobs coupled with low interest rates,
negligible inflation and high stock prices continues to deliver
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing bearish, for example, about the mood at Russ
Berrie and Company, America's best-known teddy bear wholesaler,
which has a permanent showroom for the retail trade in the Mart.
</P>
<P>
   A new high-end product line of ``Vintage Bears'' launched just
this month was sold out within two weeks. Each bear sells at retail
for $30 or more. Business in the showroom is up 1,000 percent over
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers have walked in a placed orders for $30,000 on the
spot,'' reports Geoffrie Cerese, director of sales, who says a
strong retail performance over Christmas explains the rush. ``Since
the new year, business has been rocketing. What is amazing is that
we would sell so many of these bears so quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   One floor below Russ Berrie is Smartrooms Inc., a supplier of
custom cabinetry for kitchens and bathrooms. Its business is
benefiting from an explosion of new-home sales across the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brutally swamped,'' is the best description Smartrooms vice
president, James Livingston, can offer for the state of his
business right now.
</P>
<P>
   How long can it last? ``You have to reach a saturation point and
I can kind of foresee that,'' he replies, warning that one day
there will be more new homes than people to live in them. ``But I
think we have probably got another three years left. I sure hope
so.''
</P>
<P>
   The scramble by employers to find skilled workers may soon
become critical, however, which in turn could spell pressure on
wages and a new inflation risk.
</P>
<P>
   One Chicago-based bank, TCF National, revealed that it is even
sending scouts into city shopping malls. ``If we're being waited on
by somebody who's very good, like at a shoe store, we try to
recruit them,'' said a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   For recruitment firms, like Esquire Staffing Group with offices
in downtown Chicago, it means the pressure to find workers is
relentless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like this in the 40 years I've been
in the business,'' says Esquire Chief Executive Sherwin Fischer.
His consultants simply can't find enough people to fill all the
vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people are nervous wrecks and they don't dare take any
time off because they're making $2000 a day.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago he was predicting at least a slowdown during
1999, but now he is not so sure. ``Frankly, I don't see and end to
it.''

GENERAL CHALLENGE COULD BE SPECIAL
</HEADLINE>
 ERROR IN FIFTH GRAPH-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ When San Diego's John and Betty Mabee sold Del Mar
Futurity winner Worldly Manner to Dubai's Godolphin Stables for $5
million last fall, they said they were still confident of their
Kentucky Derby chances.
</P>
<P>
   Now we know why.
</P>
<P>
   The Mabees' General Challenge, who didn't even start racing
until Worldly Manner was overseas, is 3 for 3 after he and jockey
Gary Stevens won the 1 1/16-mile Santa Catalina Stakes at Santa
Anita on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And the California-bred gelding by General Meeting, out of
Excellent Lady, looks like a threat for longer distances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's kind of a special horse,'' said John Mabee, who
also has 3-year-old prospects in Finder's Gold and Excellent
Meeting, the latter a filly by General Meeting.
</P>
<P>
   From good striking range, Stevens challenged front-running Buck
Trout and Eddie Delahoussaye on the turn for home and pulled away
to win by three lengths in 1:42.93 on a track labeled ``good.''
</P>
<P>
   Buck Trout saved second from Brilliantly, who, like the winner,
is trained by Bob Baffert. Mr. Broad Blade and Charismatic
completed the order. Two horses were scratched after overnight
rain.
</P>
<P>
   This was General Challenge's first two-turn race and his first
against non-Cal-breds after wins in a 6-furlong maiden race Nov. 28
and the 7-furlong California Breeders' Champion Stakes Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a very, very special horse to run with him
the last quarter-mile,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge paid $3.60. Recent winners of the $106,500
Santa Catalina include Derby winner Ferdinand (1986) and Larry the
Legend ('95).
</P>
<P>
   Next on his schedule: the one-mile San Rafael on Feb. 28. The
1[-mile Santa Anita Derby on April 3 is the local prep for the
1\-mile Kentucky Derby on May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Would the Mabees sell?
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take a tremendous amount of money to buy him,'' John
Mabee said. ``He's not going anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a busy weekend for fans who scout Derby hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday, at Gulfstream Park near Miami, Louisiana product
Bet Me Best and jockey Jerry Bailey prevailed after a :21 3/5-:43
3/5 duel with Texas Glitter and John Velazquez in the 7-furlong
Hutcheson Stakes. Favored Cat Thief finished third.
</P>
<P>
   Bet Me Best, a stablemate of Belmont winner Victory Gallop, is 6
for 6 but paid a healthy $7 because he was stepping up to a graded
stakes.
</P>
<P>
   He was clocked in 1:22 1/5. Only Holy Bull (1:21 1/5, 1994) ran
a faster Hutcheson in the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, at the Fair Grounds in New Orleans, Breeders' Cup
Juvenile winner Answer Lively took a wide trip to seventh in the
Lecomte Handicap as Some Actor ($86.80) and Desert Demon (21-1) ran
1-2. It was Answer Lively's first start of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Eddie Delahoussaye pulled within two of 6,000 with a cool
win aboard Point Proven.... The Mandella barn said Bright Valour
was scratched from the Santa Catalina with swelling in his right
foreleg.... Late bloomer? Three-year-old Apremont ran away with his
debut in 1:08.76 for 6 furlongs on the fast Santa Anita mud. The
Ron McAnally-trained son of Silver Deputy left odds-on Treasure
Hunt a poor third.... Chris Antley plans a comeback with two mounts
Wednesday.... Next weekend: the Strub (Event of the Year, Run Man
Run, Dr. Fong) and the San Vicente (Exploit) on Saturday; the San
Antonio (Free House, Malek, Lord Grillo) and La Canada on Sunday.

   Powered by strong consumer confidence, it continues to boom.
</P>
<P>
   True, there are areas of weakness. Farming is in crisis in the
region, largely because of collapsing hog prices. And an
unemployment rate that dipped to a meager 3.6 percent in the
Midwest last year means that finding qualified workers has become a
nightmare for many employers.
</P>
<P>
   But the plenitude of jobs coupled with low interest rates,
negligible inflation and high stock prices continues to deliver
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing bearish, for example, about the mood at Russ
Berrie and Company, America's best-known teddy bear wholesaler,
which has a permanent showroom for the retail trade in the Mart.
</P>
<P>
   A new high-end product line of ``Vintage Bears'' launched just
this month was sold out within two weeks. Each bear sells at retail
for $30 or more. Business in the showroom is up 1,000 percent over
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers have walked in a placed orders for $30,000 on the
spot,'' reports Geoffrie Cerese, director of sales, who says a
strong retail performance over Christmas explains the rush. ``Since
the new year, business has been rocketing. What is amazing is that
we would sell so many of these bears so quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   One floor below Russ Berrie is Smartrooms Inc., a supplier of
custom cabinetry for kitchens and bathrooms. Its business is
benefiting from an explosion of new-home sales across the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brutally swamped,'' is the best description Smartrooms vice
president, James Livingston, can offer for the state of his
business right now.
</P>
<P>
   How long can it last? ``You have to reach a saturation point and
I can kind of foresee that,'' he replies, warning that one day
there will be more new homes than people to live in them. ``But I
think we have probably got another three years left. I sure hope
so.''
</P>
<P>
   The scramble by employers to find skilled workers may soon
become critical, however, which in turn could spell pressure on
wages and a new inflation risk.
</P>
<P>
   One Chicago-based bank, TCF National, revealed that it is even
sending scouts into city shopping malls. ``If we're being waited on
by somebody who's very good, like at a shoe store, we try to
recruit them,'' said a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   For recruitment firms, like Esquire Staffing Group with offices
in downtown Chicago, it means the pressure to find workers is
relentless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like this in the 40 years I've been
in the business,'' says Esquire Chief Executive Sherwin Fischer.
His consultants simply can't find enough people to fill all the
vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people are nervous wrecks and they don't dare take any
time off because they're making $2000 a day.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago he was predicting at least a slowdown during
1999, but now he is not so sure. ``Frankly, I don't see and end to
it.''

   DAVOS _ Bill Gates, the computer software pioneer, has added his
weight to the chorus of voices warning that Internet stocks have
become seriously overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these companies, some of them now valued by stock
markets at billions of dollars, would not survive the competitive
pressures of the World Wide Web, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stressing that he was a software specialist and not an expert on
stock valuations, Gates said he would not advise any friend to
invest in Internet companies, and those who did were taking on
``monumental risks.''
</P>
<P>
   The billionaire software entrepreneur said that the pace of
change in Internet technology and the degree of commercial
competition that the Net makes possible made projections for the
future revenues of many of these companies highly suspect.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprising observation which seemed to question the very
high valuation the stock market puts on his own company, Microsoft,
Gates told a meeting of journalists at the World Economic Forum in
Davos, Switzerland, that he thought that all technology stocks were
much too highly valued.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should be selling on lower multiples than ordinary
companies because this business is changing so rapidly, and as a
consequence it is impossible to predict an earnings stream into the
future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney and Coca-Cola are in a far more stable position in the
marketplace than we are, and with them you know they will be making
good profits for years to come. With many tech companies this is
not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates predicted that the balance of benefit from the rapid
growth of electronic commerce would be with consumers rather than
the businesses that operate on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many old established distribution companies are now appearing
on the Internet and the competition is going to be intense,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are rushing in like a gold rush. In some respects
this is a good thing since it attracts huge amounts of venture
capital into the business and that accelerates the pace of progress
and change in this industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates said Microsoft wouldn't rule out buying an Internet
company, even at current valuations. ``Sometimes there is a piece
which fits into our strategy which might make it worth paying these
valuations, but that is very different from what the company is
worth on a stand-alone basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates thought it a terrible indictment of European enterprise
and business that the composition of its top 50 companies had
changed so little over the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S., only three or four of the top 50 companies are the
same. In Europe it's the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Gates thought it unlikely that Microsoft would still be in its
present position in the league table of U.S. companies in 25 years
time, given the degree of competitive pressure and change it has to
respond to.
</P>
<P>
   Looking relaxed and at ease with the world, Gates said he wasn't
allowing the antitrust case against Microsoft in the U.S. to
interfere with either his life or his company.
</P>
<P>
   There are more important things in life, he said, admitting that
he now takes his daughter to school every Wednesday morning before
going to work. &QL;

FALCONS' ROBINSON FALLS SHORT OF OWN SUPER STANDARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Eugene Robinson was beaten down long before Rod Smith
beat him on a game-turning, 80-yard touchdown reception Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, the free safety for the Atlanta Falcons, had spent a
sleepless Saturday night after being arrested on a charge of
soliciting an undercover police officer for oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the same Eugene Robinson who became a team and community
leader while playing with the Seahawks and Green Bay Packers before
adopting the same role in his first season with the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the same Eugene Robinson who Saturday morning had accepted
the Bart Starr Award that is given for high moral character, and
was accompanied by his wife and two children at the Athletes in
Action event were it was presented.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe, and I strongly believe, I will be found
innocent in this thing, but not righteous by the standards that I
set,'' a solemn Robinson said after the Falcons' 34-19 loss to the
Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the players, on all the teams, Robinson seems perhaps the
most unlikely for this to happen to.
</P>
<P>
   It was Robinson who had said earlier in the week he would not
allow his teammates to be distracted the night before the game.
</P>
<P>
   It was Robinson who stood outside the Miami Beach Convention
Center, the site of Friday night's lavish commissioners' party, and
offered of the Starr Award, ``A lot of awards are just awards. But
this is one I'd like to win because of what it means, why it is
given and who it is named after.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was Robinson at 9 p.m. Saturday on Biscayne Boulevard,
a major nightclub area frequented by prostitutes and drug dealers.
He was arrested after approaching an undercover police officer and
offering her $40 for oral sex, according to the police report.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was released to a team official and returned to the
team hotel near the Miami airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of time to think about this and quite frankly I
got no sleep,'' Robinson said after the game.
</P>
<P>
   After being released, he was consoled in his hotel room by
several teammates, including linebacker Cornelius Bennett and
cornerback Ray Buchanan, according to Samuel Robinson, the player's
father, who also was in the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't say anything about what happened, and I didn't ask
him,'' Samuel Robinson told The Associated Press. ``But you could
see he was crushed. I've never seen my son with that look of
concern and disappointment in his entire life.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson declined to discuss the specifics of the arrest or the
event that led to it, on advice from his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel, I strongly feel, that I will be found innocent,''
Robinson said. ``But what I want to do now is apologize first to my
Lord Jesus Christ, secondly to my wife and kids, and thirdly to my
teammates and the entire Atlanta Falcons organization for the
distraction that I may have caused them.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates refused to blame Robinson's situation for their
ineffective effort against the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that had anything to do with the emotion and the
attitude of the team at all,'' said rookie Tim Dwight, who returned
a kickoff 94 yards for a touchdown. ``The guys really huddled
around him. He's family, and people make mistakes. I don't think it
had one part to do with this ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   Falcons coach Dan Reeves met at length with Robinson after he
was released Saturday night. He bristled after the game when
pressed about the impact of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate it happened,'' Reeves said. ``I don't think
it was a distraction. My biggest concern was Eugene Robinson. Was
he ready to play and be focused? I thought he did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But Robinson did not play a good game. Not that kind of
game that has become his trademark in being voted to the Pro Bowl
for three different teams and making it to each of the past three
Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   He missed tackles. He was often out of position. And he was flat
out beaten on the 80-yard TD pass from John Elway to Smith that was
the biggest play in the game _ a quick-strike score that pushed the
Broncos' lead from 10-3 to 17-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to Eugene is very unfortunate,'' said Broncos
fullback Howard Griffith, who scored two TDs. ``The thing about it
is that they lost the game. That will magnify the entire
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   As if it could get any bigger. It was all over the TV pregame
shows and the non-stop topic of conversation among the players and
reporters in the hours leading up to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret I was not maintaining the standards I have set for
myself,'' Robinson said. ``I will have to continue, trust me, to
make amends with everyone that knows me.''

 By ROBERT FISK  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT _ From across the Middle East, there has come an
intriguing _ not to say astonishing _ chorus of approval for Crown
Prince Abdullah of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   In the pages of ``Babel'' _ produced by the one editor you would
never contradict, Saddam Hussein's son, Oudai, readers have been
told Abdullah's appointment is ``one of the King's most intelligent
political decisions since the start of the Sixties.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Gulf, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright talked
of King Hussein's ``magnificent job'' in arranging for his
succession.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, a former Israeli defense ministry official, Alon
Pinkas, said Abdullah was an ``excellent student'' in America.
Pinkas should know; he taught Jordan's future king at Georgetown
University.
</P>
<P>
   But when Saddam Hussein, Madeleine Albright and the Israelis all
sing the same tune, something has got to be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   If the Israelis were prepared to send a killer squad to Amman to
assassinate a Palestinian leader after the peace treaty with
Jordan, why should they be any more prepared to respect the
integrity of Abdullah's kingdom?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the first meetings that Israeli prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu held to discuss Abdullah's succession included
Ephraim Halevy, head of the Mossad intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials were quoted as saying they would be behind the
Crown Prince ``in the short term.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Saddam Hussein was prepared to send his killer squads to
knock off the Iraqi opposition in Amman, why should his son
suddenly wish to improve relations with the Hashemite dynasty that
gave political asylum to President Saddam's son-in-laws?
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that the Iraqis have suddenly remembered King
Hussein's former friendship with Saddam? Or are they anxious to
ensure Abdullah does not allow the United States to use Amman as a
base to overthrow Saddam's regime?
</P>
<P>
   Closer study of Mrs. Albright's tribute shows she hoped the
transition to Abdullah was ``one that does not cause problems.''
What sort of problems, one wonders, was she anticipating?
Resistance to his leadership from Palestinian Jordanians? Or
resistance by Crown Prince Abdullah to pressure from Washington?
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to be a ``friend'' of America _ another to be
obedient to the wishes of an American president. What if Abdullah
shows as much independence of spirit as his father did in 1991,
when he refused to support the West's military campaign against
Iraq?
</P>
<P>
   There is, in fact, a disturbing irony in the fact that while
British aircraft fly the skies of Iraq's ``no-fly'' zones, a
half-British prince is preparing to rule Iraq's closest Arab
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   The colonial history of Jordan can only be reemphasized by
Abdullah's succession. It is not just his English accent _ after
all, the British put his grandfather on the throne, propped up his
father with military leaders (until King Hussein grew tired of
them) and can now claim a half-share in the next king's bloodline.
</P>
<P>
   It's as well for the Palestinians of Jordan _ perhaps 65 percent
of the country _ that Abdullah's wife, Rania al-Yassine, is
Palestinian.
</P>
<P>
   Most Arabs, it should be said, have accepted the new crown
prince's appointment, not with enthusiasm but with the kind of
weariness born of knowing that they will never have a say in the
appointment of their leaders (and only occasionally in their
overthrow).
</P>
<P>
   ``America decided it should be Abdullah,'' one of Lebanon's more
cynical politicians said Friday. ``Without Washington's approval,
he would never have been appointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course it is true that American fighter-bombers are based _
albeit with less publicity than in the Gulf _ on at least one major
Jordanian airstrip.
</P>
<P>
   It is also true that before King Hussein's original journey to
the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota last year, the Americans were trying
to persuade him to allow the principle Iraqi opposition groups to
use Amman as their headquarters for the future overthrow of Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there was much talk in Jordan of a move eastwards
by the Jordanian army into the Iraqi desert, where the Jordanians
(sponsored by the Americans) would set up a ``sanctuary'' to which
Saddam's dissident legions would supposedly flock before setting
out on a crusade to destroy their Iraqi tyrant.
</P>
<P>
   Crown Prince Abdullah knows all about dissent _ and how to
suppress it. His special forces units were used to quell riots in
several Jordanian towns last year. Is he then the man the Americans
might now choose to open up a corridor into Iraq?
</P>
<P>
   No wonder ``Babel'' lavished praise on Abdullah's appointment.
This is not the time for Saddam Hussein's son to offend the son of
King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   And no wonder Netanyahu _ while claiming to pray for the
``miracle'' of King Hussein's return to health _ described his
country's peace with Jordan as ``one of the cornerstones of
Israel's national security.''
</P>
<P>
   He knew when King Hussein's anger would break _ Netanyahu was
lucky to get his would-be assassins back from Jordan without a
show-trial in Amman _ but cannot guess when Abdullah's patience
might become exhausted. &QL;

<P>
   BEIRUT _ From across the Middle East, there has come an
intriguing _ not to say astonishing _ chorus of approval for Crown
Prince Abdullah of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   In the pages of ``Babel'' _ produced by the one editor you would
never contradict, Saddam Hussein's son, Oudai, readers have been
told Abdullah's appointment is ``one of the King's most intelligent
political decisions since the start of the Sixties.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Gulf, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright talked
of King Hussein's ``magnificent job'' in arranging for his
succession.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, a former Israeli defense ministry official, Alon
Pinkas, said Abdullah was an ``excellent student'' in America.
Pinkas should know; he taught Jordan's future king at Georgetown
University.
</P>
<P>
   But when Saddam Hussein, Madeleine Albright and the Israelis all
sing the same tune, something has got to be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   If the Israelis were prepared to send a killer squad to Amman to
assassinate a Palestinian leader after the peace treaty with
Jordan, why should they be any more prepared to respect the
integrity of Abdullah's kingdom?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the first meetings that Israeli prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu held to discuss Abdullah's succession included
Ephraim Halevy, head of the Mossad intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials were quoted as saying they would be behind the
Crown Prince ``in the short term.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Saddam Hussein was prepared to send his killer squads to
knock off the Iraqi opposition in Amman, why should his son
suddenly wish to improve relations with the Hashemite dynasty that
gave political asylum to President Saddam's son-in-laws?
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that the Iraqis have suddenly remembered King
Hussein's former friendship with Saddam? Or are they anxious to
ensure Abdullah does not allow the United States to use Amman as a
base to overthrow Saddam's regime?
</P>
<P>
   Closer study of Mrs. Albright's tribute shows she hoped the
transition to Abdullah was ``one that does not cause problems.''
What sort of problems, one wonders, was she anticipating?
Resistance to his leadership from Palestinian Jordanians? Or
resistance by Crown Prince Abdullah to pressure from Washington?
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to be a ``friend'' of America _ another to be
obedient to the wishes of an American president. What if Abdullah
shows as much independence of spirit as his father did in 1991,
when he refused to support the West's military campaign against
Iraq?
</P>
<P>
   There is, in fact, a disturbing irony in the fact that while
British aircraft fly the skies of Iraq's ``no-fly'' zones, a
half-British prince is preparing to rule Iraq's closest Arab
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   The colonial history of Jordan can only be reemphasized by
Abdullah's succession. It is not just his English accent _ after
all, the British put his grandfather on the throne, propped up his
father with military leaders (until King Hussein grew tired of
them) and can now claim a half-share in the next king's bloodline.
</P>
<P>
   It's as well for the Palestinians of Jordan _ perhaps 65 percent
of the country _ that Abdullah's wife, Rania al-Yassine, is
Palestinian.
</P>
<P>
   Most Arabs, it should be said, have accepted the new crown
prince's appointment, not with enthusiasm but with the kind of
weariness born of knowing that they will never have a say in the
appointment of their leaders (and only occasionally in their
overthrow).
</P>
<P>
   ``America decided it should be Abdullah,'' one of Lebanon's more
cynical politicians said Friday. ``Without Washington's approval,
he would never have been appointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course it is true that American fighter-bombers are based _
albeit with less publicity than in the Gulf _ on at least one major
Jordanian airstrip.
</P>
<P>
   It is also true that before King Hussein's original journey to
the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota last year, the Americans were trying
to persuade him to allow the principle Iraqi opposition groups to
use Amman as their headquarters for the future overthrow of Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there was much talk in Jordan of a move eastwards
by the Jordanian army into the Iraqi desert, where the Jordanians
(sponsored by the Americans) would set up a ``sanctuary'' to which
Saddam's dissident legions would supposedly flock before setting
out on a crusade to destroy their Iraqi tyrant.
</P>
<P>
   Crown Prince Abdullah knows all about dissent _ and how to
suppress it. His special forces units were used to quell riots in
several Jordanian towns last year. Is he then the man the Americans
might now choose to open up a corridor into Iraq?
</P>
<P>
   No wonder ``Babel'' lavished praise on Abdullah's appointment.
This is not the time for Saddam Hussein's son to offend the son of
King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   And no wonder Netanyahu _ while claiming to pray for the
``miracle'' of King Hussein's return to health _ described his
country's peace with Jordan as ``one of the cornerstones of
Israel's national security.''
</P>
<P>
   He knew when King Hussein's anger would break _ Netanyahu was
lucky to get his would-be assassins back from Jordan without a
show-trial in Amman _ but cannot guess when Abdullah's patience
might become exhausted. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Drive into any large American city and you will see
them _ billboards entreating you to watch such and such a
television station for the excellence of its evening news.
</P>
<P>
   Beaming down at you with impossible smiles will be the faces of
that station's newsreaders. Almost always, it will be a man,
chisel-chinned and serious eyebrows, accompanied by a woman, all
glamor and cheekbone.
</P>
<P>
   The faux-family formula has proved irresistible to roughly nine
out of ten local stations across the land. Pair a man (preferably
young and attractive) with a woman (obligatorily young and
attractive), get some chemistry going between them and the viewers
will reward you.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind if the practice violates the normal standards of
equal opportunity and fairness in hiring and firing. Only the
ratings count.
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned, however, because the picture may soon begin to
change.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is in shock over a former star of the Connecticut
news market, Janet Peckinpaugh, 48, who has sued her old employers
at the CBS affiliate in the state capital, Hartford, saying they
dumped her from the station's prime-time evening newscast in 1994
because she was a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Peckinpaugh won her case in dramatic fashion. Ruling
that she had indeed been the victim of gender discrimination, the
Hartford jury awarded her damages totaling an astonishing $8.3
million _ more than double what she had been seeking.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant was the Washington Post Company, which used to own
the station through a subsidiary. (The station has since been
sold.)
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, Peckinpaugh was, as it were, the perfect package
for WFSB-TV. With blond hair, green eyes and a high-energy manner,
she was groomed into stardom as the co-anchor of the station's
all-important 6 p.m. Action News.
</P>
<P>
   She earned $250,000 a year and enjoyed other celebrity perks.
But eventually, as she passed the dreaded fortieth birthday, she
began to encounter friction.
</P>
<P>
   Her demise finally came in 1994 when WFSB hired a new male
anchor from a competing station and decreed that all three of its
existing female newsreaders audition before the cameras with its
two male anchors, including the newcomer.
</P>
<P>
   Peckinpaugh scored the lowest of the three women and was demoted
from the evening show. She eventually left to another station and
to a salary of just $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   There were other factors in the case. Most notably, Peckinpaugh
had some years before accused the incoming male anchor, Al Terzi,
with whom she had previously worked, of fondling her in a hotel
room. Her demotion, she said, was partly to do with the fallout
from that episode and male retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   She also testified that her managers had assured her of a
long-running prime-time career at the station, regardless of her
advancing age, and that her demotion had therefore been a breach of
faith.
</P>
<P>
   For the jury, however, it was WFSB-TV's apparent fixation with
matching just two women with its two men that led to Peckinpaugh's
demise and warranted the award of such colossal damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most everyone understands that it's the industry practice,''
one jury member said after the verdict. ``But you can't
discriminate on the basis of sex and they were blatant about it.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The guy-girl format rules on the national breakfast-time shows
as well, the most celebrated pairing being that of Katie Couric (no
longer really young, but perky) and Matt Lauer (puppy-dog looks but
can look serious) on NBC's ratings runaway, the Today Show.
</P>
<P>
   Where it does not apply is on the nightly network news programs,
broadcast nationally, of ABC, NBC and CBS. Presiding over them
alone for more than a decade have been _ all men here _ Peter
Jennings, Tom Brokaw and Dan Rather.
</P>
<P>
   CBS tried pairing Rather with Connie Chung a few years ago but
then dumped Chung when ratings dived. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After Thursday's verdict, Peckinpaugh said her battle had been
for all women in an industry where nature treats the sexes
differently. In TV-land, in other words, women get old while men
get distinguished.
</P>
<P>
   True, there are some female newscast stars with the national
networks, who are, shall we say, no longer in their springtime
years _ notably Barbara Walters, Diane Sawyer, and Leslie Stahl.
But as the New York Times noted last week, none among them dare
show one grey hair before the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Although the issues of age and gender were closely linked in the
case, the jury dismissed the age discrimination element of
Peckinpaugh's suit. This, however, did little to dull the verdict's
impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major victory for every woman in television, and
every woman who wants to go into television,'' Peckinpaugh said.
``It's about time that my industry caught up with the rest of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Those billboards are not coming down just yet, however. David
Klatell of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism,
warns that it may take more to persuade the industry to change its
habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could be more sanguine that this would change the
hiring pattern in American TV news. I fear that it may instead
result more in changes in the firing pattern, with lawyers
instructing news directors to be more careful in the way they let
people go,'' he said.

for WFSB-TV. With blond hair, green eyes and a high-energy manner,
she was groomed into stardom as the co-anchor of the station's
all-important 6 p.m. Action News.
</P>
<P>
   She earned $250,000 a year and enjoyed other celebrity perks.
But eventually, as she passed the dreaded fortieth birthday, she
began to encounter friction.
</P>
<P>
   Her demise finally came in 1994 when WFSB hired a new male
anchor from a competing station and decreed that all three of its
existing female newsreaders audition before the cameras with its
two male anchors, including the newcomer.
</P>
<P>
   Peckinpaugh scored the lowest of the three women and was demoted
from the evening show. She eventually left to another station and
to a salary of just $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   There were other factors in the case. Most notably, Peckinpaugh
had some years before accused the incoming male anchor, Al Terzi,
with whom she had previously worked, of fondling her in a hotel
room. Her demotion, she said, was partly to do with the fallout
from that episode and male retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   She also testified that her managers had assured her of a
long-running prime-time career at the station, regardless of her
advancing age, and that her demotion had therefore been a breach of
faith.
</P>
<P>
   For the jury, however, it was WFSB-TV's apparent fixation with
matching just two women with its two men that led to Peckinpaugh's
demise and warranted the award of such colossal damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most everyone understands that it's the industry practice,''
one jury member said after the verdict. ``But you can't
discriminate on the basis of sex and they were blatant about it.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The guy-girl format rules on the national breakfast-time shows
as well, the most celebrated pairing being that of Katie Couric (no
longer really young, but perky) and Matt Lauer (puppy-dog looks but
can look serious) on NBC's ratings runaway, the Today Show.
</P>
<P>
   Where it does not apply is on the nightly network news programs,
broadcast nationally, of ABC, NBC and CBS. Presiding over them
alone for more than a decade have been _ all men here _ Peter
Jennings, Tom Brokaw and Dan Rather.
</P>
<P>
   CBS tried pairing Rather with Connie Chung a few years ago but
then dumped Chung when ratings dived. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After Thursday's verdict, Peckinpaugh said her battle had been
for all women in an industry where nature treats the sexes
differently. In TV-land, in other words, women get old while men
get distinguished.
</P>
<P>
   True, there are some female newscast stars with the national
networks, who are, shall we say, no longer in their springtime
years _ notably Barbara Walters, Diane Sawyer, and Leslie Stahl.
But as the New York Times noted last week, none among them dare
show one grey hair before the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Although the issues of age and gender were closely linked in the
case, the jury dismissed the age discrimination element of
Peckinpaugh's suit. This, however, did little to dull the verdict's
impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major victory for every woman in television, and
every woman who wants to go into television,'' Peckinpaugh said.
``It's about time that my industry caught up with the rest of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Those billboards are not coming down just yet, however. David
Klatell of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism,
warns that it may take more to persuade the industry to change its
habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could be more sanguine that this would change the
hiring pattern in American TV news. I fear that it may instead
result more in changes in the firing pattern, with lawyers
instructing news directors to be more careful in the way they let
people go,'' he said.

   LOS ANGELES _ Pity the National Enquirer. For the last year,
America has been treated to the greatest tabloid story ever told _
a presidential affair with more salacious details than any
supermarket weekly could ever dream of, a political scandal with
seemingly endless reverberations, and a cast of characters, from
Linda Tripp to Henry Hyde to Larry Flynt, that could keep a daytime
soap writer in ideas for years.
</P>
<P>
   And yet America's tabloid newspapers and downmarket television
reality shows have done singularly badly out of the Monica Lewinsky
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The Enquirer's readership is down almost 20 percent, as is the
Globe's. The Star, the newspaper that broke the alleged story of
Bill Clinton's black love child, has performed slightly better, but
its sales figures are deep in depression too.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same story with ``Hard Copy'' and ``Inside Edition,''
the television shows that attempt to emulate on the small screen
what the tabloids do on paper. According to figures released by
Nielsen Media Research, they have lost at last 20 percent of their
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Is this a reflection of popular disgust with the
impeachment drama, a realization that sleazoid values in American
society have gone too far?
</P>
<P>
   Not at all. If Americans haven't been reading about Monica
Lewinsky in the tabloids, it's because they can find all the facts
and more on the front-page of the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   And if they miss it there they can watch the network evening
news. Or one of the 24-hour news channels. Or read it on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There has been such saturation coverage of Monica that the
tabloids simply haven't had a look-in. What can even a rich
publication with near-limitless resources do to trump Kenneth
Starr? A tabloid may be sneaky but none has yet invented a way of
dishing out subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   Far from signaling a new vogue for high-mindedness, the
declining sales and viewing figures actually bear witness to the
growing tabloidization of America _ a process that has reached its
apotheosis with Monica Lewinsky but began long before her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tabloidification of American life'' _ of the news, of the
culture, yea, of human behavior _ is such a sweeping phenomenon
that it can't be dismissed as merely a jokey footnote to the
history of the 1990s. Rather, it's the very hallmark of our
times,'' David Kamp wrote in a long analysis in this month's
``Vanity Fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the decade, stories like the William
Kennedy Smith rape trial (in which the New York Times took the
unprecedented step of naming the alleged victim), the dismembering
of John Wayne Bobbitt and _ above all _ the O.J. Simpson trial have
pushed tabloid values into the mainstream and left little but
extraneous gossip for the real tabloids to chew over.
</P>
<P>
   Of the six tabloid shows on network television at the beginning
of the decade, three have disappeared altogether _ and it's largely
because the more respectable shows have encroached on their turf.
</P>
<P>
   One former reporter for ``Hard Copy,'' Diane Dimond, recounted
how in 1996 she pursued the story of a Massachusetts woman who was
raising triplets on her own only to discover that exclusive
interview rights had already been snapped up by ABC's star
reporter, Diane Sawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the big media organizations have done their best to
dress up their stories and investigations in a mantle of
respectability.
</P>
<P>
   Most have pointedly refused to run with the (usually accurate)
salacious material dug up by Internet columnist Matt Drudge; they
have, however, done everything to raise the same issues in
interviews and news conferences so they can hide behind the
authority of a congressman, say, to print the same story with a
semblance of honor.
</P>
<P>
   The same has been true of ``Hustler'' publisher Larry Flynt's
revelations on Republican congressmen. The papers happily reported
Bob Livingston's adultery after the would-be Speaker of the House
admitted it himself at Flynt's prompting.
</P>
<P>
   When the same trick failed to make the Georgian House member Bob
Barr flinch, the allegations were pushed into opinion columns
discussing the mores of character assassination rather than taking
their place on the news pages, where they might be seen to give
credence to a notorious pornographer.
</P>
<P>
   That small degree of tact has not left much of a window for the
tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmaker John Waters once characterized the editorial
policy of the three supermarket tabloids as ``We hate you because
you're famous,'' ``We hate you because you're on TV,'' and ``We
hate you because you're famous and have sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Monica should have fit into all three tabloid
categories _ but the big guns from the Times and the Washington
Post got there first. &QL;

<P>
   It is hard to imagine Jordan without King Hussein _ or so runs
the old saw. He has dominated the country for 46 years, first as
authoritarian ruler, more recently as a hands-on constitutional
monarch.
</P>
<P>
   Nine out of ten of his subjects were born during his reign. He
is the one symbol that all Jordanians, rich and poor, secular and
religious, Palestinian refugees and indigenous citizens, have in
common.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Jordan will lose its king, and probably sooner rather than
later. King Hussein himself implied as much by coming home for a
few days to attend to the succession, before unexpectedly rushing
back to America this week for more medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Only 63, he could now be facing a fourth bout of cancer, and the
choice of an heir is clearly on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   His brother, Hassan, had served loyally as crown prince since
1964, when the king's oldest son, Abdullah, was still a baby. But
King Hussein had long made it clear that he would like the crown
eventually to pass to one of his children.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 25, in unnecessarily humiliating fashion, the king
demoted Hassan and elevated Abdullah as heir by royal decree.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the problem: as with every detail of his reign,
King Hussein managed the change personally. Although Jordan is
theoretically a constitutional monarchy, neither the Jordanian
people, nor their representatives in parliament, had any say over
the selection of their future king.
</P>
<P>
   The constitution does state that the king's eldest son will
succeed him. But King Hussein had had it altered in favor of Hassan
before, and many thought he might fix it again to install one of
his younger sons.
</P>
<P>
   At no point, apparently, did King Hussein consult anyone. As
always, he knew best.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, King Hussein often does know best. His stewardship
has seen Jordan develop from an artificial, divided and fragile
polity into a reasonably stable, united and well-governed country.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the despots of neighboring Arab countries, King
Hussein is a model of benign and competent rule.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah, too, shows every sign of benevolence and ability,
albeit in his rather sheltered career in the army. But Jordan's
luck cannot last forever. Good rulers, history shows, do not grow
on family trees.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of agonizing over which of Jordan's many princes should
succeed him, King Hussein should be making sure that the country's
institutions are strong enough to make the choice irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the king has concentrated power in his own hands.
Although he introduced some democracy in 1989 after decades of
martial law, he has taken care to rein in debate and preserve his
ultimate authority.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a weighted electoral law, parliament is dominated by
tribal elders fiercely loyal to the king. The main opposition party
boycotted the last elections in protest, and so has been excluded
from political debate.
</P>
<P>
   The press, too, has been brought to heel by a law that forbids,
in effect, any criticism of the king or his strategy of alliance
with America and peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Before the king's illness, Jordan's unions and professional
associations, which are among the few remaining bastions of
independent political power, had also been under attack.
</P>
<P>
   And one reason for the humbling of poor Prince Hassan was that,
while acting as regent, he had tried to make some military
appointments without consulting the controller-in-chief on his
sickbed.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps King Hussein believes that by bequeathing a blend of
strong royal rule and limited democracy he will increase his
dynasty's chances of survival. But he himself has had trouble
imposing this system in the face of public protest, and the chances
that any successor would handle dissent as adroitly are slim.
</P>
<P>
   The best hope for Jordan's monarchy, and the best future for its
people, lies in the king gradually handing over most of his powers
to parliament.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein should spend whatever remains of his reign making
himself dispensable. Otherwise, the old axiom notwithstanding, it
is not so hard to imagine what will become of his heirs. &QL;

   First-class travel, the finest hotels, sycophancy on a level
normally known only to royalty: since all this is routine for the
114 members of the International Olympic Committee _ and their
husbands and wives _ why should they not expect a little extra when
pressed to decide which of the world's cities should hold an
Olympic Games?
</P>
<P>
   A college scholarship for a much-loved son, perhaps? A concert
engagement for a piano-playing daughter? Some expert, and
expensive, medical treatment? Even, for the less attractive, a
pretty female escort?
</P>
<P>
   Those politicians and businessmen who now express outrage at the
methods that have allegedly won Salt Lake City the right to hold
the Winter Olympics in 2002 are either naive or disingenuous.
</P>
<P>
   Bribery and the Olympics, the cynics point out, have long gone
together. But bribery and what the IOC calls ``the Olympic spirit''
have not.
</P>
<P>
   That is surely one reason why hard evidence of corruption has
been so long in coming: ever since Los Angeles, in 1984, proved
that the games could be a financial blessing rather than a burden,
the IOC leadership, the television companies, the advertising
sponsors and the bidding cities themselves have found it easier to
hold their noses than to get rid of the smell.
</P>
<P>
   After all, why make enemies of delegates who can cast votes
until the age of 80?
</P>
<P>
   How sensible it was of the organizers of last year's Winter
Games in the Japanese town of Nagano to destroy the relevant
records. How foolish of those strait-laced Mormons of Salt Lake
City to spill the beans.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious risk for the IOC is that the evidence will grow, the
public will be appalled, the sponsors will take fright and the
television companies will lose heart _ in other words, the modern
Olympics will slowly die.

   First-class travel, the finest hotels, sycophancy on a level
normally known only to royalty: since all this is routine for the
114 members of the International Olympic Committee _ and their

pressed to decide which of the world's cities should hold an
Olympic Games?
</P>

<P>
   Is it time to lift sanctions on Iraq? On the face of it, the
answer must be no.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years have passed since the Gulf war, yet Saddam Hussein
is still in power in Iraq, still oppressing his people, still
shooting at the American and British warplanes that try to contain
him, still hiding some of the arms, or the wherewithal for making
them, that the U.N. Security Council said he should give up before
the trade embargo would be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Simply to abandon sanctions now would be to hand victory to
Hussein and to give him a free hand to rebuild his arsenal of
chemical, nuclear and biological weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a change in policy is required, and at least some sanctions
should indeed be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   A change is needed for two reasons. One is that over the past
year the impediments placed by Iraq before the U.N. inspectors
monitoring the weapons made their job virtually impossible, and now
they have been thrown out. The most useful check on Hussein is thus
ended.
</P>
<P>
   The other reason is that the old policy has come to be seen as
inflicting appalling suffering on 20 million or more innocent
Iraqis and not much on their guilty, and unelected, masters.
</P>
<P>
   True, Iraq is allowed to sell some oil and spend the proceeds,
under U.N. supervision, on food, medicine and other humanitarian
supplies, once deductions have been made to compensate Iraq's
victims and pay the U.N.'s expenses.
</P>
<P>
   But the procedures are cumbersome, Iraq's dilapidated equipment
is unable to pump even as much oil as it is allowed to sell, and
Hussein is too often able to present his people's plight as the
fault of sanctions, rather than of himself.
</P>
<P>
   Four days of air strikes last month served to strengthen the
feeling, by no means confined to the Arab world, that the Iraqi
people have suffered enough.
</P>
<P>
   It is an iron law that the longer any sanctions regime is in
place, the harder it is to enforce it. Already the trade embargo is
widely breached _ even, where Turkey is involved, with a nod and
wink from the United States, supposedly its fiercest upholder.
</P>
<P>
   But the breaches bring no benefits to most Iraqis. Their misery,
coupled with the other manifest failures of the present policy,
make it likely that the existing sanctions will be increasingly
disregarded if the policy is not changed.
</P>
<P>
   True, the U.N.'s arms monitors want no lifting of sanctions,
and, perhaps less predictably, the Arab League, meeting on Jan. 24,
likewise gave Hussein no encouragement. But Arabs feel much more
sympathy for Iraqis than for their leader, and even Saudi Arabia
has recently floated ideas about a change in sanctions policy.
</P>
<P>
   France, too, has made some new suggestions. Russia and China
have long been critical, and the skeptics' corner of the Security
Council has just been strengthened by the arrival of Malaysia and
Namibia as temporary members.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the pressure for change, the new prime minister of
Turkey, which has in the past allowed its territory to be used for
strikes against Iraq, has warned America not necessarily to count
on its continued support.
</P>
<P>
   In so far as a new consensus is emerging, it is a sensible one:
that the pressure should be relaxed on Iraqis at large but
maintained, or if possible intensified, on the regime.
</P>
<P>
   The question is how. The French proposals seem to offer a
possible way. If, regrettably, the U.N.'s weapons inspectors cannot
resume their work, forget about them and the blanket trade embargo;
instead set up a new outfit to monitor all sites that have already
been inspected and enforce an embargo only on weapons, on imports
that could be used to make weapons, and on related financial
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   This is not free from objections. One is that Hussein might veto
it. Yet the fact that the plan would have the support of many, if
not most, of his traditional friends would make his opposition less
likely.
</P>
<P>
   More probable is that he would grudgingly accept it, but then
try to frustrate it. In that event, the customary response _ air
strikes against military objectives _ would always be available;
they might even win wider support than in the past, given that he
would be even more unambiguously seen as the reason for them.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the main objection is the difficulty and expense of
operating a system that would involve monitors at the borders of
Iraq, who would have to check everything going in and out. Some
forbidden imports would inevitably get through.
</P>
<P>
   If the oil price stays low, such a plan might put little more
money in Iraq's coffers, and make only a small difference to
ordinary Iraqis. But it would deny their true oppressor a
propaganda weapon, and it would preserve the essential ingredient
of current policy, which is the containment of Saddam. &QL;

widely breached _ even, where Turkey is involved, with a nod and
wink from the United States, supposedly its fiercest upholder.
</P>
<P>
   But the breaches bring no benefits to most Iraqis. Their misery,
coupled with the other manifest failures of the present policy,
make it likely that the existing sanctions will be increasingly
disregarded if the policy is not changed.
</P>
<P>
   True, the U.N.'s arms monitors want no lifting of sanctions,
and, perhaps less predictably, the Arab League, meeting on Jan. 24,
likewise gave Hussein no encouragement. But Arabs feel much more
sympathy for Iraqis than for their leader, and even Saudi Arabia
has recently floated ideas about a change in sanctions policy.
</P>
<P>
   France, too, has made some new suggestions. Russia and China
have long been critical, and the skeptics' corner of the Security
Council has just been strengthened by the arrival of Malaysia and
Namibia as temporary members.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the pressure for change, the new prime minister of
Turkey, which has in the past allowed its territory to be used for
strikes against Iraq, has warned America not necessarily to count
on its continued support.
</P>
<P>
   In so far as a new consensus is emerging, it is a sensible one:
that the pressure should be relaxed on Iraqis at large but
maintained, or if possible intensified, on the regime.
</P>
<P>
   The question is how. The French proposals seem to offer a
possible way. If, regrettably, the U.N.'s weapons inspectors cannot
resume their work, forget about them and the blanket trade embargo;
instead set up a new outfit to monitor all sites that have already
been inspected and enforce an embargo only on weapons, on imports
that could be used to make weapons, and on related financial
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   This is not free from objections. One is that Hussein might veto
it. Yet the fact that the plan would have the support of many, if
not most, of his traditional friends would make his opposition less
likely.
</P>
<P>
   More probable is that he would grudgingly accept it, but then
try to frustrate it. In that event, the customary response _ air
strikes against military objectives _ would always be available;
they might even win wider support than in the past, given that he
would be even more unambiguously seen as the reason for them.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the main objection is the difficulty and expense of
operating a system that would involve monitors at the borders of
Iraq, who would have to check everything going in and out. Some
forbidden imports would inevitably get through.
</P>
<P>
   If the oil price stays low, such a plan might put little more
money in Iraq's coffers, and make only a small difference to
ordinary Iraqis. But it would deny their true oppressor a
propaganda weapon, and it would preserve the essential ingredient
of current policy, which is the containment of Saddam. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it time to lift sanctions on Iraq? On the face of it, the
answer must be no.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years have passed since the Gulf war, yet Saddam Hussein
is still in power in Iraq, still oppressing his people, still
shooting at the American and British warplanes that try to contain
him, still hiding some of the arms, or the wherewithal for making
them, that the U.N. Security Council said he should give up before
the trade embargo would be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Simply to abandon sanctions now would be to hand victory to
Hussein and to give him a free hand to rebuild his arsenal of
chemical, nuclear and biological weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a change in policy is required, and at least some sanctions
should indeed be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   A change is needed for two reasons. One is that over the past
year the impediments placed by Iraq before the U.N. inspectors
monitoring the weapons made their job virtually impossible, and now
they have been thrown out. The most useful check on Hussein is thus
ended.
</P>
<P>
   The other reason is that the old policy has come to be seen as
inflicting appalling suffering on 20 million or more innocent
Iraqis and not much on their guilty, and unelected, masters.
</P>
<P>
   True, Iraq is allowed to sell some oil and spend the proceeds,
under U.N. supervision, on food, medicine and other humanitarian
supplies, once deductions have been made to compensate Iraq's
victims and pay the U.N.'s expenses.
</P>
<P>
   But the procedures are cumbersome, Iraq's dilapidated equipment
is unable to pump even as much oil as it is allowed to sell, and
Hussein is too often able to present his people's plight as the
fault of sanctions, rather than of himself.
</P>
<P>
   Four days of air strikes last month served to strengthen the
feeling, by no means confined to the Arab world, that the Iraqi
people have suffered enough.
</P>
<P>
   It is an iron law that the longer any sanctions regime is in
place, the harder it is to enforce it. Already the trade embargo is
widely breached _ even, where Turkey is involved, with a nod and
wink from the United States, supposedly its fiercest upholder.
</P>
<P>
   But the breaches bring no benefits to most Iraqis. Their misery,
coupled with the other manifest failures of the present policy,

<P>
   ``The electric light is very probably a great invention,
and...let us take it for granted that its future development will
be vast. But this, unhappily, cannot be urged as a reason why the
pioneer companies should be prosperous.''
</P>
<P>
   Time and technology have moved on since 1882, when these words
appeared in The Economist (as recently spotted by the Wall Street
Journal, assiduously reading our back copies). But the same
sentiments apply to today's great invention, the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is a potent and entirely new medium, the net will
change the way the world works and plays. Even so, today's
pioneering Internet companies are unlikely ever to earn the vast
profits needed to justify their current share prices.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, future historians may well add Internet shares to a long
list of industrial assets _ including biotechnology firms in the
1990s, radio companies in the 1920s, electric-light companies and
railways in the 19th century _ that have come spectacularly
crashing to earth.
</P>
<P>
   This newspaper has long argued that shares in general are
overvalued, especially in America. And, because American consumers
have used their newfound paper wealth to justify spending more and
saving less, the economy looks vulnerable to a collapse in share
prices.
</P>
<P>
   But the inflation of Internet shares is, in many respects, quite
different. Whereas investors on Wall Street are merely exuberant,
the casino capitalists who spend seven or eight hours a day at
their PCs trading Internet shares appear to be stark-raving mad.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who have watched enviously from the sidelines
sense that gravity will assert itself sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the online gamblers who have earned a fortune in paper
profits betting their savings on shares in Yahoo!, Amazon and the
rest will never get their money out. For the very features that
have led to a near-vertical climb of Internet share prices also
favor its precipitous collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Most Internet companies go public by selling only a handful of
shares: only 34 percent of Amazon's equity is publicly traded, and
a mere 9 percent of that of eBay, an online auctioneer.
</P>
<P>
   The few available shares are greedily snapped up by a cyber-army
of online ``day traders'' via electronic brokerages, such as
E*Trade.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's entire float changes hands twice a week. Hedge funds
that sold what they thought were already overvalued shares they did
not actually own have scrambled to buy back as prices rose.
</P>
<P>
   Just as tulips only became truly manic when ordinary people
started trading bulbs in Dutch taverns, so the trebling of Internet
values since September has been accompanied by a surge of trading
among people unskilled in the art of valuation and unburned by past
losses.
</P>
<P>
   All this is likely to reverse with brutal rapidity. A thin
market exaggerates falls as well as rises. The new online
brokerages may not be able to handle large volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, hedge funds will start selling. As losses mount, and
buyers disappear, inexperienced investors could well panic.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody can predict the extent of the fall. Even the experts do
not know how to value Internet shares.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Sharpe, for example, who won the Nobel prize in economics
for work on pricing financial assets, is enough of an Internet
believer to have founded an online financial-advice company. Even
he admits that ``we are all pretty much flying blind.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not merely that few Internet companies actually
make a profit (though this makes traditional measures of value
somewhat redundant). Although few now doubt that electronic
commerce has a thrilling future, reasonable people differ over
what, and how profitable, that future will be.
</P>
<P>
   Some venture capitalists and executives reckon that the biggest
profits will be earned by companies that establish a strong brand
by virtue of being first in a market. They believe the coming
collapse will affect only second- and third-tier firms.
</P>
<P>
   Even this may be optimistic. In the end, valuation comes down to
one simple fact. To justify today's share prices, Internet
companies will have to enjoy unprecedented growth in sales and
margins.
</P>
<P>
   It would take average annual profits of over $1 billion to make
sense of Amazon's current $20 billion-odd market value. Yet
Amazon's total sales in 1998 were only $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   The sales of many of today's Internet stars will never soar that
high. If anything, the Internet will give consumers more power and
make it hard even for firms with a large market share to raise
their margins for long.
</P>
<P>
   And after the fall? Much will depend on whether the bigger stock
market bubble bursts too. If it does, concerns about Internet
shares will be lost amid worries about the world economy as a
whole. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 800. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   If Internet share-values topple in isolation, however, the
effects might actually be salutary.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists in Silicon Valley have more money than they
know what to do with. Even after n Internet crash, there would be
enough wealth to back good ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Because current valuations have inflated what Internet
entrepreneurs think they and their ideas are worth, it would become
cheaper for venture capitalists to invest in them.
</P>
<P>
   The temptation today is to sell up and move on without having
taken the trouble to build a real business. Lower share prices
would force entrepreneurs to lower their expectations and restore
sanity to the net's job market, in which people spend much of their
day looking for employers offering juicier share options.
</P>
<P>
   Investment in Internet businesses would suffer only if venture
capitalists lost faith in electronic commerce itself _ as opposed
to particular firms or the judgment of online traders.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of an Internet share-bust holds a warning for other
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Today's appetite for equities rests on an erroneous belief that
they are a one-way bet: that, in the long run, they always pay
higher returns than other assets. Disappointing profits are
dismissed with a wave of the hand and the promise of a better
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   When Wall Street crashes it is unlikely to fall so far or so
spectacularly as will Internet shares. All the same, when Internet
shares plunge, the screams should strike fear into investors
everywhere. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The electric light is very probably a great invention,
and...let us take it for granted that its future development will
be vast. But this, unhappily, cannot be urged as a reason why the
pioneer companies should be prosperous.''
</P>
<P>
   Time and technology have moved on since 1882, when these words
appeared in The Economist (as recently spotted by the Wall Street
Journal, assiduously reading our back copies). But the same
sentiments apply to today's great invention, the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is a potent and entirely new medium, the net will
change the way the world works and plays. Even so, today's
pioneering Internet companies are unlikely ever to earn the vast
profits needed to justify their current share prices.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, future historians may well add Internet shares to a long
list of industrial assets _ including biotechnology firms in the
1990s, radio companies in the 1920s, electric-light companies and
railways in the 19th century _ that have come spectacularly
crashing to earth.
</P>
<P>
   This newspaper has long argued that shares in general are
overvalued, especially in America. And, because American consumers
have used their newfound paper wealth to justify spending more and
saving less, the economy looks vulnerable to a collapse in share
prices.
</P>
<P>
   But the inflation of Internet shares is, in many respects, quite
different. Whereas investors on Wall Street are merely exuberant,
the casino capitalists who spend seven or eight hours a day at
their PCs trading Internet shares appear to be stark-raving mad.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who have watched enviously from the sidelines
sense that gravity will assert itself sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the online gamblers who have earned a fortune in paper
profits betting their savings on shares in Yahoo!, Amazon and the
rest will never get their money out. For the very features that
have led to a near-vertical climb of Internet share prices also
favor its precipitous collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Most Internet companies go public by selling only a handful of
shares: only 34 percent of Amazon's equity is publicly traded, and
a mere 9 percent of that of eBay, an online auctioneer.
</P>
<P>
   The few available shares are greedily snapped up by a cyber-army
of online ``day traders'' via electronic brokerages, such as
E*Trade.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's entire float changes hands twice a week. Hedge funds
that sold what they thought were already overvalued shares they did
not actually own have scrambled to buy back as prices rose.
</P>
<P>
   Just as tulips only became truly manic when ordinary people
started trading bulbs in Dutch taverns, so the trebling of Internet
values since September has been accompanied by a surge of trading
among people unskilled in the art of valuation and unburned by past
losses.
</P>
<P>
   All this is likely to reverse with brutal rapidity. A thin
market exaggerates falls as well as rises. The new online
brokerages may not be able to handle large volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, hedge funds will start selling. As losses mount, and
buyers disappear, inexperienced investors could well panic.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody can predict the extent of the fall. Even the experts do
not know how to value Internet shares.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Sharpe, for example, who won the Nobel prize in economics
for work on pricing financial assets, is enough of an Internet
believer to have founded an online financial-advice company. Even
he admits that ``we are all pretty much flying blind.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not merely that few Internet companies actually
make a profit (though this makes traditional measures of value
somewhat redundant). Although few now doubt that electronic
commerce has a thrilling future, reasonable people differ over
what, and how profitable, that future will be.
</P>
<P>
   Some venture capitalists and executives reckon that the biggest
profits will be earned by companies that establish a strong brand
by virtue of being first in a market. They believe the coming
collapse will affect only second- and third-tier firms.
</P>
<P>
   Even this may be optimistic. In the end, valuation comes down to
one simple fact. To justify today's share prices, Internet
companies will have to enjoy unprecedented growth in sales and
margins.
</P>
<P>
   It would take average annual profits of over $1 billion to make
sense of Amazon's current $20 billion-odd market value. Yet
Amazon's total sales in 1998 were only $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   The sales of many of today's Internet stars will never soar that
high. If anything, the Internet will give consumers more power and
make it hard even for firms with a large market share to raise
their margins for long.
</P>
<P>
   And after the fall? Much will depend on whether the bigger stock
market bubble bursts too. If it does, concerns about Internet
shares will be lost amid worries about the world economy as a
whole. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 800. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   If Internet share-values topple in isolation, however, the
effects might actually be salutary.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists in Silicon Valley have more money than they
know what to do with. Even after an Internet crash, there would be
enough wealth to back good ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Because current valuations have inflated what Internet
entrepreneurs think they and their ideas are worth, it would become
cheaper for venture capitalists to invest in them.
</P>
<P>
   The temptation today is to sell up and move on without having
taken the trouble to build a real business. Lower share prices
would force entrepreneurs to lower their expectations and restore
sanity to the net's job market, in which people spend much of their
day looking for employers offering juicier share options.
</P>
<P>
   Investment in Internet businesses would suffer only if venture
capitalists lost faith in electronic commerce itself _ as opposed
to particular firms or the judgment of online traders.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of an Internet share-bust holds a warning for other
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Today's appetite for equities rests on an erroneous belief that
they are a one-way bet: that, in the long run, they always pay
higher returns than other assets. Disappointing profits are
dismissed with a wave of the hand and the promise of a better
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   When Wall Street crashes it is unlikely to fall so far or so
spectacularly as will Internet shares. All the same, when Internet
shares plunge, the screams should strike fear into investors
everywhere. &QL;

<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ As the aircraft Shepherd One opened its doors, and
the shockingly frail and weak 78-year-old Pope John Paul II slowly
emerged, he scarcely looked like someone who could command the
attention of a president.
</P>
<P>
   That president, having stolen away from trial-locked Washington
to sneak an hour with the pope, waited with the First Lady in a
hangar. At the airport and in the streets of St. Louis more than a
million others were also waiting; but mostly just to see the pope,
rather than to listen to anything he might say.
</P>
<P>
   Most of what the pope has said in recent weeks has grated on
American ears. He has attacked America's policy of air strikes and
sanctions against Iraq and the decades-old embargo against Cuba. He
has advocated millennium forgiveness of Third-World debts, a
non-starter in Washington and on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's 1973 ruling establishing a woman's right to
abortion, although slightly chipped, remains the law of the land.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's opposition to the death penalty (underlined by his
appeal, made at mass in the cathedral, for ``a consensus to end the
death penalty, which is both cruel and unnecessary'') managed to
commute the execution of Darrell Mease, who was due to die by
lethal injection on the very day of the visit.
</P>
<P>
   The pontiff and the president talked alone for 20 minutes. What
they discussed is a mystery; it was said to include neither
President Clinton's private life nor his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   When the mayor of Rome (who bears a startling resemblance to
Clinton) received some sharp words in private from the pope about
the sanctity of marriage, he immediately decided to marry his
partner of 15 years. But it seems that Clinton may have been spared
that galvanizing message.
</P>
<P>
   One columnist, writing in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, pointed
out that John Paul II could never win office in America. His views
on abortion and his attitudes towards homosexuals and women would
sink him in a Democratic primary; and the Republicans could never
nominate a man who opposed the death penalty and favored curbing
the excesses of capitalism for the general social good.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if cheers were votes, the pope could have won any office in
St. Louis. His mass in the Trans World Dome and the adjoining
convention center was said to be the largest indoor event in
history, drawing more than 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the wild popularity of the pope in America stands in
almost inverse proportion to his influence. &QL;

STEVE FORBES: THE GOP'S NERDY NUDZH  
 
</HEADLINE>
   (This excellent 1,000-word ``separate buy'' profile of Steve Forbes
is from the current (week beginning 30 January 1999) Economist
magazine.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Silly slogans are the early-warning signals of an election
season, and the recent Conservative Political Action Conference was
full of them.
</P>
<P>
   T-shirts proclaimed ``Bauer Power'' in honor of powerless Gary
Bauer, a long-shot presidential aspirant. A stall sold Gore Blend
coffee, bland-tasting and decaffeinated. Stickers exhorted
conference-goers to ``Pave the Rainforest'' and ``Save the Male'';
another said, ``Don't steal, the government hates competition.''
</P>
<P>
   From all this pageantry, two conclusions flow. The first is that
the Republican primaries will be fun. The second is that the
ebullient clashes that they bring will be especially fun for
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   This second conclusion is reinforced by the contemplation of
Steve Forbes, one of several presidential hopefuls at this month's
conservative conference.
</P>
<P>
   At first sight, there is nothing fun about Forbes. His campaign
pamphlet, entitled ``A Strategy for America's Future,'' says
unfunny and unconvincing things like ``Tie the value of the dollar
to a fixed measure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign sticker says, boringly, FORBES; Forbes aides
say scintillating things such as, ``Steve is a real decent
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes himself has a nervous, wide-eyed stare, like an
accountant who has been plucked from the comforting tedium of his
spreadsheets and plonked before the TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for Democrats at least, the Forbes campaign affords a
cruel kind of humor. It is pointed and pointless at the same time:
it skewers other Republican hopefuls, but its own candidate seems
too gauche to make it to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts of Forbes, and others like him, ensure that
Republicans will spend much of the coming year beating each other
about the head. Meanwhile, on the Democratic side, Vice-President
Al Gore seems likely (for the time being, at least) to face barely
any serious primary opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes's speech to this month's conservative powwow gave a taste
of head-beatings to come. He railed against ``professional
politicians'' and the ``Republican establishment'' _ meaning his
own party's best candidates for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   He poured scorn upon ``the Washington political class and its
media pets'' _ meaning, presumably, Senator John McCain, a
telegenic Republican war hero who has expressed an interest in the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   And, repeatedly, Forbes denounced worn-out names from Republican
campaigns past, as well as the scions of political families.
</P>
<P>
   This was a way of lancing three rivals at once: Elizabeth Dole,
the wife of the Republican nominee in 1996; Dan Quayle, a former
vice-president; and, most of all, Governor George Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is the most charming and best-financed Republican around;
he runs America's second-most populous state; he is his party's
best hope of recapturing the White House. So Forbes strained
especially hard to damage him.
</P>
<P>
   He sneered at ex-President Bush, the father of the governor.
Daddy Bush promised a ``kinder and gentler'' conservatism; Forbes
lampooned the ``siren song of these mushy moderates.''
</P>
<P>
   Daddy Bush broke a promise not to raise taxes; Forbes boasted
that he comes from ``a family of tax-payers, not tax-raisers.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the younger Bush's talk of ``compassionate
conservatism,'' Forbes had this to say: ``Mealy-mouthed rhetoric
and poll-tested cliches are no substitute for a muscular,
substantive agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Forbes is not alone in his assault on Bush; other
Republican White House wannabes have gathered around, forming a
circular firing squad.
</P>
<P>
   The ``compassionate conservatism'' slogan is nothing more than
``weasel words,'' according to Lamar Alexander, the former
education secretary under President Bush; it is ``silly and
insulting,'' according to Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   But, of all the assailants, Forbes matters most. Despite his
gauche manner, he is the only one with the oomph to wound the
younger Bush seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes matters, first, because of money. He is the heir to the
Forbes publishing empire, and is prepared to spend his own millions
on his campaign. In 1996 Forbes entered the primaries late, and
spent his way to victory in two minor states. This time he will be
more formidable by far.
</P>
<P>
   He has been campaigning nonstop these past three years: he has
visited all 50 states, given more than 400 speeches, paid for 60
radio ad campaigns, and deluged journalists across the land with
tiresome press releases.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Forbes fortune will count for more than it did
last time around. The big-state primaries will happen almost
simultaneously in 2000, rather than being spread out, as they were
in 1996. This will make it impossible to campaign much in person:
expensive television ads will matter more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another reason why the Forbes campaign may
seriously wound Bush. The Texas governor may be charming, and
spectacularly good at the sweaty job of working crowds; but he is
short on striking policy proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, by contrast, is full of bold ideas. As in 1996, he wants
to scrap the tax code and replace it with a 17 percent flat tax,
free of loopholes and complex exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   As in 1996, he wants to replace health and pension entitlement
programs with individual savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In foreign policy, he delights hard-core Republicans by
denouncing multilateral institutions such as the IMF and the United
Nations, and by rekindling Ronald Reagan's enthusiasm for a
ballistic defense system.
</P>
<P>
   He is staunchly conservative on social issues: he opposes
abortion; he denounces euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, in sum, has ideas to please his party's social and
economic wings: he talks excitedly about ``rebuilding the Reagan
coalition.''
</P>
<P>
   If he were a charismatic man, he might well pull this off. But
he is too nerdy, and his inherited wealth makes him a disastrous
messenger for a reform that would abolish taxation on investments.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates _ governors and senators and former cabinet
members _ will assail the politically inexperienced Forbes for
regarding the presidency as an entry-level job.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a miracle, he will never make it to the White House. But
he may manage to wound his party rivals enough to ensure that none
of them gets there either. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Silly slogans are the early-warning signals of an election
season, and the recent Conservative Political Action Conference was
full of them.
</P>
<P>
   T-shirts proclaimed ``Bauer Power'' in honor of powerless Gary
Bauer, a long-shot presidential aspirant. A stall sold Gore Blend
coffee, bland-tasting and decaffeinated. Stickers exhorted
conference-goers to ``Pave the Rainforest'' and ``Save the Male'';
another said, ``Don't steal, the government hates competition.''
</P>
<P>
   From all this pageantry, two conclusions flow. The first is that
the Republican primaries will be fun. The second is that the
ebullient clashes that they bring will be especially fun for
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   This second conclusion is reinforced by the contemplation of
Steve Forbes, one of several presidential hopefuls at this month's
conservative conference.
</P>
<P>
   At first sight, there is nothing fun about Forbes. His campaign
pamphlet, entitled ``A Strategy for America's Future,'' says
unfunny and unconvincing things like ``Tie the value of the dollar
to a fixed measure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign sticker says, boringly, FORBES; Forbes aides
say scintillating things such as, ``Steve is a real decent
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes himself has a nervous, wide-eyed stare, like an
accountant who has been plucked from the comforting tedium of his
spreadsheets and plonked before the TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for Democrats at least, the Forbes campaign affords a
cruel kind of humor. It is pointed and pointless at the same time:
it skewers other Republican hopefuls, but its own candidate seems
too gauche to make it to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts of Forbes, and others like him, ensure that
Republicans will spend much of the coming year beating each other
about the head. Meanwhile, on the Democratic side, Vice-President
Al Gore seems likely (for the time being, at least) to face barely
any serious primary opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes's speech to this month's conservative powwow gave a taste
of head-beatings to come. He railed against ``professional
politicians'' and the ``Republican establishment'' _ meaning his
own party's best candidates for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   He poured scorn upon ``the Washington political class and its
media pets'' _ meaning, presumably, Senator John McCain, a
telegenic Republican war hero who has expressed an interest in the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   And, repeatedly, Forbes denounced worn-out names from Republican
campaigns past, as well as the scions of political families.
</P>
<P>
   This was a way of lancing three rivals at once: Elizabeth Dole,
the wife of the Republican nominee in 1996; Dan Quayle, a former
vice-president; and, most of all, Governor George Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is the most charming and best-financed Republican around;
he runs America's second-most populous state; he is his party's
best hope of recapturing the White House. So Forbes strained
especially hard to damage him.
</P>
<P>
   He sneered at ex-President Bush, the father of the governor.
Daddy Bush promised a ``kinder and gentler'' conservatism; Forbes
lampooned the ``siren song of these mushy moderates.''
</P>
<P>
   Daddy Bush broke a promise not to raise taxes; Forbes boasted
that he comes from ``a family of tax-payers, not tax-raisers.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the younger Bush's talk of ``compassionate
conservatism,'' Forbes had this to say: ``Mealy-mouthed rhetoric
and poll-tested cliches are no substitute for a muscular,
substantive agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Forbes is not alone in his assault on Bush; other
Republican White House wannabes have gathered around, forming a
circular firing squad.
</P>
<P>
   The ``compassionate conservatism'' slogan is nothing more than
``weasel words,'' according to Lamar Alexander, the former
education secretary under President Bush; it is ``silly and
insulting,'' according to Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   But, of all the assailants, Forbes matters most. Despite his
gauche manner, he is the only one with the oomph to wound the
younger Bush seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes matters, first, because of money. He is the heir to the
Forbes publishing empire, and is prepared to spend his own millions
on his campaign. In 1996 Forbes entered the primaries late, and
spent his way to victory in two minor states. This time he will be
more formidable by far.
</P>
<P>
   He has been campaigning nonstop these past three years: he has
visited all 50 states, given more than 400 speeches, paid for 60
radio ad campaigns, and deluged journalists across the land with
tiresome press releases.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Forbes fortune will count for more than it did
last time around. The big-state primaries will happen almost
simultaneously in 2000, rather than being spread out, as they were
in 1996. This will make it impossible to campaign much in person:
expensive television ads will matter more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another reason why the Forbes campaign may
seriously wound Bush. The Texas governor may be charming, and
spectacularly good at the sweaty job of working crowds; but he is
short on striking policy proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, by contrast, is full of bold ideas. As in 1996, he wants
to scrap the tax code and replace it with a 17 percent flat tax,
free of loopholes and complex exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   As in 1996, he wants to replace health and pension entitlement
programs with individual savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In foreign policy, he delights hard-core Republicans by
denouncing multilateral institutions such as the IMF and the United
Nations, and by rekindling Ronald Reagan's enthusiasm for a
ballistic defense system.
</P>
<P>
   He is staunchly conservative on social issues: he opposes
abortion; he denounces euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, in sum, has ideas to please his party's social and
economic wings: he talks excitedly about ``rebuilding the Reagan
coalition.''
</P>
<P>
   If he were a charismatic man, he might well pull this off. But
he is too nerdy, and his inherited wealth makes him a disastrous
messenger for a reform that would abolish taxation on investments.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates _ governors and senators and former cabinet
members _ will assail the politically inexperienced Forbes for
regarding the presidency as an entry-level job.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a miracle, he will never make it to the White House. But
he may manage to wound his party rivals enough to ensure that none
of them gets there either. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, CALIF. _ The earthquake which devastated central
Colombia on Jan. 25 took its thousands of victims by surprise. No
wonder, since predicting earth tremors is far from an exact
science.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of effort, most would-be earthquake forecasters
have concluded that it will never be possible to make specific
predictions of the precise time, location and intensity of a
seismic shake-up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they are pursuing statistical approaches, such as
estimating the chances that an earthquake of a particular size will
strike a given region within a certain period.
</P>
<P>
   So a promising new ``stress-transfer'' theory, which sets out to
explain how an earthquake in one place affects the probability of
subsequent earthquakes nearby, is causing a bit of a rumble.
</P>
<P>
   One of the theory's leading proponents, Ross Stein of the U.S.
Geological Survey, likes to explain its underlying principles with
a string of house bricks interconnected by elastic ``bungee''
cords.
</P>
<P>
   Having arranged the bricks in a line on a table, Dr. Stein
stands at one end and winds a small crank which tightens the cord
attached to the nearest brick.
</P>
<P>
   Once the tension in the cord exceeds the frictional force
preventing the brick from sliding along the table, the brick slips.
This causes the cord between the crank and the brick to go slack,
but tightens the cord between the brick and the next brick along
the line.
</P>
<P>
   As Dr. Stein continues to wind the crank, the bricks slip at
different times and by different amounts.
</P>
<P>
   As a whole, the system is unpredictable, but the movement of a
particular brick has a predictable effect on its two neighbors, one
of which becomes more likely to slip (as the cord between the two
tightens) and one of which becomes less likely to slip (as the cord
slackens).
</P>
<P>
   Earthquakes, says Dr. Stein, work in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   The constant turning of the crank corresponds to the inexorable
motion of the earth's tectonic plates, and each slip of a brick
represents an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Just as movement changes the tension of the cords, each
earthquake increases the stress in some nearby areas of the earth's
crust, and releases it in others.
</P>
<P>
   These small changes may not be enough to trigger subsequent
earthquakes immediately, but other earthquakes in the area become
more or less likely as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the particulars of an individual earthquake, the
stress changes it causes can be worked out using a computer model
of the region. The result is a color-coded map showing the change
in stress distribution _ and hence the change in probability of
subsequent earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   To test the theory, Dr. Stein, working with Geoffrey King at the
Institut de Physique du Globe in Paris, Jian Lin at Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts and Shinji Toda of the
Electric Power Industry in Chiba, Japan, have looked at records of
aftershocks following major earthquakes, including the ones in
Northridge, Calif. in 1994 and the Japanese city of Kobe in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   They chose to study aftershocks because there are thousands of
them, and their statistical theory needs lots of data to work
properly.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, aftershocks were found to congregate in the regions
of increased stress as predicted by the model, while in the regions
of reduced stress (called ``stress shadows'') the number of
aftershocks was very small.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests that even though the theory makes a number of
simplifying assumptions about the physical properties of the
earth's crust (for example, that it behaves like bricks and bungee
cords) there is a real link between changes in stress and the
probability of subsequent earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   As well as making short-term forecasts of aftershocks, the
theory can also be used to evaluate how a large earthquake changes
the long-term likelihood of other earthquakes in the region.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in a paper published in the Journal of Geophysical
Research, Dr. Stein and his team estimated that the Kobe earthquake
increased the probability that a similar major earthquake will
occur in the Osaka metropolitan area between 1997 and 2007 from 5
percent to as much as 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And although the timing of large earthquakes is as unpredictable
as ever, the stress-transfer theory's ability to predict the likely
locations of aftershocks could still be useful in the hours and
days after a major earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   With a modest increase in computing power, Dr. Stein says, the
forecasting algorithm (which currently runs on a desktop computer)
could be made to work in real time.
</P>
<P>
   Using data from automated sensors, a map showing areas most at
risk from aftershocks could then be generated and displayed on a
World Wide Web page within minutes of an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   The general public and the emergency services would obviously
prefer a precise prediction several days in advance, but any
warning is better than none at all. &QL;

 c.1999 Worth Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most American borrowers _ which is to say most American
homeowners _ down is up.
</P>
<P>
   However, the financial markets perform in the coming year, it's
very likely that the biggest financial opportunity for U.S.
consumers in 1999 will be the refinancing of their homes via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The math explains why mortgage lenders and brokers are swamped
with applications. The rate on a refinanced mortgage is likely to
be at least 160 basis points (1.6 percentage points) lower than the
original mortgage rate, approximately the yield on the stocks in
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the principal amount of the typical home mortgage
equals about two years' worth of the owner's income. Closing costs
average about 2 percent of the face value of the mortgage, or about
two weeks' salary.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, refinancing a mortgage is like investing two weeks' salary
to collect the dividends on a portfolio worth more than two years'
salary _ with no risk.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, a refinancing is as good as a salary increase for
most borrowers. Maybe better. While the major benefits-consulting
firms were forecasting 4.5 percent raises for 1999 only a few
months ago, economic angst may dampen that figure.
</P>
<P>
   But millions of homeowners will be able to increase their
spending power by more than 3 percent by refinancing _ even more if
they roll consumer debt into the new loan.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowers still have to deal with lenders, alas, and their
endless and intrusive requests for information. But at least the
Net brings some welcome anonymity to the seven-step process,
described below:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SCOUTING THE MARKET &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Before the Internet, the mortgage market consisted of whatever
the local lender or broker had to offer. But the Web allows
consumers to shop among mortgage lenders, comparing rates, fees,
maturities, and restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   A good place to start is the Federal Reserve site
(www.bog.frb.fed.us/releases). Download the ``historical data''
version of release H.15 to see if rates have risen or fallen in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Median home prices in cities across the country are available
through the ``NAR Press Releases'' link at www.realtimes.com.
Real-estate-information publisher HSH (www.hsh.com) features a
three-year graph of typical mortgage rates, a collection of
calculators, and a regularly updated report on average rates.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to compare what specific lenders are offering is
through the Web sites of mortgage brokers, most of which do
business with several lenders around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most active brokers are HomeShark (www.homeshark.com),
E-Loan (www.eloan.com), and QuickenMortgage
(www.quickenmortgage.com).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHECKING CREDIT &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Mortgage rates depend largely on the borrower's credit rating.
Quick credit tests can be found at www.mortgage-net.com and
www.hsh.com. And consumers can obtain a copy of their credit report
from www.creditreport-net.com.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest taking the test and foregoing the report: One of the
markdowns in credit scoring systems is the number of credit
inquiries in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHOOSING THE MORTGAGE YOU WANT &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, home mortgages came in one flavor: 30 years,
fixed rate. Now maturities on fixed-rate loans range from 15 to 30,
and rates can be fixed or vary according to changes in one of three
common indexes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are balloon notes payable in three, five, or
seven years and adjustable thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   The mortgage world is further subdivided into ``conforming''
loans (which carry principal amounts of $227,150 or less and are
eligible to be pooled and turned into tradable securities) and
``jumbo,'' or nonconforming, loans (which carry higher principal
amounts and interest rates).
</P>
<P>
   These days, fixed-rate mortgages have it all over
adjustable-rate mortgages. Adjustable-rate borrowers, after a
brief, low-rate introductory period, pay about 7.46 percent at a
time when fixed-rate borrowers are paying 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>

   &UR; QUALIFYING FOR THE LOAN &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A borrower now making a mortgage payment of $1,000 a month
should easily qualify for a new mortgage with a lower monthly
payment, right?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. The problem, at least with conforming loans, is often
something called the back-end ratio. This is the total of a
borrower's mortgage, home insurance, and real-estate tax payments
(which are usually limited to 28 percent of gross income), plus all
other fixed commitments _ car loans, credit-card debt, child
support, and the like.
</P>
<P>
   The combined total is limited to 36 percent of gross income. In
other words, non-home-buying commitments can't exceed 8 percent of
gross income. If they do, the mortgage amount is reduced
proportionately.
</P>
<P>
   It's not difficult to exceed 8 percent. Consider a two-earner
couple with a combined income of $100,000 who are financing two
$25,000 cars for five years at 8 percent. Their total monthly
payments will be $1,014 a month, or 12.2 percent of income.
</P>
<P>
   Add two credit-card balances of, say, $2,000 and minimum monthly
payments of $40 each, and they've lost another 1 percent. (Strictly
speaking, most lenders look at 10 months' worth of payments or so
to estimate the level of monthly installment debt.)
</P>
<P>
   With all these pitfalls, it's a good thing the Web is loaded
with qualification calculators. Two good ones can be found at

 By SCOTT BURNS  
 c.1999 Worth Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most American borrowers _ which is to say most American
homeowners _ down is up.
</P>
<P>
   However, the financial markets perform in the coming year, it's
very likely that the biggest financial opportunity for U.S.
consumers in 1999 will be the refinancing of their homes via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The math explains why mortgage lenders and brokers are swamped
with applications. The rate on a refinanced mortgage is likely to
be at least 160 basis points (1.6 percentage points) lower than the
original mortgage rate, approximately the yield on the stocks in
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the principal amount of the typical home mortgage
equals about two years' worth of the owner's income. Closing costs
average about 2 percent of the face value of the mortgage, or about
two weeks' salary.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, refinancing a mortgage is like investing two weeks' salary
to collect the dividends on a portfolio worth more than two years'
salary _ with no risk.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, a refinancing is as good as a salary increase for
most borrowers. Maybe better. While the major benefits-consulting
firms were forecasting 4.5 percent raises for 1999 only a few
months ago, economic angst may dampen that figure.
</P>
<P>
   But millions of homeowners will be able to increase their
spending power by more than 3 percent by refinancing _ even more if
they roll consumer debt into the new loan.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowers still have to deal with lenders, alas, and their
endless and intrusive requests for information. But at least the
Net brings some welcome anonymity to the seven-step process,
described below:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SCOUTING THE MARKET &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Before the Internet, the mortgage market consisted of whatever
the local lender or broker had to offer. But the Web allows
consumers to shop among mortgage lenders, comparing rates, fees,
maturities, and restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   A good place to start is the Federal Reserve site
(www.bog.frb.fed.us/releases). Download the ``historical data''
version of release H.15 to see if rates have risen or fallen in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Median home prices in cities across the country are available
through the ``NAR Press Releases'' link at www.realtimes.com.
Real-estate-information publisher HSH (www.hsh.com) features a
three-year graph of typical mortgage rates, a collection of
calculators, and a regularly updated report on average rates.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to compare what specific lenders are offering is
through the Web sites of mortgage brokers, most of which do
business with several lenders around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most active brokers are HomeShark (www.homeshark.com),
E-Loan (www.eloan.com), and QuickenMortgage
(www.quickenmortgage.com).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHECKING CREDIT &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Mortgage rates depend largely on the borrower's credit rating.
Quick credit tests can be found at www.mortgage-net.com and
www.hsh.com. And consumers can obtain a copy of their credit report
from www.creditreport-net.com.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest taking the test and foregoing the report: One of the
markdowns in credit scoring systems is the number of credit
inquiries in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHOOSING THE MORTGAGE YOU WANT &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, home mortgages came in one flavor: 30 years,
fixed rate. Now maturities on fixed-rate loans range from 15 to 30,
and rates can be fixed or vary according to changes in one of three
common indexes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are balloon notes payable in three, five, or
seven years and adjustable thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   The mortgage world is further subdivided into ``conforming''
loans (which carry principal amounts of $227,150 or less and are
eligible to be pooled and turned into tradable securities) and
``jumbo,'' or nonconforming, loans (which carry higher principal
amounts and interest rates).
</P>
<P>
   These days, fixed-rate mortgages have it all over
adjustable-rate mortgages. Adjustable-rate borrowers, after a
brief, low-rate introductory period, pay about 7.46 percent at a
time when fixed-rate borrowers are paying 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The new combination instruments also look pretty dubious right
about now, so homeowners should spend most of their search
comparing 15- and 30-year fixed-rate loans.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowers can shorten the terms by increasing the amount they
pay each month _ an idea popularized by Marc Eisenson in his book,
``The Banker's Secret,'' which can be ordered at
www.goodadvicepress.com.
</P>
<P>
   But most people hear about a money-grubbing variant on the idea,
the biweekly mortgage, hyped at www.usmr.com. I challenged the hype
in a newspaper column, archived at www.scottburns.com/980614su.htm.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DETERMINING FEES AND EXPENSES &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Most lenders on the Web now provide potential borrowers with a
list of closing fees and expenses. Make sure you comparison shop _

   Or will you? Visit CNET's Shopper.com, enter the description of

</P>
<P>
   Not just any list, but a shopping mega-list _ database-driven
and info-packed _ that's almost certain to save you time and money.
The list tells you what you'll pay at retailers from Irvine,
Calif., to Peabody, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, $521 is not the best price on that Nikon digital
camera, the Coolpix 600. Shopper.com lists 25 stores that carry the
product, as well as each store's phone number and location, the
approximate shipping cost, and the product's availability.
</P>
<P>
   One store wants $498.95, while another _ a popular mail-order
retailer _ wants $599.95. Complete information, or something close
to it. A shopper's dream.
</P>
<P>
   Think of Shopper.com and its brethren, the Web's
comparison-shopping sites, as search engines for products and, more
importantly, prices at far-flung merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Computers, books, CDs, toys, home electronics _ all the major
products peddled on the Web can be found at one of the
comparison-shopping sites, from Bottom Dollar to Robo Shopper.
</P>
<P>
   For price and convenience (those mantras of the serious
shopper), these sites just can't be beat, especially during the
holiday season, when mall frenzy disrupts suburban traffic patterns
and lines twist around cash registers in a consumption-crazed
version of Dante's ``Inferno.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't buy any products online, you can use these
sites to compare prices with those at your local retailer.
</P>
<P>
   That said, a few caveats are still in order:
</P>
<P>
   l) Avoid sites that list prices for only a few merchants. Either
the site's database is puny or, worse, the site charges merchants
to be listed. ``That's ultimately limiting,'' says James McQuivey,
an analyst at Forrester Research. ``The consumer will eventually
learn he's getting something that's fundamentally at odds with the
value the Internet provides.''
</P>
<P>
   2) Beware of stale information. The best sites reveal when a
price was last updated. Always confirm the price by phone or at the
merchant's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   3) Even at sites that don't charge merchants for listings,
expect some intermingling of objective information with
advertisements. At Shopper.com, the initial sale list places
sponsors at the top. Does that help you? Not at all. Choose the
``Re-sort by Price'' link.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes comparison shopping is integrated into search engines,
as at Excite. More common are stand-alone comparison-shopping
sites.
</P>
<P>
   In a year or two, expect to see comparison shopping everywhere
you turn on the Web: portal sites like Yahoo!, news and
entertainment sites, even personal home pages.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, these sites will provide entirely new ways of
deciding what to buy, allowing you to generate detailed
side-by-side comparisons, read customer reviews, and otherwise
match your desires with the right product.

ELWAY WON'T BE UPSTAGED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the days leading up to Super Bowl XXXIII, there were those
observers who could not envision the Denver Broncos losing to the
Atlanta Falcons because they could not envision John Elway being
outplayed by Chris Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   It was their view that the 37-year-old Elway, a certain future
Hall of Fame member who ranks among the great quarterbacks in
football history, simply would not allow himself to be upstaged in
a game of such magnitude against Chandler, a long-time journeyman
quarterback who has played with six teams in his 11 NFL seasons.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, did Michael Jordan ever take a pratfall in a
championship setting against, say, a Bryon Russell? Did Bill
Russell ever lose to a Darrall Imhoff? Would Tom Hanks blow an
Oscar to some itinerant character actor?
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, we should have known all along that John Elway,
in perhaps his farewell appearance in a sport he's ruled for 16
years, would dispense a masterpiece Sunday in artfully
choreographing the Broncos' 34-19 win over the Falcons at Pro
Player Stadium in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   We should have known all along that Elway would dissect the
Falcons' defense with short passes, long passes and medium range
passes to an assortment of receivers in a 18-for-29, 336-yard MVP
performance that had those millions who viewed it afterwards
wondering why Elway would even be considering what now seems to be
such a scandalously premature retirement.
</P>
<P>
   We should have known all along that Chandler, when the game was
still was within reach of his reeling team, would revert to the
inconsistent, interception-plagued form that has been a hallmark of
his career before this season and responsible for his unsettled
employment record.
</P>
<P>
   We should have known all along that Elway would flourish
brightly in the pressurized conditions of the Super Bowl, while
Chandler would stagger ignobly by throwing three interceptions and
by not being able to come up with vital plays when his team was in
desperate need of them.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in this match, pure and simple, was in the
quarterbacking, with the Broncos receiving extraordinary play from
theirs and the Falcons receiving from theirs a hapless guy giving a
haunting impersonation of such other memorable Super Bowl failures
as Neil O'Donnell, Stan Humphries, David Woodley and Tony Eason.
</P>
<P>
   This was Elway's fifth Super Bowl and never has he acquitted
himself better, as he coolly threw one deft pass another to Rod
Smith and Mike McCaffrey and even to the injured Shannon Sharpe's
replacement, Byron Chamberlain, and as he turned the proceedings
into a classic recital of his extraordinary skills.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler would have moments when he would resemble the fellow
who masterminded the upset of the Minnesota Vikings, but he had too
many moments when he would resemble the Chandler who for good
reason was so unwanted for so many years around the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   I swear each time the Falcons advanced deep into Denver
territory, Chandler would rise up to betray them with his faulty
work.
</P>
<P>
   If he had played anywhere near as consistently against the
Broncos as he did against the Vikings, the outcome of this one
would have been a lot closer.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Broncos easily covered the 7{-point spread and were
in control for most of the game, the Falcons on several occasions
in the final half were on the threshold of making matters
interesting only to be stymied by the bumbling of Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic disparity between these two teams in this
tedious affair could be found in the John Elway vs. Chris Chandler
matchup.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' running back Jamal Anderson (98 yards rushing) held
his own against his celebrated counterpart, Terrell Davis (102
yards).
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos' field goal kicker, Jason Elam, blew two easy field
goals, while the Falcons' Morten Andersen butchered only one from
point blank range.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams' offensive lines blocked well.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Broncos had the better of it on defense, but only
because of a huge assist from Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   There will be those who will trace the Falcons' fadeout to the
unfortunate experience their venerable safety and supposed team
spiritual leader, Mr. Eugene Robinson, endured Saturday evening
when he was busted by a vice cop and thrown into a Miami jail for
soliciting oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   It definitely gave those dreadful talking heads on Fox something
to bray about with their empty noggins during all those nauseous
hours of pre-game coverage---blessedly, I missed most of it because
I found arranging my socks chromatically to be far more
intellectually stimulating---but I doubt if Mr. Robinson's alleged
moral indiscretion caused Chandler to keep throwing passes into the
waiting hands of the Broncos' cornerback, Darien Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Robinson was beaten for a long touchdown when Rod Smith ran
by him to haul in a perfect Elway pass, but Smith and Elway have
beaten a lot of defenders across the seasons on such a play.
</P>
<P>
   And I doubt if Robinson had anything to do with the predictable
Falcon play-calling in the first half when the team twice was
stopped on third and one and once on fourth and one when its coach,
Dan Reeves, should have had Andersen attempting what would have
been a short field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reeves didn't exactly come up with an enlightened game plan
in his well-publicized showdown against the man he once fired, Mike
Shanahan, but I'm not sure it would have made any difference had he
done so.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Falcons' misfortune to face John Elway on a day when
it was all working for him, when his passes were on target, when
his blockers were giving him the necessary time, when his receivers
were latching on to every throw in their vicinity, when he seemed
magically charmed by the fates.
</P>
<P>
   Why is this guy considering permanently hanging up his cleats?
</P>
<P>
   He's on a talented team whose mightiest performer, Terrell
Davis, is a mere 26, and still is in his peak years.
</P>
<P>
   He's quite healthy.
</P>
<P>
   He could become the first quarterback in NFL history to win
three straight Super Bowls, a watershed achievement that has to
appeal to his competitive instincts.
</P>
<P>
   And, as the Atlanta Falcons and a worldwide audience graphically
were shown, John Elway still can pass and lead and spur his team to
heights quite befitting his own unique persona.

   Who besides Dr. Seuss's Grinch would impose a penalty on gift
giving? The U.S. government, of course, which makes sure that the
generous have to worry about not just income taxes but gift taxes
as well.
</P>
<P>
   An unpleasant light was briefly shone on the tax treatment of
gifts last year when baseball fans began wondering aloud whether
someone who gave St. Louis Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire back his
62nd-home-run ball would be liable for a gift tax.
</P>
<P>
   Proving just how tricky gift-tax rules can be, the IRS made two
different statements within 48 hours about tax liability. At first
the donor owed big time, then he or she was off the hook. The ball
was retrieved by an employee of the Cardinals, ending the debate.
</P>
<P>
   For people making more prosaic gifts, there are still several
considerations to keep in mind.
</P>
<P>
   If you give any one person a gift worth more than $10,000, you
will have to file a gift-tax return. But that doesn't mean you'll
actually have to pay tax on the gift this year. Instead, the effect
of the gift tax will be to reduce the amount (currently $625,000)
that can be transferred free of estate tax at the time of your
death.
</P>
<P>
   You can give up to $10,000 to an unlimited number of people
without worrying about gift tax. If you're married, you and your
spouse can give $20,000 to any individual without having to file a
gift-tax return, but you must file Form 709 to notify the IRS of
the ``split gift.''
</P>
<P>
   One other goody: There's no limit on the size of your gift if
it's for tuition or medical care. So feel free to pick up the cost
of your grandchild's Ivy League education. You'll want to be sure
to write the check to the institution, though, and not to the
individual.
</P>
<P>
   You may want to give a child or other relative non-appreciating
assets, such as cash, instead of appreciating assets like stocks.
Reason: Whoever receives your gift of an appreciating asset will
have the same cost basis that you had.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you bought $1,000 worth of stock that is now worth $7,000,
the recipient of that gift will have to pay income tax on
everything above $1,000 when the stock is sold,'' says Ed O'Hanlon,
a certified public accountant in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you hold the stock until you die, the recipient will
get it with a stepped-up basis _ that is, the value of the stock at
your death. If you're not otherwise subject to estate taxes, that
can be a better deal for the person you want to have the stock.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you are going to have a large estate,
making a gift of an appreciating asset can be beneficial in the
long term.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get that future appreciation out of your estate,'' says
Bruno Graziano, senior analyst with tax-guide publisher CCH. ``The
appreciation will be taxable to the recipient, but that tax could
be less than the tax your estate might have to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   If you give someone a painting, jewelry, or other rarity, you'll
need to have it appraised. ``I would recommend getting three
independent appraisals and going with the middle or average of the
three,'' says Mark Rigotti, a CPA in Taylor, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The appraisal value _ which should be the amount for which you
could sell the item on the open market _ is the amount you will
declare on any gift-tax return.
</P>
<P>
   The best news of all: There are no gift taxes on contributions
to qualified charities. Happy donating.  &LR;  &QL;

 By DAVE CALIFANO  
 c.1999 Worth Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A dead-in-the-water stock investment is no fun. But when you own
more than 17 percent of the stock in question, at least you get to
punish somebody.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, when it became clear that the aggressive growth
projections trumpeted by Sunbeam chief Albert Dunlap were just so
much balloon juice, money manager Michael Price demanded Dunlap's
swollen head. And Price's 17.5 million Sunbeam shares ensured that
he got it.
</P>
<P>
   But what about smaller investors? In absolute terms, they may
not have as much at stake as a major player like Price, but their
losses can be just as painful, if not more so.
</P>
<P>
   Do they stand a chance of making their voices heard when they
think one of their companies is being mismanaged?
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly enough, yes. Just ask Nell Minow, a principal in
Lens, an activist investment fund based in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1992, Lens was the extremely dissatisfied owner of a
tiny percentage of Sears, Roebuck stock. The source of Minow's
discontent: the Sears board, which essentially stood by while the
company frittered away its franchise as Middle America's retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Fed up, Lens took out a full-page ad in The Wall Street Journal
accusing Sears's directors, by name, of being ``non-performing
assets.''
</P>
<P>
   Just days after the ad ran, Sears held its annual meeting, where
a stunningly large percentage of the company's normally docile
stockholders endorsed Minow's plan to return the Big Store to its
retailing roots.
</P>
<P>
   She proposed that the company jettison its Dean Witter
financial-services arm and its Coldwell Banker real-estate unit. In
1993, Sears did just that.
</P>
<P>
   Minow's tactics aren't usually so flashy or brash, but they all
are designed to send the same message. ``Everything I do is to let
the company know that it's being observed,'' says Minow. ``Once
this happens, it reacts differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Another principle of effective shareholder activism is that
frontal assaults are rarely successful. ``You have to go through
the back door,'' confirms Amy Domini of Domini Social Investments.
</P>
<P>
   One of her favorite tactics is to introduce resolutions for
shareholders to consider at a company's annual meeting. The best
resolutions are the ones that promise, if passed, to make
management's lives miserable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll file a resolution on a sensitive matter like management
compensation,'' says Domini, ``and only agree to withdraw it if the
company will speak to us about the issues we're really concerned
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite pressure tactic is what's called the 220 demand
letter. Many companies are incorporated in Delaware because of that
state's pro-management legal code. But one key part of the code is
actually a shareholder's best friend.
</P>
<P>
   Under section 220 of Delaware General Corporation Law, investors
can, upon written request, inspect the books and records of any
company whose stock they own.
</P>
<P>
   Lens recently played the 220 card against Juno Lighting, a
company in which Lens holds 721,000 shares. Concerned about the
dearth of outsiders on the company's board, Lens had for months
pressed Juno to appoint several outside directors.
</P>
<P>
   Juno agreed, but the effort proceeded slowly until Minow fired
off a 220 letter demanding to see all records pertaining to the
company's search. Juno subsequently opened a line of communication
with Lens, but Minow hasn't let up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management's credibility is questionable,'' she says, ``and I
am currently drafting a shareholder proposal and preparing for a
proxy fight in case they don't keep their promises. As Reagan said,
`Trust, but verify.'''
</P>
<P>
   Minow expects shareholders to become even more aggressive about
defending their interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investing is not just about being smart in finding value
anymore,'' she says. ``It's also about being smart in creating
value.'' And if creating value means playing rough sometimes, hey,
that's business.  &LR;  &QL;

   A dead-in-the-water stock investment is no fun. But when you own
more than 17 percent of the stock in question, at least you get to
punish somebody.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, when it became clear that the aggressive growth
projections trumpeted by Sunbeam chief Albert Dunlap were just so
much balloon juice, money manager Michael Price demanded Dunlap's
swollen head. And Price's 17.5 million Sunbeam shares ensured that
he got it.
</P>
<P>
   But what about smaller investors? In absolute terms, they may
not have as much at stake as a major player like Price, but their
losses can be just as painful, if not more so.
</P>
<P>
   Do they stand a chance of making their voices heard when they
think one of their companies is being mismanaged?
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly enough, yes. Just ask Nell Minow, a principal in
Lens, an activist investment fund based in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1992, Lens was the extremely dissatisfied owner of a
tiny percentage of Sears, Roebuck stock. The source of Minow's
discontent: the Sears board, which essentially stood by while the
company frittered away its franchise as Middle America's retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Fed up, Lens took out a full-page ad in The Wall Street Journal
accusing Sears's directors, by name, of being ``non-performing
assets.''
</P>
<P>
   Just days after the ad ran, Sears held its annual meeting, where
a stunningly large percentage of the company's normally docile
stockholders endorsed Minow's plan to return the Big Store to its
retailing roots.
</P>
<P>
   She proposed that the company jettison its Dean Witter
financial-services arm and its Coldwell Banker real-estate unit. In
1993, Sears did just that.
</P>
<P>
   Minow's tactics aren't usually so flashy or brash, but they all
are designed to send the same message. ``Everything I do is to let
the company know that it's being observed,'' says Minow. ``Once
this happens, it reacts differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Another principle of effective shareholder activism is that
frontal assaults are rarely successful. ``You have to go through
the back door,'' confirms Amy Domini of Domini Social Investments.
</P>
<P>
   One of her favorite tactics is to introduce resolutions for
shareholders to consider at a company's annual meeting. The best
resolutions are the ones that promise, if passed, to make
management's lives miserable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll file a resolution on a sensitive matter like management
compensation,'' says Domini, ``and only agree to withdraw it if the
company will speak to us about the issues we're really concerned
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite pressure tactic is what's called the 220 demand
letter. Many companies are incorporated in Delaware because of that
state's pro-management legal code. But one key part of the code is
actually a shareholder's best friend.
</P>
<P>
   Under section 220 of Delaware General Corporation Law, investors
can, upon written request, inspect the books and records of any
company whose stock they own.
</P>
<P>
   Lens recently played the 220 card against Juno Lighting, a
company in which Lens holds 721,000 shares. Concerned about the
dearth of outsiders on the company's board, Lens had for months
pressed Juno to appoint several outside directors.
</P>
<P>
   Juno agreed, but the effort proceeded slowly until Minow fired
off a 220 letter demanding to see all records pertaining to the
company's search. Juno subsequently opened a line of communication
with Lens, but Minow hasn't let up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management's credibility is questionable,'' she says, ``and I
am currently drafting a shareholder proposal and preparing for a
proxy fight in case they don't keep their promises. As Reagan said,
`Trust, but verify.'''
</P>
<P>
   Minow expects shareholders to become even more aggressive about
defending their interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investing is not just about being smart in finding value
anymore,'' she says. ``It's also about being smart in creating
value.'' And if creating value means playing rough sometimes, hey,
that's business.  &LR;  &QL;

ELWAY WON'T BE UPSTAGED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the days leading up to Super Bowl XXXIII, there were those
observers who could not envision the Denver Broncos losing to the
Atlanta Falcons because they could not envision John Elway being
outplayed by Chris Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   It was their view that the 37-year-old Elway, a certain future
Hall of Fame member who ranks among the great quarterbacks in
football history, simply would not allow himself to be upstaged in
a game of such magnitude against Chandler, a long-time journeyman
quarterback who has played with six teams in his 11 NFL seasons.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, did Michael Jordan ever take a pratfall in a
championship setting against, say, a Bryon Russell? Did Bill
Russell ever lose to a Darrall Imhoff? Would Tom Hanks blow an
Oscar to some itinerant character actor?
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, we should have known all along that John Elway,
in perhaps his farewell appearance in a sport he's ruled for 16
years, would dispense a masterpiece Sunday in artfully
choreographing the Broncos' 34-19 win over the Falcons at Pro
Player Stadium in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   We should have known all along that Elway would dissect the
Falcons' defense with short passes, long passes and medium range
passes to an assortment of receivers in a 18-for-29, 336-yard MVP
performance that had those millions who viewed it afterwards
wondering why Elway would even be considering what now seems to be
such a scandalously premature retirement.
</P>
<P>
   We should have known all along that Chandler, when the game was
still was within reach of his reeling team, would revert to the
inconsistent, interception-plagued form that has been a hallmark of
his career before this season and responsible for his unsettled
employment record.
</P>
<P>
   We should have known all along that Elway would flourish
brightly in the pressurized conditions of the Super Bowl, while
Chandler would stagger ignobly by throwing three interceptions and
by not being able to come up with vital plays when his team was in
desperate need of them.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in this match, pure and simple, was in the
quarterbacking, with the Broncos receiving extraordinary play from
theirs and the Falcons receiving from theirs a hapless guy giving a
haunting impersonation of such other memorable Super Bowl failures
as Neil O'Donnell, Stan Humphries, David Woodley and Tony Eason.
</P>
<P>
   This was Elway's fifth Super Bowl and never has he acquitted
himself better, as he coolly threw one deft pass another to Rod
Smith and Mike McCaffrey and even to the injured Shannon Sharpe's
replacement, Byron Chamberlain, and as he turned the proceedings
into a classic recital of his extraordinary skills.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler would have moments when he would resemble the fellow
who masterminded the upset of the Minnesota Vikings, but he had too
many moments when he would resemble the Chandler who for good
reason was so unwanted for so many years around the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   I swear each time the Falcons advanced deep into Denver
territory, Chandler would rise up to betray them with his faulty
work.
</P>
<P>
   If he had played anywhere near as consistently against the
Broncos as he did against the Vikings, the outcome of this one
would have been a lot closer.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Broncos easily covered the 7{-point spread and were
in control for most of the game, the Falcons on several occasions
in the final half were on the threshold of making matters
interesting only to be stymied by the bumbling of Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic disparity between these two teams in this
tedious affair could be found in the John Elway vs. Chris Chandler
matchup.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' running back Jamal Anderson (98 yards rushing) held
his own against his celebrated counterpart, Terrell Davis (102
yards).
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos' field goal kicker, Jason Elam, blew two easy field
goals, while the Falcons' Morten Andersen butchered only one from
point blank range.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams' offensive lines blocked well.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Broncos had the better of it on defense, but only
because of a huge assist from Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   There will be those who will trace the Falcons' fadeout to the
unfortunate experience their venerable safety and supposed team
spiritual leader, Mr. Eugene Robinson, endured Saturday evening
when he was busted by a vice cop and thrown into a Miami jail for
soliciting oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   It definitely gave those dreadful talking heads on Fox something
to bray about with their empty noggins during all those nauseous
hours of pre-game coverage---blessedly, I missed most of it because
I found arranging my socks chromatically to be far more
intellectually stimulating---but I doubt if Mr. Robinson's alleged
moral indiscretion caused Chandler to keep throwing passes into the
waiting hands of the Broncos' cornerback, Darien Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Robinson was beaten for a long touchdown when Rod Smith ran
by him to haul in a perfect Elway pass, but Smith and Elway have
beaten a lot of defenders across the seasons on such a play.
</P>
<P>
   And I doubt if Robinson had anything to do with the predictable
Falcon play-calling in the first half when the team twice was
stopped on third and one and once on fourth and one when its coach,
Dan Reeves, should have had Andersen attempting what would have
been a short field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reeves didn't exactly come up with an enlightened game plan
in his well-publicized showdown against the man he once fired, Mike
Shanahan, but I'm not sure it would have made any difference had he
done so.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Falcons' misfortune to face John Elway on a day when
it was all working for him, when his passes were on target, when
his blockers were giving him the necessary time, when his receivers
were latching on to every throw in their vicinity, when he seemed
magically charmed by the fates.
</P>
<P>
   Why is this guy considering permanently hanging up his cleats?
</P>
<P>
   He's on a talented team whose mightiest performer, Terrell
Davis, is a mere 26, and still is in his peak years.
</P>
<P>
   He's quite healthy.
</P>
<P>
   He could become the first quarterback in NFL history to win
three straight Super Bowls, a watershed achievement that has to
appeal to his competitive instincts.
</P>
<P>
   And, as the Atlanta Falcons and a worldwide audience graphically
were shown, John Elway still can pass and lead and spur his team to
heights quite befitting his own unique persona.

DAVIS BEGINS TRADE-SEEKING MEXICO TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Gov. Gray Davis and a contingent of state leaders
arrive here Monday on a three-day trip to jump start
Mexico-California relations _ and they need only to look across the
street from their hotel to glimpse the business possibilities lying
in wait for them.
</P>
<P>
   That is the site of the historic Chapultepec Castle _ better
known to Americans as the punk-populated House of Capulet in the
hit film, ``William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet'' starring
Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, surrounding Davis' Hotel Marquis Reforma headquarters
are the same Mexico City streets that served as the gritty urban
backdrop for the 1997 Hollywood flick, and leading Mexican
entertainment executives like Rodrigo Gonzalez _ who are keenly
aware of Davis' arrival _ couldn't be happier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entertainment arena is growing substantially in California
and Mexico,'' said Gonzalez, general director of Mexico City's
entertainment giant Corporacion Interamericana de Entretenimiento
(CIE), whose firm has distributed U.S. films such as Spike Lee's
``He Got Game'' in Latin America. ``We're hoping for a lot more
business _ coming and going.''
</P>
<P>
   That is Davis' hope too.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this trip, the governor is looking to find ways to help
companies already doing business here and to open the doors for
others in high-tech, entertainment and agriculture and other areas
who want to work here,'' his press secretary, Michael Bustamante,
said Sunday in the suite overlooking the historic castle.
``Clearly, from a relationship-building standpoint, this trip is
important because the result will be greater trade and more jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Filmmaking is one area where the state still holds a competitive
advantage over Texas, which benefited mightily from Mexico's
strained relations with California during the tenure of former
Governor Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican leaders are more than happy to remind California
visitors that some of Hollywood's biggest hits have a ``Made in
Mexico'' label. The pricey blockbuster ``Titanic'' _ all $200
million worth _ would have cost far more if it had not been filmed
in Rosarito, Baja California, and on the back lots of Mexico City's
own Churubusco Studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mask of Zorro'' starring Antonio Banderas, ``Clear and
Present Danger'' with Harrison Ford, were both shot in Mexico:
``Honey I Shrunk the Kids'' was a product of Churubusco's
set-building genius and new high-tech imports _ all evidence of the
Mexico-Hollywood connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the areas that has the most potential,'' said
Gonzalez, whose firm, fresh from a joint venture and infusion of
investment capital, he said, hopes to distribute more Mexican-made
films in California and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen percent of your box office _ $1 billion _ is made up
of Latin consumers,'' Gonzalez noted. ``There hasn't been a big
outflow of Mexican productions _ and we hope some of these products
will flow through California, to good potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Davis' visit to Mexico is the kind of official trip _
including a meeting with President Ernesto Zedillo _ that Wilson
never made, it may not result in such sexy deals immediately,
experts say. But to steal the famous line from ``Casablanca,'' it
could be the start of a beautiful friendship.
</P>
<P>
   ``These three days, by themselves, are really about laying the
groundwork for the myriad of opportunities that are out there,''
said Democratic Assemblywoman Denise Ducheny of National City,
Calif., who will accompany Davis. She said that, beyond
entertainment, she hopes to see environmental, academic, and
business links at all levels. ``This is the first level of
establishing a relationship with personal trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Other business leaders, too, say it is the open door they have
been waiting for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, nobody ever invited me to go down as a business
leader in communications and radio when the previous governor was
in residence,'' said Norman Pattiz, who chairs Westwood One, the
Los Angeles-based radio network giant and who is also a member of
the delegation. ``I live in Los Angeles, where the top three
stations are Hispanic. That's a very important area for us, and
we're looking for the opportunity to distribute Spanish-language
programming.''
</P>
<P>
   Pattiz said the trip comes at a time when ``there's no question
that this is a very important market that needs more attention paid
to it. . . . This focus is long overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who is accompanied by 19 business, academic and political
leaders and a few dozen members of the media, is slated to start
work tomorrow by meeting with Zedillo. He is also scheduled to hold
a session with Mexican Secretary of Education Miguel Limon Rojas.
</P>
<P>
   Among others along on the trip are Bruce Karatz, president and
chief executive officer of Kaufman and Broad; Ron Burkle, the
Ralph's supermarket magnate and a leading Democratic party donor;
and Richard Atkinson, the president of the University of
California.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the group heads to the financial center of
Monterrey, where there will be discussions with a broad spectrum of
top officials, including Mexican Secretary of Economic Development
Carlos Zambrano Plant. Davis plans to visit a leading business
administration school, then tour NEMAK, an automobile parts
manufacturing plant.
</P>
<P>
   Even before his arrival here, the Mexican press has been
enthusiastic about the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a very positive response,'' said Delia Lopez, the
entertainment attache for the California State Office of Trade and
Development here. ``The message is that this is a way to restart a
relationship that has been hurt _ and they're looking forward to
what (Davis) has to say to make things better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited to see Governor Davis coming to Mexico because
it's important for him to have a broader view of what Mexico can do
with California,'' said Gonzalez, whose CIE ranks as Mexico's
leading entertainment promoter. The company sponsors California
tours of such Latin entertainment superstars as Luis Miguel. Once
California and Mexico establish a better bond, he said, the ripple
effects in these and other industries may continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the fastest-growing markets, for us, not only has been
the Latin population in the States, but in South America,'' he
said. ``Obviously, we see tremendous potential.''

   1. HOW NOT TO GET KILLED ON DEADLINE In ``hostile environment''
school, foreign correspondents and reporters learn how to improve
their chances of surviving kidnappings, cross-fires, ambushes and
other perils of the workplace. Here are things they never learned
in journalism school. By Ian Fisher. From The New York Times
Magazine. 1,800 words. 2. AN ESCAPE FROM AUSCHWITZ: A LOVE STORY
FOR THE AGES It sounds like a movie script, part ``Great Escape''
and part ``Love Story,'' only better, but it is true. It is a story
of love and bravery, the tale of how a young Polish patriot,
imprisoned by the Nazis in the Auschwitz death camp, fell in love
with a beautiful young Jewish girl and, certain that she was
doomed, improvised a daring escape. It is the story of how the two
were then separated, each certain the other had died, and went
their separate ways. And it is the story of how, decades later ...
but no, the story is too good to give the ending away. From Der
Spiegel. 2,000 words. (English translation available.) 3. WHERE DID
AIDS COME FROM? The origin of the virus HIV-1, the main cause of
the worldwide AIDS epidemic, has been a matter of debate ever since
its discovery in 1983. Its origins in wild primates (apes and
monkeys) has long been accepted, but which ones and how could it
have been transmitted? The first question has now been answered. By
Eleanor Lawrence. Nature News Service. 1,000 words. (N/A France and
Spain.)

Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who knows Clinton personally. From Cambio
magazine. 2,000 words. (English translation available.) Not
available Colombia, Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela, Spain, Italy, Peru,

A RETURN TO ASIAN VALUES - AND VEGETARIANISM When her son became a
vegetarian at age 9, it was not easy for Rekha Basu. She believed
in vegetarianism in principle, especially in Asian countries like
India, where it has prevailed for thousands of years and seems to
work better with the ecology, economics and culture. Now she is
sure. With Bic Macs and red meat being introduced to Asian
countries, obesity is springing up in places it was never seen
before and land-use is driven by the much less efficient need to
feed cattle than humans. By Reka Basu. New America News Service.

WHY AMERICA NEEDS TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE
</P>
<P>
   FARAWAY CIVIL WARS The threat of war in Europe now looms as
likely as ever, as elections return Bosnian hardliners to office
and violence flares in Kosovo. The prospects of achieving a lasting
peace in the region are slim, and these problems are likely to vex

PROBING THE PAST If you want to see a time machine, go to room 2677
in the geology building at UCLA where there is a 5-foot-tall,
20-foot-wide piece of equipment housed in stainless steel. It will
not, however, accept human passengers. What goes inside is a flake
of rock. By analyzing the atoms in the rock, this machine can take
you back to the time when the Himalayas were formed, or when life
appeared on Earth. By Kathy A. Svitil. Discover magazine. 1,000
words + photos. 9. REDEFINING QUALITY TIME The idea of ``quality
time'' is meant to be reassuring to busy parents. It suggests that
even if your time with your children is limited, when you use it
wisely you can make up for a lack of ``quantity time.'' This
article takes a closer look at what quality time really is. By
Frances La Barre. From Child magazine. 1,500 words. 10. WHAT NOT TO
BUY FOR BABY A sort of shopping psychosis overtakes the mind of a
father fresh from the delivery room. Here's a quick guide to what
you need and what you don't. By Jeffrey Goldberg. Slate. 1,300

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Baseball diplomacy an insult to exiles
 &HT;    For release Feb. 3, 1999.
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The ping-pong diplomacy promoted between the United
States and China in the Kissinger '70s opened doors to the Asiatic
communist monolith that remain open today, thereby allowing us to
look in on a continuation of harsh rule and zero tolerance toward
dissent.
</P>
<P>
   And now, under the guise of increased people-to-people contact
with Cuba, the State Department and Baltimore Orioles owner Peter
Angelos are working to open some doors to the Caribbean communist
monolith _ with a series of baseball games. In this case, however,
we already know of the harshness of Castro's rule; there are
hundreds of thousands of Cuban exiles in Miami to document it.
</P>
<P>
   What happens as a result of the Orioles visiting Havana in late
March will have little effect in Salt Lake City, Tulsa, Minneapolis
or Pittsburgh. But it will have a considerable impact in Miami,
which is the capital of the Cuban Diaspora.
</P>
<P>
   What makes matters worse is that the Orioles, by quirk of
inter-league play, are scheduled to come to Miami June 7, 8 and 9
to play the Florida Marlins. I assure any and all that if the
Orioles make good on their intent to play in Cuba, likely in front
of Fidel Castro himself, that the reception they get in Miami in
June will be beyond rude, perhaps violent.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, Miami's recent history is scarred by fierce
Cuban exile reaction to entertainers who have performed in Cuba.
More than one concert has been canceled here, the result of exile
aversion.
</P>
<P>
   While it is easy to identify these actions as being distasteful
to the American way of life _ whatever that is these days _ one
needs to better understand the exiled Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   There are many things about them that do not sit well with me,
their own failure to accept the tenets of our Constitution's First
Amendment chief among them.
</P>
<P>
   But they also must be understood as a people who endure the
emptiness of a lost country, separated families, appropriated
properties, the failure of the Bay of Pigs and of U.S. Neutrality
Acts that freeze them in a vacuum of non-counterrevolutionary
existence.
</P>
<P>
   They watch with anguish as other nations have normal relations
with a country that denies its people the slightest token of
dissent, as new hotels rise with foreign funds, and as U.S.
companies, hoping not to be left out of a new Cuba, seek ways to
divert the four-decades-long boycott the U.S. has placed on the
communist island.
</P>
<P>
   The most rabid Cuban exiles would seek to strengthen that
boycott, but the reality of it is that it isn't doing much to
crumble Castro, that the Cubans are getting enough help from
elsewhere, and that the boycott itself remains a perfect receptacle
into which Castro places his excuses for the failure of his rule.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the Cuban-Americans have achieved in this country, they
have done it on their own; they came over with but the shirts on
their backs _ stripped to the economic bone by Castro. What
happened to Cuba since 1959 is seen by Cuban exiles as their
personal holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how damning the reports on Cuba from Human Rights
Watch, no matter how documented the evidence of political prisoners
and earlier kangaroo court executions, Castro mesmerizes the
non-exile world with his charisma. Even baseball owner Angelos is
trying to get into the act, delayed still by haggling with the
communist regime over percentage of profits such a series would
bring.
</P>
<P>
   It is likely that the Orioles will go to Havana, but it is an
insult to all those Cuban-borns in Miami and those also playing in
the major leagues today who, along with their families, have
suffered Castro. And to add to it by bringing the Orioles into the
anti-Castro hotbed of Miami in June is to rub salt in a very open
wound or, worse, to enrage the wounded tiger even more.

THE RISING TIDE OF `DAWSON'S CREEK' 
</HEADLINE>
  Includes a color slide of James Van Der Beek and Michelle Williams
in a scene from ``Dawson's Creek.'' 
 By SIMON HOUPT  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's late at night, and Dawson Leery has just climbed through
Jennifer Lindley's bedroom window.
</P>
<P>
   As crickets chirp outside, he whispers to her with a throaty
desperation, saying something about love and lust. The two
teen-agers kiss _ tentatively at first, then with a greater
intensity and, it seems, a fair amount of tongue action.
</P>
<P>
   Jen's teddy bear falls silently to the floor ... and she starts
to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cut!'' the director hollers. ``Why is it that everyone who
kisses James can't help laughing?''
</P>
<P>
   James, of course, is James Van Der Beek, the cuter-than-cute
actor who plays the lead role on one of television's hottest shows,
the WB network's ``Dawson's Creek.'' In less than a year, the show
has gone from being a midseason replacement on a marginal network
to an authentic hit, especially popular with the highly
sought-after teen market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy. It was just this little show we were doing down
here in Wilmington, N.C.,'' says Van Der Beek, who at 21 is the
eldest of the four main cast members. ``We never expected it to be
this big ... All of a sudden we were on billboards, and it started
to dawn on us _ `Wow, I can't believe how many people are
watching.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the pilot, 15-year-old Jen (Michelle Williams) arrived in the
fictional town of Capeside, Mass., next door to Dawson, setting his
hormones jumping. After a few heavy kisses, the two broke up and it
wasn't long before Dawson turned to a blossoming romance with his
longtime friend, the tomboyish Joey Potter (Katie Holmes).
</P>
<P>
   But this season has seen a reversal of fortune: After Joey
unexpectedly dumped him, Dawson has once again fallen for Jen's
seductive allure.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like pure soap opera, but that leaves out the impact of
screenwriting phenom Kevin Williamson, the creative force behind
the show and one of its executive producers. The screenwriter of
hit movies such as ``Scream'' (1996), ``I Know What You Did Last
Summer'' (1997) and ``Halloween: H2O'' (1998), he based the
television series loosely on his own adolescence in tiny New Bern,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Modeled after Williamson himself, Dawson is an angst-ridden
16-year-old who aspires to be the next Steven Spielberg. Or maybe,
to judge from the movie posters in his bedroom, the next Kevin
Williamson.
</P>
<P>
   The hip, media-savvy intelligence that has the fictional Dawson
admiring the work of his own creator is part of the show's appeal.
``Dawson's Creek'' takes the emotional turmoil of adolescence
seriously, but always knows when to drop in an entertaining
pop-culture reference. One episode, which had all four of the kids
serving time in Saturday detention, was a nod to the seminal Brat
Pack flick ``The Breakfast Club'' (1985).
</P>
<P>
   But fans most often justify their addiction by pointing to the
show's crisp, hyper-realistic dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been shows that have captured exactly the way teens
speak, word for word, like `My So-Called Life,''' Van Der Beek says
during a break in shooting. ``Our characters speak the way
everybody feels, the way people would speak if they had a day to go
over an argument in their head, pull out a thesaurus and then go
back and give someone their comeback.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very eloquent teen-agers and we have taken a sound
beating for that,'' agrees 20-year-old Joshua Jackson, who plays
Pacey Witter, Dawson's wisecracking best friend. ``These kids may
speak with the intellect and the language of a 30-year-old, but
they still have the emotional core of 15- and 16-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why people who are older than the kids are watching the
show,'' Jackson adds. ``And that's why 15-year-olds watch the show
as well, because they can relate on a one-to-one basis with what
we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just 'cause we're talking about sex,'' Williams
says, drawing a laugh from her co-stars.
</P>
<P>
   More seriously, Katie Holmes adds, ``I just think everyone can
relate to first kisses and the confusion of being a teen-ager.''
</P>
<P>
   Off camera, the actors describe themselves as the best of
friends. That's part of Williams' problem with the kissing scene,
actually.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strange situation,'' she says, ``to be in front of a
large crew and kissing somebody that you're intimate with on a
friend-to-friend basis. And all of a sudden _ `Oh, your tongue in
my mouth is kind of strange!'''
</P>
<P>
   The group dynamic between the four is so strong that Jackson
indicates their closeness to Williamson by calling him ``the fifth
Beatle.''
</P>
<P>
   Although all four actors had done film work previously,
``Dawson's Creek'' has put them on a very fast track to stardom.
Just ask Jackson, whose resume includes more than a dozen movies,
including all three ``Mighty Ducks'' films and the recent ``Apt
Pupil'' (1998).
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my college experience,'' he says. ``If I was in a dorm
right now, I figure it would be the same thing _ except I might be
having to study courses I didn't like.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has been in films such as ``A Thousand Acres'' (1998)
and ``Halloween: H2O,'' but she isn't comfortable yet with the
public attention, and frets about being a role model for young fans
of the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only 18, and I'm still making mistakes and still
learning,'' she says. ``So to be put into that position _ it's kind
of precarious, because my choices aren't necessarily right for
everyone else out there.''
</P>
<P>
   It helps that the glare of the Hollywood spotlight is several
thousand miles away. The show is shot in quaint Wilmington, N.C., a
small town with cobblestone streets that seems still alive with the
spirits of proper Southern belles.
</P>
<P>
   The setting helps Van Der Beek get in touch with his character.
Like Dawson, he grew up in a small town _ Cheshire, Conn., where he
reports that he was anything but a teen sensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've often wondered why so many girls are attracted to
Dawson,'' he says, ``because I was that big of a dork in high
school, and nobody had a crush on me.''
</P>
<P>
   His background includes a smattering of theater work and one
film _ ``Angus'' (1995) _ but it wasn't until he was called in to
audition for ``Dawson's Creek'' that his career really took off.
Currently starring in the feature film ``Varsity Blues,'' he admits
that his life will probably never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as meeting people now, it's different, it's an
adjustment,'' he says with Dawson-esque pensiveness. ``It's not
necessarily a bad thing, it's just a matter of getting comfortable
with the social role of being someone of whom an autograph is
requested. Frequently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of strange,'' he says. ``You haven't changed at all,
it's that everyone around you treats you differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the changes, however, Van Der Beek says he has no
trouble tapping into the angst that fills Dawson's world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone remembers those miserable school dances where
you're just walking around trying to look like you had somebody to
be with,'' he says. ``Memories like that _ getting a tray in the
cafeteria and having no one to sit with _ I'm sure you remember the
first girlfriend who dumped you, the one who broke your heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are things that stay with you, no matter what you've
experienced or how much you've grown.''

 Includes a color slide of country singer Willie Nelson. 
 By J. POET  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Willie Nelson's tour bus sits in the parking lot of a Washington
motel. The rest of his band is checking in and getting ready for
the coming evening's gig, but Nelson is hard at work.
 &HT;    He's been on the telephone all morning, doing interviews to
promote his new album, ``Theatro'' (1998), watching television and
sorting through paperwork for Farm Aid, the organization he started
to help save American family farms. The 65-year-old singer may be
tired, but he changes gears from one subject to the next without
apparent hesitation.
 &HT;    ``One of the rules of the road is flexibility,'' Nelson says in
his familiar Texas drawl. ``If the map says it's 300 miles to the
next gig, it's usually 400. If you think the show is at 8, you'll
go on at 9:30, so you learn to be patient and flexible.''
 &HT;    Nelson has hit the nation's capital to perform in a benefit for
the Campaign for a Landmine Free World. One of the late Princess
Diana's favorite causes, the anti-landmine campaign came to
Nelson's attention through the efforts of fellow country star
Emmylou Harris.
 &HT;    ``Emmylou told me about it while we were working on `Theatro'
with (producer) Daniel Lanois,'' Nelson says. ``Today they are
mainly blowing up children, and we're one of the few countries that
hasn't signed the treaty to ban them.''
 &HT;    Nelson's association with the anti-landmine crusade may be new,
but through the years he's been tireless in his support of good
causes, including his own Farm Aid, an organization that helps
family farms fight the forces that are driving them toward
extinction.
 &HT;    ``I grew up on a farm,'' Nelson says. ``My parents divorced when
I was 6 months old, and they left me with my grandparents, who had
a small farm in Texas. I worked the fields and raised hogs and
calves for FFA (Future Farmers of America) shows, and learned
patience from watching the seasons turn and the crops grow. It's a
hard life, but it was satisfying.
 &HT;    ``Farm Aid grew out of a remark Bob Dylan made during the Live
Aid concert,'' the singer recalls, ``something about farmers in
this country going to bed hungry, just like they're doing in the
rest of the world. Since I'd grown up on a farm, I started to
investigate the issue, and I was shocked by what I found out.
 &HT;    ``Between 1980 and 1983, 2 million farmers lost their land,''
Nelson says, his tone hardening, ``and since 1983 we've been losing
family farms at the rate of 500 a week. Agribusiness doesn't seize
the land outright, but the price controls they lobby for take just
enough money away from the farmer to make it impossible to meet
payments. With the exception of what they did to the Indians, it's
the biggest land grab in American history.
 &HT;    ``That's why I started Farm Aid, to help folks fight back,'' he
says, ``and every cent we make goes to the farmers.''
 &HT;    Nelson's musical career also owes much to his days on the farm.
Both grandparents played music, and Nelson learned to play the
guitar by watching other farm hands during the informal picking
sessions that marked the end of each day.
 &HT;    ``When I was growing up,'' he recalls, ``country music was like
folk music. It was all around you _ it was simple and full of
feeling.''
 &HT;    After a hitch in the Air Force, Nelson drifted from job to job,
eventually landing a position as a disk jockey on a country station
in San Antonio, Texas. It was then that he began writing his own
tunes.
 &HT;    ``I'm a lazy writer,'' he says with a laugh, ``and I usually
wait until a lyric or a title comes along and let the song write
itself. If somebody asks me to write about a specific idea or
feeling I can usually do it, but for myself I tend to wait until it
happens on its own.''
 &HT;    In the early 1960s Nelson moved to Nashville, where country star
Ray Price gave him a gig with his band and signed him to his
publishing company. When Nelson placed ``Crazy'' with Patsy Cline,
his songwriting career took off and with it his own performance
career, although the confessional style of Nelson's lyrics often
put off the Nashville movers and shakers.
 &HT;    ``Country music used to be about strong feelings,'' Nelson says.
``When it became big business they sent it to a 12-step program,
and when it came back it was squeaky clean, like a loaf of white
bread in a plastic bag. It makes some people a lot of money, but
what's the point?''
 &HT;    Nelson eventually left Nashville and went back to Texas, to play
for folks ``in beer joints'' who still loved real country music.
 &HT;    Then RCA released ``The Outlaws,'' a compilation of hits by
Nelson, Waylon Jennings and Tompall Glaser, and pitched it to the
rock-'n'-roll generation. It went gold and established Nelson's
commercial viability, leading to a series of gold albums for
Columbia, starting with ``Red Headed Stranger'' in 1975.
 &HT;    ``CBS said I could do whatever I wanted,'' the singer recalls,
``but they were unhappy with `Red Headed Stranger' when I brought
it to them. The fact that it went platinum made them easier to deal
with, but I had the same battle every time I turned in a record.''
 &HT;    For the next decade Nelson accumulated Grammy Awards and gold
records while living a notoriously hedonistic lifestyle, including
a well-publicized incident in which he smoked pot on the roof of
the Carter White House.
 &HT;    But as country music went mainstream, Nelson's soft-spoken brand
of honky-tonk music went out of style. Columbia dropped him, and in
1991 the Internal Revenue Service hit him with a huge bill for
delinquent taxes.
 &HT;    ``I had no record deal and owed a bunch of money,'' he says,
``but I've always taken things one day at a time, so I got through
it. I've never followed trends. I just play what I play, and
luckily the crowds continue to grow, and I keep getting better as a
musician. I've got more fame than I do money, which probably
helps.''
 &HT;    It was that fame which led to his current recording deal with
Island Records. When Island president Chris Blackwell heard that
Nelson didn't have a contract, he offered him one _ and included a
promise of complete artistic control.
 &HT;    ``I think `Theatro' is one of the best things I've ever done,''
Nelson says. ``I played the songs live with my band _ some old
favorites, some new material _ then let Lanois work his magic with
those space-age rhythms of his.
 &HT;    ``My instinct is to follow the melody and pay attention to the
phrasing and the feeling of the lyric,'' Nelson adds. ``But the
most important thing is the melody _ it's what attracts you to a
song in the first place. You don't want to get too fancy with the
arrangements.
 &HT;    ``If you have a good song and a good singer, you can't go
wrong.''

 Includes a color slide of Laura Dern in a scene from ``October
Sky.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's a safe bet that no Oscar nominee ever made a screen debut
at an earlier age than Laura Dern.
 &HT;    Yes, that's Liza Minnelli as an infant in Judy Garland's arms at
the end of ``The Harvey Girls'' (1946), but check out ``Rebel
Rousers'' (1970).
 &HT;    That otherwise-undistinguished biker movie, filmed in 1967,
stars Bruce Dern, Jack Nicholson and Dern's then-wife, Diane Ladd,
as a visibly pregnant woman. Yes, she was really pregnant _ and,
yes, that baby grew up to be Laura Dern, future Oscar nominee.
 &HT;    ``I waited until the day the film wrapped until I gave my mother
her first contraction,'' Dern says, laughing. ``You see, I didn't
want to start a career off with people thinking I was difficult.''
 &HT;    The only difficult thing about Dern these days is finding her.
She's on television, she's in the movies and, these days, she's in
bridal shops.
 &HT;    No, she isn't about to marry boyfriend Billy Bob Thornton.
 &HT;    ``It's my mother who is getting married on Valentine's Day,''
she explains, ``and I'm standing up as her maid of honor. It's such
a cool thing to calm your mother's wedding jitters.''
 &HT;    If you haven't been invited, you'll have to settle for seeing
Dern in Showtime's recent, critically acclaimed telemovie ``The
Baby Dance,'' or on the big screen on Feb. 18 with ``October Sky,''
a story about young boys in a coal-mining town who dream of
creating their own rockets.
 &HT;    Dern also recently wrapped the southern comedy ``Daddy and
Them,'' due out this fall, written and directed by Thornton. Kelly
Preston, Jim Varney, Andy Griffith and Dern's mother, Diane Ladd,
co-star.
 &HT;    Fresh from that positive experience, Dern _ sipping tea in a
suite at Los Angeles' Park Hyatt Hotel, tall and wispy-thin in a
gray suit, with miles of glossy-blond hair falling softly to her
shoulders _ is even willing to talk about her previously hush-hush
relationship with Thornton, the Oscar-winning writer/director/star
of ``Sling Blade'' (1997).
 &HT;    ``Billy Bob and I were friends for a long time, which I think is
a great way to get to know someone,'' she says. ``You can only be
close to another person if there is that solid friendship backing
it all up.''
 &HT;    The two met on the set of the famous ``Ellen'' coming-out
episode in 1997. Dern had recently ended a long relationship with
actor Jeff Goldblum.
 &HT;    ``We started out talking to each other about changes in our
lives,'' Dern recalls. ``Meeting Billy Bob really was perfect,
because we sympathized with what the other person was going
through. I think to meet on that level was a great gift.''
 &HT;    ``October Sky,'' set in 1950s West Virginia and based on the
true story of rocket scientist Homer Hickam, casts Dern as the
boys' idealistic, inspirational science teacher, Miss Riley.
 &HT;    ``I loved that these boys followed what their hearts wanted them
to do,'' Dern says. ``The film is an example that an extraordinary
teacher can make all of the difference. Homer needed Miss Riley to
tell him to listen to his own voice and believe in himself.
 &HT;    ``I think this film shows how desperately you as a parent want
to protect your own child,'' the actress adds. ``Parents often
think they're doing the right thing, but it turns out to be
limiting. You can do damage to your child because of your own
fears. You need to sometimes put those fears aside and tell your
child, `You can do anything.'''
 &HT;    That's the voice of experience talking.
 &HT;    ``When it came to acting, both of my parents said, `Don't do
it,''' she admits. ``They told me not to act, because acting
doesn't feel good a lot of the time. The funny thing is that they
were always very supportive in terms of my acting work after I
started.''
 &HT;    Dern grew up on film sets with her father and mother, who split
when she was a little girl. Cameos in a couple of her mother's
movies, most notably ``Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore'' (1974),
only whetted her appetite.
 &HT;    At 9, Dern formally announced to her parents that she wanted to
follow in their footsteps.
 &HT;    ``My dad didn't have a strong opinion about it one way or the
other, but my mother was against it,'' the actress recalls. ``My
mother was scared for me because she's a woman _ she had very
specific fears about me getting caught up in looks and age and
being rejected because of physicality and not working. She worried
I would have a great success and then not work.
 &HT;    ``I could understand her point of view,'' Dern says, ``because I
lived with my mom, and I saw on a day-to-day basis what this
business does to a woman. My mother wouldn't consciously let me see
her upset about not getting a role, but I think every child can
sense when a parent is upset. I would feel badly for her when
someone else got a part she wanted so much.''
 &HT;    Ultimately, the 9-year-old made a deal with her mother.
 &HT;    ``Mom said, `OK, study for a few years and, if you're still into
it, then you can get an agent,''' she recalls. ``The fact that I
studied for two years and spent every weekend in acting class
scared her. I didn't say, `Oh, I want to play with my friends and
blow this off.'''
 &HT;    At 11, Dern got her reward.
 &HT;    ``I met an agent through a friend, and my mother allowed me to
go on an audition,'' the actress recalls. ``I got my first movie
role in `Foxes.' And my mother was devastated _ I remember her
crying, `Now you're going to think it's so easy.'''
 &HT;    Bruce Dern says there was no going back after his daughter
starred with Jodie Foster in ``Foxes'' (1980).
 &HT;    ``She was a natural,'' he says in a separate interview. ``People
ask all the time if I gave her advice or helped her with the roles
because she was so young. I didn't really have to teach Laura a
lot. It was very evident at about 11 years old that Laura got it.
 &HT;    ``It's a magical light bulb that went off inside of her, which
doesn't happen very often to anybody,'' he recalls. ``When I saw my
daughter had this talent, it was a very emotional moment for me. I
saw her get into character, and I was so moved. I thought, `She
understands it, she feels it.'''
 &HT;    That gift led to the critically praised ``Smooth Talk'' (1985).
She followed that with two films for director David Lynch, ``Blue
Velvet'' (1986) and ``Wild At Heart'' (1990), winner of the Palme
d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. In 1991, she earned a
best-actress Oscar nomination as a likably sluttish Southern girl
in ``Rambling Rose.'' Her other credits include ``Teachers''
(1984), ``Mask'' (1985), ``Haunted Summer'' (1988), ``Fat Man and
Little Boy'' (1989), ``A Perfect World'' (1993) and the blockbuster
``Jurassic Park'' (1993).
 &HT;    ``I don't want to sound like some revolting stereotype of an
actor,'' Dern says, ``but I really think a character has a life of
her own. If you're lucky, you bring a character to a scene in a way
where you never quite know what her response will be like or what
will come up, despite the fact that there is a script. There are
things that I do where I surprise myself.''
 &HT;    And her audience, too, especially the younger ones who know her
from ``Jurassic Park.''
 &HT;    ``To kids, I'm the lady who stuck her hands in dinosaur poop,''
she says, laughing. ``I always have kids looking at me wide-eyed in
airports and asking, `Was it real dino poop?' I get that all over
the world.
 &HT;    ``Of course I tell them, `Yes, it was real,''' she adds. ``Why
shatter the illusions?''

AHEAD TO THE PAST: JORDANA BREWSTER TAKES ON `THE '60S' 
</HEADLINE>

 Includes a color slide of Jordana Brewster in a scene from ``The
'60s.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Going to Yale in the 1960s must have been an amazing experience.
But what if you had to choose between the two _ Yale or the 1960s?
 &HT;    That was Jordana Brewster's dilemma.
 &HT;    The 18-year-old actress, best known for her three-year stint on
the soap opera ``As the World Turns,'' chose to defer her freshman
year at Yale to play hippie in ``The '60s,'' a four-hour-long
miniseries that will air Feb. 7 and 8 on NBC.
 &HT;    ``I was all packed and ready to go,'' the effusive actress says
by telephone from her parents' home in Manhattan. ``But when I got
the role, I just had to do it.''
 &HT;    The role was Sarah Weinstock, one of several characters whose
experiences from 1960 to 1969 are woven into ``The '60s.''
 &HT;    ``Sarah goes from being a Barnard College girl who's a bit
conservative to a girl who gets involved in the peace movement,''
Brewster says. ``Her parents want her to express her ideas and be
idealistic, but they don't necessarily want her to act on them.
They want her to be comfortable, get married and have children.
 &HT;    ``That's what women were supposed to do, which is sick.''
 &HT;    Rounding out the cast are Jeremy Sisto as an emerging radical,
Josh Hamilton as a pacifist, Julia Stiles as a pregnant hippie,
Jerry O'Connell as a shellshocked Vietnam vet and Charles Dutton
and Leonard Roberts as members of a black family who become
embroiled in the civil-rights movement.
 &HT;    Brewster, who lives in Los Angeles, was born in 1980 and has no
firsthand knowledge of the 1960s _ though she does have a family
connection to the era: Her grandfather, Kingman Brewster, was the
controversial president of Yale for most of the decade.
 &HT;    ``Kids now attach cliches to the '60s,'' the actress says. ``We
think of free love, flower power, being a hippie, smoking a lot of
pot and not having to worry about the consequences of our actions.
 &HT;    ``People also tend to generalize the era and assume it was only
about one movement or that everybody was a hippie,'' she adds.
``What's good about the miniseries is that every character has a
different point of view, and that lets you see the diversity of the
'60s, the different mentalities people had.
 &HT;    ``I read a lot of books and tried to get familiar with the
movements, with the war,'' Brewster says. ``None of that was as
helpful as tapping into the mentality and emotions that were going
on, and I did that through music, by listening to Bob Dylan
incessantly.''
 &HT;    During the production, Brewster sported bell bottoms, go-go
boots and love beads, and participated in the re-creation of the
student takeover at Columbia University. She visited the set during
the recreation of the Woodstock concert, and met Carnie Wilson,
daughter of Beach Boy leader Brian Wilson, who plays Mama Earth, a
woman who runs a commune.
 &HT;    The scope of the production daunted Brewster, she confesses.
 &HT;    ``To be honest, I was very scared and tentative the first couple
of weeks,'' she says. ``It's a huge thing to do justice to, the
'60s.
 &HT;    ``We were told that we were bringing the story of the '60s to my
generation,'' the 18-year-old says, ``and I had people in their 40s
and 50s telling me I couldn't possibly understand what was going
on. That made it even scarier.
 &HT;    ``I finally had to remember that I'm acting,'' she adds. ``And
by feeling the character's emotions, as draining as it was, I think
I understood the character and a little of the bigger picture.''
 &HT;    Brewster arrived at ``The '60s'' fresh from Robert Rodriguez's
``The Faculty'' (1999), a box-office disappointment that cast her
as a high-school cheerleader who joins several other students to
save her school _ and mankind itself _ from aliens who have taken
over the bodies of the faculty.
 &HT;    ``Talk about a completely different experience,'' she says
breathlessly. ``I liked one particular review, which said, `In the
midst of all these pretentious movies, here's a fun one.'
 &HT;    ``That was my first feature,'' the actress says. ``To work with
Robert Rodriguez off the bat was amazing and, like on `The '60s,' I
was intimidated. I was shaking the first couple of days.
 &HT;    ``I was still 17 when I did the movie,'' she adds, ``so these
situations are very abnormal compared to what a typical kid goes
through. I felt like I was in high school, because we were all
thrown together and had to hang out.''
 &HT;    Brewster particularly appreciated the chance to work
occasionally with the established actors who played the possessed
faculty members, especially Robert Patrick and Famke Janssen.
 &HT;    ``I liked the movie a lot,'' Brewster says, ``and thought the
chemistry between all of us was very cool. I didn't see the adults
work very much, so it was a surprise to see what Robert and Famke
did.''
 &HT;    The daughter of a former model and a banker, Brewster was born
in Panama and raised in London, Brazil and Manhattan. She caught
the acting bug as a girl, and spent her early teens splitting time
between high school and the soap opera ``As the World Turns,'' on
which she played Nikki Munson.
 &HT;    Actresses who have moved on to the big screen tend to knock the
soaps, but Brewster recalls the experience as an invaluable working
education.
 &HT;    ``It depends on the soap you're on,'' she says. ``Some of them
want ratings, so you have to have your shirt off constantly and
it's all about melodrama.
 &HT;    ``I was on `As the World Turns,' which has been on for 40 years
and is pretty realistic. I got to learn from some wonderful actors.
 &HT;    ``On a soap, because your performance is on for one day, you're
allowed to explore and allowed to make mistakes,'' Brewster says.
``You don't get that chance with movies, where people see it over
and over and all of your mistakes are magnified because you're on a
big screen.
 &HT;    ``I got a chance to explore and also to develop a sense of
professionalism,'' she says. ``I couldn't go out and party with my
friends if I had to be on the set at 7 in the morning with 20 pages
of dialogue memorized.''
 &HT;    Having finally gotten her break and been cast in two
high-profile projects, Brewster now plans to turn her attention to
Yale. She'll begin classes in fall 1999, and hopes to emulate Yale
grad Jodie Foster by acting during summer breaks.
 &HT;    It's a calculated risk for a recent Seventeen Magazine cover
girl who is only now generating buzz. Today's Hollywood hot ticket
can be tomorrow's yesterday's news.
 &HT;    ``You can be huge at one point and then, in five years, be
nowhere,'' Brewster admits. ``That scares me to death, so I'm
trying to be smart.
 &HT;    ``I want to play different characters,'' she says. ``I never
want to act solely for money or fame. I plan to study literature,
and I think I can only help my acting by learning about characters,
by comparing a character's inner monologue to his or her actions.
 &HT;    ``I think the life experience I'll acquire at Yale will only
help, too,'' she adds. ``I'll be hanging out with kids my age and
be secluded in New Haven.''
 &HT;    All of which reinforces Brewster in the gamble she's taking.
 &HT;    ``Heat is heat, and it's transient,'' she says. ``I want to act
until I die, but I'm not kidding myself. I'm 18 _ I realize that my
career is not really in my control, and I hate that aspect of the
business.
 &HT;    ``Going to school is the one thing I can control,'' she
concludes. ``Hopefully I'll grow and learn as a person, and get
better as an actress.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Trent Tries the 12-step Cure
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENT: Hello. My name is Trent and . . .
</P>
<P>
   GROUP: Hi, Trent.
</P>
<P>
   TRENT: . . . and I'm an impeachaholic.
</P>
<P>
   GROUP: Ahhhhh.
</P>
<P>
   TRENT: I suppose my story's old hat to you, but it is painful
for me to tell anyway.
</P>
<P>
   GROUP: Go on. We understand.
</P>
<P>
   TRENT: It started when I saw those other Republicans, the ones
over in the House, whooping it up for impeachment. Sure, they were
a bit out of hand, some of them, and a lot you could say were even
over the top. But it looked like fun, too, and I thought . . . I
thought . . .
</P>
<P>
   GROUP: It's OK. Go ahead.
</P>
<P>
   TRENT: I thought, when the party came over to the Senate, that I
could have just a little impeachment and let the rest go. You know,
just a few days of it. Just a little social impeaching.
</P>
<P>
   GROUP: Oh oh.
</P>
<P>
   TRENT: I figured, well, what harm can a few lawyers' arguments
do? Judges hear them all the time and don't get hooked. So, sure,
maybe you get a little bit high _ all that 90-proof talk about the
president being just about the worst crook since Charles Manson, or
maybe O.J. since he and O.J. are so much alike, what with the women
and all and Clinton lying all the time about everything to
everybody and HAVING HIS WAY WITH THE RULE OF LAW AND...
</P>
<P>
   GROUP: Whoa. Slow down. Take a deep breath, Trent.
</P>
<P>
   TRENT: Sorry, but you get the idea. That stuff can go right to
your head. And those boys who showed up from the House, they're a
hard-partying crowd. You try to cut them off or even say you've had
about enough impeachment yourself, and the next thing you know
you're back in the bar with them. They say, ``Hey, let's have a
round of witnesses'' and you say ``How many?'' and they say
``Fifteen'' and you say ``I just want to go home'' and they say
``But you can't. Be polite. You can't disrespect us, so tell you
what: let's just have three witnesses _ for the road, you know?
Sort of a nightcap.''
</P>
<P>
   (His voice trails off.)
</P>
<P>
   GROUP: Take your time.
</P>
<P>
   TRENT: I knew I was in trouble. Old friends started staying away
from me. I could lose my job. So I made a firm deadline for
quitting.
</P>
<P>
   GROUP: (applause)
</P>
<P>
   TRENT: I said to myself, no more impeachment. Hey, I'm a grown
man. I can handle this stuff and I know when enough is enough. But,
darn those House fellows. They say ``What could be wrong with just
a couple of weeks more?'' And, really, what could be? So Henry Hyde
throws his arm around me and says, ``C'mon, some videotaping _ you
never know what you might see, if you get my drift _ have you seen
'JenniCam' on the web? Doesn't that sound like fun?'' And I say
``Well . . .'' and Henry says, ``You don't want make Bob Barr mad,
do you? You never can tell what he might do when he's like this.''
So I say, ``OK, but if we don't quit impeaching by, I say February
12, I don't know what I'll do,'' and Henry says, ``Loosen up,
Trent. All we have to do is vote for another week of impeaching if
we want to. Or another month.''
</P>
<P>
   So what do you folks, think? Do you think I should . . . Hey,
where did everybody go?

 &HT;    Born with a mission to make great music
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Music is love,'' Robert Shaw told us. And Atlanta
believed him.
</P>
<P>
   The city that almost fired Shaw in 1972 nevertheless had a love
affair with him over decades _ not just Shaw the musician but Shaw
the man. The Atlanta Symphony director emeritus who died last week
was loved for his earthy ``cracker barrel'' laugh as well as the
spirituality of his music.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta lawyer Robert Edge was one of those who led the revolt
against the symphony executive committee who wanted to fire Shaw in
the 1970s. ``They thought he was too `avant garde' for a
traditional Southern city,'' he said, ``It still gives me cold
chills that we almost lost him.''
</P>
<P>
   Edge and Shaw were close personal friends, but Edge never got
over his awe of Shaw's passion and intellect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he was given a special mission in life,'' he said,
``and you could sense it _ there were no holds barred when Robert
delivered the music the composer wanted to convey.'' Edge, who
serves on the Board of the Metropolitan Opera in New York, believes
Shaw was the nation's most provocative spokesman for the arts,
gifted with words as few musicians are. ``He believed there was a
time in the history of man when the church was a great human force
_ and that today, the arts play that role.''
</P>
<P>
   Edge paused _ ``just meditating,'' he said sadly as he collected
his feelings about his friend's death. When the news came, Edge had
been preparing to teach a church class on ``Samson and Delilah,''
the Saint-Saens work based on the Old Testament that the Atlanta
Opera will perform this season. Words about Samson in the opera's
first Act seemed perfect when applied to Shaw: ``(Ah!) the breath
of God has passed through his soul.''
</P>
<P>
   But Shaw's views on the relationship of worship and the arts
were complex, says Lois Reitzes, program director at WABE (public
radio), who knew Shaw well from a dozen years of interviews and
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a minister, Shaw was a vocal critic of televangelism,
which he once called, ``the crystal Christ-o-ramas, the Sunday
Spectaculars of bigotry and contempt for men's minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Worship, Shaw said, ``doesn't require you to check your mind at
the door.'' But he was never contemptuous of the people's music _
folk hymns, carols, and spirituals, he found ``tuned and polished
by generations of unintentional composers, nameless amateurs who
loved their God and wanted to praise him.''
</P>
<P>
   In an unpublished lecture Shaw gave at Trinity Presbyterian
Church in 1982, he linked worship and art in a profound way:
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, at least, the arts may provide the day by day
confirmation of a Creator's hand still at work in the lives and
affairs of men.''
</P>
<P>
   When Reitzes heard Shaw had died while attending a play at Yale
that his son Tom was directing, she recalled a story Shaw had
shared with her. The maestro had just returned from a stay at the
family get-away in rural France. And he told Reitzes proudly that
then-14-year-old Tommy had ``birthed a sheep'' while they were
there. ``We read and sing about sheep,'' he said, ``but, really,
how many 14-year-olds qualify to be shepherds?''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Shaw was a modern shepherd. He led us through the
valleys of requiems, the whole littered landscape of serious sound,
so we might not fear spiritual heights. And like a shepherd, his
first concern was for those in his care, his musicians, his
audience, his Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   I'll never forget his words on receiving a prestigious cultural
award from the French government. ``Music,'' he said ``is not
conductable. It is singable and playable.''
</P>
<P>
   Then raising his own hands which had shaped the finest chorale
music in this country, he insisted with a shepherd's humility,
``These hands make no sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Until his death Monday, he was wrong.

 &HT;    We Americans are growing bigger, but not for the better
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ By and large, we are getting larger.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 20th century, Americans have been getting taller
and heavier. With better prenatal care, fewer childhood diseases
and much _ much _ more food, we have been pushing our bodies to new
heights and widths.
</P>
<P>
   But will this trend continue in the next century? Are we on our
way to becoming a land of 7-foot giants?
</P>
<P>
   The answer depends on many factors, including genetics, diet
changes, cultural attitudes and medical breakthroughs. We could end
up being bigger, or perhaps thinner. If we start getting smaller,
it wouldn't be the first time that happened.
</P>
<P>
   Anthropologists say men who lived about 10,000 years ago often
grew to be 6-footers. In the days when we hunted and gathered our
food, we were big, robust people who stood about as tall as today's
Americans. We started shrinking when we began farming and settling
into cities.
</P>
<P>
   That may seem surprising because we assume farming created more
food for prehistoric people. It did, but having more food in a
permanent settlement encouraged us to have more babies. As
populations rose, we each got less food and more disease. Primitive
agriculture was good enough to boost birth rates, but not good
enough to produce strapping young adults, so human beings began to
shrink.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two centuries, that trend reversed dramatically as
farming methods improved. U.S. Army records, which go back to
colonial times, give us a good measure of growth: On the eve of the
Civil War, Americans were the world's tallest people, with men
averaging 5 feet, 6 inches. By World War I, Army recruits were up
to 5 feet, 7 inches. In World War II, our soldiers stood about 5
feet, 8 inches. Today, they average 5 feet, 10 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Although Americans are tall, we no longer are the tallest people
in the world. Today's big folks are found in the Netherlands and in
Scandinavian countries where everyone has access to good health
care. Millions of Americans fail to reach their maximum height
potential because their mothers don't get prenatal care. And many
U.S. babies get little medical care.
</P>
<P>
   But once we make it past the earliest stages of life, we get
plenty of food. Double cheeseburgers, sweet treats and
calorie-loaded beverages are making us much heavier.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that among
adults studied between 1988 and 1994, about 35 percent were
overweight. That was a 9 percent jump from adults studied from 1976
to 1980. Nutritionists say the weight gains among children are
especially alarming; about 25 percent of kids now weigh too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't gained any height in the past 25 years, but we have
gained a lot of weight,'' said Richard Steckel, a professor of
anthropology at Ohio State University. ``We're taking in too many
calories ... and not getting enough exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   So what will happen in the next century? With technology taking
over ever more tasks, our lifestyles could become even less
strenuous. Our best hope for reversing that trend may be to get
both schools and employers to promote exercise during lunch hours.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is that drug companies may develop a pill to
stop the body from absorbing calories from fatty foods. In fact,
one company, Hoffmann-La Roche, already is seeking Food and Drug
Administration approval for just such a drug, called Orlistat.
</P>
<P>
   But if we can develop pills to help slim our bodies, can we find
other drugs to make ourselves taller? Steckel said that although
some companies may try to develop such pills, it would be unwise to
do so because ``we're already pretty close to our optimal size,''
he said. After men reach a height of about 6 feet, 1 inch, they
actually start to become less healthy. Extremely tall people often
have heart problems and die at younger ages, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So over the next century, we may pick up a couple of inches in
height, but we will not turn into giants. As for our waists, Gerald
Berenson, a heart and weight expert at Tulane University, believes
we will start to find the will power to change simply because the
health consequences of obesity are becoming so clear. ``We're going
to have to plateau off because we just can't keep ballooning like
this,'' he said.

 &HT;    Socks ready to kick up his heels
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ When the Clintons first moved into the White
House, I paid particular attention to stories about Socks and how
he was adjusting to his new home. I worried he might get stuck in
an elevator or maybe slip out the front door and be trampled by a
crowd of demonstrators on Pennsylvania Avenue. Most of all, I
wondered where they were going to put the sandbox.
</P>
<P>
   As far back as memory serves, there have been cats in my life.
There was always a ``Putsy'' or a ``Jackie'' in the house, and once
there was a ``Booger'' (named for his disgusting habit of doing his
business in the piano).
</P>
<P>
   The cat-loving genes were inherited from my mother's side of the
family. Grandmother Parker never had fewer than 15 or 20, and they
all lived in. Each had an individual personality that was catered
to. Charlie McCarthy, a giant white tomcat insisted his meals be
served on the upstairs screen porch. Tommy preferred his sandbox in
the butler's pantry. Baby liked coffee with heavy cream.
</P>
<P>
   Granddaddy Parker often compared his family's food and vet bills
to those of the Clyde Beatty circus, but no stray was ever turned
away. When the '29 crash came along, the same courtesy was extended
to vagrants. As a kid, a visit to grandmother's always meant a new
face to talk to over a plate of food on the back porch.
</P>
<P>
   First cat Socks has had more media coverage than the average
housecat and for obvious reasons: (SET ITAL)His(END ITAL) house is
the big White one inside the Beltway. For a while, Socks' home life
seemed idyllic. He napped in sunny patches on the Oval Office
carpet, and went for rides on his president's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Socks has always taken his Top Cat position seriously as
evidenced in his official White House portrait. In spite of the
silly bow tie someone hung around his neck, Socks' feline dignity
and nobility manage to shine through.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Buddy, the chocolate Lab. Immediately, the news shifts to
the mundane: Buddy is being housebroken; Buddy is learning tricks.
Socks turns up his nose. What's the big deal? he wonders. How tough
could it be learning not to have accidents on the carpet? And as
for rolling over and playing dead - forget it. Cats don't do
tricks. From time to time, they may indulge in amusing antics, but
certainly never on command.
</P>
<P>
   People do not train cats, no matter what they claim. What passes
for training to us is little more than a cat's desire to indulge a
human. Truth is, our cats train us. Mine have done a hell of a job.
</P>
<P>
   Each morning, I am awakened by a ladylike mew from Little Sister
Stella. A gentle paw on the cheek will usually do it, but if it
doesn't, she shifts to plan 2 where she grabs a mouthful of my hair
and pulls. Folks are usually fooled by her small stature and
dignified demeanor, but make no mistake, she rules with an iron paw
_ albeit one concaled in a furry white glove. Stella and
</P>
<P>
   Biddy have trained me to keep fresh butter in their licking dish
and to buy only vanilla ice cream. And on the rare occasion when I
fall short of their expectations, I am duly punished. Cats do not
suffer fools gladly.
</P>
<P>
   Before anyone sets pen to paper to give me what for, let me
assure you I love dogs. Once I even had a puppy. Two weeks into her
potty training, a neighbor told me that no matter how I coaxed, the
pup would not use the sandbox. Said I'd have to take her outside to
pee. Made sense to me - the inside was all used up anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back at the White House, Buddy is dazzling folks with
his good humor (I'm told he was smiling as he bit the hand of the
Marine helicopter pilot who was playing ball with him) and his
willingness to obey commands as he wags his way through the
remaining months of his master's term.
</P>
<P>
   And as for Socks? The first cat has decided he's seen it all and
is looking forward to retirement.

 &HT;    Continuing daytime medical drama of parent who overdoes it
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ I coached Little League 10 years ago. I have yet
to regain my voice.
</P>
<P>
   I can speak, but what once was resonant became an intercom rasp
most commonly associated with ``Would you like fries with that?''
</P>
<P>
   Recently I agreed to coach my son's basketball team. Quickly my
voice went from bad to barely audible. Add a bout of the Central
Texas crud, the super germ known to spend the winter in area
sinuses. I've had more than one person come up lately, thump my
larynx with a middle finger and ask, ``Is this thing on?''
</P>
<P>
   So I went to a specialist, Dr. Cleophes D. Tunnel. He examined
me at his Carpal Diem Center for Repetitive Stress Ailments.
</P>
<P>
   I told him my problem. Actually, I couldn't talk, so I sketched
it for him on scratch pad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh hum. Yes. Yes, indeed. And the doggie did what on that
lollipop tree?''
</P>
<P>
   Flustered, I had to gesture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voice. Gone,'' I rasped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh hum. Tell me your family history,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I sighed deeply and set about to sketch my life story _ Mom,
Dad, the covered wagon, everything. After 45 minutes of frantic
diagramming, the pencil dropped from my limp, exhausted hand. Dr.
Tunnel stroked his chin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes. Uh hum,'' he said, peering over my heiroglyphs. ``Yes,
indeed. Quite clearly. A case of chronic accute PTBVBD.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Which is..?'' I rasped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Post-T-Ball Voice-Box Disorder. We see it in coaches and
parental spectators. Very common.''
</P>
<P>
   This provided little solace. Long ago I figured I shot my wad,
locution-wise, with all those hours of shouting ``Get it to the
pitcher'' to 6- and 7-year-olds who were chasing a little white
ball like a pack of blind harp seals. I was, however, interested to
find out it had a clinical name.
</P>
<P>
   Since I had the doctor there, I inquired about some other
lingering injuries I suspected might have been caused by repetitive
motions as a parent.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote out, ``shoulder pain.'' He asked me to sketch out common
family activities, which I did.
</P>
<P>
   I told him about following our kids around and videoing their
every action for posterity. In particular, I sketched out the
plight of recording PTA musical programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh hum. Yes. That's it. You suffer from carpal camcorder
condition. Very common among modern parents _ 63 percent of my
patient load, in fact.''
</P>
<P>
   When I complained about a stiff neck, and of repetitive trips
jockeying unruly kids kids to school, to the park, to the ends of
the earth, he was quick with a clinical hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carpal carpool condition, unquestionably.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what about this wrist problem?'' I rasped. I've had the
soreness since my boys were small. ``We used to play little games
in the wading pool, over and over,'' I told the doctor. ``You know,
'ashes, ashes, we all fall down.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have diagnosed your own problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which is?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ring-Around-the-Rosie wrist. Some sufferers also have a
collateral condition we call Ring-Around-the-Rosie rump.''
</P>
<P>
   Fascinating as I found this _ the fact that all of my ailments
had clinical definitions _ I began to realize that Dr. Tunnel
hadn't suggested any treatment for the problem that brought me to
him.
</P>
<P>
   Putting aside the wrist problem, and the camcorder shoulder, and
the carpool neck ache, I wrote down a demand: ``Please. Prescribe
something that will save my voice.'''
</P>
<P>
   He took out a pad, scribbled, handed me the scrip, shook my hand
and smiled as he excused himself.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until later, moritified before a chuckling pharmacist,
that I realized what Dr. Tunnel had prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't yell.''

 &HT;    Car trouble? Maybe online expert can help
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Once upon a time, before the age of computers, cars
were the chief source of aggravation in most folks' lives. The act
of keeping them in good repair and figuring out their intricacies
took up great chunks of free time.
</P>
<P>
   Now computers create the same worries. So it is only fair that
today, with the help of the Web, we investigate ways computers and
the Internet can help solve your automotive problems and worries.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say that, for instance, you have a 1991 Ford Taurus that
makes a strange ker-plunka, ker-plunka sound when you attempt to
drive up an incline. You could drive it down to the dealership that
sold it to you (which isn't such a dumb idea), or you could try to
find out a little about the problem in advance (not so dumb
either). That way, even if it isn't something you can fix yourself,
you'll sound a bit more knowledgeable at the garage.
</P>
<P>
   There are several Web sites that offer advice and tips, but the
beauty of the Allexperts.com auto repair page is that you can ask
specific questions. If you go to the page at
http://www.allexperts.com/cars
</P>
<P>
   /repairs.shtml you'll be able to click on the model of car you
own and then send e-mail to an expert. Since this is a free service
and since the experts are all volunteers, it's a good starting
point. And there is a fairly straightforward description of each
expert's qualifications. That way, you'll have a fair idea of how
much faith to put in the advice you get.
</P>
<P>
   The Automobile Troubleshooter at
http://www.diadex.com/expert/auto/index.html isn't as personal as
our first site, but it is free and can be helpful. You start by
selecting the general type of automotive problem _ for instance,
whether the engine will start, or transmission problems.
</P>
<P>
   Then you'll be asked a series of questions. Each question
presumably narrows the list of probable problems. It's not the sort
of information that will offer you a sure-fire answer to your
problem, but it does do a good job of rounding up the logical
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Our next Web site is run by Tom and Ray Magliozzi (a.k.a ``Click
and Clack: The Tappet Brothers''). These are busy brothers. They
have a national radio show and also produce a syndicated column.
The Web site, at http://cartalk.cars.com/, has a lot of features,
including an archive of past columns.
</P>
<P>
   But let's talk about that ker-plunka, ker-plunka sound we
mentioned earlier. A lot of times novices tend to describe car
problems in terms of the noise they make. You may be surprised to
know that _ just as is true with a physician _ sounds are important
to a mechanic, too.
</P>
<P>
   This site offers you the opportunity at
http://cartalk.cars.com/About/Noises/ to actually listen to a
sampling of sound files and try to match them with what you're
hearing from your car. It's a novel approach to remote diagnostics,
and even if it doesn't work, you'll have fun trying.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you'll notice _ if you search the Web for automobile
advice sites _ that many of the places you find are commercial.
You'll pay (usually about $20) for advice by e-mail. Without ruling
on the merits of these sites (to really judge them fairly, you'd
have to submit a series of questions and then compare the results
with what a real-world mechanic would find), we'll just note that
if you are willing to pay for advice, a mechanic locally (even one
not as skilled) has a real advantage over distant experts, since he
or she can actually see and hear the problem.

 &HT;    Apple comeback stems from iMac
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Powered by a little computer that looks like an
iridescent gumdrop, Apple Computer continues to grow stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Its iMac computer was ranked No. 1 or 4, depending on what
survey you believe, in sales among all computers in the final three
months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That's one heck of an accomplishment for a company that had been
all but written off a year ago. Now listen to what top analysts are
saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question (Apple will be) a strong player,'' Stephen
Baker, a research analyst at PC Data, recently told online news
service ZDNet.
</P>
<P>
   In its latest industry survey, PC Data ranked the iMac as the
top seller among PCs in last year's fourth quarter. It said the
iMac accounted for 6.2 percent of volume sales and 7.2 percent of
the dollar amount.
</P>
<P>
   Since its August debut, the iMac has captured 6 percent of all
computer sales, according the PC Data survey. It has stayed among
the top five best-sellers since August. In the fiercely competitive
PC world, in which new models are continually introduced at lower
prices, few stay on top for long.
</P>
<P>
   The same may be happening with the iMac. While No. 1 through the
last three months of 1998, the iMac's position began eroding
sharply in December. It lost its first-place mantle to Compaq's
Presario models.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason Apple has tried jazzing up the iMac,
announcing it will now come in five new iridescent colors.
</P>
<P>
   PC Data's survey ranked the iMac higher than other competing
surveys. ZD Market Intelligence, for example, ranked iMac the
fourth-best-selling PC.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the two surveys is in what was counted.
ZD Market Intelligence counted only sales at retailers, such as
electronic superstores.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, PC Data counted both retail and mail-order sales.
</P>
<P>
   Mail-order sales are significant for the Mac. Mac enthusiasts
tend to be more sophisticated about computers than their PC
counterparts. Many know exactly what they want, shopping strictly
by price.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of prices, it is the one area in which most analysts
believe Apple remains vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Says ZD Market Intelligence analyst Matt Sargent, in an online
interview, ``To improve results in the retail stores, Apple needs
to continue to lower the prices of its systems to compete more
effectively against sub-$1,000 offerings from PC vendors.''

 &HT;    Cable modem a marvel, but not a miracle
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The two little green lights shine unblinking, all
through the night.
</P>
<P>
   And all through the day, too. The connection stays constant,
from desktop to the Internet whether the computer is booted up,
shut down or just plain crashed. But get that computer running,
open your Netscape browser and you are on the Net with the promise
of stunningly fast surfing and blazing downloads.
</P>
<P>
   It's a cable modem.
</P>
<P>
   But is it everything you've wanted? You have to wonder, whether
you use the 'Net for business or entertainment, amusement or
commerce. Because you have heard the talk _ not to mention the
hype. Talk of broadband via cable modem or digital subscriber lines
from a phone company, billion-dollar deals involving Internet or
phone companies aiming to offer fancier content via zippier access.
</P>
<P>
   You have added interest if you have a dial-up service to the
'Net and been angered by frequent busy signals _ not to mention
aggravated by that annoying sound a modem makes dialing in to the
server. Or maybe you've had the connection broken a few times. Most
of all, you have perhaps been frustrated at how long it takes to
download files, to view video clips or graphics.
</P>
<P>
   If that is you, you are looking for a better way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is broadband,'' proclaims MediaOne. ``This is the way.''
So we took a look, hoping to answer _ at least partially _ some of
the questions that would be asked by any potential customer. For
instance: Just how fast is it?
</P>
<P>
   In theory, cable modems are more than 100 times faster than a
standard modem. A cable modem can handle more than 10 million bits
of information per second, vs. 28,800 bits for many modems and
56,000 bits for the fastest dial-up modems.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the number can be a lot lower for any method you
use to connect. MediaOne says you should expect no more than about
1.5 million bits per second from the cable modem, since
transmission speeds are dependent on a number of factors. If you
hit a clogged server or a congested line, it won't matter much that
you have lightning speed on the final leg of the trip, said Tom
Buttermore, MediaOne's director of high-speed data.
</P>
<P>
   Critics _ often folks from the phone companies _ argue that
cable modems are oversold, that cable doesn't have the reliability
of a phone line. Would you lose your 'Net link as often as your
cable television? What happens in a storm? Also, if all your
neighbors were to sign up for cable modems, it could affect the
speed. But cable companies shrug off that criticism, saying they
can install more equipment in the neighborhood to take care of it.
</P>
<P>
   During my most intensive downloading, I haven't seen the average
speed of my cable modem break past 100 kilobytes per second _
roughly 1 million bits of data _ based on the count on the bottom
bar of my browser. Not bad at all, but not radically better than
what I get at work through a T-1 line.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm not going to have a high-speed T-1 line at home, only a
dial-up modem. And the real story isn't the numbers _ it's the
time. If you compare it with ad nauseam waits for downloading, then
the cable modem is definitely a treat. When I downloaded a new
version of Netscape on my 28.8 modem, it took about 52 minutes. A
few months after, the cable modem was installed and I started
thinking about a Netscape upgrade. It took about 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   I peeked at a trailer for the new ``Star Wars'' flick, a preview
file consisting of 969,000 bits of data. It took 2 minutes to
download and made me wish I'd gone to the Jedi academy.
</P>
<P>
   What is installation like?
</P>
<P>
   It isn't like a dial-up modem that you are expected to set up
yourself. And it isn't like a phone line that can be turned on by
the flick of a switch in some central office while you are out.
</P>
<P>
   Three trucks _ count 'em, three _ came to my house. Lines were
strung from the poles in the street, connected to the house and run
inside. A network interface card was popped into the computer and
some software configured.
</P>
<P>
   It took several hours. My presence was required.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I did order the complete package that included phone
service, along with cable television and the cable modem. That
clearly made the process more labor-intensive. (And as for the
MediaOne phone service, that's another story.)
</P>
<P>
   What's it like to use? What if there's trouble?
</P>
<P>
   The basics are a cinch. You are always connected, so you don't
need to either dial-up or wait for the connection. You launch the
browser, sit back a few seconds, and you are there.
</P>
<P>
   If there is trouble, MediaOne runs a technical support unit from
7 a.m. to midnight. The two times I needed them, they were patient
and helpful. I called once when I lost my connections and e-mail
after installing a new operating system on the Mac. The voice on
the other end was friendly, and her first question was about the
little green lights. ``Are they on?'' I assured her they were.
``Cool,'' she said, and walked me through a rewrite of my browser
settings. I was back in business in five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   What can you do with a cable modem that you couldn't do without
it?
</P>
<P>
   That could be the critical question. And the answer is less
dramatic than you'd think _ that is, if time means nothing to you.
After all, a dial-up modem can do the same things. But they do it
an awful lot more slowly than broadband.
</P>
<P>
   Do you want to watch a video clip, a 1.5 million-bit file? On a
standard modem, downloading that takes 6 minutes and change. Even
with a 56k modem, it's still at least 3 minutes. On the cable
modem, it should come in under 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Again, your mileage may vary _ remember that your connection
cannot help with congestion in a server in, say, Chicago. But in
most cases, broadband may not be the only way, but it sure is the
faster way.
</P>
<P>
   And some things that dial-up just can't do. For example, the
cable modem permits you to listen to ``streaming audio'' _ radio or
music _ while doing other work.
</P>
<P>
   The Net as a whole seems to be moving toward speed. Portal sites
are teaming with broadband providers to design content with high
speed in mind. Although analysts say the shift will take years, the
logic seems inexorable: Today's broadband experience will look
shabby compared to what's coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 56k-encoded video looks crummy on a 56k modem, and it looks
crummy on a cable modem, too,'' Buttermore said. ``But you are
starting to see more content for broadband.''
</P>
<P>
   So you just sit down that first day, turn on your Net radio and
start watching video clips?
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. ``Streaming'' data that make up audio and video
require specialized software like RealPlayer or Shockwave. Some
cable companies will set up your computer with that software, known
as plug-ins. MediaOne offers the next best thing, a free and
convenient download of plug-ins from its home page.
</P>
<P>
   But it took me a while to realize that, since the company hadn't
mentioned it during the installation and I was too boneheaded to
investigate the home page. Instead, I floundered around a bit,
searching for the right software and tentatively downloading this
and that. So the service seems not yet pitched for the newbie who
wants to log on and instantly watch video. The assumption seems to
be that anyone getting a cable modem is savvy enough to get the
advantages without hand-holding _ not an accurate assessment in my
case.
</P>
<P>
   If you have never downloaded anything before, or if you expect
instant karma, you might get impatient. And it's not the download
time, but the hassle. But once you go through the drill with the
the plug-ins, you should be set.
</P>
<P>
   Is a cable modem worth the money?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that one you can only answer for yourself. But if you
mostly use the Net for e-mail, a cable modem will not radically
change your experience. You'll have mail a bit quicker; that's
about it. In general, there's a kind of sliding scale in which you
measure your need against the price. (Unless you are wealthy, in
which case, what are you waiting for?)
</P>
<P>
   Prices differ by company. MediaOne charges a one-time $100 fee
plus about $40 a month if you already have its cable television
service and $50 a month if you do not.
</P>
<P>
   So ask yourself where quick Internet access ranks against the
other telecommunications costs in your life.
</P>
<P>
   That $40 is a little above the average for what people pay for a
wireless phone and about twice the cost for local wired service. It
is about 50 percent higher than the basic bill for cable
television. It compares with $20 from many Internet service
providers for unlimited access to the Net via a dial-up modem.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the money, is there a downside?
</P>
<P>
   Sure. The worst thing about a cable modem is the higher
expectations. You think you will have instant access to whatever
you want on the Web _ you won't. You think your own computer's
foibles will disappear _ forget it. You think that software will
always behave _ ha!
</P>
<P>
   You will expect video to look like it does on television, but it
won't. Mostly the playbacks are on spaces about 1 inch square.
That's adequate for watching but a far cry from prime time TV.
</P>
<P>
   You will, in short, run into many problems that are beyond the
control of the cable modem. It's like having a six-lane driveway
that connects you to the interstate of the Internet. It won't keep
your car from breaking down, and it won't stop you from getting
trapped in congestion outside Houston.
</P>
<P>
   It's always on _ so what?
</P>
<P>
   The continual connect has its advantages, mostly the obvious
ones. No wait for the modem to dial and no busy signals when it
does. If you tend to jump on and off the Net during the day, having
a waiting link lets you shave a few minutes and some annoyance.
That alone may not be worth the $20 premium over a typical Internet
service provider.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe the whole package is. If you are running any kind of
business that uses the Net, the expense, if modest, and the
guarantee of access can be critical. If you are a consumer with
disposable income, what about the value of hassle-free connections
plus entertainment and news?
</P>
<P>
   After all, in recent weeks I have watched clips of ``The Thin
Red Line.'' I've listened to attorney Charles Ruff talk about the
Clinton impeachment trial on a desktop radio while I surfed
elsewhere. After some frustrating fiddling with the plug-in, I've
heard and saw Sheryl Crow and was convinced that every day is a
winding road.
</P>
<P>
   I have also struggled with temperamental software that has
repeatedly paralyzed my poor Macintosh. There has been torrential
rain, angry winds and several brief power failures.
</P>
<P>
   Through all that, those green lights have stayed on. So far.

 &HT;    In 25 words or less, kids' take on taxes
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It only costs a stamp and they're too young to be
audited, so why not? The folks who make TurboTax are sponsoring a
contest to get grade school kids to contribute their 2 cents' worth
about taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit, the company that makes TurboTax, a tax preparation
software program, is sponsoring a contest called ``Kids Speak Out
About Taxes.'' The contest asks kids in the third through fifth
grades to take no more than 25 words to tell how they think the
feds should spend their parents' tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
   One kid will get a $1,500 contribution toward an education
individual retirement account established in his or her name by
Intuit. Ten semifinalists will get a $50 U.S. Savings Bond.
</P>
<P>
   All of the winning entries will be published in a newsletter
sent to members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The contest runs until Feb. 26. It is open to all elementary
school children in grades three through five who are legal
residents of the United States and who attend American public,
private or parochial schools.
</P>
<P>
   Participants can enter the contest over the Internet, by fax or
by regular mail. To enter online, go to the Taxes area of
Quicken.com at http://www.quicken.com. To enter by fax or mail,
include this typed information: your name, the name and address of
your school, what grade you're in, your complete home mailing
address, your home phone number, and fax and e-mail addresses if
you have them.
</P>
<P>
   Entries can be faxed to 619-784-1385, or mailed to: TurboTax
``Kids Speak Out About Taxes'' Contest, Intuit Public Relations,
6220 Greenwich Drive, San Diego, CA 92122.

   Site coordinates job opportunities
</P>
<P>
   The folks behind the Monster Board and the Online Career Center
have joined forces to bring you http://www.monster.com, an online
job-hunting site.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which launched this month, lists 145,000 jobs and more
than 1 million resumes.
</P>
<P>
   The new sites offers a feature called ``my monster,'' which lets
you customize the site. Users can access a password-protected site
and create and store online resume, cover letters and material
about job searches. Membership is free.
</P>
<P>
   The site also offers resume tracking, which lets anxious job
hunters see how many times their resume is looked at by prospective
employers. The site has a privacy option that lets job-seekers
choose to not reveal their contact information.
</P>
<P>
   Online job sites are among the Internet's most popular.
MediaMetrix lists Monster.com as one of its 500 most popular Web
sites for December. A Forrester Research study predicts dollars
spent on online recruitment advertising will grow from $105 million
in 1998 to $1.7 billion by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Thieves strike at office
</P>
<P>
   A computer security company sponsored a study of computer theft
_ the low-tech kind _ and found most computers are most frequently
stolen from offices.
</P>
<P>
   The Kensington Technology Group Computer Security Survey asked
251 information services or information technology workers at
companies with at least $10 million in revenue. They found most
laptop computers are stolen inside the office, 41 percent. Cars and
cabs, 12.4 percent; airports, 8.4 percent; and hotels, 5.6 percent,
also ranked high on the list of likely theft sites.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies, 62 percent, use things like security guards,
gates and badges to keep employees from stealing computers. Fewer
companies used cable and locks and motion alarms to prevent theft,
according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune 1000 companies are more likely to have experienced
computer theft and to have lost more money to hardware, software
and information theft than smaller companies with more than $10
million in revenue.

 &HT;    To sharpen skills, pick proper search engine for each job
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Most of us spend a lifetime searching, whether it is
for the secret of life, our lost car keys or for the place you
stashed your Aunt Sally's recipe for chili.
</P>
<P>
   Just as you'd suspect, life on the Web mirrors life. As the Web
has become a tool, instead of just an amusement (when is the last
time you heard someone say they planned to ``surf'' the Web?
Nowadays we navigate it), the ability to search for needed
information has become more important.
</P>
<P>
   While it is mildly amusing to be searching for information about
wartime Germany for your child's homework project and to get
instead dozens of pages about German shepherds, German measles and
German chocolate, it isn't good use of your limited time.
</P>
<P>
   There's an art to searching the Web, and today we'll talk about
some techniques that will help make your own searches _ whether you
are using the Web for fun, school or work _ more profitable.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to know is that not all search engines are the
same. Each has a personality all its own. There are way too many
search engines to cover them all, but we'll talk about a few of
them and, as we do, discuss the kind of search that each does best.
That way, you can start by tailoring the choice of a search engine
to the information you seek.
</P>
<P>
   For a search such as the one in our example, Yahoo!
(http://www.yahoo.com) is best. If your topic is general and it is
likely that a lot of resources exist, go to Yahoo!. But if your
search is very narrow and for information that is likely to be
rare, try AltaVista (http://www.altavisita.com) instead. And when
you're really at a loss, searching for needles in haystacks, try
Dogpile (http://www.dogpile.com), which in turn uses multiple
search engines. You'll get a lot of hits that way, but the downside
is there will be more information to sift through.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's talk about ways to sharpen your search. As you
probably know, these engines seek out pages that contain the search
words you use. That's why it's important to select words precisely.
Most searches are literal. If you are looking for German shepherd
dogs and then use the word ``canine,'' with most search engines,
you'll only get pages with that specific word.
</P>
<P>
   We'll use AltaVista as an example of a way to narrow a search.
Let's say you are looking for information on wartime Germany. You
could simply type in the words ``German war WWII world war II'' and
you're likely to get a lot of hits. But, based on the way AltaVista
works, you would find pages that contained any one of those words.
So you'll also find pages about German culture, about every war
since the War of the Roses, and any page with the word ``world'' in
it.
</P>
<P>
   With AltaVista, you instruct the search engine to find pages
with a combination of words. By putting a plus sign in front of
words, you let AltaVista know the word must appear. So if you
changed your search to something like this (+Germany +world +war
+WWII), you would only get pages that had each word. You'll get few
hits, but the likelihood increases that each page will have the
information you seek. Since each search engine requires different
techniques, be sure to read the help section on those pages to get
tips for narrowing your search.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it's a good idea to explore carefully when you find a
page that is on the money. Many of the pages you find will offer
links to similar sites. That way you can use the expertise of the
designers of the good pages to locate similar ones.
</P>
<P>
   If you follow today's advice, you should be able to do a better
job when you search. I cannot, however, help you with your car
keys.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you tell me who pays for the gown Laura Bush wore for
the inauguration proceedings? Do Gov. and Mrs. Bush, out of their
private funds, or does the tax payer? _Melanie G.
</P>
<P>
   A: Your tax dollars are safe. While the rent is free at the
Governor's Mansion, little else is. The Michael Faircloth-designed
gown was paid for with personal funds, says governor's office
spokeswoman Karen Hughes. (Its price has not been made public.) To
add to the ``aaahhhhh'' factor, Mrs. Bush received flower-shaped
earrings as an inaugural gift from the governor. Meanwhile, Gov.
Bush wore a new tuxedo, a Christmas present from Mrs. Bush. So much
for that ``no new tuxes'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I want to know if you can get for me the recipe for mesquite
bean jelly. _Jake Pickle
</P>
<P>
   A: The mesquite bean jelly recipe seems like a challenge because
the beans must be at a certain stage in maturity _ when the red
color begins to show on the pods. For a copy of the directions,
courtesy of the Travis County Extension Service, send me a stamped,
self-addressed envelope. And, Congressman, let me know how your
first batch turns out.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have some beautiful red and yellow leaves that I would like
to preserve. Is there a way to preserve their color? _Dyan D.
</P>
<P>
   A: No guarantee, but some good ideas. A nice drink of glycerin
works on freshly cut magnolia branches, but the leaves have been
off the tree for a bit. The professionals at Preserved Flowers
suggest dipping the leaves in floor wax. A friend whose dinner
table always reflects the seasons shared her secret. She collects
interesting leaves and pods and stores them in plastic trash bags
with a twist tie in the garage. (A spritz of insecticide or diluted
soap water kills any bugs). The leaves are out of the sun and wind.
Do not place anything heavy on the bag. Leaves are pretty hardy and
should last several years without much tending.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you know where I can get a one-handed knife? It is used by
people who are paralyzed on one side, and I would love to get one
for my sister. _Pat N.
</P>
<P>
   A: The knife is probably a ``rocker knife,'' which allows an
individual to cut with a rocking motion rather than a sawing
motion. It is available in various sizes from catalogs such as
Enrichments, at (800) 435-8573. A similar product is the
all-in-one-hand cutlery set _ a combination lightweight knife and
fork, designed to be operated by either hand alone. The fork
retracts for easy closing and the user's lips are protected from
the knife's edge. For a consultation on the hundreds of products to
aid your sister, call Assistive Devices at 346-0889. There are also
cutting boards and plates with corners and spikes to anchor foods.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I need to store a wooden armoire in a commercial storage
room. Is there anything I can do to help retain the natural beauty
of the wood? Is it harmful to store this for a long time? _Patricia
Abram
</P>
<P>
   A: When you say commercial storage, do you mean
climate-controlled? If the temperature is kept between 60 and 85
degrees and the humidity is regulated, the armoire will be fine.
Here are a few points on storage from Michael Christian at
Restoration Shop. If possible, store the armoire assembled; if not,
place the doors and sides flat (on plywood or some sort of pallet
to protect from moisture). Rest the base against the flat sides and
the bonnet on the base. Resting these pieces flat avoids the
dreaded potato chip effect that can happen when wood warps. Before
placing in storage, give the armoire a lemon oil treatment and make
sure it is covered with a dust protective cloth. Check on the piece
in three to six months just to make sure all is well.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am a teacher and I contribute to TRS (Teacher Retirement
System). I have also worked at various jobs in the summers to get
in my 40 quarters with the Social Security system. How will my
pensions be distributed and will I be able to qualify for both when
I retire? Some say I will only receive TRS benefits, while others
tell me I will get both, but at a smaller percentage. _ James Hood
</P>
<P>
   A: I put your questions to the professionals at the Teacher
Retirement System and the Social Security Administration. TRS
spokesman Howard Goldman says some school districts elect to
participate in Social Security, some do not. Regardless of your
district's decision, TRS benefits are not affected by other jobs
you may have had over the years. Meanwhile, over at the Social
Security Administration, Sandra Talbot notes benefits depend on
your ``average covered earning over your lifetime,'' which is
calculated by a standard formula. If you receive a pension from a
job ``where you did not pay Social Security taxes, a different
formula may be used to figure your benefit amount.'' For a free
estimate of what your benefit will be, call (800) 772-1213. Bottom
line? You do receive both TRS and Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have a problem with silverfish in our house, especially in
the kitchen cabinets. We have used moth balls, but to no avail.
Also, a friend told me that moth balls are toxic. _ Sue A.
</P>
<P>
   A: Moth balls are toxic _ careful around pets and children.
Silverfish are annoying and are commonly found in moist, warm
locations (sink and faucet fixtures). Try eliminating the moisture
where they appear. Readers have reported success with herbal
remedies such as vetiver (dried or oil). Another solution is
unwrapped sticks of Wrigley's Spearmint gum _ a reader suggestion,
not Wrigley's.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What final disposition is made of the module panels removed,
and the hundreds of bolts and pins used to stabilize the new space
station connection during the Endeavour's mission? _ Jeanne M.
</P>
<P>
   A: This hardware, says NASA spokesman Phil West, has been
returned to NASA in Houston and will either be reused on future
modules, employed for training crews or used for engineering
purposes on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Upshot/Update/Uproar:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Southwest Indian Foundation is a source for quality
crafted Native American jewelry, pottery and gifts from sources
like the Navajo tribe as well as the pueblo tribes of the Zuni,
Laguna, Acoma and Hopi. This nonprofit organization uses proceeds
to benefit Native Americans. For a catalog call (800) 504-2723.

 &HT;    I'll do it my way, just like in the good old days
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Because this column appears in the technology section
of the newspaper, I am often mistaken for a technological sort of
person, riding right out there on the cutting edge of science.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, every time I get near the cutting edge of anything I
wind up in need of Band-Aids. Technology so seldom actually bends
itself to my will that I'm usually startled when, upon screwing in
a new light bulb, it actually lights up.
</P>
<P>
   This lamentable condition was demonstrated yet again the other
day when it was decided that I should cover an event that was going
to be held a hundred miles or so from home, and would not end until
very close to deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Now, gather round, children, and let me tell you how we did this
sort of thing in the olden days. In the olden days we didn't have
things like computers. We didn't have cellular telephones, either.
Reporters carried a notebook, several cheap pens and some quarters.
</P>
<P>
   If the event took place somewhere the telephone company hadn't
grown any pay phones, we knocked on somebody's door and asked if we
could use their telephone. Since there weren't any 800 lines, and
nobody had thought of calling cards, we called the office collect.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was an archaic interaction in which the reporter
dictated over the phone, to someone at a typewriter in the office,
a usable story, or a portion thereof. Now, with the New Technology,
having to take dictation from a reporter appears to be a fate so
degrading as to warrant self-immolation.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, it was decreed that in order to file a story
following this event, I should take a Macintosh Powerbook, along
with a small contraption that would connect the Powerbook to my
cell phone. Why, with this, I could file from anywhere, even from a
speeding car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't work,'' I told them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it will,'' they replied. ``It always works.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not for me, it won't,'' I said. ``Things like this never work
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   No amount of whining would get me out of it, because, I was
told, the office was too shorthanded to take dictation.
</P>
<P>
   As if we were longhanded in the olden days.
</P>
<P>
   Two nights later, I was sitting in a burger joint, starving
while my companions taunted me with their Biggy Fries, finishing up
a piece written on the Powerbook in pidgin English in a dark car
careening at 90 mph down the interstate.
</P>
<P>
   After innumerable contretemps with the Powerbook, which I hope
never to see again, I finally got everything hooked up and did what
I had been told to do. As expected, it did nothing. Zilch. Wouldn't
even dial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah,'' they had told me. ``You'll see the numbers run
right across the screen of your cell phone.'' Nothing, except for a
few stray grains of salt, ran across the screen of my cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   So I unplugged the apparatus and called the office. To my great
good fortune, it was answered by a gentleman named Doug Payne,
whose olden days, while not so elder as mine, are olden enough to
include shame-free dictation. My gravelly whine synched with his
typing system, and the story was transmitted in the olden way.
</P>
<P>
   Codgers uber alles.

 &HT;    Car trouble? Maybe online expert can help
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Once upon a time, before the age of computers, cars
were the chief source of aggravation in most folks' lives. The act
of keeping them in good repair and figuring out their intricacies
took up great chunks of free time.
</P>
<P>
   Now computers create the same worries. So it is only fair that
today, with the help of the Web, we investigate ways computers and
the Internet can help solve your automotive problems and worries.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say that, for instance, you have a 1991 Ford Taurus that
makes a strange ker-plunka, ker-plunka sound when you attempt to
drive up an incline. You could drive it down to the dealership that
sold it to you (which isn't such a dumb idea), or you could try to
find out a little about the problem in advance (not so dumb
either). That way, even if it isn't something you can fix yourself,
you'll sound a bit more knowledgeable at the garage.
</P>
<P>
   There are several Web sites that offer advice and tips, but the
beauty of the Allexperts.com auto repair page is that you can ask
specific questions. If you go to the page at
http://www.allexperts.com/cars
</P>
<P>
   /repairs.shtml you'll be able to click on the model of car you
own and then send e-mail to an expert. Since this is a free service
and since the experts are all volunteers, it's a good starting
point. And there is a fairly straightforward description of each
expert's qualifications. That way, you'll have a fair idea of how
much faith to put in the advice you get.
</P>
<P>
   The Automobile Troubleshooter at
http://www.diadex.com/expert/auto/index.html isn't as personal as
our first site, but it is free and can be helpful. You start by
selecting the general type of automotive problem _ for instance,
whether the engine will start, or transmission problems.
</P>
<P>
   Then you'll be asked a series of questions. Each question
presumably narrows the list of probable problems. It's not the sort
of information that will offer you a sure-fire answer to your
problem, but it does do a good job of rounding up the logical
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Our next Web site is run by Tom and Ray Magliozzi (a.k.a ``Click
and Clack: The Tappet Brothers''). These are busy brothers. They
have a national radio show and also produce a syndicated column.
The Web site, at http://cartalk.cars.com/, has a lot of features,
including an archive of past columns.
</P>
<P>
   But let's talk about that ker-plunka, ker-plunka sound we
mentioned earlier. A lot of times novices tend to describe car
problems in terms of the noise they make. You may be surprised to
know that _ just as is true with a physician _ sounds are important
to a mechanic, too.
</P>
<P>
   This site offers you the opportunity at
http://cartalk.cars.com/About/Noises/ to actually listen to a
sampling of sound files and try to match them with what you're
hearing from your car. It's a novel approach to remote diagnostics,
and even if it doesn't work, you'll have fun trying.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you'll notice _ if you search the Web for automobile
advice sites _ that many of the places you find are commercial.
You'll pay (usually about $20) for advice by e-mail. Without ruling
on the merits of these sites (to really judge them fairly, you'd
have to submit a series of questions and then compare the results
with what a real-world mechanic would find), we'll just note that
if you are willing to pay for advice, a mechanic locally (even one
not as skilled) has a real advantage over distant experts, since he
or she can actually see and hear the problem.

 &HT;    Apple comeback stems from iMac
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Powered by a little computer that looks like an
iridescent gumdrop, Apple Computer continues to grow stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Its iMac computer was ranked No. 1 or 4, depending on what
survey you believe, in sales among all computers in the final three
months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That's one heck of an accomplishment for a company that had been
all but written off a year ago. Now listen to what top analysts are
saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question (Apple will be) a strong player,'' Stephen
Baker, a research analyst at PC Data, recently told online news
service ZDNet.
</P>
<P>
   In its latest industry survey, PC Data ranked the iMac as the
top seller among PCs in last year's fourth quarter. It said the
iMac accounted for 6.2 percent of volume sales and 7.2 percent of
the dollar amount.
</P>
<P>
   Since its August debut, the iMac has captured 6 percent of all
computer sales, according the PC Data survey. It has stayed among
the top five best-sellers since August. In the fiercely competitive
PC world, in which new models are continually introduced at lower
prices, few stay on top for long.
</P>
<P>
   The same may be happening with the iMac. While No. 1 through the
last three months of 1998, the iMac's position began eroding
sharply in December. It lost its first-place mantle to Compaq's
Presario models.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason Apple has tried jazzing up the iMac,
announcing it will now come in five new iridescent colors.
</P>
<P>
   PC Data's survey ranked the iMac higher than other competing
surveys. ZD Market Intelligence, for example, ranked iMac the
fourth-best-selling PC.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the two surveys is in what was counted.
ZD Market Intelligence counted only sales at retailers, such as
electronic superstores.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, PC Data counted both retail and mail-order sales.
</P>
<P>
   Mail-order sales are significant for the Mac. Mac enthusiasts
tend to be more sophisticated about computers than their PC
counterparts. Many know exactly what they want, shopping strictly
by price.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of prices, it is the one area in which most analysts
believe Apple remains vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Says ZD Market Intelligence analyst Matt Sargent, in an online
interview, ``To improve results in the retail stores, Apple needs
to continue to lower the prices of its systems to compete more
effectively against sub-$1,000 offerings from PC vendors.''

 &HT;    Cable modem a marvel, but not a miracle
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The two little green lights shine unblinking, all
through the night.
</P>
<P>
   And all through the day, too. The connection stays constant,
from desktop to the Internet whether the computer is booted up,
shut down or just plain crashed. But get that computer running,
open your Netscape browser and you are on the Net with the promise
of stunningly fast surfing and blazing downloads.
</P>
<P>
   It's a cable modem.
</P>
<P>
   But is it everything you've wanted? You have to wonder, whether
you use the 'Net for business or entertainment, amusement or
commerce. Because you have heard the talk _ not to mention the
hype. Talk of broadband via cable modem or digital subscriber lines
from a phone company, billion-dollar deals involving Internet or
phone companies aiming to offer fancier content via zippier access.
</P>
<P>
   You have added interest if you have a dial-up service to the
'Net and been angered by frequent busy signals _ not to mention
aggravated by that annoying sound a modem makes dialing in to the
server. Or maybe you've had the connection broken a few times. Most
of all, you have perhaps been frustrated at how long it takes to
download files, to view video clips or graphics.
</P>
<P>
   If that is you, you are looking for a better way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is broadband,'' proclaims MediaOne. ``This is the way.''
So we took a look, hoping to answer _ at least partially _ some of
the questions that would be asked by any potential customer. For
instance: Just how fast is it?
</P>
<P>
   In theory, cable modems are more than 100 times faster than a
standard modem. A cable modem can handle more than 10 million bits
of information per second, vs. 28,800 bits for many modems and
56,000 bits for the fastest dial-up modems.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the number can be a lot lower for any method you
use to connect. MediaOne says you should expect no more than about
1.5 million bits per second from the cable modem, since
transmission speeds are dependent on a number of factors. If you
hit a clogged server or a congested line, it won't matter much that
you have lightning speed on the final leg of the trip, said Tom
Buttermore, MediaOne's director of high-speed data.
</P>
<P>
   Critics _ often folks from the phone companies _ argue that
cable modems are oversold, that cable doesn't have the reliability
of a phone line. Would you lose your 'Net link as often as your
cable television? What happens in a storm? Also, if all your
neighbors were to sign up for cable modems, it could affect the
speed. But cable companies shrug off that criticism, saying they
can install more equipment in the neighborhood to take care of it.
</P>
<P>
   During my most intensive downloading, I haven't seen the average
speed of my cable modem break past 100 kilobytes per second _
roughly 1 million bits of data _ based on the count on the bottom
bar of my browser. Not bad at all, but not radically better than
what I get at work through a T-1 line.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm not going to have a high-speed T-1 line at home, only a
dial-up modem. And the real story isn't the numbers _ it's the
time. If you compare it with ad nauseam waits for downloading, then
the cable modem is definitely a treat. When I downloaded a new
version of Netscape on my 28.8 modem, it took about 52 minutes. A
few months after, the cable modem was installed and I started
thinking about a Netscape upgrade. It took about 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   I peeked at a trailer for the new ``Star Wars'' flick, a preview
file consisting of 969,000 bits of data. It took 2 minutes to
download and made me wish I'd gone to the Jedi academy.
</P>
<P>
   What is installation like?
</P>
<P>
   It isn't like a dial-up modem that you are expected to set up
yourself. And it isn't like a phone line that can be turned on by
the flick of a switch in some central office while you are out.
</P>
<P>
   Three trucks _ count 'em, three _ came to my house. Lines were
strung from the poles in the street, connected to the house and run
inside. A network interface card was popped into the computer and
some software configured.
</P>
<P>
   It took several hours. My presence was required.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I did order the complete package that included phone
service, along with cable television and the cable modem. That
clearly made the process more labor-intensive. (And as for the
MediaOne phone service, that's another story.)
</P>
<P>
   What's it like to use? What if there's trouble?
</P>
<P>
   The basics are a cinch. You are always connected, so you don't
need to either dial-up or wait for the connection. You launch the
browser, sit back a few seconds, and you are there.
</P>
<P>
   If there is trouble, MediaOne runs a technical support unit from
7 a.m. to midnight. The two times I needed them, they were patient
and helpful. I called once when I lost my connections and e-mail
after installing a new operating system on the Mac. The voice on
the other end was friendly, and her first question was about the
little green lights. ``Are they on?'' I assured her they were.
``Cool,'' she said, and walked me through a rewrite of my browser
settings. I was back in business in five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   What can you do with a cable modem that you couldn't do without
it?
</P>
<P>
   That could be the critical question. And the answer is less
dramatic than you'd think _ that is, if time means nothing to you.
After all, a dial-up modem can do the same things. But they do it
an awful lot more slowly than broadband.
</P>
<P>
   Do you want to watch a video clip, a 1.5 million-bit file? On a
standard modem, downloading that takes 6 minutes and change. Even
with a 56k modem, it's still at least 3 minutes. On the cable
modem, it should come in under 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Again, your mileage may vary _ remember that your connection
cannot help with congestion in a server in, say, Chicago. But in
most cases, broadband may not be the only way, but it sure is the
faster way.
</P>
<P>
   And some things that dial-up just can't do. For example, the
cable modem permits you to listen to ``streaming audio'' _ radio or
music _ while doing other work.
</P>
<P>
   The Net as a whole seems to be moving toward speed. Portal sites
are teaming with broadband providers to design content with high
speed in mind. Although analysts say the shift will take years, the
logic seems inexorable: Today's broadband experience will look
shabby compared to what's coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 56k-encoded video looks crummy on a 56k modem, and it looks
crummy on a cable modem, too,'' Buttermore said. ``But you are
starting to see more content for broadband.''
</P>
<P>
   So you just sit down that first day, turn on your Net radio and
start watching video clips?
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. ``Streaming'' data that make up audio and video
require specialized software like RealPlayer or Shockwave. Some
cable companies will set up your computer with that software, known
as plug-ins. MediaOne offers the next best thing, a free and
convenient download of plug-ins from its home page.
</P>
<P>
   But it took me a while to realize that, since the company hadn't
mentioned it during the installation and I was too boneheaded to
investigate the home page. Instead, I floundered around a bit,
searching for the right software and tentatively downloading this
and that. So the service seems not yet pitched for the newbie who
wants to log on and instantly watch video. The assumption seems to
be that anyone getting a cable modem is savvy enough to get the
advantages without hand-holding _ not an accurate assessment in my
case.
</P>
<P>
   If you have never downloaded anything before, or if you expect
instant karma, you might get impatient. And it's not the download
time, but the hassle. But once you go through the drill with the
the plug-ins, you should be set.
</P>
<P>
   Is a cable modem worth the money?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that one you can only answer for yourself. But if you
mostly use the Net for e-mail, a cable modem will not radically
change your experience. You'll have mail a bit quicker; that's
about it. In general, there's a kind of sliding scale in which you
measure your need against the price. (Unless you are wealthy, in
which case, what are you waiting for?)
</P>
<P>
   Prices differ by company. MediaOne charges a one-time $100 fee
plus about $40 a month if you already have its cable television
service and $50 a month if you do not.
</P>
<P>
   So ask yourself where quick Internet access ranks against the
other telecommunications costs in your life.
</P>
<P>
   That $40 is a little above the average for what people pay for a
wireless phone and about twice the cost for local wired service. It
is about 50 percent higher than the basic bill for cable
television. It compares with $20 from many Internet service
providers for unlimited access to the Net via a dial-up modem.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the money, is there a downside?
</P>
<P>
   Sure. The worst thing about a cable modem is the higher
expectations. You think you will have instant access to whatever
you want on the Web _ you won't. You think your own computer's
foibles will disappear _ forget it. You think that software will
always behave _ ha!
</P>
<P>
   You will expect video to look like it does on television, but it
won't. Mostly the playbacks are on spaces about 1 inch square.
That's adequate for watching but a far cry from prime time TV.
</P>
<P>
   You will, in short, run into many problems that are beyond the
control of the cable modem. It's like having a six-lane driveway
that connects you to the interstate of the Internet. It won't keep
your car from breaking down, and it won't stop you from getting
trapped in congestion outside Houston.
</P>
<P>
   It's always on _ so what?
</P>
<P>
   The continual connect has its advantages, mostly the obvious
ones. No wait for the modem to dial and no busy signals when it
does. If you tend to jump on and off the Net during the day, having
a waiting link lets you shave a few minutes and some annoyance.
That alone may not be worth the $20 premium over a typical Internet
service provider.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe the whole package is. If you are running any kind of
business that uses the Net, the expense, if modest, and the
guarantee of access can be critical. If you are a consumer with
disposable income, what about the value of hassle-free connections
plus entertainment and news?
</P>
<P>
   After all, in recent weeks I have watched clips of ``The Thin
Red Line.'' I've listened to attorney Charles Ruff talk about the
Clinton impeachment trial on a desktop radio while I surfed
elsewhere. After some frustrating fiddling with the plug-in, I've
heard and saw Sheryl Crow and was convinced that every day is a
winding road.
</P>
<P>
   I have also struggled with temperamental software that has
repeatedly paralyzed my poor Macintosh. There has been torrential
rain, angry winds and several brief power failures.
</P>
<P>
   Through all that, those green lights have stayed on. So far.

 &HT;    In 25 words or less, kids' take on taxes
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It only costs a stamp and they're too young to be
audited, so why not? The folks who make TurboTax are sponsoring a
contest to get grade school kids to contribute their 2 cents' worth
about taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit, the company that makes TurboTax, a tax preparation
software program, is sponsoring a contest called ``Kids Speak Out
About Taxes.'' The contest asks kids in the third through fifth
grades to take no more than 25 words to tell how they think the
feds should spend their parents' tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
   One kid will get a $1,500 contribution toward an education
individual retirement account established in his or her name by
Intuit. Ten semifinalists will get a $50 U.S. Savings Bond.
</P>
<P>
   All of the winning entries will be published in a newsletter
sent to members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The contest runs until Feb. 26. It is open to all elementary
school children in grades three through five who are legal
residents of the United States and who attend American public,
private or parochial schools.
</P>
<P>
   Participants can enter the contest over the Internet, by fax or
by regular mail. To enter online, go to the Taxes area of
Quicken.com at http://www.quicken.com. To enter by fax or mail,
include this typed information: your name, the name and address of
your school, what grade you're in, your complete home mailing
address, your home phone number, and fax and e-mail addresses if
you have them.
</P>
<P>
   Entries can be faxed to 619-784-1385, or mailed to: TurboTax
``Kids Speak Out About Taxes'' Contest, Intuit Public Relations,
6220 Greenwich Drive, San Diego, CA 92122.

   Site coordinates job opportunities
</P>
<P>
   The folks behind the Monster Board and the Online Career Center
have joined forces to bring you http://www.monster.com, an online
job-hunting site.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which launched this month, lists 145,000 jobs and more
than 1 million resumes.
</P>
<P>
   The new sites offers a feature called ``my monster,'' which lets
you customize the site. Users can access a password-protected site
and create and store online resume, cover letters and material
about job searches. Membership is free.
</P>
<P>
   The site also offers resume tracking, which lets anxious job
hunters see how many times their resume is looked at by prospective
employers. The site has a privacy option that lets job-seekers
choose to not reveal their contact information.
</P>
<P>
   Online job sites are among the Internet's most popular.
MediaMetrix lists Monster.com as one of its 500 most popular Web
sites for December. A Forrester Research study predicts dollars
spent on online recruitment advertising will grow from $105 million
in 1998 to $1.7 billion by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Thieves strike at office
</P>
<P>
   A computer security company sponsored a study of computer theft
_ the low-tech kind _ and found most computers are most frequently
stolen from offices.
</P>
<P>
   The Kensington Technology Group Computer Security Survey asked
251 information services or information technology workers at
companies with at least $10 million in revenue. They found most
laptop computers are stolen inside the office, 41 percent. Cars and
cabs, 12.4 percent; airports, 8.4 percent; and hotels, 5.6 percent,
also ranked high on the list of likely theft sites.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies, 62 percent, use things like security guards,
gates and badges to keep employees from stealing computers. Fewer
companies used cable and locks and motion alarms to prevent theft,
according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune 1000 companies are more likely to have experienced
computer theft and to have lost more money to hardware, software
and information theft than smaller companies with more than $10
million in revenue.

 &HT;    I'll do it my way, just like in the good old days
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Because this column appears in the technology section
of the newspaper, I am often mistaken for a technological sort of
person, riding right out there on the cutting edge of science.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, every time I get near the cutting edge of anything I
wind up in need of Band-Aids. Technology so seldom actually bends
itself to my will that I'm usually startled when, upon screwing in
a new light bulb, it actually lights up.
</P>
<P>
   This lamentable condition was demonstrated yet again the other
day when it was decided that I should cover an event that was going
to be held a hundred miles or so from home, and would not end until
very close to deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Now, gather round, children, and let me tell you how we did this
sort of thing in the olden days. In the olden days we didn't have
things like computers. We didn't have cellular telephones, either.
Reporters carried a notebook, several cheap pens and some quarters.
</P>
<P>
   If the event took place somewhere the telephone company hadn't
grown any pay phones, we knocked on somebody's door and asked if we
could use their telephone. Since there weren't any 800 lines, and
nobody had thought of calling cards, we called the office collect.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was an archaic interaction in which the reporter
dictated over the phone, to someone at a typewriter in the office,
a usable story, or a portion thereof. Now, with the New Technology,
having to take dictation from a reporter appears to be a fate so
degrading as to warrant self-immolation.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, it was decreed that in order to file a story
following this event, I should take a Macintosh Powerbook, along
with a small contraption that would connect the Powerbook to my
cell phone. Why, with this, I could file from anywhere, even from a
speeding car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't work,'' I told them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it will,'' they replied. ``It always works.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not for me, it won't,'' I said. ``Things like this never work
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   No amount of whining would get me out of it, because, I was
told, the office was too shorthanded to take dictation.
</P>
<P>
   As if we were longhanded in the olden days.
</P>
<P>
   Two nights later, I was sitting in a burger joint, starving
while my companions taunted me with their Biggy Fries, finishing up
a piece written on the Powerbook in pidgin English in a dark car
careening at 90 mph down the interstate.
</P>
<P>
   After innumerable contretemps with the Powerbook, which I hope
never to see again, I finally got everything hooked up and did what
I had been told to do. As expected, it did nothing. Zilch. Wouldn't
even dial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah,'' they had told me. ``You'll see the numbers run
right across the screen of your cell phone.'' Nothing, except for a
few stray grains of salt, ran across the screen of my cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   So I unplugged the apparatus and called the office. To my great
good fortune, it was answered by a gentleman named Doug Payne,
whose olden days, while not so elder as mine, are olden enough to
include shame-free dictation. My gravelly whine synched with his
typing system, and the story was transmitted in the olden way.
</P>

   Codgers uber alles.

 &HT;    To sharpen skills, pick proper search engine for each job
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Most of us spend a lifetime searching, whether it is
for the secret of life, our lost car keys or for the place you
stashed your Aunt Sally's recipe for chili.
</P>
<P>
   Just as you'd suspect, life on the Web mirrors life. As the Web
has become a tool, instead of just an amusement (when is the last
time you heard someone say they planned to ``surf'' the Web?
Nowadays we navigate it), the ability to search for needed
information has become more important.
</P>
<P>
   While it is mildly amusing to be searching for information about
wartime Germany for your child's homework project and to get
instead dozens of pages about German shepherds, German measles and
German chocolate, it isn't good use of your limited time.
</P>
<P>
   There's an art to searching the Web, and today we'll talk about
some techniques that will help make your own searches _ whether you
are using the Web for fun, school or work _ more profitable.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to know is that not all search engines are the
same. Each has a personality all its own. There are way too many
search engines to cover them all, but we'll talk about a few of
them and, as we do, discuss the kind of search that each does best.
That way, you can start by tailoring the choice of a search engine
to the information you seek.
</P>
<P>
   For a search such as the one in our example, Yahoo!
(http://www.yahoo.com) is best. If your topic is general and it is
likely that a lot of resources exist, go to Yahoo!. But if your
search is very narrow and for information that is likely to be
rare, try AltaVista (http://www.altavisita.com) instead. And when
you're really at a loss, searching for needles in haystacks, try
Dogpile (http://www.dogpile.com), which in turn uses multiple
search engines. You'll get a lot of hits that way, but the downside
is there will be more information to sift through.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's talk about ways to sharpen your search. As you
probably know, these engines seek out pages that contain the search
words you use. That's why it's important to select words precisely.
Most searches are literal. If you are looking for German shepherd
dogs and then use the word ``canine,'' with most search engines,
you'll only get pages with that specific word.
</P>
<P>
   We'll use AltaVista as an example of a way to narrow a search.
Let's say you are looking for information on wartime Germany. You
could simply type in the words ``German war WWII world war II'' and
you're likely to get a lot of hits. But, based on the way AltaVista
works, you would find pages that contained any one of those words.
So you'll also find pages about German culture, about every war
since the War of the Roses, and any page with the word ``world'' in
it.
</P>
<P>
   With AltaVista, you instruct the search engine to find pages
with a combination of words. By putting a plus sign in front of
words, you let AltaVista know the word must appear. So if you
changed your search to something like this (+Germany +world +war
+WWII), you would only get pages that had each word. You'll get few
hits, but the likelihood increases that each page will have the
information you seek. Since each search engine requires different
techniques, be sure to read the help section on those pages to get
tips for narrowing your search.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it's a good idea to explore carefully when you find a
page that is on the money. Many of the pages you find will offer
links to similar sites. That way you can use the expertise of the
designers of the good pages to locate similar ones.
</P>
<P>
   If you follow today's advice, you should be able to do a better
job when you search. I cannot, however, help you with your car
keys.

   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ A trip to Dr. Tunnel to find out
what's wrong with my voice revealed an unexpected diagnosis:

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ When the Clintons first
moved into the White House, I paid particular attention to stories
about Socks and how he was adjusting to his new home. I worried he
might get stuck in an elevator or maybe slip out the front door and
be trampled by a crowd of demonstrators on Pennsylvania Avenue.
Most of all, I wondered where they were going to put the sandbox.
As far back as memory serves, there have been cats in my life.

they hear no uncertainty from him about what he believes is right

teens seek guidance. And John Paul II doesn't wait for young people
to come to him. He seeks them out. So should we. (Walker, Longview

 STEERING IN fILTHY WATERS  
 (For release Wednesday Feb. 3)  
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While I generally disapprove of cursing and refrain from doing
it unless sorely provoked by something like a television commercial
or a broken shoelace, I sympathize with the Michigan canoeist who
was ticketed for cursing after he fell out of his boat.
</P>
<P>
   According to a sheriff's deputy, Timothy Boomer, 24, unleashed a
three-minute tirade of undeleted expletives loud enough to be heard
by people a quarter-mile away, including a woman and her two small
children.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Boomer faces a maximum of 90 days in jail and a
$100 fine for violating an 1897 state law that prohibits cursing in
front of women and children.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union is trying to get the case
dismissed on the grounds that the old (and seldom enforced) law is
an unconstitutional violation of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   While the Associated Press story did not explain how or why
Boomer fell out of his canoe, a three-minute string of cursing
strikes me as an appropriate response to such a mishap.
</P>
<P>
   The tirade might be somewhat longer if an expensive camera fell
overboard, or somewhat shorter if all that got wet were some empty
beer cans and a half-full bag of stale potato chips.
</P>
<P>
   Canoes are notoriously hard to steer, especially if you try to
drink beer and eat stale potato chips while paddling.
</P>
<P>
   A canoe can sense when you're reaching for a beer or a
potato-chip bag and will instantly veer toward the nearest
half-submerged log or overhanging tree limbs dripping with
poisonous snakes.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse is the fact that canoeing is often a
husband/wife-boyfriend/girlfriend undertaking, meaning that
emotions are usually frayed long before anyone steps in the boat.
</P>
<P>
   An ostensibly peaceful glide down the river can quickly turn
into the kind of domestic tragedy that makes the movie ``The
Shining'' seem like a romantic getaway.
</P>
<P>
   I recall a canoeing adventure some years back in which my wife
and I were accompanied by another married couple, Vicki and Dan.
Dan, being the more experienced canoeist, took the rear seat of the
canoe so that he could drink beer and eat potato chips unobserved
while his wife did all the paddling. Occasionally, Dan would pause
from eating and drinking long enough to bark some helpful canoeing
advice to the back of Vicki's head, such as ``The left the left the
left! Paddle on the left, dammit!''
</P>
<P>
   After a few minutes of this, Vicki quit paddling altogether and
got into an animated discussion with Dan about where he might want
to stick his paddle, seeing as he wasn't using it anyway. This, of
course, was the signal to the canoe to veer sharply in the
direction of some low-hanging branches over which a long dark snake
about as big around as Mark McGwire's forearm was draped.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki turned around just in time to see the snake drop into the
canoe where her lap would have been had she not already departed
the canoe in a modified half-gainer, sending the camera, the
lantern, the tent, the food and, most tragically of all, the beer
into the river with her.
</P>
<P>
   As she floundered about in water that she (understandably)
thought was teeming with snakes sporting fangs the size of turkey
basters, Vicki commenced a barrage of profanity that far exceeded
the three-minute mark set by Timothy Boomer of Michigan, the
so-called ``cursing canoeist.''
</P>
<P>
   If there were any nearby mothers with children who were offended
by Vicki's tirade, they did not make their presence known. It's
possible that their ears melted or they spontaneously combusted,
it's really hard to say. Even the snake, which turned out to be
sized more along the lines of Calista Flockhart's pinky than Mark
McGwire's forearm, seemed stunned and embarrassed. I think if it
was capable of leaping back into the tree, it would have.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the snake and Vicki traded places and our canoeing
adventure resumed. Vicki dried off and calmed down and Dan even saw
fit to paddle some in order to catch up with the beer floating down
the river.
</P>
<P>
   That provoked some cussin', too, but nothing too outrageous.
</P>
<P>

IMPEACHMENT: THE SOAP OPERA THAT AMERICA WANTS CANCELED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.)  
(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c. 1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The impeachment soap opera continued last week, with Rep. Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., whining about a U.S. Senate motion to dismiss the
articles of impeachment. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Hyde,
using a ``poor me, you've hurt my feelings'' voice, noted that he
had looked up ``dismiss'' in a thesaurus and found it meant
``disdain,'' ``reject'' and ``disregard.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow attorney Hyde missed the first listed synonym,
``acquit.'' Hyde was over-acting, which isn't necessarily a sin in
soap opera land, and over-reacting, which has become the meat and
gravy of political discourse nowadays. The Democrats' motion to
dismiss was voted down by the Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
   And U.S. House impeachment managers were wringing their hands
about the number of witnesses they wanted to parade before the
Senate, only to be spurned by the Senate leadership. The House
witness wish list was trimmed to three: Monica Lewinsky, Vernon
Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   It is likely they will only appear for depositions.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers seem to have forgotten that the Senate has
``the sole power to try all impeachments'' according to Article I,
Section 3, Clause 6 of the U.S. Constitution. ``Sole power'' means
precisely that. The phrase ``sole power'' is only used twice in the
Constitution, both in regard to impeachment. In other words, the
Senate can do what it pleases in an impeachment trial, no matter
what House managers think.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution grants the House of Representatives the ``sole
power of impeachment'' in Article I, Section 2, Clause 5 _ but it
does not give the House the authority to tell the Senate how to try
an impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the U.S. Supreme Court can interfere with that
authority. In the Judge Walter Nixon vs. U.S. (1993) case, a
majority of the Supreme Court concluded that whether an impeachment
process is proper or not is a political question that can only be
answered by the legislative branch of government. Chief Justice
William Rehnquist wrote for the majority that the Constitution
forbids the judiciary any authority to review impeachments and
impeachment trials.
</P>
<P>
   The high court is correct in describing impeachment as a
political process. This impeachment stinks of it.
</P>
<P>
   House managers and the Senate devotees of the radical right
became hysterical after President Clinton delivered his State of
the Union address on Jan. 19. It was presidential. It spoke to
issues that Americans have on their minds, avoided any mention of
impeachment and it was delivered with consummate skill.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment fanatics burned on their own pyres. Their screams of
outrage could be heard on TV sets around the world.
</P>
<P>
   This is one soap opera that Americans want canceled _ yesterday.
And they won't forget. They have seen the right-wing of the
Republican Party shamelessly drive the rest of their party over
this impeachment cliff, as if they were no more than a troop of
lemmings.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Senate and House leaders claim they are only carrying
out their constitutional duty _ continuing the farce by deposing
witnesses who have testified numerous times already _ as much as
they hate to do so. In light of the high court's 1993 decision,
however, the Senate can truncate the trial process anytime and in
any manner and still be fulfilling its constitutional duty. The
Constitution has very little to say about the process. It grants
the Senate authority to try impeachments, says senators must be
under oath or affirmation, tells who presides when a president is
impeached, and spells out the vote necessary to find a person
convicted of an article of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   That's it.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate could have dismissed the case after senators had
heard the articles of impeachment. It could have dismissed the case
after House managers defended the articles, or after White House
attorneys rebutted the charges.
</P>
<P>
   But the GOP must appease the Pat Robertson, Gary Bauer, Pat
Buchanan and James Dobson wing of the party. They are not easily
appeased. They have been after Clinton's head since he was first
elected.
</P>
<P>
   They were dismayed by the nerve of American voters to elect a
Democrat as president. They were disgruntled by the polls that
showed two-thirds of the American public didn't want Clinton
impeached. And they deplore the fact that more than two-thirds of
Americans want the trial over and Clinton to remain in office. So
they shake their sage heads and wag their fingers at the loss of
purity and morality in our nation.
</P>
<P>
   These are the simple men. Complexity of the human spirit is
beyond their ken. They do not understand that a person may not be a
faithful spouse yet still be a rightfully acclaimed brain surgeon
or great leader. These are the simple men. They do not even
understand the complexities of human relationships and human
frailties, because they have not looked deeply into the dark
recesses of their own hearts.
</P>
<P>
   These are the simple men, the black-or-white men, the
self-righteous men. And the world is beyond them. But they had the
money and political clout to drag a proud political party into its
saddest hour.
</P>
<P>
   When this impeachment process has finally run its course, we may
find that it becomes a watershed for the Republican Party. The GOP
may be forced to shake off its self-righteous wing, or face the
consequences dealt out by voters who are tired of being preached at
by those they elect to grapple with real problems the nation faces.
</P>
<P>
   This impeachment isn't a morality play, it's a third-rate soap
opera.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   For travelers in 1999, the watchword is ``buyer beware.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People out there are getting suckered every day,'' James
Ashurst of the American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA) says.
</P>
<P>
   In part, Ashurst claims, this is because con artists seem to be
getting smarter, or at least more technologically savvy. In
addition to the mail and the telephone, the Internet looms larger
than ever as the preferred breeding ground for fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ASTA now convenes an annual conference on travel fraud, which
they say is a $12 billion-a-year problem.
</P>
<P>
   According to ASTA, over the past few years, thousands of people
have been duped by a quick-and-easy offer to become a travel agent.
</P>
<P>
   For an amount ranging from $500 to several thousand dollars,
consumers receive a package containing a training kit and an ID
card and agree to sell similar packages to other consumers for a
portion of their earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The temptation is the promised opportunity to travel as a travel
agent, at substantially reduced rates. But like a classic pyramid
scheme, the result is usually a handful of people who make a great
deal of money and everyone else is the poorer for getting involved.
</P>
<P>
   As for the ``free trips,'' which motivate so many people to sign
on, airlines, hotels and other travel suppliers are aware of fake
travel agent IDs, and they rarely honor them.
</P>
<P>
   Vacation certificates are another continuing scam these days.
Whether mailed, faxed or sent via e-mail, they all promise the same
thing: a great vacation at a bargain-basement price.
</P>
<P>
   But they invariably require substantial additional fees to
redeem the certificates. Invariably, people pay more for their
vacations than if they had bought the packages through conventional
travel operators.
</P>
<P>
   Free air tickets, typically to places such as Hawaii and the
Caribbean, continue to be a prime temptation, too. But as everyone
should know, there is no free lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The usual catch is that the tickets have to be purchased from a
specified travel agency in conjunction with hotel or condo
accommodations, at prices so high they cover the agency's cost of
the ``free'' tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Win a dream vacation'' is another siren song to be wary of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some offers are above board,'' Ashurst of ASTA says, but he
cautions that many of the entry forms that can be found in
restaurant lobbies or received via the mail or e-mail ``are just an
opportunity for someone to call and pitch you a time-share vacation
or sell you a cruise. When you get there, what you get is a
refurbished auto ferry.''
</P>
<P>
   Shady contests have received a new lease on life on the
Internet. For example, a consumer might receive an unsolicited
e-mail saying they've won a $2,500 vacation for two. But to
collect, they owe the contest sponsor $395.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, no specific departure dates are given, only the
promise that they can vacation anytime within the next 18 months.
They pay the sponsor the money, but every time they try to book the
trip, the operators just can't seem to accommodate them, and 18
months later they're out of time _ and $395.
</P>
<P>
   So how does a consumer distinguish a scam from a great deal?
</P>
<P>
   1. Watch out for travel offers that say ``You have been chosen''
or ``specially selected.'' If they use the phrase ``you have been
awarded a vacation,'' it's almost certain that no such thing has
occurred _ nor will it.
</P>
<P>
   2. Should anyone insist on instant action, reject the offer.
What's good today should be good tomorrow _ and next week as well.
And anyone who promises a vacation 60 days or more down the road is
suspect, because that two-month window is typically the one that
credit-card companies allow to dispute a charge.
</P>
<P>
   3. Be wary of firms that use the term ``registration fee'' or
expressly require money to pay for certain charges in advance.
</P>
<P>
   4. Consumers cannot be made to pay for something they have
allegedly won. A credit card or check is needed only to pay for
services, not for identification.
</P>
<P>
   5. Any traveler who's offered a cheap trip should do a little
comparison shopping. If it's a ``Hawaiian vacation,'' see what a
round-trip ticket and a seven-night hotel stay in Hawaii really
costs. Call the hotel, check it out on the Internet or speak to a
travel agent.
</P>
<P>
   And remember, the term ``luxury'' is subjective. Just because a
property is located in Hawaii, the Caribbean or the Bahamas doesn't
mean that it's on a beach. Or anywhere near one.
</P>
<P>
   6. Work only with a bona-fide travel agent, preferably one who's
a member of ASTA (1101 King St., Alexandria, Va. 22314;
800-965-ASTA; www.astanet.com)
</P>
<P>
   7. Search for advertisers on the Internet and in the Yellow
Pages that carry the seal of the Better Business Bureau (BBB). It
means that they have been in business for at least one year, have
not engaged in unscrupulous advertising and will commit to binding
arbitration in the event of a dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Or contact the local chapter of the BBB by phone or via the Web
(www.bbb.org).
</P>
<P>
   Remember, if a deal sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

on, airlines, hotels and other travel suppliers are aware of fake
travel agent IDs, and they rarely honor them.
</P>
<P>
   Vacation certificates are another continuing scam these days.
Whether mailed, faxed or sent via e-mail, they all promise the same
thing: a great vacation at a bargain-basement price.
</P>
<P>
   But they invariably require substantial additional fees to
redeem the certificates. Invariably, people pay more for their
vacations than if they had bought the packages through conventional
travel operators.
</P>
<P>
   Free air tickets, typically to places such as Hawaii and the
Caribbean, continue to be a prime temptation, too. But as everyone
should know, there is no free lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The usual catch is that the tickets have to be purchased from a
specified travel agency in conjunction with hotel or condo
accommodations, at prices so high they cover the agency's cost of
the ``free'' tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Win a dream vacation'' is another siren song to be wary of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some offers are above board,'' Ashurst of ASTA says, but he
cautions that many of the entry forms that can be found in
restaurant lobbies or received via the mail or e-mail ``are just an
opportunity for someone to call and pitch you a time-share vacation
or sell you a cruise. When you get there, what you get is a
refurbished auto ferry.''
</P>
<P>
   Shady contests have received a new lease on life on the
Internet. For example, a consumer might receive an unsolicited
e-mail saying they've won a $2,500 vacation for two. But to
collect, they owe the contest sponsor $395.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, no specific departure dates are given, only the
promise that they can vacation anytime within the next 18 months.
They pay the sponsor the money, but every time they try to book the
trip, the operators just can't seem to accommodate them, and 18
months later they're out of time _ and $395.
</P>
<P>
   So how does a consumer distinguish a scam from a great deal?
</P>
<P>
   1. Watch out for travel offers that say ``You have been chosen''
or ``specially selected.'' If they use the phrase ``you have been
awarded a vacation,'' it's almost certain that no such thing has
occurred _ nor will it.
</P>
<P>
   2. Should anyone insist on instant action, reject the offer.
What's good today should be good tomorrow _ and next week as well.
And anyone who promises a vacation 60 days or more down the road is
suspect, because that two-month window is typically the one that
credit-card companies allow to dispute a charge.
</P>
<P>
   3. Be wary of firms that use the term ``registration fee'' or
expressly require money to pay for certain charges in advance.
</P>
<P>
   4. Consumers cannot be made to pay for something they have
allegedly won. A credit card or check is needed only to pay for
services, not for identification.
</P>
<P>
   5. Any traveler who's offered a cheap trip should do a little
comparison shopping. If it's a ``Hawaiian vacation,'' see what a
round-trip ticket and a seven-night hotel stay in Hawaii really
costs. Call the hotel, check it out on the Internet or speak to a
travel agent.
</P>
<P>
   And remember, the term ``luxury'' is subjective. Just because a
property is located in Hawaii, the Caribbean or the Bahamas doesn't
mean that it's on a beach. Or anywhere near one.
</P>
<P>
   6. Work only with a bona-fide travel agent, preferably one who's
a member of ASTA (1101 King St., Alexandria, Va. 22314;
800-965-ASTA; www.astanet.com)
</P>
<P>
   7. Search for advertisers on the Internet and in the Yellow
Pages that carry the seal of the Better Business Bureau (BBB). It
means that they have been in business for at least one year, have
not engaged in unscrupulous advertising and will commit to binding
arbitration in the event of a dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Or contact the local chapter of the BBB by phone or via the Web
(www.bbb.org).
</P>
<P>
   Remember, if a deal sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

CALIFORNIA TO RECEIVE MILLIONS FOR MILITARY CONSTRUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon is seeking $296.8 million for new
military construction projects in California for the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1, according to the Clinton administration's budget
proposal released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The overall figure represents a $75.3 million increase over the
current year's military construction budget for the state. Only
Hawaii _ at $324.6 million _ would receive more military
construction money.
</P>
<P>
   The sum includes $58 million to replace 339 family housing units
at Edwards Air Force Base, Beale Air Force Base and Vandenburg Air
Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   Other California projects include $13.6 million to replace a
medical and dental clinic at Los Angeles Air Force Base, $21.5
million to upgrade bachelor enlisted quarters at the San Diego
Naval Hospital and $54.4 million for a berthing wharf at the Navy's
San Clemente facility.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's request must be reviewed and approved by
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The total military construction budget for the new fiscal year
is $8.5 billion.

   Great events turn unfamiliar words into household terms. Like a
fish named the remora, or suckfish, which attaches itself to a
whale and goes along for the exciting ride, the language maven
latches on to the imposing subject and nibbles on the nourishing
usages churned up in its wake.
</P>
<P>
   Every schoolchild now knows the meaning of  &UR; impeach &LR; : ``to
charge with misconduct,'' or more generally, ``to cast doubt on.''
A few even know the Latin derivation, from  &UR; impedicare &LR; , ``to
fetter, to fix shackles on the feet; to hinder.'' The root is
 &UR; ped &LR; , ``foot,'' also the origin of  &UR; impede &LR;  and  &UR; impediment &LR; .
Mnemonic: The first step on the road to  &UR; impeachment &LR;  is putting
your  &UR; foot &LR;  in your mouth under oath.
</P>
<P>
   But less familiar words are churned up as well. Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan regaled reporters in the Capitol corridors with a
reading of The Federalist No. 67, by Alexander Hamilton. This
framer, a believer in ``energy in the executive,'' derided worries
about a too-powerful president and included this line: ``We have
been taught to tremble at the terrific visages of murdering
 &UR; janizaries &LR; , and to blush at the unveiled mysteries of a future
 &UR; seraglio &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   The  &UR; janizaries &LR;  were elite Turkish troops; the word now means
``close aides, loyal supporters''; FDR's ``brain trust'' was mocked
by Republicans as ``the  &UR; janizariat &LR; .''  &UR; Seraglio &LR; , spelled with
two  &UR; r &LR; 's in Italian, originally meant ``Turkish palace'' but came
to mean ``harem.'' Edward Gibbon wrote in his 1776 ``Decline and
Fall of the Roman Empire'' that the Emperor Commodus spent his
hours ``in a  &UR; seraglio &LR;  of 300 beautiful women.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton was exaggerating the fears of a monarchic presidency,
and Moynihan was deriding the interest in Oval Office goings-on as
the salacious search for a harem, or  &UR; seraglio &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Another Italian word,  &UR; imbroglio &LR; , ``a confused entanglement,''
was used by editors of The New Republic in a portmanteau coinage.
The magazine took  &UR; bimbo &LR; , Italian for ``baby,'' and in English,
``ditzy dame,'' and combined it with  &UR; imbroglio &LR;  to form
 &UR; bimbroglio &LR; , a description of the complicated mess President
Clinton got himself into. The coinage didn't catch on, but the
editors grimly stuck with it.
</P>
<P>
   The New Republic ran a fine article by Walter Shapiro, a
columnist for USA Today, about the way liberals have stuck with
Clinton, which included the line ``Democrats were pantingly eager
to excuse the president's  &UR; latitudinarian &LR;  campaign tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the free-thinking Shapiro make an adverb out of the
participle  &UR; panting &LR; , thereby providing an intensified form of
 &UR; eagerly &LR; , but he also was first on the pundit's block to use
 &UR; latitudinarian &LR; , ``liberal or broad-minded in standards of conduct
or religious belief.'' (No, the opposite is not  &UR; longitudinarian &LR; ;
the antonym is ``like a hidebound stiff.'')
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Rogan, one of the most articulate impeachment
managers, used a word familiar to bashers of textual deviates:
``Ms. Lewinsky doesn't bother attempting to match the president's
linguistic  &UR; deconstructions &LR;  of the English language.''
</P>
<P>
   Who says the Republicans don't read Jacques Derrida or go to
Woody Allen films?  &UR; Deconstruction &LR;  is a philosophy that challenges
the ability of language to represent reality. It holds that a
reader is free to find meaning in a text that the writer did not
intend, and _ in making the interpreter a partner in the creation
of copy _ seeks to replace the stability of logic with the fluidity
of paradox.
</P>
<P>
   Derrida's late-'60s anti-theory theory, despised by orderly
structuralists, has led to much scholarly wordplay and
interdisciplinary whipping.
</P>
<P>
   As used by impeachment managers,  &UR; deconstruction &LR;  means
``Humpty-Dumpty language,'' taken from Lewis Carroll's line in
``Through the Looking-Glass'': ``When I use a word ... it means
just what I choose it to mean _ neither more nor less.'' (Woody
Allen, in the title of his 1997 `` &UR; Deconstructing &LR;  Harry,'' used
the word in its literal sense, to mean ``taking apart,'' I think,
but  &UR; deconstructionists &LR;  are free to read into his title anything
they want and the dickens with the auteur.)
</P>
<P>
   A word with a relatively fixed meaning was used by Sen. Tom
Harkin of Iowa, who denounced the House case as ``counterfeit'' and
``a sham,'' adding for emphasis on national television, ``a pile of
 &UR; dung &LR; .'' The word was front-paged by The Washington Post and
A-elevened by The New York Times. It is evidently a socially
acceptable word that the OED defines as ``excrementitious and
decayed matter employed to fertilize the soil; manure.''
</P>
<P>
   First spotted at the beginning of the millennium in a
Latin-to-Anglo-Saxon glossary under the heading ``Concerning Tools
of Farmers,'' it is now ``a term of obloquy.'' In some translations
of the Book of Job, the suffering protagonist is described as
seated on a  &UR; dunghill &LR; . Harland Braun, a Los Angeles criminal
defense lawyer, told a Times reporter what he thought of the O.J.
Simpson case in 1996: ``You can't make a chicken salad out of
chicken  &UR; dung &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Harkin's barnyard characterization of the case
recalled a similar usage by the snake-checking Al Haig at the
Republican convention in 1988. He compared the Democratic
leadership to a bat, ``flying erratically for brief periods at low
levels and hanging upside down for extended periods in dark, damp
caves up to its navel in  &UR; guano &LR; .'' That is the Spanish word for
seafowl dung.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Obloquy &LR; , used above to define  &UR; dung &LR; , was used by the lead
manager, Henry Hyde. From the Latin meaning ``speak against,'' the
noun is less abusive than  &UR; calumny &LR;  or  &UR; slander &LR;  but much stronger
than  &UR; blame &LR;  or  &UR; criticism &LR; . The original sense of  &UR; obloquy &LR;  was
``evil-speaking,'' but the current sense is the result of all the
defamation, vituperation and invective:  &UR; disgrace &LR; . The philosophic
view:  &UR; Dung &LR;  happens.

TEXANS COULD USE COURSE ON JUDICIAL SYSTEM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Public opinion polls are more prevalent than
gushing noses during Austin's cedar fever season, and still another
survey was released last week.
</P>
<P>
   This one indicates that most Texans think highly of judges but _
as we already knew _ have some pretty strong doubts about
journalists, politicians, auto mechanics and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted by the University of North Texas in
cooperation with the State Bar and the Texas Office of Court
Administration, is part of a campaign to boost the public image of
the courts and the legal profession.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, though, the poll will probably slam the door _ once
again _ on any legislative effort to replace Texas' money-driven,
partisan judicial election system, which many critics believe is a
blight on the courts, the legal profession and state government in
general.
</P>
<P>
   The poll shows that the vast majority of Texans _ 70 percent _
want to keep electing their judges. Only 20 percent favor the
alternative, promoted for years by would-be reformers, that judges
be appointed by the governor and keep their offices in periodic
retention elections.
</P>
<P>
   The finding, which reaffirms earlier, similar surveys, will
solidify some already pretty strong legislative opposition to
changing the judicial selection system.
</P>
<P>
   Several previous efforts have failed, and Gov. George W. Bush
also is a strong supporter of electing judges.
</P>
<P>
   The survey doesn't differentiate between partisan and
nonpartisan elections, which also have been suggested as a possible
reform, but that distinction won't matter in the legislative
debate.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also shows that most Texans believe there aren't enough
female and minority judges and most believe campaign contributions
influence courtroom decisions _ two problems often blamed on the
partisan election system _ but voters still want to elect judges.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Supreme Court Justice Greg Abbott _ who, like his
colleagues on the high court, has advocated an
appointment-retention system for selecting appellate judges _ said
the Legislature should scrap the elective system anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers, he said, should ``take a leadership role and not just
follow polls.''
</P>
<P>
   More leaders, however, would be easier to find if the poll
weren't so lopsided.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott and the other Supreme Court justices, instead, can
console themselves with warm assurances that 71 percent of the
poll's respondents consider all judges honest and ethical and that
77 percent put members of the Supreme Court in that category.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if anyone thinks those high marks are inconsistent with
another finding in the same survey that 83 percent of Texans
believe that judges' decisions are influenced by campaign
contributions, I wouldn't argue.
</P>
<P>
   Several survey results, in fact, seem inconsistent. Or, perhaps,
they simply reflect a low level of public knowledge about what
lawyers and judges do.
</P>
<P>
   For example:
</P>
<P>
   _ Why do so many Texans consider judges honest and ethical but
only 40 percent, as the survey indicates, put lawyers, as a class,
in that category? Except for some justices of the peace, judges
were trained as lawyers and most practiced law before they assumed
the bench.
</P>
<P>
   As Walt Borges, a consumer watchdog, pointed out, ``People don't
change just because they put on a robe.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Many people have long considered lawyers a money-grubbing lot,
a perception that has been strengthened in recent years by civil
justice reformers' attacks on plaintiffs' lawyers and high legal
fees. But despite their opinions of lawyers' ethics, 77 percent of
the poll's respondents believed that lawyers are competent.
</P>
<P>
   _ While the vast majority of poll respondents had a high opinion
of judges' ethics, only 26 percent considered politicians ethical.
As long as judges are elected in Texas, however, they have to be
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   _ Half of the respondents thought that a criminal defendant has
to prove his or her innocence, despite Americans' long-standing
right to a presumption of innocence. The governor is right. There
have been too many social promotions in Texas' public schools.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, there is one other major inconsistency that wasn't
covered in the poll but is directly related to it. Although they
want to keep electing their state judges, the vast majority of
Texans, especially in the cities, don't have the slightest idea who
their judges are, much less how competent _ or ethical _ they are.

HOT PATIO NEEDS AIR, HEAT-TOLERANT PLANTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: My open-air patio is 12 feet by 16 feet, has a concrete floor
with a drain, and narrow 11-inch flower beds surround three sides.
The north side is the back of my two-story home; the east is a
6-foot-high brick wall, and the south side is the brick wall of my
garage. The west side is also a bricked wall, but has no bed. The
only circulation comes from west-end doors to the garage and into
my townhome. During the summer the temperatures are unforgiving.
Most of it gets sun until midafternoon in the warm months.
</P>
<P>
   To date, only green and variegated airplane plants, Confederate
jasmine growing up the north wall and Carolina jessamine on the
south side have lived and actually thrived. Soil tests show the
soil contains an excess of phosphorus, which may be causing iron
and zinc deficiencies. I have been advised to avoid future
phosphorus applications and apply limestone and possibly iron and
zinc.
</P>
<P>
   Can I plant immediately after adding the minerals? Can you
recommend any flowering plants that would be candidates for these
conditions? When is the best time to prune the jasmine/jessamine?
The Confederates take over everything.
</P>
<P>
   A: If possible, use a fan to improve air circulation. The tall
ones found at hardware/home stores these days are fairly
attractive. It would make your time outdoors during hot weather
more enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   I like to wait a while after amending the soil before I plant.
Give the earth a little time to settle. It's true that our soils
often have an abundance of phosphorus, but without realizing that
this abundance is simply tied up in the soil, we add more to
encourage flowering plants to produce at maximum levels. Lime makes
a soil more alkaline; sulfur makes it more acidic. Some plants
prefer one over the other, but generally a neutral soil is good for
a wide range of plants.
</P>
<P>
   Given an organically enriched, well-draining soil and improved
air circulation, plants that usually tolerate summer temperatures
and at least a half day of sun include angelonia, a tender
perennial that produces a profusion of purple flowers; `David
Verity' cuphea, a dwarf cigar plant; mildew-resistant, mounding
Mexican zinnias (Zinnia linearis), available in crisp white or
tangerine; purple or pink globe amaranth (gomphrena);
butterfly-attracting pentas; portulaca; newer varie- ties of
periwinkle; and the tall, wispy spider flowers (Cleome).
</P>
<P>
   You can add interest with plants grown for their
colorful/textural foliage: `Solar Sunrise' coleus, the more
sun-tolerant caladiums and the many succulent sedums.
</P>
<P>
   I would consider adding a large container _ perhaps a cobalt
blue pot containing yellow bells (Tecoma stans), a prolific bloomer
that flowers from spring until frost.
</P>
<P>
   Prune your vines after they have bloomed. You can snip them back
during the growing season as well.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Bradford pear in my front yard has roots that spread out
into the lawn and spoils the appearance. If I cut those roots, will
it kill the tree?
</P>
<P>
   A: You could remove a few minor roots over a period of time, and
with some trees, it is possible to remove one large root per year.
But I would suggest talking to an arborist before attempting to cut
anything major.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a corn stalk plant about 7 feet tall that I have had
for several years. I've kept it in the house under a skylight. For
the past month the bottom leaves turn brown and die. Every week I
cut those off. I usually water once a week. Any advice?
</P>
<P>
   A: When lower leaves darken and appear to be rotting,
overwatering is often the problem. If the lower leaves are drying
up, then it could be a matter of too much heat, too little light or
too little water. You'll need to do a cultural check.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that a tree stretching over the skylight has shed
leaves, therefore allowing in more sun and heat? Assuming the light
is still adequate after all these years, does the plant sit too
near a heat register?
</P>
<P>
   It seems weekly watering would be sufficient, especially in
winter, but if the temperature has been higher, then the soil may
be drying more quickly. Check soil moisture before watering next
week. If it is dry deep in the pot, water. But do not let the plant
sit in a saucer of drainage water for too long. If the soil is
moist just below the surface, hold off on watering.
</P>
<P>
   The corn plant likes high humidity. Increase, if necessary, by
standing the pot on pebbles in a tray of water. Your plant might
also benefit from repotting.

FREDERICK SOMMER HAD HIS OWN FRAME OF REFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Frederick Sommer was a thin, frail man with an Old
World elegance who enjoyed mystifying his audience.
</P>
<P>
   The artist, who died last week at 93, lived down a narrow side
street in Prescott in a tiny wooden house he shared with his wife
of 70 years and the floor-to-ceiling shelves filled with his books.
</P>
<P>
   He would sit like a spindly Buddha in his corner chair and say
astonishing things:
</P>
<P>
   ``The unknown is the most friendly thing in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Or: ``Our fundamental empathy is to the structure that content
reveals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fred was Prescott's own guru,'' recalls ``Arizona Republic''
</P>
<P>
   photographer Christine Keith, who was friends with Sommer. ``If
you felt like talking aesthetics, you could always go over and
knock on his door, and if you brought a pint of ice cream, he'd let
you in.''
</P>
<P>
   Weston Naef, who is curator of photography at the J. Paul Getty
Museum in Los Angeles, remembers meeting Sommer for the first time:
</P>
<P>
   ``I first met Sommer about 30 years ago at a gallery show in New
York. And my first impression _ I was a much younger man _ was that
he was a formidable and inscrutable person, whose own persona was
projected not only through his photographs, but also through a
stream of rather philosophical conversation that was not always
completely comprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   ``As 30 years passed, and we reunited to work on the show we
mounted at the Getty in 1994, my experience was 180 degrees from
the first meeting. Everything was totally comprehensible. Had the
passing of years made me a wiser person, or had he become a softer,
gentler, more communicative person? Probably both of those
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Naef wound up negotiating the purchase of 100 of Sommer's prints
for his museum, making it the largest and most representative
collection of Sommer's art outside Sommer's Prescott home.
</P>
<P>
   And (begin ital) that (end ital) collection _ Sommer's own
prints, negatives and notebooks _ will now find its way to Tucson's
Center for Creative Photography as part of its Sommer archive.
</P>
<P>
   His photographs are spare and enigmatic, and although they are
printed with great beauty, the images themselves are as far from
pretty as Timbuktu is from Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his better known are of butchered chicken parts; dead,
skinned coyotes; and Arizona landscapes with no discernible subject
and no horizon. He has created photographic negatives from candle
soot deposited on glass, and reconstructed children's dolls out of
mismatched body parts.
</P>
<P>
   Sommer was a strict believer in high art. He was not a
pop-culture kind of guy. He was one of the last surviving members
of a group of photographers who strove in the first half of this
century to make photography accepted as a fine-art medium. His
friends and acquaintances included Edward Weston _ who stayed with
Sommer during Weston's famous Guggenheim trip in 1937 _ Alfred
Stieglitz and Paul Strand.
</P>
<P>
   But no one ever mistook Sommer for a warm and fuzzy type. He
developed something of a reputation as a recluse, living in
Prescott, far from the art world, and avoiding much human contact,
outside a close circle of friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost anybody who is sensitive and lives on a high level of
abstraction, like Fred, doesn't want to be bothered by curiosity
seekers,'' says Richard Landis, a Prescott artist and friend of
Sommer. ``He kept himself away from such people. But he had a guest
house there with several bedrooms right next door so that people he
wanted to see could visit. He was no hermit.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, to anyone invited in, no one could be friendlier than
Sommer. He was solicitous and curious, and seemed to long for
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, such talk was never about who's-doing-what or
whatever-happened-to. It was always talk about ideas. Ideas were
more comfortable to Sommer than any easy chair.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is why he has never been a popular artist. He
didn't photograph glorious landscapes, like Ansel Adams, or his dog
dressed up in a ball gown, like William Wegman. No, his art was
always about ideas, and those ideas were abstruse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He developed a personal vocabulary, like his `poetic logic,'
'' recalls Landis. ``It was strange. He would give a talk to a
visitor and he could baffle with his vocabulary. They could see the
enthusiasm and conviction, but couldn't quite tell what he meant.''
</P>
<P>
   But in part, that incomprehensibility was his means of
illustrating his central concern: the way the human mind creates
order and meaning from chaos. Humans cannot stand gibberish; they
look to discover what meaning might be hidden, creating metaphor
from rubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality of the world is complete, but our perception is
far from complete,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his best-known images, a blob of melted metal,
retrieved from a burned-out car, is superimposed on a Victorian
wood engraving to create a surreal Madonna and Child.
</P>
<P>
   The secret of this picture is that, although it is only a blob
of metal, we can't help but see it as a Madonna and Child. Our
brain forces us to make sense of what is essentially nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   That inbred rationality, which he called ``poetic logic,'' works
like a chemical agent on all the strange elements he chose to
present to us.
</P>
<P>
   For Sommer, what was most amazing wasn't the weirdness of the
human mind, but its orderliness. We will make sense, no matter what
the cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art is a pursuing of structure,'' he once said to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could take five pebbles, not necessarily pretty ones, just
ordinary pebbles, and toss them down and the way they land would
describe a structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Some pebbles would be closer to others, some farther away. The
artist must find the visual connections that tie the pebbles
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spend my time connecting things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The richness is much greater than if you just have a few
pretty stones lying around.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you increase the number from five to 300 pebbles?
</P>
<P>
   ``The richness is even greater, more sophisticated.''
</P>
<P>
   So Sommer sought to bring together in his drawings and
photographs images that initially seem random.
</P>
<P>
   ``The structure of images is found in the arrangement of our
minds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This drive even shows in the ordering of photographs in the book
``Frederick Sommer: Images and Words,'' published in 1984 by the
Center for Creative Photography.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Solomon is the center's director of publications and
public information. She worked with Sommer on the book.
</P>
<P>
   They tried several ways of sequencing the images that covered
his life's work, looking at them chronologically and thematically,
but none of the sequences worked to Sommer's satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he dumped them all together and pulled them out at
random,'' and formed the sequence the book now has.
</P>
<P>
   Many who knew him had the experience of listening to Sommer
``skip read.'' It was an uncanny performance. Skip reading, which
Sommer invented, calls for the reader to run his finger down a
page, picking up words at random and forming new _ and wonderfully
poetic _ sentences from the fragments.
</P>
<P>
   If I skip read the beginning of this story, I might come up with
something like:
</P>
<P>
   ``Frederick died like a thing in the world who was felt for the
first time.''
</P>
<P>
   It creates poetry from prose, art from chaff.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over, Sommer could pick a book and page at random and
spout what seemed like brilliant poetry. He would point out that
the poetry was entirely in the mind of the hearer.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of bright stones pebble the night sky and we make
constellations out of them. We structure the heavens with our
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a night sky shattered into shiny pinpoints, ancient
humans grouped them into comprehensible patterns _ constellations _
and created order where none existed.
</P>
<P>
   Sommer would scissor up the night sky and patch it together at
random so we might have the labor of reinventing the
constellations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The complications of a work of art are not problems, but
riches,'' Sommer said.
</P>
<P>
   And he is now a star in one of those constellations. &QL;

   Some time this month, E-rater is scheduled to begin grading the
two essay questions on the GMAT, which is taken by applicants to
business graduate schools. Using expert-system technology, essays
will be graded on the basis of their vocabulary, syntax and logic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a trial,'' said Frederic McHale of the Graduate
Management Admission Council, the Virginia group that sponsors the
GMAT. ``It's been thoroughly tested.''
</P>
<P>
   With college students and educators among the most computerized
demographic groups, it comes as little surprise that computers are
shaping the educational experience beyond the classroom. For a
growing number of students, the traditional wait in long lines at
the college bookstore has been replace by a process of surf and
click from the comfort of their dorm rooms. And for other students,
help cramming for exams is available online.
</P>
<P>
   Essay questions on past versions of the GMAT were graded by two
professors. If their answers were within one point of each other
then an average of the two becomes the final score. If their
answers are more than a point apart, then a third professor comes
in to be the deciding vote. The new system will use the e-rater in
place of one of the humans. If the human and computer scores are
within one point, then an average will be the final score, as it is
in the existing system. If they differ by more than a point, a
second professor will be brought in and the computer score will no
longer be considered.
</P>
<P>
   McHale said the system is designed to work in conjunction with
human check and balance. It is also designed to score answers to
specific questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about evaluating creative writing. We're not
planning to use the machines by themselves,'' he said. ``Some
individuals have a unique or creative way of writing that the
machine cannot understand.''
</P>
<P>
   E-rater begins with a sample of about 300 answers to each
question that have been previously graded by professors. The
questions include the full range of 1 to 6 possible points. E-rater
analyzes each answer on the basis of 57 features from three
categories, syntax, vocabulary and the logic or structure of its
argument and builds a sort of statistical profile of what makes up
each of the six possible scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks for syntactic structure, the structural information
about the sentence,'' ETS developmental scientist Jill Burstein
said. ``It looks for vocabulary. And it looks for discourse, cue
words and terms related to argument structure.''
</P>
<P>
   E-rater then runs the same analysis of the 57 features on each
essay answer and compares the profile of that essay against the six
profiles of possible scores from the sample essays.
</P>
<P>
   The computer score agreed with the human score from 87 to 94
percent of the time, which is identical to the agreement rate
between two people, McHale said.
</P>
<P>
   Computers are changing another facet of college life at the
University of Arizona and dozens of other large universities across
the country. Students can sign on to the Web site VarsityBooks.com,
select their school from a list, then select their major from a
second list and then select the required books for their classes
from a third list. Texts are listed by class number and
instructor's name. In a few days, the selected books will arrive in
the mail.
</P>
<P>
   VarsityBooks.com includes the University of Arizona as one of 57
major U.S. schools where required books can be selected by
professor name and class number. Company founder Eric Kuhn says
plans call for inclusion of Arizona State University book lists by
the fall semester.
</P>
<P>
   Students from schools not yet included can still shop with the
company, but will have to go through a couple of extra steps to
search for the books by title.
</P>
<P>
   Kuhn, who gave up a job as a corporate attorney to found
VarsityBooks.com in December 1997, said that inefficient industries
such as the college bookstore are fertile ground for Internet
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an ideal opportunity,'' he said. ``It's a $3 billion
niche market.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the attractions is that 95 percent of college students
are online, more than any other demographic group. They're
comfortable with the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   When the e-marketer launched, it had only five featured schools
in the Washington, D.C., market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a week, we were selling to students in all 50 states.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuhn said that the reduced overhead of e-commerce allows
VarsityBooks.com to offer significant discounts over the college
book stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've operated much like a monopoly for years,'' he said.
``This has not traditionally been a competitive area.''
</P>
<P>
   He said some college bookstores have launched their own online
stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their response has been interesting,'' Kuhn said. ``I think
that most view us as inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet also offers several sites to help students, for a
fee.
</P>
<P>
   One such site, cram.com, offers notes, study aids called cram
sheets and cheat sheets.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Tutor Co. announced (www.supertutor.com) offers a site
targeting high school and middle school students. The company's
final-exam prep site, the Cram Zone (www.homeworkhelp.com), was
launched in May. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Two cowboys talk about the devil in the Burt Lancaster
Western ``Ulzana's Raid.'' One explains, ``He said if he owned hell
and Arizona, he'd live in hell and rent out Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   That's only the beginning of what Hollywood pictures have to say
about Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Movie Manhattan is full of witty sophisticates loving and
losing, while cinematic Beverly Hills symbolizes shallow wealth
drowning in glitz. Arizona, meanwhile, has a bit of an identity
crisis, as far as filmmakers go:
</P>
<P>
   From ``Smoke Signals'':
</P>
<P>
   ``Mars, Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   What a young Native American (Adam Beach) calls the desert
outskirts of Phoenix when he has to walk through the desert.
</P>
<P>
   From ``The Wedding Singer'':
</P>
<P>
   Adam Sandler explains how he knew his fiancee wasn't the right
one for him. ``We were flying to the Grand Canyon once, and I
hadn't been there and Linda had and you would think she'd have
given me the window seat. But she didn't. I don't know. It's a
little thing.''
</P>
<P>
   From ``Jerry Maguire'':
</P>
<P>
   The Tom Cruise romancer contains two psychic plot points:
</P>
<P>
   1. The Arizona Cardinals make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   2. They beat the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   From ``My Fellow Americans'':
</P>
<P>
   James Garner, as an ex-president, discounts an attempt made on
his life in Arizona because the woman ``used a starter pistol.''
</P>
<P>
   From ``L.A. Confidential'':
</P>
<P>
   Kim Basinger plays a high-price call girl from Arizona who has a
pillow on her bed with a map of the state on it.
</P>
<P>
   Her dream: to make enough money to return to Bisbee, where she
grew up, and open a dress shop because ``the girls in Bisbee need a
little glamour.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Basinger says to a successful politician, ``Some men get
the world. Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we could make that our new state motto.
</P>
<P>
   From ``In the Company of Men'':
</P>
<P>
   A cruel business executive explains that when younger hotshots
take over the company, the losers will be sent into oblivion or, as
he puts it, ``the Phoenix office.''
</P>
<P>
   From ``Nothing to Lose'':
</P>
<P>
   An Arizona sheriff searches for the bad guys, who are somewhere
out in the desert. He tells his deputy, ``If there's so much as a
sneeze out there, I want to feel the mist.''
</P>
<P>
   From ``That Old Feeling'':
</P>
<P>
   Old flame Dennis Farina disapproves of Bette Midler's flamboyant
new hairstyle, saying, ``Your hair looks perfect _ for a madam in a
saloon in Tucson.''
</P>
<P>
   From ``Fools Rush In'':
</P>
<P>
   An Eastern WASP broiling in the Arizona summer says, ``White
people can melt out here.''
</P>
<P>
   From ``I'm Not Rappaport'':
</P>
<P>
   Oldsters Walter Matthau and Ossie Davis try to scare a NYC drug
dealer by telling him they're mob bosses from Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Is that as tough as our hoods get? Mobsters with walkers?
</P>
<P>
   From ``The Truth About Cats and Dogs'':
</P>
<P>
   Janeane Garofalo and Uma Thurman test Ben Chaplin's romantic
affections by posing this dilemma to him: ``If you were stranded in
that bubble thing in Arizona, who would you take with you: ``Time''
magazine's Woman of the Year or ``Playboy's'' Playmate of the
Year?''
</P>
<P>
   From ``Practical Magic'':
</P>
<P>
   Aidan Quinn, playing a cop from Tucson, impresses Sandra
Bullock's daughters by fixing saguaro-shape pancakes.
</P>
<P>
   From ``Twilight'':
</P>
<P>
   Liev Schreiber, an ex-con who served time in a Yuma prison,
says, ``If you want to learn to kick ass, there's no better place
than Yuma.''
</P>
<P>
   From ``Paulie'':
</P>
<P>
   In this kids' movie, a talking parrot explains that ``if you see
a sunrise at the Grand Canyon, it's like seeing the first sunrise
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   From ``Deep Impact'':
</P>
<P>
   This asteroid-hits-the-Earth thriller implies that Arizonans are
really bad drivers.
</P>
<P>
   In an early scene, an Arizona astronomer drives wildly down a
mountain road at night, while a nitwit Arizona truck driver drives
up the road.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man looks where he's going. They crash. The astronomer
dies. Oddly, the scene has absolutely nothing to do with the rest
of the movie. &QL;

TOP WEB SITES? DEPENDS ON THE CHOOSER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HOYE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Well, we're a month into the new year, and the
computer press is winding up its look back on the top Web sites of
1998. &QL; 
In checking out some of the lists of top sites, I found it
interesting to note that being a top site in terms of the number of
visitors attracted doesn't necessarily make for a top site in terms
of quality.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the lists of top Web sites published by
``Yahoo! Internet Life'' and ``PC Magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   According to ``Yahoo! Internet Life,'' which rated Web sites
based on number of visitors, the top three online news sites were
CNN.com (www.cnn.com), MSNBC.com (www.msnbc.com) and USA Today
(www.usatoday.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``PC Magazine,'' meanwhile, created its list of top sites based
on the expertise of its staff members.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are our essential bookmarks,'' Don Willmott wrote in the
Feb. 9 issue of ``PC Magazine.'' They are ``sites that we find
ourselves returning to again and again for their ease of
navigation, design, content and, most important of all, their
usefulness.''
</P>
<P>
   When it came to online news sites, ``PC Magazine'' also listed
CNN.com and MSNBC.com among its top picks. But ``USA Today'' was
not on the list. Instead, ``PC Magazine'' mentioned ABCNEWS.com
(www.abcnews.com), the Associated Press news service, the Wire
(www.wire.ap.org), and the ``NewYork Times'' (www.nytimes.com).
</P>
<P>
   In describing the Wire, ``PC Magazine'' noted, ``No nonsense
here. The Wire is your most direct access to current news stories
and photographs coming across the Associated Press wire . . . for
some kinds of news, this is as close to the source as you can
get.''
</P>
<P>
   Another interesting top Web site category to compare was online
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yahoo! Internet Life'' listed the top sites as Disney
(www.disney.com), Sony (www.sony.com) and the Internet Movie
Database (www.imdb.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``PC Magazine'' agreed on just one of those choices: The
Internet Movie Database. Instead of Disney and Sony, its top
entertainment sites included Broadcast.com (www.broadcast.com),
which provides live radio broadcasts, MP3.com (www.mp3.com), which
offers information and downloadable music in the new MP3 format,
Mylaunch (www.mylaunch.com), a customizable site for music lovers,
and the Onion (www.theonion.com), a bawdy adult humor site.
</P>
<P>
   Something else I noted was that ``Yahoo! Internet Life'' ranked
Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com) as the top Web site based on the number of
visits it gets.
</P>
<P>
   (I know, the magazine has a licensing agreement with the Web
site of the same name. But don't worry, I've seen Yahoo! listed as
the top Web site by other sources. And the magazine claims to be
``editorially independent'' from the Web site. For the record, both
``Yahoo! Internet Life'' and ``PC Magazine'' are owned by Ziff
Davis.)
</P>
<P>
   What's interesting is how ``PC Magazine'' listed Yahoo!.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``PC Magazine'' listed Yahoo! as one of its top portal,
or starting, pages on the Web, it didn't include Yahoo! as a top
search engine, which is how Yahoo! got its start.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, ``PC Magazine'' listed top search engines as AltaVista
(www.av.com), HotBot (www.hotbot.com), MetaCrawler
(www.metacrawler.com), Google! (www.google.stanford.edu.com), and
Northern Light (www.northernlight.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``PC Magazine'' did mention Yahoo! among the tops in three other
categories: Yahoo! Chat (chat.yahoo.com), Yahoo! Finance
(www.quote.yahoo.com), and the people-finder Yahoo! People
(www.people.yahoo.com).
</P>
<P>
   Although I still use Yahoo! often to find things, I have to
agree with ``PC Magazine's'' Yahoo!-less search engine list. In my
experience, I more often find what I am looking for by using either
HotBot or AltaVista.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
What's an old PC worth? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, you have a PC sitting in the unused bedroom. You bought it,
say, three years ago, and you spent, say, $2,800. Now you want to
sell it, figuring it's gotta still be worth about $500, maybe
$1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong-o, buddy boy! You'll be lucky if that old PC is still
worth $300. More likely, it's worth closer to $200!
</P>
<P>
   That's the lesson learned by anyone who has access to an Orion
Blue Book of Computers, one of 12 price manuals produced several
times a year by Orion Research Corp. in Scottsdale, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to computers, Orion produces Blue Books on cameras,
audio equipment, car stereos, copiers, guitars, guns, pianos, power
tools, televisions and other categories.
</P>
<P>
   Orion owner Roger Rohrs sent me the company's latest Blue Book
of Computers, which comes on a handy CD-ROM. It was both
interesting and painful to read!
</P>
<P>
   If you look at older computers, those sold in the early 1990s,
you can find many that sold for thousands of dollars but now are
worth $10, $20 or $30.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd like to check out Orion's Blue Books for yourself,
usually you've got to shell out a few hundred bucks to buy the
CD-ROM or a printed book.
</P>
<P>
   But for a limited time, Orion is offering a complete set of its
Blue Books _ including the computer pricing information _ on CD-ROM
for just $25. The catch: The CD-ROM and its data expire at the end
of this month.
</P>
<P>
   If you're interested in obtaining such a time-limited CD, or if
you want to buy a regular CD, visit Orion at www.bluebook.com. Or
you can call the company at (602) 951-1114. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Year 2000 humor &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a parting dose of humor, this week I offer a funny Y2K tidbit
that's been bouncing around the Internet via e-mail. I'm not sure
who wrote it, but it's worth a laugh:
</P>
<P>

DASTARDLY BUG DOWNSIDE OF DADHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - When you're a parent, you often think not of what you
give to your child, but what your child gives back to you:
unconditional love, trust, a sense of purpose, and every kind of
disgusting-fluid, body-aching, night-sweat sickness you can think
of.
</P>
<P>
   That's something you don't learn when reading up in how-to
guides on birthing techniques and diaper changes and whatnot. You
won't find a chapter titled, ``A Guide to Sharing Illness, or, You
Get What They Get, Only Much Worse.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems as if the whole Valley has the flu lately. Of course,
not everyone is catching it from kids. Shake a hand, open a door,
stand too close to a stranger's sneeze, and the next thing you
know, you are lying on the couch, delirious from fever, convinced
you remember why you thought that buying a time share in Florida
was ever a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   But there is something particularly cruel about catching it from
your own child. So far, the worst thing your little treasure has
done was cry during church or soil a diaper when your mother-in-law
was holding her. Now she has inadvertently landed you one step away
from a croup tent.
</P>
<P>
   You can't hold it against her, of course, but at the same time,
you can't help but wonder how many more times she will hurt you in
one way or another, purposely or not. It's probably too great a
leap to go from her giving you a cold to imagining her dating a
juvenile delinquent with multiple body piercings just to drive you
crazy. But strong-enough cough medicine will do that. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Deflating experience
</P>
<P>
   Of course, illness is no picnic for the kid, either. And you are
unselfish. No matter how crummy you feel, your first priority is
getting your child healthy again.
</P>
<P>
   A sick child is a sad thing indeed. Normally, my daughter spends
her time laughing, pulling hair and, if you get close enough,
biting your nose with a pair of surprisingly sharp teeth.
</P>
<P>
   But the first time she ran a high fever, she just sat there,
looking like a balloon someone had let most of the air out of. None
of the usual tricks worked _ tickling her bellybutton, making
squeaking noises, letting her play with Earl E. Bird (a
stuffed-animal favorite), nothing.
</P>
<P>
   We tried small doses of children's Tylenol _ normally the
impetus for a major battle. But not now. Listlessly, she swallowed
the medicine. She simply had no fight left in her. That deflated
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   We called the pediatrician, of course. If you are a first-time
parent, you call the pediatrician every time the baby cries, stops
crying, eats too little, eats too much, snores, laughs or does
anything other than lie quietly and look vaguely happy. Sometimes
then, too.
</P>
<P>
   Once you get the professional word that all you can really do is
wait it out (although a little bubble-gum-flavored medicine may be
involved), you begin to think about yourself. At some level, you
know that to care for your child properly, you need to feel better
yourself. &QL; 
No time for soaps
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet any attention you pay to your own illness is accompanied by
guilt. How dare you worry about your own health _ you've got a sick
kid to think about!
</P>
<P>
   It's a whole new lesson in selfless behavior. Alone, you would
call in sick, bury yourself under mounds of blankets and lie on the
couch, watching afternoon soaps while awash in a sea of
decongestants.
</P>
<P>
   But now there are diapers to be changed, bottles to be washed,
burps to be coaxed. You may feel like a truck has run over you, but
you no longer have time to worry about it. Self-pity isn't an
option when you're out of Wet Ones, no matter how bloated your head
may feel. Parenthood doesn't include sick days.
</P>
<P>
   A child's illness _ and the inevitability of your accompanying
one _ moves you beyond the isn't-she-cute, unqualified joy of
having a child to the down-and-dirty reminder that you have signed
on for the good times and the bad. You're part of something bigger
now; someone depends on you. For everything.
</P>
<P>
   And as long as everyone recovers, it's almost a little gift. No
one likes to be sick. But everyone likes to be needed. &QL;

SOUTH AFRICA KILLING REIGNITES FEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, South Africa _ In his youth, Sifiso Nkabinde wasn't
skillful on the soccer field. But his peers let him play anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came from a rich family, so he bought the ball,'' said
Matthew Ngubane, a former schoolmate. ``And he was kind of a
bully.''
</P>
<P>
   A rich bully he lived, a rich bully he died. Saturday, a week
after he was killed in a spray of automatic gunfire outside the
town grocery, Nkabinde _ revered populist and reviled warlord _ was
carried home in a golden casket.
</P>
<P>
   Throngs of chanting supporters lined the narrow country road as
the hearse arrived at his house. So, too, did scores of heavily
armed soldiers and police officers, there to keep the peace in a
town famous for political violence. Sunday his supporters buried
him.
</P>
<P>
   A charismatic and coercive leader, Nkabinde was a central figure
in the bloody internecine war between supporters of the African
National Congress and the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party during
the late 1980s and early 1990s. And while that conflict settled
down after the 1994 elections, violence continued to follow
Nkabinde.
</P>
<P>
   His death last week left this small town tense and uncertain.
Many residents hope the killings _ 107 since 1997 _ will now taper
off. Others worry that Nkabinde's demise could rekindle interparty
violence ahead of national elections this year. Just hours after
his death, 11 people were gunned down in their home. Five of the
victims, all from one family, were buried Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The police and military, mounting a force of nearly 1,000, hope
to make it through this weekend of funerals without further
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ireland's Belfast, Richmond is divided between rival
factions. On one side of the divide, ANC supporters live in mud
huts and cinderblock houses. On the other side, in similar
structures, live backers of a fledgling opposition group called the
United Democratic Movement.
</P>
<P>
   That line between Ndaleni and Magoda townships is a stark legacy
of Nkabinde.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Magoda in 1961, Nkabinde grew up in a political
household. His father was a local Inkatha leader. At first Nkabinde
pursued a career in teaching, but by the mid-1980s, frustrated that
Inkatha leaders weren't serving the people, he entered politics.
</P>
<P>
   Nkabinde joined the ANC, received military training in its camps
in Angola, and returned to South Africa in 1989. He rose quickly
through the ranks, becoming the party's second in command _
according to some accounts _ by having his rivals eliminated. In
1995 he became the ANC's leader in the area.
</P>
<P>
   But two years later, amid allegations that he had worked as a
spy for the police and Inkatha during the violent years before the
1994 elections, the ANC expelled Nkabinde.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter warlord took his supporters with him, and a line was
drawn between Migoda and Ndaleni.
</P>
<P>
   Nkabinde fell under serious scrutiny of the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission, the panel charged with investigating the
apartheid era. He was also charged with 16 counts of murder in
Richmond from the early 1990s. The case against him fell apart last
September, when witnesses failed to testify, and Nkabinda returned
to Richmond. Almost immediately, he found a political home in the
new UDM, which swelled with his supporters _ and almost
immediately, the killings started again in Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday, a huge crowd chanted and danced on the Magoda
line as the violet hearse passed, carrying carried Nkabinde's
casket home.
</P>
<P>
   A few hundred yards away, divided by massive military vehicles
and party affiliation, curious residents from Ndaleni watched from
the ANC side of the line. When the hearse rounded the corner, it
was escorted by 30 vehicles belonging to the police, the military,
and Nkabinde's private protection team.
</P>
<P>
   Nkabinde's supporters resent how the ANC treated him. They
reject the claim that he was a spy, and they say that he was the
only politician who looked out for the people. Many say that since
1994, the ruling ANC has not delivered water and electricity to
their township as quickly as it has to Ndaleni.
</P>
<P>
   The people in the crowd say they will never again support the
ANC. Their leader is gone, but not their fight. ``We are not afraid
of violence,'' one supporter said. ``Since we were young we have
had violence.''

FUNERAL FOR THE `CHICKEN MAN': SHRUNKEN HEADS, INCENSE, JAZZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Armed with a walking cane and bag of the magic
potion called gris gris, the ``Chicken Man'' haunted the streets of
the French Quarter for years, a penniless and gentle wraith. But he
got a princely send-off Saturday with a colorful, rare voodoo
funeral that attracted hundreds of spectators.
</P>
<P>
   ``A rich man can have millions and a big funeral, but have no
friends and have nothing,'' declared Earl Bernhardt, a Bourbon
Street jazz impresario, during one of the eulogies. ``Chicken Man
had many friends. He died a rich man.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Chicken Man, whose name was Fred Staten, was so
poor that his body lay in limbo for more than a month following his
death at the age of 61 on Dec. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Bernhardt, whose faltering nightclub had been blessed years ago
in a voodoo ritual led by the Chicken Man and grew into a
successful venture, paid for his cremation and last rites after
learning that his body was being shuttled between the coroner's
office and various funeral homes.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a spectacle the Chicken Man _ who gained his
nickname because he used to bite the heads off chickens during
voodoo rituals _ would have loved.
</P>
<P>
   Throngs overflowed three adjoining chapels at the funeral home,
where the air was rich with incense. Two black voodoo priestesses
lectured, chanted, danced, and sang before an altar decorated with
shrunken heads and tiny skulls, while young white acolytes swayed
to a mystic beat. In a requiem for ``our beloved Chicken Man,'' a
priestess named Ava mixed soil and water for his eternal journey,
then added a dollop of his ``favorite dish'' from a bottle of gin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The French Quarter was his church,'' said Ava, in a white
turban. ``He gave everything away to anybody,'' serving as a
minister to all, ``purple and green, straight and gay. Now the
Chicken Man is on the other side, he has become one of our
ancestors like Marie Laveau,'' the legendary ``Voodoo Queen'' of
New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Another priestess named Miriam, also wearing a turban, along
with a robe festooned with plastic snakes, produced a fat, writhing
live serpent for a final dance before the remains of the Chicken
Man were borne off in a glass-cased hearse pulled by two white
horses.
</P>
<P>
   The cortege was accompanied by a mounted police escort, and a
jazz band and voodoo bongo drummers, including a figure in a long
black dress whose facial powder failed to hide his 5 o'clock
shadow. Hundreds marched and danced in the ``second line,'' which
traditionally follows the mourners at jazz funerals, as the
procession wound through the narrow streets where the Chicken Man
once roamed.
</P>
<P>
   With the first of the Mardi Gras parades beginning this weekend,
the final journey of the Chicken Man was an appropriate prelude to
the season of pagan festivals.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans' history of voodoo dates back more than two
centuries. The practice was imported by Haitian slaves who fused
Catholic symbols with rituals developed by their African ancestors
to communicate with the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Voodoo became widespread here, creating a bond between thousands
of oppressed blacks. According to Bethany Bultman's travel book,
``New Orleans,'' in 1782 ``the governor of Louisiana sought to
outlaw the practice of voodoo out of the fear that its evil forces
would serve as a rallying point for a slave uprising.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being stamped out, the spiritualism was raised to an
art form in the 19th century by Marie Laveau (1794-1881), whose
remains are enshrined in a crypt in St. Louis No. 1 Cemetery on the
edge of the French Quarter. Believers, as well as tourists, still
use stones to carve X marks on the face of her tomb.
</P>
<P>
   Since the city lies below sea level, bodies are put to rest
above ground. The tomb of former Mayor Dutch Morial, the father of
the present mayor, occupies a space next to Laveau. Several
cemeteries claim to contain the remains of the Voodoo Queen's
daughter, Marie II, who became a popular practitioner herself.
</P>
<P>
   Voodoo remains a genuine observance among cults who buy their
``potents'' from F &AMP; F Botanica on North Broad Street. The manager,
Felix Figueroa Jr., says the shop does not necessarily cater to the
voodoo trade, but adds, ``We carry spiritual and religious
products, candles, incense, statues, herbs. We've got everything
you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Voodoo assumes a phonier and more commercial form along Bourbon
Street, where several shops specialize in trinkets for tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, crowds lined the sidewalks as the ashes of the Chicken
Man were noisily led down Bourbon Street and around the corner to
his resting place in a voodoo temple.

<P>
   The first thing you notice about William Jefferson Clinton is
how tall he is. The second is the seductive power he has of making
you feel, from the first moment of meeting, that he is someone you
know well. The third is his sharp intelligence, which allows you to
speak to him about anything at all, even the prickliest topics,
provided you know when to bring it up.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, someone not enamored of him forewarned me: ``The
dangerous thing about these gifts is that Clinton uses them to make
you feel that nothing could interest him more than what you are
saying to him.''
</P>
<P>
   I met him first at a dinner given by William Styron in his
summer house in Martha's Vineyard in August of 1995. During his
first campaign, Clinton had mentioned that his favorite book was
``One Hundred Years of Solitude.'' I said at the time _ and I was
quoted in print _ that I thought he had said it simply to pull in
the Latin vote. He had not forgotten _ after greeting me in
Martha's Vineyard, he at once assured me that what he said had been
quite sincere.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Fuentes and I have good reason for considering that
evening as a whole chapter in our memoirs. From the beginning, we
were disarmed by the interest, respect and humor with which he
listened to us, treating our words as if they were gold dust.
</P>
<P>
   His mood corresponded with his appearance. His hair was short,
like a scrubbing brush, his skin tanned _ he had the healthy and
almost insolent look of a sailor ashore, and he was wearing a
college sweatshirt with some logo on the chest. At 49, he looked
like an exuberant survivor of the generation of '68, who had smoked
marijuana, knew the Beatles by heart and had demonstrated against
the Vietnam war.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner began at eight, with some 14 guests around the table, and
lasted until midnight. Bit by bit, the conversation came down to a
kind of literary round table involving the president and the three
writers. The first topic to come up was the forthcoming Summit of
the Americas. Clinton had wanted it held in Miami, where it did
take place. Carlos Fuentes considered that New Orleans or Los
Angeles had stronger historical claims, and he and I argued
strongly for them until it became clear that the president had no
intention of changing his plans because he was counting on
reelection support from Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget the votes, Mr. President,'' Carlos said to him. ``Lose
Florida and make history.''
</P>
<P>
   That phrase set the tone. When we spoke of the problems of
narco-traffic, the president heard me out generously. ``Thirty
million drug addicts in the U.S. go to show that the North American
mafia are more powerful than those in Colombia, and the authorities
much more corrupt.'' When I spoke to him about relations with Cuba,
he seemed even more receptive. ``If Fidel and you could sit and
talk face to face, all problems would completely disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   When we talked about Latin America in general, we realized that
he was much more interested than we had supposed, although he
lacked some essential background. When the conversation seemed to
stiffen a bit, we asked him what his favorite movie was, and he
answered ``High Noon,'' by Fred Zinneman, whom he had recently
honored in London. When we asked him what he was reading, he sighed
and mentioned a book on the economic wars of the future, author and
title unknown to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better to read `Don Quixote,''' I said to him. ``Everything's
in there.'' Now, the `Quixote' is a book that is not read nearly as
much as is claimed, although very few will admit to not having read
it. With two or three quotes, Clinton showed that he knew it very
well indeed. Responding, he asked us what our favorite books were.
Styron said his was ``Huckleberry Finn.''
</P>
<P>
   I would have said ``Oedipus Rex,'' which has been my bedtable
book for the last 20 years, but I named ``The Count of Monte
Cristo,'' mainly for reasons of technique, which I had some trouble
explaining.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his was the ``Meditations of Marcus Aurelius,'' and
Carlos Fuentes stuck loyally to ``Absalom, Absalom,'' Faulkner's
stellar novel, no question, although others would choose ``Light in
August'' for purely personal reasons. Clinton, in homage to
Faulkner, got to his feet and, pacing round the table, recited from
memory Benji's monologue, the most thrilling passage, and perhaps
the most hermetic, from ``The Sound and the Fury.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner got us to talking about the affinities between
Caribbean writers and the cluster of great Southern novelists in
the United States. It made much more sense to us to think of the
Caribbean not as a geographical region surrounded by its sea but as
a much wider historical and cultural belt stretching from the north
of Brazil to the Mississippi basin.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Twain, William Faulkner, John Steinbeck and so many others
would then be just as Caribbean as Jorge Amado and Derek Walcott.
Clinton, born and raised in Arkansas, a southern state, applauded
the notion and professed himself happy to be a Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   It was close to midnight, and he had to break off the
conversation to take an urgent call from Gerry Adams, to whom at
that moment he gave the authority to campaign and raise funds in
the United States for peace in Northern Ireland. That should have
been the ending to an unforgettable evening, but Carlos Fuentes
took it further by asking the president who he thought of as his
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   His reply was immediate and abrupt: ``My only enemy is
right-wing religious fundamentalism.'' That pronouncement ended the
evening. The other times I saw him, in public or in private, I had
the same impression as I had that first time. Bill Clinton was the
complete opposite of the idea Latin Americans have of presidents of
the United States.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given all that, does it seem right that this exceptional human
being should be prevented from fulfilling his historical destiny
simply because he was unable to find a private place to make love?
That is just what happened. The most powerful man in the world was
kept from consummating his secret passions by the invisible
presence of a secret service that served as much to restrain as to
protect.
</P>
<P>
   There are no curtains on the Oval Office windows, no bolt on the
door of the president's private bathroom. The vase of flowers that
appears behind the president in photographs of him at his desk has
been claimed by the press to be a hiding-place for microphones to
consecrate the mysteries of presidential audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Even sadder, however, is the fact that the president only wanted
to do what the run of men have done in private with their women
from the beginning of the world, and a puritan stolidity not only
impeded him, but even denied him the right to deny it.
</P>
<P>
   Jonas invented the literature of fiction when he convinced his
wife that his homecoming was three days late because a whale had
swallowed him. Sheltering behind that ancient argument, Clinton
denied having any sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, and denied
it with his head held high, like any self-respecting unfaithful
husband. In the end, his personal drama is a purely domestic
matter, between himself and Hillary, and she has stood by him in
the eyes of the world with Homeric dignity.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to lie in order to deceive; but it is quite
another to conceal truths in order to protect that mythical
dimension of human existence that is private life. Quite rightly,
no one is obliged to give evidence against himself. For having
persisted in his first denials, Clinton would have been prosecuted
in any case _ that's what it was about _ but it is much more
dignified to perjure oneself defending the privacy of the heart
than to be absolved at the expense of love.
</P>
<P>
   Disastrously, with the same insistence with which he had denied
blame, he later admitted it and went on admitting it over all the
media, written, visual and spoken, to the point of humiliation _ a
fatal error in an uncertain lover, whose secret life will go into
the history books not for having made love badly but for having
made it a lot less glorious than it should be.
</P>
<P>
   Ludicrously, he submitted to oral sex while he talked on the
telephone with a senator. He supplanted himself with a frigid
cigar. He naturally used all kinds of tricks of avoidance, but the
more he tried the more his inquisitors came up with evidence
against him, for puritanism is insatiable and feeds on its own
excrement.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a vast and sinister conspiracy of fanatics aimed at
the personal destruction of a political adversary whose stature
they could not abide. The method was the criminal use of justice by
a fundamentalist prosecutor called Kenneth Starr, whose fierce and
salacious questioning seemed to excite these fanatics to the point
of orgasm.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Bill Clinton we met some four months ago, at a gala dinner
in the White House for Andres Pastrana, president of Colombia,
seemed quite different _ no longer the open-minded academic of
Martha's Vineyard, but someone under sentence, thinner and
uncertain, who could not conceal with a professional smile an
organic weariness like the metal fatigue that destroys planes.
</P>
<P>
   Some days before, at a press dinner with Katherine Graham, the
golden woman of The Washington Post, someone had remarked that,
judging by the trials of Clinton, the United States still seemed to
be the country of Nathaniel Hawthorne. That night in the White
House, I realized just what that meant.
</P>
<P>
   The reference was to the great American novelist of last
century, who denounced in his work the horrors of New England
fundamentalism, where the witches of Salem were burned alive. His
main novel, ``The Scarlet Letter,'' is the drama of Hester Prynne,
a young married woman who bore a child in secret by another man. A
Kenneth Starr of the day condemned her to wear a penitent's shirt
bearing the letter ``A'' of the puritan code, the color and smell
of blood.
</P>
<P>
   An agent of the order followed her everywhere beating a drum so
that pedestrians could keep out of her way. The ending must surely
keep prosecutor Starr awake, for the secret father of Hester's
child turned out to be a minister of the cult that made a martyr of
her.
</P>
<P>
   The method and the morality of the procedures were essentially
the same. When Clinton's enemies failed to find what they needed to
bring him down, they hounded him with mined interrogations until
they trapped him here and there in minor inconsistencies. Then they
forced him to accuse himself in public, and to apologize for things
he had not even done, live, using the technology of universal
information that is nothing more than a trimillennial version of
the drums that persecuted Hester Prynne.
</P>
<P>
   From the prosecutor's questions, cunning and concupiscent, even
small children became aware of the lies their parents told to keep
from them how they came into being. Suffering from metal fatigue,
Clinton committed the unpardonable folly of violently punishing an
invented enemy 5,397 nautical miles from the White House, to
distract attention from his personal plight.
</P>
<P>
   Toni Morrison, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature and a
great writer of this agonizing century, summed it up in one
inspired phrase:
</P>
<P>
   ``They treated him like a black president.''

Faulkner, got to his feet and, pacing round the table, recited from
memory Benji's monologue, the most thrilling passage, and perhaps
the most hermetic, from ``The Sound and the Fury.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner got us to talking about the affinities between
Caribbean writers and the cluster of great Southern novelists in
the United States. It made much more sense to us to think of the
Caribbean not as a geographical region surrounded by its sea but as
a much wider historical and cultural belt stretching from the north
of Brazil to the Mississippi basin.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Twain, William Faulkner, John Steinbeck and so many others
would then be just as Caribbean as Jorge Amado and Derek Walcott.
Clinton, born and raised in Arkansas, a southern state, applauded
the notion and professed himself happy to be a Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   It was close to midnight, and he had to break off the
conversation to take an urgent call from Gerry Adams, to whom at
that moment he gave the authority to campaign and raise funds in
the United States for peace in Northern Ireland. That should have
been the ending to an unforgettable evening, but Carlos Fuentes
took it further by asking the president who he thought of as his
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   His reply was immediate and abrupt: ``My only enemy is
right-wing religious fundamentalism.'' That pronouncement ended the
evening. The other times I saw him, in public or in private, I had
the same impression as I had that first time. Bill Clinton was the
complete opposite of the idea Latin Americans have of presidents of
the United States.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given all that, does it seem right that this exceptional human
being should be prevented from fulfilling his historical destiny
simply because he was unable to find a private place to make love?
That is just what happened. The most powerful man in the world was
kept from consummating his secret passions by the invisible
presence of a secret service that served as much to restrain as to
protect.
</P>
<P>
   There are no curtains on the Oval Office windows, no bolt on the
door of the president's private bathroom. The vase of flowers that
appears behind the president in photographs of him at his desk has
been claimed by the press to be a hiding-place for microphones to
consecrate the mysteries of presidential audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Even sadder, however, is the fact that the president only wanted
to do what the run of men have done in private with their women
from the beginning of the world, and a puritan stolidity not only
impeded him, but even denied him the right to deny it.
</P>
<P>
   Jonas invented the literature of fiction when he convinced his
wife that his homecoming was three days late because a whale had
swallowed him. Sheltering behind that ancient argument, Clinton
denied having any sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, and denied
it with his head held high, like any self-respecting unfaithful
husband. In the end, his personal drama is a purely domestic
matter, between himself and Hillary, and she has stood by him in
the eyes of the world with Homeric dignity.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to lie in order to deceive; but it is quite
another to conceal truths in order to protect that mythical
dimension of human existence that is private life. Quite rightly,
no one is obliged to give evidence against himself. For having
persisted in his first denials, Clinton would have been prosecuted
in any case _ that's what it was about _ but it is much more
dignified to perjure oneself defending the privacy of the heart
than to be absolved at the expense of love.
</P>
<P>
   Disastrously, with the same insistence with which he had denied
blame, he later admitted it and went on admitting it over all the
media, written, visual and spoken, to the point of humiliation _ a
fatal error in an uncertain lover, whose secret life will go into
the history books not for having made love badly but for having
made it a lot less glorious than it should be.
</P>
<P>
   Ludicrously, he submitted to oral sex while he talked on the
telephone with a senator. He supplanted himself with a frigid
cigar. He naturally used all kinds of tricks of avoidance, but the
more he tried the more his inquisitors came up with evidence
against him, for puritanism is insatiable and feeds on its own
excrement.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a vast and sinister conspiracy of fanatics aimed at
the personal destruction of a political adversary whose stature
they could not abide. The method was the criminal use of justice by
a fundamentalist prosecutor called Kenneth Starr, whose fierce and
salacious questioning seemed to excite these fanatics to the point
of orgasm.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Bill Clinton we met some four months ago, at a gala dinner
in the White House for Andres Pastrana, president of Colombia,
seemed quite different _ no longer the open-minded academic of
Martha's Vineyard, but someone under sentence, thinner and
uncertain, who could not conceal with a professional smile an
organic weariness like the metal fatigue that destroys planes.
</P>
<P>
   Some days before, at a press dinner with Katherine Graham, the
golden woman of The Washington Post, someone had remarked that,
judging by the trials of Clinton, the United States still seemed to
be the country of Nathaniel Hawthorne. That night in the White
House, I realized just what that meant.
</P>
<P>
   The reference was to the great American novelist of last
century, who denounced in his work the horrors of New England
fundamentalism, where the witches of Salem were burned alive. His
main novel, ``The Scarlet Letter,'' is the drama of Hester Prynne,
a young married woman who bore a child in secret by another man. A
Kenneth Starr of the day condemned her to wear a penitent's shirt
bearing the letter ``A'' of the puritan code, the color and smell
of blood.
</P>
<P>
   An agent of the order followed her everywhere beating a drum so
that pedestrians could keep out of her way. The ending must surely
keep prosecutor Starr awake, for the secret father of Hester's
child turned out to be a minister of the cult that made a martyr of
her.
</P>
<P>
   The method and the morality of the procedures were essentially
the same. When Clinton's enemies failed to find what they needed to
bring him down, they hounded him with mined interrogations until
they trapped him here and there in minor inconsistencies. Then they
forced him to accuse himself in public, and to apologize for things
he had not even done, live, using the technology of universal
information that is nothing more than a trimillennial version of
the drums that persecuted Hester Prynne.
</P>
<P>
   From the prosecutor's questions, cunning and concupiscent, even
small children became aware of the lies their parents told to keep
from them how they came into being. Suffering from metal fatigue,
Clinton committed the unpardonable folly of violently punishing an
invented enemy 5,397 nautical miles from the White House, to
distract attention from his personal plight.
</P>
<P>
   Toni Morrison, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature and a
great writer of this agonizing century, summed it up in one
inspired phrase:
</P>
<P>
   ``They treated him like a black president.''

ANOTHER LESSON IN AU PAIR CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN MCNAMARA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ We have been hearing a lot lately about the ``rule of
law,'' as if the law were immutable, exempt from the influence of
power and prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   We know better, of course. One of the dispiriting lessons at
century's end has been just how much class and race shape judicial
outcomes, or just how pliable the rule of law can be.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the disparate resolutions of similar cases in
Massachusetts courtrooms last week.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day that lawyers settled a civil lawsuit to prevent
Louise Woodward from profiting from the death of Matthew Eappen,
jurors convicted Luis Restrepo of killing his girlfriend's baby.
Beyond the coincidence of timing _ Restrepo was indicted in the
death of 9-month-old Tiffany Delgado on the same day 8-month-old
Matty Eappen suffered his fatal injuries _ these two Middlesex
County infanticide cases have proceeded as if in parallel
universes.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, the rule of law meant one thing for Louise, the
British au pair who killed the son of Newton doctors, and another
for Luis, the illegal Colombian immigrant who killed the daughter
of a Lowell mother on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Restrepo sat in jail for almost two years awaiting trial. Now
that the trial is over _ he was convicted of involuntary
manslaughter last Thursday _ he sits there still.
</P>
<P>
   How unlike the Woodward case. Found guilty of second-degree
murder by a jury, Louise saw a judge reduce her conviction to
manslaughter, set her sentence at the 279 days served, and release
her _ all in the course of a single day.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no such judicial sense of urgency, no compelling
desire for ``closure'' in the case of Luis Restrepo. He will not be
sentenced until Feb. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Why the long delay? Will it really take a month to prepare a
sentencing report on his immigration status, his third-grade
education? Or do those circumstances explain why Luis languishes in
jail while Louise studies law in England?
</P>
<P>
   At least Restrepo has had interesting company in recent days in
the Cambridge jail. In addition to the usual offenders and
defendants awaiting trial, Wilson Lee, a Chinatown restaurateur,
spent four days in a cell atop the county courthouse last week.
</P>
<P>
   His crime? Bad taste.
</P>
<P>
   His West Newton neighbors are offended by his unfinished
McMansion on Wykeham Road. The ``White Elephant'' and the ``Sugar
Cube,'' they call it. In their pique at Lee's lack of conformity
and lack of progress on his dream house, they pressured the city to
make the interloper complete his architectural curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   The white contemporary certainly stands in stark contrast to the
brick Tudors that line the street. The chain-link fence around the
work site does lack something in aesthetic appeal. But the city did
approve Lee's building plans. He does pay his property taxes. He
says he has spent $118,000 in the last six months to try to
complete work on the home for his wife and three sons.
</P>
<P>
   Did he get in over his head? Perhaps. Did he underestimate the
enmity of his conformist neighbors? Surely. But contrast the law's
treatment of Wilson Lee in Newton with the law's treatment of
absentee slumlords in Boston, where otherwise healthy neighborhoods
are blighted by abandoned buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Did Richard Campana of Wellesley go to jail to answer for his
rodent-infested property in the South End? Did Stainer Dewing of
Newton do time for a Jamaica Plain house targeted by vandals for a
decade? Was Edward Franco of Randolph jailed for abandoning his
buildings on Blue Hill Avenue?
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the city last fall published photographs of their city
properties alongside pictures of their suburban homes in their
hometown papers. Two of the three are in the process of selling or
renovating their properties.
</P>
<P>
   In Newton, an unusual house gets you jailed. In Boston, an
abandoned building gets you embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Topazio, Lee's attorney, can only imagine what will
happen at his client's next court date on Feb. 10. Earl Howard,
Restrepo's lawyer, is no more certain what will happen on Feb 23.
He does know there will be no civil suit to stop Restrepo from
profiting from the death of Tiffany Delgado.
</P>
<P>
   The rule of law may be uncertain, but the rules of the
markeplace are not: Luis is not Louise; his is a story no one wants
to buy.

FOR SHIPS, END OF THE DOTTED (AND DASHED) LINE 
</HEADLINE>

 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ At midnight Sunday (Jan. 31) the most
evocative of maritime signals, SOS, went the way of the dodo and
the gramophone as Morse Code becomes officially obsolete after
serving mariners for a century.
</P>
<P>
   Under a world agreement forged by the United Nations, the famous
dot-and-dash code is done as an official channel of maritime
communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morse was the language of the sea when I first went to sea 41
years ago,'' said Captain Ronald W. Warwick, 58, skipper of the
Queen Elizabeth 2, legendary flagship of the Cunard Line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you hardly ever hear it. It's been overtaken by new
communications technology.''
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, nearly all of the world's tens of thousands of
oceangoing freighters, container vessels and passenger liners will
be required by international law to be equipped with high-tech
safety gear, known as the Global Maritime Distress and Safety
System, which automatically signals to rescue stations ashore when
a ship gets into serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The signals give the name and precise location of the vessel,
along with details of the emergency, such as shipboard fire,
explosion or collision. The system can be activated instantaneously
in a catastrophe and includes satellite positioning beacons that
float free from a sinking ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system should ensure that no ship in distress can vanish
without a trace, and that more lives can be saved,'' said William
A. O'Neil, secretary-general of the International Maritime
Organization, the London-based UN agency responsible for sea
safety.
</P>
<P>
   But there is concern that thousands of freighters and even
passenger ships belonging to companies based in the Third World
will ignore the new regulations, putting their crews and passengers
at huge risk in the years ahead as stations on land and the
dwindling numbers of radio officers at sea stop monitoring the old
emergency frequencies, even on busy shipping lanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big change, and will have a major impact,'' said
Kathleen Fleming, a marine communications officer with the Rescue
Coordination Center in Halifax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, it's an improvement, but there is concern about the
fewer radio operators,'' she said. ``The real nightmare is there
may come a time when there is a ship in danger, going down, sending
out a `Mayday' or Morse on old radio equipment, and nobody is
listening on land or sea.''
</P>
<P>
   The old systems will not be phased out immediately by coast
guards and other rescue groups, however, and most modern skippers,
including Cunard's Warwick, see the new equipment as a leap
forward. Indeed, many top-line vessels, the QE2 among them,
switched to the global distress systems two or three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still, old salts mourn the passing of a grand sea tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Morse Code and the radio officers who sent it saved a lot
of lives over the decades,'' said Warwick, whose father, William
Warwick, also served as captain of the QE2. ``But something better
has come along, and ships that use it will be safer.''
</P>
<P>
   That something better is not just the Maritime Distress System,
which bounces calls off satellites, but also advances in
communications technology that have made e-mail, faxes and
crystal-clear phone calls as commonplace on the bridge of a ship in
the most remote sea as in a business office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, given the speed of change, it's perhaps a bit of a
surprise that radio telegraphy has survived at sea as long as it
has,'' said Harrison Drown, a retired merchant marine officer in
Newfoundland. ``Kind of amazing, in the last days of the 20th
century, that there are ships still at sea that rely on the sure
hand of a Morse radio officer for all their communications.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Boy Scouts scrapped the Morse Code requirement in 1991
as an antiquated skill _ although a hugely popular feature on the
organization's web site allows visitors to translate their names or
short messages into Morse Code.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts-born inventor Samuel F. B. Morse sent his first
successful message, ``What hath God wrought,'' in 1844, in an era
when steamships were noisy novelties and treadle-powered sewing
machines the ultimate in high tech.
</P>
<P>
   The telegraph, dependent on cables, remained useless to vessels
at sea until near the end of the 19th century, when Guglielmo
Marconi devised the wireless telegraph, precursor to radio.
</P>
<P>
   Shipping history was made in March 1899 when an off-course
steamer, the Elbe, slammed into a lightship in the Strait of Dover,
off southeast England, and started to sink. Lifeboats were summoned
by wireless _ the first use of the device in sea rescue, according
to the International Maritime Organization.
</P>
<P>
   In the 100 years since, ships in trouble on the high seas have
relied on radio to call for help. According to the International
Maritime Organization, the signal SOS was adopted as the standard
distress signal a few months after the Titanic disaster of 1912, in
which more than 1,500 passengers and crew, of 2,200 aboard, lost
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to popular myth, SOS does not stand for ``Save Our
Ship,'' ``Save Our Souls,'' or ``Send Out Succor'' _ it stands for
nothing at all, but was adopted worldwide because it is so simple
to remember and send in Morse Code: dot-dot-dot dash-dash-dash
dot-dot-dot. The other international distress call, ``Mayday,''
used in voice radio communications, is a corruption of the French
``m'aider,'' or ``help me.''
</P>
<P>
   The new international maritime regulations require that all
freighters and passenger ships over 300 gross tonnage, and
operating on deep sea routes, be equipped with the new satellite
signaling systems and telecommunications equipment, starting
Monday. The rules do not apply to coastal vessels, most commercial
fishing craft or pleasure boats.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lloyd's Register, the London-based shipping
intelligence group, there are 56,359 vessels over 300 tons
worldwide. How many will comply with the newest law of the sea is
an open question.
</P>
<P>
   Other shipping sources estimated that a third of all ships,
especially those operated by companies in developing countries or
former Soviet Bloc, will ignore the regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with officials of shipping organizations in the
United States, Canada, Britain and Singapore suggest that almost
all ships operated by North American and western European firms, as
well as companies based in advanced nations of Asia, have made the
switch to the advanced gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our members have installations aboard their ships,''
said Kathy Metcalf, director of maritime affairs for the
Washington-based Chamber of Shipping of America. ``But there is
concern that, globally, there are a lot of ships that aren't ready
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the new distress signaling devices, which cost
anywhere from $35,000 to $55,000, still have some bugs and quirks.
So even those who see the equipment as a major advance in rescue
technology raise some concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Odd things can happen,'' said Fleming. ``We've received alerts
that indicated a vessel in trouble'' in the North Atlantic ``that
turned out to be in the Black Sea or off the coast of Vietnam. But
these are oddities, and are a matter of making a link to the right
rescue coordination center.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, ships in trouble have relied on radio officers
signaling in Morse or by radiotelephone to reach other ships or a
radio station on shore. The nearest ships would respond, while
alerting the nearest rescue centers to send help. It could be a
haphazard affair _ not much different than the chaos and confusion
that surrounded the sinking of the Titanic _ with frantic calls for
help bouncing from one radio operator to the next. Rescuers were
often not in direct contact with the crew of the sinking or damaged
ship, and were forced to rely on third- or fourth-hand relayed
radio messages for sea coordinates.
</P>
<P>
   The UN-mandated global distress and monitoring systems not only
send an automated distress signal but also put endangered ships in
direct radio contact with the nearest rescue coordination centers,
whether Boston or Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The equipment has already been proven in action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system gives us an instant lock on the ship, lets us know
where it is and what kind of trouble it's in,'' said Jack O'Dell, a
spokesman for the US Coast Guard. ``It takes more of the `search'
time out of search and rescue. And, in rescue operations, saved
time often means more saved lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Morse Code that has served ships for so long is
about to become the territory of ham radio enthusiasts and other
hobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Professionally, Morse Code is finished,'' said Neal McEwen, a
historian of telegraph and radio in Dallas. ``But with tens of
thousands of hams out there talking from Japan to Russia to the
USA, it's going to remain very much a living language of the
airwaves.''

TV'S COURT JESTER IS IN TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ When it comes to situation comedies, Larry
Charles knows whereof he speaks, having won a pair of Emmys as a
writer on ``Seinfeld'' before going on to take the reins of ``Mad
About You'' as executive producer for two years.
</P>
<P>
   So what Charles has to say about television's signature genre is
worth heeding, especially since it seems to reflect a growing
consensus in Hollywood that the post-``Seinfeld'' era has been no
laughing matter for those who worry about the state of the sitcom
art.
</P>
<P>
   ``The form right now is in desperate need of re-inventing,''
Charles said. ``To some degree, you're seeing an exhaustion of the
sitcom formula. The audience is so knowledgeable of sitcom cliches
that they're ahead of the series. So they figure, why not watch
`Animal Planet'? It's more unpredictable.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles's diagnosis was echoed by a striking number of TV comedy
stars and producers who expressed concern during interviews with
the Globe that the genre they work in is stagnating at precisely
the wrong time. They know that, in the words of ``Home
Improvement'' star Tim Allen, ``network television is especially
vulnerable'' because disenchanted viewers can disappear in a
channel-click to cable. Yet at this moment the sitcom, a primary
engine of network television ever since America decided that it
loved Lucy in the early 1950s, appears to be running out of gas.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: With the all-important February ratings sweeps period
slated to begin on Thursday, only six sitcoms rank among the 20
highest-rated shows, two fewer than last year and only half as many
as five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998-99 season has seen viewers continue to drift away from
comedies to TV newsmagazines and cheesy ``reality'' shows like
``When Good Pets Go Bad.'' Intensifying the exodus of viewers is
the loss of those twin tent poles of comedic brilliance,
``Seinfeld'' and ``The Larry Sanders Show,'' and the perception
that such reliable comedies as ``Frasier'' have sprung creative
leaks this season.
</P>
<P>
   So what's gone wrong with the once-beloved form, and what should
the next phase of sitcom evolution look like? Among people who live
by their wit _ acting in, writing, or producing TV comedy series _
a sense of urgency underlay the answers they offered.
</P>
<P>
   To Drew Carey, star of ``The Drew Carey Show,'' an ABC comedy
focusing on working-class life in Cleveland, the answer is simple:
Sitcoms must kick their addiction to stale, shopworn formulas _
especially the yuppies-in-Manhattan formula _ once and for all, and
break out in new thematic directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to write a sitcom now, do not make it about a
single woman working at a media company in New York,'' asserted
Carey. ``It just bugs me. There are plenty of cities in America:
Cleveland, Boston. You just have to get some other subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   But the success of Carey himself _ and of Tim Allen, Jerry
Seinfeld, and Roseanne _ has contributed to another one of the
genre's problems: an overreliance on shows that grow out of
stand-up comedians' acts.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Diminishing returns
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once, shows like ``Roseanne'' energized the sitcom genre by
transferring the freewheeling personae developed onstage to the
half-hour television format. But the law of diminishing returns has
kicked in with a vengeance; more and more, something _ namely
laughter _ is lost in translation when stand-ups go sitcom. The
result is ``The Jeff Foxworthy Show'' and Carol Leifer's ``Alright
Already'' (both canceled).
</P>
<P>
   The problem could run deeper than TV's reliance in the past
decade on the same two formulas, however. It could simply be that
the sitcom form itself is getting played out after nearly 50 years.
Dean Valentine, president and CEO of the UPN network, believes the
ironic detachment favored by contemporary audiences has undercut
the popularity of sitcoms, which depend on both a cheerful
suspension of disbelief and on viewers embracing fictional
characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels fake before they even open their mouths,'' said
Valentine. ``Especially for young people, familiarity breeds
irony.'' Eighteen-year-old Marnette Patterson, who appeared in
``Something So Right'' and costars in the WB network's upcoming
``Movie Stars,'' agreed, saying the trouble with sitcoms is ``they
get a lot of older kids to play 15-year-olds with dialogue written
by 35-year-olds. They're just not funny. They try so hard to be
funny; that's what makes them so stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone believes that sitcoms have fallen on hard times.
Leslie Moonves, president of CBS Television, insisted that
``television, right now, show for show, is as good as it's ever
been.'' However, UPN's Valentine acknowledged that even some sitcom
writers in Hollywood believe the form is ``exhausted,'' having
``explored all the possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps not all. Many stars and executives, even those from
rival networks, say the way out of sitcom limbo lies along the
seriocomic path blazed by two ``dramadies'': ABC's ``Sports Night''
and Fox's ``Ally McBeal.'' Scott Sassa, the new president of NBC
Entertainment, went so far as to call ``Sports Night'' one of his
favorite shows.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal budget deficit is gone, transformed by
a strong economy into a string of projected surpluses that should
grow larger for years to come _ at least by the reckoning that
passes for fiscal forecasting in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the deficit is hardly the end of the government's
financial troubles, however, and it marks the beginning of a new
debate over how fiscal policy should be used to shape the nation's
future.
</P>
<P>
   It's like a family that after spending more than it earns month
after month suddenly finds itself bringing in more than it spends _
great news, to be sure, but a turnaround that still leaves the
family with the debt it ran up during the hard times and the choice
of whether to pay it off.
</P>
<P>
   Washington was never in much danger of maxing out its credit
cards. But the national debt was built up over decades of deficit
spending _ the federal government has not run steady surpluses
since the 1920s _ and it remains an economic millstone of
considerable proportions. Only now do Congress and the White House
have the luxury of debating what to do about it.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to complete the transformation of the Democratic Party's
tax-and-spend reputation into one of economic virtue, President
Clinton has already made debt reduction a centerpiece of his agenda
this year, saying it is the best way to insure that the country
remains prosperous and able to handle the strains the aging
baby-boom generation will place on the social welfare system. The
details of his plan are confusing, with some Republicans saying the
president is advocating a sophisticated shell game, but Clinton is
actively trying to recast an otherwise abstract goal in tangible
terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we in the United States could actually be doing something
to pay down our debt while saving Social Security and Medicare,''
Clinton told a meeting at the White House last week, ``we would
keep these interest rates down, and it would be an enormous hedge
against whatever unforeseen future volatility occurs in the global
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   All too aware that they are being painted by Democrats as
willing to risk Social Security's future for a burst of immediate
gratification, Republicans are nonetheless pressing ahead with
their calls to use the surplus for big tax cuts, saying there is
more than enough spare cash to clean up the nation's books, save
Social Security and return some money to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Republicans say, debt reduction will never happen
because Democrats _ admittedly with some help from the other side
of the aisle _ will spend the surplus before it materializes. Since
the real choice then, in the Republican view, is between new
spending and tax cuts, the best course economically and politically
is tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Debt reduction ultimately gets trumped in a political process
by government spending,'' said John Cogan, a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution and a former budget official in the Reagan and
Bush administrations. ``Achieving a sustained policy of debt
reduction is very difficult, to say the least.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several ways to measure the national debt, but the
most meaningful is to look at the debt held by the public _ the
individuals, Wall Street firms and banks from around the world that
buy the bonds sold by the Treasury Department. There is currently
$3.7 trillion in public debt outstanding, which is equal to 45
percent of the economy's total output.
</P>
<P>
   In those terms, the debt peaked at the end of World War II, when
it hit 108 percent of the gross domestic product. Its recent high
was in 1993, after a decade of growing deficits, when it hit 50
percent. Should all of the surpluses projected for the next decade
be used for debt reduction, the debt would decline to below 10
percent by 2009, its lowest level since World War I.
</P>
<P>
   In economic terms, the question of whether debt reduction should
be a higher priority than tax cuts or spending increases is an easy
call. Most economists agree that paying down the national debt is
the surest way to spur more savings and investment, create more
jobs, improve productivity and generally enable the economy to grow
faster.
</P>
<P>
   After all, every dollar the government has to borrow to pay for
fighter jets or new education programs is a dollar not available to
a promising but cash-starved technology company or to a
manufacturer eager to invest in new equipment that would enable it
to compete more effectively in cutthroat global markets.
Competition from Washington for capital also drives up interest
rates for mortgages and car loans as well as for corporate
borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   And every dollar that Washington has to spend making interest
payments is a dollar the government does not have available for
other uses _ say, shoring up the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NATIONAL-DEBT-REVIEW-ART-2NDTAKE-NYT &QL; 
WASHINGTON: Security system. &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Reducing the federal debt to the public at this stage is
unquestionably the most important thing that I believe that we can
do if meeting the future needs of the economy is the standard,''
said Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan last week.
</P>
<P>
   To some people there is also a moral dimension to the issue.
Debt, in their view, is just plain wrong, an obligation that needs
to be paid off as soon as possible, whether it is owed by a farmer,
a company or the U.S. Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the abstract we think of it as fiscal sin,'' said Robert
Reischauer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, quickly
adding that ``rather than repent we charge yet again.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is on the political level that the issue gets messiest.
</P>
<P>
   While members of both parties pledge allegiance to austerity and
the long-term benefits it promises, history suggests that the
short-term drive to survive the next election leads to some degree
of profligacy. Last year Republicans as well as Democrats hailed
Clinton's call to save ``every penny'' of the developing surpluses
for Social Security. By the end of a year in which they agreed on
very few things, lawmakers from both parties agreed to a
budget-busting highway and mass transit bill and to $20 billion in
extra spending out of this year's surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Using the surplus for tax cuts or popular programs is just too
much of a temptation for politicians. However virtuous it might be
to forswear spending money that could otherwise go to debt
reduction, said Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional
Budget Office, ``You can't go home to your district and have a
ribbon cutting.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, for both political and policy reasons, Clinton has
wrapped himself in the mantle of debt reduction. It is a measure of
his political dexterity that even as he sets out sweeping new
spending initiatives in the budget he will send Congress on Monday,
he may well succeed, as he did last year, in using fiscal rectitude
as a blocking maneuver against the Republican tax-cutting drive.
</P>
<P>
   The partisan bitterness that has emerged over the impeachment
also suggests there is little chance of any deal between the White
House and Congress on Social Security, tax cuts and spending.
</P>
<P>
   But in economic terms such an impasse might not prove to be such
a bad thing. Gridlock amounts to a policy decision by default
because running a surplus is synonymous with paying down debt; it
automatically reduces the government's borrowing needs. All of
this, of course, assumes that the economy and the stock market
remain strong enough that the surplus actually materializes.

EVA CASSIDY`S GIFT 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ One Sunday morning last November, a CD caught Fred
Taylor's eye. On the cover was a fuzzy photograph of a young woman
with her blond hair pulled back in a haphazard braid, smiling
sideways for the camera, water shimmering in the background _ not
the cool, glossy product the jazz impresario is accustomed to.
``The girl was this country, wholesome type, and I thought `What
the devil is this?' '' Taylor recalls. ``So I put it on, and I'm
getting dressed, and this voice comes on. And I just stopped cold
in my tracks. I listened to cut after cut and each one was more
incredible than the one before. I was flipping out. My first
thought was, `I've got to get her into the club.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The club is Scullers, the Boston jazz venue where Taylor is
entertainment director. As luck would have it, that particular CD
was sitting on top of one of the enormous piles of new records sent
to Taylor each week by promoters, agents, and record companies. He
reached for the liner notes to learn more about the stunning
singer. And that, Taylor says, is when his heart fell into his
stomach. Eva Cassidy had died two years earlier of melanoma, at the
age of 33.
</P>
<P>
   ``I nearly broke into tears. I think I was listening to her sing
`Autumn Leaves' at the time, which can do it.'' Even now Taylor's
eyes grow misty speaking about Cassidy, a Washington, D.C., singer
whose ``Songbird'' CD was released posthumously, in April 1998, on
the Blix Street label out of Los Angeles. ``I've been excited about
different artists. I've seen great talent and I've helped develop
it. But nothing has ever really gotten under my skin like this. And
I felt that way before I knew what had happened. . . . That just
made it much more intense.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor decided on the spot to do something wildly out of
character for a music-industry type. With no business interest or
financial stake in her career, Taylor took it upon himself to
become Cassidy's unofficial ambassador. ``I felt, and feel, so
strongly that this shouldn't go unnoticed. So I dedicated myself to
spreading the word. The day after I heard it, Monday, the calls
started coming in, and if it was anybody with any musical
sensibility at all I said, `Hey, by the way . . .' And I'd do this
`by the way' thing with everybody who called.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor soon became more concerted in his efforts to raise
awareness about Cassidy, and set out to get ``Songbird'' to the
right person in Boston radio. Enter Robin Young, a close
acquaintance of his who hosts the morning show on WBOS-FM (92.9)
and specializes in feature stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got this threatening phone call from Freddy,'' Young
recalls, ``basically saying, `If you don't listen to this cassette.
. . .' He didn't tell me the story. I just popped the cassette in.
Then I read the literature. I called him that night, and told him I
was going to put it on the radio the next day.'' That November
morning she played Cassidy's cover of Sting's ``Fields of Gold,''
announcing beforehand only that it was a tape that a friend had
given her. Not 30 seconds went by, Young says, before the phone
lines lit up.
</P>
<P>
   ``People wanted to know who she was, and where they could get
it,'' Young says. ``I talked to Bill Straw,'' president of Blix
Street Records, ``who said they had about 40 calls that day. The
next day he got a call from Amazon.com, who had sold out of it.
Bill said to me `What are you doing?' I said `Really, nothing. Just
playing it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Young continued to play the single; by the second week she had
aired a much-expanded feature about Cassidy. E-mail started
arriving, and area record stores started calling the station,
wondering where they could find the CD. Borders Records in
Burlington was getting so many requests that it put ``Songbird'' on
the WBOS listening post. Hundreds of calls were jamming the phone
lines at Blix Street. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Groundswell of interest &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And Cassidy's sudden popularity is not, evidently, a phenomenon
limited to Boston, though the area is leading the global
groundswell of interest. Last week ``Fields of Gold'' was the
most-requested track on KFOG, San Francisco's AAA radio station.
The single is climbing the charts in Australia, and the CD has
exploded in England, where it topped year-end Top 10 lists.
</P>
<P>
   It's not unusual for an established artist's album sales to
accelerate following his or her death, especially an untimely one.
But for an unknown to have her career take off posthumously is rare
indeed. One might conjecture that Eva Cassidy succumbed to cancer
just as her star was beginning to rise. When she performed at
Washington's Blues Alley in July 1996 to promote her first solo
record, ``Live at Blues Alley,'' Cassidy was already walking with a
cane _ though the soreness in her hip was still a mystery. The next
month she was diagnosed with terminal cancer.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to calibrate exactly how the tragic
circumstances surrounding the release of ``Songbird'' contribute to
the emotional pull of the music. But there's no denying Cassidy's
musical gifts: an astonishingly broad interpretive range, her
natural feel for phrasing, and the clean, clear beauty of her
voice. ``They way she does `Cheek to Cheek,' I'll put that up
against the great jazz vocalists of all time,'' says Taylor. ``And
she rewrote `Over the Rainbow.' She totally reinvented it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Cassidy's subtle, but striking, innovations with
familiar tunes were more than merely imaginative. With an intense
purity of tone matched by an equally intense purity of emotion,
Cassidy gave songs new life, even as hers was slipping away. Many
thought she was black, so soulful was her way with a melody. But
she sang jazz, gospel, folk, and pop with equal finesse, moving
with ease from ``Autumn Leaves'' to Pete Seeger's ``Oh, Had I a
Golden Thread'' to Curtis Mayfield's ``People Get Ready'' and
sounding for all the world as if she were, by turns, a jazz diva,
an earnest folk singer, and a fiery soul screamer.
</P>
<P>
   And that, by all accounts, was Cassidy's curse as well as her
blessing. An expansive musician whose love of song far exceeded her
professional ambition, Cassidy refused to narrow her focus in order
to make herself more marketable in an industry that's rigorously
dedicated to stylistic niches. Plenty of record labels came
calling; none had a clue what to do with a young woman who sounded
like Judy Collins, Aretha Franklin, and Diana Krall rolled into
one.

ONE DEFENSE AGAINST QUAKES: BUILD HOMES OF WOOD

By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Americans viewing the devastation caused by last
week's earthquake in Colombia might be tempted to knock on wood.
Wood-frame houses, the type generally built in the United States,
can stand up far better in quakes than the outwardly solid masonry
homes that crumpled so quickly in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   But even wooden homes can fall down, and each new earthquake
adds to the understanding of what more could be done to make
residential housing more quake-proof. Indeed, the last major
temblor to hit a U.S. urban area, the Northridge quake of 1994 in
the Los Angeles area, prompted a re-evaluation of building codes
when wood-frame buildings suffered far more damage than had been
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Northridge showed they don't perform as well as we thought,''
said Bob Reitherman, executive director of California Universities
for Research in Earthquake Engineering, a consortium of eight
schools. In that and other quakes, he said, ``some of them are
falling down and all of them are getting more damage than we
thought.''
</P>
<P>
   The haunting pictures from Colombia, where the official death
toll was near 1,000 and could go much higher, showed wide swaths of
row houses in the town of Armenia flattened to rubble. But nearby,
seemingly identical houses remained standing. Surprising as that
may be to an ordinary newspaper reader, that phenomenon is familiar
to any earthquake expert, since it demonstrates the capriciousness
of earthquakes. Two identical homes can be affected differently
based on the behavior of the soil beneath them or on how they are
hit by the earthquake shock waves.
</P>
<P>
   Still, home construction makes a big difference. In Colombia and
other developing nations, homes are often made of unreinforced
masonry, adobe or mud, and there are few residential building
codes. Homes in wealthier parts of Armenia, presumably with better
construction, did better.
</P>
<P>
   ``That disaster was due to poor construction, not to the size of
the earthquake,'' said George Housner, emeritus professor of
earthquake engineering at the California Institute of Technology.
``That earthquake, had it occurred near Pasadena, would not have
been a disaster at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, wooden frames tend to do better in quakes because
they have some flexibility. ``If the structure doesn't give during
the earthquake then it tends to be completely destroyed,'' said Tom
Henyey, a geological sciences professor at the University of
Southern California and director of the Southern California
Earthquake Center. ``Ductility is really the name of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But merely having a wood frame isn't enough, experts say. In
Kobe, Japan, which suffered a huge quake in 1995, many older houses
with wooden frames collapsed because they were not built to
withstand lateral forces and had extremely heavy roofs made of
traditional Japanese tiles.
</P>
<P>
   To better withstand a quake, experts say, homes need to have
what are known as shear walls, which are normally made from plywood
fastened between the upright wooden beams to help withstand
side-to-side forces. The frame of the home should also be bolted to
the foundation to make sure it doesn't slip off. And upper floors
and roofs should be securely attached to floors below.
</P>
<P>
   ``If built to code properly, the house should go through a
sizable earthquake fairly well,'' said Do Kim, director of
engineering at the Institute for Business and Home Safety, a
Boston-based nonprofit organization set up by the insurance
industry.
</P>
<P>
   But Kim also said that while the code seems to be enforced well
in California, there are other parts of the country in which
builders frequently get waivers, even though earthquakes have
occurred there in the past. These, he said, include the New Madrid
zone in and near Missouri, and the area around Charleston, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   The competition to keep home costs low is clearly a reason,
though some experts insist that quake-proofing adds only 5 percent
or so to the cost of a newly built home. Richard Cardoza, director
of architectural production at Kaufman and Broad, the largest
homebuilder in the West, said that complying with the latest Los
Angeles earthquake codes might add between $1 and $2.50 per square
foot to the price of a home, which translates into an extra $2,000
to $4,500 to the cost of a typical new three-bedroom home of 2,000
square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Existing homes can also be retrofitted, at various costs. Some
older masonry homes in Los Angeles have had steel rods put through
them from wall to wall between stories. But simple and inexpensive
steps like strapping the water heater to a wall can also make a big
difference, Kim said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even adherence to building codes is no guarantee. For one
thing, the codes are generally designed to prevent loss of life by
keeping buildings from collapsing. They are not meant to prevent
all damage.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, each earthquake seems to show that the existing code
is inadequate. ``Each time we have an earthquake we learn more''
said Dr. Henyey. Building codes have been strengthened in light of
the Northridge quake, which had a magnitude of 6.7. Reitherman said
that of 10,193 buildings deemed unsafe to occupy after that quake,
91 percent were made of wood.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, most of the 25 deaths from building damage (there
were 61 deaths overall) were at apartment buildings, particularly
two- or three-story structures in which the first floor was used
for parking. In such buildings, the bottom floor was not sturdy
enough to support ones above once shaking began. But single family
homes still suffered more damage than expected. The Institute for
Business and Home Safety estimates the insurance industry has paid
$15 billion in claims, far higher than it had foreseen.
</P>
<P>
   Reitherman's consortium recently embarked on a three-year, $6.9
million study, most of it financed by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, to find ways of designing safer wood-framed
buildings without substantially raising the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Reitherman said that most wood-framed buildings are designed by
architects rather than structural engineers. And tools for
analyzing the forces on wood-framed structures are not very
advanced. That is because good as wood might be in quakes, it is
steel and concrete, used in the expensive commercial buildings,
that get all the engineering attention.

<P>
   The trouble began when Bobbie Gallagher noticed that her
2-year-old daughter was behaving strangely, obsessively spinning
and scrupulously setting her toys in rows. Alanna Gallagher turned
out to have autism, a rare neurological disorder of unknown cause.
</P>
<P>
   So did Alanna's little brother. So did about 40 other children
who lived in the Gallaghers' town of Brick, N.J., near the
seashore.
</P>
<P>
   The parents in Brick were alarmed. On average, 1 child in 500 is
autistic; in the town, the figure is about three times that.
</P>
<P>
   But what does it mean? Does Brick have toxic chemicals in the
water, pollutants in the air?
</P>
<P>
   The problem, scientists say, may be impossible to resolve. It
was yet another instance of a phenomenon that makes many
statisticians shudder. It was a disease cluster _ the Boy Who Cried
Wolf of epidemiology.
</P>
<P>
   Every time a disease cluster turns up, communities worry,
scientists scramble for a cause and, as in the new movie based on
Jonathan Harr's 1995 book, ``A Civil Action'' (Random House), about
a leukemia cluster in Woburn, Mass., lawyers start suing. Yet over
and over again, despite years _ sometimes decades _ of efforts to
link the disease with a cause, scientists usually come up empty
handed.
</P>
<P>
   It can sound paradoxical. Here are unusual numbers of people
with a disease. Toxic chemicals are everywhere, and many of them
cause cancers and other diseases in laboratory animals. Why should
it be so hard to find a cause?
</P>
<P>
   Some disease clusters have been successfully linked to toxins:
Coal miners got black lung disease; asbestos workers got
mesothelioma. Workers cleaning containers where polyvinyl chloride
was synthesized, breathing in fumes, got cancer of the blood
vessels of the liver until machines replaced them.
</P>
<P>
   But these examples of proven cause and effect are the rare
exceptions, statisticians say. And they have two things in common:
The chemical exposure was enormous, and the disease was
extraordinarily rare.
</P>
<P>
   Most disease clusters are very different. Autism, breast cancer
and leukemia are fairly common. And even when there does seem to be
an unusually high incidence of a disease, the search for a chemical
basis usually turns up minute amounts of toxic substances that also
are found in other places where there are no clusters. In other
words, linking the suspect chemicals to the disease can be very
hard. It can also be difficult to know if a cluster is anything
more than a chance occurrence. And chance is hard to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters will naturally appear even when events occur at random,
said Dr. Persi Diaconis, a statistician at Stanford University.
``There was a famous example of this when bombs were hitting London
during World War II,'' he said. ``People were sure they were
targeting individual places and they made up the most elaborate
scenarios'' to explain how the bomb targets were selected. But in
the end, when the pattern was analyzed, the bombing turned out to
be random.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is how to draw the boundaries of a cluster.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Robins, a statistician at Harvard University's School
of Public Health, said it is a natural tendency to draw boundaries
around groups of events to make clusters happen. If there are three
children with cancer on a single block, you may draw your circle
around the block _ making that a cluster _ rather than around the
town as a whole, which may show no cluster.
</P>
<P>
   Say you do find a cluster. Unless you identify, say, black lung
or mesothelioma, statisticians say, the next question is: How can
you decide if the cluster was caused by blind random clumpings of
cases, with no environmental cause, or by a toxin in the
environment?
</P>
<P>
   Why would only one town have a disease cluster, some experts
ask, while other places with the same pollutants in the air or
water do not? One possibility might be an unidentified chemical in
a mix of pollutants that is unique to the town. But that, of
course, raises questions of how to find it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the indirect exposure problem. If there is no
direct link between chemicals and a disease, the tendency is to
look for other exposures. Could the fathers, for example, have had
their sperm affected when they were growing up? Or could the
mothers have been exposed to chemicals during pregnancy? Some
statisticians say that if people look hard enough and slice the
data enough ways and an association will emerge. What it means is
another question.
</P>
<P>
   Others are optimistic. Suzanne Condon, the director of the
bureau of environmental health assessment at the Massachusetts
Department of Public Health, said that in an unpublished study her
department found that in the Woburn case, women who drank water
from certain wells when they were pregnant were more likely to have
children who developed leukemia. ``We believe this sheds a lot of
light on what happened in Woburn,'' she said. W.R. Grace, which was
accused along with Beatrice Foods of dumping chemicals in a way
that allowed them to reach the water supply, paid $8 million into a
settlement fund. Both companies agreed to finance an expensive
cleanup plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts' health department, however, warned on its Web
page, ``Findings should be interpreted with caution due to the
limitations of conducting statistical analyses on small
populations.''
</P>
<P>
   That may not be what people want to hear, statisticians concede.
``People _ and I, too _ find it hard to accept that it is just
random chance that brought this horrible consequence,'' said Dr.
David Freedman, a statistician at the University of California at
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Some statisticians ask whether it is worthwhile to keep pouring
money and effort into searches for clusters and searches to explain
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, at what point do you say we've see too many
like this?'' Robins asked. ``Huge amounts of money'' have gone to
study disease clusters where the suspected cause was tiny amounts
of chemicals, he added, and so far, ``nothing has come of it.''

   ``She had a magnificent voice. The problem was she could sing a
telephone directory, but she didn't have a musical point of view,''
says Bruce Lundvall, president of Jazz and Classics for Capitol
Records, who considered signing her to the Blue Note label in 1994.
Instead, Lundvall paired Cassidy with Pieces of a Dream, a
Philadelphia pop-jazz unit, in the spring of 1994, trying to find
some way to develop her as an artist. But the union was misguided
and, following two singles and a tour, ultimately unsuccessful. ``I
have to admit I'm guilty of passing on a brilliant career. We
couldn't figure out what she was, and I blame myself. I talked to
her on her deathbed and told her I'd made a terrible mistake. She
said `God bless you.' She never harbored resentment.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Her mentor and lover &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Painfully shy and thoroughly uncompromising, Cassidy spent the
bulk of her brief professional life playing for a loyal following
in Washington nightclubs, painting and gardening _ her other two
passions _ by day. She met Chris Biondo, a D.C.-area engineer and
bassist, in 1986, when she wound up in his studio singing vocals on
a friend's record. Biondo subsequently became her mentor, booking
agent, producer, and lover. At the time, when record companies
expressed interest and Cassidy (who was working in a nursery)
balked at the idea of whittling down her musical identity, Biondo
was aghast. ``I wanted to choke her and say, `You idiot, it's a
job, and you may as well have one that involves singing,' '' he
says. ``But looking back I think she was right. What's happening
right now, the way she's reaching people, is a result of her pure
approach to music. She knew something all along, that you do
something because you love it, not to please someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Biondo introduced Cassidy to Chuck Brown, a
middle-aged, black, hard-rock veteran who was the godfather of
Washington's go-go scene. Against all odds, Brown and Cassidy found
in each other kindred musical spirits. ``She was the inspiration of
my life,'' says Brown. ``For years I'd been dreaming about singing
some blues and jazz with a lady. I had been afraid until I heard
that sweet, beautiful, golden voice.'' The pair became a popular
duo performing classic American songs; they recorded a CD, ``The
Other Side,'' which was self-released in 1992. Cassidy released
``Live at Blues Alley'' in June 1996. She died four months later.
It was many more months before Brown could bring himself to play
music again. ``I couldn't even go into the studio, look at her
picture on the wall, sing in the sound booth we sang in,'' he says
in a low voice. ``It was like being hit with a bolt of lightning.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Straw of Blix Street Records (best known for the Celtic
artist Mary Black) was given a copy of ``Live at Blues Alley'' in
October 1996, when Cassidy was in the last weeks of her life. ``I
knew how good she was, immediately,'' Straw recalls. ``And I knew
she wasn't going to be around to enjoy it. I was in a kind of
shock. You don't even think about business at a time like that. It
didn't occur to me to go back and meet her. I knew there wasn't
time. But I knew if it was handled properly her music would be
heard.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
An extraordinary performance &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About six months after her death, Straw flew out to meet
Cassidy's parents in Montgomery County, Md. They talked over
dinner, and Hugh and Barbara Cassidy played some of their
daughter's music that Straw hadn't heard. Straw also watched a
videotape of the tribute concert friends organized for Cassidy that
past September, only weeks before her death. She'd had a blood
transfusion that day, and had to be carried from the car into the
club, and settled on a stool onstage. ``She had a scarf covering
her head'' (Cassidy's hair fell out during chemotherapy). ``They
handed her a guitar, and she actually apologized for her lungs not
being stronger. Then she literally floated out `What a Wonderful
World.' It was extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Cassidy says that the remarkable spirit her daughter
displayed that night remained with her until the end. ``She was so
loved. It was like she was enveloped in a bubble of love from her
family and friends. She also met three other young people her own
age who had cancer, and they gave each other enormous strength.''
Her one regret, Mrs. Cassidy says, is that they chose to treat
Eva's cancer with aggressive therapies. ``At the time she was
diagnosed the doctor said if we didn't do anything she'd only have
four months to live. So she made the decision to go ahead. She
didn't even have the four months.''
</P>
<P>
   Straw and the Cassidys agreed that night to put together a new
album. ``Bruce Lundvall at Blue Note was distraught,'' says Straw.
``He wanted to put out some kind of posthumous record but his
staff, by all accounts, talked him out of it, persuading him that
he needed to focus on artists with a future. That's when I realized
that it wasn't a job for a major label, that they just wouldn't do
it. I thought we were ideally set up to do it. The fact is, we
don't have to get the same response to have it work out
economically. And I feel totally privileged to be involved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Songbird'' is an anthology of tracks from ``Live at Blues
Alley'' and songs from ``Eva by Heart,'' a posthumous collection
put together by Biondo. As for future releases, Straw says there
are some outtakes from the Blues Alley live sessions, and some
impeccable voice-guitar demos. He's bandied about the idea of doing
a series of genre albums: blues, gospel, and jazz, perhaps. BBC
Radio 2 is planning a 30-minute special. But, as Biondo states
succinctly, and with immeasurable sadness, ``Eva is a finite
musical entity. I don't think there's any way her music will be
widely heard. And yet her records generate more tears, and more
emotion, than a lot of records that outsell hers. It's because Eva
is 100 percent real. And that fuzzes your heart up.''
</P>
<P>
   Biondo is still overwhelmed by the loss. He considers Cassidy
``the definitive singer who's graced our planet,'' and calls
himself the bearer of her cross. He has dinner with Cassidy's
mother every year on Eva's birthday, at Eva's favorite restaurant.
He keeps a notebook full of e-mail and newspaper clippings about
Cassidy, a chronicle of her legacy.
</P>
<P>
   And thanks to people like Fred Taylor and Robin Young, Cassidy's
legacy won't go unnoticed. Taylor is still dreaming up ways to
spread the word; he's set his sights on putting together a
documentary about Cassidy's life. Young, who originally framed
Cassidy's brief career as a tragedy, has changed her view. ``I
remember when we first aired the story, we had a substitute jock
who heard it in her car on the way to work,'' Young explains. ``She
came bursting into the studio while I was still on the air and
said, `No, no, you're wrong about this. It was a miracle that her
voice was recorded at all. It's not a loss. It's a gift.' ''

<P>
   ROME _ It seemed like a season for traditionalists.
</P>
<P>
   First came the Vatican declaration last November that in
celebration of the third millennium of Christianity believers will
be offered a wider array of indulgences, ways to earn amnesties
from various forms of punishment in the afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the announcement just before Christmas that Padre
Pio, the celebrated Italian mystic and healer who is a hero of
traditionalist Catholics, would be beatified this May, the final
step before canonization. (Pope John Paul II has made 270 saints,
more than any other pope in history, and has beatified almost 800
people.)
</P>
<P>
   And last week the Vatican published a revised Catholic rite for
exorcism, the ancient ritual for expelling demons, reaffirming for
doubters that the Devil does indeed exist and is very much at work
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   More is coming. Later this year the Vatican will publish an
updated martyrology, the list of the 10,000 or so recognized saints
and martyrs.
</P>
<P>
   All these practices are subjects of debate among Catholics and
between Protestants and Catholics. Since the Second Vatican
Council, which concluded in 1965, the church has sought to shift
emphasis from some of them. Liberal Catholics are uneasy about
religious customs that appear to reflect older, legalistic
approaches to achieving salvation. The Protestant Reformation
disdained the cult of saints, and many Catholics are uncomfortable
with the idea of indulgences, which appear to offer a shortcut to
heaven. Most of all, though, talk of driving out demons evokes for
many images of ``Rosemary's Baby'' and ``The Exorcist'' rather than
profound spiritual values.
</P>
<P>
   As the pontificate of 78-year-old John Paul II enters its third
decade, the Vatican appears to be pursuing divergent goals. The
mandate of the Second Vatican Council to bring the church up to
date has been taken seriously. But at the same time, John Paul
clearly rejects wholesale change. He clings, for example, to the
notion of priestly celibacy just as firmly as he bans even
discussion of the ordination of women.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Vatican, under his aegis, continuously enacts lesser
changes designed to make ancient customs compatible with the spirit
of the times. The Vatican struggles, experts say, to take into
account the sensibilities of a widely varying membership in broadly
differing societies.
</P>
<P>
   In recent decades, Catholics have faced wrenching changes, large
and small. ``Whatever happened to Limbo?'' older Catholics may ask.
The church once taught that it was the place where unbaptized
infants went when they died. It's still around, goes the new
thinking, but it's empty. It is now believed to have been the state
of natural bliss enjoyed by the just, like Abraham and Moses, who
died before the Ascension of Christ to heaven. The Ascension
brought them to heaven as well, and the babies got there too.
</P>
<P>
   Many familiar symbols of devotion, like the scapular, once worn
around the necks of millions of schoolchildren, are much less
common now. Pieces of wool encased in plastic with iconic pictures,
scapulars were believed to confer spiritual benefits much like
indulgences. Some varieties were supposed to insure salvation if a
person died wearing it.
</P>
<P>
   But exorcism, rather than fading away, has seen a revival among
a segment of Catholics. Though ancient and widespread, the practice
of exorcism and belief in demons are, for many Catholics, more
science fiction than reasoned spirituality. The vast majority of
Catholic theologians, said Fordham University sociologist Michael
Cuneo, regard exorcism as ``utter foolishness.'' The Vatican
itself, in proposing the revised rite, took pains to draw
Christians away from notions like those spread in popular
literature and films like ``The Exorcist,'' while at the same time
holding firm to belief in devils.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a PR man for the Devil,'' said the Rev. John Navone,
a Jesuit theologian at the papal Gregorian University in Rome.
``But belief in higher spirits is pre-Judaic and pre-Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   Partly, the Vatican's reaffirmation of the Devil and exorcism
may be designed for the church in developing countries, where
belief in spirits is widespread. ``Christ's victory is power over
those spirits to protect people, so you don't have to live in
fear,'' said the Rev. Thomas Reese, editor of America magazine in
New York. ``In that case, declaring Christ's victory over Satan is
a sign of hope rather than fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even in countries that view themselves as sophisticated,
like the United States, there is a flourishing market for exorcism.
``People are looking to be delivered of demons of alcoholism,
demons of marital infidelity, demons of depression,'' Cuneo said,
``and exorcism winds up the quick-fix solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, there was one official exorcist in the American
Catholic church; now there are 10. In addition to official
exorcisms, many such rites are performed clandestinely, he said,
often by priests ``with traditionalist leanings.'' And the renegade
exorcists are every bit as vexing to the Vatican as are attacks on
belief in spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Vatican again urged bishops and priests not to
confuse psychological suffering and possession, and to seek medical
help while at the same time offering spiritual consolation. ``You
rule out the possibility of an organic problem, of hysteria,''
Cuneo said, ``and this is consistent with a long line of Vatican
thinking.''

WHILE I WAS GONE 
By Sue Miller. Knopf. 266 pp. $24. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the promises of middle-aged wisdom is that you will enjoy
the capacity to understand the idiocy of youth. For parents, this
hard-won insight holds a special kind of irony; still, nobody who
lives beyond the age of recklessness gets away unscathed. Jo
Becker, the protagonist whose moral reckoning is at the center of
Sue Miller's novel, has been doubly enlightened: She's the mother
of three just-grown daughters, and she managed to survive the
emotional and psychic bedlam of the 1960s. Having traded in the
confusion of her 20s (and of Cambridge, Mass. in 1968) for the
steadfast predictability of a reasoned, pastoral life, she's a fall
from grace waiting to happen. Jo's story relies upon the peculiar
blend of darkness and intuition that often belongs to Miller's
fiction, and when her past comes back to haunt her, it does so with
the eerie, long-fingered reach of history _ the sense that what you
did Wednesday will nearly always matter tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I Was Gone'' is a riveting novel, which isn't to say
that it's always a good one. It possesses the dramatic allure of
Miller's better work, ``The Good Mother'' and ``Family Pictures,''
and it showcases what is probably Miller's greatest asset: her
ability to construct a grainy, close-focus portrait of her
characters, both in relation to each other and in their interior
lives. But the road from here to there isn't always easy: awkwardly
conceived scenes, forced dialogue, indefensible comma splices
galore. For all her talents, Miller can be a leaden stylist, and
her shortcomings are actually unnerving in someone of such
emotional depth. That said, the cumulative force of events in
``While I Was Gone'' propels the novel to a convincing close. And
the story it tells _ one of moral consequence and the indelible
stamp of time _ grows deeper as it heads toward its inevitably
shadowy conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Now 52, Jo lives with her husband, Daniel, in a small town in
Western Massachusetts, the last of their girls having just flown
the nest for college. She's a veterinarian in Adams Mills, he's a
minister; together, they've probably treated most of the lost sheep
in their extended flock. It's the kind of life that seems enviably
rich and quiet from the outside: an old farmhouse with dogs at the
door and risotto in the kitchen, work that matters, a gentle
partner you can talk to (and go fishing with) for the rest of your
life. But the story opens with Jo's disconcerting moment of
near-prescient estrangement on an otherwise pristine afternoon, and
whether the storm clouds are actual or projected, her foreboding
makes the Beckers' shared life seem all the more precious.
</P>
<P>
   When a woman shows up at Jo's office a few days later with her
husband's dying dog, Jo realizes she knew the man 30 years ago _
they both lived in a group house in Cambridge, in the days when the
doors went unlocked and the strains of marijuana and bad guitar
went unchecked. His name, Eli Mayhew, is too distinctive to belong
to anybody else; so are his scientist's credentials, which in the
ensuing three decades have made him a renowned biochemist. Eli
himself returns to Jo's for the somber task of euthanizing his dog,
and the intensity of that encounter sets in motion a renewal of the
friendship _ and of the memories that made them both flee the scene
of what Eli remembers as ``a rotten decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the bucolic tints of Jo's present life, she had to
stumble around first to find her way; when she met Eli and the
other members of the Cambridge house, she was running away from a
naive (and short-lived) marriage to a medical student in
Philadelphia. She landed in Cambridge with a waitress job and a new
name, whimsically produced, she believed, as evidence of a new
life. Her strongest connection in the Cambridge house was to a
gorgeous, free-spirited young woman named Dana Jablonski _ Dana,
who loved Jo but didn't quite trust her, who seemed to love
everyone a little too desperately, and whom Jo found late one night
stabbed to death in the living room. The murder was never solved.
</P>
<P>
   Or forgotten, needless to say, though Jo has done a good enough
job of making it recede until Eli reappears. Now the link to her
past _ to the hope and chance of youth _ as well as to what was
probably the worst night of her life, Eli quickly becomes a
mesmerizing presence in Jo's otherwise ordered existence. What she
chooses to do with this specter of history will become the dance at
the center of ``While I Was Gone,'' both in its action and in its
thematic overtones. Risking everything for a nostalgic version of
what may never have been, Jo has to confront her own failings as
well as the fraudulent rewrites of history. It's hardly a pretty
story, but Jo's reliving of it affords her the chance to realize
that her current world is built on bedrock, rather than the smoke
and mirrors of memory.
</P>
<P>
   Through this prismatic reality Miller achieves a number of
lovely relational choreographies. With his gentle restraint and
abiding quiet, Daniel is in line for being the finest character in
the novel, as well as the finest man; the mother-daughter torments
and glories, particularly between Jo and her wild child, Cass, are
evocatively rendered. Few contemporary writers can be so fiercely
candid and acute as Miller about the emotional fear-rides of
parenting, or about the payback for living through it. And Daniel's
faith, while hardly contagious to his wife or daughters, provides a
semblance of sanity (and a moral reference point) within the realm
of private suffering that life often presents. These strands are
part of the design of Eli and Jo's reconnection, and they help
weave a resolution that, for all its sadness, is still testament to
the examined life.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes the clunkers of ``While I Was Gone'' that
much more incongruous. Several veterinary scenes seem more
dutifully researched than heartfelt; some of the dialogue wouldn't
make it through a Miller fiction class; and certainly the idea of a
``homicide department's cheerful office,'' gallows humor
notwithstanding, seems laughably oxymoronic. Jo's attraction to
Eli, however irrational or rooted in the past, happens with a mere
flick of punctuation. Such problems don't usually belong to a
writer of Miller's experience, and for that reason alone they feel
gratingly thoughtless, or at least ill-considered. Still, ``While I
Was Gone'' has an emotional resonance that grows on you, and that
outlives its more specific flaws. Youth itself may be wasted on the
young, but the harsh facts of moral redress _ the repercussions of
love and hate _ are something we usually get to live with the rest
of our lives.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When New York City Police Commissioner Howard Safir announced a
tough new plan in January to seize the vehicles of drunk drivers,
he might have had a talk first with Dick Weart.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Weart was the ombudsman for the federal
government's zero-tolerance drug crackdown. From his desk in
Washington, he fielded frantic telephone calls from customs
inspectors all over the country who had just turned up a few
marijuana seeds or the burnt end of a marijuana cigarette in a car
or boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the phone from seven in the morning to seven at
night,'' he recalled. ``There were times when I was pulling my hair
out.'' Every case, it seemed, had extenuating circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Such crackdowns have been highly popular with politicians and
law-enforcement officials, but after the the klieg-light hype, the
programs are usually quietly dumped or throttled back.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government's program, a model of the genre, was
announced in 1988 by Customs Service Commissioner William von Raab.
``There will be no mercy,'' he vowed. And for a while, that seemed
to be true. His inspectors, sometimes with the help of the Coast
Guard, confiscated thousands of cars and boats from people caught
with small amounts of drugs, regardless of whether they were the
owners.
</P>
<P>
   But within 18 months, the program had been revised three times,
evolving into a relatively lenient approach in which people were
cited and released without any confiscation of their property.
(Federal agents still use forfeiture laws, but mostly against large
scale drug dealers and money launderers.)
</P>
<P>
   It was a chaotic time, Weart recalled. ``The simplest incident
could evolve into something very serious,'' he said. One incident
involved a college student who had driven his father's Ferrari to a
party in Mexico, he recalled. Trying to reenter the United States,
the student realized that the small amount of marijuana in the car
might be enough to get it seized. So he tried to evade inspectors
by roaring through the Customs entry lanes. ``It matured into
something very serious,'' Weart said, including charges of
marijuana possession and endangering a federal agent.
</P>
<P>
   When applied to boats, the policy seemed to exaggerate the
disparity between the seriousness of the crime and the severity of
the punishment. Within weeks of the introduction of the policy,
authorities had seized the Ark Royal, a $2.5 million yacht, after
finding less than one-tenth of an ounce of marijuana on board.
</P>
<P>
   Not long afterward, federal agents confiscated the country's
premier research vessel, the Atlantis II, owned by the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, because the Coast Guard
had found a tiny amount of marijuana in a crew member's shaving
kit. The boat was not formally returned to Woods Hole for two
months.
</P>
<P>
   And a multi-million-dollar vessel owned by the Scripps
Institution of Oceanography in California was seized after dogs
found a small amount of marijuana hidden in the berth of a
low-ranking crew member.
</P>
<P>
   Those and other high-profile seizures brought as much attention
to the zero tolerance, as criticism. But notwithstanding the
problems, Weart said, the program sent a strong message. It pleased
criminal-justice conservatives, but enraged scores of motorists and
boat owners _ not to mention civil libertarians _ who made the same
criticisms that are now being raised about New York's policy. They
complained that such Draconian steps entangle law-enforcement and
court personnel in time-consuming wrangles when they could be
better deployed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Since the nation's earliest years, federal authorities have used
forfeiture laws to seize the property of people who violated
Customs and tax laws, said Sandra Guerra, a professor at the
University of Houston Law Center. Later, they were used against
people who made liquor during Prohibition, she added. But in
applying the law to drunk drivers, she said, officials may be
imposing a punishment disproportionate to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts said the crackdown may never make it through the
New York courts. ``I think people who drive drunk and hurt people
should be punished,'' said Steven Kessler, a New York lawyer and an
expert on asset forfeiture in the state. ``Unfortunately, the
Administrative Code as written doesn't permit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir defended the program, saying that seizing the vehicles of
drunk drivers means taking a weapon out of the hands of potential
criminals. ``I can't tell you how many times I've been to the scene
where somebody was killed, and the drunk driver had been arrested
three or four times before,'' he said. ``Nothing is perfect,
nothing is going to solve the problem totally, but we believe this
is a very good start.''
</P>
<P>
   The policy would be administered ``reasonably,'' he said, and
exceptions will be made when drunk drivers are operating someone
else's car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are lots of people who will think twice about
drinking and driving if they think they are going to lose their
car,'' he said. ``I really do.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With great confidence and some justification,
Republicans have long proclaimed that theirs is the party of ideas.
So it seemed quite a turn when Rep. Steve Largent, R-Wash., in the
Republicans' response to the State of the Union address, found
himself having to pose this question: ``What does the party of
Lincoln and Reagan stand for today?''
</P>
<P>
   The question confounds Republicans at every gathering. At a
meeting of the national party the other day, Jim Nicholson was
re-elected chairman not because he had a fresh agenda. Rather, his
backers persuaded party members that _ as the person who nominated
him put it _ it was not his fault that ``we lack a coherent
message.''
</P>
<P>
   Even former House Speaker Newt Gingrich conceded in a speech in
January that after his party recaptured the House in 1994, ``we
were not able to create a second agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   For a generation, Republicans have been the tribune of a
resurgent American conservatism. Republicanism not only brought
electoral success, it changed the way Americans thought of their
government and of themselves. There were divisions in the party and
tensions between social and economic strains of conservative
thought, but nobody doubted that Republicans had an agenda or that
the party's world view was ascendant.
</P>
<P>
   Now, suddenly, the definition of conservatism is up for grabs.
With the budget balanced, crime down, the welfare rolls and divorce
rates shrunken under a Democratic president, the line between
Democrats and Republicans can be hard to find. So Republicans find
themselves defined by impeachment, by their argument that the
president represents a nation in moral decline and must be removed.
Republicans have found that Americans are leery of a party that
appears to be pressing for moral cleansing _ whether it is about
Clinton, abortion or the rights of homosexuals _ and may be
offended by the notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason Republicans seem so headless is because they have
this enormously important issue in front of them _ the impeachment
of the president _ but they don't want to acknowledge that it is
their most important issue,'' said David Frum, a conservative
theorist in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, he said, Democrats have an advantage because
Clinton's pragmatic politics fit the public mood. ``This is a very
conservative age, but not in an ideological sense,'' Frum said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have embraced Clinton's popular notion that people do
not want grand schemes as much as practical solutions to smaller
problems. (It is no accident that the man who wants to succeed
Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, recently unveiled a slogan of his
own, ``practical idealism.'')
</P>
<P>
   That leaves conservatives competing to reinterpret
Republicanism, to try to make it popular again. The struggle is
complicated because, as the 2000 campaign gets underway,
presidential candidates are molding their appeals to the narrow
base that is important in the primaries while Republicans in
Congress are trying to fashion their own post-impeachment agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Like Democrats, Republicans are a big, messy, contradictory
coalition. While many in the party agree on a broad set of issues,
the challenge is settling on which to emphasize. Here are three
approaches:
</P>
<P>
   Moralists
</P>
<P>
   Social conservatives such as former Education Secretary William
Bennett and Gary Bauer, a prominent Christian conservative who is
running for president, think the party should be unapologetic about
emphasizing its outrage at Clinton's behavior and what they see as
the nation's moral decline. In polls, Republicans are consistently
viewed as having higher ethical standards than Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But the danger is that beyond hard-edged conservatives, many
voters wince at the notion of politicians dictating moral behavior.
After years of accusing Democrats of being wedded to big
government, Republican proponents of a moral crusade risk appearing
as if they are espousing government as a means of enforcing a moral
code. Clinton and his advisers are mindful of polls showing that
over the last two decades, more and more Americans _ Democrats
included _ have come to favor a more limited role for government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachment and the trial of the president seem to be their
unifying theme right now,'' said Paul Beck, chairman of the
political-science department at Ohio State University. ``But there
is this curious contradiction: Republicans are saying, `Let's get
the government out of your pocketbook and wallet but into your
bedroom.' The public may be thinking, `Who are you to tell us what
the standards of morality should be?'''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists
</P>
<P>
   These Republicans believe that the party should stick to its
bedrock issues _ shrinking government, fighting crime and cutting
taxes _ while neither emphasizing nor ignoring touchy social issues
like morals and abortion. They argue that the party has faltered
not because these issues are no longer winners, but because the
party has not pushed them aggressively enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key for us now is to lay out a clear agenda that focuses
on our core issues: tax cuts, smaller government, welfare reform
and strong defense,'' said Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind. ``The
problem we had in the last election was it looked like we were
abandoning those ideas to simply focus on an impeachment vote.''
McIntosh warned: ``We shouldn't be drawn into fights that the
president wants. In health care, he will always have a
better-sounding proposal if we accept his premise that the
government should run the health-care system.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-REPUBS-IDENTITY-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &QL; 
WASHINGTON: health-care system.'' &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In their State of the Union response, Largent and Rep. Jennifer
Dunn, R-Calif., infuriated many moralists who are indignant about
Clinton's conduct; the lawmakers played down the scandal and
underscored the bedrock Republican issues. ``Our country is not in
crisis,'' Ms. Dunn said. ``There are no tanks in the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Innovators
</P>
<P>
   They argue that Republicans cannot simply repeat the party's old
rallying cries. ``Anybody who says that the Republicans should run
on welfare reform or on balancing the budget or having a
middle-class tax cut has a backward view,'' said Jeff Bell, a
conservative thinker. ``You have to move to a daring set of
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   That means the party cannot be timid about playing on Clinton's
turf. From Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin to John Engler of Michigan,
many governors have sought to play down divisive social issues.
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who is considered the leading
presidential contender should he run, has tried to put a friendly
face on traditional party issues with the term ``compassionate
conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Mueller, a conservative public-relations operative, cited
polls suggesting that the party can broaden its appeal among
blacks, Hispanics and Catholics by pushing tax breaks for sending
children to private schools. ``A lot of Republicans are chicken to
talk about Social Security, education and health care, where these
have the potential to be positive issues for Republicans,'' Mueller
said. And they are too quick to cede those matters to the White
House, he said. ``There's a mentality that we don't have the bully
pulpit.''
</P>
<P>
   These competing strains are reminiscent of what Democrats
endured in the 1970s and 1980s, when the outspoken left wing
prevented its leaders from settling on an agenda they could ride to
the White House (except for Jimmy Carter's razor-thin victory in
1976.)
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Sosnik, one of Clinton's closest aides, argued that
confusion is inevitable for any party that does not have a
president to rally around. ``No leader has earned the right to tell
the rest of the people in the party what it means to be a
Republican,'' he said. Many Republicans say the same thing _ and
pin their hopes on the prospect that their party will be rescued by
a popular, charismatic standard bearer in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   That may be wishful thinking. The last two Republican nominees,
Bob Dole and George Bush, failed to sell a new definition of
conservatism. The man who succeeded was Bill Clinton.

<P>
   FRAMINGHAM, Mass. _ So far, Colleen Breitbord's Y2K stockpile
includes extra flashlights and bulk macaroni packages. She's also
in the market for a wood-burning stove in case, as some fear,
blackouts keep her furnace from running on Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   All this has brought some ribbing from neighbors more sanguine
about the next new year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to consider her sensible!'' said James Bennett, a
finance professor at the University of Massachusetts at Boston who
lives next door to Breitbord in Framingham. When Breitbord offered
to buy his pile of firewood recently, Bennett declined, but pledged
to share if their lights go out. ``Maybe we'll be over there on New
Year's Day, toasting marshmallows,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whose expectation proves more accurate 11 months from now,
Bennett's or Breitbord's, will depend on work now under way by an
army of computer programmers and systems managers around the
region. Their labors will determine whether computerized devices
that run everything from power grid substations to celluar phones
and traffic lights operate normally next year.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called millennium bug problem can be described simply,
but solutions for avoiding computer breakdowns are complex.
Essentially, the turnover from 1999 to 2000 may confuse software
that uses the last two digits of each year to keep track of the
date. That means some systems might interpret next year's ``OO'' as
the year 1900, causing them to malfunction or shut down.
</P>
<P>
   The glitch is fixable, but only if technicians find problems in
time. Organizations are spending hundreds
</P>
<P>
   of millions of dollars to check the codes and chips that run
everything from water-system computers to bank machines.
</P>
<P>
   A Globe survey of large institutions around New England suggests
many have made progress tackling the problem. AT&AMP;T Corp. says it
already has prepared systems considered ``mission-critical'' _
meaning those needed to keep its main product, long-distance
service, available after the date change. Gillette Co. says it has
finished 90 percent of its basic work.
</P>
<P>
   Banks like Fleet Financial Group Inc. and State Street Corp.
plan to have their crucial software updated by mid-year. Also, just
in case problems arise next New Year's Eve, both banks have already
reserved blocks of downtown hotel rooms to keep technical staffers
nearby. State Street manager Scott Wellington has apologized in
advance to employees for imposing the holiday overtime but said the
bank will host parties to maintain morale. ``They'll be
non-alcoholic, of course,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   A few firms like BankBoston Corp. declined to quantify their
progress, worrying that such disclosures could expose them to
liability if their assessments prove incorrect. Other repondents to
the Globe survey, often mid-sized organizations with less money to
pay for speedy Y2K reviews, are lagging. The Massachusetts
Municipal Wholesale Electric Co., for example, which provides power
to 34 small communities, won't complete its reviews until Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even if the bulk of Y2K work lies ahead, public officials
appear comfortable with the preparations of critical service
providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm most worried about things like a storm or a localized
power outage on Jan. 1, things we can't control,'' said Val
Asbedian, a state information technology officer.
</P>
<P>
   Asbedian has attended meetings at which other planners have
discussed the possibility of calling out National Guard units to
help keep order at the end of the year, a step several states are
formally considering. But Asbedian said Massachusetts officials see
no role for troops yet. ``It's something we've talked about; it's
part of a normal planning process,'' he said. ``Frankly, if we
activated them, I don't know what they would do.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last month, much public discussion of Y2K focused
on gloomy talk of power blackouts and other disruptions that would
send the economy into recession or worse. Utility and banking
regulators began pressuring those industries to be more forthcoming
about their Y2K preparations.
</P>
<P>
   The attention seems to have accelerated remediation efforts.
Earlier this month, Boston Edison and Northeast Utilities said they
would miss a June 30 industry deadline for the Y2K fixes. But both
have advanced their completion schedules, following concerns raised
by US Energy Secretary Bill Richardson. Edison now says a software
supplier will complete its work earlier. Northeast Utilities
declined to discuss the change.
</P>
<P>
   At a technical level, the painstaking reviews of millions of
lines of computer code fall to specialists like David Chang, vice
president at Primeon Inc. in Burlington. A software engineer
himself, Chang supervises Primeon employees who have audited
programs for about 50 banks and other financial services firms. He
terms the process ``mathematical and intuitive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot just read the code, you have to follow the logic''
of the program, Chang said. ``You could read every line of code
every day and still you won't find what might go wrong. You have to
look at the whole'' of the program.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one Primeon employee reviewing an insurance-company
program found it recorded dates as groups of two digits
representing month, date and year. But the program could also read
the date in a different order: year, date and month. While meant as
a shortcut, the feature could result in the shutdown of the
company's billing system on either Jan. 1, 2000 or on Jan. 1, 2001.
Primeon is still working on the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any professional can find most of the problems when you look
at the codes,'' Chang says. ``But the last 5 percent are the code
problems that are very idiosyncratic.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum are the Y2K reviews of basic
devices like the digital clocks that control most of the 10,000
traffic lights in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Most should work fine come Jan. 1, according to distributors
like Ocean State Signal Co. of Smithfield, R.I. The clocks used in
the firm's traffic lights track only the time and day of the week.
That enables the signals to switch from their green-yellow-red
sequence to flashing modes on nights and weekends.
</P>
<P>
   But as is often the problem with so-called ``embedded systems,''
agencies like the Massachusetts Highway Department lacked records
to see whether every traffic light operated the same way. So last
fall the agency sent engineers to open up the control cabinets for
each of the 1,052 signals it maintains. Along with several rat
nests, they found 32 different control mechanisms from
manufacturers who couldn't be located or are no longer in business.
With no one to vouch for those lights, they will be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're playing it safe,'' said Russ Grant, an
information officer for the agency. It expects to spend $7 million
on such fixes and on upgrading its central computers. The MBTA
expects to spend as much as $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Private-sector outlays dwarf those figures. Bell Atlantic will
spend as much as $550 million by Jan. 1; Raytheon Co. expects to
spend about $180 million. Planners say Y2K-related uncertainties
justify the costs. Even a brief disruption can cause staggering
losses. A two-week strike against United Parcel Service in the
summer of 1997 hit many sectors of the economy and resulted in an
estimated $2.5 billion in lost wages and salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Even with massive expenditures, most large organizations say
there are no guarantees against Y2K breakdowns, mainly because they
rely on many smaller suppliers and vendors, each of which must also
solve their own Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We depend on other people,'' said Selena Morris, a spokeswoman
for Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of assurances troubles consumers like Breitbord, the
Framingham resident. She worries how the date change will affect
firms she does business with, among them BankBoston and New England
Electric. ``I depend on them on a daily basis and yet these things
are utterly out of my control,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Breitbord goes out of her way to speak with friends about how
they might prepare for Y2K disruptions. More formal citizen groups
have met in Lowell and other communities to discuss potential
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Mogil, who runs a nonprofit philanthropic group and
has organized Y2K meetings in Arlington, said he sees a silver
lining in the talk of disaster: the threat will encourage neighbors
to get to know each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to need to count on the people around us,'' Mogil
says. ``Even if we have the foresight to stock up on generators and
it turns out we need them, there won't be enough to go around and
people will be coming to visit. So let's get to know each other
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, what happens may depend on thousands of unsung
officials such as Mark Brewer, deputy executive director of the
agency that operates T.F. Green airport in Warwick, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's task is to oversee the airport's new terminal building
and make sure all its systems function together after the date
change. He has letters from makers of elevators and fire alarms
assuring him the equipment will run as designed.
</P>
<P>
   The letters have not eased his concerns. He said tests have
found that ``when you roll the date forward on the fire alarm
system and pull the lever, yes it rings. When you push the elevator
button, yes it works. But tie the two together, and sometimes
they're finding it doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the plight of every organization trying to contain the
Y2K bug: There are no quick solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer has already ordered more tests. ``Last week I would have
said we're well on our way,'' he said. ``We're still well on our
way, but now I recognize there is a new dimension we have to
address.''

ASCENDANT A DECADE AGO, EUROPEAN CONSERVATISM IS NOW IN DISREPUTE

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ If the waning years of this decade have produced a
dirty word in Europe, it is perhaps ``conservative.'' The
right-of-center ideology that played an important role in stripping
European states of vast industrial holdings, advancing the market
economy and facing down the former Soviet Union with medium-range
missiles has fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, conservatives were in charge or on the rise in
most places in Europe, but today there is hardly any country where
that is true. In Germany, France, Britain and Italy, moreover,
parties of the right are in disarray, casting around for a
persuasive electoral message at a time when such traditional
backbones of conservatism as ``the nation,'' ``the family,'' ``the
church'' and ``the communist enemy'' have changed or lost their
meaning and the moderate left has occupied the political center.
</P>
<P>
   Learning from Bill Clinton, center-left politicians like British
Prime Minister Tony Blair and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
have seized the political initiative with white-toothed smiles and
cleverly spin-doctored images of modernity, economic efficiency and
social compassion. In response, amid peace and moderate prosperity,
the right has found itself clutching at straws.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these right-wing parties cried `Victory' as the Berlin
Wall came down, but they did not see that they had lost the force
against which they defined themselves,'' said French political
scientist Pascal Perrineau. ``And they have been unable, since
then, to come up with a message that does not seem regressive,
nostalgic, outdated.''
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, the right has two essential incarnations: the
free-market ideology once embodied by Margaret Thatcher in Britain
and the more socially conscious conservatism of the German
Christian Democrats, among others.
</P>
<P>
   At the root of the problem for both, it seems, lie two victories
that seemed to assure the right's future. One was over communism
and the division of Europe, the other over the excesses of
state-run economies.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of these triumphs, the specter of Marx and the spur
of the market lost their potency as conservative rallying cries.
</P>
<P>
   The effect has been devastating. In Italy, the Christian
Democrats, long the main center-right party and bastion of
U.S.-backed efforts to block communism, simply disintegrated.
Elsewhere, the right abruptly found itself in a world dominated not
by strategic blocs but by the economic forces of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   And Europeans, in large numbers, reacted to global free-market
forces not with outright enthusiasm but with calls for safeguarding
and even reinforcing their social-security systems.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that these systems are often too expensive to survive
indefinitely in their present form. Politically, a message that
pays has been one that says: Rely on us to protect you from
cutthroat capitalism, displaced factories and global storms. In a
Europe of high unemployment, the left has proved nimbler in
purveying this slogan than the center-right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear of an unstoppable global economy dislocating
societies has been hard for the right to exploit because it has
generally stood for free markets and non-interference,'' said
Jonathan Eyal, a British analyst, ``And the new centrist left
quickly occupied the broad election-winning ground: acceptance of
the market tempered by social concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Deep changes in the very nature of European societies have also
militated against the right. Appeals to the family and to tradition
often seem outmoded, or in need of recasting, in countries where
single-parent homes have become commonplace, divorce rampant,
church-going more unusual and a multicultural environment the norm.
European conservatives, like their American counterparts, have
denounced such changes, but the response from the European
electorate has been muted.
</P>
<P>
   The German weekly Die Zeit recently observed that ``the
middle-class entrepreneur of the 1950s who wanted his children to
inherit his company regarded the linkage of business and family
values as something quite natural.'' That attitude, it added, no
longer prevailed for ``the owner of a bunch of shares.'' And so,
``the links between the market and morality, between ownership and
middle-class values, which were embodied by the Christian
Democrats, are strained and ready to burst.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, are the links that long bound the right to patriotic
visions of the European nation state. The fact is that this year's
introduction of a common European currency, the euro, marked the
biggest voluntary and peacetime surrender of sovereignty by a group
of states in history. Center-right parties are still grappling with
the enormity of this shift. For what should a conservative message
be in a Europe where nations exist in name but rather less in
substance?
</P>
<P>
   An answer appears elusive. In France, no less than seven
right-wing political groupings are putting forward candidates for
European Parliament elections later this year. They include three
pro-European movements, two anti-European centrist groups, and two
nationalistic platforms from the now-splintered extreme-right
National Front. ``It's mad,'' said Pierre Lellouche, a Gaullist.
</P>
<P>
   But the madness reflects real differences. Some Gaullists favor
European integration; others equate it with the end of ``la
France.'' That is a very basic divergence to accommodate within a
single party.
</P>
<P>
   On the extreme right, both Jean-Marie Le Pen and his challenger,
Bruno Megret, call for the rebirth of ``national values'' and
attack ``the disappearance of European races through general
miscegenation.'' But such messages, while they rouse 15 percent of
French people, do not win elections. They help divide the right.

BERLIN: the right. &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, where the 16-year era of Helmut Kohl ended last
year, Kohl's Christian Democratic Party has been organizing a
petition to contest the Schroeder government's plans to introduce
new citizenship laws that would allow many of the country's 7
million foreigners to become Germans. Behind the petition, a
nostalgia for a certain idea of the German nation clearly lies, one
where only German blood gives the right to nationality. Also
evident is real hostility to the ideas of what the right calls the
``multicultural left.''
</P>
<P>
   But, again, it is far from clear that this sort of initiative
can win what Eyal called ``the critical broad church of the
center.'' For Germany is now a mixed society, like it or not.
</P>
<P>
   So, what to do? Clearly, in Britain and Germany the thirst for a
change after long periods of right-wing rule has played a big role
in the popularity of center-left parties. But the success of the
center-right prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, in Spain, after
years of socialist rule suggests there is nothing irreversible
about the right's decline.
</P>
<P>
   David Willetts, a Conservative member of the British Parliament,
said the key to success lay in underlining the themes of freedom
and prosperity against the ``more regulated economy and nannying
government'' put forward by Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Lellouche, the Gaullist, said the right must renew its
leadership and unite around the themes of toughness against crime,
strong defenses, skepticism about immigration and economic
deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, conservatives have suggested all sorts of themes:
personal responsibility, ecological concern, radical economic
reform favoring initiative over social protection. But for the
moment, the Christian Democratic Party is plainly at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one powerful example of a successful conservative society
exists: the Bavaria fashioned by Edmund Stoiber, the leader of the
Christian Social Union, the Christian Democrats' sister party.
There, unemployment is 7 percent, compared to a national average of
more than 10 percent, high-tech companies are thriving, prosperity
is widespread, and Stoiber never tires of extolling beer-swilling
``Bavarian traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon may well be peculiarly Bavarian. But Horst
Teltschik, who served as national security adviser to Kohl and is
now on BMW's board, said the message could have a wide appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Mr. Stoiber has done is convince people they are safe at
home and fit for the world,'' he said. ``He has turned Bavaria into
a modern, high-tech state, while keeping its values. People feel
secure, prosperous and ready to look outward: that can win
elections.''

 JORDANIAN HEIR BRINGS TALENTS TO DAUNTING TASK
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ After coming of age in the preppy environs of
Deerfield Academy in Western Massachusetts, he is now a commander
of an elite military unit who spends his free time online at an
Internet cafe, racing cars, parachuting and practicing Tae Kwando.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Crown Prince Abdullah, the oldest son of the ailing King
Hussein and the newly appointed heir to the throne of this desert
kingdom. He sounds straight out of Gentlemen's Quarterly magazine.
And even has the requisite snakeskin cowboy boots.
</P>
<P>
   It is not exactly the profile one would expect of a ruler of a
nation strategically poised between Iraq and Israel. So Abdullah,
who turned 37 Saturday, has a lot to prove as regional fears grow
about the stability of the Hashemite dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   He did not make a good first impression on Friday (Jan. 29),
palace sources say, when his poor command of classical Arabic
became evident in an address to the nation. A crisis looms in
neighboring Iraq, and Abdullah's experience in foreign policy
leaves him ill equipped if it should erupt soon, the sources add.
</P>
<P>
   As one former Jordanian prime minister put it, ``Let's just say
he is untested.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Abdullah will be an accidental king. As his
father's health deteriorated rapidly last week, the oldest son from
Hussein's second marriage was not viewed as a likely candidate for
successor.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Abdullah has had history thrust upon him, he brings
with him considerable strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``He represents a new generation of Jordan to be headed by a new
generation of Hashemites,'' said Sharif Fawaz Shalaf, a former
Jordanian ambassador to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As a young military commander destined to take over Jordan's
armed forces, Abdullah was in close personal contact with soldiers,
and therefore with all levels of Jordan's diverse society. He has a
deep understanding of the nation and a common touch that many
analysts compare to that of his father, according to one former
palace official. The vast majority of Jordan's 3.5 million people
are Palestinian Muslims from the West and East Bank of the Jordan
River. The rest are a mix of Arab and Bedouin Muslim tribes, Arab
Christians, and Circassians, who fled czarist Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah served with soldiers from all of these sectors,
especially the Bedouin tribesmen, who make up the heart of Jordan's
military. And they seem deeply loyal to him, gauging by the palace
reception he held in which thousands showed up to pay their
respects last week. His military experience also gave him the
opportunity to see how economic decisions made from inside the
palace directly affect soldiers' lives. It also gave him an
on-the-ground feeling for the daunting challenges that face him in
improving Jordan's flagging economy.
</P>
<P>
   For 34 years, the erudite and loyal younger brother of Hussein,
Prince Hassan, 51, was expected to take the crown. When rumors
surfaced two weeks ago that Hassan was out, palace watchers
believed 18-year-old Hamzah, eldest of Hussein's three children
with his fourth wife Queen Noor, would be made king.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah himself, insiders say, was surprised when he was made
heir to the throne just 12 hours before the king left for a
last-ditch effort to treat his lymphoma cancer. It seems the
decision came down to a matter of timing. Hussein's illness did not
give him enough time to make the constitutional changes needed for
Hamzah to succeed him. So he opted for Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   Fahed Fanek, one of Jordan's most influential commentators and
palace observers, said, ``He will rule very differently from his
father. . . . Jordan needs a king who will become more symbolic,
and less of a decision maker. The whole situation tells us that
Abdullah will help make the transition to a more democratic,
constitutional monarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   Another important asset for Abdullah is his wife. In 1993, he
married Rania Yassin, a Jordanian of Palestinian origin. Her
potential reign as queen is warmly welcomed by Jordan's Palestinian
majority who believe it will keep Abdullah attuned to the ties that
link Jordanians and Palestinians in their dealings with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah and Rania have two children, a 4-year-old son, Hussein,
and a 2-year-old daughter, Iman. Abdullah, like his father, had a
reputation as a wild man, but he has toned down in recent years,
especially since his marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah's mother, Toni Gardiner, was the daughter of a British
army officer working in Jordan. In 1960, she converted to Islam,
and became King Hussein's second wife. They were divorced in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah was sent off to boarding school in England at age 4.
But he spent most of his youth in the rolling hills of Western
Massachusetts, attending Eagle Brook Academy and then Deerfield
Academy. He graduated in the class of 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Deerfield instructor Charles Danielski taught the young prince
biology and describes him as an ``okay, but not spectacular''
student.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked hard, he was an enthusiastic kid,'' said Danielski.
</P>
<P>
   His American accent and his poor command of classical Arabic are
serious issues for the crown prince. A brief televised address
Friday to a meeting of Arab interior ministers was the first time
many Jordanians heard him speak.
</P>
<P>
   John Stobierski, a classmate who is now a lawyer in Greenfield,
played on the Deerfield football team with Abdullah. ``He was
small, but tough. Kind of a fireplug,'' says Stobierski.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of his favorite pastimes was trying to lose the Secret
Service guys,'' says Stobierski, referring to the US agents who
shadowed him.
</P>
<P>
   After Deerfield, Abdullah, like his father, attended Britain's
Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. Brief stints at Oxford and
Georgetown University followed, although he has no degree from
either.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of the crown prince has been met with some private
reservations by Jordan's palace watchers. But Stobierski said, ``I
think he'll surprise people. There's a lot of substance there.''

 N.H. KEEPS EYE ON ITS PRIMARY, HOPES OTHER STATES BLINK
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Crowded by California, dogged by Delaware,
and rushed by the Rocky Mountain states, this first-in-the-nation
primary state is waging a war of nerves.
</P>
<P>
   And that's leaving prospective presidential candidates _ such as
Arizona Senator John McCain, who was here Saturday; Bill Bradley,
who visited last week; and Vice President Al Gore, who will come
Wednesday _ in the lurch. None of them knows when New Hampshire
will hold its 2000 primary.
</P>
<P>
   Neither, for that matter, do the hotel managers, who will have
rooms filled with journalists, politicians, and campaign aides. Nor
do the networks, who must book fiber-optic lines, equipment, and
hotel rooms. Even party officials here aren't clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's in February of 2000, I'm not sure,'' ventured
Kathy Sullivan, the incoming chairman of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Duprey, the GOP chairman, just laughs at the confusion:
``I know exactly when the New Hampshire primary is _ whenever the
secretary of state says.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bill Gardner, the unassuming and long-serving secretary of
state, is not saying. That's because New Hampshire is fighting for
its survival as a deciding force in presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner wants to see when other states set their primary and
caucus dates before he sets a date for New Hampshire. The goal: to
stay far enough ahead of the pack to ensure the state's primacy, as
well as its influence.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner said he won't make an announcement until sometime in the
fall. And he is quick to point out that autumn does not officially
end until winter begins on the 21st of December. In 1995, Gardner
did not announce the date of the 1996 primary until Dec. 20th.
</P>
<P>
   He may have some additional help sheltering the primary from the
other states. Representative Jim Splaine, the Portsmouth Democrat,
has introduced a bill to allow Gardner to move the primary ahead of
any other state by more than seven days if need be. Currently,
Gardner has the authority to move it precisely seven days ahead of
other primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Splaine said he wants to give New Hampshire some breathing room
from the two dozen other states crowding right behind. And he said
the beauty of the low-cost, person-to-person New Hampshire
tradition will be undermined if candidates have to be ready to
immediately compete in so many other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to give'' Gardner ``more flexibility and encourage
other states to lay off,'' Splaine said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, New Hampshire has pulled back its primary date
to avoid sharing the spotlight with other upstart states. From 1920
to 1972, the primary was always held the second Tuesday in March,
the same as the state's town meeting day.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1976, Massachusetts and Vermont tried to create a
regional primary by stepping on New Hampshire's turf. Instead, New
Hampshire jumped back to the fourth Tuesday in February.
</P>
<P>
   When South Dakota chose the last Tuesday in February for its
primary in 1988, New Hampshire retreated again. In 1988, 1992, and
1996, the Granite State chose its presidential favorites on the
third Tuesday in February.
</P>
<P>
   Now, New Hampshire and Iowa are in cahoots, ready to pick even
earlier dates to fend off the encroachment attempts by Delaware and
Michigan. Traditionally, Iowa's caucuses are followed eight days
later by New Hampshire's primary.
</P>
<P>
   In Delaware, the Republican chairman said it is ``upsetting''
and ``unfortunate'' that Gardner is trying to obstruct his state's
right to piggyback on New Hampshire with an unannounced, early
primary date.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need to set a date as quickly as possible so all
the candidates and campaigns can know when the primary is,'' said
Basil Battaglia, the Republican Party chair. ``There's no sense in
penalizing the campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, two state legislators want to change their primary
date from March 21 to the second Tuesday in February. And Senator
Carl Levin, a Democrat, wants to hold a Michigan presidential
caucus on the Saturday before New Hampshire's primary to end ``the
stranglehold'' that Iowa and New Hampshire have on the nominating
process.
</P>
<P>
   But the candidates won't necessarily follow.
</P>
<P>
   Representative John Kasich, the Ohio Republican, has vowed not
to campaign in Delaware for fear of hurting New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iowa and New Hampshire are the keys for anyone not born a
millionaire,'' said Kasich, the son of a postman, during a
fund-raising trip to Boston last week. ``They don't care who you
are _ they want to know what you're all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates, with the exception of former Tennessee
Governor Lamar Alexander and publisher Steve Forbes, have signed
pledges promising not to campaign in Delaware. Delaware's law says
its primary shall be held four days after New Hampshire's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could move so far ahead that Delaware wouldn't want to
follow us,'' suggested Hugh Gregg, the former Republican governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a number of people who say we're not going to vote for
anyone who's going to Delaware,'' he said. ``We feel very, very
strong about this primary up here.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the candidates, the people who are most affected by the
unscheduled schedule are the hotels and the television networks.
</P>
<P>
   At the Center of New Hampshire Holiday Inn, general manager Sean
O'Kane is in the midst of a juggling act that affects thousands of
other people. The hotel is the central headquarters for the
candidates, the campaigns and the journalists covering the primary.
Room reservations for the 2000 primary have been booked for the
last year and a half. But the exact dates for those reservation
have not been set.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we book those other conventions unrelated to the
primary if the primary date is a moving target?'' asked O'Kane.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 1,000 college students are planning to attend a
conference in the third week in January. If the primary is moved
back much further, the hotel has the right to bump the students,
according to a special contingency clause in their contract.
Altogether, O'Kane said, he has six or seven other groups who may
lose out due to the shifting primary date.
</P>
<P>
   For the television networks, the situation is slightly less
dire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We deal with uncertainty in planning big events all the
time,'' said Mark Halperin, ABC News's political director.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he said, is the cost of covering the contest. ``If
it stays uncertain right up to the deadline for some of these
things,'' Halperin said, ``it could end up costing more.''

<P>
   So it has come to this. The essay, the great literary art form
that Montaigne conceived and Virginia Woolf carried on, that the
writer Edward Hoagland likens to jazz or a butterfly's flight, has
sunk to a state where someone thinks it is a bright idea to ask a
computer if an essay is any good.
</P>
<P>
   The new computer, which is called e-rater (sort of like
In-Sink-Erator, the company that makes machines to grind up kitchen
garbage), will be used along with a trained human to grade the two
essay questions on the Graduate Management Admission Test taken by
200,000 business school applicants each year.
</P>
<P>
   E-rater's interest is not exactly that of Addison and Steele or
E.B. White. Humor is outside its jurisdiction, as are irony and
surprise. E-rater likes subordinate and complementary clauses and
words like ``however'' and ``therefore'' that some people think
suggest a tidy mind.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when essays were thought to be more than the
sum of their therefores. They were distinguished by their
originality, insight and personal voice, by their graceful style,
lack of affectation and willingness to meander. Instead of stomping
toward a conclusion, many never arrived.
</P>
<P>
   A genuine essay is ``the movement of a free mind at play,''
writes novelist and critic Cynthia Ozick; it is ``a stroll through
someone's mazy mind.'' The essayist is free ``to hop from thought
to thought, to begin with the finish and finish with the middle, or
to eschew beginning and end and keep only a middle.''
</P>
<P>
   A century ago, Samuel Johnson and other great essayists were
used as models to teach theme writing in schools. But in the
factory of freshman composition, the meaning of ``essay'' has
eroded to a point where it is almost equivalent to any old hunk of
prose. As a result, shortly after Robert Atwan started editing his
annual book series, ``The Best American Essays'' (Houghton
Mifflin), a dentist sent along an article on root canal that he had
published in a dental journal and said was the best essay he had
ever written.
</P>
<P>
   The telltale signs of a bad essay are at least as familiar as
the virtues of the great ones. There is the obligatory ``thesis
statement,'' Atwan says. Then come three paragraphs of exposition,
then a concluding paragraph summarizing the preceding three, along
with the phrase ``Thus we see that . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has to forget the school essay before they can
write,'' said Ian Frazier, the writer. ``They have to forget `not
only but also' constructions. That's dead. Nobody wants to read
that, not even teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter the e-rater.
</P>
<P>
   The impulse behind e-rater was not, of course, doing Max
Beerbohm one better. The idea was to cut costs, among other things.
Instead of two people grading each essay, the Graduate Management
Admission Council, which administers the test, could have one
trained human and one machine.
</P>
<P>
   And what a machine! E-rater is ``the most highly developed,
holistic electronic writing assessment application to date,'' said
Frederic McHale of the admission council. It is a computer bulked
up on a high-protein diet of high-scoring answers to past
admission-test essay questions.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Burstein, a scientist at Educational Testing Service in
Princeton, N.J., who led the team that invented e-rater, says the
computer looks for what she called syntactic variety, such as
different kinds of clauses. It also looks for words associated with
organization of ideas, such as ``first,'' ``second'' and ``third.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not trained to score Montaigne,'' she said. ``It's not
designed to score creative writing and irony and metaphor and
poems. It's designed for a specific purpose, to score the kinds of
essays we see on standardized tests.''
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible (therefore!) to say how Montaigne might have
fared. He never did have to analyze the annual report of Olympic
Foods or agree or disagree with a statement like, ``Nations should
cooperate to develop regulations that limit children's access to
adult material on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Much business writing seems to aspire to little more than
lowest-common-denominator order and clarity. And, with home
computers already editing for gender neutrality and pointing out
when sentences exceed 31 words, why not let e-rater be the enforcer
of corporatese?
</P>
<P>
   ``For business letters, I think it's OK,'' Ms. Ozick conceded in
an interview. ``On the other hand, this is no way to teach somebody
to think. If an essay represents thinking at its purest and most
original, this is a terrible template to put over the human mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Frazier, however, said he understands the impulse. Strangers
keep cranking out manuscripts on computers and shipping them off to
him. ``It would be great if one machine wrote it and another
machine read it,'' he said, ``and we would all be free to go about
our business.''

   EVERETT, Mass. _ A former guard at a notorious Bosnian Serb
prison camp has settled with his family in Everett, stirring
intense debate among Bosnian refugees over whether he was an
accomplice to ``ethnic cleansing'' or in fact used his position to
help victims of the slaughter in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   No evidence has surfaced that Jezdimir Topic, 56, participated
in atrocities that occurred at Trnopolje, one of three camps around
the city of Prijedor in northwestern Bosnia where thousands of
Muslims and Croats were raped, tortured, and executed during
systematic efforts by the Serbs to drive them from the region in
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Topic's defenders acknowledge that he worked at the camp, armed
and in uniform. But they said he actually tried to help victims of
the Serbs and finally fled with his family because of the mass
killing.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that Topic had not disclosed his background as a
guard, the Immigration and Naturalization Service said after a
Globe inquiry that it would investigate his case.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Topic nor his family would be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Dragana Zubcevic, a family friend who escaped the Serb siege of
Sarajevo in 1992, said Topic and his family have been getting death
threats from other Bosnian refugees who, she said, have no evidence
but are looking for a villain.
</P>
<P>
   Zubcevic said Topic, whose wife is a Muslim, ran away from his
guard position after risking his life in attempts to save his
wife's family and other Muslim friends.
</P>
<P>
   However, three former prisoners at Trnopolje identified Topic as
a guard who offered no help to them, and they said they never saw
him help others. The former prisoners, each of whom had known Topic
for decades and confirmed his identity from a photo provided by the
Globe, said that rather than offering assistance, Topic refused
even to recognize them.
</P>
<P>
   Tesma Elezovic, 51, said she spotted Topic immediately in August
1992 when she and 30 other women were transferred to Trnopolje from
Omarska, another brutal camp run by the Serbs. She said Topic was
dressed in a Serb military uniform, carried an automatic rifle, and
was standing next to the camp commander, Slobodan Kurozovic, who
was later indicted on charges of committing atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked toward us and then he turned his back,'' said
Elezovic, who lives abroad but asked that her location not be
revealed. ``Then Slobodan told them to register us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jadranka Cigelj, an ethnic Croat who said she grew up on the
same street as Topic and has known him since she was 8, also said
Topic did nothing when he saw her, even though ``I looked like a
long stick with two eyes and some teeth at the top'' after losing
46 pounds in 54 days at Omarska. ``He pretended he didn't see me,''
she said bitterly during a telephone interview from Zagreb,
Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoners at Trnopolje slept outside or on a crowded
concrete floor in a converted elementary school. They ate
infrequently, they said, sometimes going days without meals while
under constant threat from Serb soldiers.

<P>
   ``He thought he could just move away, move to Boston and come
away clean as a whistle,'' said Nusreta Sivac, 48, of Bosnia, who
also said she knew Topic long before the war. ``His attempt to run
away is not successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Farquharson, Boston district director of the INS, said
Topic's file contained no information indicating he had disclosed
his experience as a guard at Trnopolje before entering the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he did not divulge'' such associations to immigration
officers overseas ``it would be a very serious, major consideration
in revoking his refugee status and resulting in his removal from
the United States,'' Farquharson said. ``If all of this is
verified, this gentleman is going to face the serious prospect of
having his refugee status revoked.''
</P>
<P>
   Topic is at least the second Serb to turn up in the United
States whose actions in the war have been called into question.
Last year, Nikola Vukovic, a former Bosnian Serb soldier charged
with frequently beating Muslim and Croat prisoners with metal
pipes, bats, and other objects, was discovered living in suburban
Atlanta, working for a company that makes compressors for air
conditioners and refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   Four of Vukovic's alleged victims have sued him in US District
Court in Atlanta, accusing him of genocide, torture, and other
crimes against humanity. Vukovic has denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Roberts, counsel for the San Francisco-based Center for
Justice and Accountability, which helped file the suit, said the
group has received unconfirmed reports of other Serbs living in the
United States who may have been involved in human rights abuses.
Serbs accused of having a role in so-called ``ethnic cleansing''
operations also have surfaced in Canada, Germany, Switzerland, and
Australia as part of the mass exodus of refugees that followed the
war in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Topic and his wife, Muniba, who works for the International
Rescue Committee helping to resettle Bosnian refugees, live with
their two grown daughters in a neat, two-family house in Everett.
</P>
<P>
   Zubcevic, the family friend, said Topic's ``children shake every
time the telephone rings because callers say they will kill their
whole family. They question why his wife is working when he is a
murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like to talk about our past,'' Muniba Topic said in a
conversation on her front porch two weeks ago. ``Here we live, we
work, we enjoy it.''

   AMMAN, Jordan _ Everyone knows that Shakespeare artfully used
royal intrigues and jealousies to weave tales almost dizzying in
scope. But however much he invented dialogue and situations, people
have always suspected that when it came to the motives and
character of kings and queens, Shakespeare got it right. He showed
royalty to be larger than life, but in the end very human.
</P>
<P>
   Now, from the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, comes evidence to
support that proposition: a most extraordinary document in the
voice of a modern-day king struggling with his own mortality as he
grapples with issues that were the stuff of the 16th century.
</P>
<P>
   The document is a letter sent Jan. 25 by King Hussein of Jordan
to his brother, Prince Hassan, the longtime heir to the throne. It
was written in Arabic and distributed in translation by the royal
palace. In pained but regal tones, often blunt and sometimes
rambling, the letter reveals the intensely personal nature of the
king's decision about who should succeed him. It also shows what
went into that choice: grand strategy, pride, respect for law,
emotion, the weight of tradition and rumors of treachery.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, absolute power has always been lonely _ King
Hussein's own 1962 autobiography was titled ``Uneasy Lies the
Head.'' And of all the responsibilities a king has, choosing the
next king may be the heaviest. Consider the case of a predecessor
across the Jordan River, the biblical King David, who chose not his
eldest son, as would have been customary, but Solomon, the son of
his favorite wife.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-four years ago, King Hussein too bucked convention by
designating his brother Hassan as crown prince, and until last week
that decision seemed unshakable. But as he tells Prince Hassan in
the letter, he questioned that choice as he lay ill with cancer
last year in the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. When Hussein returned to
the kingdom, he made his choice known. Then he returned to
Minnesota for more cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In the king's telling, it is an epic tale.
</P>
<P>
   The cast of characters: Hussein, the gravely ill King of Jordan;
his 51-year-old brother, Hassan, who had ruled the land as regent
for six months; Hussein's eldest son, Abdullah, about to turn 37;
Hussein's fourth and current wife, Queen Noor; Hussein's younger
son, Hamzeh, 18; various unnamed court figures and
behind-the-scenes plotters.
</P>
<P>
   _ By DOUGLAS JEHL
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Hassan was designated crown prince in 1965,
when the king's own oldest son was 3 and the country was in peril:
(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   I entrusted you with the post of crown prince and I was, with
the will of God, responsible for that decision at the time, at a
time when the eldest son of the King has not reached the age
defined by the constitution to allow him to assume responsibility
in case the king had died by the will of God.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, a dark atmosphere was affecting the whole nation
because dangers, rumors and speculation were rife concerning the
imminent end of Jordan, a country with a mission, principles and
morals, and a true affiliation to the Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
   (END ITALICS HERE)Over time, the king had heard of words
directed against him, from within the crown prince's own circle.
But he could not believe that his brother would have been disloyal.
(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   My small family was offended by slandering and falsehoods, and I
refer here to my wife and children. When I heard this most of the
time, I attributed it to the tendency towards rivalry among those
who pretend to be faithful to you.
</P>
<P>
   (END ITALICS HERE)Fie on those who had tried to stir jealousies
within the family! (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   I have lived through many experiences and I noticed at an early
age how some some climbers climb onto the branch to ruin the
relation between brothers and between father and son, and I swore
to myself that this would not happen here in my lifetime. But
surely, this has become the objective of every declared or hidden
enemy, and all of those who have used all means at their disposal
to weaken confidence between leadership and people, but they have
not succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Of course, the king himself had been above
the plotters' machinations: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Their plan at this stage, together with those who want to
destroy Jordan, was to instigate infighting in the ranks of the
leadership after they failed to dismantle the base, and they find
in my being alive an impediment to all their designs, forgetting
that Al Hussein has lived only to gain the blessings of God, to
have a clear conscience and to achieve the best for all his people,
regardless of their origins, who cooperate in holding the banner
high and carrying the message of Jordan with their heads high, not
bowing except before God.
</P>
<P>
   (END ITALICS HERE) He had truly intended to honor his
commitment, but a question lingered: If his brother were to succeed
him, who would next become king? (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   I was determined to hand the first responsibility to you, but
after you, I envisioned a role for the family council in which to
ensure the unity of the Hashemite family, so that when the time
came for you to choose your successor, the family would have a
great role in naming the most suitable successor, in accordance
with the benevolent traditions of Islam.

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The king wanted a voice in choosing that
next heir, but his brother had seemed deaf to the proposal: (END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   We differed over [the council) because your opinion was that it
should be achieved only when you were at the helm. I placed between
your two hands a few papers that I wrote myself. I did not show
them to anyone. They consisted of the main tenets of my proposal,
and when I received your comments on them, the response did not
reflect the spirit of my proposal, nor did they meet the needs of
the times.
</P>
<P>
   We have differed, and we still do, over the succession, and who
would succeed you. You were completely opposed to this until the
time you would have assumed the throne and decided who would have
been your successor.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The king's sons were now grown, and among
them was a favorite. (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Hamzeh, may God give him long life, has been envied since
childhood because he was close to me, and because he wanted to know
all matters large and small, and all details of the history of his
family. He wanted to know about the struggles of his brothers and
his countrymen. I have been touched by his devotion to his country
and by his integrity and magnanimity as he stayed beside me.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) And then, after the king fell ill, his
brother began to seem vaguely distant: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Of my family, at the forefront was my brother Mohammed and my
sister Basma, who visited me and donated marrow that matches my
own. You also volunteered to donate marrow except that yours did
not match mine.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The plotters had grown bolder, zeroing in
on the American-born Queen Noor. (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   She brought happiness to me and cared for me during my illness,
with the utmost loving affection. She, the Jordanian, who belongs
to this country with every fiber of her being, holds her head high
in the defense and service of this country's interest. She is the
mother who devotes all her efforts to her family. We have grown
together in soul and mind, and she has had to endure a great deal
of hardship to ensure that I was being attended to. And she, like
me, also endured much anxiety and many shocks, but always placed
her faith in God and hid her tears behind smiles. She also has not
escaped the attempts of criticism. Why not? (Because there are)
climbers who want to reach for the summit, and when the fever was
getting high some people thought it was their chance.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) And then, while the crown prince acted as
regent, there had been improper interference: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   I have intervened from my sickbed to prevent meddling in the
affairs of the Arab army. This meddling seemed to be meant to
settle scores, and included retiring efficient officers known for
their allegiance and whose history and bright records are beyond
reproach.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Finally, the king had asked his brother to
await a decision on his fate: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   I have received the letter in which you place the matter of
succession between my hands, and in which you express your
readiness to hear my decision concerning that matter. I thank you
for that.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) So, to the unkindest cut: Hassan is
deposed. Long live Abdullah bin Hussein! (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   I have found that to take a decision, I must refer to the
original constitutional rule, where I find that all conditions that
originally dictate the exception [to the rule of selecting the
king's eldest son as heir) have passed, and that therefore, His
Royal Highness Prince Abdullah would, in such a case, immediately
assume all duties as Crown Prince of the Hashemite Kingdom of
Jordan.

<P>
   When a reporter came to the side door recently after Topic was
observed on the street, the younger of his two grown daughters,
Arijana, answered. She said her father does not speak English and,
in any case, ``we don't want to discuss'' his role in the camp.
</P>
<P>
   Topic has been in Massachusetts since at least 1995, when he
obtained a driver's license. His presence in the Boston area
continues to be a matter of deep dispute within the 1,100-member
Bosnian refugee community in Massachusetts, among refugees
elsewhere, and among officials and advocates concerned with
immigration and human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
   The camps at Trnopolje, Omarska, and Keraterm symbolized some of
the gravest abuses of a war that enveloped thousands of innocents
in its inhumanity and gore. According to indictments issued by the
International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the
camps were established for the specific purpose of killing Muslims
and Croats, or so frightening and abusing them that they would flee
the area around Prijedor. The Trnopolje camp was the largest of the
three, and was the one to which most women, children, and elderly
people were taken and confined with minimal shelter and inadequate
sanitation and food.
</P>
<P>
   Trnopolje ``served as the staging point for the mass deportation
of all those who survived the initial attacks and camp regime,''
tribunal investigators found in a genocide indictment issued
against a Serb leader in 1997. ``It also served a much more
sinister purpose: the sexual assault, rape, and torture of many of
the women detained there by camp personnel. . . . In many instances
the women and girls were taken from the camp and raped, tortured,
or sexually abused at other locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition, many prisoners both male and female were killed,
beaten, and otherwise physically and psychologically maltreated by
the camp personnel and other Serbs. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   One survivor of Trnopolje, who was in the camp from May to July
1992 and asked not to be identified, said 20 to 30 uniformed Serbs
normally were stationed there to control about 3,000 detainees. She
said that made it impossible for guards to be unaware of the
outrages that were being committed.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions were relatively better at Trnopolje than they had
been at Omarska, said Cigelj, who spent five days at Trnopolje in
August 1992. ``Trnopolje was a four-star hotel compared to Omarska,
even though people were constantly beaten,'' she said. ``Life was
worth nothing in either camp, absolutely nothing, but in terms of
gradations of horror, Omarska was worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Elezovic said that even though she lost 77 pounds at Omarska,
the Serbs gave her just one meal _ a watery soup flecked with meat
_ after she arrived at Trnopolje. She spent the rest of her stay
eating bread and a few pieces of macaroni given to her by other
prisoners who acquired the food when relatives were allowed to
bring it to them.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about Topic initially were raised within the refugee
community about two years ago. Rita Kantarowski, director of the
office, said after the IRC became aware of the Topic issue ``we
followed it up with the community'' by holding a meeting at the
agency's office. The concerns raised ``did not have anything to do
with the person who works here,'' Muniba Topic, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kantarowski said some people at the community meeting said Topic
did help detainees in the camp, but she was unable to say whether
anyone who was not a family member gave such testimony. ``I am
satisfied with the research I have done . . . that there is no
basis'' for disputing his refugee status, Kantarowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Zubcevic said Topic told her that he would have gone ``crazy''
if he had remained at the camp, and fled because of the killing he
witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very good person,'' Zubcevic said. ``He cried once
when he explained how the Serbian army had killed women and kids.''
</P>
<P>
   But camp survivors and other critics said Topic is now making
excuses for his complicity in killings at the camp. They said that
Topic, then in his late 40s, was under no obligation to join the
military and they asserted he must have been fully aware of the
Serbs' grisly tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who are responsible because they committed
war crimes and there are those who are responsible because they did
nothing to prevent them,'' Cigelj said, adding that she believes
Topic was in the latter group. ``All those people who put on a
uniform are responsible for letting this type of political program
surface and flourish.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Zakim, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League,
said it is important to learn the truth about Topic because
``identification and eventual prosecution sends a message to the
people who are there now that `you will be held accountable.' I
hope that would send a shiver down the spines of people who are
there committing atrocities today.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always have a ready excuse that they had no choice, or
that they tried to help,'' Zakim said. ``It's the oldest one in the
book. People who perpetuate atrocitiesz. . . often depend on the
apathy or silence of people who consider themselves mere
bystanders.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Cigelj said, some soldiers did help some prisoners, but
she said she never saw Topic do that.
</P>
<P>
   Sivac said that even soldiers who tortured prisoners were known
occasionally to perform acts of kindness. She said the deputy
commander at Omarska, who since has been indicted, once brought her
a small package of cigarettes and toiletries. ``That helped me,''
she said, ``but he was responsible for the death and torture of
hundreds of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Cigelj, a lawyer and political activist, said Topic's inaction
seemed worse considering she had known him most of her life. She
described Topic as a friendly, unassuming, slightly arrogant man
who went by his childhood nickname, Giga. He and his wife were
elementary school teachers before the war, she said, adding that
during their childhood, her family shared a home with the family of
Topic's best friend, so she saw Topic often.
</P>
<P>
   After identifying Topic through his photo last week, she said,
``I couldn't believe I would see the day when someone would send me
a photo of Giga and I would have to confirm that he was a person
who participated in something like this, where other people were
hurt. It's very difficult to face something that was part of your
childhood and then see it in this light.''

   Pope's Plea for Clemency Spares Prisoner's Life
</P>
<P>
   When the ailing Pope John Paul II briefly visited St. Louis on
his fifth U.S. trip, high on his agenda was to urge the nation's
often restless Roman Catholics to follow Vatican teaching more
closely. In a special plea, he called the death penalty ``cruel and
unnecessary,'' even for ``someone who has done great evil.'' And he
didn't balk at specifics, asking Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan to
spare the life of Darrell Mease, a triple murderer set to die Feb.
10.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan, who has approved 26 executions in six years, commuted
Mease's sentence to life in prison. ``I was moved'' by the pope's
concern, Carnahan said, though he stayed firm in his support of
capital punishment.

   NATO said it was prepared to bomb Serb military targets and take

   A Warning on Social Security
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to shore up Social Security is to use the
federal budget surpluses now anticipated by both parties. But
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned Congress and the
administration that the surpluses are not a sure thing. If
Washington really wants to be sure of putting the retirement system
on a sound footing, Greenspan said, it will probably have to do it
the old fashioned way, through politically painful tax increases
and benefit cuts.

   First U.S. Hand Transplant
</P>
<P>
   Surgeons in Louisville, Ky., performed the first hand transplant
in the United States, and the world's third. The recipient of the
donor hand was Matthew David Scott of Absecon, N.J., who lost his
own in a firecracker accident in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The rarity of hand transplants largely reflects an ethical
controversy over the benefits of a procedure that is not essential
to life and results in a lifelong need for anti-rejection drugs,
which can lead to infection and other illnesses. But if recipients
regain sufficient use of their new hands, such transplants might
become more common.

   Newswoman Wins Bias Case
</P>
<P>
   Janet Peckinpaugh, once the top-rated anchorwoman in
Connecticut, had set out to become an avenger for women denied the
chance to grow gray on the air. Instead, a federal jury in Hartford
found that the city's CBS station had let her go because of her sex
_ not her age _ and awarded her $8.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict resulted from the station's ritual pairing of a man
and a woman at the anchor desk, a practice as basic to local news
as zippy music and cheery banter. In 1994, Ms. Peckinpaugh's
station had a stable of three anchorwomen and two anchormen, and
wanted to cut that to two pairs. Witnesses said the women had to
audition, while the men had a free pass. Ms. Peckinpaugh, now 48,
became the odd anchor out.

   Introducing La Nina

   El Nino, the big pool of warm water that appears from time to
time in the tropical Pacific and disrupts weather patterns around
the world, became a household word a year ago. Its opposite number,
La Nina, which makes the tropical Pacific colder than normal, may
be less familiar but is solidly in place now, Federal scientists
say, altering atmospheric circulation in a different way than El
Nino did.
</P>
<P>
   Among the results, they say, have been record snows in Buffalo
and Chicago, record numbers of tornadoes in the nation's
midsection, all-time low temperatures in Indiana and Maine and an
extremely wet and unusually warm second half of January in New
York. La Nina is expected to stick around until May or June.

   Ford Buys Volvo Car Unit
</P>
<P>
   Henry Ford took pride in building Model T's that the common man
could afford. But the market for basic transportation is
increasingly unprofitable as manufacturers in places like South
Korea churn out lots of cheap cars. So Ford Motor Co. has announced
that it will also try to become a larger maker of luxury cars by
buying the car operations of Sweden's Volvo for $6.45 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said it would keep Volvo's research, design, management and
much of its manufacturing in Sweden, and would not change the cars.
Ford gives its luxury divisions a lot of independence. How many
Americans know that Ford has already bought Jaguar and Aston-Martin
in the last decade?

   Monday it's February. If traditional patterns hold, half the
people who resolved Jan. 1 to stick to an ambitious exercise regime
will have relapsed into guilt-encrusted sloth.

words, don't rush to quit the gym, but if you do, there are
moderate alternatives.

   U.N. Cautioned on Iraq
</P>
<P>
   As the Security Council tried to decide how to keep Iraq from
re-arming with nuclear, biological or chemical weapons, the body
created to disarm the nation, the United Nations Special
Commission, delivered a lengthy report full of cautions about
taking Saddam Hussein at his word.
</P>
<P>
   Unscom's report detailed how over almost eight years Iraq has
consistently lied, changed stories, destroyed evidence and
obstructed inspections under a concealment policy written by top
officials. Russia, Iraq's strongest supporter, wants Unscom
abolished. The United States wants to preserve something akin to
the status quo.

   Olympic Scandal Widens
</P>
<P>
   The fallout continued from the biggest corruption scandal in
Olympic history as the International Olympic Committee expelled six
members for receiving improper benefits in the bidding for the 2002
Winter Games in Salt Lake City. A seventh member resigned, another
was given a warning and three remained under investigation in the
scandal, which involved the receipt by some members of cash and
gifts totaling an estimated $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's executive board also recommended an overhaul of
the system of bidding on the Games.

   The Growing Lexicon of Offense
</P>
<P>
   Another word died last week, said Sol Steinmetz, a New York
lexicographer.
</P>
<P>
   Washington was in an uproar about whether the new mayor was
right to accept the resignation of a white aide who had offended a
black colleague by using the word ``niggardly.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Anthony Williams said the aide, David Howard, had used
poor judgment even though the word has no racial links; it comes
from a Scandinavian word for ``miserly,'' which predates the slur
it sounds like by several hundred years. (Now the mayor is in
trouble with some activists who, like Howard, are gay _ another
word that has been through some changes in recent years.)
</P>
<P>
   After the smoke clears, there will be agreement on one thing,
predicted Steinmetz: ``No one is going to risk using that word
now.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, linguists are finding an expanding list of benign words
shunned because they either sound offensive or might otherwise be
misconstrued.
</P>
<P>
   Chicanery _ deception by trickery, from the Old French chicaner,
to quibble _ is sometimes avoided as an affront to Hispanics
because it closely resembles the word chicano. Terms like queer the
deal, chink in the armor and nip in the air are also on the wane.
</P>
<P>
   Another phrase in full retreat is ``to call a spade a spade,''
first used by Plutarch and once synonymous with ``to call a bucket
a bucket'' _ meaning to call things by their true names or to be
straightforward to the point of rudeness.
</P>
<P>
   Not all misunderstandings involve such sensitive matters as race
or ethnicity, of course. And some perfectly innocuous-sounding
words have acquired a bad reputation unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Sheidlower, senior editor in the Random House reference
department, said ``picnic'' has recently come under suspicion
because of an untrue story that it refers to parties in the
countryside where black children were ``picked'' and assaulted.
(The known parentage of the word goes back to mid-18th-century
French pique-nique, but beyond that, its roots are unclear.)
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want to accept the fact that some words are of
unknown origin,'' Sheidlower said. And that's how rumors about
words get started.

   With Sweets, It's Nurture, Not Nature
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, scientific studies have demonstrated what
everyone else has always known: Women love chocolate. In study
after study, women rate this most irresistible of sweets as their
No. 1 food craving. So intense is this peculiarly female devotion
that scientists have suggested a woman's burning desire for
chocolate might have a biological basis. Researchers have even
suggested that opiates or other chemicals in chocolate thought to
be capable of mimicking the brain chemistry of a person in love
might be what makes women reach for that extra truffle.
</P>
<P>
   But the days when science provided sweet comfort for female
chocolate addicts may have ended. According to a study to appear
later this year in the journal Appetite, researchers report that
not all women are so obsessed. Spanish women who crave sweets were
considerably less attached to chocolate and no more enthralled by
it than Spanish men.
</P>
<P>
   The reason that American women adore chocolate, researchers
suggest, is that people tend to crave and enjoy familiar foods.
American women, drowning in a chocolate-saturated culture, can't
help but learn their naughty little addiction.
</P>
<P>
   So why don't American men go wild for their Ghirardelli as well?
Researchers suggest that in a culture in which gals pop bonbons and
guys carve up steaks, chocolate, along with quiche, may be one of
those foods that real men just won't eat.
</P>
<P>
   This theory also suggests that women could, by repeated
exposure, teach themselves to crave other foods instead, like
sweetened rice cakes. Until researchers come up with a more
palatable hypothesis, women chocoholics will have to seek
reassurance elsewhere, possibly the nearest chocolate shop.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The cameras were yanked, the lights unplugged and
the doors slammed against the public and the press last week,
leaving the country's premier deliberative body to deliberate by
itself. The Senate had concluded that the only way to resolve
several thorny procedural issues surrounding President Clinton's
fate was to seal itself off.
</P>
<P>
   Though most Democrats voted to keep the sessions open, they
showed little outrage after they lost. And once the sessions began,
some of them dared to see some virtue in the closed-door process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with what Louis Brandeis said: `Sunlight is the
strongest disinfectant,''' said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. ``And
the public has a right to know about things as important as this.
On the other hand, the fact of the matter is when you close a
proceeding, you get more interactive dialogue because people are
just talking to one another, as opposed to talking to a much larger
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., was one of six Democrats who voted
with Republicans to close the discussion on whether to call
witnesses in the impeachment trial. ``Most proceedings ought to be
open,'' he said. ``But I felt there was a capacity in a closed
session for this particular issue to be more frankly discussed and
to become less polarized quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that when the Senate votes, perhaps in two
weeks, on whether to hold its final deliberations in secret,
Democrats will vote to close the doors. But it does recognize the
hazards of governing in the age of television: Politicians love the
camera, but alas, they say, they can't speak freely in front of it.
</P>
<P>
   This produced the conundrum last week of senators popping out of
their closed sessions to say that they were so statesmanlike inside
it was too bad the public couldn't see them. It seemed to matter
little that by the end of the week, whatever understanding had been
reached in private had vanished as a politically cleaved Senate
voted strictly along party lines to take videotaped depositions
from witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   When the Senate first convened in 1789, its members assumed that
they would conduct their business in private. The Continental
Congresses had been closed. The Constitutional Convention had the
windows nailed shut when it met in 1787.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure, the Senate gave way to public sessions; it
changed its rules in 1929 to make secret sessions the exception
rather than the rule. Since then, the Senate has conducted 45
secret sessions, most of them involving national security. The last
three were to discuss the procedures for Clinton's trial.
</P>
<P>
   The real action of governing takes place out of camera range
anyway. Spending bills are drafted in secret, proposals are floated
in private huddles, deals are hatched in hideaways. By the time
these items come up for a vote, most Senators have made up their
minds.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the year, the Senate chamber is a pretty lonely place,
with senators speechifying for the cameras and little real debate.
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., one of only three Republicans who voted
to keep last week's sessions open, said the most amazing thing
about the sessions was not that they were closed but that all 100
senators attended. Normally when a senator speaks on the floor,
Specter said, ``it's like a tree falling in the forest.'' Closing
the doors, he said, forced the rare moment when ``all of your
colleagues are listening.''
</P>
<P>
   Cameras in the chambers only give the illusion of openness, says
Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for
Communications at the University of Pennsylvania. ``We've created a
public arena in which we offer conclusions, but we don't show the
process of getting there,'' Ms. Jamieson said. The question is how
to create a public forum for thoughtful exchange, she said, in
which a politician would not be hurt politically for speaking
frankly, conceding points to opponents or mulling complex thoughts,
which senators say they can do behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   Bound to secrecy on pain of expulsion, senators couldn't say
exactly what they had accomplished last week, but their
generalities demonstrated the gulf between private discourse and
public. ``There were some things that were said on both sides,''
noted Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., ``that you could not have said
if it was in front of the whole country.''
</P>
<P>
   C-SPAN chief executive Brian Lamb disagreed. ``It's a lot easier
for all of us to make decisions behind closed doors,'' he said,
``but I don't see any evidence that this is more efficient or
better. These are very talented, rough-and-tumble people who were
elected in a very open process out there. They ought to be able to
handle it.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Senate meet in private, it did not even debate
why it should do so, sparing members the lasting televised images
of anyone on the floor arguing to exclude the public. This left
Lamb lamenting that the lockout had generated so little concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't care because they're sick to death of the
subject,'' he said. ``They're pounded to death with it every night.
They have heard every argument, watched every possible scenario.
You can see why people are starting to say we have too much
openness. But democracy was never a pretty picture.''

WHERE HAS TRUST GONE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The president, the national role model, is portrayed as a
lecherous liar. The Olympic Games, once held up as a paragon of
global harmony and promoter of world peace, are a cesspool of
corruption. In scholastic sports, where youngsters are supposed to
learn about winning with grace and losing with character, coaches
deflate the scores of blowout games they report to the local
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   What's a person to believe in?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a whole element of civil society that is based on
trust and the norms and values we develop from that,'' says Michael
Johnston, a political scientist at Colgate University. ``People
look at the president or the Olympics and project those values on
distant people and institutions. And when those values are under
assault, it can be a real crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   In times of crisis, we often turn to religion, and studies show
that people who attend church regularly are happier than those who
do not. But here, too, truth fails us: As it turns out, Americans
tend to lie about how often they go to church.
</P>
<P>
   Sociologists C. Kirk Hadaway, Penny Marler, and Mark Chaves
found that many fewer Americans attend church weekly than the 40
percent figure that is commonly reported.``It is more like 22 or 23
percent, a little lower for Protestants and a little higher for
Catholics,'' says Hadaway, a sociologist with the United Church of
Christ. ``We found that most of the people misreporting their
attendance see themselves as weekly attenders, but with the
realities of life, competing things to do on Sunday, that it is
hard for people to show up.''
</P>
<P>
   Some psychologists and social scientists think we are becoming
social hermits _ turning inward to family and friends for our main
source of inspiration, our balm for the daily wounds of the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a kind of retreat from a world that is hard to
understand, is not very friendly, is not very comfortable, but you
have to deal with from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.,'' says Boston College
Sociology Professor David Karp. ``People need comfort, they are
looking for places to find comfort and family and friends are
places where they get it.'' While family, certainly can, at times,
be hard to understand and uncomfortable, the movement inward, says
Karp, even has a name: cocooning.
</P>
<P>
   As defense mechanisms go, it isn't a bad one.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a strong connection between close, supportive
relationships and well-being,'' says David G. Myers, a professor of
psychology at Hope College in Holland, Mich., and author of ``The
Pursuit of Happiness: Who is Happy and Why.''
</P>
<P>
   The three things that are often considered to make people happy
are money, friends, and faith. But having lots of money, Myers
says, does not necessarily make one happier.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it can corrode a sense of values, according to Barry
Schwartz, a Swarthmore College professor of social theory and
author of ``The Costs of Living: How Market Freedom Erodes the Best
Things in Life.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems with the Olympics, Schwartz says, is that since the
1984 Los Angeles Games, which Peter Ueberroth turned into a cash
cow instead of money loser, there's been too much money at stake
for host cities. ``I have a feeling the International Olympic
Committee (which selects the host cities and some members of which
received bribes) was more negligent than avaricious. When there is
that much money floating around, it is impossible to resist, and I
think it is a wonderful example of how markets corrupt things that
we would otherwise value.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington these days, there is talk that a censure of
President Clinton for his sexual involvement with a White House
intern _ considered the likeliest outcome of his impeachment trial
in the US Senate _ could involve a hefty fine. That, says Schwartz,
``would be the worst possible lesson to teach.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, indeed for a year now, Clinton is being punished
with shame. He's being reminded over and over again: You ``
`cheated on your wife, you cheated with a child who worked for you,
you lied to your friends, family, under oath, and to the country.
You are beneath contempt and you are a disgrace and we will fine
you.' Shame is the most powerful of human emotions and it is hard
to imagine anyone being more shamed than Clinton. If you fine
someone, then the shame no longer counts,'' Schwartz says.
</P>
<P>
   It is the idea of a moral compass, a shared sense of what is
right, that helps us cope with the deceit that seems to be defining
the news these days. While religion can help, its reach is limited.
And that, Hadaway says, ``makes the family all that more important
and it also makes the individual and individualism more of a silent
feature of modern society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I am worried about some of these trends,'' Hadaway
says. ``It makes family more important but what are the
alternatives for faith development? You can log on to chat rooms,
the United Church of Christ has a Web site with a prayer chapel,
but those are supplements, not replacements.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been several studies regarding the fraying of
associational bonds, such as Harvard University professor of
international affairs Robert Putnam's 1995 paper titled ``Bowling
Alone.'' It argued that the general trend away from organized
social orgnizations _ like bowling leagues, which experienced a
precipitous drop while the number of people bowling (presumably
with family or friends) increased _ is a ``vanishing form of social
capital'' that made American democracy so strong.
</P>
<P>
   While Jean-Paul Sartre believed that ``hell is other people''
there are plenty of surveys that indicate having friends and being
married make people much happier.
</P>
<P>
   Personal relationships may be under siege from a lack of time,
and half of all marriages may end in divorce, but giving priority
to close relationships is one of the keys to happiness, says Myers.
``There are few better remedies for unhappiness than an intimate
friendship with someone who cares about you.''
</P>
<P>
   Numerous studies indicate that married people are happier and
more satisfied with life, Myers says. For example, a National
Opinion Research Center survey between 1972 and 1994 found that 40
percent of married adults said they were ``very happy'' _ almost
double the percent of ``happy people'' who were never married.
</P>
<P>
   While some might argue that happier and more socially outgoing
people would be more likely to marry, Myers suggests the increased
happiness is primarily due to the beneficial effects of marriage _
``friendship sealed by commitment reduces loneliness and offers a
dependable lover and companion.''
</P>
<P>
   And where but family and friends are youngsters supposed to go
to learn the value of truth, when other traditional sources such as
teachers, coaches, even pastors, have sometimes revealed themselves
to be less-than-honest?
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the changed scores, ``It does not take an ethicist
to point out the dishonesty and lack of integrity in something like
that,'' said Nicholas Dixon, a professor of philosophy and sports
ethicist at Alma College, in Alma, Mich. ``If you can't trust the
score, what can you trust?''
</P>
<P>
   It is not a good thing, Johnston believes, that we are becoming
social hermits with ``half of our interaction with close friends
and family and half with unseen faces on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is too early,'' Johnston said, ``to blow sirens and say `We
have a crisis.' But we should worry about it.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The president of the United States springs the
nation's top communist from jail. Behind the president's back,
America's top spymaster swaps secrets with the Soviets. The
secretary of commerce bares his soul to Moscow's station chief in
Washington. Meanwhile, federal agents are hunting down communist
file clerks and coatholders.
</P>
<P>
   A new book, ``The Haunted Wood: Soviet Espionage in America _
The Stalin Era''(Random House) offers a new look at what communist
spies were really up to in this country before and during World War
II. It is a staggering account of sloppiness and stupidity among
the Soviets and their American agents.
</P>
<P>
   And it underscores how much the most powerful people in
Washington freely gave Moscow when faced with a common enemy in
wartime. On balance, it appears that Moscow gained more from its
open alliances with the United States than from its secret American
underground.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of ``The Haunted Wood,'' Allen Weinstein, the
founder of the Center for Democracy, a Washington foundation, and
Alexander Vassiliev, a Russian spy turned reporter, hoped for
revelations when they burrowed into the archives of the chief
Soviet foreign intelligence service, the KGB, which granted (and
then withdrew) access in exchange for cash from Random House.
</P>
<P>
   Writing the history of war and diplomacy without secret
intelligence files is like building a house without a blueprint:
The angles go awry, the foundation tilts. With the files, history
can outstrip any novelist's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   But not all was revealed.
</P>
<P>
   If the late Alger Hiss indeed spent a decade as a Soviet agent,
as is now generally thought by Cold War scholars, what did he
actually do? No answers came; they may reside in the still-closed
files of another bureaucracy, the Soviet military intelligence
service.
</P>
<P>
   The files that were opened showed that Soviet espionage in the
United States was clearly less than masterful under Stalin.
</P>
<P>
   ``At present we don't have any agents'' in Washington began one
plaintive message from the Soviets' New York station. One Soviet
station chief in Washington spoke no English, which somewhat
limited his ability to move in American society.
</P>
<P>
   Purges and paranoia in Moscow put some of the best operatives in
prison or the grave.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviets did eventually acquire networks of agents in the
United States, some of whom thought they were working for the
Communist Party of the United States and its boss, Earl Browder,
and some of whom realized that their true masters were in Moscow.
The agents penetrated the Justice Department and the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The files show that they even had an agent in Congress: Rep.
Samuel Dickstein, who represented a swath of Manhattan's Lower East
Side and was generally useless to his Soviet paymasters.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike their British counterparts, the American agents of
the international communist conspiracy were ``as sloppy as you can
get,'' Weinstein noted in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Americans working for the Soviets in the United
States eventually were done in by their own clumsiness or betrayed
by their colleagues. The main reason they survived as long as they
did was incompetent (or nonexistent) American counterintelligence
before Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, they did more for Moscow than any spy network.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt granted diplomatic recognition,
which gave the Soviets embassies to use as spy stations in the
United States. And he gave amnesty to Browder, a valued spy for
Moscow who had been jailed for passport fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Then, like so many others, he was purged by Stalin. ( Browder's
downfall alienated a key American spy for the Soviets, Elizabeth
Bentley, who turned informer. Her testimony led to a confession
from another Russian agent, Whittaker Chambers. Chambers later
testified as the key witness in the government's perjury
prosecution of Hiss. In intelligence, as in biology, everything is
connected to everything else).
</P>
<P>
   William Donovan, the head of the Office of Strategic Services,
the wartime spy organization, undertook deep exchanges of
intelligence with the Soviets, sometimes exceeding his instructions
from Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   He even returned to the Soviets a crucial code book captured by
Finnish spies (but he secretly kept a copy, which eventually helped
the United States decode Soviet cables and helped break the Soviet
spy rings).
</P>
<P>
   And Henry A. Wallace, Roosevelt's vice president and Truman's
commerce secretary, had a remarkable breakfast with the Soviet
station chief in Washington in October 1945, offering insights and
seeking support for his political ideas, like placing custody of
atomic weapons with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Had a petty bureaucrat undertaken such a rendezvous and been
caught, he might well have been jailed.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1946, almost every member of the Soviet spy network
recruited in the United States before and during World War II was
out of business. They were disaffected, or they had defected. They
awaited arrest or had already been arrested. They were exiles and
suicides.
</P>
<P>
   While the House Committee on Un-American Activities was setting
up shop, the Soviet station in Washington was a shell, its spies
reduced to clipping newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The ruined lives of those who spied for the Soviets are
testimony to the perfidiousness of intelligence services
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers put it best in describing his testimony against Hiss.
In a letter to a friend, he said, ``It was all for nothing, that
nothing had been gained except the misery of others.''

<P>
   One important lesson of the GOP-driven impeachment trial lies in
how Republicans have manipulated, if not dangerously undermined,
the democratic process as they make their reckless assault against
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   All their rhetoric about following the ``rule of law'' and
``doing our constitutional duty'' is nothing more than a
hypocritical attempt to use their numeric superiority to remove, if
not destroy, a Democratic president duly elected by the people, of
the people, and for the people.

   There is no other way to explain last week's party-line vote
against dismissal of the impeachment charges against Clinton. And
there is no other explanation for how the same partisan vote
occurred on the motion to depose three witnesses: Monica Lewinksy,
Vernon Jordan, and Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties know that right now Republicans have the votes,
thus the power, to approve or defeat any motion, except the one
that counts: to remove Clinton from office. The votes of 56 to 44
against dismissal of the charges, and the vote of 56 to 44 for
deposing three witnesses make it clear that the GOP does not have a
two-thirds majority vote for conviction. That is why the GOP
members of the House and Senate are doing virtually all they can to
achieve their purpose in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate Republicans are hoping that deposing Lewinsky,
Jordan, and Blumethal will result in some explosive new disclosure
that will reverse the public's support of Clinton and give
justification to their removal efforts.
</P>
<P>
   While their chances are less than slim for such a disclosure,
Republicans feel they have nothing to lose with their desperate
attempt to get their witnesses to say something _ anything _ that
lends credibility to their political quest to remove Clinton or
force him to resign. Barring that, they hope to pile on enough
embarrassment so that his eight-year presidency is marked in
history by shame, not achievement.
</P>
<P>
   But the most notable aspect of this impeachment trial is not the
GOP's use of its numeric power against a president they couldn't
defeat at the voting booth. It's the Democratic senators', and the
electorate's, inability to stop or neutralize the Republicans'
assault.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that Senate Democrats may be unable to stop the GOP
from approving a motion that would taint Clinton forever, despite
the expected acquittal vote in the Senate. This motion _ called a
``finding of fact'' but really a conviction without removal _
requires only a simple majority vote, which the GOP has.
</P>
<P>
   This move amounts to an underhanded attempt by Republicans to
skirt the Founding Fathers' constitutional requirement for a
two-thirds vote for conviction. If they are successful, Clinton
will forever be labeled a convicted criminal _ even as he continues
in office _ making unnecessary the original GOP goal of removing
him.
</P>
<P>
   After all, having a president convicted of criminal charges
remain in office is almost as humiliating as having him convicted
and removed from office. Either way, the Republicans get what they
want; Clinton goes down in history as a tainted president for lying
about his sex life with Monica Lewinsky _ regardless of the fact
that this adulterous affair posed no threat to the Constitution or
to America, and thus falls short of true grounds for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for the Democrats, and the electorate, to stop the
GOP's blatant attempt to exploit three thoroughly questioned
witnesses in the hope that at least one will help legitimize their
planned partisan vote on a ``finding of fact'' against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   While the Democrats and the electorate may seem powerless to
stop the GOP, that can change. Since Republicans have made a sham
of the impeachment process, Democrats are justified in going beyond
their verbal protest to a visible, unified, dramatic statement that
would expose this process as the one-sided GOP sideshow it is.
</P>
<P>
   In such a statement, Democrats could say that they will not
participate in any further GOP shams, such as voting on a ``finding
of fact'' that would allow the GOP to label Clinton a ``criminal''
before the actual impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats could further state that the only vote in which
they will participate will be the vote on impeachment. The outcome
of the vote, as the GOP well knows, will be acquittal. Even a few
GOP members are likely to join the Democratic vote against
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   While a censure vote after the acquittal is still likely, it
would be entirely appropriate for the Democrats to argue that the
GOP lost its opportunity for such a vote when it pushed for a
politically-motivated ``finding of fact.'' Then they could simply
walk out of the chamber, leaving Republicans with a meaningless,
one-sided vote on censure.
</P>
<P>
   And that would be an appropriate ending for an entirely
inappropriate, reckless, partisan assault that was more threatening
to democracy and the Constitution than anything that happened
between Clinton and Lewinsky.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is hard to see why economics is called the dismal science
when the title is so much better deserved by evolutionary biology.
</P>
<P>
   For biologists, the human race is being loaded down with bad
mutations, the more so as medical advances thwart the scythe of
natural selection from culling the weak.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing that bugs biologists is sex. Like James Thurber,
they have long asked why it is necessary. Yeah, babies, but you
could make them much more easily by parthenogenesis _ virgin birth
_ the mode of procreation favored by stick insects and other
sensible creatures.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to sexual intercourse, the biologists stand
foursquare with Lord Chesterfield, who advised his son that ``the
pleasure is momentary, the position ridiculous and the expense
damnable.''
</P>
<P>
   The biologists' two interests, doom and sex, have intersected in
a new report that shows there is indeed a purpose to sex: to sweep
away the bad mutations that would otherwise drag us toward terminal
degeneracy.
</P>
<P>
   Two British biologists, Adam Eyre-Walker and Peter Keightley,
came up with an ingenious way of estimating the number of bad
mutations that have flowed in and out of the human genome during
the 6 million years since we and chimpanzees stopped calling each
other cousins. They found that at least 1.6 and probably 3
mutations per person must have been eliminated in each generation.
</P>
<P>
   This is an amazing number when you consider that a mutation can
only disappear through a ``genetic death'' _ when its owner, or
child or grandchild, dies without progeny.
</P>
<P>
   ``That implies three genetic deaths per person!'' said
population geneticist James Crow of the University of Wisconsin in
a commentary on the new study. ``Why aren't we extinct?''
</P>
<P>
   Evidently we manage to beat the odds somehow or other. Last week
Service Corporation International, a major operator of funeral
homes and cemeteries, forecast meager earnings because of reduced
mortality rates, a grim outlook that resulted in a 44 percent
tumble in its stock price.
</P>
<P>
   What magic draught cleanses us of bad mutations without
demanding one life for each?
</P>
<P>
   Now you begin to see how sex works. If we bred like stick
insects, our children would have the exact same faults as their
parents, knowledge of which would destroy all respect between
generations.
</P>
<P>
   In sex, however, life's biggest non-regulated lottery, one's
genes first get shuffled among themselves and a random assortment
is then cut into someone else's deck. Bad mutations get left on the
cutting room floor, or if they combine in a fetus, their
synergistic effect will probably cause a speedy death, eliminating
many mutations at once.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, the gamble of sex beats death. By not acting like
stick insects, we escape extinction. Maybe those evolutionary
biologists aren't such dismal killjoys after all.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Jan. 31, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled for the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   REPUBS-IDENTITY-REVIEW (Washington) _ For a generation,
Republicans have represented resurgent American conservatism. But
now, with the budget balanced and significant reductions in crime,
welfare, divorce and single motherhood, Republicans find themselves
defined by impeachment and their argument that President Clinton
represents a nation in moral decline. They are also finding that
Americans are leery of a party that appears to be pressing for
moral cleansing. By Richard L Berke. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-CONSERVATIVES-REVIEW (Berlin) _ If the late '90s have
produced a dirty word in Europe, it is perhaps `conservative.' The
right-of-center ideology that played an important role in
privatization, advancing the market economy and facing down the
Soviet Union has fizzled. At the beginning of the decade,
conservatives were in charge or on the rise nearly everywhere in
Europe, but today there is not a single major country where that is
true. By Roger Cohen. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   ZERO-TOLERANCE-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``Zero-tolerance'' policies of
seizing cars, boats and other property of persons suspected but not
convicted of drug trafficking or other offenses pleased
criminal-justice conservatives, but enraged scores of motorists,
boat owners, civil libertarians and policy analysts. Critics
complained that draconian steps tie up enforcement personnel better
deployed elsewhere, swamp overburdened administrative systems and
worse, provide little if any deterrence. By David Johnston. (`a'
category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   CATHOLIC-RITUALS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Although resisting major
change, the Catholic Church has been enacting lesser changes in
ritual and practice designed to render ancient religious customs
compatible with the spirit of the times. In much of this, experts
say, the Vatican struggles to take into account the sensibilities
and convictions of a widely varying membership in broadly differing
societies. A recent statement on exorcism is an example. By John
Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   DISEASE-CLUSTERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Disease clusters are
concentrated areas in which an unusually high percentage of people
succumb to some type of illness, possibly caused by local
environmental conditions. Every time a disease cluster turns up,
communities worry, scientists scramble for a cause and, as in ``A
Civil Action'' lawyers start suing. Yet over and over again,
despite years _ sometimes decades _ of efforts to link the disease
with a cause, scientists usually come up empty-handed. By Gina
Kolata.
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL-DEBT-REVIEW (Washington) _ The end of the annual budget
deficit is hardly the end of the government's financial troubles,
and it marks the beginning of a new debate over how fiscal policy
should be used to shape the nation's future. The cumulative the
national debt built up over decades of deficit spending remains an
economic millstone of considerable proportions. And only now do
Congress and the White House have the luxury of debating what to do
about it. By Richard W. Stevenson. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   EARTHQUAKE-HOUSES-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Americans viewing the
devastation caused by the earthquake in Colombia might be tempted
to knock on wood. Wood-frame houses, the type generally built in
the United States, can stand up far better in quakes than the
outwardly solid masonry homes that crumpled so quickly in Colombia.
By Andrew Pollack
</P>
<P>
   SEX-MUTANTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Evolutionary biologists have long
wondered why sexual reproduction took precedence over asexual
reproduction. Now, a new report shows there is indeed a purpose to
sex: to sweep away the bad mutations that would otherwise drag us
toward terminal degeneracy. By Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   SENATE-SECRECY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Much of the Senate debate
during the impeachment trial has been over to the degree to which
the proceedings should be conducted publicly or in closed session.
A look at the background of Senate secrecy and openness. By
Katharine Q. Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER-ESSAY-REVIEW (Undated) _ So it has come to this. The
essay, that great literary art form, has fallen to a state where
someone thinks it is a swell idea to ask a computer if an essay is
any good. The new computer, which is called e-rater, will be used
along with a trained human to grade the two essay questions on the
Graduate Management Admission Test taken by 200,000 business-school
applicants each year. By Janny Scott.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   SOVIET-ESPIONAGE-REVIEW (Washington) _ A new book, `The Haunted
Wood: Soviet Espionage in America _ The Stalin Era,' offers a new
look at what communist spies were really up to in this country
before and during World War II. It is a staggering account of
sloppiness and stupidity among the Soviets and their American
agents. And it underscores how much the most powerful people in
Washington freely gave Moscow when faced with a common enemy in
wartime. On balance, it appears that Moscow gained more from its
open alliances with the United States than from its secret American
underground. By Tim Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   JORDAN-HUSSEIN-REVIEW (Undated) _ Shakespeare showed royalty to
be larger than life, but in the end very human. Now, from the
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, comes evidence to support that
portrayal: a most extraordinary document in the voice of a
modern-day king struggling with his own mortality as he grapples
with issues that were the stuff of the 16th century.

AFTER THE SPRAWL 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Battling sprawl has suddenly crystalized as a major quest of the
nation's public life _ but, typically, with almost all of the
attention focused on the easy half of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, states and communities are busy enacting
more than 110 anti-sprawl ballot questions such as big land buys
and growth curbs that passed in November; some 200 measures _ a
record _ were on ballots nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has made attacking land-gobbling growth
and the strip-malling of America a key theme of his presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And on Tuesday, the regional Environmental Protection Agency
office is convening a big-name ``Smart Growth Strategies for New
England'' summit in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But while ideas abound for stopping future sprawl through land
protection, zoning, transit, and architectural innovations,
planners and environmentalists are generally hard-pressed to figure
out how to fix the vast swaths of sprawl that already plague the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   From southern New Hampshire to Massachusetts' Route 9, and
throughout virtually every metropolitan area from New Jersey to
Atlanta to California, the landscape has filled up with six-lane
fast-food strips, big-box stores in asphalt lakes, and archipelago
subdivisions where you need a car just to buy milk or mail a
letter.
</P>
<P>
   While this region has fared far better than almost anywhere else
in resisting the trend, former Massachusetts environmental affairs
secretary Trudy Coxe declared last year that ``sprawl is the single
most important environmental issue facing any of us in New England
today.''
</P>
<P>
   So what, exactly, qualifies as sprawl? Richard Moe of the
National Trust for Historic Preservation has offered this widely
accepted definition: ``Low-density development on the edge of
cities and towns, poorly planned, land-consumptive, auto-dependent,
and designed without respect to its surroundings.''
</P>
<P>
   A broad national consensus is emerging that many of us hate
living this way and we want to save what remains of the country
from following suit. But given that so much sprawl is already with
us, is there any hope for retrofitting livable, walkable, pleasant
communities?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult, but not impossible, to do,'' says state
Representative John H. Stasik, a Framingham Democrat who formerly
chaired the town's planning board. ``Once you've built your
Levittown, your 40-foot-wide-roads that just crawl on forever, it's
tough to go back and plant the trees and add the sidewalks. But it
doesn't mean you can't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Morrish of the Design Center for the American Urban
Landscape, based at the University of Minnesota, admits that as a
profession, planners have a far better handle on reviving downtowns
and saving pastoral landscapes than fixing what lies in between.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today it's all about the edge and the center, because the
middle isn't recognized as being on fire,'' Morrish says. ``It's
more complex there, and we don't have any simple answers.''
</P>
<P>
   All that said, there are a handful of examples of efforts around
the country that could guide a sorely needed national discussion of
how to improve the sprawly environments that already dominate so
many communities. Some approaches include:
</P>
<P>
   --Manufacture a downtown. Several communities whose post-World
War II growth was driven largely by malls and automobiles have
decided to create village centers, including Schaumburg, Ill.,
northwest of Chicago, Warren Township, N.J., and the Atlanta suburb
of Smyrna.
</P>
<P>
   Shaumburg has spent more than $8 million amassing the 31-acre
town square site, a former strip-mall eyesore, and highlighted it
with a six-story clock tower. It has has attracted the Chicago
area's second largest public library and plans for 16 stores as
well as busy civic-event schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Smyrna, whose small downtown had been sliced in half to widen
the main drag between Atlanta and Marietta, has won national awards
for its made-from-scratch downtown. It features a city hall,
library, police station, and stores surrounding a brick town square
_ and, notably, 22 Back Bay-style homes on alleyways that sold out
in three months.
</P>
<P>
   But in Massachusetts and other states, existing zoning codes
often bizarrely forbid or at best complicate efforts to allow the
typical 19th-century village landscape so many people want, with
municipal buildings, churches, stores, and homes sitting
cheek-by-jowl.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, these efforts can result in artificial downtowns,
places like Mashpee Commons on Cape Cod or Reston Town Center in
the famously master-planned Virginia suburb. Both are well-received
antidotes to surrounding sprawl, but to some critics, they remain
ersatz places where people drive five miles to park in a giant lot,
then walk around in a contrived movie-lot downtown only tenuously
linked to the rest of the community.
</P>
<P>
   --Use new transit to spawn a downtown. ``Transit-oriented
development'' is one of planners' most popular buzzwords these
days. It describes matching new railroad and transit stations with
more permissive zoning to encourage creation of fairly dense,
walkable residential districts like Brookline or Cambridge and
commercial space within walking distance of the train stop.

IT WASN'T THE N-WORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Howard lost his job last week, compelled to resign as
director of the District of Columbia's Office of Public Advocate
for using a venerable English word correctly.
</P>
<P>
   The word was ``niggardly,'' which for 600 years has meant stingy
or grudging. Its lineage reaches back to (itals)hnoggr(unitals), an
Old Norse word for miserly. In one form or another, Shakespeare
uses `niggard' at least a dozen times, as for example when Brutus
tells Cassius in ``Julius Caesar'' that it is late and time to get
some sleep:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The deep of night is crept upon our talk,
</P>
<P>
   And nature must obey necessity;
</P>
<P>
   Which we will niggard with a little rest.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Charles Dickens describes Bentley Drummle, a doomed character in
``Great Expectations,'' as ``idle, proud, niggardly, reserved, and
suspicious.'' In 1965, dissenting from the Supreme Court's ruling
in Griswold v. Connecticut, Justice Hugo Black argued that to treat
the First Amendment ``as though it protects nothing but `privacy' .
. . is to give it a niggardly interpretation, not the kind of
liberal reading'' the Bill of Rights deserves. And in 2nd
Corinthians 9:6 (Revised Standard Version), the apostle Paul
writes:
</P>
<P>
   ``But do not forget that he who sows with a niggardly hand will
also reap a niggardly crop, and that he who sows bountifully will
also reap bountifully.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in precisely this sense that Howard used ``niggardly'' on
Jan. 15 when he reviewed the constituent services budget with two
of his aides, Marshall Brown and John Fanning. ``I will have to be
niggardly with this fund,'' he said, ``because it's not going to be
a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently somebody had been niggardly with Brown's and
Fanning's education, for they were offended by what they heard.
Brown _ who reportedly wanted Howard's job _ stormed out of the
office. At once, the ugly rumors started. Howard was flooded with
phone calls from outraged residents. The story making the rounds
was that he had said, ``I'm tired of all these niggers coming to me
with their problems.'' Ten days later, he was out of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Niggardly'' has about as much to do with the N-word as
``Day-Glo'' does with the anti-Italian slur ``dago.'' Washington's
new mayor, Anthony Williams, acknowledged as much.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams is anxious to appease the city's pernicious racial
extremists, who have been hounding him for not being ``black
enough.'' So rather than defend a white aide who had done nothing
wrong, he pronounced Howard's resignation ``appropriate.'' After
all, said the mayor, ``We're trying to bring our city together''
and officials must ``exercise the utmost judgment, discretion, and
caution'' in their choice of words.
</P>
<P>
   So this is what our national racial hypersensitivity has come
to: Other people's ignorance of English can cost you your job.
Don't say the room looks ``spic and span'' if Latinos are
listening. Don't call for a ``jigger'' of whiskey or refer to the
Niger River if blacks are within earshot. DJs, beware: Announce
that you're going to play some ``doo-wop,'' and you may be kicked
off the air. And just to be on the safe side, let's deep-six ``homo
sapiens'' _ no telling who might be offended.
</P>
<P>
   You think I exaggerate? Think again: Two days after Howard was
thrown to the wolves, Mayor Williams told the Washington Times that
decent people must avoid words that could sound offensive to
someone who didn't know better. ``Chink in the armor,'' he mused.
``I wouldn't say that now.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not news that languages evolve or that words can take on
meanings far from those they used to have. ``Gay,'' for example,
meant one thing in the 1940s, something very different today. But
that useful and innocuous words should be censored because people
with meager vocabularies might mistake them for something else?
This is a wholly modern idiocy, and it didn't start with
``niggardly.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine, an editorial designer for a major New York
publisher, once worked on a children's book that included a scene
of students drawing in an art class. Her editors refused to allow
the phrase ``colored markers.''
</P>
<P>
   Eden Jacobowitz, a freshman at the University of Pennsylvania,
leaned out of his window and yelled, ``Shut up, you water
buffalo!'' at a group of women partying very noisily late at night.
For uttering that epithet _ ``water buffalo'' _ the university
prosecuted him on charges of racial harassment.
</P>
<P>
   At Emory and Henry College in Virginia, minority students
demanded that the name of the athletic teams _ the Wasps _ be
changed. It upset them to think that someone might imagine that the
school was celebrating white Anglo-Saxon Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote a column once on the Motor Voter law, illustrating its
porousness by describing how easy it had been to register Jemima,
the Jacoby family cat, as a voter in three different states. Angry
readers called and wrote to denounce me as a racist _ because the
cat is named Jemima.
</P>
<P>
   David Howard is described by one of his black friends as ``the
most gentle, purest guy you'd ever want to meet.'' The victims of
mindless racial resentment so often are. People everywhere are
laughing about this incident. But at the heart of it is the
trashing of a decent man, and there's nothing funny about his pain.

   &UR; THE SENSE OF REALITY: STUDIES IN IDEAS AND THEIR HISTORY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Isaiah Berlin. Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $13.
</P>
<P>
   In nine essays, the eminent philosopher argues that the search
for a utopian society is the pursuit of a fantasy and that ideas
have consequences, but rarely those that are expected. ``For anyone
wanting to understand the twists and turns of the history of ideas,
this book will be indispensable,'' John Gray wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLOUDSPLITTER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Russell Banks. Harper Perennial, $15.
</P>
<P>
   This sprawling novel about the abolitionist John Brown, selected
by the editors of The New York Times Book Review as one of the best
books of 1998, is narrated by his third son, Owen, and is less a
historical epic about slavery than a domestic drama about the
challenge of living with a fanatic. The story tracks Owen's growth
from introverted son to struggling disciple to firebrand officer in
the bloody holy war of his father, whose failed raid on Harpers
Ferry in 1859 was one of the fuses that touched off the Civil War.
Last year in these pages, Walter Kirn praised the book's ``rich and
soulful'' language.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PILLAR OF FIRE: AMERICA IN THE KING YEARS, 1963-1965 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Taylor Branch. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $17.
</P>
<P>
   This middle volume of a planned trilogy on the life and times of
Martin Luther King Jr. covers such fateful events as the
assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Malcolm X and the signing of
the Civil Rights Act of 1964. ``By giving King such epic treatment,
Branch implies that he was an epic hero,'' Alan Wolfe wrote here in
1998. ``The great merit of Branch's stunning accomplishment is to
prove definitively that he was.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BEARING THE CROSS: MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., AND THE SOUTHERN
CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By David J. Garrow. Quill/Morrow, $16.
</P>
<P>
   This book maintains that while the victories of the civil rights
movement were not King's alone, his leadership was indispensable.
In 1986 the reviewer Howell Raines, said ``Garrow has provided the
fundament of fact on which future King biographies must rest.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VISITORS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Anita Brookner. Vintage Contemporaries, $12.
</P>
<P>
   This intensely introspective novel focuses on an emotionally
remote 70-year-old widow struggling to maintain her dignity in a
world without happy endings. ```Visitors' may be the book Brookner
has spent her life aiming toward,'' Jacqueline Carey wrote last
year. ``Nothing distracts us from the lesson that even failure can
entail an incredible triumph of will.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FOREIGN CORRESPONDENCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Geraldine Brooks. Anchor/Doubleday, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years after reaching out to pen pals in the Middle East,
Europe and America to escape her isolated childhood in 1960s
Australia, a journalist travels abroad to seek them out. In 1998
the reviewer Valerie Sayers, called this a ``charming and sharply
intelligent'' memoir ``full of a generous interest in the life
beyond the self.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DESTINY OF FIRE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Zo Oldenbourg. Carroll &AMP; Graf, $13.95.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 13th-century France, this novel chronicles the suffering
of a noble family that was part of a pacifist sect deemed heretical
by the Roman Catholic Church, and whose members were persecuted
during the ensuing Albigensian Crusade. ``Oldenbourg brings back to
us the cruelty and terror of one of the unhappiest episodes in the
long story of man's inhumanity to man,'' Thomas Caldecot Chubb
wrote in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; UNICORN'S BLOOD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Patricia Finney. Picador USA, $14.
</P>
<P>
   This is a tale of intrigue at Queen Elizabeth I's court
involving the pursuit of a stolen diary said to contain secrets
that could threaten the queen's reign. ``Finney's intricate novel''
is ``swiftly moving and deftly woven,'' Julie Gray wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TSAR: THE LOST WORLD OF NICHOLAS AND ALEXANDRA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Peter Kurth. Photographs by Peter Christopher. Back
Bay/Little, Brown, $29.95.
</P>
<P>
   This account of the last reigning Romanovs acknowledges their
political blunders and moral failings while emphasizing their
benevolent acts and abiding love for each other. In 1995, Francine
du Plessix Gray called the narrative ``amply documented and
compellingly written'' and the color photographs of Romanov sites
``as beautiful as any pictures I've seen of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MOSCOW: GOVERNING THE SOCIALIST METROPOLIS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Timothy J. Colton. Belknap/Harvard University, $24.95.
</P>
<P>
   This book traces the history of the Russian capital and the
politics that shaped it. In 1996 our reviewer, Stephen Kotkin, said
the author succeeds in ``superbly demonstrating the depth of the
Soviet-era contribution to the ancient city's outer face and inner
structure.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HORACE AFOOT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Frederick Reuss. Vintage Contemporaries, $13.
</P>
<P>
   The hero of this novel is a monkish middle-aged oddball, living
in a small town, who succumbs to the tug of intimacy when he
befriends a dying librarian and a self-destructive woman. The
result is ``a sly satire of Midwestern life and a restrained
account of how a closed heart comes to be unlocked,'' David Sacks
wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUMMER OF BETRAYAL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Hong Ying. Translated by Martha Avery. Grove, $12.
</P>
<P>
   A young poet's life unravels after she gets swept up in the 1989
Tiananmen Square protests and later finds her lover in bed with
another woman. ``Hong Ying's prose ... is both sensuous and
lapidary, eloquently expressing the novel's wide emotional and
intellectual range,'' Philip Gambone wrote in 1997.

 UNDATED: ... train stop.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One example of a community that has been struggling to o this
is Gresham, Ore., a Portland suburb. For 30 years, various plans
were floated for development of an old county fairgrounds,
including standard megamalls. None ever materialized, and since
1995, the city has instead been trying to develop a European-style
Civic Neighborhood surrounding a new transit stop. An 846-unit
apartment complex proposal has come up, but many other elements are
stalled. ``It's tough pushing the market, and that's what we're
doing with this project,'' city community development director Max
Talbot acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
   One limitation to this approach is that normally the most easily
constructable transit lines follow abandoned railroads that,
sometimes deliberately, avoid population centers.
</P>
<P>
   And when transit is badly sited, it can actually drive sprawl.
In small suburbs south of Boston such as Carver, Halifax, and
Plympton, the revival of the Old Colony commuter railroad is
pushing explosive subdivision construction to serve an influx of
downtown workers seeking affordable homes.
</P>
<P>
   While the Old Colony line is easing traffic on Boston-bound
highways, some see it perversely spawning sprawl in the region.
``You can't get to virtually any of these stations without getting
in your car,'' says Mark Primack of the Wildlands Trust of
Southeastern Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   If these communities _ none with full-time planners _ had the
gumption and resources, Primack and other environmentalists
contend, they could take steps to focus much of the coming
residential development in zones within, say, a 10-minute walk of
the train station. That would ease pressure to turn the countryside
into two-acre lots that atomize the landscape and make people need
their cars to run any kind of errand.
</P>
<P>
   --Inject housing. By some accounts, the way to battle sprawl is
to encourage shorter trips, not bigger roads _ thus reducing
traffic and sprawl by keeping people closer to where they work and
shop. One obvious way to do this is to encourage development of
housing in shopping malls and suburban office campuses that now
feature traffic jams by day and desolation by night.
</P>
<P>
   In the Buckhead section of Atlanta, perhaps America's sprawl
capital, luxury condominium complexes have begun to rise in the
middle of shopping mall parking lots along the Buckhead Loop,
encouraging 24-hour urban life. Besides allowing at least some
workers and shoppers to walk instead of drive, retrofitting housing
into office parks and shopping malls has the added benefit of
making them slightly more community-like places.
</P>
<P>
   But, addressing a topic many officials acknowledge but won't
describe out loud, Framingham's Stasik admits that in suburbs, the
idea of apartments or townhouses in malls ``always brings up images
of low-income housing and Section 8,'' the rental voucher program
blamed for turning communities seedy.
</P>
<P>
   Anecdotal evidence suggests huge pent-up demand for semi-urban
townhouse living within walking distance from work and shops. But
there are few local examples of in-mall living (Masphee Commons's
new second-story apartments are a rare exception) to encourage
tradition-bound developers to take the plunge.
</P>
<P>
   And even if it builds community, letting developers build more
can create controversy. ``A lot of times when a multi-use proposal
comes up, all it is seen as doing is increasing someone's profit,''
observes Lincoln developer William G. Constable, a top leader of
the new Massachusetts Environmental Collaborative, a coalition of
local groups that has made attacking sprawl a top goal.
</P>
<P>
   --Blow things up. Rockville, Md., and Park Forest, Ill., are two
communities that have torn down failed shopping malls to open up
space for new Main Street downtowns with housing, and storefronts
with on-street parking.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, local officials tore down the 1972-vintage
Rockville Mall, a fortress-like failure of Lafayette Place
proportions that went bankrupt barely a decade after it opened.
</P>
<P>
   The city streets that had once criss-crossed the 7.7-acre site
were recreated. A 13-screen cinema complex opened in November as
the showpiece of a planned $300 million town center complex
including restaurants, more than 1 million square feet of offices,
and, perhaps someday, apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Park Forest, south of Chicago, has spent more than $6 million
over the last three years razing the 1950s Centre Mall and
re-creating a Main Street. But to date, only a third of the core
downtown storefronts are occupied, efforts to turn parking lots
into senior housing and apartments are moving slowly, and debt and
maintenance costs are piling up.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, one small example is in Yarmouth on Cape Cod, where the
town bought a decrepit drive-in along Route 28 to create a
waterfront park, a first step toward an emerging plan to redevelop
the famously horrendous Route 28 strip into a more livable
thoroughfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``This stuff may appear to be just a drop in the bucket here and
there,'' acknowledges Stuart Meck of the American Planning
Association, but he sees evidence it shows growing acceptance for
turning tired malls into real neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With success stories so rare, the prospects for reversing sprawl
through new community-building construction leave many
environmentalists feeling the only hope is try to stop more sprawl
from happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprawl is this insidious system,'' says Armando Carbonell of
the Cape Cod Commission, driven by a desire to get away from the
congestion of the last new subdivision and strip mall to go in up
the road. ``The reason people wind up creating sprawl is because
they want to get away from it,'' Carbonell says.
</P>
<P>
   John DeVillars, the regional EPA chief and organizer of
Tuesday's summit (dubbed ``Sprawlapalooza'' by some EPA aides),
said in a seemingly hopeless case like Route 9 in Framingham or
Route 1 in Saugus, ``The best thing we might do is buy a camera,
take some pictures and go community by community with a slide show
and say: `Warning, this could happen to you.' ''

This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

speech. But it's not. It's Senator Edward M. Kennedy, speaking
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The point is neither that the president is a thief nor that
Kennedy is a prophet. But their fascinating relationship, now with
six busy years of history, is as close to Shakespeare's marriage of
true minds as one can imagine in politics.
</P>
<P>
   It began in domestic policy at the beginning in 1993, with their
alliance in reauthorizing the government's education programs, from
Head Start to college loans and grants-in-aid, and giving an
initial shove to New Democrat (Clinton) and Enduring Democrat
(Kennedy) ideas like national service and charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   And it began in foreign policy around the same time when Clinton
became the first president to make a serious effort to break the
violent stalemate in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   It has never stopped, from health care to 100,000 new teachers,
from a higher minimum wage to a proposed end to job discrimination
against gay people.
</P>
<P>
   Around here, it has finally become chic to notice that nobody in
Congress has a more extensive ability to get things done than
Kennedy _ across the aisle and between the branches. But what is
usually lost in the insider game is an appreciation for the breadth
of the idea shop he has operated.
</P>
<P>
   And in the president's case, the endless fascination with his
political skills and his New emocrat roots in the mid-1980s has
missed the method in his madness.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton likes to tell friends, one reason for all the
wrenching change in his first five years (in crime,
budget-balancing, welfare, and military readiness) was to get some
monkeys off the Democratic Party's back so that a fresh round of
progress would be possible on the foundation of a vibrant economy.
</P>
<P>
   In that context, it is impossible to examine this year's State
of the Union without encountering the Kennedy in Clinton again and
again: from prescription drugs under Medicare to the patients' bill
of rights; from long-term- care financing to equal pay for women;
from a fresh round of new opportunities for the disabled to
legislation targeting hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The connection on universal savings accounts is especially
topical.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Kennedy was thinking ahead in the immediate
aftermath of Clinton's victory in the budget wars over Newt
Gingrich. He and then-Republican Senator Nancy Kassebaum had
already led the president to the idea of secure health insurance
that could travel with a worker from job to job.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy turned to retirement security. His diagnosis then was
Clinton's last month _ roughly 70 million workers have zero pension
coverage. And for two-thirds of the elderly already, Social
Security benefits make up more than half their income, and for more
than 40 percent, the percentage is 75.
</P>
<P>
   In a different budgetary environment, Kennedy's universal
accounts relied solely on tax incentives.
</P>
<P>
   With the possibility of long-term budget surpluses in a healthy
economy, the president could sweeten the pot with targeted
subsidies for lower-income working families that would work pretty
much like the employer match that swells 401(k) accounts.
</P>
<P>
   For Kennedy back then and Clinton now, the idea is far from a
scheme to redistribute wealth. Instead, it is a means of making the
same opportunities available to all workers and to far more small
companies via the budget surplus that federal tax policy now
provides for more established firms and higher income workers who
can make maximum contributions to investment plans.
</P>
<P>
   When Kennedy first proposed universal accounts, the concept of
``corporate responsibility'' was much in the air, thanks to
agitation that stretched from many liberals right through the
presidential movements of politicians like Ross Perot and Pat
Buchanan. And the senator's idea was to target his tax breaks on
``most favored companies'' that didn't do things like move
operations to Mexico or drop health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   It never went anywhere, but as Kennedy noted in a memo to the
White House in December, universal accounts would be a perfect
means of promoting retirement investment that could supplement
basic Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Politically and substantively, he argued, they were far
preferable to individual accounts that rely on a percentage of
Social Security tax revenue and would eventually lead to major cuts
in the basic benefit, a competing notion the president had
considered.
</P>
<P>
   For the zillionth time, Clinton agreed. Someday, some university
genius will get a doctorate figuring out in depth how these two
pols operated in tandem.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, it's enough to know that one of the most
consistently reliable clues to the direction of the Clinton
administration has been the thinking of a relentlessly innovative
policy wonk named Kennedy.

VP TIMBER STANDS TALLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Three maxims true, with 2000 in view:
</P>
<P>
   1. No one seriously runs for vice president; but . . .
</P>
<P>
   2. Running for president is a nifty way to be chosen as a vice
presidential running mate, which is helpful because . . .
</P>
<P>
   3. Having been a VP candidate is an even niftier path to a
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   These truisms would have astounded Alexander Throttlebottom, the
character invented by George S. Kaufman and Morrie Ryskind for the
Gershwin brothers' 1931 musical, ``Of Thee I Sing.'' Elected as the
running mate to John P. Wintergreen, Throttlebottom ``lives at 1448
Z Street . . . with the other boarders'' and ``sits around in the
park and feeds the pigeons, and takes walks, and goes to the
movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the nation's second banana inhabits a mansion in D.C.,
which Congress swiped from the Navy's top admiral 20 years ago. If
the veep wants to feed pigeons, he can scatter seed from Air Force
Two.
</P>
<P>
   These trends do not mean that Bill Bradley will soon install a
hoop on the winding driveway on Massachusetts Avenue or that John
Kasich will forget his frequent-flier miles. But Bradley, the
former New Jersey Democratic senator, and Kasich, the Buckeye
budgetary whiz from Columbus, personify the post-Throttlebottom
running mate: high-profile competence.
</P>
<P>
   Since John F. Kennedy forged a Boston-to-Austin axis with Lyndon
B. Johnson in 1960, it has also been bad form for a defeated rival
to duck the dubious honor of being number two, no matter how
eloquent the protest.
</P>
<P>
   Two tentative candidates for president could be VP timber. Pete
Wilson ran badly in 1995 and is not a beloved figure in California,
but few doubt his competence as legislator, mayor, US senator, and
governor. Elizabeth Dole has several Cabinet portfolios, star
appeal and first-mate campaigning experience in 1996. Even if she
does not win most presidential primaries in 2000, performing well
in them would make her a logical and emotional choice for veep.
</P>
<P>
   Experience counts. In 1988, Michael Dukakis made mistakes in his
presidential campaign, but choosing Lloyd Bentsen as his accomlice
was not one of them. The tall Texan, then 67, did not deliver the
29 electoral votes of Texas, but brought Senate credentials and his
own experience as a White House aspirant in 1976. As Dukakis
savored a swig of the JFK-LBJ elixir, he sought the same Lone Star
legislative savvy that united Governor Franklin Roosevelt with one
of his rivals in 1932, House Speaker John Nance Garner, the sage of
Uvalde, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The worst question that can be asked about a vice presidential
nominee is ``Who?'' George Bush, with his whimsical choice of Dan
Quayle, did a disservice to the young senator from Indiana. Quayle,
despite his stigmata of Throttlebottom jokes, is bright and shrewd
enough to have become a serious presidential contender on his own.
He's running for the top job now, trying to persuade voters that
vindication is not his sole motive. That's unfair, but he did enjoy
a comfortable four years in that big mansion.
</P>
<P>
   The Throttlebottom gag relied on anonymity. ``Th' prisidincy is
th' highest office in th' gift iv th' people. Th' vice-prisidincy
is th' next-highest an' th' lowest,'' Finley Peter Dunne's ``Mr.
Dooley'' wrote 100 years ago. ``It isn't a crime exactly. Ye can't
be sint to jail f'r it, but it's a kind iv a disgrace. It's like
writin' anonymous letters.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Of Thee I Sing,'' the only way Throttlebottom got inside
the White House was on a public tour. Now, he'd have a plush office
there because presidents treat vice presidents as peers and
partners.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1960, of the 13 VP candidates of the major parties, most
sought the White House on their own before or after assuming their
running-mate chores, becoming household names. Quayle is the ninth
such candidate. Usually well-informed sources hint that the 10th
will be Al Gore.

 FINDINGS ON AGING COULD LEAD TO FERTILITY TREATMENT
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Boston scientists have abolished the mouse version of menopause,
opening a new window on the mechanisms of female aging.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers report Monday that they have engineered mice
whose ovaries grow viable eggs and secrete estrogen into advanced
old age _ the mouse equivalent of human centenarians.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jonathan L. Tilly of Massachusetts General Hospital, who led
the project, said his team is nowhere near trying the same thing in
humans and isn't sure whether that would even be a good thing. But
the genetically engineered mice offer ways to study what happens to
female blood vessels, bones, brain cells, and other tissues when
one of the normal mainsprings of aging is suspended indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``To extend ovarian lifespan is unbelievable,'' Tilly said in an
interview. ``With sustained ovary function, we would expect various
organ systems to benefit, and overall lifespan to be extended.''
</P>
<P>
   The new mouse strain does not open the door to geriatric
motherhood, possibly because the aged animals lack the pituitary
hormones necessary to sustain pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   However, Tilly and his colleagues hope their findings will lead
to treatments to preserve fertility in women who undergo premature
menopause due to an inborn disease or cancer chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers' main aim is to better understand
menopause-driven disorders so scientists can devise treatments to
benefit menopausal women. For instance, the ovaries secrete other
substances besides estrogen that might affect aging.
</P>
<P>
   ``This provides us with a model that will allow us to tease out
the molecular and cellular mechanisms of menopause, and beyond
that, the mechanisms that link menopause to the diseases of aging
in women,'' added Dr. Frank Bellino of the National Institute on
Aging, which partially funded the research.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wulf Utian of Case Western Reserve Medical School in
Cleveland, a leading menopause specialist, said the mouse strain
could help solve such enigmas as why some middle-age women have
youthful-appearing ovaries while those of others at the same age
are shriveled.
</P>
<P>
   ``This work has opened new vistas, but the end of the rainbow is
still far away,'' Utian said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse experiments are reported in the current issue of
Nature Genetics. They were carried out by Tilly and his colleagues
at the Vincent Center for Reproductive Biology at MGH along with
Stanley J. Korsmeyer of Dana Farber Cancer Center and co-workers at
Washington University in St. Louis and the University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The group was able to arrest what had seemed an immutable law of
mammalian nature, the inexorable depletion of ova or egg cells.
Ovaries in all mammals obey a strict genetic command that causes
ova to die at a steady rate throughout life until the supply is
depleted.
</P>
<P>
   The ovaries of human fetuses contain several million eggs, but
for unknown reasons the number dwindles to about 1 million at the
time of birth. At puberty, girls have about 400,000 egg cells, but
by menopause (age 51 on average), nearly none remain, even though
only one ovum is normally released from the ovary each month during
the 450 or so menstrual cycles a normal woman will have.
</P>
<P>
   Because ova are the females' main source of estrogen, their
exhaustion starts a chain of events linked to diseases as diverse
as osteoporosis and dementia.
</P>
<P>
   The MGH researcher said he doesn't ``want anyone to think this
will have immediate application in humans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time anyone has proved this can work, and if
it can work in a mouse, perhaps it will in humans,'' he said. ``Now
we can ask the question for the first time: Do we even want to
sustain ovarian function? We couldn't test that before.''
</P>
<P>
   One potential problem is that perpetual estrogen output could
raise the risk of cancer, just as current postmenopausal estrogen
supplements do for uterine cancer and possibly for breast cancer.
So far, the researchers have seen no cancers in their aged mice,
but relatively few animals have been studied.
</P>
<P>
   Indications are that the geriatric mice maintain a strikingly
youthful character without evidence of harmful estrogen-related
effects. Their uteruses resemble those of much younger animals
instead of the shrunken organs of normal aged mice.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers were surprised to find that all it took to
forestall the normal aging of ovaries was to disable a single
master gene that controls the rate of cell death.
</P>
<P>
   The gene, called bax, controls the rate of programmed cell
death, a self-destruct mechanism scientifically known as apoptosis
that allows the body to rid itself of flawed or extraneous cells.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers knocked out the bax gene in mouse embryos,
creating a gene defect that seemed to produce no harmful effects in
the animals later in life. In fact, they live longer than normal
mice.
</P>
<P>
   Egg follicles continued to develop in the ovaries of the
bax-less mice as late as 22 months, ancient by mouse longevity
standards. However, the females did not become pregnant when caged
with male mice, which Tilly thinks is due to shutdown of sex
hormones from the pituitary gland in the animals' brains.
</P>
<P>
   When the researchers removed the eggs from their geriatric mice,
they found they were capable of being fertilized in the test tube
and of growing into normal-appearing embryos.

KETCHUP AD CLAIMS DON'T FIT THE FACTS, CRITICS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's an eye-catching ad, not least because it implies that
ketchup may help prevent cancer. And it's catching the eyes of more
than just consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Public health researchers and consumer advocates are seeing red
over it. US agencies that regulate food labeling and advertising
are looking at it. And cancer patients are calling to find out
where they can get a purified form of the supposed preventive
substance.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, the Heinz ad has spawned a new controversy amid the
growing debate over health claims for food and dietary supplements.
</P>
<P>
   The full-page color ad has run in the New York Times Magazine,
USA Today, and elsewhere, and it features ketchup slowly pouring
out of a Heinz ketchup bottle, with a headline suggesting that the
naturally occurring chemical that makes tomatoes red _ lycopene _
may prevent cervical and prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When can we make health claims to the public? What are the
legal issues that impact upon advertising? What are the ethical
standards that companies should use when quoting people's work in
their ads?'' asks Dr. Steven K. Clinton, an Ohio State cancer
prevention specialist whose research on lycopene was footnoted in
the ad without his knowledge, and to his dismay.
</P>
<P>
   While preliminary evidence has found an association between the
consumption of fresh, cooked, and processed tomatoes and a lower
risk of some cancers and other diseases, public health researchers
and advocates say it is too soon to make pronouncements about
health benefits, particularly from ketchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's premature to make a strong statement about ketchup
preventing cancer. One of the concerns, too, is the context in
which ketchup is taken. If it's part of a Big Mac, that may not be
ideal,'' said Dr. Edward of the schools of medicine and public
health at Harvard. Giovannucci, who worked with Clinton on some of
the research, was also surprised by the ad.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest evidence so far suggests an association between
consumption of tomatoes and tomato products, particularly tomato
sauce, and a lower risk of prostate cancer. While Giovannucci, lead
author of that study, said it could be something other than
lycopene at work, he added that the findings seem to support the
role of the chemical.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not enough to justify the Heinz ad, say critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is completely off the charts,'' said Dr. Sidney Wolfe,
director of Public Citizen Health Research Group, a
Washington-based consumer advocacy group founded by Ralph Nader.
``They're essentially making a medical claim.''
</P>
<P>
   Under US law, medical claims have to be approved by the Food and
Drug Administration as being supported by ``significant scientific
agreement'' before they can be placed on food labels. They also
have to meet truth-in-advertising standards of the Federal Trade
Commission. The FDA has never approved a claim that
lycopene-containing foods may reduce cancer risk.
</P>
<P>
   While federal regulators will not say whether they are
investigating the Heinz ad, both the FDA and the FTC have had it
brought to their attention, spokeswomen said.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Foster, director of corporate communications for the
Pittsburgh-based H.J. Heinz Co., said the campaign is aimed at
educating the public about the possible benefits of lycopene. She
says it makes no health claim about ketchup and does not involve a
food label.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not prescribing ketchup to cure cancer,'' Foster said.
``What we have is a consumer education program that talks about the
health benefits of lycopene. I think that the ad very nicely points
out that lycopene is found in a number of processed food
products.'' A chart in the ad, which ran last month, compared
ketchup's lycopene content to soup, sauce, and canned and fresh
tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   But Bonnie Liebman, director of nutrition for the consumer
advocacy group, Center for Science in the Public Interest, said the
chart is misleading, because it cites lycopene content per ounce,
not per serving. ``People don't eat one ounce of each of those
foods. They eat less of ketchup than of any other,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The usual serving size for ketchup is a tablespoon, or half an
ounce; for tomato sauce, it is at least four ounces, Liebman said.
</P>
<P>
   Heinz's Foster defended the presentation and stressed that its
goal is to educate the public about the naturally occurring
chemical. She pointed to the headline's wording, ``Lycopene may
help reduce the risk. . .'' as evidence. ``It does not say ketchup.
It says lycopene.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are bombarded by competing, and sometimes confusing,
messages about what's healthy to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, it confuses the public. They're just going to
throw up their hands and say, `I'm going to eat whatever I want,'
'' said Liebman, whose Washington-based group focuses on dietary
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The ad ``contributes to that kind of confusion.'' Liebman said.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, supplement marketers won on appeal a suit against
the FDA after it refused approval of claims for antioxidants,
omega-3 fatty acids, fiber and folic acid. The marketers argued
that the government, which could still file its own appeal,
violated their First Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
   Makers of food products, from cereals to orange juice, have also
been courting endorsements from health organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The Heinz ad, in fact, features the seal of the Cancer Research
Foundation of America, a Virginia-based nonprofit that has received
$60,000 from the ketchup maker for nutrition research. Stephanie
Guiffre, media relations director for the foundation, which
channels about $1 million a year into cancer prevention research,
said this is the first time it has taken part in such a campaign,
undertaken only after a stringent review.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are doing by putting our logo on the ad is endorsing
the use of lycopene,'' said Guiffre, who acknowledged that more
research is needed into its cancer prevention potential. ``We're
not endorsing the product.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Cancer Society has not endorsed lycopene or
ketchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's risky to emphasize single nutrients or single foods. The
number of studies and data for lycopene is still limited,'' said
Dr. Michael Thun, who heads up epidemiological research for the
organization. The society has endorsed products that it judges to
have scientifically supported cancer prevention potential, such as
Nicorette gum.
</P>
<P>
   Since the ad first ran three weeks ago, Clinton, whose work was
cited by Heinz, has received about 50 inquiries from desperate
cancer patients looking for pure lycopene, from other companies
worried about Heinz gaining an edge, and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The implications of this extend from science to marketing, to
different industries in the marketplace, to concerned people at
risk, all the way to cancer patients,'' said Clinton, who recently
left the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute for Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this ad that's very carefully worded, there's an implied
health benefit. The message that people take home is, `This is good
for me. It will prevent prostate and cervical cancer, and it's
endorsed by scientists and a cancer research organization.' That's
the message people take home.''

WHAT ANIMALS HIBERNATE BESIDES BEARS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Besides bears, what other animals hibernate?
</P>
<P>
   D.R., Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. This might come as a surprise. According to a number of
experts, bears don't really hibernate. They are more like nappers _
just ask anybody who's had the misfortune of stumbling upon a
bear's den during a winter hike.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists say the only true hibernators are deep sleepers
that can take an hour or more to wake to a normal level of
activity. In New England these are the woodchuck, little and big
brown bats, and the jumping mouse (so named because it looks like a
miniature kangaroo).
</P>
<P>
   In all mammals that go into some level of dormancy,
environmental conditions trigger the brain's hypothalamus to
release hormones that signal the metabolism to slow.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edgar Folk, professor of physiology at the University of
Iowa, has been studying hibernation since the 1930's. ``It's a
marvelous symphony in various organs all working together to change
the body's temperature,'' he says, and the hypothalamus is the
conductor that orchestrates those changes.
</P>
<P>
   The first change is a drop in temperature. In deep sleepers, it
drops from the high 90s Fahrenheit to just above freezing. The
breathing rate drops to just one or two breaths per minute. The
heart drops to just four or five beats per minute. Blood pressure
falls way off, too.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another surprise. Even the truest hibernators don't stay
asleep all winter. Folk says they wake up every four days on
average to eat and drink (except for the woodchuck, which feeds on
fat stored in its body) from supplies stored in their burrows. They
defecate, urinate, and go back to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The lighter sleepers, the nappers, include bears, raccoons,
skunks, and chipmunks. But if the definition of hibernation
includes some slowing of the metabolism, Folk says skunks and
raccoons may not qualify: ``We were disappointed to find in many
experiments we did that skunks and raccoons show no sign of
metabolic depression,'' he says. They just sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Bears are in the middle. They're not deep sleepers, but they're
not plain old nappers either. They prepare for hibernation by
increasing their calorie intake from 6,000 to 20,000 a day. Then,
weeks before they enter the den, they stop eating and don't take
another bite until they emerge in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Once bedded down, a bear's body temperature drops about 10
degrees. Its heart rate goes from 50 beats a minute in summer sleep
to just 8 per minute. A hibernating bear's breathing rate has never
been measured, but Folk says they use 50 percent less oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bears really do hibernate,'' Folk says. ``They're just better
hibernators than the smaller animals. Evolution has given them a
form of hibernation that's not as deep, so they can protect
themselves from predators, especially other bears, which can be
quite nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   But hibernating bears neither eat, drink, defecate, nor urinate
all winter. Dr. Ralph Nelson of the Carle Hospital's Research
Center in Urbana, Ill., discovered that bears have proteins that
let them convert the poisonous ammonia in urine back into usable
proteins. Their food comes from stored body fat _ remember those
20,000 calories a day? _ a process that also creates water. Bears
lose 15 to 25 percent of their body fat over the winter, but
remarkably, their lean body mass actually increases.
</P>
<P>
   Outside New England, deep hibernators include marmots, hamsters,
and dormice (named from the French ``dormir'' _ to sleep). Hamsters
can drop from 300 breaths a minute to one every two minutes.
Beatrix Potter's Mrs. Tiggywinkle, the European hedgehog, is a true
hibernator too. Hedgehogs can survive on one breath every twenty
minutes!

 PASADENA, Calif.: ... favorite shows.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Proponents of such blends of drama and comedy say they offer
sophisticated writing about grown-up issues while creating
original, distinctive, fully realized worlds. That, some say, is
the best way to pull back viewers at a time when one sitcom after
another gets bogged down in puerile sexual banter. (Sassa's recent
call for less focus on sex in NBC's comedies was seen by some as a
tacit admission that sitcoms are in a rut, especially given that
NBC rose to dominance primarily on the strength of its sitcoms.)
</P>
<P>
   Shows like ``Sports Night'' work because they do not insult the
audience's intelligence. ``Play up to the audience, that's a big
part of it,'' said Kelsey Grammer, star of ``Frasier.'' ``Assume
that they are more intelligent than you are. That seemed to work
with `Frasier.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
More animation
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition, as writers and producers try to rejuvenate TV
comedy, they are increasingly turning to animation. Five new
animated shows are premiering on UPN and Fox at midseason,
including Larry &QC; 
Charles's new project, ``Dilbert,'' on UPN. Animated programs like
Tom Snyder's upcoming ``Home Movies'' offer not just a change in
format but a take on the world that's different from that in
traditional live-action sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also too many warmed-over concepts in the works
that suggest Hollywood still doesn't get it.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, during an interview session with TV critics in
Pasadena, Calif., earlier this month, writer/producer Daniel Paige
called for an overhaul of sitcoms, saying, ``The sitcom form needs
to grow if it's going to survive. The audience is just too smart.
You can't keep spoon-feeding them the same things.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Paige's new sitcom on the WB network, ``Zoe, Duncan, Jack &AMP;
Jane,'' does just that. At bottom, it is essentially a younger
version of NBC's much-copied ``Friends,'' right down to the
brother-sister duo.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when sitcoms like NBC's ``Veronica's Closet'' trade in
snideness and nastiness at the expense of genuine humor, some
believe television comedy needs to adjust its very attitude and
tone. ``People are bored with cynical humor,'' insisted Jenna
Elfman, star of ABC's ``Dharma &AMP; Greg.'' She added that the
cynicism of many contemporary sitcoms is compounded by their
artificiality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Genuinely funny things that have you at home rolling on the
couch are because there's some moment of truth,'' said Elfman.
``But if you are trying to be funny, going for comedic stuff
instead of the truth of the situation or the moment, then people
will just squirm and be embarrassed for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Burnett, the executive producer of ``Late Night with David
Letterman'' and the upcoming ``The Late Late Show with Craig
Kilborn,'' is plunging into the sitcom world with a project called
``Stuckey's,'' but he agrees that too many sitcoms have the ring of
falsity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of them are very artificial,'' said Burnett. ``Whereas
`Sanders' portrayed reality in such a true and funny way, and
`Seinfeld' developed its own language, most sitcoms now are about a
bunch of smart comedy writers thinking of clever turns of phrase.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Danson's new role
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of television's greatest sitcoms was ``Cheers''; the show's
star, Ted Danson, now plays a cantankerous doctor who revels in
political incorrectness on CBS's ``Becker.'' Danson says that the
sitcom genre can revive by being more venturesome.
</P>
<P>
   ```Seinfeld' broke all the rules, and the next great show ...
also will break some rules,'' said Danson. ``You have to be willing
to risk, to go into places that have never been touched before, and
then trust that the network and the powers that be will give you a
chance to put it on.''
</P>
<P>
   But rule-breaking comedies are also more likely to be the target
of protests from pressure groups, making networks even more
reluctant than usual to take risks (there has already been
criticism, for example, of Eddie Murphy's ``The PJs''). That has
been coupled with an economic trend that some say has helped
diminish the quality of sitcoms. Program costs for established hit
sitcoms are beginning to go through the same roof pierced by
``Seinfeld'' and ``ER.'' NBC ponied up $73 million to keep ``Mad
About You'' on its schedule for the 1998-99 season, including $1
million apiece per episode for Helen Hunt and Paul Reiser, only to
see the show's ratings plummet. With costs like that in mind,
networks are increasingly prone to keep shows on the air because
they own a piece of them and control their costs, not because
they're any good. Conversely, they are quicker to pull the plug on
shows provided by an independent production company.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big problem is the ownership of shows by the network,'' said
Peter Casey, co-executive producer of ``Frasier.'' ``I honestly
feel that they favor their shows over shows that they don't have a
piece of, in terms of keeping them on the air longer.''
</P>
<P>
   But some argue that producers like Casey symbolize another part
of the problem: namely, that they are tempted to take on too many
projects because the pool of talented writer-producers has grown so
shallow that networks turn to them time and again. This year, Casey
and his fellow ``Frasier'' executive producers David Angell and
David Lee shouldered the double duty of creating ``Encore!
Encore!'' while trying to keep their existing show at the top of
the heap.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot: ``Encore! Encore!'' was a critical and ratings
disaster, and the quality of ``Frasier'' began to slip.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no universal agreement on the cause or the
solution, the sense that sitcoms are in the doldrums clearly has
many in Hollywood worried. Not the insouciant Kathy Griffin,
though. The carrot-topped costar of ``Suddenly Susan'' had the
answer at her fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good sitcom should be engaging. You should be able to watch
two minutes and you're in,'' said Griffin. ``And you need a funny
red-haired sidekick.''

PAYING TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO THE PONTIFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When John F. Kennedy ran for president way back in 1960, one of
the biggest obstacles he faced was his religion: He was a Roman
Catholic, and no Catholic had ever been elected president of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during his campaign for the Democratic nomination,
Kennedy decided that he needed to address the religious issue, and
he did so by pledging that if elected he would owe his allegiance
to the Constitution and the American people, not to the Catholic
Church and the pope.
</P>
<P>
   The voters took Kennedy at his word, and he went on to win the
White House in a close election over Richard Nixon. Kennedy's
religion was never an issue during his presidency; he adhered to
his promise that the church would not be allowed to meddle in the
secular business of America.
</P>
<P>
   So. If a Catholic president elected nearly 40 years ago took no
marching orders from the pope, why is the Baptist governor of
Missouri giving the pontiff veto power over capital punishment in
1999?
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to St. Louis last week, Pope John Paul II urged
Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan to spare the life of a triple murderer
who was scheduled for execution in February. Carnahan complied,
commuting the killer's death sentence to life in prison without
possibility of parole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I continue to support capital punishment,'' Carnahan said
after granting the reprieve to longtime Death Row resident Darrell
Mease, ``but after careful consideration of (the pope's) direct and
personal appeal and because of a deep and abiding respect for the
pontiff and all he represents, I decided last night to grant his
request.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope had preached against capital punishment Wednesday
during a public Mass at the Trans World Dome in St. Louis, and he
later made a personal request to Carnahan to spare Mease's life.
Mease's execution date had been postponed from Wednesday to Feb.
10, apparently to avoid putting him to death while the pope was in
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the pope's plea for mercy, there was no reason for
Carnahan to commute Mease's death sentence. There was no question
that Mease was guilty of the 1988 murders of a fellow drug dealer
and the dealer's wife and grandson. Mease's partisans weren't even
claiming that he had undergone a spectacular Death Row religious
conversion in the manner of the late Karla Faye Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Tucker, the Texas pickax killer? The pope wanted Gov.
George W. Bush to rescue her from the lethal needle, but Bush
adhered to a ruling by the state Board of Pardons and Paroles,
which permitted Tucker to receive the earthly justice she deserved.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor evidently has a better understanding than the
Missouri governor of the distinction between religion and
government.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan, a Democrat who plans to run for the U.S. Senate next
year, would have been better advised to demonstrate his reverence
for the pope by kissing the pontiff's ring rather than overruling a
jury of Missouri residents and the various courts that have
rejected Mease's appeals over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Look, folks, I'm not here to criticize the pope. I did that
once, in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and nearly got run out of town on a
rail.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I spent 12 of my most formative years attending
Catholic schools. I don't want one of the nuns who ruled my life so
many years ago tracking me down and rapping my knuckles for
disrespecting the Holy Father.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is a great and godly man, an inspiration to Catholics
and non-Catholics all around the world. No one will ever catch me
saying otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The pope and religious leaders of all faiths are entitled to
express themselves, in any forum they might choose, regarding what
they believe to be the moral responsibilities of government. But
religious beliefs are not the law of the land _ not in the United
States of America.
</P>
<P>
   No president or governor, no official at any level of government
in America, should make decisions based on the desires or dictates
of any church. That is the law of the land.

POPCORN'S NEW KERNELS OF WISDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, when she was a fledgling trend seer, Faith
Plotkin saw her own future and legally changed her last name to the
infinitely more memorable Popcorn. Now the chairwoman of
BrainReserve, a marketing consulting firm, she makes her fortune
selling predictions to companies great and small.
</P>
<P>
   She has written two popular books: ``The Popcorn Report,'' a
bestseller in the 1980s, and ``Clicking,'' published last year.
After reading the latter, I wanted to ask Popcorn about some of her
ideas for the future, especially a concept she calls AtmosFear.
It's a kind of rampant environmental paranoia rife with all sorts
of fabulous marketing opportunities, according to Popcorn, at
least. Unfortunately for me, Popcorn's publicist said Madame Faith
is booked solid through the millennium and can't spare five minutes
to talk to anybody who isn't already scheduled. The publicist
didn't specify whether Popcorn was booked through the false
millennium or the genuine, but either way, I can take a hint.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Popcorn became an overnight media darling when she
identified a trend and coined the term ``cocooning'' to describe
people retreating to the comfort and safety of their nests. The
cocooning concept grows larger by the day, ``a driving force in
American culture and society,'' as Popcorn modestly acknowledges in
``Clicking.'' And yet I can't help but wonder: If everybody is
cocooning, how come nobody is ever at home when I try to call them?
They all can't have caller ID, can they?
</P>
<P>
   Popcorn is so successful at anticipating trends that now others
are paying her the sincerest form of flattery, trying to
out-Popcorn Popcorn, as it were. ``Clicking'' led me to another
book, ``Iconoculture: The Future Ain't What It Used to Be,'' by a
trio of prognosticators who clearly covet a piece of Popcorn's
action, Vickie Abrahamson, Mary Meehan, and Larry Samuel. Many of
their predictions bear certain striking similarities to Popcorn's.
How are we to account for this? Maybe the future is out there,
waiting for us to grab it with both hands and make the most of it,
just as our graduation speaker said it would be. In light of
AtmosFear, I suppose we should remember to wear rubber gloves.
</P>
<P>
   In the prediction business, it's not enough just to be able to
identify trends. You also have to be able to reinvent the language
for marketing purposes, to give trends catchy, media-seductive yet
somehow vaguely annoying terms. I think of it as Popcorning.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of ``Iconoculture'' clearly have taken a page from
Popcorn's books and invented Popcornisms galore. In
``Iconoculture,'' cocooning becomes bunkering, AtmosFear is
germonella, and pleasure revenge (``cutting loose and savoring
forbidden fruits'' like single malt Scotch and gourmet ice cream)
becomes vice versing.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Clicking'' Popcorn gives us, among many new terms,
EVEolution, for marketing to financially savvy women; mancipation,
marketing to the nonstereotypical male; down-aging, appealing to
those who won't allow age to dictate their behavior. The authors of
``Iconoculture'' are more than up to the Popcorn challenge with
terms such as eatertainment, the mania for theme restaurants;
Zentrepreneurism, for people who combine social activism with
business; beehiving, for the trend toward forming small communities
bound by shared interests _ like predicting the future, I suppose.
</P>
<P>
   After reading ``Clicking'' and ``Iconoculture'' back to back, I
was left with the impression that the authors of both books are, in
large part, pointing out the obvious. Of course, nobody ever went
broke doing that, myself included. It's practically a job
qualification in my line of work. Should I go into the prediction
business? Should I change my name, possibly to something snack-food
related? Dee Dee Dorito? It has a certain ring, but not the Popcorn
ring, I'm afraid.

GROUNDS FOR BACTERIA HYSTERIA UNDERLIE WIDENING RECALL OF MEATS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As more Americans trace illnesses to listeria-tainted processed
meats and more plants recall packaged products, health officials
worry openly about ``listeria hysteria.''
</P>
<P>
   But while some consumers are overreacting, feeling nauseous at
the sight of a hot dog, public health specialists say listeria
ho-hum would be far worse.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: This bacteria kills more than 20 percent of those it
strikes. Its serious victims are primarily pregnant women and
fetuses, the elderly, and those with a compromised immune system.
(Compare that to a death rate of less than 3 percent among those
who get food poisoning from salmonella and E. coli.)
</P>
<P>
   Every week, more sicknesses and deaths are being tied to a
particular strain of listeria found at a Michigan meat plant run by
Bil Mar, a subsidiary of the Sara Lee Corp. As of last week, 79
illnesses nationwide were linked to this Sara Lee plant, including
15 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Of that, five cases come from Massachusetts, including the death
of a fetus.
</P>
<P>
   And it's too early to know the full extent of listeria's recent
damage. Given its incubation period of anywhere from three to 70
days and an average incubation of three to four weeks, it could
still be some time before officials know the true extent of the
recent outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to consumer anxiety, the list of recalled products keeps
growing. In the past two weeks, Thorn Apple Valley and Oscar Mayer
announced listeria-related recalls. Together with Sara Lee's
recall, which was announced last month, the list includes such
brand names as Ball Park, Hygrade, Oscar Mayer, and Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   Deli managers are noticing customers' anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are asking lots of questions, such as what kind of
brands we sell,'' said Bobby DeDominicis, general manager of B &AMP; D
Deli in Brookline, Mass., which sells mostly the deli's own
prepared meats. ``I've noticed these questions more in the past
month.''
</P>
<P>
   But health officials say there's more information on listeria
that should settle some nerves. Most healthy people can ingest
listeria with no problem, perhaps just a mild stomach reaction.
</P>
<P>
   And while often fatal, the bacteria is relatively rare. About
1,800 serious listeria-related illnesses are reported nationwide
each year, said federal health officials. That compares to 40,000
cases nationwide of salmonella food poisoning, and 20,000 cases of
E. Coli-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   What is unusual about this year's outbreak is the ability of
health officials to identify a Michigan plant as the source. In
most years, listeria cases are logged in every state and the
sources are random. Last year in this state, there were 34
listeria-related deaths, with no one source identified.
</P>
<P>
   For now, public health officials are stepping up their warnings
about this bacteria for those with weak immune systems and women
who are pregnant. They are advising these groups to avoid eating
any kind of processed meats, as well as soft cheeses, such as brie,
in which listeria often hides.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a pregnant woman is healthy, health officials say she is
more prone to react strongly to listeria, and the bacteria can pass
to her fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials say they have long known that pregnant women
were vulnerable to listeria, but its rarity gave it low priority in
the list of warnings to this group.
</P>
<P>
   Until public health specialists understand the scope of the
problem, they urge the public to take precautions such as
re-cooking processed meats and cooking raw meat thoroughly. Because
this soil-based bacteria can also be found on vegetables, they urge
consumers to wash vegetables thoroughly before eating.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Kludt, epidemiology program coordinator for the
Massachusetts Department of Public Health, said people should also
practice general hygiene, washing their hands, knives, and cutting
boards after exposures to uncooked foods. Even watch the hygiene
practices of your local butcher or deli manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may be slicing meat on the same machine they used for the
Sara Lee meat,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
$1 mystery revealed
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that nothing is truly free, a Westwood, Mass. mother
grew understandably suspicious when she received a survey in the
mail with $1 in cold cash. It was clear the $1 was hers to keep,
whether she ultimately filled out the questionnaire or not.
</P>
<P>
   She worried that this was a guilt-inducing ploy to get her name
on a marketing list, which would trigger hundreds of annoying calls
and solicitations.
</P>
<P>
   The identity of the sender was vague. The survey, called the
``National Survey of Apparel Purchasing,'' asked questions about
how she chose and bought apparel. The questions included how many
children she had, her income, her educational background and
whether she took vacations outside the country.
</P>
<P>
   The three-sentence letter was from Frederick L. Barbour II,
president of The Barbour Group. A self-addressed return envelope
went to a place called ADE of Wisconsin in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was incredibly anonymous,'' she said. ``It raised my
antennae.''
</P>
<P>
   She asked us to check it out, and we did. After doing a
reverse-directory search of the address, we discover the ADE is
actually Accurate Data Entry, a company operated out of a basement
in Milwaukee. When we called, the receptionist said she knew about
the survey and promptly replied, ``Oh, it's for Lands' End.''
</P>
<P>
   So, we called Lands' End, the apparel mail-order business based
in Dodgeville, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Lands' End-sponsored survey,'' said Anna Schryver, a
company spokeswoman after checking with her marketing folks. ``It's
a blind survey. We don't want to bias the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed to make sense. But who is Frederick Barbour? Schryver
said he's an independent marketing consultant. We asked if he would
call us, just so we could ask about his $1 survey-completion
strategy. She said she'd leave a message for him, but couldn't give
us his number. We have yet to hear from him.
</P>

Infant carrier recall
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The US Consumer Product Safety Commission has announced the
recall of 240,000 ``Baby Bjorn'' infant carriers because infants
can fall out of the leg openings. Nine infants have slipped through
the openings, including six who suffered fractured skulls. The
carrier is made by Regal and Lager Inc. of Marietta, Ga.

THINK BEFORE YOU CURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VERONICA FLORES  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A group of adolescent girls that I work with know
my limits on abusive language: I don't want to hear them call each
other or anyone else ``stupid,'' much less anything worse.
</P>
<P>
   I and the other women who help with the group have explained to
them that we want them to show respect for one another. The sell is
tough with these spirited girls, especially when they're arguing
and, like so many adults, don't think before they hurl insults. So
it's with a great deal of curiosity last week that I watched a
Michigan town attempt to prosecute a man for cursing.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Boomer is charged with violating a 102-year-old Michigan
law when he cursed in front of a woman and two children after his
canoe tipped over Aug. 15 on the Rifle River near Standish.
According to news reports, Boomer loudly let loose with some choice
four-letter words.
</P>
<P>
   It's illegal in Michigan to ``use any indecent, immoral,
obscene, vulgar or insulting language in the presence or hearing of
any woman or child.''
</P>
<P>
   The act is illegal in Texas, too. The police call it
``disorderly conduct,'' although the law isn't specific to gender.
</P>
<P>
   A judge now is considering whether to drop the charges against
Boomer. Civil libertarians are challenging the case as a trampling
of the right to free speech. Whether or not you agree, it's most
certainly a demonstration of the decline in the nation's civility.
</P>
<P>
   While my observations are limited to my nearly 33 years of
living, the loss of grace seems to have begun before I arrived and
has accelerated since.
</P>
<P>
   While I don't swear like a sailor, I'm also no prude. Sometimes
only a four-letter word is befitting the pain of a stubbed toe.
However, I've always marveled at the restraint of a longtime friend
who invented her own swear word _ ``sugarfoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Cursing is as old as the devil. While many find it offensive,
some have found it intellectually stimulating. Mexican writer
Octavio Paz, for example, devotes the entire fifth chapter of
``Labyrinth of Solitude'' to an examination of a word this
newspaper can't print. Suffice to say it's been a fightin' word for
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   But at what point does cursing cross the line? For that matter,
is there a line? Hollywood and the boob tube so gratuitously push
the envelope with Jimmy Smits' bare butt and other similarly
salacious clips, the line becomes blurred before we can find it.
</P>
<P>
   Some Michigan residents who oppose the law that entangled Boomer
told reporters that those within earshot could simply just walk
away from the offensive language. They're right. But how do you
explain to children like those who heard Boomer that such language
is improper when so much of it is occurring around you?
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Boomer insisted that the incident was simply ``clean
fun.'' He's changing his tune, as the news media attention has
ratcheted up. ``It bothers me very much. It reflects badly on my
parents,'' he told the Detroit News. ``My parents didn't raise me
this way.''
</P>
<P>
   If only he'd thought of that before he opened his mouth.

BLACK HISTORY: GLEANING LESSONS FROM A LIFETIME 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CARY CLACK  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The train of history runs smoothly through the
memory of Edward Qualles, coasting along the tracks of his 96
years. For much of this century, and Qualles has lived through just
about all of it, the train has been part of black America, its
mournful whistle and rumbling journey a symbol to urban and rural
communities.
</P>
<P>
   For urban blacks living on the ``other side of the tracks,'' the
train was emblematic of the barriers separating them from the
larger community. For rural blacks, it was a reminder of a larger
world to explore.
</P>
<P>
   And for many blacks, Qualles included, the railroad was the
vehicle they rode into the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   February is ``Black History Month,'' when public attention is
paid to a history that is often ignored the rest of the year. But
black history, any history, isn't simply found in books and museums
or in the lives of famous people. History surrounds us every day in
the experiences and conversations of senior citizens such as
Qualles, people whose lives of dignity, honor and perseverance
enrich our lives.
</P>
<P>
   Qualles was born outside Greenwood, Miss., in 1903. He was
plowing the field at age 9 when someone told him that the Titanic
had sunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to go on a boat anyway,'' was his response.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen, he watched the Klan march through downtown Greenwood.
Not knowing that the light-complexioned youth was black, they
didn't bother him.
</P>
<P>
   Qualles laughs at the thought that he put one over on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I guess I did.''
</P>
<P>
   This was in the early 1920s. As he sits in his San Antonio home
today, a television report airs about the first day of the trial of
one of the men accused of killing a black man in Jasper, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Qualles attended Tougaloo College in Jackson, Miss. When George
Washington Carver came for a lecture, he helped the scientist set
up his exhibit. During his summers in college he began working as a
cook on the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad, known as the ``Katy.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating, he went to work full time for the railroad,
becoming the chef in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   ``The railroads had better paying jobs,'' he says. ``And you got
to travel.''
</P>
<P>
   He met the great black labor leader A. Philip Randolph, who
founded the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the first black
union, and who originated the idea for the March on Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by Randolph, Qualles helped organize Local 645 of the
Dining Car Employees and led them through two successful strikes.
</P>
<P>
   After the Katy stopped its dining car service in the mid-'60s,
Qualles became the assistant chef of the San Antonio Country Club
and the chef at other San Antonio eateries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cooked in every place that had a stove,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His mind still sharp, he reads and keeps up with current events.
He lives alone in the home he shared with his wife of 57 years,
Catherine, who died in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably the happiest and most gentle human being I've
ever known,'' says his friend Odell Couch, who checks on him daily.
</P>
<P>
   Qualles' advice to young people is to ``be literate. And you've
got to be literate in business, take care of business and prepare
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   So the train of history can keep moving forward.

<P>
   !! 1/2 ``The Hi-Lo Country'' Woody Harrelson satisfyingly fills
some pretty big boots here, playing a rip-roaring
last-of-a-dying-breed cowboy who returns from World War II to find
that the world he left is being gobbled up by big ranchers,
squeezing out independents like him. It's a colorful and likable
performance, but he's so much bigger than the characters
surrounding him that they seem inadequate. (R)
</P>
<P>
   !! ``She's All That'' Bright, above-average teensploitation
movie. Its plot is formulaic: Babe magnet bets his pals that he can
turn the most unpromising zero into a prom queen, only to find that
he falls in love with her. What makes it work is that it's unafraid
to try for real feelings. It nails them, thanks to a simpatico cast
led by Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachael Leigh Cook. Matthew Lillard
is a stitch as an airhead TV celeb who thinks he's a cool dancer.

STORIED ADVICE IN AVOIDING THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ This is a time when too much has been said too
often about the impeachment trial of President Clinton. The
endlessly repetitive talking heads on cable television, each hoeing
the old partisan ground again and again, are beginning to sound
like a lecture in the Tower of Babel.
</P>
<P>
   The nation waits, stupefied, observing this tiresome and no
longer instructive process winding toward what is heralded to be
the end. Yet no one can be certain when the curtain will finally
fall, as one day's implied agreement between the Senate Republicans
and Democrats evaporates the next day.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of this depressing state of affairs, I renewed a
longstanding search for some favorite books of my youth. I must
have devoured six or seven of the author's works, as quickly as
school work and other absorbing distractions of pre-teen years
permitted.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever I found myself in a library in recent years I would
pore through the catalog searching to find again these enjoyable
books. The search was complicated because I could not exactly
recollect the author's name.
</P>
<P>
   It was Altscheler or Altschuler, or something like that. But no
hunt, through card or computer, found anything resembling that name
and the subject he wrote about.
</P>
<P>
   His books were fictionalized histories of the Civil War's many
battles, written for young readers. But no specific title lodged in
memory, complicating the search.
</P>
<P>
   So for all this time, a kernel of dissatisfaction and
frustration abided. Recently, I turned to a visiting daughter and
her husband who heavily employ computers in their daily work, to
help find what so long had been elusive. It seemed particularly
apropos for a mood depressed by the impeachment's hollow oratory.
</P>
<P>
   To them, the problem was simple. Stefanie suggested using a
book-finding Web page and Paul helped me maneuver through the
necessary paths. There were some false turns to the Library of
Congress catalog, which, once I had gotten to it, with the kids
looking over my shoulder, I expected should definitely provide the
information. But because I lacked the precise name or a specific
title, this did not get me where I wanted to go.
</P>
<P>
   In describing the books to Paul and what they had meant to me so
many years ago, how much history they had helped me learn in their
pleasurable way, I recalled that one book was about a General
Thomas, who became known as the Rock of Chickamauga, for his
tenacious stand against the Confederates in Tennessee in 1863.
</P>
<P>
   That lead took us to a search engine Stefanie used
(www.bibliofind.com).
</P>
<P>
   Chickamauga produced an extremely long list of book titles, but
none written by anything resembling the author's name as I
remembered it.
</P>
<P>
   We went on to a second page and ran into good luck. In the
middle of that listed we found a bookshop in Ashville, N.Y., that
had a copy of ``Rock of Chickamauga,'' by a writer named Joseph
Altsheler.
</P>
<P>
   A breakthrough at long last, and a bit of vindication for the
powers of memory to survive the decades. With the name Joseph
Altsheler in hand, correctly spelled, we turned to the search again
and found a listing of 50 books, including at least seven on Civil
War battles and subjects. Joseph Altsheler, it turns out, also
wrote extensively about the American West and Indians, about World
War I, among other subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did a long search finally end in success, but having a
fulfilling experience using the Internet to find something that you
really wanted keenly to find, and could not accomplish any other
way, was a satisfaction second only to rediscovering Altsheler's
writings.
</P>
<P>
   It was a welcome contrast to previous attempts to use the
computer to find useful or necessary information expeditiously. All
previous disappointments were overcome. This was a high point that
lightened and lifted the spirit and was a reminder that in the
muddles of public discourses, small victories, personally
meaningful, can still be won.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the sense of accomplishment of finally having success
correctly using the computer. It's enough to steel you for the next
impeachment round.

IMANI ALL MINE 
By Connie Porter 
Houghton Mifflin, 212 pp., $23 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imani looks just like her mama.
</P>
<P>
   She has the same squib of a nose, the same lips, the same wide,
flat fingers. Her mama, Tasha, sees it, sees it every time she
holds Imani _ even if others think the baby may favor her daddy,
whose name Tasha won't even speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what nobody say, who they say they might see in
her. It's only me in her,'' Tasha says, with a hint of defiance.
``When I be getting up with her at night, it be my own face looking
back at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Imani's mother is a 15-year-old high school student.
</P>
<P>
   We've all seen, if not known, girls like Tasha. They're at bus
stops and train stations, in malls and in city parks, popping gum
and pushing baby strollers. A heady combination of attitude and
innocence, they are the faces behind the statistics and headlines
about children having children. Often they elicit onlookers'
disapproval or pitying clucks of the tongue rather than
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   But what makes Tasha, the heartbreaking narrator of ``Imani All
Mine,'' memorable is author Connie Porter's sympathetic but
unsentimental portrayal of a teenage mother. Porter neither
endorses nor condemns teen motherhood; she simply presents its
matter-of-fact realities through the stark, almost poetic
vernacular of Tasha, a teenager raised on the uncompromising
streets of inner-city Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   As with most teenagers, Tasha's pregnancy was unplanned. Given a
choice, she would never have become a statistic; she was raped by a
knife-wielding teenage boy whose attention earned her trust.
Ashamed, she kept her pregnancy a secret from her mother, Earlene,
for most of her term, concealing her body with baggy sweatshirts
and pants. Once her mother discovers the pregnancy _ one morning,
while Tasha is getting dressed for school, Earlene notices the
telltale swell of her daughter's breasts and belly _ it's clear why
Tasha withheld her news. Earlene flies into a rage, hitting her
daughter across the face.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the hell wrong with you? What were you thinking about,
doing this?'' Earlene asks, each question punctuated with a slap.
``Why you ain't tell me? Why you ain't tell me? Why you ain't tell
me?'' In her own way, Earlene means well. She wants more for Tasha
than the single motherhood that truncated her own life.
</P>
<P>
   When her mother asks the name of the father, Tasha falls silent.
``I just curled myself around my baby. I couldn't say his name to
Mama. I couldn't even say it to myself.'' Later that day, while
Tasha is sitting in her second-period math class, her water breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Once the child is born, Tasha falls in love with her daughter
straightaway. This baby is someone who needs her, someone she can
call her own. When she first holds the baby, she stares at the
child ``to see who was in her face,'' and is reassured when it
``was only me I seen there.''
</P>
<P>
   She christens her daughter, Imani, an African word for
``faith.'' Tasha continues her studies in a high school where so
many students have babies that on-site day care is provided. She
juggles a life of exams, gym classes, and 2 a.m. feedings. She
loves her daughter, but at times reacts violently when the child
won't stop crying.
</P>
<P>
   Tasha's flashes of fury reflect the violence outside her window,
where rap songs exploding from boom boxes take the place of
whispered lullabies. Her neighborhood is ruled by the drug dealers
who dangle different brands of sneakers from telephone wires to
advertise their illicit wares. Random gunfire scars the silence of
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``They be shooting around here sometimes at night,'' Tasha says.
``Pop pop. Like firecrackers.''
</P>
<P>
   Porter's use of black street idioms, as well the book's
narration by an African-American girl who arches her back against
hardship, may remind some of ``Push,'' Sapphire's intense,
overpraised 1996 novel. It's a lazy comparison. Honest and
unpretentious, ``Imani All Mine'' doesn't revel in trying to shock
its audience with its harsh depictions. Porter has a firmer grasp
on her characters' essential humanity. They emerge as true, whether
it is Mrs. Poole, the teacher who imparts parenting advice to her
students, or Earlene's ingratiating white boyfriend, Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   Though the violence near the book's conclusion is inevitable, it
is no less shattering. Yet as in her acclaimed first novel,
``All-Bright Court,'' Porter sifts hope from the ashes. She finds
grace notes in her characters' dogged endurance, always letting
light shine through lamentable lives.

`PEACE NUTS' VS. THE `SCHOOL OF ASSASSINS' 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In 1990, when he staged his first protest
against the School of the Americas at Fort Benning, Ga., the Rev.
Roy Bourgeois was joined by about 10 friends and colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   In November, for the ninth annual School of the Americas Watch
rally, the Maryknoll priest had a little more company.
</P>
<P>
   Some 7,000 people showed up _ 2,319 of whom peacefully
trespassed onto the U.S. Army base.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went through some real desert years,'' Bourgeois said. ``It
was so cold during our 40-day fast on the steps of the Capitol, we
could never get warm. But we learned you just gotta hang in there
and be faithful. Now we've reached a moment where the movement to
close the school has really taken root.''
</P>
<P>
   A recap of the desert years must include the seven prison
sentences (nearly four years of incarceration) that Bourgeois, 60,
has served for his civil disobedience. Several other priests, nuns
and lay activists have been locked up as often.
</P>
<P>
   One 18-month stint, spent in a federal pen in Minnesota, was
Bourgeois' punishment for a particularly inventive crime.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing an Army surplus store uniform, he walked onto the Fort
Benning base, climbed a pine tree and hid until lights-out. Then,
using a boom box, he blasted a platoon of Salvadoran recruits
inside the school's barracks with a tape of a speech for peace by
the late Oscar Romero.
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop of El Salvador, Romero was slain in 1980 while
celebrating Mass. The military mind behind his killing and hundreds
of other political murders was the leader of the Salvadoran death
squads, Roberto D'Aubuisson _ a graduate of the School of the
Americas who died in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Founded by the U.S. Army in 1946 to train Latin American
soldiers to defend against ``instability'' in their countries, the
school moved in 1984 from Panama to Fort Benning near Columbus, Ga.
It carried with it its nicknames, ``School of the Assassins'' and
``School of the Coups.''
</P>
<P>
   Also among its 60,000 grads is former Panamanian Gen. Manuel
Noriega (currently serving a 40-year prison sentence in Florida for
drug dealing).
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Freedom of Information Act, the U.N. Truth
Commission and their own persistence, Bourgeois and his associates
say they have documented proof that at least one of every 100
School of the Americas graduates has returned home to such
countries as Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador or Colombia, ``not to
promote democracy, but to rape, kill, torture and participate in
massacres.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The school keeps saying there are only a few graduates who've
done these things,'' Bourgeois said. ``But, it's not one or two or
three. If one of every 100 graduates of, say, Boston College goes
on to kill, rape and torture, don't you think somebody's going to
shut down that school and investigate?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, a Defense Department study confirmed the existence of a
long-rumored training manual that advised students about the
efficacy of blackmail, beatings, torture, false imprisonment,
executions and bounties for enemy dead.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Pentagon declassified the manual, providing the
School of the Americas Watch with some potent evidence. Since then,
leaders of the school have emphasized that such tactics are no
longer taught, that changes have been made, including a mandatory
course in human rights. They maintain that the school is just the
symbol of a much larger agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Bourgeois agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The starting point of this issue is really not the School of
the Assassins,'' he said. ``The point is the reality in Latin
America, one in which the majority of people struggle in poverty
just to survive. For so long, Latin American militaries have been
defending a socio-economic system that keeps the rich rich and the
poor poor. And we (the United States) have helped them. Our policy
there is not a pretty picture.''
</P>
<P>
   In the big picture, courses in human rights seem absurd.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we look at the SOA curriculum, we don't see these
soldiers being taught the skills that will let them return to their
countries to help heal the wounds of poverty and political
oppression,'' the priest said. ``If the army really wants to teach
them democracy, it should shut that school down and send some of
those soldiers to American universities.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourgeois received a Purple Heart as a Naval officer in Vietnam
before he was ordained in 1972. In 1989, after he learned that
several School of the Americas graduates were linked to the murders
of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her 15-year-old
daughter in El Salvador, he moved into a small apartment across the
street from Fort Benning.
</P>
<P>
   To him, ``This is really not a complicated issue.'' And that
simplicity, he believes, accounts for the exponential growth in the
number of his fellow protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Told that his group's self-sacrificing obsession with the School
of the Americas might be viewed by some as a mission of peace nuts,
Bourgeois laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are nuts to want to help the poor, to try to
alleviate suffering, to feel compassion for their brothers and
sisters in Latin America, we need more nuts,'' he said. ``Give me
the nuts.''

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It seems like a century ago we had that other
interminable trial of the century.
</P>
<P>
   My wife was glued to every word of Marcia Clark and Johnnie
Cochran. She watched gloves fail to fit and a jury acquit.
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't been following the current trial of the century at
all. ``I don't do politics,'' she said. ``I do lurid.''
</P>
<P>
   Debby is representative of the American people, unlike her
husband, who is fascinated at watching the ship of state go down
with more idiocy and pomposity than James Cameron put into his
doomed ocean liner.
</P>
<P>
   If Monica Lewinsky's testimony is aired, will Debby watch?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll watch,'' she said immediately. ``It'll be fun to match
the voice to the face. Didn't we hear her taped conversations? But
we didn't see her lips moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Please insert your own joke here, because I won't.
</P>
<P>
   I actually admire Lewinsky, the most famous and incompletely
understood young woman in the world.
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase House impeachment prosecutor Bill McCollum,
R-Fla., I hope to look into her eyes during Senate testimony so I
can more completely understand her.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some House prosecutors, I plan not to have dirty
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Why do I admire Lewinsky? For one thing, I liked some of her
humor in the tapes made by her evil turncoat fake friend, Linda
Tripp. At one point Lewinsky told Tripp that President Clinton had
said he wouldn't have gotten involved with her if he had known what
kind of person she was.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Expletive) him and the little motorcade he rode in on,''
Lewinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Score one for the intern.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly I admire Lewinsky because if I were in her place, I would
have committed suicide two days after my name became a joke, or
after the 100th airing of the hugging-in-the-beret tape _ whichever
came first.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard enough to grow up with weird parents in a 90210ish ZIP
code. It must be hell on a young brain to have a president, and
then an entire nation, go dysfunctional over you.
</P>
<P>
   How would you like to be the most famous woman in the world, and
for that?
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky has gumption just to keep sneaking past reporters to go
clubbing and drinking Cosmopolitans like any upper-middle-class
young woman who didn't have an affair with the president _ if there
are any.
</P>
<P>
   She gets picked on for trivial and sexist things, like her
designer-logo headgear, her old-fashioned figure and her big hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hair some of us with skinny hair would like,'' my wife
said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it's tasteful Brentwood big hair, not the double-wide
big hair Clinton usually favors.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky is a good-looking woman, and most of the people who
make jokes about her looks should do so well.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky is a Rubenesque Rorschach for Americans. We see in her
what we want. She can represent the good girl, the bad girl, the
stalker or the seduced. Whatever she is, she's another celebrity
with a book deal. She's no victim. Readers will be.
</P>
<P>
   A group of young feminists recently wrote an essay for the
Nation magazine saying Lewinsky was a model independent woman, who
did what she wanted with her body and an older man in a position of
power.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, being sane, is reserving judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to be impressed by her honesty and composure,'' she
said. ``We all want her not to be a bimbo.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently I looked up ``bimbo'' in my dictionary of slang, and
discovered that at the beginning of the century it also applied to
men. We ought to revive that sense of the word.
</P>
<P>
   Bubba is the bimbo here.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton can parade around the country like a respectable
Republican, promising to build Star Wars missile defense systems
and save Social Security by investing it in Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky can't defend herself. Yet.
</P>
<P>
   When the Tripp tapes were played in November, reporters
delighted in making fun of Lewinsky's speech, commenting on her
whininess, the extent of her vocabulary and all of her ``likes.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all kids don't use them.
</P>
<P>
   ``She will be different in front of an audience,'' my wife said.
``I'm sure I'm just as hesitant in phone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'll speak differently in front of the panel, or whatever
they're calling themselves _ the impeachers.''
</P>
<P>
   You have to love it. Debby is so willfully ignorant of the
invent-the-rules, Calvinball impeachment trial that she doesn't
know that right-wing congressmen have renamed themselves
``impeachment managers.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows the important moniker, though, and bring her on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, God, the drama,'' Debby said. ``We have no control over
what she says. It'll be like what _ football? _ not a play where
you know what words she'll use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kick this thing back up to the level of O.J.,'' Debby said.
``They'd better televise it.''
</P>
<P>
   I agree. What else is the point of our entire culture right now?
</P>

PLAYING FOR KEEPS 
Michael Jordan and the World He Made 
By David Halberstam. Random House. 426 pp. Illustrated. $24.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sports Illustrated suggested his retirement was the equivalent
of Shakespeare hanging up his pen. Newsweek declared: ``No Heirs to
Air Jordan.'' The Weekly Standard, a journal of conservative
politics, compared him to William Tecumseh Sherman and Bill Gates.
And for the sake of avoiding blasphemy, we won't even catalog the
references to him as some kind of deity.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the onslaught of superlatives that greeted the retirement
of the greatest hoopster/marketer/crossover celebrity ever to lace
on a pair of sneakers, author David Halberstam has attempted not
just to celebrate Michael Jordan's legacy, but to explain it.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Playing for Keeps,'' which admirably details Jordan the
phenomenon while leaving us thirsting for more of Jordan the man,
Halberstam lays out the fearsome dimensions of that legacy. In
1983, the season before Jordan arrived in the pros, the Chicago
Bulls won 27 games; by the time he left, they had won six National
Basketball Association championships. In 1978, NBA players earned a
total of about $40 million in salary; 20 years later, that number
was roughly $1 billion. (Jordan himself earned around $80 million
last year, on and off the court.) In 1984, when Jordan was a
rookie, Nike had revenues of slightly over $900 million; by 1998,
Jordan's sneaker company was taking in more than $9 billion. And
while superstars like Larry Bird and Magic Johnson deserve plenty
of credit, too, it was during Jordan's tenure that the NBA
transformed itself from a league that mainstream America feared as
too black and too playground into a family-friendly, mega-marketing
wonder.
</P>
<P>
   All this in a remarkable basketball career bookended by Jordan's
NCAA-championship-winning jump shot for the University of North
Carolina in 1982 and his NBA-title-winning jump shot for the Bulls
against Utah in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Had the title not been taken, Halberstam could have called this
book ``1984.'' For it is in that year, he posits, that a harmonic
convergence anointed Jordan as ``the signature commercial
representative of this great new athletic-cultural-commercial
empire.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1984, writes Halberstam, that a five-year old cable
network called ESPN _ which revolutionized sports televison _
``truly came of age.'' At the same time, David Stern _ the driven,
creative son of a Manhattan deli owner _ was becoming NBA
commissioner and a tough, aggressive sports lawyer named David Falk
was becoming an important force in the balance of power between
owners and players. And of course, 1984 was the year Michael Jordan
entered the league.
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam characterizes Jordan as the athlete who penetrated
more ``deeply into the psyche of the American public'' than any
other sports star. (In the warm afterglow of his current status as
tragic hero, people tend to forget that the young Muhammad Ali was
a divisive figure in this society). But he also makes it clear that
aside from being the right man at the right time, Jordan was a
one-in-a-million man.
</P>
<P>
   The ``epiphany'' occurred, the book proclaims, one night in 1984
when the young Jordan turned the heads of the all-white clientele
at a restaurant in Portland, Ore. As the athlete returned their
stares with an easy smile, ``race simply fell away,'' Halberstam
writes. ``Michael was no longer a black man, he was just someone
you wanted to be with.'' This appeal would translate into the
unforgettable ``be like Mike'' commercial spots.
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam, the much-honored journalist, cultural historian, and
author of 16 books, is at his best populating ``Playing for Keeps''
with Jordan's supporting cast. There is Phil Jackson, the Zen-like
coach of the Bulls, struggling to balance his own 1960s free spirit
with his parents' religious fundamentalism. Dean Smith, the great
North Carolina coach who molded Jordan, is a pillar of avuncular
rectitude, demanding that his players attend church unless they
have a note from their parents. And Halberstam weighs in on the
heated debate over which Jerry _ Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf or
Bulls general manager Jerry Krause _ is the bigger jerk. (In his
book, the insecure yet egomaniacal Krause wins hands down.)
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam also succeeds in giving us the basic craggy, Mount
Rushmore portrait of Jordan. He is the product of a strong and
nurturing family, the beneficiary of a wonderful North Carolina
basketball program, and the possessor of an almost incomprehensible
desire to drive himself to the pinnacle of success.
</P>
<P>
   Tales of his insane will to win abound. When Bulls teammate Dave
Corzine consistently whips him at Pac-Man, Jordan actually buys a
machine and practices until he can beat his tormentor. He is the
kind of guy who is willing to bribe an airport baggage handler to
win a bet from unsuspecting teammates over whose luggage will come
down the chute first.
</P>
<P>
   His toughness, often tinged with nastiness, is equally
legendary. In the 1992 NBA finals, Jordan _ angered by speculation
that Portland guard Clyde Drexler was his near-equal as a player _
responded by draining six straight three-point shots against the
helpless Drexler. But he was just as intense in preseason practice,
once retaliating against a rookie who had gotten a little physical
with him by knocking him cold with a well-placed elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Where ``Playing for Keeps'' has problems is in getting deeper
inside Jordan's head. Part of this can be attributed to the fact
that Halberstam never got to sit down with Jordan. But even so,
there are some glaring gaps in this portrait that are too easily
glossed over. Serious gambling problems cited by Halberstam _
including a five-day run of $165,000 in losses to some card-playing
and golfing partners, and hundreds of thousands in golf debts
racked up in another 10-day period _ are conveniently chalked up to
what Jordan's father called ``a competitiveness problem.''
</P>
<P>
   More disturbing is Halberstam's softness in dealing with the
matter of Jordan's detachment from politics and social issues, his
reluctance to squander any commercial capital for a cause. Take his
decision not to endorse Harvey Gantt, a civil rights leader trying
to unseat US Senator Jesse Helms, the conservative Republican who
is anathema to many of the African-Americans in Jordan's home
state. But Republicans purchase Nikes as well, Jordan noted
pointedly. In the few pages in which Halberstam addresses the
matter, he basically gives Jordan an uncontested layup.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's views on the ``black condition,'' Halberstam writes,
are evident in ``the way he played in big games under unrelenting
pressure, the way he comported himself on and off the court in
front of the most intrusive media scrutiny in modern history,'' and
in ``how shrewd a businessman he had become.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which reinforces the inevitable conclusion that it was
Jordan's sheer excellence as a player _ not his spirituality or
even his agreeable personality _ that is responsible for his
reshaping the sport. In the wake of his departure, he leaves a
league torn asunder by labor-management disagreements serious
enough to produce a lockout, by diminishing public interest, and by
the obvious lack of a successor. The man one player called ``Jesus
in Nikes'' has left the court. And as Halberstam makes eminently
clear, there is neither a new messiah _ nor the conditions that
could give rise to one _ on the horizon.

HEAVEN IS WITHIN REACH ABOVE LAKE TAHOE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. _ It feels pretty much like cheating _
taking the Aerial Tramway up the face of Gunbarrel Run, then the
Sky Express to the rim, at 10,000 feet, looking down across the
vast cobalt-blue expanse of Lake Tahoe, backed by snow-flecked
forest and an azure sky.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, this is definitely cheating. Anybody who has climbed
mountains knows that getting a view like this is supposed to
require dramatic personal sacrifice. That is what it takes, for
instance, to reach the summit of 9,735-foot Mount Tallac, set on
the southwest rim of the Tahoe Basin, which overlooks Lake Tahoe
and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   But not at Heavenly, the world-class ski resort at South Lake
Tahoe, set within minutes (by shuttle) of slick casinos. By tram,
it is just minutes to some of the most eye-popping views anywhere
in the West.
</P>
<P>
   For years, I avoided the place because it just seemed too
yuppie, too crowded, too fast-paced for a backwoods kind of guy,
but I've been won over this winter. What has done it are two
visits, two winners, and views that speak with a thousand quiet
voices.
</P>
<P>
   The best time to visit is between Sunday and Thursday, when the
casinos have less than 100 percent occupancy. That is the only time
significant discounts are available at South Lake for lodging. That
is also when the runs are less than packed, and when even an
average schusser can enjoy the moments without feeling pressure
from the warp-speed types.
</P>
<P>
   And right there is what makes the board or ski experience at
Heavenly the best in the Tahoe Basin. The place is simply so big,
covering such a vast amount of terrain, that your average bear can
find a virtually unlimited number of runs to suit her skill level.
</P>
<P>
   Heavenly has 4,800 skiable acres that straddle the
California-Nevada border _ more than any other ski area in the far
West _ 82 runs, 27 lifts, and the longest mountain descent in the
far West, 5.5 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the place is set up for intermediate skiers and
boarders, making it ideal for the maximum number of people, and
with high-speed trams, quads and lifts, they are delivered quickly
to the promised land.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the place has won me over this winter is because of
its sheer size and the speed of the lifts, which diffuse the number
of people on the mountain. Another is that by making visits during
the week, and when there are not holidays, I've avoided the crowds
and the high-ticket lodging.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that I just got married here to my long-lost college
sweetheart, in a beautiful little chapel overlooking the lake,
minister and all. Yeah, that could definitely have something to do
with it. But, hey, after all, no place is prettier in winter than
Tahoe.
</P>
<P>
   Every trip should start with a lodging reservation (either
direct to a casino, or to the Tahoe Reservation Line at
800-288-2463) and a phone call to get the latest on road conditions
(800-426-7623).
</P>
<P>
   I've driven U.S. 50 in all conditions, including white-out
blizzards, and you simply must make certain that your driving
skills and your vehicle can handle anything before heading up the
hill beyond Placerville, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Always stop in Placerville and fill up your gas tank. In case
there is a long jam-up near the summit from an accident, which
occasionally occurs, this way you will be able to keep your engine
running to stay warm without running out of gas.
</P>
<P>
   Tahoe is the crown jewel of skiing in the West, and Heavenly is
the best of the best; and hence, a ski holiday can be a pricey
ticket, adding up lodging ($75 to $150 and up per night), lift
tickets ($106 per day for two) and meals ($50 and up for two per
day). That's roughly $250 to $300 per day, not counting travel
expenses and equipment rentals.
</P>
<P>
   Once you catch a glimpse of the view, though, little seems to
matter. There are many ways to take in that spectacle and then
experience the sheer exhilaration of heading down a run,
occasionally stopping to slow down the experience and absorb the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   To make it work, Heavenly has three main base-level staging
areas, two in Nevada and one in California. From any of these, you
take a tram (California Lodge), a quad (Stagecoach Lodge) or a lift
(Boulder Lodge) up the hill to mid-level staging areas. Here you
take lifts to higher elevations and to a network of runs, lifts and
four on-the-mountain lodges.
</P>
<P>
   The pinnacle of them all is the Skyline Trail, which starts on
the mountain rim, reachable by the Sky Express, with more than 10
intermediate routes and one black diamond available to get back
down.
</P>
<P>
   For non-skiers, you can take the Aerial Tramway ($14) from
California Lodge up across the face of the famous Gunbarrel Run,
and then to the Top of the Tram Lodge. A beer and a cup of wine
will cost $10 here. A half hour later, you realize you just paid
$38 for two, and for what? Why, for that view, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it is priceless, and getting here without having to
walk is definitely cheating.

RENEE FLEMING MAKES HER SOLO MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Renee Fleming shines as the brightest soprano star in opera
today. But she's arrived at a period in her career and in her
personal life when she wants to concentrate more on recital
appearances, which are less time-consuming _ if hardly less
labor-intensive. Fleming's daughters, 6 and 3, are now in school
and preschool in Connecticut and not as portable as they used to
be; Fleming wants to stick near home so she can spend more time
with them.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the soprano is a born recitalist. When she sang in
Seiji Ozawa Hall at Tanglewood two summers ago, Andre Previn went
on record saying that it was the best vocal recital he'd heard in
his life. Fleming is now near the end of the American segment of
her first major international recital tour (14 concerts in all).
</P>
<P>
   After Fleming sang a Friday matinee performance of Haydn's ``The
Creation'' with James Levine and the Boston Symphony last December,
she unwound with coffee and pastry in her hotel lounge and talked
about her life and career. She was happy with the performance she'd
just sung. ``Singing `The Creation' is like sending your voice to
Canyon Ranch. I jumped at the chance, because I'd never sung the
whole thing before, although I studied the arias when I was in
graduate school and sang one or two of the solos. My first manager
was exclusively interested in opera, so that's where I started and
where I stayed, so far. I've had little opportunity to sing in
oratorio _ believe it or not, I've never sung `Messiah.' '' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A glamorous image &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fleming creates a glamorous image onstage, but she leaves it
there; she's very down to earth, not to say streetwise, about her
career. She's a worker, and that's why she has continued to develop
and improve during the dozen years since her first appearances as
Frasquita in ``Carmen'' and Belle in Thea Musgrave's ``A Christmas
Carol'' at the Virginia Opera in 1986; most careers can be charted
only in terms of decline once celebrity is reached.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it's been easy. More than once, Fleming has been in the
wrong place in the wrong role at the wrong time, even since
arriving at the very top of her profession. That moment can
probably be dated 1994, when Sir Georg Solti cast her in concert
performances of Mozart's ``Cosi fan tutte'' that led to London
Records signing her as an exclusive artist _ the first American
singer London had signed to such a contract since Marilyn Horne,
more than 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming's parents, both music teachers, had warned her that
performing was a risky career. At New York's Potsdam State College,
she majored in music education: ``My parents said, `Don't even
think about a performance degree.' '' Fleming's first important
teacher was Patricia Misslin, who encouraged what has remained a
career-long interest in contemporary music. After hours Fleming
sang with a jazz trio and astonished famous professional jazz
musicians with her command of the idiom. (Next month, she will
record her first jazz album.) After graduating from Potsdam State,
Fleming did graduate work at the Eastman School of Music in
Rochester before moving on to the Juilliard School, where she
started studying with Beverley Johnson, who remains her teacher
today.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '80s, Fleming won a Fulbright grant to study in
Europe with soprano Arleen Auger and the collaborative pianist
Hartmut Hoell. Praised for her articulate and even trills in ``The
Creation,'' Fleming accepted the compliment on Auger's behalf.
``She showed me how she did it, and then I could do it too. She was
a wonderful singer and teacher. The work I did that year with
Hartmut Hoell is what makes it possible for me to be a serious
recitalist today. To study with someone like that was so thrilling
and so instructive; he's a genius. Helen Yorke, the pianist with
whom I sang at Tanglewood, also worked with him at that time. It
was very intense, and both of us adored it. That year I really
learned to speak German; the other languages have come in since.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Demoralizing classes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At this same time, Fleming participated in master classes with
the legendary retired diva Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, an experience
that she found demoralizing although she feels that some press
accounts of this episode have been ``blown up way out of
proportion. What Schwarzkopf had to offer was tremendous, but the
technical aspects of what she was asking for I was not able to do
until much later. I don't think she was in tune with the level of
student she was working with. I still love her singing.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleming came back from Europe with some vocal problems; she was
trying to put her voice into a straitjacket _ later she remarked,
``I didn't have any vocal problems, so I invented some.''
Nevertheless, her career began to take off when she sang the
Countess in ``The Marriage of Figaro'' for Houston Opera in 1988;
it became one of her signature roles, and she sang it everywhere.
As her career expanded, so did a measure of controversy: She seemed
a competent but generic soprano, though one with an uncommonly
pretty voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people may not have counted on,'' Fleming says, ``is that
I am a voracious learner, and that I was working in the most
methodical way to improve; I would say that the first 10 years I
worked with Beverley Johnson were almost entirely spent on
technical work. When I started out, I had no high notes and I
couldn't sing softly; now I do, and now I can. Now I'm on a
maintenance program, and technique is not the complete focus of my
work. I'm interested in my emotional development and in the
expressive power of singing.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleming's first years were filled with exploratory ventures. She
performed roles she doesn't think she'll sing again, like Konstanze
in Mozart's ``The Abduction From the Seraglio'' and Eva in ``Die
Meistersinger,'' and a lot of one-off parts for special occasions.
``Now I want to stop adding so many roles, and want to repeat them
instead, and, hopefully, improve on them. But I don't want to get
typecast as a specialist, as a Mozart-Strauss singer, for example;
I'd be missing out on too much.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Problems at La Scala &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I can stretch,'' says Fleming, in understatement. She has
excelled in coloratura roles of the bel canto period, and she plans
to keep performing them, though she ran afoul of the claque at La
Scala when she sang Donizetti's ``Lucrezia Borgia'' last fall. ``I
loved the opera, the cast, the rehearsal period. And who knows what
caused it all, except that it was organized, and it was basically
five or six guys in the audience _ but five or six very loud ones.
There was no problem with the general audience, which was screaming
for these guys to come downstairs. I was able to black it out and
sing, but it wasn't easy to get back onstage for the next
performance.'' Fleming didn't sing the whole run of ``Lucrezia
Borgia,'' but she'll fling down the gantlet Feb. 8 when she takes
her recital program to the stage of La Scala.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming's bel canto roles include ``Il Pirata,'' ``Maria
Padilla,'' ``La Sonnambula,'' ``Il viaggio a Reims,'' and ``La
Straniera.'' She has recorded ``Rosamunda d'Inghilterra'' and, in
live performance, Rossini's ``Armida,'' a role most sopranos since
Callas have avoided (she confesses that she loves to listen to some
of her own daredevil feats on Sony's live recording of the opera).
She has sung many of the Mozart/Strauss favorites as well, and made
Dvorak's ``Russalka'' into another signature role. Among her
contemporary operas are Corigliano's ``The Ghosts of Versailles,''
Susa's ``The Dangerous Liaisons,'' and Andre Previn's ``A Streetcar
Named Desire'' (``It's like singing two Salomes back to back, but I
love it _ you would never guess it was anyone's very first
opera''). Her French operas to date include ``Manon,'' ``Thais,''
``Herodiade,'' ``La Dame Blanche,'' and ``Faust,'' with ``Louise''
on the way. Her next recording is ``Star-Cross'd Lovers,'' an album
with Placido Domingo of love duets from Shakespeare operas paired
with the parallel scenes acted by Lynn Redgrave and Timothy Dalton.
</P>
<P>
   Her anchor through all of this, Fleming has often said, has been
her home life and marriage to actor Richard Ross, though the couple
is now in the middle of a painful divorce. That was one unstated
reason the soprano withdrew from the Metropolitan Opera's new
production of Verdi's ``La Traviata'' late last fall. Naturally
some people attributed this cancellation to diva whim, but few
divas appear less whimsical than Renee Fleming. ``Bad behavior,
makeup, practicing kicking your train in front of the mirror _ I
think there are more important ways to be a diva than this. It's
about the music, not about the ego. What matters is what happens
when you open your mouth to sing; you should give joy to people,
you should touch somebody's heart. When I listen to someone sing, I
want to be touched spiritually. Right now, I am concerned about
being who I am, about continuing to grow, about seeing where it
will all go.''

ICE CLIMBING IN ADIRONDACKS BECOMES A HOT PASSION

   KEENE, N.Y. _ Ice-climbing guide Nick Yardley knew the right
face of Pitchoff Mountain would be crowded on a recent Saturday
morning. So in order to save prime parking for the nine students in
his beginning ice climbing seminar, he sent a helper ahead to shoo
away other cars from the tiny pullout on the side of state Route
73.
</P>
<P>
   Once parked, we climbed up the steep snow, wearing clunky
plastic climbing boots and rigid, 12-point crampons that bite into
the ice. At the base of the cliffs, there were three ropes already
set up for us to tie into. Within the hour, two other groups
arrived, and every conceivable route on the ice face had a climber
on it, crampons on each foot and high-tech, pick-shaped ice axes in
each hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be prepared to be miserable,'' the Welshman warned us when we
first met. ``You're going to spend the day either freezing to death
or sweating profusely.''
</P>
<P>
   Misery must love company, because an awful lot of people are ice
climbing these days. We were here for the third annual Adirondack
International Mountaineering Festival on Jan. 16 and 17. But crowds
on Adirondack ice is becoming the rule here, even on normal
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   These days, instead of finding virgin ice on popular routes,
climbers are finding the frozen flows and waterfalls turned into
pegboards by the dozens of climbers who preceded them. Some climbs
are becoming a nearly mindless activity of putting your ax blade in
holes made by the climber before you.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the downfalls of success, climbers say. The
popularity that resulted in the overwhelming success of the
Mountaineering Festival also has led to lines at the base of
climbs.
</P>
<P>
   Ice climbing, despite the inherent dangers and expensive gear,
is threatening to become as mainstream as rock climbing, its
warm-weather cousin. So many climbers attended the festival that a
Saturday night slide show was packed nearly to capacity. They so
overwhelmed an all-you-can-eat pasta dinner that dozens of climbers
had to stand and wait while cooks hustled to a nearby grocery store
to pick up more food.
</P>
<P>
   What this shows, climbers here say, is that the climbing world
at large finally is starting to notice the Adirondacks after
decades of ignoring the region in upstate New York. Climbers came
to the mountaineering festival from as far as Washington, D.C., to
take lessons from some of the world's greatest alpinists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most congested day (on ice routes) in the history
of the Adirondacks,'' said Don Mellor, a guide and author of
``Climbing in the Adirondacks,'' a bible for anyone who attempts
vertical routes here.
</P>
<P>
   Mellor, who taught a popular seminar called ``Steep Ice for the
Weak and Chicken-hearted,'' said he thought a mountain festival was
a stupid idea three years ago. He was contacted by his friend Vinny
McClelland, the festival co-organizer and owner of the Mountaineer
outdoor equipment store.
</P>
<P>
   Mellor wondered: How many people would come all the way up to
the Adirondacks to celebrate mountain climbing? A lot, it turned
out.
</P>
<P>
   This year, more than 300 climbers made their way north to help
raise money for local fire departments and non-profit groups like
the Access Fund, a group dedicated to keeping climbing areas around
the country open to climbers.
</P>
<P>
   Classes ranged from snowshoeing to advanced ice-climbing to
learning how to travel safely in avalanche country. And, for those
of us who have never ice-climbed before, a class for beginners.
</P>
<P>
   After a few minutes of instructions, we were gripping ice tools
and confidently shoving crampons into the ice. Yardley, a guide in
North Conway, N.H., was full of tips:
</P>
<P>
   Put your entire arm into driving the ice tool forward. Look for
dishes in the ice, which are stronger than bulges and won't shatter
as much. Keep your ankles below your toes when you kick your feet.
Take advantage of every rest position. Don't clutch the ice tools
hard, or else your fingers will get cold and lose strength. Walk
with your legs splayed out, like a cowboy, and you won't puncture
your expensive Gore-Tex bib overalls with crampons (one unfortunate
soul did just that later in the day).
</P>
<P>
   Eight hours after the class first met, we were climbing like
pros and begging for more.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night was the infamous pasta dinner, where dozens of
climbers still in their shells and fleece waited for the cooks to
come back from the store. ``It'll be 10 minutes,'' the man at the
door said, but after a half-hour it was apparent that wasn't true.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, the beer was locally brewed Kobor Wheat, and
only $1 per cup.
</P>
<P>
   An even bigger crowd showed up for the slide show by Barry
Blanchard, one of the world's most talented ice climbers. Blanchard
dazzled the crowd for 90 minutes with tales of death-defying
climbs.
</P>
<P>
   After the show, Blanchard said he was impressed by Adirondack
ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a couple really noteworthy ascents,'' he said. ``I'd
like to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, climbing does have its dangers. Take what happened to
one man we met the next day while back-country skiing to Avalanche
Lake. He joined us as we looked up the 500-foot cliffs, then
pointed to a popular and easy climb in a notch in the cliff called
the Trap Dike.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, our friend had been climbing unroped,
carrying skis strapped to his pack to ski the steep slides on the
far side. He was about 100 feet up when he slipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't believe how fast it happened,'' he recalled. ``It
was like someone tied a rope to my ankle and hooked it up to a John
Deere tractor.'' Before he knew it, he was bouncing and flailing
back down the ice-filled gully.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing I could do,'' he said. ``It happened in slow
motion. Ripped my pack to shreds, cracked my helmet.'' Amazingly,
he got snagged in some trees that broke his fall, along with some
ribs and his ankle. Rescuers carried him out and he recovered.
Several years later, he's back on skis and climbing again.
</P>
<P>
   These days, he uses a rope.

WHAT'S BEST BET FOR DAUGHTER'S IRA? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am considering helping my daughter to set up an IRA, both
with advice and with funding to the extent that I can. What are
your thoughts about conventional versus Roth IRAs for a 40-year-old
self-employed homeowner?
</P>
<P>
   G.O., Gearhart, Ore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There are two basic things to think about when contemplating
a Roth IRA versus a traditional account. One is the likely tax
bracket of the IRA's owner in retirement, and the second is the
period of time the money will be saved before retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The latter factor is easy enough to understand. With a Roth IRA,
the owner pays the taxes up front, contributing after-tax dollars
rather than taking the tax deduction which has long been one of the
most attractive features of traditional IRA. With the Roth, the
owner foregoes that deduction, but in compensation, all of the
money accumulated in the account can be withdrawn tax-free in
retirement. If it's a long investment time frame, the amount of the
investment earnings should dwarf the amount of the original
contribution. Suppose, for example, that your daughter opens a
$2,000 Roth IRA this year and leaves the funds invested until she
is aged 65. If she's in the 28 percent tax bracket, she will forego
the $560 tax deduction that she could have realized by using a
traditional IRA.
</P>
<P>
   But if she goes with the Roth account and the IRA money produces
average annual returns of 10 percent over the next 25 years, at
that point she will have amassed $21,668 in the account. Not only
can that money be withdrawn with no tax consequences, but there are
no strictures dictating mandatory withdrawal schedules after age 70
1/2 (as there are with traditional IRAs and other tax-deferred
saving programs). The only stricture on penalty-free withdrawals
from Roth accounts is that the owner must be past age 59 1/2 when
they are taken, and the funds withdrawn must have been in the
account for at least five years.
</P>
<P>
   Withdrawals can also be taken before age 59 1/2 without penalty
if the owner becomes disabled, or withdraws up to $10,000 to be
used for a first-time home purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Now, to get back to that first factor _ the owner's tax bracket.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly if the owner of an IRA is in a very low tax bracket, it
makes little sense to go with a traditional IRA. Since the tax
break is a deduction rather than a credit, a person who faces
little or nothing in the way of tax liability will get little or no
short-term benefit from a traditional IRA. A perfect example of a
person who would greatly profit from a Roth account would be a
teenager with a part-time job. Since the wages aren't likely to be
high enough to generate a significant tax liability, when this
person saves through a Roth IRA they sacrifice very little up front
and they get a whole lot in retirement. As an example, if a
17-year-old puts $1,000 in a Roth IRA that earns 10 percent
returns, that $1,000 would grow to $97,017 by the time the owner
reaches age 65 _ and all of it can be withdrawn tax free.
</P>
<P>
   But let's look at the other end of the spectrum. If a person is
relatively close to retirement age, is in a fairly high tax
bracket, and anticipates that he or she will be in a lower tax
bracket in retirement, a traditional IRA is the better choice.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take a person who is in the 31 percent tax bracket now,
who will retire in 10 years, and who will pay a 28 percent tax in
retirement. If this person put $2,000 in a traditional IRA and it
earns 10 percent average returns for 10 years, the account will be
worth $5,187.
</P>
<P>
   If it is then withdrawn and a 28 percent tax paid, the owner
will net $3,735. In contrast, if this person went with a Roth IRA,
investing $1,380 (after using $620 to pay the taxes due taxes now)
he or she would build a pool worth only $3,579 after a decade,
using the same assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   Two other factors should also be considered in weighing a Roth
IRA.
</P>
<P>
   First, if a person is uncertain of what their financial
situation will be in retirement but is optimistic that they will be
in a comfortable situation, the Roth IRA seems attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if people worry that tax rates in general will be higher
by the time they reach retirement age _ and certainly people in
their 40s and younger should consider that all this talk about the
possible crash of the Social Security system is well founded _ they
can buy themselves a nice insurance policy by going with a Roth.
</P>
<P>
   Now, one final factor when it comes to your daughter's
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Contributions to both Roth and traditional IRAs are limited to
$2,000, and the owner must earn at least as much as the
contribution. As a self-employed person, your daughter might open a
SEP-IRA or establish a Keogh plan _ both of which allow higher
levels of contributions than IRAs.
</P>
<P>
   When you consider that if your daughter made the maximum
contributions to either a traditional or Roth IRA until age 65 and
if the accounts earned 10 percent returns, she would have a total
of $204,920 in the account _ a sum which would produce a mighty
thin income stream right now, muchless after 25 years of inflation
has sapped its buying power.
</P>
<P>
   So the short lesson is that neither a Roth nor a traditional IRA
is likely to be enough for a 40-year-old who won't be able to count
on any other significant income stream in retirement. It's a nice
start, but she should be thinking of other plans as well.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 32 years old and have worked for almost two years,
earning about $29,000 a year. I put 15 percent of my salary in a
401(k) program invested in stock mutual funds, and also have
taxable accounts in AIM Constellation and AIM Balanced funds, with
a combined value of about $3,850; I add $100 a month to these
accounts. Finally, I have $10,000 in a CD and $4,000 in a savings
account. My goals are to get a used car and a house this year or
next. I would buy the house with my brother, dividing the costs. I
am also dreaming of having enough money to live in retirement. Can
I achieve these goals _ and how can I do it?
</P>
<P>
   P.L., San Diego &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think your idea of building a solid retirement pool
is a dream; if you continue to put 15 percent of your earnings in a
401(k) program or some other retirement plan _ raising the dollar
amount contributed every time you get a raise _ you should end up
in nice shape.
</P>
<P>
   But the other goals seem more problematical. While I don't know
a great deal about the San Diego real estate market, details in
letters from correspondents over the years lead me to believe that
both real estate prices and real estate taxes are substantial.
Let's suppose you considered the taxable mutual fund accounts and
your $10,000 CD money as being available for a real estate
purchase. Since you view a home purchase as a short-term goal, the
stock funds would be the wrong vehicle for saving _ stock funds are
simply too volatile for a short-term saving program. Better to
stick to CDs or money market funds. Now, if you continued to add
$100 a month to this pool, after two years, you would have about
$17,786, presuming 5 percent average returns from the accounts.
Then the next question is whether $35,572 (with your brother
matching your contribution) is enough for a down payment, and
whether you would could then be able to budget enough to pay your
share of the mortgage, taxes, insurance, and other costs of
home-ownership. My visceral sense is that you'd be cutting a very
thin line, if it can work at all. Better, I think, to consider this
a five-year savings program, at which time your savings would
amount to $24,459, and presumably your salary would have advanced
to a stage where the costs of home ownership won't seem as
oppressive as I imagine they would be now.
</P>
<P>
   As for the car, you're going to face the same kind of problems _
buying a car, even a very used car, is just a beginning. Then comes
insurance, registration costs, regular maintenance _ and you have
to be prepared for the prospect of significant repair bills. The
more used the car, the more significant the repairs are likely to
be. I know nothing of your living expenses, but my guess is that if
you analyze your situation carefully you'll find that you can view
the house and the car only as an either/or proposition. And if you
do get hung up on that debate, I'll give you my perspective: Houses
last longer.

   A. Sorry, but no can do. This question seems to come up with
some regularity, and as fond of money as I am, I must decline: I'm
a journalist and not a financial planner, and thus it would be
illegal for me to provide individual investment advice on a fee
basis.

TAKE PRECAUTIONS WITH FINANCES, ANALYSTS SAY  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES JAFFE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Year 2000 is Destination Unknown when it comes to money.
</P>
<P>
   And just as you might plan your finances if you were taking a
trip to another country, so too are consumers being warned to plan
out their finances for the Y2K trip.
</P>
<P>
   That means bringing along enough cash and the important
documents so that you can travel safely to your destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to be prepared, not panicky and doing things that you
later regret,'' says Paul M. Connolly, chief operating officer at
the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. ``You would not take all of
your money out of the bank to take it on vacation with you _ even
if you could not access it all for the time you were away _ and you
shouldn't be pulling everything out now to get ready for the Year
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Most observers believe the financial services industry is ahead
of the pack when it comes to Y2K readiness. The stock exchanges
have already done tests setting clocks ahead to the new millennium.
The mutual fund industry is working toward a test in March, at
which time most money management firms will find out which systems
they still need to patch up.
</P>
<P>
   And a story published this week in American Banker noted that
only 16 of the 10,415 banks and thrifts insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. were given an ``unsatisfactory'' mark from
regulators when it comes to Y2K readiness.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, most analysts believe your money is safe.
</P>
<P>
   The big question is whether you will be able to get at it.
</P>
<P>
   While banking and financial executives expect their systems to
be functioning, they acknowledge that troubles could arise in the
many systems that link the nation's financial network.
</P>
<P>
   Already, issuers of credit and debit cards have been warning
consumers that technology glitches caused by the Y2K problem could
mean that cards might not be accepted at all locations.
</P>
<P>
   But those computer glitches can happen today, not just in the
Year 2000. And typically, the card issuer wants such cases reported
so that it can then help the merchant whose technology is not
Y2K-compliant.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Bank plans to print more cash late in 1999,
largely to meet the expected demand.
</P>
<P>
   But having greenbacks to supplement the plastic is not the only
task at hand for consumers who want to steer clear of Y2K problems.
A host of ordinary financial tasks _ the kind of things consumers
routinely put off _ are worth doing this year . . . just in case.
</P>
<P>
   Those steps include:
</P>
<P>
   --Updating financial records.
</P>
<P>
   Have a paper listing of all investment accounts, credit cards,
and other financial obligations, including account numbers, payment
addresses, and amounts due or deposited. And make paper copies of
your last three tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   If your personal computer gets bitten, these records enable you
to make all payments on time and maintain your good name. If your
financial institution gets hit, they prove your account.
</P>
<P>
   --Getting a copy of your credit report.
</P>
<P>
   Many computerized companies report to credit agencies, and some
specialists believe this could be a big Y2K trouble spot. To avoid
problems, get a copy of your credit report now and clear up any
erroneous information. Then get another copy late in the year; this
version should not only be correct, but it will help you
reconstruct any problems that might be caused by the millennium
bug.
</P>
<P>
   --Getting a benefits statement from Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Many Y2K forecasters are worried about the government's computer
systems. Do a check-up on your most important government account by
getting a Personal Earnings and Benefit Estimate Statement, a
year-by-year breakdown of your wages and the Social Security taxes
paid into the program.
</P>
<P>
   --Consider spreading your money around.
</P>
<P>
   Because no one can be 100 percent certain that the new year will
arrive without problems, this might be a good time to consider
diversifying with whom you do business. It may not be necessary,
but it's certainly not bad medicine against a computer glitch
knocking one firm off-line.
</P>
<P>
   This, along with a little extra spending cash, should help you
maintain access to sufficient funds so that the Y2K adjustment
period is not a a bad trip.

AUTHOR'S SEARCH WAS A HARD JOURNEY BACK TO SLAVE DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was something that seemed necessary in his quest to confront
his family's past as slave holders in South Carolina, Edward Ball
thought, something he had to at least attempt. He would try to
track down and meet with some descendants of the slaves from the
various Ball plantations around Charleston, a personal attempt at
racial reconciliation that was opposed by many in his own family
and that filled him with fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a good idea to make some small gesture toward
the black families that our family had damaged,'' Ball said in an
interview. ``But I was afraid people would be angry, would refuse
to see me. I was afraid I would make people even more upset and I
might hurt them by bringing up painful memories. Worry was my
mind-set, and also fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Ball persisted, despite the doors that slammed in his face,
despite the New York black newspaper that castigated his plans. He
persisted because he also experienced moving moments that he will
never forget.
</P>
<P>
   They are the soul of Ball's remarkable ``Slaves in the Family''
(Ballantine, 453 pages, $15.95), which was the surprise winner of
the recent National Book Award for non-fiction.
</P>
<P>
   The award was such a surprise to the 40-year-old writer that,
moments before it was announced, he was perched on a men's room
sink scribbling possible acceptance remarks on a cocktail napkin _
until a stranger recognized him and he quit.
</P>
<P>
   There is still a certain shocked aura about Ball, a man of
Southern reserve and patrician bearing in a serious pin-striped
suit. The writer, who was educated at prestigious Brown University,
has not only seen his first book win the National Book Award. It
was also named ``the most overrated book of 1998'' by Salon
magazine, the Internet publication. These contradictory assessments
bring a bemused smile to Ball's face.
</P>
<P>
   He is far less sanguine about other criticism he has received,
particularly from those who prefer that slavery's horrors remain
buried in the past and those who think that his frank apologies to
two black families for his ancestors' sins amount to nothing more
than exercises in liberal guilt or even ``self-flagellation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand there is a lot of resentment out there,'' Ball
emphasized. ``I have given talks where people stand up and say this
slavery thing was settled 100 years ago, or people who say they
were born long after the Civil War, so what has this to do with me?
Comments like that remind about how many Germans say they had
nothing to do with Auschwitz and that was settled long ago, so why
make people upset about it now?
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand those comments because most of us don't want to
acknowledge that events of the past influence our daily lives
today. We like to think that we invented ourselves, that we are
masters of our own destinies, and that a background as white people
doesn't have anything to do with where we are professionally or
socially. But I truly think that my advantages as a white person
have catapulted me ahead of black people, in education, in jobs, in
housing. It is simply dishonest to say otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Ball's heartfelt words make him an easy target in this jaded era
when genuine emotion has been so undermined by politics and
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   But Ball _ who admits feeling ``not guilt, but accountability''
for what his ancestors did _ is not content with mere talk. He
shared some of his publisher's advance with the black families who
were kind enough to let him tell their stories. And he has now
pledged 25 percent of his earnings from ``Slaves in the Family'' to
establish a foundation to undertake some projects that will involve
both members of the Ball family and descendants of their slaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a reparations program,'' Ball said. ``That would
be impossible, I wouldn't know where to begin, even if there had
been a fortune handed down in our family from slave days, which
there is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are baby steps we are taking, involving a handful of
individuals, some black, some white, doing what is within their
power to reckon with a legacy we share.''
</P>
<P>
   That shared legacy, as uncovered by Ball's research,
contradicted Ball family legends of being benevolent owners of
their human property.
</P>
<P>
   Ball ancestors, who owned an estimated 4,000 slaves, turned out
to have run the largest U.S. company involved in the lucrative
African slave trade; to have ripped apart some slave families
forever; to have acceded to cruel punishments of slaves that
included whippings and amputations of limbs; to have engaged in
sexual relations between masters and slaves.
</P>
<P>
   That shared legacy, thanks to the voluminous records in the Ball
family, also allowed Ball to present descendants of his family's
slaves with the first information about some of their ancestors.
One of the lingering wounds of slavery has been that many African
Americans have had much of their family past erased.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why something remarkable often happened when Ball
shared the fruits of his research.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first few meetings with black families when it was
frightening for all of us, I could sense that we were communicating
and finding common ground,'' Ball emphasized. ``They were curious
and they wanted to know more _ and the more we talked about the
hard stuff, the more they wanted to know. I soon got clued in that
this was something that black people wanted to do, too.''
</P>
<P>
   So there may be no more powerful image from the pages of
``Slaves in the Family'' than that of a white man and a black man
walking across what once had been Limerick plantation.
</P>
<P>
   Ball had asked Thomas Martin, a retired school principal, if he
might want to visit the place where the writer had discovered his
grandfather had been born. Martin, who had never heard of the
place, readily agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The two men walked in silence across land that showed no trace
of its former use, except for the row of stately oaks leading to
where the plantation house once stood.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is hallowed ground,'' Martin said after a while. ``I feel
like I'm walking in the footsteps of Jesus.''

BIOGRAPHER PUTS MARTIN LUTHER KING ON CENTER STAGE OF HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REGINA HACKETT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thirty years after his murder, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr. has streets and schools named after him all over the country.
His birthday is a national holiday. Almost everybody knows his name
and acts respectful when it's mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   While that is entirely appropriate, the man himself is being
distorted in the process, contends writer Taylor Branch. ``King is
presented as a goody-goody,'' he said. ``His call to non-violence
is seen as nothing but a form of good manners. Just be nice.
Nothing could be further from the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Branch is now researching the third and final volume of his
history of the civil rights movement, whose overall title is
``America in the King Years.''
</P>
<P>
   The first book, ``Parting the Waters,'' won the 1988 Pulitzer
Prize for history and covered the years 1954 to 1963. The second,
``Pillar of Fire,'' published in 1998, covered 1963 to 1965. (Both
are now in paperback.) The third and final book, ``At Canaan's
Edge,'' will cover 1966 to 1968 and take Branch well into the next
century to complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally I planned to take three years and write one book,''
he said in an interview. ``I've spent 16 years and I'm still
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in his early 50s, Branch grew up in Alabama and retains in
his speech a bit of soft drawl. Although he did not participate in
the civil rights movement, the upheaval of it changed his life and
made him see the world and his place in it in a new way. Once he
got into journalism, he decided that period was the one he wanted
to explore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't satisfied with what had been written,'' he said.
``What was missing was the human stories. That's what I've tried to
provide. I'm not writing a King biography. A good biography gets
down to the heartbeat of its subject. That would be difficult for
me as a white person to accomplish. Instead I'm trying to present
King amid the thousands of people who gathered around him and
helped him make history.''
</P>
<P>
   In this, Branch is remarkably successful. The narrative that
extends over 1,500 pages in the first two books gathers thousands
of threads together without bogging down or losing its dramatic
edge. In the end, what Branch has described is nothing less than
one of the most decisive and important periods in American history,
with King at its center.
</P>
<P>
   Branch's cast includes such giants as Fanny Lou Hamer, Diane
Nash Bevel, James Bevel, Robert Moses, Julian Bond, Andrew Young,
Septima Clark, Medgar Evers, Stanley Levison, Bayard Rustin, Rabbi
Abraham Heschel and Malcolm X, with a wealth of new material on
Malcolm X's last days.
</P>
<P>
   There are an equal number of memorable, murderous heavies and
plenty of people who couldn't rouse themselves to do more than
deplore both sides. As King put it, ``Shallow understanding from
people of good will is more frustrating than absolute
misunderstanding from people of ill will.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the Rev. Jesse Jackson doesn't make an appearance
in either book. ``He's pissed about that,'' said Branch, smiling.
``He'll be in the third book.''
</P>
<P>
   Branch begins before King was born, exploring the significance
of the church for black Americans, not only as places of worship
but centers of community information, credit unions and even
people's courts. White bigotry was so common it wasn't notable even
to most white people of good will unless accompanied by violence.
</P>
<P>
   Will Rogers, who famously said he ``never met a man he didn't
like,'' was offended in the 1930s when the NAACP asked him not to
use the most derogatory racial slur for black people in his NBC
radio broadcast. He had opened the show by using it four times.
Eventually, he agreed to use the less offensive term of ``darky.''
</P>
<P>
   The integration of the armed forces after World War II set off a
firestorm in the South. Six black veterans were lynched in the
first week after their return. After that, black veterans rarely
wore their uniforms in public.
</P>
<P>
   Branch does a masterful job at bringing this period to life,
setting the stage for King and the movement he came to lead, not
only covering the well-known events such as the Little Rock school
integration crisis and Rosa Parks in the bus boycott, but giving
them vital context.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Eisenhower gets good press these days but not from
Branch, who ably shows him to be a racist by anybody's definition.
</P>
<P>
   John and Robert F. Kennedy are romantic figures to many
liberals, and yet they come off remarkably badly when responding to
King. They'd be stunned by Branch's title, ``America in the King
Years.'' They thought they were living in the Kennedy years.
</P>
<P>
   President Kennedy could never wrap his brain around the idea
that King was a major figure. Robert, as attorney general, got
bullied by J. Edgar Hoover into signing the order to wiretap King
and even at the end of his life hadn't managed to free himself of
Hoover's insane view of King. (Both Kennedys expressed the idea
that Hoover was out of his mind, Robert referring to him as a
psycho.)
</P>
<P>
   While King was in Sweden to accept the Nobel Peace Prize, Robert
wrote in his journal that he never had a conversation with King
about anything but communism and its effect on the civil rights
movement.
</P>
<P>
   That was Hoover's agenda, even though the FBI director knew the
American Communist Party had fallen from its membership heights in
the 1930s of roughly 80,000 to about 5,000 in the 1950s. So many of
those 5,000 were FBI informants, writes Branch, that Hoover toyed
with the idea of taking the party over, as he had the votes.
</P>
<P>
   And yet he relentlessly focused on his anti-Communist crusade,
seeing King as a public enemy and Communist dupe. Branch
graphically describes how the FBI hounded King. King was held in
such low repute by Hoover that he instructed his men not to warn
him if they heard of an assassination threat.
</P>
<P>
   Lyndon Baines Johnson was a different story. He had an
instinctive sympathy with civil rights and pushed hard to support
it, even though he understood he'd be losing the Southern states to
the Republican party for the foreseeable future. Two weeks into his
presidency, he warned his Senate mentor, Richard Russell of
Georgia, that ``if you get in my way'' on the civil rights bill,
``I'm going to run you down.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Branch said during the interview, Johnson's
inability to rise to the challenge of non-violence got him and the
country stuck in the Vietnam. ``He said repeatedly that he didn't
want to be in the war, but if he appeared to be chicken or yellow,
the people would desert him.'' Johnson turned on King when King
voiced strong criticism of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Branch thinks the Free Speech Movement and anti-war movements on
college campuses were at their hearts missed opportunities because
they failed to link with the more complex and sophisticated civil
rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They covered the civil rights movement the way Pat Boone
covered Little Richard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   King was a living witness to the power of the non-violent ideal,
and as such he's taken more seriously outside the United States
than in it, Branch said. ``John Hume in Ireland said King is his
greatest inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   Others who have said King helped shape their lives include
Vaclav Havel in the Czech Republic, Aung San Suu Kyi in Myanmar and
the leaders of the uprising at Tiananmen Square in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did Germans sing `We Shall Overcome' when the Berlin Wall
fell?'' asked Branch. ``That was in honor of King. Anyone who
thinks his impact is limited to black people hasn't begun to
understand him.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Pillar of Fire,'' Branch writes that ``King believed the
roots of democracy can be found not in French or Greek philosophers
but in the Hebrew prophets and their idea of equal souls. He
believed that humans could transcend enemy thinking. At stake was
nothing less than the capacity to lighten the stain of evil and
demonstrate the possibility of justice in the world's design, which
for King was the realization of God's presence. His moral intensity
in this regard struck President Kennedy as narrow and stifling.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides King, the major figure in ``Pillar of Fire'' is Malcom
X, with a wealth of new material about the turmoil of his life at
its end. Malcolm X never believed in non-violence or even in
democracy, but he had the honesty to admit his position of ``waste
your enemies'' was hollow, as Elijah Muhammad wouldn't let him or
anyone else defend Black Muslims who fell under physical attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire Malcolm X's honesty, and his ability to see his own
flaws and reinvent himself, not once but several times,'' said
Branch.
</P>
<P>
   In his history, Branch touches on the subject of King's
extramarital affairs, which came to light thanks to the FBI taps on
King's phones, hotel rooms and living quarters. ``King suffered
great guilt on this subject,'' said Branch. ``Anyone expecting a
human being to be perfect is not realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Branch pointed out that non-violence was ``the first idea from
the 1960s to be discarded, and yet it changed not only the country
but the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Branch said he finds it disheartening that supporters of
anti-affirmative action initiatives, including the recently passed
Proposition 200 in Washington state, claim King would have been on
their side.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're using King's language without his spirit,'' Branch
said. His eyebrows shot up when he recalled reading that Newt
Gingrich claims to have been part of the civil rights movement
because he was in the South as a volunteer for Barry Goldwater's
presidential campaign in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means Gingrich was completely opposed to the civil rights
movement,'' he said. ``Republicans got a foothold in the South in
1964 for the first time since the Civil War specifically because
they opposed civil rights. But the reporter didn't know his history
and let the claim stand unchallenged.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked in the interview who is providing moral leadership in the
country today, Branch paused. ``Clinton is the best president on
civil rights we've had since LBJ,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But moral leadership, being in the vanguard of positive social
change, doesn't come from presidents. It comes from the people. The
people have to lead their leaders. Not too many hopeful voices are
raised now, but Jesse Jackson has kept faith with the ideal of
non-violence. We need more people to understand the civil rights
era so they can carry the best of it on.''

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, Feb. 2:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-AIDS-NEWBORNS (Chicago) _ Researchers at an annual AIDS
meeting report results from a study in Africa showing that a
simple, short drug regimen produces striking reductions in
transmission rates of the AIDS virus from mothers to newborns. The
regimen involves giving relatively inexpensive drugs to the women
from several weeks before delivery, during labor and a week after.
Worldwide, 600,000 babies a year are born with HIV. By Lawrence K.
Altman. (1200 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-STARDUST (Undated) _ For decades, science has known of the
importance of star dust in the cosmic scheme of things, especially
in matter more elaborate than the simple elements made in the
primordial Big Bang. But scientists have never had pure samples to
study _ but soon will, if everything goes as planned. On Saturday,
NASA is to launch a probe meant to capture interplanetary and
interstellar dust in some of its rawest and purest forms, including
many thousands of grains from a comet. By William J. Broad. (1875
words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphics.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-KOOP-CRUSADES (Undated) _ At 82, Dr. C. Everett Koop remains
active working with a band of students at the institute that bears
his name. Foremost among their efforts: fighting the tobacco
industry. But Koop, the fiery surgeon general of the Reagan
administration, has other crusades as well. Among them: inadequate
medical education, obesity and vast gaps in the health care
network. By Holcomb B. Noble. (1980 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-NITROGEN-EXPLOSIVE (Undated) _ For a century chemists
doubted that such a substance could exist, but scientists at an Air
Force laboratory have created a freakish form of nitrogen believed
to be one of the most violently explosive substances ever made. By
Malcolm W. Browne. (800 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-COLORS-POISONS (Undated) _ Many of the world's most
astonishingly beautiful creatures _ from dazzling fluorescent frogs
to iridescently radiant butterflies _ are its most poisonous. Their
bodies laced with toxins, these animals find safety not in hiding
from their enemies but in drawing attention to themselves. They
adorn their foul-tasting flesh in a rainbow of easy-to-remember
warning colors, loudly reminding every predator who's had the
misfortune to taste one, never to try again. A new study suggests
that certain toxic species develop the colors only when they are
present in large enough numbers to make a difference. By Carol
Kaesuk Yoon. (1175 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-QUANTUM-ETHER (Undated) _ That ethereal stuff known as
``ether'' _ which even survived in the popular thought despite a
trashing by Einstein _ has become a universal field of ``quantum
fields.'' This stuff is hard to define, but it is what you have
when there is nothing else. Theorists spend a lot of effort
thinking about it. Recently new light has been shed on the subject.
An essay by Malcolm W. Browne. (1250 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MONEY-PSYCH (Undated) _ Psychological researchers have
amassed an impressive body of data suggesting that satisfaction
simply is not for sale. Not only does having more things prove to
be unfulfilling, but people for whom affluence is a priority in
life tend to experience an unusual degree of anxiety and depression
as well as a lower overall level of well-being. Likewise, those who
would like nothing more than to be famous or attractive do not fare
as well, psychologically speaking, as those who primarily want to
develop close relationships, become more self-aware, or contribute
to the community. By Alfie Kohn. (1300 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-YMCA-COMPETE (Undated) _ The battle between private health
clubs and nonprofit, tax-exempt centers like the YMCA now is
shifting to a courtroom with health clubs complaining they must
subsidize their competitors who save thousands a year in taxes. By
Liz Neporent. (800 words)
</P>

   VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ Shorts on health an fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ Contrary to previous reports, women who drink moderately _ up
to one and a half alcoholic drinks a day _ may face no increased
risk of developing breast cancer, according to a decades-long study
of 5,000 women in Framingham, Mass. In fact, the study by
researchers at Boston University School of Medicine suggests that
breast cancer risk may even decline slightly as alcohol consumption
rises from none to one and a half drinks a day. But other research
is contradictory. (365 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ A California study of the rapidly growing number of women
having children after the age of 40 showed that, like their younger
counterparts, almost all of the women had healthy babies. But
things were a lot more complicated along the way, especially for
first-timers. (400 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Apple-shaped children _ those with more fat around the
midsection _ have more heart disease risk factors than their
pear-shaped peers, according to a study reported yesterday. (280
words)
</P>
<P>
   BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column: More than
60 percent of Americans get little or no exercise, despite repeated
reminders about the myriad rewards of regular physical activity.
But now there's good news for the idle. Two studies show that
people don't have to exercise in the traditional sense _ as in
jogging, aerobics and cycling _ to glean many of the health
benefits of activity, including weight control. All you have to do
is incorporate more movement into your daily routines. By Jane E.
Brody. (1225 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-STROKE-RECOVERY (Undated) _ Doctors have found a bold new
way of helping people who have had strokes recover the ability to
talk and move their limbs in the first weeks and months after brain
injury. Patients are given low doses of the common stimulant
amphetamine along with intense physical therapy _ a combination
that appears to accelerate recovery in many people. By Sandra
Blakeslee. (1370 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DOSAGE-CHIP (Undated) _ Engineers from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology have built a prototype of a sophistical

preprogrammed schedule or by remote control. By John O'Neil.

<P>
   EVERETT, Mass. _ A former guard at a notorious Bosnian Serb
prison camp has settled with his family in Everett, stirring
intense debate among Bosnian refugees over whether he was an
accomplice to ``ethnic cleansing'' or in fact used his position to
help victims of the slaughter in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   No evidence has surfaced that Jezdimir Topic, 56, participated
in atrocities that occurred at Trnopolje, one of three camps around
the city of Prijedor in northwestern Bosnia where thousands of
Muslims and Croats were raped, tortured, and executed during
systematic efforts by the Serbs to drive them from the region in
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Topic's defenders acknowledge that he worked at the camp, armed
and in uniform. But they said he actually tried to help victims of
the Serbs and finally fled with his family because of the mass
killing.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that Topic had not disclosed his background as a
guard, the Immigration and Naturalization Service said after a
Globe inquiry that it would investigate his case.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Topic nor his family would be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Dragana Zubcevic, a family friend who escaped the Serb siege of
Sarajevo in 1992, said Topic and his family have been getting death
threats from other Bosnian refugees who, she said, have no evidence
but are looking for a villain.
</P>
<P>
   Zubcevic said Topic, whose wife is a Muslim, ran away from his
guard position after risking his life in attempts to save his
wife's family and other Muslim friends.
</P>
<P>
   However, three former prisoners at Trnopolje identified Topic as
a guard who offered no help to them, and they said they never saw
him help others. The former prisoners, each of whom had known Topic
for decades and confirmed his identity from a photo provided by the
Globe, said that rather than offering assistance, Topic refused
even to recognize them.
</P>
<P>
   Tesma Elezovic, 51, said she spotted Topic immediately in August
1992 when she and 30 other women were transferred to Trnopolje from
Omarska, another brutal camp run by the Serbs. She said Topic was
dressed in a Serb military uniform, carried an automatic rifle, and
was standing next to the camp commander, Slobodan Kurozovic, who
was later indicted on charges of committing atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked toward us and then he turned his back,'' said
Elezovic, who lives abroad but asked that her location not be
revealed. ``Then Slobodan told them to register us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jadranka Cigelj, an ethnic Croat who said she grew up on the
same street as Topic and has known him since she was 8, also said
Topic did nothing when he saw her, even though ``I looked like a
long stick with two eyes and some teeth at the top'' after losing
46 pounds in 54 days at Omarska. ``He pretended he didn't see me,''
she said bitterly during a telephone interview from Zagreb,
Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoners at Trnopolje slept outside or on a crowded
concrete floor in a converted elementary school. They ate
infrequently, they said, sometimes going days without meals while
under constant threat from Serb soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought he could just move away, move to Boston and come
away clean as a whistle,'' said Nusreta Sivac, 48, of Bosnia, who
also said she knew Topic long before the war. ``His attempt to run
away is not successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Farquharson, Boston district director of the INS, said
Topic's file contained no information indicating he had disclosed
his experience as a guard at Trnopolje before entering the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he did not divulge'' such associations to immigration
officers overseas ``it would be a very serious, major consideration
in revoking his refugee status and resulting in his removal from
the United States,'' Farquharson said. ``If all of this is
verified, this gentleman is going to face the serious prospect of
having his refugee status revoked.''
</P>
<P>
   Topic is at least the second Serb to turn up in the United
States whose actions in the war have been called into question.
Last year, Nikola Vukovic, a former Bosnian Serb soldier charged
with frequently beating Muslim and Croat prisoners with metal
pipes, bats, and other objects, was discovered living in suburban
Atlanta, working for a company that makes compressors for air
conditioners and refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   Four of Vukovic's alleged victims have sued him in US District
Court in Atlanta, accusing him of genocide, torture, and other
crimes against humanity. Vukovic has denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Roberts, counsel for the San Francisco-based Center for
Justice and Accountability, which helped file the suit, said the
group has received unconfirmed reports of other Serbs living in the
United States who may have been involved in human rights abuses.
Serbs accused of having a role in so-called ``ethnic cleansing''
operations also have surfaced in Canada, Germany, Switzerland, and
Australia as part of the mass exodus of refugees that followed the
war in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Topic and his wife, Muniba, who works for the International
Rescue Committee helping to resettle Bosnian refugees, live with
their two grown daughters in a neat, two-family house in Everett.
</P>
<P>
   Zubcevic, the family friend, said Topic's ``children shake every
time the telephone rings because callers say they will kill their
whole family. They question why his wife is working when he is a
murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like to talk about our past,'' Muniba Topic said in a
conversation on her front porch two weeks ago. ``Here we live, we
work, we enjoy it.''

GROUNDS FOR BACTERIA HYSTERIA UNDERLIE WIDENING RECALL OF MEATS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As more Americans trace illnesses to listeria-tainted processed
meats and more plants recall packaged products, health officials
worry openly about ``listeria hysteria.''
</P>
<P>
   But while some consumers are overreacting, feeling nauseous at
the sight of a hot dog, public health specialists say listeria
ho-hum would be far worse.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: This bacteria kills more than 20 percent of those it
strikes. Its serious victims are primarily pregnant women and
fetuses, the elderly, and those with a compromised immune system.
(Compare that to a death rate of less than 3 percent among those
who get food poisoning from salmonella and E. coli.)
</P>
<P>
   Every week, more sicknesses and deaths are being tied to a
particular strain of listeria found at a Michigan meat plant run by
Bil Mar, a subsidiary of the Sara Lee Corp. As of last week, 79
illnesses nationwide were linked to this Sara Lee plant, including
15 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Of that, five cases come from Massachusetts, including the death
of a fetus.
</P>
<P>
   And it's too early to know the full extent of listeria's recent
damage. Given its incubation period of anywhere from three to 70
days and an average incubation of three to four weeks, it could
still be some time before officials know the true extent of the
recent outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to consumer anxiety, the list of recalled products keeps
growing. In the past two weeks, Thorn Apple Valley and Oscar Mayer
announced listeria-related recalls. Together with Sara Lee's
recall, which was announced last month, the list includes such
brand names as Ball Park, Hygrade, Oscar Mayer, and Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   Deli managers are noticing customers' anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are asking lots of questions, such as what kind of
brands we sell,'' said Bobby DeDominicis, general manager of B &AMP; D
Deli in Brookline, Mass., which sells mostly the deli's own
prepared meats. ``I've noticed these questions more in the past
month.''
</P>
<P>
   But health officials say there's more information on listeria
that should settle some nerves. Most healthy people can ingest
listeria with no problem, perhaps just a mild stomach reaction.
</P>
<P>
   And while often fatal, the bacteria is relatively rare. About
1,800 serious listeria-related illnesses are reported nationwide
each year, said federal health officials. That compares to 40,000
cases nationwide of salmonella food poisoning, and 20,000 cases of
E. Coli-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   What is unusual about this year's outbreak is the ability of
health officials to identify a Michigan plant as the source. In
most years, listeria cases are logged in every state and the
sources are random. Last year in this state, there were 34
listeria-related deaths, with no one source identified.
</P>
<P>
   For now, public health officials are stepping up their warnings
about this bacteria for those with weak immune systems and women
who are pregnant. They are advising these groups to avoid eating
any kind of processed meats, as well as soft cheeses, such as brie,
in which listeria often hides.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a pregnant woman is healthy, health officials say she is
more prone to react strongly to listeria, and the bacteria can pass
to her fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials say they have long known that pregnant women
were vulnerable to listeria, but its rarity gave it low priority in
the list of warnings to this group.
</P>
<P>
   Until public health specialists understand the scope of the
problem, they urge the public to take precautions such as
re-cooking processed meats and cooking raw meat thoroughly. Because
this soil-based bacteria can also be found on vegetables, they urge
consumers to wash vegetables thoroughly before eating.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Kludt, epidemiology program coordinator for the
Massachusetts Department of Public Health, said people should also
practice general hygiene, washing their hands, knives, and cutting
boards after exposures to uncooked foods. Even watch the hygiene
practices of your local butcher or deli manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may be slicing meat on the same machine they used for the
Sara Lee meat,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
$1 mystery revealed
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that nothing is truly free, a Westwood, Mass. mother
grew understandably suspicious when she received a survey in the
mail with $1 in cold cash. It was clear the $1 was hers to keep,
whether she ultimately filled out the questionnaire or not.
</P>
<P>
   She worried that this was a guilt-inducing ploy to get her name
on a marketing list, which would trigger hundreds of annoying calls
and solicitations.
</P>
<P>
   The identity of the sender was vague. The survey, called the
``National Survey of Apparel Purchasing,'' asked questions about
how she chose and bought apparel. The questions included how many
children she had, her income, her educational background and
whether she took vacations outside the country.
</P>
<P>
   The three-sentence letter was from Frederick L. Barbour II,
president of The Barbour Group. A self-addressed return envelope
went to a place called ADE of Wisconsin in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was incredibly anonymous,'' she said. ``It raised my
antennae.''
</P>
<P>
   She asked us to check it out, and we did. After doing a
reverse-directory search of the address, we discover the ADE is
actually Accurate Data Entry, a company operated out of a basement
in Milwaukee. When we called, the receptionist said she knew about
the survey and promptly replied, ``Oh, it's for Lands' End.''
</P>
<P>
   So, we called Lands' End, the apparel mail-order business based
in Dodgeville, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Lands' End-sponsored survey,'' said Anna Schryver, a
company spokeswoman after checking with her marketing folks. ``It's
a blind survey. We don't want to bias the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed to make sense. But who is Frederick Barbour? Schryver
said he's an independent marketing consultant. We asked if he would
call us, just so we could ask about his $1 survey-completion
strategy. She said she'd leave a message for him, but couldn't give
us his number. We have yet to hear from him.

Infant carrier recall
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The US Consumer Product Safety Commission has announced the
recall of 240,000 ``Baby Bjorn'' infant carriers because infants
can fall out of the leg openings. Nine infants have slipped through
the openings, including six who suffered fractured skulls. The
carrier is made by Regal and Lager Inc. of Marietta, Ga.

NEW RULES GRANT A LIMITED TAXPAYER PRIVILEGE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA YIP 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You may have heard about new rules that shield your
conversations with your accountant.
</P>
<P>
   In a lot of ways, they sound like the attorney-client privilege,
which protects certain communications between a lawyer and client,
but they're not as broad.
</P>
<P>
   While the new Internal Revenue Service rules are similar, there
are lots of loopholes in the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   This complicated set of new rules, which gives a certain amount
of confidentiality to communications with nonattorneys over tax
advice, are part of the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998.
The rules only apply to communications after July 22, 1998. Any
communications made before that date aren't covered by the law.
</P>
<P>
   The privilege applies only to communications between taxpayers
and tax professionals authorized to practice before the IRS. That
includes certified public accountants, enrolled agents and enrolled
actuaries.
</P>
<P>
   While the privilege sounds attractive, it's filled with many
land mines:
</P>
<P>
   _You may assert the privilege only in civil tax matters before
the IRS and in any noncriminal tax case in federal court brought by
or against the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say you intentionally didn't report your income or
underreported your income or took deductions you weren't allowed to
take, and you knew you weren't allowed to take, in order to lower
your tax,'' said Rhett Buck, a certified public accountant and
attorney in Houston. ``That's criminal fraud and the information
concerning that wouldn't be privileged.''
</P>
<P>
   However, if you inadvertently failed to include income, that
would be civil fraud and that advice would be protected, said Buck,
chairman of the tax special projects committee of the Texas Society
of CPA's Houston chapter.
</P>
<P>
   _You may not claim the privilege over the actual preparation of
your tax return because the purpose of filing a return is to
disclose information to the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most taxpayers, talking to a CPA about your taxes and your
tax return is going to be protected,'' Buck said. ``What's not
protected is the actual providing of the information to prepare the
return. It's planning the return vs. actually preparing the
return.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the limitations, the confidentiality privilege is good
news for taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than what the taxpayer had before, which was no
privilege when they were talking to their accountant,'' said Larry
Campagna, a partner and tax attorney at Chamberlain, Hrdlicka,
White, Williams &AMP; Martin in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules are an added layer of protection. Although Texas
law says that accountants should keep confidential the information
they receive from their clients, that doesn't apply in federal tax
matters, Campagna said.
</P>
<P>
   But in order to maintain the new privilege, you must keep your
mouth shut about tax advice you get from your accountant or
enrolled agent.
</P>
<P>
   If you blab that information to your locker-room buddy or any
other third party, you've waived the privilege because that
information is supposed to be confidential between you and your
accountant.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you share the information with your spouse and
you're filing a joint tax return, you could claim the privilege,
Buck said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campagna's Rule No. 1 in dealing with the IRS is to keep
quiet,'' Campagna said. ``Speak only when spoken to and tell as
little as possible. Sometimes one word in the wrong situation can
be one word too many.''
</P>
<P>
   As with any new law, especially one dealing with taxes, lawyers
are still trying to figure out what's firmly defined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mess,'' said Steven Salch, tax partner at Fulbright &AMP;
Jaworski in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, can accountants or even lawyers within accounting
firms advise clients on the issue of whether the privilege applies
to them?
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the privilege provision will be in the Internal Revenue
Code, maybe it is considered to be tax advice, but advice about the
applicability of a privilege generally has been considered to be
legal advice beyond the purview of accounting work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The other thing is that the government would consider disclosure
of privileged information to another federal agency a waiver of the
privilege, Campagna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what if that disclosure were compelled by law?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the IRS is just starting to sort out the ambiguities in the
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are gray areas and there are exceptions, and at this
point, no one knows how this is going to be interpreted by the
courts,'' said an IRS official, who asked to remain anonymous.

PBS SERIES EXPOSES BLACK ARTISTS' DILEMMA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rondell Sheridan always felt he was getting the cold shoulder
from Russell Simmons, the self-made peddler of such culturally
aesthetic fare as the stand-up comedy series ``Def Comedy Jam.''
So, bumping into Simmons in New York City, he simply asked why, and
Simmons simply said: Sheridan wasn't ``revolutionary'' _ from
Simmons' vantage point, Sheridan's political, social and cultural
affinities didn't do much to aid the consciousness of black
liberation.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons was referring to Sheridan's comedy act.
</P>
<P>
   Seems ever since he'd stepped on stage more than a decade
earlier, Sheridan had found success in delivering a race-neutral
act to a collection of black and brown, but mostly white, faces.
His material wasn't born out of racism or deep-seated pain due to
poverty or oppression _ but of a well-adjusted, impeccably mannered
youngster educated in Catholic schools and reared within one of
Chicago's black, middle-class, middle-of-the-political-road
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't use skin color as a reference. Still, it's hardly a
good feeling knowing you aren't accepted because your artistic
ideology is perceived to be out of step with your own homeboys.
</P>
<P>
   Producers of the six-hour PBS series ``I'll Make Me a World: A
Century of African-American Arts,'' which began Monday and
continues Tuesday and Wednesday, had long envisioned it as a
catalyst for national discussion on black arts, and it's certainly
that. The documentary is the final project of the late Henry
Hampton, whose earlier work included the groundbreaking ``Eyes on
the Prize'' series.
</P>
<P>
   Even as it serves up the engaging personal tales of a selective
group of African-American artists _ noting their desires, ambitions
and struggles to create art that mirrors their lives _ it clearly
illustrates the ideological schisms that have long tainted the
achievements of black artists like Sheridan.
</P>
<P>
   Watching most of the six hours, I was reminded that before Alice
Walker's novel ``The Color Purple'' drew allegations that it
depicted only negative black male images, writer James Baldwin had
stirred the pot with a 1948 essay denouncing so-called protest
novels, such as Richard Wright's ``Native Son,'' for
``oversimplifying black life.''
</P>
<P>
   Black artists were tossed into conflicting camps: those like
Wright and activist and scholar W.E.B. Du Bois, who thought art
should advance the race; and those who felt it necessary to defend
the freedom of expression at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   So it appears that even then, the most accomplished black
artists couldn't escape the nagging notion that black art couldn't
simply be art, just as they couldn't walk away from the societal
debate over whether black people in America could simply be
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the thought prevailed that art must reflect a certain
political and racial consciousness or put forth positive images
while steering clear of the uncomfortable truths referred to, in
code, as dirty laundry.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly other American ethnic and religious groups have
similar concerns. But African-American artists actually start out
knowing that consumers demand that art not only inform and
entertain, but provide an uplifting experience with moral and
social responsibility. All too often, black artists end up being
judged not on artistic merit but whether the image criteria have
been met.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Rock learned this the hard way this past year, less
because of his outspoken criticism of black leaders and stars
(because Rock is an equal-opportunity offender, he usually escaped
prolonged criticism) than for a photo spread in Vanity Fair in
which he sported a minstrel black face, a painful reminder of
belittling cinematic atrocities. Rock's response: It's comedy; get
over it.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just it. Nothing is ``just'' ... when it deals with
race, and with nationalists and separationists and
multiculturalists and Afrocentrics and integrationists weighing in.
</P>
<P>
   The recent protests over two television series _ ``The Secret
Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer,'' a sitcom about a black butler during
the Lincoln administration, and ``The PJs,'' an animated comedy set
in a housing project _ zeroed in on the black producers and stars
affiliated with those shows and questioned their own
``self-hatred,'' prompting one black producer to relate the
atmosphere to 1950s McCarthyism.
</P>
<P>
   MORE .MDUL/.MDNM/
</P>
<P>
   Poet Saul Williams, one of the many artists featured on the PBS
series, prefers to call it a ``consciousness shift'' in the right
direction. ``People are more aware,'' he says during an interview.
``More sensitive in terms of what's happening. They're asking,
`What are we listening to? What are we watching? What are we
seeing?' ''
</P>
<P>
   But one must wonder what kind of chilling effect it all has on
free expression and whether black artists are falling short of
exposing certain truths, particularly when the truth hurts.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Michael Howard, one of the actors supplying voice to ``The
PJs,'' says any artist allowing ideology to dictate what they say
or do is ``endangering quality.'' He says it's unfortunate that a
performer can't just make a creative expression and let it be what
it is.
</P>
<P>
   His comments got me to thinking about comedian Steve Harvey,
who, when we met a number of years ago, was doing two completely
different stand-up acts _ one for black audiences, another for
whites. (Television fame has enabled him to consolidate acts.)
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprising that Spike Lee, applauded for his ``militant
filmmaking'' in ``Do the Right Thing'' and criticized for airing
dirty laundry in ``School Daze'' (dealing with the long-simmering
skin color debate among blacks), feels the tug from all sides.
</P>
<P>
   Says Lee, ``I've always felt that you have to try to get to the
truth, and let the chips fall where they may.''
</P>
<P>
   But now Lee is becoming part of the elder generation he used to
mistrust, and a new vanguard is emerging. These younger artists
have had better opportunities in education and employment, and have
experienced fewer instances of the type of blatant racism suffered
by their parents and grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder artists in their 20s seem to talk of ``transcending''
the barriers of ``blackness,'' which is, of course, ludicrous. What
the young artists are saying, unfortunately, is that they want to
appeal to as many people as possible to get as much as possible,
which is, if anything, the strong pull of our current material
world.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder if the emerging black aesthetic will be grounded even
less in the premise of race as a source of conflict than the notion
that black artists have a right to choose from all that America
offers. Writer John Edgar Wideman made this point in the second
hour Monday, saying that the whole purpose of writing is to get
outside one's own skin.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one could count me among the confused, as my hope is
that black art remains a way to heighten consciousness while
respecting others' pain. Yet if the next century of
African-American art becomes synonymous with what could be viewed
as ideological propaganda, I want no part of it.

   When a reporter came to the side door recently after Topic was
observed on the street, the younger of his two grown daughters,
Arijana, answered. She said her father does not speak English and,
in any case, ``we don't want to discuss'' his role in the camp.
</P>
<P>
   Topic has been in Massachusetts since at least 1995, when he
obtained a driver's license. His presence in the Boston area
continues to be a matter of deep dispute within the 1,100-member
Bosnian refugee community in Massachusetts, among refugees
elsewhere, and among officials and advocates concerned with
immigration and human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
   The camps at Trnopolje, Omarska, and Keraterm symbolized some of
the gravest abuses of a war that enveloped thousands of innocents
in its inhumanity and gore. According to indictments issued by the
International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the
camps were established for the specific purpose of killing Muslims
and Croats, or so frightening and abusing them that they would flee
the area around Prijedor. The Trnopolje camp was the largest of the
three, and was the one to which most women, children, and elderly
people were taken and confined with minimal shelter and inadequate
sanitation and food.
</P>
<P>
   Trnopolje ``served as the staging point for the mass deportation
of all those who survived the initial attacks and camp regime,''
tribunal investigators found in a genocide indictment issued
against a Serb leader in 1997. ``It also served a much more
sinister purpose: the sexual assault, rape, and torture of many of
the women detained there by camp personnel. . . . In many instances
the women and girls were taken from the camp and raped, tortured,
or sexually abused at other locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition, many prisoners both male and female were killed,
beaten, and otherwise physically and psychologically maltreated by
the camp personnel and other Serbs. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   One survivor of Trnopolje, who was in the camp from May to July
1992 and asked not to be identified, said 20 to 30 uniformed Serbs
normally were stationed there to control about 3,000 detainees. She
said that made it impossible for guards to be unaware of the
outrages that were being committed.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions were relatively better at Trnopolje than they had
been at Omarska, said Cigelj, who spent five days at Trnopolje in
August 1992. ``Trnopolje was a four-star hotel compared to Omarska,
even though people were constantly beaten,'' she said. ``Life was
worth nothing in either camp, absolutely nothing, but in terms of
gradations of horror, Omarska was worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Elezovic said that even though she lost 77 pounds at Omarska,
the Serbs gave her just one meal _ a watery soup flecked with meat
_ after she arrived at Trnopolje. She spent the rest of her stay
eating bread and a few pieces of macaroni given to her by other
prisoners who acquired the food when relatives were allowed to
bring it to them.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about Topic initially were raised within the refugee
community about two years ago. Rita Kantarowski, director of the
office, said after the IRC became aware of the Topic issue ``we
followed it up with the community'' by holding a meeting at the
agency's office. The concerns raised ``did not have anything to do
with the person who works here,'' Muniba Topic, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kantarowski said some people at the community meeting said Topic
did help detainees in the camp, but she was unable to say whether
anyone who was not a family member gave such testimony. ``I am
satisfied with the research I have done . . . that there is no
basis'' for disputing his refugee status, Kantarowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Zubcevic said Topic told her that he would have gone ``crazy''
if he had remained at the camp, and fled because of the killing he
witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very good person,'' Zubcevic said. ``He cried once
when he explained how the Serbian army had killed women and kids.''
</P>
<P>
   But camp survivors and other critics said Topic is now making
excuses for his complicity in killings at the camp. They said that
Topic, then in his late 40s, was under no obligation to join the
military and they asserted he must have been fully aware of the
Serbs' grisly tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who are responsible because they committed
war crimes and there are those who are responsible because they did
nothing to prevent them,'' Cigelj said, adding that she believes
Topic was in the latter group. ``All those people who put on a
uniform are responsible for letting this type of political program
surface and flourish.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Zakim, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League,
said it is important to learn the truth about Topic because
``identification and eventual prosecution sends a message to the
people who are there now that `you will be held accountable.' I
hope that would send a shiver down the spines of people who are
there committing atrocities today.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always have a ready excuse that they had no choice, or
that they tried to help,'' Zakim said. ``It's the oldest one in the
book. People who perpetuate atrocitiesz. . . often depend on the
apathy or silence of people who consider themselves mere
bystanders.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Cigelj said, some soldiers did help some prisoners, but
she said she never saw Topic do that.
</P>
<P>
   Sivac said that even soldiers who tortured prisoners were known
occasionally to perform acts of kindness. She said the deputy
commander at Omarska, who since has been indicted, once brought her
a small package of cigarettes and toiletries. ``That helped me,''
she said, ``but he was responsible for the death and torture of
hundreds of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Cigelj, a lawyer and political activist, said Topic's inaction
seemed worse considering she had known him most of her life. She
described Topic as a friendly, unassuming, slightly arrogant man
who went by his childhood nickname, Giga. He and his wife were
elementary school teachers before the war, she said, adding that
during their childhood, her family shared a home with the family of
Topic's best friend, so she saw Topic often.
</P>
<P>
   After identifying Topic through his photo last week, she said,
``I couldn't believe I would see the day when someone would send me
a photo of Giga and I would have to confirm that he was a person
who participated in something like this, where other people were
hurt. It's very difficult to face something that was part of your
childhood and then see it in this light.''

<P>
   EVERETT, Mass. _ A former guard at a notorious Bosnian Serb
prison camp has settled with his family in Everett, stirring
intense debate among Bosnian refugees over whether he was an
accomplice to ``ethnic cleansing'' or in fact used his position to
help victims of the slaughter in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   No evidence has surfaced that Jezdimir Topic, 56, participated
in atrocities that occurred at Trnopolje, one of three camps around
the city of Prijedor in northwestern Bosnia where thousands of
Muslims and Croats were raped, tortured, and executed during
systematic efforts by the Serbs to drive them from the region in
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Topic's defenders acknowledge that he worked at the camp, armed
and in uniform. But they said he actually tried to help victims of
the Serbs and finally fled with his family because of the mass
killing.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that Topic had not disclosed his background as a
guard, the Immigration and Naturalization Service said after a
Globe inquiry that it would investigate his case.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Topic nor his family would be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Dragana Zubcevic, a family friend who escaped the Serb siege of
Sarajevo in 1992, said Topic and his family have been getting death
threats from other Bosnian refugees who, she said, have no evidence
but are looking for a villain.
</P>
<P>
   Zubcevic said Topic, whose wife is a Muslim, ran away from his
guard position after risking his life in attempts to save his
wife's family and other Muslim friends.
</P>
<P>
   However, three former prisoners at Trnopolje identified Topic as
a guard who offered no help to them, and they said they never saw
him help others. The former prisoners, each of whom had known Topic
for decades and confirmed his identity from a photo provided by the
Globe, said that rather than offering assistance, Topic refused
even to recognize them.
</P>
<P>
   Tesma Elezovic, 51, said she spotted Topic immediately in August
1992 when she and 30 other women were transferred to Trnopolje from
Omarska, another brutal camp run by the Serbs. She said Topic was
dressed in a Serb military uniform, carried an automatic rifle, and
was standing next to the camp commander, Slobodan Kurozovic, who
was later indicted on charges of committing atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked toward us and then he turned his back,'' said
Elezovic, who lives abroad but asked that her location not be
revealed. ``Then Slobodan told them to register us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jadranka Cigelj, an ethnic Croat who said she grew up on the
same street as Topic and has known him since she was 8, also said
Topic did nothing when he saw her, even though ``I looked like a
long stick with two eyes and some teeth at the top'' after losing
46 pounds in 54 days at Omarska. ``He pretended he didn't see me,''
she said bitterly during a telephone interview from Zagreb,
Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoners at Trnopolje slept outside or on a crowded
concrete floor in a converted elementary school. They ate
infrequently, they said, sometimes going days without meals while
under constant threat from Serb soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought he could just move away, move to Boston and come
away clean as a whistle,'' said Nusreta Sivac, 48, of Bosnia, who
also said she knew Topic long before the war. ``His attempt to run
away is not successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Farquharson, Boston district director of the INS, said
Topic's file contained no information indicating he had disclosed
his experience as a guard at Trnopolje before entering the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he did not divulge'' such associations to immigration
officers overseas ``it would be a very serious, major consideration
in revoking his refugee status and resulting in his removal from
the United States,'' Farquharson said. ``If all of this is
verified, this gentleman is going to face the serious prospect of
having his refugee status revoked.''
</P>
<P>
   Topic is at least the second Serb to turn up in the United
States whose actions in the war have been called into question.
Last year, Nikola Vukovic, a former Bosnian Serb soldier charged
with frequently beating Muslim and Croat prisoners with metal
pipes, bats, and other objects, was discovered living in suburban
Atlanta, working for a company that makes compressors for air
conditioners and refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   Four of Vukovic's alleged victims have sued him in US District
Court in Atlanta, accusing him of genocide, torture, and other
crimes against humanity. Vukovic has denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Roberts, counsel for the San Francisco-based Center for
Justice and Accountability, which helped file the suit, said the
group has received unconfirmed reports of other Serbs living in the
United States who may have been involved in human rights abuses.
Serbs accused of having a role in so-called ``ethnic cleansing''
operations also have surfaced in Canada, Germany, Switzerland, and
Australia as part of the mass exodus of refugees that followed the
war in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Topic and his wife, Muniba, who works for the International
Rescue Committee helping to resettle Bosnian refugees, live with
their two grown daughters in a neat, two-family house in Everett.
</P>
<P>
   Zubcevic, the family friend, said Topic's ``children shake every
time the telephone rings because callers say they will kill their
whole family. They question why his wife is working when he is a
murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like to talk about our past,'' Muniba Topic said in a
conversation on her front porch two weeks ago. ``Here we live, we
work, we enjoy it.''

ENSURE THE PROGRAM THAT HELPS ENSURE OUR PROSPERITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Save Social Security first! That was the most commanding
challenge in President Clinton's State of the Union message. He
laid down the gauntlet for action this year.
</P>
<P>
   The way Congress responds to this call will be more important to
the American people than how the Senate wraps up the out-of-steam
impeachment imbroglio or how the legislative branch handles any
other recommendation in Clinton's hourlong address.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter what you think of Clinton personally. Love
him, hate him, admire or merely tolerate him _ Social Security is
larger than any politician's fate and bigger than either party's
pride.
</P>
<P>
   Americans may not know or really care much how their
congressional representative votes on a myriad of issues, including
some consequential ones.
</P>
<P>
   But the people are watching what Congress does this year with
Social Security. Lawmakers, be sure of that.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who remembers America before Social Security should know
how important it has been and is. It was the New Deal's most
significant and pervasive social innovation. Today it is the most
stabilizing institution of American society.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other single facet of 20th-century life, Social
Security has immunized this country from recurring economic
depressions. It has broadened the base of our American marketplace.
Banished the specter of the poorhouse. Cushioned the financial
problems, haunting fears and psychic agonies of aging. Freed
children from the economic strain of caring for dependent parents.
And, for countless millions, enriched life's twilight years with
dignity and self-respect.
</P>
<P>
   A fortunate few could complain egotistically that they've put
more into the fund than they'll ever personally draw out. But we of
whom that's true are among the program's most fortunate
beneficiaries. We have ridden the prosperity wave that it set in
motion.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, but we'd have done better individually, some argue, to have
put all those contributions into Coca-Cola stock. Be honest. How
many of us would have done that? How many of us did?
</P>
<P>
   And the question we pass over so glibly: Exactly how reliable
was the stock market before we had Social Security? In 1929, its
value shrank 40 percent in three months. Where would the Dow Jones,
that giddy reflection of our economic health, be today had it not
been for the steady discipline of Social Security's national
retirement savings plan that undergirds that economy?
</P>
<P>
   For years we've taken Social Security for granted. We've
borrowed from it to fight wars, build weapons and finance other
needs that we didn't want to pay for at the time. For 60 years its
trust fund reflected a healthy surplus. Policy-makers have drawn
from it _ sometimes to cut taxes and mask willful deficits. Now
it's payback time.
</P>
<P>
   If we want our grandchildren to enjoy Social Security's
blessings, as the four or five generations before them have done,
we'll make the task of reinforcing its declining balance our No. 1
priority. We'll do that first, before somebody fritters away or
divides up our immediate good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, we're like a family that has fallen heir to
unexpected wealth. We can invest it in blue chips and make sure our
children, and theirs, are never in need. Or we can cash it in, quit
work and take the family to Las Vegas while it lasts.
</P>
<P>
   Today, because of fortuitous planning or providential blessing,
we have a budgetary surplus for the first time in 30 years. At our
present rate of economic growth, the projected pattern of federal
revenues and expenditures, if continued, will yield foreseeable
surpluses reaching into the trillions during the first quarter of
the coming century.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants us to commit about 62 percent of those surpluses
over the next 15 years to building up an adequate reserve fund for
Social Security. He would have a board of independent experts
invest approximately one-fourth of that money in the stock market
on our behalf, hoping to increase its value. The remainder would be
invested, as at present, in U.S. Treasury bonds. They yield less
annual return than many stocks but are the safest investments on
earth.
</P>
<P>
   Nodding to Republican suggestions in a bid for bipartisan
cooperation, Clinton would approve letting about 1 percent of the
surplus support voluntary individual retirement accounts, giving
workers a supplementary source of old age income. Each would get an
annual lump sum to invest, with matching contributions from the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Some objections are heard to various phases of this plan. If
lawmakers don't like it, they should try to improve on it, not just
criticize and obstruct it. The president's outline amounts to
openers in the most important game that Congress can play this year
for the American people and our economy's future.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made a similar, though less specific, proposal last
year. This time he has fleshed it out. It is bold. It is concrete.
It isn't perfect. But it's far better than no plan at all. Congress
wasted last year and did nothing. It has already lost the first
month of 1999 _ the Senate debating impeachment charges, the House
in what amounts to a monthlong recess.
</P>
<P>
   Most folks are keenly aware of the problem looming ahead for our
Social Security trust fund as baby boomers reach retirement. People
are weary with inaction and fed up with diversions. If Congress
doesn't like the president's plan, for whatever reason, then let's
see a better one.
</P>
<P>
   The American people expect action this year _ thoughtful,
decisive action. They deserve no less.
</P>

   (NYT21) MIAMI -- Jan. 31, 1999 -- FBN-SUPER-BOWL-7, 1-31 -- The
Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway, a unanimous choice for MVP
of Super Bowl XXXIII, in which the Broncos defeated the Atlanta
Falcons 34-19, enjoying a second straight Broncos' Super Bowl
victory. Elway, right, congratulates his workhorse running back
Terrell Davis, the league MVP, on another incredible season. The
38-year-old Elway hedged on whether he would retire or come back to
try to make the Broncos the first team to win three straight Super
Bowls. (Jose R. Lopez/New York Times Photo)

<P>
   (NYT20) MIAMI -- Jan. 31, 1999 -- FBN-SUPER-BOWL-6, 1-31 -- The
Atlanta Falcons and their head coach Dan Reeves watch time fly away
along with their chances for a Super Bowl victory Sunday. Reeves'
old team, the Denver Broncos, defeated the Falcons 34-19 in Super
Bowl XXXIII. The Broncos beat an Atlanta team that was its own
worst enemy, and Elway got a measure of revenge on Reeves, who
coached him in three Super Bowl losses and left Denver in 1992 at
odds with the quarterback. (Jose R. Lopez/New York Times Photo)

<P>
   (NYT19) MIAMI -- Jan. 31, 1999 -- FBN-SUPER-BOWL-5, 1-31 -- The
Denver Broncos linebacker Bill Romanowski enjoying a moment of
glory after the Broncos defeated the Altanta Falcons 34-19 in Super
Bowl XXXIII Sunday. Super Bowl XXXIII swung on defensive stands by
the Denver Broncos and missed chances by the Atlanta Falcons.
``That's what you've got to do -- you've got to keep them from
scoring touchdowns,'' said Romanowski. ``We preach that, and we
live it.'' (Jose R. Lopez/New York Times Photo)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT18) MIAMI -- Jan. 31, 1999 -- FBN-SUPER-BOWL-4, 1-31 -- The
Denver Broncos 38-year-old quarterback John Elway scoring a
touchdown in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl XXXIII Sunday, in
which the Broncos defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34-19. Elway, who
was the unanimous choice for MVP, completed 18 of 29 passes for 336
yards and one touchdown and ran 3 yards for another score. The
total yardage was third best in Super Bowl history. (Jose R.
Lopez/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT17) SHELTON, Conn. -- Jan. 31, 1999 -- INTERNET-SMUT-TRIAL,
1-31 -- Mitchell S. Tepper, head of the Sexual Health Network,
opposes a new federal law meant to shield children from commercial
pornography on the World Wide Web. Critics of the law say that if
it goes into effect, it could force a variety of Web site operators
to choose between self-censorship or prison. Backers say the law is
necessary to prevent commercial sites from making graphic sexual
images available to all visitors, including children. (Thomas

   (NYT16) NEW YORK -- Jan. 31, 1999 -- INTERNET-MUSIC-SALES, 1-31

the Internet using software from A2B Music. A2B's Howard Singer, at
the keyboard, says the potential customer base is growing, but he
frets that people may get used to free music. (James Estrin/New

   (NYT15) ARMENIA, Colombia -- Jan. 31, 1999 -- COLOMBIA-QUAKE-3,
1-31 -- People setting up temporary makeshift huts in the city of
Armenia after their houses were destroyed by the earthquake that
measured 6.0 on the Richter scale, and was the worst to hit the
area in more than 100 years. About 35,000 families, or 180,000
people, have been left homeless, and over 1000 people were killed,
the Colombian Red Cross has announced. (Chang W. Lee/New York Times

food to people in need after the earthquake which measured 6.0 on
the Richter scale, and the worst to hit the area in more than 100
years, struck the city of Armenia. About 35,000 families, or
180,000 people, have been left homeless, and over 1000 people were
killed, the Colombian Red Cross has announced. (Chang W. Lee/New
York Times Photo)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT13) ARMENIA, Colombia -- Jan. 31, 1999 -- COLOMBIA-QUAKE-1,
1-31 -- Isabel Cristina Marquez, a 28-year-old waitress from
Elmhurst, N.Y., and her husband Farid Losso, 29, who still lives in
Colombia, in front of the house where the family used to live
before it was destroyed by the earthquake that rocked the city of
Armenia. Like many of the tens of thousands of Colombian immigrants
who live in the New York region, Ms. Marquez leads a split life.
She lives here and there, dividing her time evenly between two
countries. ``We've lost our home here in Colombia,'' she says.

   (NYT9) PHOENIX -- Jan. 31, 1999 -- ARIZ-HOSPITAL, 1-31 -- A
patient watching television at the civil rehabilitation ward at the
Arizona State Hospital for mental health care. The hospital's
113-year history has been checkered with pride and pain, but the
last few years have been some of the hardest for the hospital.
Budget cuts and staff reductions have left ASH scrambling to find
enough nurses and technicians to care for those who have been sent
here by civil and criminal courts across the state. Treatment has
suffered, and morale and pay are low. (Monica Almeida/New York

<P>
   (NYT8) UNDATED -- Jan. 31, 1999 -- CALIF-NEWSPAPERS-MEDIA, 1-31
-- In a little more than two years, William Dean Singleton has
become the No. 2 newspaper publisher in Southern California, buying
up a string of small dailies in a pincer-like move around the
dominant paper, The Los Angeles Times. Some say the expansion may
hinder The Los Angeles Times, which is owned by the Times Mirror
Co., from pursuing growth in the suburbs. (Brian Brainerd/New York

</P>
<P>
   (NYT7) NEW YORK -- Jan. 31, 1999 -- NATIONAL-GEOGRAPHIC-MEDIA,
1-31 -- National Geographic is starting to use newsstands in order
to revive its fortunes and halt a steadily declining circulation.
It is the first time in the Geographic's 111-year history that it
has resorted to use of newsstands, which it has long scoffed at as
downscale but now sees as the means for attracting the diverse and
younger readers it so desperately needs. (Ruby Washington/New York

   (NYT6) WASHINGTON -- Jan. 31, 1999 --
INTERNET-LOBBYISTS-PROFILE, 1-31 -- Marc Rotenberg, from left, Dave
Banisar and David L. Sobel of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center oppose plans to include identification features in a
computer chip. Privacy advocates say the feature, intended to
enhance the security of electronic commerce and safeguard against
software piracy, would make it easy for online marketers, even
governments, to track people on the Internet. (Marty Katz/New York

<P>
   (NYT5) MARRAKESH, Morocco -- Jan. 31, 1999 --
MOROCCO-SINGLEMOMS-2, 1-31 -- A woman and a child in the streets of
Marrakesh, Morocco. In general, women are treated as inferior under
Morocco's Koranic laws: they are legal minors, inherit only half a
share, need permission from a male relative to marry and can be
repudiated by their husbands. But a woman who has a child out of
wedlock is treated with even more disdain. (Marlise Simons/New York
Times Photo)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT4) AGADIR, Morocco -- Jan. 31, 1999 -- MOROCCO-SINGLEMOMS-1,
1-31 -- Young women and a baby they are looking after in a day care
center run by a Swiss foundation in Agadir, Morocco. In a country
where abortion is forbidden by law and a woman who has a child out
of wedlock is treated with even more disdain, the center is an
important service for unmarried mothers, who become social
outcasts, even rejected by their families. (Marlise Simons/New York
Times Photo)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT3) NEW YORK -- Jan. 31, 1999 -- BLUE-THEATER-REVIEW, 1-31 --
From left, June Watson, Pearce Quigley and Mary Macleod in Caryl
Churchill's production of ``Blue Heart,'' at the Majestic Theater
of the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Directed and acted with a finesse
and wit that are far more warm than chilly, the production feels
like a love poem to the endless possibilities of theater, even as
it exposes its limitations. (Andrea Mohin/New York Times Photo)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT2) NEW YORK -- Jan. 31, 1999 -- DANCE-GISELLE-REVIEW, 1-31
-- The Eifman Ballet of St. Petersburg performing ``Red Giselle''
at City Center. Boris Eifman's choreographic essay on the life and
mental illness of the Russian emigre ballerina Olga Spessivtseva is
expressed in a style with cartoonlike simplicities. One can contest
the ballet's picture of good and evil. But one also has to admire
the impact of Eifman's choreography and the sheer originality of
his theatrical vision. (Ruby Washington/New York Times Photo)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT1) BOSTON -- Jan. 31, 1999 -- U.S.-MUSEUMS-MOBS, 1-31 -- The
most popular exhibition in the United States last year, ``Monet in
the 20th Century,'' at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, which
counted 565,992 visitors during a three-month run that ended on
Dec. 27. Population differences notwithstanding, nearly everyone
credits the current success of American museums to marketing. (Evan

<P>
   SCI-AIDS-NEWBORNS (Chicago) _ Researchers at an annual AIDS
meeting report results from a study in Africa showing that a
simple, short drug regimen produces striking reductions in
transmission rates of the AIDS virus from mothers to newborns. The
regimen involves giving relatively inexpensive drugs to the women
from several weeks before delivery, during labor and a week after.
Worldwide, 600,000 babies a year are born with HIV. By Lawrence K.
Altman. (1200 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-STARDUST (Undated) _ For decades, science has known of the
importance of star dust in the cosmic scheme of things, especially
in matter more elaborate than the simple elements made in the
primordial Big Bang. But scientists have never had pure samples to
study _ but soon will, if everything goes as planned. On Saturday,
NASA is to launch a probe meant to capture interplanetary and
interstellar dust in some of its rawest and purest forms, including
many thousands of grains from a comet. By William J. Broad. (1875
words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphics.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-KOOP-CRUSADES (Undated) _ At 82, Dr. C. Everett Koop remains
active working with a band of students at the institute that bears
his name. Foremost among their efforts: fighting the tobacco
industry. But Koop, the fiery surgeon general of the Reagan
administration, has other crusades as well. Among them: inadequate
medical education, obesity and vast gaps in the health care
network. By Holcomb B. Noble. (1980 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-NITROGEN-EXPLOSIVE (Undated) _ For a century chemists
doubted that such a substance could exist, but scientists at an Air
Force laboratory have created a freakish form of nitrogen believed
to be one of the most violently explosive substances ever made. By
Malcolm W. Browne. (800 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-COLORS-POISONS (Undated) _ Many of the world's most
astonishingly beautiful creatures _ from dazzling fluorescent frogs
to iridescently radiant butterflies _ are its most poisonous. Their
bodies laced with toxins, these animals find safety not in hiding
from their enemies but in drawing attention to themselves. They
adorn their foul-tasting flesh in a rainbow of easy-to-remember
warning colors, loudly reminding every predator who's had the
misfortune to taste one, never to try again. A new study suggests
that certain toxic species develop the colors only when they are
present in large enough numbers to make a difference. By Carol
Kaesuk Yoon. (1175 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-QUANTUM-ETHER (Undated) _ That ethereal stuff known as
``ether'' _ which even survived in the popular thought despite a
trashing by Einstein _ has become a universal field of ``quantum
fields.'' This stuff is hard to define, but it is what you have
when there is nothing else. Theorists spend a lot of effort
thinking about it. Recently new light has been shed on the subject.
An essay by Malcolm W. Browne. (1250 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MONEY-PSYCH (Undated) _ Psychological researchers have
amassed an impressive body of data suggesting that satisfaction
simply is not for sale. Not only does having more things prove to
be unfulfilling, but people for whom affluence is a priority in
life tend to experience an unusual degree of anxiety and depression
as well as a lower overall level of well-being. Likewise, those who
would like nothing more than to be famous or attractive do not fare
as well, psychologically speaking, as those who primarily want to
develop close relationships, become more self-aware, or contribute
to the community. By Alfie Kohn. (1300 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-YMCA-COMPETE (Undated) _ The battle between private health
clubs and nonprofit, tax-exempt centers like the YMCA now is
shifting to a courtroom with health clubs complaining they must
subsidize their competitors who save thousands a year in taxes. By
Liz Neporent. (800 words)
</P>

</P>
<P>
   _ Contrary to previous reports, women who drink moderately _ up
to one and a half alcoholic drinks a day _ may face no increased
risk of developing breast cancer, according to a decades-long study
of 5,000 women in Framingham, Mass. In fact, the study by
researchers at Boston University School of Medicine suggests that
breast cancer risk may even decline slightly as alcohol consumption
rises from none to one and a half drinks a day. But other research
is contradictory. (365 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ A California study of the rapidly growing number of women
having children after the age of 40 showed that, like their younger
counterparts, almost all of the women had healthy babies. But
things were a lot more complicated along the way, especially for
first-timers. (400 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Apple-shaped children _ those with more fat around the
midsection _ have more heart disease risk factors than their
pear-shaped peers, according to a study reported yesterday. (280
words)
</P>
<P>
   BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column: More than
60 percent of Americans get little or no exercise, despite repeated
reminders about the myriad rewards of regular physical activity.
But now there's good news for the idle. Two studies show that
people don't have to exercise in the traditional sense _ as in
jogging, aerobics and cycling _ to glean many of the health
benefits of activity, including weight control. All you have to do
is incorporate more movement into your daily routines. By Jane E.
Brody. (1225 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-STROKE-RECOVERY (Undated) _ Doctors have found a bold new
way of helping people who have had strokes recover the ability to
talk and move their limbs in the first weeks and months after brain
injury. Patients are given low doses of the common stimulant
amphetamine along with intense physical therapy _ a combination
that appears to accelerate recovery in many people. By Sandra
Blakeslee. (1370 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DOSAGE-CHIP (Undated) _ Engineers from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology have built a prototype of a sophistical
medicine delivery system: a kind of micropill, a dime-sized silicon
microchip that could release a combination of drugs on a
preprogrammed schedule or by remote control. By John O'Neil.
</P>

   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ Short items on science: on using an atomic
force microscope as a writing instrument, termites' mating habits
and measuring the way muscles work. (685 words)

otherwise. By Claiborne L. Ray. (300 words)

attack the Falcons. By Thomas George.

WHAT'S IN A NAME? A CENTURY COULD MAKE THE DIFFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHERINE SELIGMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Once, 20th Century Spring Manufacturing seemed
like a bold name. So did 20th Century Insurance, 20th Century Forum
and, of course, 20th Century Fox.
</P>
<P>
   But in 11 short months those names will seem instantly
old-fashioned. It might not compare in gravity to the looming year
2000 computer glitch, but millennial name angst is here.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 21st century technically does not begin until 2001,
the 20th century is likely to seem passe a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies with soon-to-be outdated monikers are scrambling
for new ones or at least studying the possibility. And if they
decide to modernize, it might not be easy to snag a name reflecting
the new century.
</P>
<P>
   More than 15,000 Web site names using ``2000'' and 600 using
``21st'' _ as in 21st century _ have been registered by Network
Solutions Inc., which has exclusive rights to register domain names
on the Internet. The glut includes everything from
virtualnanny2000.com and wrestlemania2000.com to
21stcenturystocks.com.
</P>
<P>
   And the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office already has more than
1,000 applications for the word millennium and close to 300 for
21st Century. From 21st Century Cable TV and 21st Century Toys to
the real estate giant Century 21 _ which has sued smaller companies
to keep their mitts off what it considers its territory _ scads of
names are taken. Already gone are Millennium Vanilla (taken by a
Philadelphia manufacturer) and ``the health drink of the 21st
Century'' (taken by the Massachusetts makers of Aloaide, an aloe
vera soda).
</P>
<P>
   ``Millennium, schmillennium'' is taken too, registered as the
``Official Mockery of the New Millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   A decision to change a company name may be more complicated than
plunking down money for a search and some new stationery, for loyal
customers might be lost in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``This company was started 40 years ago, and then it meant
advanced technology,'' said Mike Pavloff, operations manager at
20th Century Spring Manufacturing in Santa Clara, Calif., where
officials are pondering a name change. ``Now (the founder) is
saying, `What are we going to do?' There's controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, company employees were instructed to answer the phone
using the abbreviation TCS, but customers were confused, Pavloff
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought they got the wrong number,'' he said. ``Our first
shot would have to be a letter to customers'' explaining the name
change.
</P>
<P>
   At 20th Century Insurance near Los Angeles, that would be more
than 1 million customers. The company hasn't decided whether to
alter its name, but has sponsored four focus groups to test the
potential effects, spokesman Ric Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys showed that customers weren't bothered by the old name,
he said. But just in case, the company has reserved the right to
use 21st Century Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They associate the name with the level of service,'' Hill
said. ``Changing our name would be no inexpensive process. You've
got to change stationery, signs, notify customers and
shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Twentieth Century Forum, a nonprofit organization that supports
composers and sponsors new music concerts in the San Francisco
area, wouldn't use 21st Century Forum even if it were available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something about that is too unwieldy,'' said Executive
Director Steph Zlott, who nonetheless wants his organization _
which is about new, not old music _ to be identified with the
cutting edge. Sometime this year, the name will become New Music
Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. isn't changing its name, though
it has applied for rights to the name Twenty-First Century Fox. But
the movie studio probably has nothing to worry about in the name
department, since with some corporate giants ``the name becomes
inseparable with the product,'' said Edward Saentz, a brand
consultant at Interbrand.
</P>
<P>
   That may not be true for all companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would you think of doing business with 20th Century
Pharmaceuticals?'' Saentz said. ``That name would be detrimental.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Newbury, owner of 21st Century Home Improvement in San
Francisco, is happy with the date in his company's name. So happy
that he fought off colossal Century 21's attempt to take it away
from his small enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came to San Francisco and found someone who wasn't going
to knuckle under,'' said Henry Bunsrow, a lawyer who represented
Newbury in federal court. ``The court recognized that 21st Century
was a common name. Our position was that Century 21 didn't own
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The case was settled out of court last fall, with Newbury
keeping his name and agreeing to pay a ``nominal'' licensing fee to
Century 21. Officials from Century 21, which Bunsrow said wanted
the name for its own home improvement businesses, did not return a
telephone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   In order to use a new name, companies must make sure it's
available. Registering as a trademark requires filing an
application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
</P>
<P>
   By law, a trademark must be used for commercial purposes. This
differs from cyberspace, where it is possible to register a Web
site name just so someone else can't have it. ``Cybersquatters''
have been doing just that, then offering to sell the names to
interested parties. Someone even nabbed the name billgates.com, but
the megamillionaire hasn't shown interest in buying it.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, survival of the millennial name shake-up may call
for buying a T-shirt, tank top, jacket or bandanna emblazoned with
``I survived the 20th Century,'' a trademark phrase owned
exclusively by a man in Pontiac, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   And for those totally fed up with the problem, there is the 22nd
century to consider.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Abeleite, president of Twenty-Second Century Development, a
commercial development company in San Jose, Calif., did, and he is
happy he won't be around to see if that name gets obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan to get to about 106 but I won't make it to the next
millennium,'' he said. ``I'll leave that to another person.''

ENSURE THE PROGRAM THAT HELPS ENSURE OUR PROSPERITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Save Social Security first! That was the most commanding
challenge in President Clinton's State of the Union message. He
laid down the gauntlet for action this year.
</P>
<P>
   The way Congress responds to this call will be more important to
the American people than how the Senate wraps up the out-of-steam
impeachment imbroglio or how the legislative branch handles any
other recommendation in Clinton's hourlong address.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter what you think of Clinton personally. Love
him, hate him, admire or merely tolerate him _ Social Security is
larger than any politician's fate and bigger than either party's
pride.
</P>
<P>
   Americans may not know or really care much how their
congressional representative votes on a myriad of issues, including
some consequential ones.
</P>
<P>
   But the people are watching what Congress does this year with
Social Security. Lawmakers, be sure of that.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who remembers America before Social Security should know
how important it has been and is. It was the New Deal's most
significant and pervasive social innovation. Today it is the most
stabilizing institution of American society.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other single facet of 20th-century life, Social
Security has immunized this country from recurring economic
depressions. It has broadened the base of our American marketplace.
Banished the specter of the poorhouse. Cushioned the financial
problems, haunting fears and psychic agonies of aging. Freed
children from the economic strain of caring for dependent parents.
And, for countless millions, enriched life's twilight years with
dignity and self-respect.
</P>
<P>
   A fortunate few could complain egotistically that they've put
more into the fund than they'll ever personally draw out. But we of
whom that's true are among the program's most fortunate
beneficiaries. We have ridden the prosperity wave that it set in
motion.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, but we'd have done better individually, some argue, to have
put all those contributions into Coca-Cola stock. Be honest. How
many of us would have done that? How many of us did?
</P>
<P>
   And the question we pass over so glibly: Exactly how reliable
was the stock market before we had Social Security? In 1929, its
value shrank 40 percent in three months. Where would the Dow Jones,
that giddy reflection of our economic health, be today had it not
been for the steady discipline of Social Security's national
retirement savings plan that undergirds that economy?
</P>
<P>
   For years we've taken Social Security for granted. We've
borrowed from it to fight wars, build weapons and finance other
needs that we didn't want to pay for at the time. For 60 years its
trust fund reflected a healthy surplus. Policy-makers have drawn
from it _ sometimes to cut taxes and mask willful deficits. Now
it's payback time.
</P>
<P>
   If we want our grandchildren to enjoy Social Security's
blessings, as the four or five generations before them have done,
we'll make the task of reinforcing its declining balance our No. 1
priority. We'll do that first, before somebody fritters away or
divides up our immediate good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, we're like a family that has fallen heir to
unexpected wealth. We can invest it in blue chips and make sure our
children, and theirs, are never in need. Or we can cash it in, quit
work and take the family to Las Vegas while it lasts.
</P>
<P>
   Today, because of fortuitous planning or providential blessing,
we have a budgetary surplus for the first time in 30 years. At our
present rate of economic growth, the projected pattern of federal
revenues and expenditures, if continued, will yield foreseeable
surpluses reaching into the trillions during the first quarter of
the coming century.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants us to commit about 62 percent of those surpluses
over the next 15 years to building up an adequate reserve fund for
Social Security. He would have a board of independent experts
invest approximately one-fourth of that money in the stock market
on our behalf, hoping to increase its value. The remainder would be
invested, as at present, in U.S. Treasury bonds. They yield less
annual return than many stocks but are the safest investments on
earth.
</P>
<P>
   Nodding to Republican suggestions in a bid for bipartisan
cooperation, Clinton would approve letting about 1 percent of the
surplus support voluntary individual retirement accounts, giving
workers a supplementary source of old age income. Each would get an
annual lump sum to invest, with matching contributions from the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Some objections are heard to various phases of this plan. If
lawmakers don't like it, they should try to improve on it, not just
criticize and obstruct it. The president's outline amounts to
openers in the most important game that Congress can play this year
for the American people and our economy's future.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made a similar, though less specific, proposal last
year. This time he has fleshed it out. It is bold. It is concrete.
It isn't perfect. But it's far better than no plan at all. Congress
wasted last year and did nothing. It has already lost the first
month of 1999 _ the Senate debating impeachment charges, the House
in what amounts to a monthlong recess.
</P>
<P>
   Most folks are keenly aware of the problem looming ahead for our
Social Security trust fund as baby boomers reach retirement. People
are weary with inaction and fed up with diversions. If Congress
doesn't like the president's plan, for whatever reason, then let's
see a better one.
</P>
<P>
   The American people expect action this year _ thoughtful,
decisive action. They deserve no less.
</P>

 &HT;    TV MAVERICK TURNER TAKES A CHARITABLE TURN
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (f) Financial
categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVOS, Switzerland _ ``The more I've given away, the better I
feel about it,'' a super-rich Ted Turner told a small group of
fellow super-rich donors from around the world Monday at an
exclusive seminar entitled, ``You Can't Take It With You: Making
Philanthropy More Effective.''
</P>
<P>
   As vice-chairman of Time-Warner Inc., the always colorful Turner
is hardly in the same league as Microsoft Corp.'s Bill Gates, who
at that moment was sitting on a panel in a much larger room only
some 50 yards away. Gates, 43, has so far given away $4 billion
from a stash of Microsoft stock that has made him the world's
richest man.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Turner has been no slouch in that area either, having
pledged $1 billion of his own considerable fortune to the United
Nations and pushing for others to give. The generous gift added to
what was already a world-renowned reputation as a big-time
philanthropist, one which Turner will often downplay with a little
folksy rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live in a 700-foot apartment,'' Turner had told the Cox News
Service, referring to his loft at Atlanta's CNN Center, ``so I
could become homeless and jobless at the same time. I'm afraid to
leave the place. I do whatever I'm told to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will I have to retire at age 65?'' he asked. ``I don't know,
I'm afraid to ask. I'm married to Jane Fonda and I also do what she
tells me to do. But it's not so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   As is often the case, Turner, 60, somewhat exaggerated for
effect. But there was no doubting the fact that on his first visit
to the World Economic Forum, an annual conclave of the rich and
powerful, the maverick founder of CNN made a deeply favorable
impression on his fellow networking participants.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night at a session called, ``What Is Required for
Further Global Progress,'' Turner cast aside his prepared remarks
to deliver a 15-minute highly personal resume of his life and times
that ended with an emotional appeal for broader support for the
U.N.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, Turner and his wife dined with U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan as well as several newspaper editors and
columnists. ``Ted is a very great man,'' Annan said, recounting the
story of how, on an apparent spur of the moment, Turner told him he
planned to announce the huge gift the next day at a U.N. dinner to
be held in Turner's honor.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the philanthropic group on Monday, Turner said,
``When I first got the idea for helping the U.N., my thought was to
buy up the organization's debt and then sue the United States
government to pay up. But it proved to be too big a hunk and,
besides, I found out that our government wasn't legally liable to
pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I said to myself I'll just give the money the U.N. But then
my lawyers told me that there was no way that the body could accept
it. So I told them there must be some way to swing this cat. What
about (setting up) a foundation? They said that just might work.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner then set up the United Nations Foundation to deal with
such global issues as population control, improving the environment
and raising children's' health standards, particularly in the
developing world.
</P>
<P>
   But the charitable unit, which is open to all givers, has also
had its share of bureaucratic entanglements. ``God knows, the
General Assembly is not CNN,'' said Adele Simmons, president of the
MacArthur Foundation which, among other things, bankrolls ``genius
grants.'' Turner nodded in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   While in Davos, Turner also attended what he called ``a
billionaires' party,'' with some 20 attendees. ``We focused on
monitoring overseas giving in the developing world,'' he said. ``If
you're not careful, the money will disappear,''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Turner has bankrolled a private foundation that is
named after himself. ``We're giving away $12 million a year or
about 12 percent of our capital,'' Turner said in a brief interview
with the Cox News Service. ``We're dipping into capital and
planning to step up our spending. It will get the bulk of my money
when I'm gone.''
</P>
<P>
   A major current priority of the private foundation is
eradicating toxic wastes, Fonda noted.

   The first thing you notice about William Jefferson Clinton is
how tall he is. The second is the seductive power he has of making
you feel, from the first moment of meeting, that he is someone you
know well. The third is his sharp intelligence, which allows you to
speak to him about anything at all, even the prickliest topics,
provided you know when to bring it up.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, someone not enamored of him forewarned me: ``The
dangerous thing about these gifts is that Clinton uses them to make
you feel that nothing could interest him more than what you are
saying to him.''
</P>
<P>
   I met him first at a dinner given by William Styron in his
summer house in Martha's Vineyard in August of 1995. During his
first campaign, Clinton had mentioned that his favorite book was
``One Hundred Years of Solitude.'' I said at the time _ and I was
quoted in print _ that I thought he had said it simply to pull in
the Latin vote. He had not forgotten _ after greeting me in
Martha's Vineyard, he at once assured me that what he said had been
quite sincere.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Fuentes and I have good reason for considering that
evening as a whole chapter in our memoirs. From the beginning, we
were disarmed by the interest, respect and humor with which he
listened to us, treating our words as if they were gold dust.
</P>
<P>
   His mood corresponded with his appearance. His hair was short,
like a scrubbing brush, his skin tanned _ he had the healthy and
almost insolent look of a sailor ashore, and he was wearing a
college sweatshirt with some logo on the chest. At 49, he looked
like an exuberant survivor of the generation of '68, who had smoked
marijuana, knew the Beatles by heart and had demonstrated against
the Vietnam war.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner began at eight, with some 14 guests around the table, and
lasted until midnight. Bit by bit, the conversation came down to a
kind of literary round table involving the president and the three
writers. The first topic to come up was the forthcoming Summit of
the Americas. Clinton had wanted it held in Miami, where it did
take place. Carlos Fuentes considered that New Orleans or Los
Angeles had stronger historical claims, and he and I argued
strongly for them until it became clear that the president had no
intention of changing his plans because he was counting on
reelection support from Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget the votes, Mr. President,'' Carlos said to him. ``Lose
Florida and make history.''
</P>
<P>
   That phrase set the tone. When we spoke of the problems of
narco-traffic, the president heard me out generously. ``Thirty
million drug addicts in the U.S. go to show that the North American
mafia are more powerful than those in Colombia, and the authorities
much more corrupt.'' When I spoke to him about relations with Cuba,
he seemed even more receptive. ``If Fidel and you could sit and
talk face to face, all problems would completely disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   When we talked about Latin America in general, we realized that
he was much more interested than we had supposed, although he
lacked some essential background. When the conversation seemed to
stiffen a bit, we asked him what his favorite movie was, and he
answered ``High Noon,'' by Fred Zinneman, whom he had recently
honored in London. When we asked him what he was reading, he sighed
and mentioned a book on the economic wars of the future, author and
title unknown to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better to read `Don Quixote,''' I said to him. ``Everything's
in there.'' Now, the `Quixote' is a book that is not read nearly as
much as is claimed, although very few will admit to not having read
it. With two or three quotes, Clinton showed that he knew it very
well indeed. Responding, he asked us what our favorite books were.
Styron said his was ``Huckleberry Finn.''
</P>
<P>
   I would have said ``Oedipus Rex,'' which has been my bedtable
book for the last 20 years, but I named ``The Count of Monte
Cristo,'' mainly for reasons of technique, which I had some trouble
explaining.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his was the ``Meditations of Marcus Aurelius,'' and
Carlos Fuentes stuck loyally to ``Absalom, Absalom,'' Faulkner's
stellar novel, no question, although others would choose ``Light in
August'' for purely personal reasons. Clinton, in homage to
Faulkner, got to his feet and, pacing round the table, recited from
memory Benji's monologue, the most thrilling passage, and perhaps
the most hermetic, from ``The Sound and the Fury.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner got us to talking about the affinities between
Caribbean writers and the cluster of great Southern novelists in
the United States. It made much more sense to us to think of the
Caribbean not as a geographical region surrounded by its sea but as
a much wider historical and cultural belt stretching from the north
of Brazil to the Mississippi basin.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Twain, William Faulkner, John Steinbeck and so many others
would then be just as Caribbean as Jorge Amado and Derek Walcott.
Clinton, born and raised in Arkansas, a southern state, applauded
the notion and professed himself happy to be a Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   It was close to midnight, and he had to break off the
conversation to take an urgent call from Gerry Adams, to whom at
that moment he gave the authority to campaign and raise funds in
the United States for peace in Northern Ireland. That should have
been the ending to an unforgettable evening, but Carlos Fuentes
took it further by asking the president who he thought of as his
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   His reply was immediate and abrupt: ``My only enemy is
right-wing religious fundamentalism.'' That pronouncement ended the
evening. The other times I saw him, in public or in private, I had
the same impression as I had that first time. Bill Clinton was the
complete opposite of the idea Latin Americans have of presidents of
the United States.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given all that, does it seem right that this exceptional human
being should be prevented from fulfilling his historical destiny
simply because he was unable to find a private place to make love?
That is just what happened. The most powerful man in the world was
kept from consummating his secret passions by the invisible
presence of a secret service that served as much to restrain as to
protect.
</P>
<P>
   There are no curtains on the Oval Office windows, no bolt on the
door of the president's private bathroom. The vase of flowers that
appears behind the president in photographs of him at his desk has
been claimed by the press to be a hiding-place for microphones to
consecrate the mysteries of presidential audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Even sadder, however, is the fact that the president only wanted
to do what the run of men have done in private with their women
from the beginning of the world, and a puritan stolidity not only
impeded him, but even denied him the right to deny it.
</P>
<P>
   Jonas invented the literature of fiction when he convinced his
wife that his homecoming was three days late because a whale had
swallowed him. Sheltering behind that ancient argument, Clinton
denied having any sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, and denied
it with his head held high, like any self-respecting unfaithful
husband. In the end, his personal drama is a purely domestic
matter, between himself and Hillary, and she has stood by him in
the eyes of the world with Homeric dignity.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to lie in order to deceive; but it is quite
another to conceal truths in order to protect that mythical
dimension of human existence that is private life. Quite rightly,
no one is obliged to give evidence against himself. For having
persisted in his first denials, Clinton would have been prosecuted
in any case _ that's what it was about _ but it is much more
dignified to perjure oneself defending the privacy of the heart
than to be absolved at the expense of love.
</P>
<P>
   Disastrously, with the same insistence with which he had denied
blame, he later admitted it and went on admitting it over all the
media, written, visual and spoken, to the point of humiliation _ a
fatal error in an uncertain lover, whose secret life will go into
the history books not for having made love badly but for having
made it a lot less glorious than it should be.
</P>
<P>
   Ludicrously, he submitted to oral sex while he talked on the
telephone with a senator. He supplanted himself with a frigid
cigar. He naturally used all kinds of tricks of avoidance, but the
more he tried the more his inquisitors came up with evidence
against him, for puritanism is insatiable and feeds on its own
excrement.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a vast and sinister conspiracy of fanatics aimed at
the personal destruction of a political adversary whose stature
they could not abide. The method was the criminal use of justice by
a fundamentalist prosecutor called Kenneth Starr, whose fierce and
salacious questioning seemed to excite these fanatics to the point
of orgasm.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Bill Clinton we met some four months ago, at a gala dinner
in the White House for Andres Pastrana, president of Colombia,
seemed quite different _ no longer the open-minded academic of
Martha's Vineyard, but someone under sentence, thinner and
uncertain, who could not conceal with a professional smile an
organic weariness like the metal fatigue that destroys planes.
</P>
<P>
   Some days before, at a press dinner with Katherine Graham, the
golden woman of The Washington Post, someone had remarked that,
judging by the trials of Clinton, the United States still seemed to
be the country of Nathaniel Hawthorne. That night in the White
House, I realized just what that meant.
</P>
<P>
   The reference was to the great American novelist of last
century, who denounced in his work the horrors of New England
fundamentalism, where the witches of Salem were burned alive. His
main novel, ``The Scarlet Letter,'' is the drama of Hester Prynne,
a young married woman who bore a child in secret by another man. A
Kenneth Starr of the day condemned her to wear a penitent's shirt
bearing the letter ``A'' of the puritan code, the color and smell
of blood.
</P>
<P>
   An agent of the order followed her everywhere beating a drum so
that pedestrians could keep out of her way. The ending must surely
keep prosecutor Starr awake, for the secret father of Hester's
child turned out to be a minister of the cult that made a martyr of
her.
</P>
<P>
   The method and the morality of the procedures were essentially
the same. When Clinton's enemies failed to find what they needed to
bring him down, they hounded him with mined interrogations until
they trapped him here and there in minor inconsistencies. Then they
forced him to accuse himself in public, and to apologize for things
he had not even done, live, using the technology of universal
information that is nothing more than a trimillennial version of
the drums that persecuted Hester Prynne.
</P>
<P>
   From the prosecutor's questions, cunning and concupiscent, even
small children became aware of the lies their parents told to keep
from them how they came into being. Suffering from metal fatigue,
Clinton committed the unpardonable folly of violently punishing an
invented enemy 5,397 nautical miles from the White House, to
distract attention from his personal plight.
</P>
<P>
   Toni Morrison, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature and a
great writer of this agonizing century, summed it up in one
inspired phrase:
</P>
<P>
   ``They treated him like a black president.''

MINORITY VOTE FIGURES FOR BUSH RE-EXAMINED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It quickly became the stuff of political legend.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls showed Gov. George W. Bush won half of the Hispanic
vote in his November re-election, and within weeks, the figure was
spread in national and international reports about a potential
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans, who typically get about a quarter of the
Hispanic vote, the exit poll numbers seemed unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   And they may be.
</P>
<P>
   A closer look at what really happened on Election Day indicates
that Bush got significantly less than the 49 percent of the
Hispanic vote that he was credited with in the exit poll conducted
on behalf of major television networks and newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts and polls declare that Bush's Hispanic vote totals
were between the upper 30s and the lower 40s.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is important, given the flood of attention that
Bush received for a White House bid following his Nov. 3
gubernatorial win.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers, magazines and television stations throughout the
United States and abroad have given extensive coverage to Bush's
purported Hispanic vote totals, repeating the 49 percent figure as
fact. Even the governor's own official biography on a state Web
site touts the 49 percent figure.
</P>
<P>
   The poll results were cited by the Bush camp as proof that a
compassionate conservative leader can ``erase the gender gap, open
the doors of the Republican Party to new faces and new voices, and
win without sacrificing principles.''
</P>
<P>
   The exit poll conducted election night by the Voter News Service
of New York _ which continues to be used by all major television
networks and newspapers _ showed that Bush got 49 percent of the
Hispanic vote and 27 percent of the black vote.
</P>
<P>
   But Rice University political scientist Bob Stein, who helped
design the questionnaire in Texas for the Voter News Service, said
Bush's showing among Hispanics, while extraordinary, was not as
strong as the original survey showed.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bush's vote percentage among Hispanics, after adjusting
the data with appropriate weighting for precinct anomalies, was
somewhere between ``the high 30s and low 40s.'' He said Bush's
percentage among black voters was probably in the low 20s.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign referred calls about the exit poll to the
governor's consultant, Karl Rove. Attempts to reach Rove were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   For Texas Democrats still smarting over their crushing defeat in
the state elections _ they lost every statewide office _
calculating the magnitude of Bush's support among minorities is not
idle nit-picking.
</P>
<P>
   If the traditional Democratic coalition is falling apart, to the
benefit of their rivals, they might be politically doomed.
</P>
<P>
   Stein's take on the Hispanic vote jibes with two other exit
polls done on Election Day. An exit survey done by the Willie
Velasquez Institute in San Antonio showed Bush got 39 percent of
the vote, while Democrat Garry Mauro received 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A second exit poll, conducted in El Paso by a professor at the
University of Texas at El Paso, showed Bush got 37 percent of the
Hispanic vote there. (Bush won El Paso County by just over 600
votes, the first Republican governor to win the county.)
</P>
<P>
   Getting that level of Hispanic support is exceptionally high,
but not necessarily unprecedented for a Republican. Ronald Reagan
is estimated to have won at least 40 percent of the Hispanic vote
in Texas in his landslide 1984 presidential re-election victory.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders Anderson, a political scientist at Texas Southern
University, said Bush got ``an unusually high percentage'' of the
black vote, although not as much as his brother Jeb Bush, the new
Florida governor.
</P>
<P>
   Exit surveys, so named because they are taken as voters ``exit''
the voting booths, are used heavily by networks and news services
so that winners can be projected in time for the evening newscast
or morning newspaper delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Murray Edelman, editorial director of Voter News Service
acknowledged that his exit survey is not designed specifically for
racial breakdowns but rather for calling elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This exit poll is not geared toward giving you the best
possible estimate of the Hispanic vote,'' Edelman said. ``We're
geared toward projecting a winner. If I were doing a Hispanic
study, we would design it differently.''
</P>
<P>
   The margin of error for the racial breakdowns in his poll
(including both blacks and Hispanics), for example, is plus or
minus 8 percentage points. The Willie Velasquez poll had a margin
of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Edelman also noted that only four of the 30 precincts he used
for surveys were in heavily Hispanic areas. But he said the
discrepancy with other polls could be explained by Bush's better
showing among Hispanics in areas that aren't dominated by them.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Democratic consultant Peck Young called Bush's inroads
into the Hispanic vote an ``interesting but totally personal
phenomenon from which the GOP should take little long-term
comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stein and others say dissecting the numbers misses the
larger point, which is that Bush's approach and message cut deeply
into the Democratic coalition: ``It ain't about the percentage,''
Stein said. ``It's about getting more votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Campos, a Democratic political consultant in Houston who
specializes in Hispanic candidates and issues, said Bush attracted
Hispanics by rejecting harsh stances on immigration and other
divisive issues associated with such Republicans as former
California Gov. Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Bankrolling a massive TV ad campaign _ in both Spanish and
English _ didn't hurt either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a heavy media presence,'' Campos said. ``I give Bush
four stars for knowing how to play the game. He is good. He is
good.''

<P>
   The visit of Madeleine Albright, U.S. secretary of state, to
Moscow in late January was apparently cordial, with smiles and even
friendly embraces.
</P>
<P>
   For good measure, Mrs. Albright recalled the old formula of
U.S.-Russian ``strategic partnership,'' which must have pleased the
sickly Russian president. All of this, however, only underscored
that both sides had good reasons not to dramatize the obvious
problems in their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   In itself, the fact that the dialogue has not been broken off
and is proceeding in a civilized tone is welcome. But it would be
wrong to minimize or try to gloss over the seriousness of the
discord that has emerged. In fact, it goes far beyond U.S.-Russian
relations as such.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate this point, let us look at recent history.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, as leader of the Soviet Union, I and the rest
of our new Soviet leadership sought ways to radically improve the
situation in the world. It was clear to us that this could not be
done without cooperation with the United States. It took a lot of
hard work by both sides, including successive summits and tough
arms-control treaty negotiations, to end the Cold War with America
and start building a partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Interaction between the vast Soviet Union, and later Russia
alone, and the United States was to be a pivotal factor in shaping
new international politics as a whole. Now if this pillar weakens,
the consequences must affect far more than just the two nations.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the root causes of what is happening, I would say
that the Russian political establishment bears much of the
responsibility for the gap, the imbalance, in the U.S.-Russian
relationship. By abolishing the Union with the other former Soviet
Republics, from which Russia derived so much power, my successors
left America without a strong and credible partner.
</P>
<P>
   Very quickly, the United States succumbed to the euphoria of
``victory in the Cold War,'' and the whole idea of a cooperation of
equals to bring about a better world _ the kind of cooperation that
ended the Cold War and helped to untie the knots of some
longstanding conflicts _ was eventually forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   So when Russian politicians complain that the United States is
ignoring Russia's views, yes, they have a point. But it is not
something that began today, or even yesterday. And they have
themselves to blame for much of it.
</P>
<P>
   As a dominating power, stronger in every way than Russia, the
United States, which had been the Soviet Union's equal partner,
acts in ways that, instead of untying the knots of conflicts, ties
some of them even tighter.
</P>
<P>
   For example, defying the views of key members of the U.N.
Security Council, it imposed a unilateral will as regards the
policy toward Iraq, and the policy went badly astray. Instead of
implementing UNSCOM's mandate and normalizing life in the region,
U.S. actions had dire results: a breakup of the coalition that
helped reverse Iraq's aggression toward Kuwait. One-sided Western
policies in the former Yugoslavia had similar consequences.
</P>
<P>
   And yet few lessons have been learned. It is all too obvious,
and very dangerous, that this ``new world disorder'' has inspired
little humility in the West. Today the United States is not working
to restore genuine interaction within the United Nations and other
multilateral mechanisms. Instead, Washington is seeking to
rationalize and justify its policy of totally ignoring the Security
Council. It is also giving NATO, which is dominated by U.S. policy,
the functions of a self-appointed world policeman.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, the United States is undermining the momentous
1972 arms-control treaty which limited anti-ballistic missile
systems. Recently, much soothing rhetoric has surrounded this, but
in fact the U.S. secretary of defense has stated publicly that
America could withdraw from the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder that this kind of behavior has caused a backlash
in Russia, however weakened the nation is. True, Russia has
sometimes overreacted, but it's a big mistake to call its reaction
a trivial resentment _ so-called sour grapes _ at the loss of
superpower status. After all, Russia is very clearly not alone in
objecting to these tendencies in U.S. foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States continues to push aside countries that seek
equitable relationships, it may well find itself standing alone, or
in serious contention with many governments on all kinds of issues.
The outcome would only be negative for international politics, and
for all people in the world.
</P>
<P>
   What a shame that in President Clinton's much-praised State of
the Union message, Russia was no longer regarded as a partner in
need of support but rather as a source of potential threats to be
defused. It is important for us to cooperate in eliminating weapons
of mass destruction _ but is this the only area of relations with
Russia to be mentioned by the U.S. president to the American
people?
</P>
<P>
   For many years, the U.S. policy has been focussed on personal,
strong support for the figure of the Russian president. This policy
has failed, as I have many times said it would. But I feel that not
nearly enough has been done to draw the proper conclusions from
this error.
</P>
<P>
   A serious course correction is needed in U.S. policy. Without
it, Mrs. Albright's happy assurances that relations with Russia are
developing positively will sound increasingly hollow.

<P>
   Very quickly, the United States succumbed to the euphoria of
``victory in the Cold War,'' and the whole idea of a cooperation of
equals to bring about a better world _ the kind of cooperation that
ended the Cold War and helped to untie the knots of some
longstanding conflicts _ was eventually forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   So when Russian politicians complain that the United States is
ignoring Russia's views, yes, they have a point. But it is not
something that began today, or even yesterday. And they have
themselves to blame for much of it.
</P>
<P>
   As a dominating power, stronger in every way than Russia, the
United States, which had been the Soviet Union's equal partner,
acts in ways that, instead of untying the knots of conflicts, ties
some of them even tighter.
</P>
<P>
   For example, defying the views of key members of the U.N.
Security Council, it imposed a unilateral will as regards the
policy toward Iraq, and the policy went badly astray. Instead of
implementing UNSCOM's mandate and normalizing life in the region,
U.S. actions had dire results: a breakup of the coalition that
helped reverse Iraq's aggression toward Kuwait. One-sided Western
policies in the former Yugoslavia had similar consequences.
</P>
<P>
   And yet few lessons have been learned. It is all too obvious,
and very dangerous, that this ``new world disorder'' has inspired
little humility in the West. Today the United States is not working
to restore genuine interaction within the United Nations and other
multilateral mechanisms. Instead, Washington is seeking to
rationalize and justify its policy of totally ignoring the Security
Council. It is also giving NATO, which is dominated by U.S. policy,
the functions of a self-appointed world policeman.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, the United States is undermining the momentous
1972 arms-control treaty which limited anti-ballistic missile
systems. Recently, much soothing rhetoric has surrounded this, but
in fact the U.S. secretary of defense has stated publicly that
America could withdraw from the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder that this kind of behavior has caused a backlash
in Russia, however weakened the nation is. True, Russia has
sometimes overreacted, but it's a big mistake to call its reaction
a trivial resentment _ so-called sour grapes _ at the loss of
superpower status. After all, Russia is very clearly not alone in
objecting to these tendencies in U.S. foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States continues to push aside countries that seek
equitable relationships, it may well find itself standing alone, or
in serious contention with many governments on all kinds of issues.
The outcome would only be negative for international politics, and
for all people in the world.
</P>
<P>
   What a shame that in President Clinton's much-praised State of
the Union message, Russia was no longer regarded as a partner in
need of support but rather as a source of potential threats to be
defused. It is important for us to cooperate in eliminating weapons
of mass destruction _ but is this the only area of relations with
Russia to be mentioned by the U.S. president to the American
people?
</P>
<P>
   For many years, the U.S. policy has been focussed on personal,
strong support for the figure of the Russian president. This policy
has failed, as I have many times said it would. But I feel that not
nearly enough has been done to draw the proper conclusions from
this error.
</P>
<P>
   A serious course correction is needed in U.S. policy. Without
it, Mrs. Albright's happy assurances that relations with Russia are
developing positively will sound increasingly hollow.

WHY DON'T WE CARE ABOUT THE SLAUGHTER IN THE BALKANS? (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM MADIGAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First, a quiz: Where is Srebrenica, and what is its
significance?
</P>
<P>
   These are not trick questions. More than 400 stories in my
newspaper since 1992 contain references to Srebrenica, not to
mention hundreds of additional reports on radio and television.
</P>
<P>
   Yet until the day before last, I would have failed my own test.
I did not know Srebrenica was a town in Bosnia, nor that in July
1995, 7,000 Muslim men who lived there were marched off and
slaughtered by Serbian soldiers, their hands wired behind them as
they were shot in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those newspaper stories labeled the massacres of
Srebrenica the worst European atrocity since World War II. But to
me, they never happened. How many of you passed the quiz?
</P>
<P>
   My belated introduction to Srebrenica came after a much more
recent tragedy in the Balkans: 45 ethnic Albanians from the Serbian
province of Kosovo slaughtered in a ditch. Television footage
showed bloated bodies in colorful clothes heaped one atop another.
Some had their eyes gouged out. Another man in the village of Racak
lay decapitated near his home. The victims included a young woman,
a boy not much older than my 7-year-old son, and several elderly
men.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted by those images in a Sunday evening newscast, the
ongoing Balkan tragedy finally grabbed me. I was horrified and
mystified by hatreds that could engender such cruelty. Why now, and
not five years ago as children dodged bullets in Sarajevo, I can't
really say. I do know that my concern feels woefully tardy. And I
know that in this country I am not alone. Which leads to another
question: Where the Balkans are concerned, why do so few of us seem
to care?
</P>
<P>
   The answer may be as complex as the Balkan animosities
themselves. To blame our collective indifference on selfishness
alone is to miss the lingering influences of our history, and the
significance of geography (buffered on both sides by oceans) that
has made this country unique.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, minding our own business is an American tradition,
historians say. None other than President George Washington, in his
farewell address, warned against foreign alliances that might
jeopardize American freedom or interests, a sentiment also endorsed
by Thomas Jefferson and other early American presidents, says Gene
A. Smith, an associate professor of American history at Texas
Christian University in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   That tradition of isolationism continued through the 19th
century and beyond. The United States was only reluctantly dragged
into both world wars. The Cold War effectively shattered old
notions that we could hunker down and go it alone, but foreign
entanglements were justified then almost exclusively by the fear of
communism's spread. It was the realpolitik of Nixon's Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger: foreign action was justified only when it
served the nation's strategic self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1977 with the administration of Jimmy Carter, our
government's stance softened. Humanitarian concerns now
occasionally dictate U.S. foreign policy. The Balkans are an
example. Though the region lacks critical strategic significance,
the United States brokered a peace treaty between the Bosnians and
Serbs in a 1995 summit in Dayton, Ohio. American troops were the
backbone of Bosnian peacekeeping forces. American diplomats are
deeply involved as the dangers escalate in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But we average Americans maintain our remove, by and large,
content to live in ``geographic illiteracy,'' as TCU's Smith calls
it. It's a notion promoted by humankind's natural inclination to
avoid unpleasantness, and the seeming security of living with
oceans on either side.
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary philosopher Sam Keen finds yet another cause of our
Balkan ambivalence: The complexity of problems there. Keen says
that despite studying the causes of the conflict, he has yet to
fully understand them. Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic rivals
Saddam Hussein as evil's reigning poster boy, but beyond that, very
little is clear about the conflicts in that region. Enmity between
Serbian Orthodox Christians and Muslims dates back centuries.
Innocents are in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes too much sustained attention to know what's going on,
so I think our tendency is to block it out,'' Keen says. ``We're a
very pragmatic people in that sense. We don't like to give
attention to instances of evil and tragedy where we can't think of
what we would do, if we could do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans, he says, necessarily put on the blinders to avoid
what he calls ``compassion fatigue.'' Somewhere in the world is a
new slaughter almost every day, a new famine, more photographs of
starving children in a far-off place where rebels hinder attempts
at humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're baffled,'' Keen says. ``We don't know how to do good
anymore. So often, the old, clear answers are not good answers.''

UNDATED: good answers.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Keen often encourages audiences at his lectures to keep their
blinders intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them to forget the massive thing of evil out there or
you're going to feel impotent because of it all,'' he says. ``But I
tell them to choose something to find out about. Pick an issue.
Maybe it's land mines or nuclear weapons or unlimited arms sales.
Find out enough about it so you know what to do. Then forget about
Kosovo. Or find out about Kosovo, learn what it is we should be
doing there.''
</P>
<P>
   Then forget about the other places, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the wrong tack to take is that tack that says, `Oh,
we're guilty. We should feel guilty about everything,' '' Keen
says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Brooks Harrington, an ordained minister and now a Fort Worth
trial lawyer, says it's not just distant tragedies we ignore. We
drive by Kosovos every day, past neighborhoods of suffering people
different from ourselves. As in Kosovo, Harrington says, it seems
part of human nature to want to look the other way.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington recalls his experiences as pastor of Diamond Hill
United Methodist Church in a struggling neighborhood of Fort
Worth's north side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diamond Hill was two miles from downtown,'' Harrington says.
``I would go down there and tell stories about kids who lived in
homes without running water, or no heat in the wintertime, and
people would be shocked. But what really pressed their buttons was
when I would start to talk about gangs, and how the gangs were
spreading into their neighborhoods. Then a lot of people would get
interested who wouldn't otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Balkans were oil-rich, or if Serbian terrorists attacked
U.S. interests, troubles in that part of the world would have been
settled long ago, Harrington believes. It boils down to
self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two most destructive words in the English language are
`us' and `them,''' Harrington says. ``A lot of what ethics is about
is `Where do you draw the line?' Everybody draws one, but where do
you draw it? To some people the only `us' is me. To some people,
the only `us' is my family. To some people, the only `us' is people
of my race or people of my class.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start getting into more sublime areas of ethics when you
start realizing the distinctions between `us' and `them' are
suspect. It's all `we.' But as a practical matter, how do you live
that out?''
</P>
<P>
   In a world in which the United States is the only superpower,
the question will increasingly beg an answer, says Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation needs to focus on certain questions of terrorism
and how that's going to play in years to come,'' Smith says. ``But
there's also this question of what humanitarian mission should the
United States play.''
</P>
<P>
   Few Americans can now venture an informed opinion. I was among
those who until recently was content to look the other way. Then I
saw the recent footage of bodies in the ditch, and learned of
Srebrenica. And for some reason a hard reality finally dawned: Only
happenstance and geography stand between me and the same fate.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, where the Balkans are concerned, it seems worth my
while to pay attention. Oceans or not, Srebrenica doesn't seem so
far away.

INSIDE STORY OF NATURE'S FOUL-TASTING BEAUTIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, Colo., Ariz.)   (af)  
 By CAROL KAESUK YOON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many of the world's most astonishingly beautiful creatures _
from fluorescent frogs to iridescent butterflies _ are the most
poisonous. Their bodies laced with toxins, these animals find
safety not in hiding from their enemies but in drawing attention to
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They adorn their foul-tasting flesh in a rainbow of
easy-to-remember warning colors, vividly reminding every predator
that has had the misfortune to taste one never to try again.
</P>
<P>
   The basic principle is familiar to anyone who has had food
poisoning. The mere sight of the offending food, even an innocent
tuna sandwich, say, can evoke memories that make a diner look
elsewhere for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   But while biologists have understood the warning function of
animal colors for more than a century, they have been unable to
figure out how they could have evolved. That is because bright
colors keep an animal safe only if there are enough brightly
colored animals around for predators to learn their lesson by
taste-testing.
</P>
<P>
   How, biologists have puzzled, did that first brightly colored
mutant, so much more obvious than all the other duller animals,
avoid being chewed up, spat out and forgotten, ending the
evolutionary experiment for good?
</P>
<P>
   Now research reported in a recent issue of the journal Nature
suggests that one way to get around this problem is simply by being
flexible. Dr. Gregory A. Sword, an evolutionary ecologist at Oxford
University, has discovered that when young grasshoppers of one
species in Texas grow up alone, a situation in which warning colors
would only make them more vulnerable to being eaten, they develop a
``cryptic'' coloration that hides them well amid the greenery of
their surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   However, when the grasshoppers grow up in a large group eating a
plant that makes them toxic to their predators, the young typically
develop a bright yellow and black warning coloration that provides
safety in numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Natural selection should, in theory, favor a species that can
be cryptic at low densities and conspicuous at high densities,''
Sword said, ``and I stumbled onto a species that does just that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sword said he first had an inkling that the grasshoppers' colors
might be a warning of toxicity when he saw a laboratory lizard spit
one out and refuse to eat it. To verify, he ate one of his study
subjects. ``I chewed up the entire insect,'' he said, ``Sure
enough, it was disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jim Mallet, an evolutionary biologist at University College
London, called the research ``quite clever,'' saying, ``It makes
evolutionary sense and it is a very neat set of experiments.''
</P>
<P>
   Sword studied the grasshopper, known by the scientific name
Schistocerca emarginata, while a graduate student at the University
of Texas at Austin. In the field, he found large numbers of yellow
and black grasshoppers all feeding on one particular toxic plant
species known as Skunk Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Growing the grasshoppers under different conditions, he found
that crowding them was the key to turning on their bright
coloration and raising them alone the key to making them cryptic.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his own taste tests, Sword used lizards to show
that these on-again, off-again colors could function as warning
signals. Lizards that were fed the grasshoppers raised on Skunk
Bush spat out the grasshoppers and later avoided any yellow and
black individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Most warning-colored organisms do not have this grasshopper's
ability to be differently colored under different conditions, but
researchers say Sword's study may still help solve the riddle of
how their warning coloration emerged in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The grasshoppers may be providing a snapshot of one step in the
evolutionary process, an example of an initial stage of flexibility
that serves a first step in the evolution of full-time warning
coloration.
</P>
<P>
   While many animals use warning coloration to advertise their own
unpalatability, warning colors can send a variety of messages. For
example, bees and wasps have a memorable yellow and black pattern
that warns not of toxicity in their flesh, but of the pain of their
sting.
</P>
<P>
   Coral snakes with their colorful red, yellow and black rings
warn of a venomous bite. Still other animals capitalize on the
warning features of others, evolving the patterns that say
``Danger!'' but not the poisons or stings to back the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Deane Bowers, an evolutionary ecologist at the University of
Colorado at Boulder, said the new work was one of several
interesting ideas being floated to explain the evolution of warning
coloration.
</P>
<P>
   Another hypothesis is that the first warning-colored insect was
so hardy and strong that it could go it alone, able to be bitten
and spat out and then walk away. Researchers have found that, over
all, animals with warning coloration seem to survive attacks
better.
</P>
<P>
   These bright colors even puzzled Darwin. He had thought that
showy hues, like the elaborate plumage of many male birds,
functioned to attract mates and enhance courtship success.
</P>
<P>
   How then was one to explain these colors in caterpillars, which
would not mate until they were butterflies? Darwin's rival, Alfred
Russel Wallace, who independently deduced the principle of natural
selection but lost the race to publish the theory, correctly
surmised that the colors could serve to warn off predators.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Texas study has shown biologists one way in which such
vivid warning colors can evolve. The new study also provides
insight into the swarming behavior of a close relative of the Texas
grasshopper, the desert locust, arguably the most devastating of
all insects. The desert locusts' ravenous swarms are described in
both the Bible and the Koran.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all the locust species, in fact, you have this dramatic
color change from green when solitary to orange or red and black as
they become gregarious,'' and just before they swarm, said Dr. Reg
Chapman, a grasshopper specialist at the University of Arizona at
Tucson. ``Nobody understood what the point of it was.''
</P>
<P>
   The new study suggests that perhaps this color change is a
warning coloration as well, one that might facilitate swarming.
</P>
<P>
   If locusts begin eating toxic plants in large numbers, these
hordes will switch on their warning coloration and can begin
fending off predators more effectively. This protection could allow
them to reach higher and higher densities, eventually sending them
flying off on their famous eating rampages that can stretch from
India through Africa.
</P>
<P>
   A locust that once flew in crop-eating swarms about the United
States, the rocky mountain locust, mysteriously became extinct
around the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is a sign that at least somewhere out there is a
predator that likes its food bitter but beautiful.

HOSPITALS ON SHAKY GROUND AS THEY TRY TO MEET QUAKE SAFETY CODES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A law requiring California's 450 hospitals to
meet earthquake safety standards by 2008 could cost up to $20
billion in the coming years and lead to higher health care costs.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital groups say some directors may find retrofitting costs
prohibitive and decide to rebuild instead. Others may be forced to
close their facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This law has incredible ramifications for health-care delivery
and for consumers,'' said Roger Richter, senior vice president of
professional services for the California Healthcare Association in
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1994 law, hospitals have until Jan. 1, 2001, to submit
plans to the state on how they will meet the seismic standards.
Anxiety is already evident, however, in a health-care industry
faced with a mandate but without ready means to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the most profound piece of legislation that
will impact hospitals for the next 50 years,'' said Nathan Nayman,
head of the Hospital Council of Northern and Central California, a
San Francisco-based trade association.
</P>
<P>
   The law imposes a uniform standard of seismic safety for
hospitals statewide _ to withstand a magnitude-7 or greater
earthquake _ regardless of the level or risk of their seismic
zones.
</P>
<P>
   The state's 450 acute-care hospitals _ facilities offering
medical, nursing, surgical, anesthesia, laboratory, radiology,
pharmacy and dietary services _ have among them some 1,300 separate
buildings that will need structural changes or have to be rebuilt,
according to a California Healthcare estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them will be closed or turned over for administrative or
other uses by the Jan. 1, 2008 deadline. (By a third deadline, Jan.
1, 2030, California hospitals must meet an even higher standard of
compliance.)
</P>
<P>
   Then-Gov. Pete Wilson signed the law in 1994 after the
Northridge earthquake in which several Southern California
hospitals were damaged. The intent of the law is to ensure the
facilities withstand powerful earthquake so they can serve the
injured.
</P>
<P>
   The law also required that they meet safety standards imposed
after the 1971 San Fernando Valley earthquake in which 47 people
were killed when a Veterans Administration Hospital in Sylmar
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Rural hospitals are especially vulnerable because of the high
cost of compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any (pre-1973) rural two-story hospital is in a world of
hurt,'' said Sharon Avery, executive director of the Rural Health
Care Center, part of the California Healthcare Association. Rural
Health Care represents 72 small facilities in towns of fewer than
15,000 people. Almost all of them are affected by the law, she
said, and it's unclear how they would meet the requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at the beginning of the end,'' said Charles
Norton, administrator of Biggs-Gridley Memorial Hospital in
Gridley. ``These are our alternatives: shut the doors; make a
Band-Aid station out of it; make a clinic building out of it; see
if the people in the community want to invest in a fund-raising
campaign to make it seismically sound _ perhaps for $2 million _ or
affiliate with a larger group,'' Norton said.
</P>
<P>
   Retired State Sen. Alfred Alquist, D-San Jose, who guided the
1994 seismic bill through the Legislature, said it was a compromise
among various health and state interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great problem we have in government is how much safety can
we afford,'' he said. ``There is no such thing as absolute safety
so it's a constant battle to get the best you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, Kaiser Permanente has voluntarily spent some $300
million on seismic improvements to its 26 acute-care hospitals in
the state. By 2008 the total may reach $2 billion, said Kip
Edwards, senior vice president for facilities at the Oakland-based
health company.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser plans to replace its downtown Los Angeles and Fontana
hospitals, Edwards said. Others facilities, including those in
Walnut Creek and Vallejo, are being upgraded. All other Kaiser
sites are being inspected to determine what work needs to be done,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic Healthcare West, which operates St. Mary's and St.
Francis Memorial medical centers in San Francisco and five other
area facilities, also is in the process of analyzing its needs _
and possible sources of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the state should help the industry renovate and develop
sufficient capacity,'' said Wade Rose, a vice president for
Catholic Healthcare West.
</P>
<P>
   ``The communities will ultimately demand that a public health
crisis is not created by the demand to implement the regulations _
the crisis being the lack of adequate health care facilities,''
Rose said.

<P>
   It is the stuff of people, as well as cats, plants, buttons,
shoes, seas, planets, comets, moons, cars, books and cell phones,
not to mention the paper (or computer screen) on which these words
appear: star dust.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, science has known of the importance of star dust in
the cosmic scheme of things, especially in matter more elaborate
than the simple elements made in the primordial Big Bang.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists have never had pure samples to study. Soon,
though, they will, if everything goes as planned.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
is to launch a probe meant to capture interplanetary and
interstellar dust in some of its rawest and purest forms, including
many thousands of grains from a comet. After a seven-year trek, the
craft is to return the samples to Earth, the first ever from beyond
the Moon.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately enough, the mission is dubbed Stardust.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to find out what this stuff is like,'' said Dr. Donald
C. Brownlee of the University of Washington, the chief scientist of
the mission. ``It's the building block of planets and human
bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alastair G.W. Cameron, an astrophysicist at Harvard
University, said scooping up star dust would greatly expand a field
that has recently undergone ``a revolution'' in understanding not
only how stars live and die but thrive in surprising diversity.
</P>
<P>
   The urge to investigate is driven by more than curiosity. Earth
sits in a cosmic shooting gallery, surrounded by speeding blocks of
ice and rock. The last time a really big one hit, 65 million years
ago, the tumult helped do in the dinosaurs, among other creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Today, scientists are seeking to learn more about comets and
other clumps of star dust in case earthlings might one day want to
divert one of the intruders, which can threaten more ruin than all
the world's nuclear arsenals combined.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Don Yeomans, a senior scientist at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., which manages the Stardust mission,
said it was only prudent to find such objects, learn their
structure and ``keep an eye upon their future trajectories.''
</P>
<P>
   Most intriguing of all, scientists hope a harvest of Stardust
data will yield clues to the origin of life on Earth, and perhaps
elsewhere. A rain of cosmic and cometary material is widely thought
to have brought early Earth not only water but the carbon-rich
molecules necessary for life.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some scientists believe the speeding mountains of dirty
ice known as comets may themselves support primitive life. While
highly speculative, such thinking has been bolstered ever so
slightly in recent years by the discovery of earthly microbes
dwelling in all manner of extreme environments from hot springs to
polar ices.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of cometary life is real enough that NASA asked
some of the nation's top biologists and other scientists to assess
whether the returning probe might inadvertently infect Earth with a
plague of microscopic aliens.
</P>
<P>
   That risk was ruled out. But scientists say there is a very slim
chance the craft will carry back dead extraterrestrials killed by
heat during capture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We concluded that the collection method would not allow any
organisms to live,'' said Dr. Clark R. Chapman, a senior scientist
at the Southwest Research Institute, based in San Antonio, and a
member of the review team. ``But they might come back mashed and
partly melted.''
</P>
<P>
   The backdrop for the mission was set some 12 billion to 16
billion years ago when repercussions of the cosmic explosion known
as the Big Bang filled the expanding universe with hydrogen and
helium, the simplest elements. They burned as stars flashed to
life.
</P>
<P>
   The starry furnaces in turn transformed the hydrogen and helium
into a variety of heavier elements, including carbon, nitrogen,
oxygen, silicon and iron.
</P>
<P>
   Such ashes were blown into space from parent stars by stellar
winds or blasted out by stellar explosions, the great heats of
which are thought to have made still heavier elements.
</P>
<P>
   Over generations of stars, a mix of gas and dust formed in
interstellar space that included grains of graphite (pure carbon),
silicon carbide (carbon and silicon) and water ice (hydrogen and
oxygen).
</P>
<P>
   The mix is thought to have gotten richer still as new stars lit
up nearby dust clouds with bursts of ultraviolet light, turning
simple atoms and molecules into more complex ones like methane,
methyl alcohol and dozens of other so-called organic compounds rich
in carbon.
</P>
<P>
   Such intricate dusts in turn formed new generations of stars,
perhaps accompanied by planets and icy comets not unlike those of
our own solar system, which is thought to have condensed out of a
dusty cloud some 4.6 billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Today, scientists know about this cosmic chemistry in part by
having peered with telescopes into the icy depths of space and
found the signatures of all kinds of simple and complex molecules.
Joni Mitchell, it seems, got it right in her song ``Woodstock''
when she sang, ``We are star dust.'' The celestial mix (much water,
many organic chemicals) matches that of the human body better than
Earth's general makeup does.
</P>
<P>
   In our solar system, most of the original cloud has vanished. It
was pulled into the Sun, blown into deep space or turned into
planets where internal heats and actions altered the materials
still further.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the original cloud survives, mainly in the form of
billions of comets. Other primal matter falls to Earth in the form
of rocky meteorites or as a steady rain of cosmic and cometary
dust.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   `That's the irony,'' said Brownlee of the University of
Washington, who pioneered catching such dust in high-flying jets.
``We have cometary particles all over us. Anybody who has been
outside today has a cometary particle on them. But you can't find
them or where they came from.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the uncertainty is that the particles are mixed
up amid earthly and celestial contamination and have often been
altered by heat upon hitting Earth's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its ambitious goals, Stardust is one of NASA's cheaper
space probes, costing $166 million. Contributing to the low price
is the recycling of spare parts from earlier craft like Voyager,
Galileo and Cassini.
</P>
<P>
   After launching from Florida, Stardust will head for deep space.
On approaching interstellar dust streams and the target comet,
known as Wild-2, it will deploy, on command from Earth, a particle
catcher shaped like a tennis racket.
</P>
<P>
   The catcher is covered on both sides with an extremely
low-density foam known as aerogel. This semitransparent material
will slow and stop particles without altering them too much. One
side will be used for the comet; the other for the interstellar
dust.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000 and 2002, the craft will gather dust in the regions
between Mars and Jupiter. Recently, other probes moving through
these areas have found a strong flow of particles from roughly the
direction of the constellation Sagittarius, toward which the Sun is
moving.
</P>
<P>
   In January 2004, Stardust is to encounter Wild-2 _ a glob of
dirty ice a few miles wide. It is considered an ideal target
because it only recently has been deflected by Jupiter's gravity
from a distant orbit into the inner solar system, so its outer
layers have undergone relatively little solar heating.
</P>
<P>
   Wild-2 now travels in a looping path from just outside Jupiter's
orbit to just inside that of Mars, where it makes its closest
approach to the Sun and reaches peak activity.
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft, 97 days after that peak, is to zoom past the
comet. The rendezvous site lies beyond the red planet. Still, the
Sun will be able to coax the ice ball into shedding dense swarms of
particles and vapors.
</P>
<P>
   At 13,600 miles per hour, the spacecraft is to swoop through the
comet's coma, the globular cloudlike mass that makes up the head,
passing within 100 or so miles of the core. It will capture dust
and photograph the nucleus. Particles will hit the dust catcher at
up to six times the speed of a bullet fired from a high-powered
rifle, NASA estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The craft's front end and solar panels are shielded with armor
plates to protect Stardust from the storm of icy particles.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say the particles will range from roughly 100 microns
(twice the width of a typical human hair) to less than a micron
(one-fiftieth of a human hair). A few, they judge, will be large
and a million or so, smaller than a micron.
</P>
<P>
   After the collecting is done, in January 2006, the craft's
32-inch-wide return pod is to descend by parachute toward the
United States Air Force Test and Training range in Utah. The
planned landing site is 100 or so miles southwest of Salt Lake City
in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   Then, scientists will begin analyzing its samples, working in
particular to establish as firm a baseline as possible for the
makeup of cosmic dust. ``It will give us ground truth,'' Brownlee
said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists also hope to address a number of mysteries in the
analysis of dust particles captured by jets and retrieved from
meteorites, especially odd ratios in them of rare isotopes, which
have the same chemical properties of parent elements but different
atomic weights.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, studies of the samples could illuminate the
evolutionary history of stars and establish a firm link between
interstellar dust, the state of the solar system's early cloud, the
nature of comets and the materials that today make up Earth and its
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   NASA discounts the possibility that any living alien creatures
will hitch a ride to Earth. ``Comets are extremely unlikely places
for life,'' Dr. John Rummel, the agency's planetary protection
officer, said at a recent press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, NASA had the National Academy of Sciences, the
congressionally chartered group of leading scientists that advises
the government, go over the mission plan carefully. A 10-member
panel appointed by the Academy's National Research Council
concluded in a report last year that cometary life was unlikely but
that ``the possibility cannot be completely ruled out.''
</P>
<P>
   In addressing the alien issue, Brownlee noted that though most
of the cosmic particles that fall naturally to Earth are heated,
some are not. Therefore, in theory, cometary life may already have
arrived on the planet long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nature,'' he noted, ``is always full of surprises.''

PERSONAL HEALTH: PERSUADING POTATOES TO GET OFF THE COUCHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)

 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Exercise _ you know you should be doing it, but something always
seems to keep you from getting started. You don't have time, the
weather's bad, there's no good place to work out, there's no one to
watch the kids, it disrupts your day, you're too tired or, perhaps
the most common and truthful excuse of them all, you hate to
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   You're not alone. More than 60 percent of Americans get little
or no exercise, despite repeated reminders about the myriad rewards
of regular physical activity to body and mind.
</P>
<P>
   But there's good news for you. According to two studies
published last week in the Journal of the American Medical
Association, you don't have to exercise in the traditional sense _
as in jogging, aerobics and cycling _ to glean many of the health
benefits of activity, including weight control. All you have to do
is incorporate more movement into your daily routines.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a plethora of diets, in the last three decades Americans
have become fatter and fatter even though national health surveys
indicate that we actually consume fewer calories than in years
past. Because body fat cannot appear out of thin air, the
explanation for our increasing weight must be that we are using
significantly fewer of the calories we consume.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't take much to figure out why. Just look around
you: television sets operated by remote control, motorized
vehicles, elevators and escalators, clothes and dish washers,
computers and fax machines, e-mail in the office, catalog and
Internet shopping, electric hedge clippers, chain saws, gas-powered
lawn mowers, leaf and snow blowers, and so forth and so on. One
hardly has to lift a finger to get through the day. And, to be
sure, most people don't.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven Blair, director of research and epidemiology at the
Cooper Institute of Aerobics Research in Dallas, quotes a Scottish
researcher's estimate that in the United Kingdom, average energy
expenditures have dropped by 800 calories a day in the last 25
years. If anything, the decline has been more precipitous on this
side of the Atlantic. Even if you used just 100 calories a day less
and ate the same amount, you would gain about 10 pounds a year,
nearly all of them as body fat unless you are physically active.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Haskell, an exercise expert at Stanford University,
has calculated that if you spend two minutes an hour of each
workday sending e-mail to office mates instead of walking down the
hall to talk to them, you would accumulate the caloric equivalent
of 11 pounds of body fat in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   And because body fat uses fewer calories than muscle to maintain
itself, your metabolic rate _ the number of calories you use up
minute by minute _ would drop and you would gain even more weight.
And thus we have the vicious cycle of inactivity and weight gain
that now plagues half the population.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than one-fifth of Americans engage in regular, sustained,
vigorous physical activity, the kind that causes them to sweat a
little, the kind that has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of
chronic diseases and early death.
</P>
<P>
   The proportion of Americans who engage in this kind of exercise
has not increased since the mid-1980s despite ever-mounting
evidence that such activity can greatly reduce the risk of
developing and dying of heart disease, stroke, diabetes,
hypertension and osteoporosis and reduce the functional losses that
accompany aging.
</P>
<P>
   This lack of progress in getting more Americans on the move
prompted leading health authorities a few years ago to modify their
exercise advice. Rather than pushing everyone to exercise at their
so-called target heart rate for at least 20 minutes at a time at
least three times a week, the American Heart Association, the
American College of Sports Medicine and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention took a more practical tack. They now suggest
that everyone do 30 minutes or more of moderately intense physical
activity on most, and preferably all, days of the week. They
further say that the 30 minutes of daily activity can be divided
into as many as three 10-minute segments.
</P>
<P>
   Possible choices include walking briskly all or part way to your
destination, walking the dog (or a neighbor's dog), raking leaves,
digging in the garden, swimming laps, riding an exercise bike,
playing with the kids in the park, polishing furniture, washing the
car, mopping the floor or sawing wood by hand. Additional calories
can be burned and the benefits of activity gained by walking up _
and down _ stairs, parking at the far end of the lot, carrying
groceries, even washing dishes and sweeping the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, among others, has pointed out that becoming more fit can
take 20 years off a person's chronological age. In an interview in
the current issue of Nutrition Action Health Letter, he noted that
``unfit people start to develop limitations 20 to 25 years earlier
than higher-fit people.''
</P>
<P>
   He also cited evidence that exercise improves sleep, the ability
to handle stress, the functioning of the immune system and mental
outlook. People who exercise regularly feel better and have more
energy, which would also contribute to a better sex life, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Blair is a co-author of one of the newly published studies,
directed by Dr. Andrea Dunn at the Cooper Institute. The study
involved 235 sedentary and slightly overweight men and women. Half
were randomly assigned to a six-month structured exercise program
in a gym and the other half were placed on a program involving
routine activities like walking instead of riding and taking stairs
instead of elevators. Two years later, both groups had about the
same improvements in heart function and blood pressure and, while
neither group lost weight, they both reduced their percentage of
body fat. At least one-fourth of the participants maintained an
improvement in cardiovascular fitness of 10 percent, which could
translate into a 15 percent reduction in mortality, Dr. Dunn and
his colleagues reported.
</P>
<P>
   The second study also examined the effects of structured aerobic
activity versus life-style activity, in this case among 40 obese
women who also were placed on a moderate weight-reduction diet. The
researchers, headed by Dr. Ross Anderson of Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine, found that both groups lost about
the same amount of weight, but that one year after completing the
16-week program, the life-style activity group had regained less.
In addition, the life-style program was as effective as aerobic
activity in improving weight, blood pressure and cholesterol
levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is good news for people who understand the role of
physical activity in weight control but dislike vigorous physical
activity or believe that they lack time to exercise,'' the
researchers concluded. ``Patients should strive to incorporate
regular physical activity into their lives on a daily basis but
should realize that even some physical activity, even if not
performed regularly, is much better than being sedentary.''

<P>
   Crammed into a small back room at the Koop Institute in Hanover,
N.H., are 13 computer screens, their processing units, a fish tank
and a group of Dartmouth College students angry about what they see
as the tobacco industry's efforts to hook children on smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Applying the advanced computer skills of the present-day
undergraduate, they are piecing together the slick digitized images
of Smoking Joe Moose, an evil character who is trying to take over
the world with the most addictive cigarette ever known.
</P>
<P>
   The students are producing an animated action film, a James Bond
parody for children, called, ``Tobacco Never Dies?''
</P>
<P>
   In a role as a behind-the-scenes foil to the moose is a
character who bears a striking resemblance to the former Surgeon
General, Dr. C. Everett Koop, the founder of the institute, who
raised the money to support it and operates it in alliance with the
Dartmouth Medical School. Koop works with help from an army of
student and faculty proteges and other professionals and volunteers
from the worlds of health, science and education.
</P>
<P>
   As surgeon general during the Reagan administration from 1981 to
1989, Koop was known as America's Doctor _ and it is clear from
recent evidence on his new Web site (drkoop.com) that a substantial
portion of the population still regards him that way.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 82, he directs his army with the animation, fire and
bluntness that seem to make him a formidable opponent for Moose and
the tobacco industry, and for a list of other forces he believes
threaten the nation's health.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry remains his chief foe and is constantly on
his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tobacco was on the ropes last summer _ 57 senators were lining
up for tough antismoking legislation,'' he says, ``and it was
pushed off the floor by a few politicians and lobbyists who cared
more about selling cigarettes than the health of the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   He is angry, too, that Time Inc., a subsidiary of Time-Warner,
citing poor sales, ended a joint venture to produce a series of
videos on causes and treatments of disease before he could make one
on the hazards of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Koop contends the cigarette industry is moving out in front
again in the tobacco wars. ``You now see groups of kids smoking on
college campuses all over the country, which you did not see only
two years ago,'' Koop said.
</P>
<P>
   But his list of other public health enemies is long. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   _ A health care system that leaves almost 50 million Americans
with no insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   _ The system's failings in the care it does provide, made worse
by the demands of managed care.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inadequate attention to people infected with the hepatitis C
virus.
</P>
<P>
   _ Increasing obesity, particularly among young Americans.
</P>
<P>
   _ The quality of teaching in medical schools.
</P>
<P>
   _ The high number of preventable accidental deaths among
children.
</P>
<P>
   That Koop was still a household name became evident in December,
when he hung out his shingle on the Internet. In less than a month,
the Web site has had two million visits, more than the sites of the
Mayo Clinic and Johns Hopkins Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Koop's site offers free medical and health information about
diseases, treatment and medication options and records of treatment
risk and success, or a place to create a permanent personal medical
history that subscribing hospitals and doctors can plug into.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen hospitals have paid about $100,000 each for a place on
the site _ far less, Koop says, than it would cost them to create
their own sites. He said he expected 15 more within a month. ``I've
gone commercial,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said, he was offered millions for endorsements when
his term as surgeon general ended. One company dangled $1 million
if he agreed to appear in a commercial holding a box of cereal.
``That,'' he said, ``I would not do.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his first business foray, in 1995, was the venture with
Time to produce the television videos in which he would appear and
explain the symptoms of diseases, the treatment options and
relative risks. Some critics said he was shifting from doctor to
entrepreneur. But Koop said such efforts were crucial to improving
public health.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Time withdrew from the video project in 1996 after
the first batch of 34 films was completed, citing disappointing
early sales.
</P>
<P>
   To Koop, his work on the videos and Empower Health Corp. of
Austin, Texas, the company he formed to run the Web site, help
encourage people to take charge of their health.
</P>
<P>
   This, he said, would ultimately ``empower them to rise up in
critical mass and demand a health care system that is more
responsive and effective for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Koop sought financial backers for the enterprise _ he said it
cost about $450,000 to create _ and is the corporate chairman. He
owns a small block of stock, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Trudging through the third snowfall of the week in Hanover, with
temperatures sinking to 19 degrees below zero, Koop said he slowed
down after he turned 80 two years ago. This is not readily
apparent. He is up at 6 a.m. and barely pauses for breath from then
on.
</P>
<P>
   The rounds this morning start the way one might think all
mornings should start for students, teachers and talkative doctors.
Koop sits at at polished wood conference table in a large seminar
room, whose 33-pane, 25-foot-high arched window overlooks the
snow-covered pines of Hanover, Koop speaks to 15 psychology
students.
</P>
<P>
   He is going to instruct them during the winter term in how to
prepare scientific papers for submission to professional journals.
The papers are based on research gathered by the Koop Institute's
Center for Educational Outcomes. Several papers from previous
seminars have found publishers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The center and this seminar grew out of a project that Koop
started, to evaluate his own work, almost immediately after
establishing the institute in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Though Koop was a respected pediatric surgeon and professor of
surgery and pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania before he
became Surgeon General at age 66, ``we wanted to make sure we were
actually accomplishing something'' at the project, Koop said.
</P>
<P>
   The center's director, Dr. G. Chris Jernsted, head of the
college's psychology department, said the first thing the center
did was read Koop's collected lectures, speeches and pronouncements
about what makes a good doctor. ``Six themes emerged,'' Jernsted
said.
</P>
<P>
   _ A doctor should use her or his experience in treating disease
to help prevent its recurrence.
</P>
<P>
   _ Doctors and patients must try to learn from each other.
</P>
<P>
   _ Treat the whole person, not a single complaint.
</P>
<P>
   _ Work as a member of a medical team, not as a star or lone
cowboy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Learn to listen and to talk so that you can be understood.
</P>
<P>
   _ Remain a generalist even if you are a specialist, remembering
that no medical specialty exists in isolation.
</P>
<P>
   The center traced about 2,000 first-year students at 15 medical
schools, presented them with the Koop theories and monitored their
performance and progress in mock interviews with actor patients.
</P>
<P>
   Their experiments proved successful enough in improving the
students' behavior that the center expanded the theories to
teaching and has done similar studies at public schools in
Michigan. It is the data from the Michigan research that Koop is
presenting to the psychology students to analyze and prepare for
publication.
</P>
<P>
   After class, Koop is taken by van to a parking lot about a half
mile away. As the van arrives, he is reminded of how rough a place
the campus once was for an undergraduate, and revealed how, as a
result, he later became a quadriplegic for 72 hours while he was
surgeon general.
</P>
<P>
   He broke his neck while ski jumping in an intramural competition
near this parking lot 64 years ago. The scars enlarged over the
years and eventually combined with arthritis to compress the spinal
cord and shut down part of his nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   He said people in the Department of Health and Human Services _
he called them political enemies _ started to rush out a press
release saying he had suffered a stroke and would never resume his
duties. ``A network of doctors quickly got the press release
squelched,'' he said. The paralysis began to eased within three
days and he then underwent surgery to prevent a recurrence.
</P>
<P>
   It was 66 years ago on a field where the parking lot is now, he
said, where a football injury gave him permanent double vision. As
a freshman, he was knocked out in practice, playing for Dartmouth's
legendary coach Earl Blaik. The campus doctor said he had suffered
a serious eye injury, though it was correctable with glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife,'' he said, ``always threatened to tell my surgical
patients that I see double.''
</P>
<P>
   He said another such blow could be fatal or cause blindness so
he told the coach he would have to quit football and the ``great
man said: `Good, we don't want cowards on this team.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Another of his major concerns in public health is managed care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solution to the problem of inadequate care in this
country,'' he said, ``is going to come when people have been
persuaded to take charge of their health, to educate themselves on
what may be involved if they become sick, to learn the options
available to them, to learn what can be done to stay healthy, to
understand what they can of their medical history. By the year
2002, when the number of people without health insurance increases
from the 50 million at present to 60 million, a critical mass of
people is going to rise up and demand that some kind of national
system be put in place to correct this.''
</P>
<P>
   Koop talks often about the subject with the medical school dean,
Dr. John C. Baldwin. The dean holds much the same views and
recently proposed setting up what he would call the Dartmouth
Community Medical School, an electronic school on the Internet
where people in New Hampshire could tap into teachings and research
going on at the medical school and in medicine in general and, in
effect, take not-for-credit courses in areas that may directly
affect their health or the health of their families or simply
better educate them to public health needs. ``Why New Hampshire?''
Koop asked. ``Why not make it worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   He has proposed that the medical school sign on to drkoop.com so
that anyone on the World Wide Web might have the same benefit.
Baldwin said the proposal is in a preliminary but serious stage of
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   While these issues and wars are being explored and waged in the
foreground, the young Dartmouth animators are sinking Smoking Joe
Moose and his henchmen off the China coast, along with their cargo
of superaddictive tobacco, through the work of Nick Free, also
known as Triple-O-Seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saved the world from the evils of smoking,'' says Free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get too excited, Free,'' says his beautiful sidekick, Wu
Yan. ``Our job's only just begun.''

IN PURSUIT OF AFFLUENCE, AT A HIGH PRICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(JT) 
 By ALFIE KOHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The adage that money cannot buy happiness may be familiar, but
is easily forgotten in a consumer society. A much more persistent
and seductive message is beamed from every television screen:
Contentment is available for the price of this car, that computer,
a little more getting and spending.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, however, psychological researchers have
been amassing an impressive body of data suggesting that
satisfaction simply is not for sale. Not only does having more
things prove to be unfulfilling, but people for whom affluence is a
priority in life tend to experience an unusual degree of anxiety
and depression as well as a lower overall level of well-being.
Likewise, those who would like nothing more than to be famous or
attractive do not fare as well, psychologically speaking, as those
who primarily want to develop close relationships, become more
self-aware, or contribute to the community.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier research had demonstrated that neither income nor
attractiveness was strongly correlated with a sense of well-being.
But Dr. Richard Ryan, professor of psychology at the University of
Rochester, and Dr. Tim Kasser, a former student who is now an
assistant professor of psychology at Knox College in Illinois, have
discovered that the news is even worse.
</P>
<P>
   In three sets of studies published in leading psychology
journals since 1993, with a new article expected later this year in
Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin and still more papers on
the way, the researchers sketch an increasingly bleak portrait of
people who value ``extrinsic goals'' like money, fame and beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Such people are not only more depressed than others, but also
report more behavioral problems and physical discomfort, as well as
scoring lower on measures of vitality and self-actualization. While
not every study has investigated the full list of effects, the
pattern that emerges from the research project as a whole is
remarkably consistent.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan and Kasser said their studies provided a look at the ``dark
side of the American dream,'' noting that the culture in some ways
seemed to be built on precisely what turned out to be detrimental
to mental health. Americans are encouraged to try to strike it
rich, but, ``the more we seek satisfactions in material goods, the
less we find them there,'' Ryan said. ``The satisfaction has a
short half-life; it's very fleeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the detrimental effect of extrinsic goals seems to
hold regardless of age or even level of income: A preoccupation
with money bodes ill regardless of how much money one already has.
The effects also appear not to be limited to any one culture.
Kasser and his associates have now collected data from subjects in
13 countries, including Germany, Russia and India. The fact that
pursuing wealth is psychologically unhelpful and often destructive,
he reports, ``comes through very strongly in every culture I've
looked at.''
</P>
<P>
   Affluence, per se, does not necessarily result in an
unsatisfying life. Problems are primarily associated with ``living
a life where that's your focus,'' Ryan said. Nevertheless, the
negative psychological picture does seem to be associated with the
extent to which people believe they are already on the way to
attaining extrinsic goals. For example, the paper to be published
this year surveyed about 300 youths, some in the United States and
some in Russia. In both countries, lower levels of mental health
were found not only in people who wanted to make a lot of money but
also in those who thought they were likely to succeed at it.
</P>
<P>
   Another study by the same researchers, not yet accepted for
publication, found that college students who were already
``relatively high in the attainment of appearance, financial
success and popularity'' were nevertheless ``lower in well-being
and self-esteem.'' Those who aspired to affluence also had more
transient relationships, watched more television and were more
likely to use cigarettes, alcohol and other drugs than were those
who placed less emphasis on extrinsic goals.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from its obvious implications for a culture that thrives
on material gain, this whole line of research raises questions
about the proclivity of some psychologists to analyze the dynamics
of what is often called goal-directed behavior while, in effect,
ignoring the nature of the goal. Likewise, it challenges homespun
advice to ``follow one's dream,'' whatever it may be.
</P>
<P>
   These data strongly suggest that not all goals or dreams are
created equal. According to the researchers, pursuing goals that
reflect genuine human needs, like wanting to feel connected to
others, turns out to be more psychologically beneficial than
spending one's life trying to impress others or to accumulate
trendy clothes, fancy gizmos and the money to keep buying them.
</P>
<P>
   The latter quest may amount to using compensation to try to
compensate for something more meaningful. The empirical support for
this piece of the puzzle comes from a particularly provocative
study that Kasser and Ryan conducted with Dr. Melvin Zax at the
University of Rochester and Dr. Arnold Sameroff at the University
of Michigan. These researchers discovered that 18-year-olds for
whom financial success was especially important turned out to be
disproportionately likely to have mothers who were not very
nurturing. When parents are ``cold and controlling,'' the
researchers wrote, ``their children apparently focus on attaining
security and a sense of worth through external sources.''
</P>
<P>
   This seems consistent with anecdotal accounts of very wealthy
men who grew up in troubled homes. Such stories are sometimes cited
as evidence that they made the best of a bad thing, turning out
well despite or because of their unhappy childhoods. The problem
with this interpretation, according to the research, is that they
may not have turned out so well after all. They just turned out
wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   It is not entirely clear why a poor psychological profile would
go hand-in-hand with a quest for extrinsic goals. It may be that
unhappy people are more likely than others to chase after money and
fame. Conversely, the very act of chasing after money and fame may
reduce one's sense of well-being, perhaps because ``it makes you
ignore the goals that could lead you to have more satisfying
experiences,'' Kasser speculated. Yet a third possibility is that
extrinsic goals and poorer psychological health are symptoms of
something else that is amiss.

AN ERA OF NEW HOPE FOR AIDS SUFFERERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
SURVIVING AIDS 
Written, produced and directed by: Betsey Arledge 
Narrated by: Edward Hermann 
On: PBS, 8 p.m. Tuesday 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During a 1994 Massachusetts gubernatorial contest that was not
exactly a nail-biter, the most compelling storyline involved the
Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, a little-known
Episcopal priest from Somerville named Robert Massie.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard not to be impressed by this political novice who,
despite his HIV infection, was the picture of robust good health as
he trekked the state or tangled with his GOP counterpart, Paul
Cellucci, in two spirited debates.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital were more than
impressed by Massie's virtually unheard-of natural resistance to
AIDS. As a NOVA production called ``Surviving AIDS'' describes in
absorbing detail, they were inspired by Massie to undertake a new
approach to fighting AIDS, one that may hold the promise of a
weapon against an epidemic that has killed 500,000 Americans and 11
million people worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surviving AIDS'' offers the satisfactions of a high-stakes
scientific mystery yarn along with glimpses into the lives of
Massie; Steve Crohn, another man who also has a natural immunity to
HIV; John Ceravsky of Boston, a patient who courageously agreed to
stop taking anti-HIV drugs as part of an experiment at Mass.
General; and a pair of young twins infected with HIV but kept
healthy by anti-AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they form the basis for what NOVA persuasively calls
``this era of new hope.''
</P>
<P>
   It all began with Massie, a hemophiliac who contracted HIV from
a contaminated blood product in 1978, six years before AIDS came to
public attention.
</P>
<P>
   In some mysterious fashion, Massie's immune system constructed a
defense against HIV; rather than being destroyed as is usually the
case after HIV infection, the ``T cells'' that facilitate the
body's immunity stayed healthy. ``We were all amazed,'' says
researcher Dr. Eric Rosenberg. ``We thought that people who were
HIV-infected weren't able to mount this kind of immune response.
And here was someone who clearly did, and did it in a way we never
saw before.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Massie has remained free of AIDS symptoms and has
become one of the longest-surviving people infected with HIV. He
ruefully admits that he wonders whether he will be better-known as
experiment subject 161-J rather than for his writing or other
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Could well be. According to NOVA, studies of Massie by an MGH
team including Rosenberg and Dr. Bruce Walker have yielded new
experimental approaches to combating AIDS, such as intervening with
anti-viral drugs early in the disease to help shore up the immune
system against attacks by the HIV virus.
</P>
<P>
   In the most throat-catching sequence of ``Surviving AIDS,'' we
see two beneficiaries of such treatments, 3-year-old twins Caroline
and Jeffrey, who were only expected to live a couple of years after
they contracted HIV from their mother. But they began receiving
anti-AIDS drugs, the youngest patients ever to receive them. Their
adoptive parents, a selfless and loving pair who remind us of the
quiet heroism exhibited by so many friends and relatives of AIDS
patients, gave them the medication at regular intervals around the
clock.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the toddlers' immune systems have returned to normal and
they are, for now, healthy, though the HIV lingers in their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Two of NOVA's strengths, clarity and context, fuse as
``Surviving AIDS'' makes clear how vital the Massie-inspired
approaches to controlling AIDS are, because devising a vaccine for
the disease has proven more difficult than expected, and may be
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   But in a hype-free and reasoned manner, NOVA suggests while an
AIDS-free world might not be attainable, it is nonetheless
reasonable to hope that every AIDS patient can become ``a long-term
survivor.'' A closing shot of Bob Massie smiling at his baby
daughter underscores how fine a world that would be.

BIRD LOVERS SEE PROMISE IN STRUGGLE TO SAVE CONDORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LANCE WILLIAMS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARBLE PEAK RANCH, Calif. _ On a foggy, windswept mountain 2,500
feet above the Big Sur coast, seven of the rarest birds on the
planet took tentative flight Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly an hour after a net dropped away on a big wire enclosure,
the first of the birds _ a 10-month-old male known, prosaically, as
No. 94 _ hopped onto the rocky ridge and then, awkwardly, flew a
few dozen yards down the ridge. Later, he tried again. Soon, he was
making a series of tight, soaring flights over a rock-strewn
canyon, joined by another bird, then another.
</P>
<P>
   ``There they go!'' said naturalist Kelly Sorenson, watching from
a nearby ridge.
</P>
<P>
   The birds were California condors _ huge black scavengers with
wingspans of 9 feet and the ability to fly 300 miles in a single
day in search of carrion.
</P>
<P>
   Shot, poisoned and electrocuted to the very brink of extinction,
the condors in the 1980s became the subject of a high-risk recovery
program. The remaining 22 condors were trapped and taken to zoos.
There, according to the plan, they would be safe to breed, and
their progeny would later be returned to the wild.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists and environmentalists predicted cataclysmic
failure, saying the plan would simply guarantee the condor's
extinction. But advocates say that events like Saturday's _ in
which seven zoo-bred condors were released into the rugged Ventana
Wilderness _ show the program is working.
</P>
<P>
   The release brings to 56 the number of condors now in the wild
in California and Arizona, said Sal Lucido, president of the
Ventana Wilderness Society, the nonprofit group that released the
birds in partnership with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
Another 100 are in zoos.
</P>
<P>
   The program has emphasized preventing the condors from having
contact with humans, and it also has made sure that all the birds
spend time with an adult condor before release _ a so-called mentor
bird that serves as a surrogate parent.
</P>
<P>
   After about nine months, condors are ready for release. The
birds set free Saturday were first put in an enclosure on the
ridgetop here in December to acclimate. When the day of release
approached, a stillborn calf was left on the hillside _ a first
meal. Then, as a group of about 100 bird lovers and
environmentalists watched from about a mile away, the enclosure was
opened.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Burnett, a field supervisor watching through one-way glass,
said the birds made no move to leave at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the other birds seem to be waiting to see what 90's going
to do _ it's kind of funny,'' he said on a two-way radio. But
finally, one after another, the birds took off.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists fastened tiny transmitters to the wings of the
condors to monitor them. They'll also continue to leave food out
for the birds. The seven that flew off Saturday join seven condors
released one year ago. All those birds are doing well, roosting in
a redwood grove near the Big Sur Lodge in Monterey County.
</P>
<P>
   The next big test for the recovery program will come when the
birds reach adulthood. If they successfully reproduce in the wild,
scientists will be able to proclaim the recovery program a success.
</P>
<P>
   But Art Palmer, of the Earth Island Institute, injects a note of
caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the question is what is going to happen to these birds
long-term, given that most of the problems that caused the collapse
of the condor are still prevalent,'' he said. ``There's still
development of condor habitat, and wind farms and high-tension
wires, and people with guns.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Ventana group's work has made Lloyd Kiff, science
director for the Peregrine Fund, an Idaho nonprofit organization
that also breeds condors, less pessimistic about the condor's
chances in California.
</P>
<P>
   On the Central Coast, ``the birds still have a lot of space to
move around,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``And if people
will refrain from shooting them, there's no reason they can't
survive.''

</P>
<P>
   The creatures that are the focus of the unusual $1
million-per-year rescue program are the largest birds in North
America that can manage flight and one of the oldest species on the
continent.
</P>
<P>
   From a distance, condors are magnificent creatures. Their
plumage is black with white trim. Their wings can span as much as
11 feet from tip to tip.
</P>
<P>
   Condors have been observed flying more than a mile high, and to
range more than 350 miles from their nests. The adult birds have
bare, reddish-orange heads and necks and keen red eyes that, during
flight, constantly scan the ground for food.
</P>
<P>
   Graceful in flight, the birds are ungainly on the ground,
especially after a full meal: Condors have been observed to have
difficulty getting airborne after gorging on a dead animal.

NEW NITROGEN ION CARRIES WARNING: HANDLE WITH CARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a century, chemists doubted that such a substance could
exist, but scientists at an Air Force laboratory have created a
freakish form of nitrogen believed to be one of the most violently
explosive substances ever made.
</P>
<P>
   To the acclaim of many other scientists, a team of chemists
headed by Drs. Karl O. Christe and William W. Wilson at the Air
Force Research Laboratory at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.,
reported their achievement at a recent meeting of the American
Chemical Society.
</P>
<P>
   The new compound is a positively charged ion, or molecular
fragment, consisting of five nitrogen atoms chemically bonded to
each other in a V pattern. It is so sensitive and explosive, the
magazine Chemical &AMP; Engineering News reported, that a few tiny
grains of the substance accidentally detonated, destroying part of
the apparatus being used to analyze it.
</P>
<P>
   The newly synthesized allotrope, or form, of nitrogen (N5 ) is
only the third such form of the element ever discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Nitrogen in its most common, gaseous form, consisting of two
atoms of the element chemically bound to each other (N2 ), makes up
four fifths of the earth's atmosphere and is quite stable and
chemically unreactive. This form of nitrogen was identified in
1772.
</P>
<P>
   The next allotrope of nitrogen to be discovered was the azide
ion (N3), containing three bound nitrogen atoms, which was
synthesized in 1890. Azides combined with metals as salts are
unstable and explosive; lead azide, for example, has been used
commercially to detonate high explosives, and sodium azide is the
explosive used to inflate automobile air bags.
</P>
<P>
   To bind chemically the increasing numbers of nitrogen atoms to
one another requires enormous energy, and chemical theorists had
predicted that nitrogen allotropes with more than three nitrogen
atoms would be so unstable they could not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Christe's team, however, has confounded the experts.
</P>
<P>
   Over four months, his group succeeded in synthesizing a salt in
which the positive ion consists of five nitrogen atoms and the
negative ion consists of an arsenic atom with six fluorine atoms.
The group obtained proof of the substance's chemical composition
using laser spectroscopy, but after the analysis was completed,
several grains of the white crystalline powder exploded,
demolishing the sample chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The material is so dangerous to handle that only a handful of
laboratories would be able to perform Dr. Christe's synthesis,
chemists said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven H. Strauss of Colorado State University at Fort
Collins, who is familiar with Dr. Christe's work, said in an
interview that even the most experienced chemists regard the
synthesis of an allotrope with five nitrogen atoms as astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just having shown that this substance can exist even
temporarily is a gigantic achievement,'' he said. ``Theorists who
may have considered this type of compound impossible will have to
do some recalculating.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Christe is known for another tour de force in chemistry: the
first successful separation, in 1986, of pure fluorine from a
fluorine compound using chemical reactions alone. Fluorine, a
poisonous pale yellow gas, is normally prepared by passing a
current of electricity through molten fluoride salts. Fluorine is
the most violently reactive of all elements, and it can be
separated from its compounds only with the help of large amounts of
energy. Most chemists had believed that chemical separation of
elemental fluorine was probably impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Christe works at the propulsion division of the Air Force
laboratory at Edwards, and his research, some of it secret, is
financed by the Air Force, the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency and the National Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   He said in an interview that the new nitrogen allotrope was
likely to find uses, but he declined to say what they would be.
However, the material is such a powerful oxidizing agent that it
explosively rips water molecules apart.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Christe said that the latest goal of his group was to
synthesize an all-nitrogen salt consisting of a positive ion of
five nitrogen atoms bound to a negative ion of five nitrogen atoms.
Such a compound, containing 10 mutually linked nitrogen atoms,
would be extremely difficult if not impossible to synthesize, but
it would probably pack stupendous chemical energy that might be
released with great explosive force.

ETHER RE-EMERGES AS THE JE NE SAIS QUOI OF PHYSICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J., Wash., Calif.)   (af)  
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one can see it, hear it, smell it or touch it, and yet people
seem to have sensed its existence for nearly as long as there have
been written languages.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three centuries ago Aristotle inferred its existence by
proclaiming that nature abhors a vacuum. In ancient Rome, the
Stoics believed in a universal medium they called the ``pneuma.''
In medieval times, thinkers called it the ``plenum,'' and later, it
went under the name ``ether.''
</P>
<P>
   This ethereal stuff, in somewhat modified form, survived even
the investigations of modern science, even though it seemed for
many years that Einstein had consigned ether to the trash heap of
obsolete notions. In its latest incarnation, ether has become a
universal web of ``quantum fields.''
</P>
<P>
   This stuff is hard to define, but it is what you have when there
is nothing else. Theorists spend a lot of effort thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century, with the realization that light travels in
waves, many scientists believed that there had to be some universal
medium, the equivalent of an ocean of water, through which light
waves could travel even in the vacuum of space. This implied that
something _ the ether _ pervaded every nook and cranny of the
universe, including the empty space within atoms and between
galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   But the 19th century version of ether was flawed.
</P>
<P>
   As the Earth moves through the universal ether, it was reasoned,
there should be a detectable difference between the speed of a
light beam aligned with the Earth's direction of motion and that of
a perpendicular beam, just as the speed of a swimmer on a river
depends on whether he is swimming with, against or across the
current.
</P>
<P>
   But a landmark experiment in 1887 by two Americans, Albert A.
Michelson and Edward W. Morley, failed to find any difference in
the speed of light caused by differences in direction through the
ocean of ether.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1905 came relativity theory and an entirely new way to
look at space. With the birth of relativity theory it became clear
that there was no need for ether as a propagating medium for light
waves; space-time itself _ the four-dimensional framework of the
universe postulated by relativity _ was the tableau across which
all physical effects could play, including the transmission of
light.
</P>
<P>
   The ether theory fell into disfavor with the advent of
Einstein's theory of relativity, and although ether survived as a
word, its connotation as a universal standard against which
absolute motion could be detected had to be abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   But in the current issue of Physics Today, Dr. Frank Wilczek of
the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., writes that
the ether has undeservedly been given a bad name, when in fact, it
should be regarded as the direct ancestor of quantum fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a logical succession,'' Wilczek said in an interview.
``Modern quantum field theory is a direct descendant of the
ether.''
</P>
<P>
   In his article, he wrote that ``there is a myth, repeated in
many popular presentations and textbooks, that Albert Einstein
swept the ether into the dustbin of history.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Wilczek wrote, the ether, ``renamed and thinly
disguised, dominates the accepted laws of physics.''
</P>
<P>
   In this view of things, intangible quantum fields fill
everything in the universe, including the voids inside atoms and
the immense space between galaxies. Every conceivable type of
particle capable of existence has its own universal field extending
throughout the universe, and when any point in the field is
``excited'' _ tweaked with energy _ it creates the field's
associated particle, say, an electron or a quark.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Cosmic Code,'' the late Dr. Heinz R. Pagels wrote that
the universe could be likened to a superposition of gigantic bed
springs, each one corresponding to a particular type of particle.
In places where the ``bed springs'' _ or fields _ are strong,
particles of matter materialize.
</P>
<P>
   In Pagels' analogy, a quark bed spring and an electron bed
spring, although intermixed, do not interact directly with each
other. But both can interact with a third field _ say, an
electromagnetic field _ and all the associated particles of the
three fields are thus interconnected. Similar mechanisms presumably
connect all the other universal fields, many of which have yet to
be discovered, perhaps with the help of powerful new particle
accelerators.
</P>
<P>
   Pagels was a hard-headed physicist and no mystic, but some
nonscientists have seen in quantum field theory an updated version
of pantheism, which postulates the presence of a deity in all
things.
</P>
<P>
   But shorn of theological associations, the flourishing of 20th
century physics based on quantum electrodynamics has shown that
even the vacuum of space, utterly devoid of matter or conventional
forms of energy, actually seethes with activity.
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of simplicity many physicists would like to believe
that the overall total energy of the universe is zero. But even if
this is so, there are constant brief and very tiny fluctuations
that permit the fleeting existence of virtual particles of all
kinds. If in some way a virtual particle can acquire energy from
some outside source it becomes a real particle; otherwise, it
swiftly disappears.
</P>
<P>
   This view of things is not only a logical consequence of quantum
electrodynamics; it has been demonstrated by many phenomena and
experiments. One experiment, easily understood even by
nonscientists, was first performed three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Among the components of the modern-day ether _ or, as most
physicists prefer to call it, the vacuum _ are virtual waves. In
1948, a Dutch physicist, Hendrick B.G. Casimir, predicted that a
pair of metal plates held very close together in a vacuum would
exclude any virtual waves with wavelengths longer than the width of
the gap between the plates. There being fewer waves between the
plates than in the normal vacuum environment outside the plates, a
small force from the outside should push the plates together.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly half a century no one got around to testing this
prediction, although physicists considered the outcome a foregone
conclusion. But in 1996, Dr. Steve K. Lamoreaux, then at the
University of Washington in Seattle built an exquisitely sensitive
apparatus containing two Casimir plates and a balance, and
performed the difficult experiment. The attractive force he
measured between the plates was within 5 percent of the force
predicted by quantum electrodynamic theory _ a tremendous success.
</P>
<P>
   In November, two other physicists, Dr. Umar Mohideen and Dr.
Anushree Roy at the University of California at Riverside performed
a more refined version of the plate experiment, for which their
result was within 1 percent of the value predicted by theory.
</P>
<P>
   Other pieces of evidence for a universal vacuum packed full of
unseen ether _ or whatever it should be called _ have come from the
cosmos. Astrophysicists have long known that there is far too
little ``visible matter'' _ matter that can be detected directly _
to account for the powerful gravitation of galaxies, galactic
clusters and other large-scale bodies. The nature of the
gravitating substance is unknown, but one thing is clear: ``Empty''
space is anything but empty; the ether lives on.

NEW AMPHETAMINE THERAPY HELPS SOME STROKE PATIENTS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By SANDRA BLAKESLEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doctors have found a bold new way of helping people who have had
strokes recover the ability to talk and move their limbs in the
first weeks and months after brain injury. Patients are given low
doses of amphetamine, the common stimulant, along with intense
physical therapy, a combination that appears to accelerate recovery
in many people.
</P>
<P>
   But, doctors caution, the treatment is experimental and may not
be appropriate for all stroke victims, especially elderly people
with heart disease or other serious ailments. Nevertheless, it is
the first effective treatment ever found for helping people recover
function after the acute phase of a stroke has passed.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke in
Bethesda, Md., is conducting a clinical trial of the method to see
if it should be widely recommended for stroke patients. ``We are
doing everything we can to encourage research in this area,'' said
Dr. John Marler, acting director of the division of experimental
therapeutics and clinical trials at the institute.
</P>
<P>
   There are three ways to combat strokes, Marler said. One is to
prevent them by helping people reduce their risk factors. Second is
to treat the injury within three hours using drugs, known as clot
busters, that can restore blood flow and help stave off brain
damage. But, he said, the majority of stroke victims wait many
hours or even days before going to a hospital and by that time, it
is too late to use clot busters. The third chance to intervene is
days or weeks after the stroke occurs and this, he said, has been
the most neglected area of stroke research.
</P>
<P>
   People used to wait to see what happened next, said Dr. Leonardo
Cohen, a neurologist at the institute who is running the new
clinical trial. ``But the idea that you cannot do anything in this
period has shifted dramatically'' with new findings from basic
neuroscience research, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The adult brain is ``plastic,'' meaning it can make new
connections rapidly and can repair itself. Stroke doctors are
learning how to nudge this process along, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph Broderick, a professor of neurology at the University
of Cincinnati Medical Center, estimates that each year 730,000
Americans suffer strokes, when blood flow in the brain is suddenly
blocked or an artery ruptures. Half of these patients end up with
some degree of permanent damage. Recent efforts to develop
so-called neuroprotective drugs to use during the acute phase of
stroke have not panned out, giving doctors more reason to look at
the post-injury period.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dennis Feeney, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at
the University of New Mexico at Albuquerque, began by looking at
animals. He discovered that rats with brain injuries similar to
stroke could walk 24 hours after receiving a single dose of
amphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like exactly the wrong thing to do,'' Feeney said.
``Giving speed to a stroke patient, you'd think it would kill
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The basic notion was very radical, like pouring gasoline on a
fire. But it makes sense, he said, given what happens to brain
cells during and after a stroke. Many neurons in the damaged region
are temporarily stunned rather than killed. They may have been
hooked up to cells that are now dead and messages are no longer
coming in, as if the phone line has been cut. Such cells do not
know what to do, so they sit confused, waiting for instructions,
Feeney said. Eventually some of them die but others find ways to
make new hookups and start functioning, which is the basis of
spontaneous recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these stunned cells are near the site of the stroke
itself, but others lie far away in other brain regions, Feeney
said. These depressed neurons are a bit like a fire gone to embers.
Sprinkling them with gasoline might actually help.
</P>
<P>
   Feeney and others have shown that amphetamine works by causing
the brain to release a substance called noradrenaline throughout
the brain. Noradrenaline is a so-called modulator that makes cells
wake up and attend to things that are interesting, Feeney said. It
makes brain cells more responsive and is involved in learning and
memory. Other drugs, including the stimulant called Ritalin, also
release noradrenaline and have been used for stroke therapy. Drugs
that decrease noradrenaline will slow or prevent stroke recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Amphetamine may promote the growth of new nerve connections and
protein synthesis, said Dr. Larry Goldstein, director of the stroke
center at Duke University in Durham, N.C. It is why some students
take amphetamine when cramming for tests. The drugs may influence
learning as well as keep a person awake.
</P>
<P>
   Feeney also found that animals had to be free to move around
naturally when they got the amphetamine. If prevented from moving,
they did not improve. Physical activity and the drug are
interactive, he said. Dosage and timing are also important. Too
much amphetamine harms animals and too little does no good. Feeney
also learned to wait for the injury to stabilize before giving
amphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Feeney discovered the amphetamine link in 1981. By the late
1980's, the results of three human clinical trials by various
groups were published. As in the animal experiments, people got
better when the drug was paired closely with physical therapy
within a month of the stroke. But if the amphetamine was given a
couple of months after the stroke or without physical therapy,
there seemed to be no benefit.
</P>
<P>
   At the Aphasia Center of Texas Woman's University and the
University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas, Dr.
Delaina Walker Batson has studied 57 stroke patients, 26 of whom
have received amphetamine plus physical therapy. Treatment begins
10 to 40 days after the stroke, Dr. Batson said. Patients are given
10 milligrams of drug every four days. There is no evidence of
increased blood pressure or heart rate, she said, even in severely
injured patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We give the drug and look at our watches,'' Dr. Batson said.
``We wait 30 minutes and start therapy, pushing the patients until
they can no longer do what we ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Batson said she was inspired by neuroscience research
showing that after injury a territory of cells sits ready and
waiting to be reorganized. Whatever behavior gets there first is
established, she said. ``This means that in giving speech therapy,
we don't give them simple word naming,'' Dr. Batson said. ``We push
them to use full phrases. We set high goals for a high level of
recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   It works, Dr. Batson said. Treated patients achieve in six weeks
what usually takes six months to achieve. Patients taking dummy
pills tend to reach a plateau after a few months of physical
therapy. A year later, long after both groups are not taking pills,
the patients who took amphetamine are far ahead of those who did
not. ``This is not a panacea,'' Dr. Batson said. ``These people
have very large lesions with profound motor and language deficits.
But they can go home and live a life and even take dancing lessons.
They may still have a little trouble being understood, but they are
not in nursing homes.''
</P>
<P>
   The treatment has worked well in a handful of people, but there
are good reasons why the therapy is not used more widely, Goldstein
said. First, doctors are conservative and do not want to harm
fragile, sick patients, he said. The risks are not yet known.
Second, amphetamine has a terrible reputation as an addictive drug.
Doctors are loath to use it on anyone. Third, amphetamine is an
old, inexpensive drug that cannot be patented. Pharmaceutical
companies have no incentive to run expensive clinical trials to
test it in stroke patients.
</P>
<P>
   Feeney says that just because the therapy's mechanism is not
completely known is no reason not to use it. Until recently
scientists did not know how aspirin worked, he said. Stroke
researchers are looking for magic bullets that manipulate one tiny
part of brain based on elegant theories, he said, ``but maybe you
need a sloppy drug like amphetamine that releases neurotransmitters
all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After all,'' he said, ``to move your little finger, you have
to use every neurotransmitter in your brain.''

GUINEA PIG IDENTITY CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By C. CLAIBORNE RAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Are guinea pigs rodents?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. Probably, based on structural features and fossil evidence,
though some scientists studying DNA evidence suspect otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Novacek, senior vice president and provost of the
American Museum of Natural History and curator of vertebrate
paleontology, said that there were studies, primarily of
mitochondrial genes, suggesting that guinea pigs might not be
rodents, but might belong to their own separate order.
</P>
<P>
   (Mitochondrial DNA is carried by the structures in cells that
act as cellular power plants. It is inherited in a different manner
than ordinary DNA is.)
</P>
<P>
   However, Novacek said, most of these studies were based on a
limited sample of genes in a limited number of orders. To get a
better answer, he said, far more gene sequences should be studied
for more mammals.
</P>
<P>
   He added that recent analysis also showed that by using the same
data as some of these studies, but employing another commonly
accepted model of gene evolution, guinea pigs can be placed in the
rodent group.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he said, the traditional kind of evidence in mammal
evolution is very strong that guinea pigs belong in the order
Rodentia, both from morphology (structural features like the head
and and the development of the gnawing teeth) and from paleontology
(fossils from Central Asia).

<P>
   The National Capital YMCA Service Center in downtown Washington
is a far cry from the Y's of old. It boasts two spacious fitness
centers, offers little in the way of community services and does
not allow children on weekdays. Members can also choose between a
basic membership and the more glitzy athletic membership, which
gives customers access to a second gym, laundry service and sauna.
</P>
<P>
   These facts are the essence of a long-standing feud between
nonprofit organizations and commercial health clubs.
</P>
<P>
   For years, private health club owners have complained that
YMCAs, community centers, hospitals and other not-for-profit
organizations can open fitness centers and pay no taxes on them
while competing directly and unfairly with health clubs that pay
taxes. Health clubs, they say, are the only businesses forced to
pay taxes to support their competitors. They also say that
nonprofit organizations have strayed from their original mission of
community outreach and have begun courting affluent adults who may
otherwise become dues-paying members of their clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Y in Washington is symbolic of a nonprofit endeavor that
has lost its way,'' said John McCarthy, executive director of the
International Health Racquet Sportsclub Association, a trade
organization for health clubs. ``It is parading as a public charity
but doesn't deserve that label.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Maier, director of association advancement for the YMCA in
the United States, said that nonprofit organizations running
fitness centers are being wrongfully criticized. ``Our mission
statement is clear: We put Christian principles into practice
through programs that build healthy spirit, mind and body for
all,'' he said. ``Some of our critics try to isolate one aspect of
our mission and say it doesn't belong. But it is all intertwined,
and fitness is an important part.''
</P>
<P>
   Debby Hirshman, executive director of the Jewish Community
Center on Manhattan's Upper West Side, agrees. ``We use our tax
savings as a way to make our facility affordable and
nonexclusive,'' said Ms. Hirshman, whose group is building a new
50,000-square-foot center, to open next year, complete with an
exercise area, Olympic-sized swimming pool and gymnasium.
Memberships are expected to cost $927 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The battle recently moved into the courtroom. Last month, a YMCA
in Secane, Pa., near Philadelphia, opened a ``wellness center,''
despite protests from local health club owners. The Sports Club in
Woodlyn, just a few miles from the new building, ultimately filed a
complaint _ the first of its kind _ with the state claiming that
the new Ridley Area YMCA violated Pennsylvania's Act 55, the
Institutions of Purely Public Charity Act, which declassifies the
``promotion of health'' as a charitable act and states that a
charity cannot compete directly with a small business by offering
overlapping services.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no need for this Y to be built because there are
already 14 fitness centers within three miles of it,'' said David
Cohan, owner of the Woodlyn club. Cohan claims that several smaller
clubs have already gone out of business as a direct result of the
Y's opening. ``They offer the same things we do while enjoying a
mind-boggling laundry list of tax advantages.'' Membership at the
Sports Club costs $627 per year, compared with $360 for the YMCA.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Mattson, lawyer for the Ridley Area YMCA, said his client
was in compliance with Act 55 because the Y was undertaking
activities specifically outlined in its charter. ``My client has
made a commitment to this community, and we believe this includes
health club services,'' said Mattson, who added that the YMCA
offers community outreach programs like child care, after-school
programs and classes for older people.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania is the first state with a law that defines
competition between charities and small businesses. If it is found
that the Ridley Area YMCA is in violation of the new law, then the
YMCA must reconfigure its services or forfeit its tax exemptions.
The original case was dismissed by a lower court and is expected to
be appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County, Pa.,
this year. Several other states are considering similar
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy, of the trade group for health clubs, was quick to
point out that most nonprofit organizations did important work and
deserved their tax breaks. ``Most are a valuable asset to their
community,'' he said. ``Only a very few abandon their charitable
principles by operating like full-scale, for-profit health clubs.''

IMPLANTED CHIP OFFERS HOPE OF SIMPLIFYING DRUG REGIMENS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOHN O'NEIL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pills are simple: Their coatings dissolve and medicine travels
throughout the body. In recent years, some surgeons have begun
using a more targeted delivery system, implanting tiny vials of
potent medicine directly into tumors, where it seeps out gradually.
</P>
<P>
   Now engineers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
have built a prototype of something far more sophisticated: a kind
of micropill, a dime-sized silicon microchip that could release a
combination of drugs on a preprogrammed schedule or by remote
control.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Langer, a chemical and biomedical engineering
professor, and Dr. Michael J. Cimat, a material sciences professor,
previously came up with a way of using ultrasound technology to
deliver some medicines through the skin without breaking the
surface, a process now in clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   Working with a chemical engineering graduate student, John T.
Santini Jr., they turned to the question of devising a delivery
system that would offer physicians greater control over dosage and
timing. In research described last week in the journal Nature, they
made use of techniques already developed for the manufacture of
computer chips to carve a compartment with a volume of 25
nanoliters _ about a quarter of one grain of salt _ out of a
silicon wafer. Devices that work on the same principle as ink-jet
printers can, with computer guidance, fill those compartments with
doses of medicine as low as 2 nanoliters, Dr. Langer said.
</P>
<P>
   The harder part was figuring out what kind of a cap to put on
that compartment _ a lid that could be removed on command using a
kind of remote control. They made the covering out of a gold
membrane, a mere three-millionths of a meter thick, surrounded by a
chloride solution. That is strong and stable enough to hold in the
dose _ except in the presence of an electrical charge. ``Apply a
little voltage,'' Dr. Langer said, ``and the gold will dissolve
into a gold chloride solution. Now the cap is off and the contents
can come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Langer said much work remained to be done to go from their
``proof of principle'' prototype _ a model meant to show that the
concept could work _ to actual use. In particular, they would like
to find biodegradable materials, which would allow a device to be
implanted and then left to dissolve after use.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that a crucial question would be determining
when using such a complicated device would be worth the trouble.
``Any type of implant wouldn't do for a cold, but would for
cancer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some implants already being used with cancer patients can
deliver tiny dosages. ``But they don't offer the kind of control,
for multiple drugs or different release patterns,'' Dr. Langer
said. And in coming stages of research, they hope to combine the
chip with a microbattery and biosensors, to make a device able to
react to changes within body tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Looking down the road, Dr. Langer envisions a wider range of
uses. ``They could be swallowable,'' he said. ``Right now a lot of
elderly patients have to take five or six drugs at different times
of day. You might be able to take a single pill and put all the
different dosages inside.''

GOVERNOR'S MERCY MAY BE HIS DOWNFALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB RAY SANDERS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The governor of Missouri did a courageous and compassionate
thing last week, but his brave act of mercy may end up costing him
his political career.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a personal plea from Pope John Paul II, Gov. Mel
Carnahan commuted the death sentence of Darrell Mease, a convicted
triple murderer.
</P>
<P>
   According to The Associated Press, a message from the pope was
relayed to the governor Wednesday afternoon by the Vatican's
secretary of state, Cardinal Angelo Sodano. Later, after a prayer
service at a St. Louis church, ``the pope came down from the altar
and personally asked the governor to `extend mercy' to Mease,'' the
wire report said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, in what some regard as a true miracle, Carnahan,
who still maintains that he is a supporter of capital punishment,
commuted Mease's sentence to life.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he made the decision in response to the pope's
direct plea ``because of a deep and abiding respect for the pontiff
and all he represents.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a most commendable act by this politician who is likely
to be a candidate for the U.S. Senate next year.
</P>
<P>
   In a day when many politicians ``against'' the death penalty
have to declare their support ``for'' capital punishment in order
to get elected, it was refreshing to see Carnahan take such a gutsy
stand on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of action, however, that can ruin political
careers in a country where most people not only favor capital
punishment, but believe it ought to be applied more often and more
swiftly. Surely, it will cost Carnahan some votes, but I hope it
will gain him some as well.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the governor feels he can weather any political storm over
this issue by winning over Missouri's Catholic vote. Of all the
religious groups in this country, Catholics have been among the
least hypocritical on the issue of the death penalty _ staunchly
opposing it.
</P>
<P>
   As much as I applaud Carnahan's decision to grant a reprieve in
this one case, the fact that the governor plans to return to his
usual death-penalty stance reiterates one of the major problems
with capital punishment in this country.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's act, no matter how laudable, underscores the
arbitrariness and capriciousness of this ultimate punishment.
Whether acting on conviction, conscience or papal plea, the
governor's decision to spare one life and ignore the destruction of
another makes it a pathetic act of mercy.
</P>
<P>
   We saw a similar example in Texas just two weeks ago when there
were two Death Row inmates _ both proclaiming their innocence _
scheduled to die within two days of each other. One received a stay
from the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals just hours before he was
scheduled to die.
</P>
<P>
   The courts and the governor of Texas refused to even look at the
case of the other man, sealing his fate to die by lethal injection
Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``I renew the appeal I made most recently at Christmas for a
consensus to end the death penalty, which is both cruel and
unnecessary,'' the pope told a St. Louis crowd attending the
largest indoor Mass ever held in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   If we repeat that message long enough, maybe a few more people
will hear it.
</P>
<P>
   And, just maybe, instead of one man saving one life, there will
be many more people in this country fighting to save the lives of
the thousands of men and women on Death Rows across America.

SUPER BOWL XXXIII: EXCESSIVELY GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The field at Pro Player Stadium was half-covered in
glitter and confetti, tamped down by a late-evening shower, as
though something of enduring magnificence had just occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The real themes of Super Bowl XXXIII, though, were found
elsewhere. They were in John Elway's mind, and Eugene Robinson's
soul, and Dan Reeves' eyes, and even Shannon Sharpe's knee. The
football was fine enough as it goes, but Denver's 34-19 victory
here Sunday almost borders on afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the Broncos beat the Atlanta Falcons the way a snake
eats an egg _ slowly, but wholly. The subplots gave this game its
flavor, its context, and its place in history. You'll need more
than the usual half-hour video primer from NFL Films to make full
sense of it all.
</P>
<P>
   Elway, the Broncos quarterback, paved his way to retirement, if
he so chooses, with his best Super Bowl performance, throwing for
336 yards and one touchdown and running for another en route to the
Most Valuable Player award. But it was the rheumy look in his eye
during the National Anthem that got people to thinking we were
seeing his last, and best, waltz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I was crying,'' he said, building up to a
brief stream-of-consciousness rap that hinted at retirement without
actually saying it. ``I definitely got a little bit emotional out
there, and I was just really kind of thanking God for the
opportunity and to stand there and finally get going and look
around to see what was going on because this is the greatest game
in the world and so, yeah, it was emotional, definitely emotional
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, the Falcons safety who played Elway's foil on the
killing 80-yard touchdown pass to Rod Smith in the second quarter,
confronted not only his on-field failings but also the destruction
of his reputation after being arrested for soliciting a sex act
from an undercover Miami policewoman. Unlike most people Saturday
night when smacked full-face with their inexplicable recklessness,
he not only explained it to the world, but he seemed almost eager
to do so, turning on its head the tale of the fallen angel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say a lot about this, because it's in the hands of my
lawyer,'' Robinson said with an almost intimidating earnestness.
``I was innocent but not righteous in this deal. A friend of mine
told me, `Confession is good for the soul, but bad for the
reputation.' My reputation, I can deal with that. But the hurt I
caused my wife and my children is what gives me the pain. I know
some of you will say, `Hypocritical Christian,' and like that.
Well, I deserve that. I'll take that.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Reeves, now a four-time Super Bowl loser,
with interest compounded by the fact this meal was force-fed him by
the two people he still believes ran him out of Denver, Elway and
Mike Shanahan. He spoke from the high road, but his eyes betrayed
his sadness, even when he stood at the side of Elway's podium and
congratulated him. He never spoke of the foul aftertaste, choosing
to hide behind the losing coach's traditional curtain of platitudes
rather than focus on the stabbing pain in his stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't play well,'' he said without the jut-jawed
conviction with which he usually tackles a question. ``I knew if we
didn't play well, we would get beat, and that's what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing about Elway or Shanahan, surely none of the candor that
marked his soliloquy of 10 days earlier when he spoke so earnestly
of how he felt Elway and Shanahan hurt him in Denver. He couldn't
raise that issue again because, in the frontier justice that is
football, the winners talk, and the losers listen.
</P>
<P>
   Even the week-long episodic sitcom, ``Your Mother; My Mother?
No, Your Mother'' between tight end Sharpe and Atlanta cornerback
Ray Buchanan ended with a strange serendipity. Sharpe's only catch
came in the first quarter, setting up Denver's first touchdown, but
he was hit sharply in the left knee by Buchanan, tore a ligament
and missed the final three quarters. He didn't do enough to talk
the talk, but Buchanan didn't do enough to talk the talk, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great time,'' Sharpe said of everything but the hit.
``I did my job as far as getting you media guys hyped, and Ray did
his job as far as getting you media guys hyped. I said it before.
It was just talk. It was just hype.''
</P>
<P>
   It was indeed just hype. But when superimposed upon John Elway's
future, Eugene Robinson's torment, Dan Reeves' place in football
history, and even Lawrence Taylor's election to the Pro Football
Hall of Fame, it took Super Bowl XXXIII over the top. Part
melodrama, part crime story, part Kabuki, part angry man theater
... and a football chaser. It was all too much, the way Super Bowls
are always billed but never play out, the triumph of excess at its
most gloriously excessive.

MOST SUPER BOWL COMMERCIALS AS DULL AS THE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ You know it's a letdown when the Super Bowl is
so boring that you can't wait for another commercial. And you know
it's a long, wasted day when you're bitter that the commercials
weren't funnier or more daring.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we put too much pressure on advertising agencies to
score with Super Bowl ads. Because this year there was precious
little to speak of, and perhaps only one that you'll remember to
talk about around the water cooler.
</P>
<P>
   Monster.com's ads featuring cynical kids talking about work were
far and away the most memorable. ``I want to have a brown nose.''
``I want to be underappreciated.'' ``I want to be forced into early
retirement.'' Black and white. Hilarious and chilling all at once.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday marked what looks to be the end of the Budweiser Frogs _
which couldn't come soon enough. Talk about a campaign that was
played out.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a rundown, with star ratings, of most _ but not all _ of
the day's ads:
</P>
<P>
   Pizza Hut's New York style pizza. It worked with Spike Lee and
his ``You got nothin'!'' rants, but failed with Fran Drescher and
her bad Audrey Hepburn look.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's use of Hal the computer and the memory of ``2001: A
Space Odyssey'' to mock others for not being Y2K ready. Spooky and
wry and it made a point.
</P>
<P>
   The MasterCard ``priceless'' campaign with a host of cartoon
characters was well conceived and retro. Olive Oyl and Wonderbra _
nice.
</P>
<P>
   The Budweiser frogs series. Yawn.
</P>
<P>
   Selsun Blue. What? Why waste your money?.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi One ad with the ``Reservoir Dogs'' poof: All style, no
substance. Like the drink.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria's Secret promo for its on-line fashion show. It had the
jiggle factor for male football fans, but are they really going to
jump into cyberspace instead of watch ``SportsCenter'' for
highlights? Not likely.
</P>
<P>
   The Bud lobster trying to stay alive. Beats the frogs.
</P>
<P>
   Cracker Jacks ``really big bag'' ad. Very funny and creative:
The giant bag falls off a car trying to park in a garage and
crushes a man at a game, among others.
</P>
<P>
   The Visa Check Card. The guy locked in the bathroom at his
date's house was decent, the Buckingham Palace guard without his
uniform was clever.
</P>
<P>
   The Budweiser Dalmatians' sibling rivalry, well, was nothing
special.
</P>
<P>
   Monster.com: We love cynical.
</P>
<P>
   Frito-Lay BBQ Doritos: Can we end the lame
hot-chick-makes-dumb-guys-drool genre right here?.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-Up ``un'' campaign: Confusing and not very interesting.
Undo it.
</P>
<P>
   Mail Boxes Etc. scored by doing a simple ad highlighting a
customer who makes ice cream. Full of charity and good spirit,
which made it stand out.
</P>
<P>
   The AT&AMP;T ``If this is you'' campaign: If this is your idea of
selling something, start again. And enough with the
bold-words-across-the-image look. That's so early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Bud Light ad where two guys have to choose between their
six-pack and toilet paper. ``Paper or plastic'' is the punch line?
And a rule to remember: Never blow all your money on ``lite'' beer.
Ever.
</P>
<P>
   Crispy M&AMP;Ms. Not even Halle Berry in a swimsuit could save this
bomb. And Patrick Warburton's ``Seinfeld'' act is sooooo tired.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell: The slacker kid who only wants to work from noon
to 3 p.m. This is a good campaign (only one aired) and it should be
encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   Progressive Auto Insurance: Who sold out ``ET''? This is a
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota ad with Steve Young on a blind date with a woman who
doesn't watch football or TV: Quick, intelligent and funny.
</P>
<P>
   California Cheese, moon made of cheese riff: Almost, but not
quite.
</P>
<P>
   Hotjobs.com daydreaming security guard. Very good and very
creative. Who knew there'd be two Super Bowl ads _ both good _ from
on-line companies trying to get people new jobs?
</P>
<P>
   The World Wrestling Federation and it's ``wholesome image''
campaign. Funny and violent _ two great qualities in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   American Express and Jerry Seinfeld getting out of New York to
get a life: As usual, this was great. ``I can't feel my face!''
``I'm going crazy out here!'' More of these, please.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Express and its misplaced Stanley Cup ad: Almost, but
not quite (a familiar feeling to the day).
</P>
<P>
   Michelob beer and its football player traded for a case of beer.
Wasn't a frog, but it wasn't much either.
</P>
<P>
   Siebel: What? Who are these people? Do they own Selsun Blue?.
</P>
<P>
   The Land Rover boy-seeking-friend ad. Not clever enough to be a
Super Bowl ad, but not bad for a regular Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Just for Feet: Did anybody else get a weird slavery overtone
from this ad that tried too hard and fell flat? Let's see, a
barefoot man in Kenya is running _ or is he being hunted? _ then he
passes out and wakes up with shoes on his feet and screams. Wow.
Too much salsa or this was a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL fan ``Thank You'' campaign. Wonderful (if not entirely
sincere). Keep it into next year.
</P>
<P>
   Buy.com: Thus ends the on-line creative thing. A man sniffing a
dog's butt is like you're not even trying.
</P>
<P>
   Budweiser billiards: There comes a point when beer ads blend
together. This is that point.
</P>
<P>
   The day also featured quite a bit of advertising for future
movies, some of which looked intriguing. Unless it happened on a
nature break, Nike didn't advertise and that's a shame. While there
were a handful of really good ads, there weren't five you're dying
to replay to friends, ones you'll remember next week or any that
packed a wallop to your senses.

NO MORE INDEPENDENT COUNSELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c. 1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the famous words of Steve Forbes: Stomp it, kill
it, never let it rise again.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' target for massive destruction during the 1996 GOP
presidential campaign was the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   This time the object of derision is the sweeping statute
authorizing the office of independent counsel, which has been
leached of all respect by Kenneth Starr's abuse of his powers.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any Washington politician who still likes the
independent counsel law, that worthy has lost his or her tongue or
is in hiding. It is the legislative equivalent of a poison pill.
</P>
<P>
   Mercifully, the danged thing lapses in June if Congress does not
renew it. Letting it conveniently expire provides a dignified,
bipartisan way out of a well-intentioned concept that has become an
uncontrollable legal and political monster.
</P>
<P>
   For months, politicians of both parties have been publicly
counting nails in the coffin of the independent counsel law. When
Attorney General Janet Reno rejected Republican pressure to seek an
outside counsel to investigate charges of campaign finance abuse by
President Clinton and Vice President Gore, GOP Sen. Fred Thompson
declared that to be the ``final nail'' in the statute's coffin.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there have been so many additional lid-fasteners on
that political box that the law can be promptly buried without
tears.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Reno also declined to appoint another independent
counsel to probe charges of campaign finance hanky-panky by former
Clinton aide Harold Ickes. It sent a signal that she is fed up with
the congressional habit of demanding Democratic officials be
investigated for potential wrongdoing by overzealous prosecutors
with unlimited budgets, authority and self-righteousness.
</P>
<P>
   The public was also reminded once again of the lengths to which
Starr's office will go to keep kicking Clinton while he is down: A
report leaked that Starr had decided he could constitutionally
indict Clinton for a criminal offense while Clinton is still in
office and is actively considering doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Both the legal basis for an indictment grounded in Starr's
ambiguous and contradictory evidence and the interpretation of a
permissive Constitution are on dangerously shaky ground.
</P>
<P>
   Such a decision would set off a political and constitutional
furor bound to backfire against the Republicans in the 2000
elections. A new Newsweek poll indicates that by a 65-to-30-percent
margin, voters say the president should not be indicted and tried
for his actions during the Monica matter even AFTER he leaves
office.
</P>
<P>
   Sensibly, the majority feels that enough is enough. The vision
of a former president of the United States _ leader of the free
world, for pity's sake _ going off to jail in leg irons and
handcuffs for lying about illicit sex is too ludicrous to
contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   And the timing of the leak, coming in the midst of Clinton's
impeachment trial, seemed designed to meddle once again in the
Senate's decision-making process, adding another Clinton-is-a-crook
story to the public relations mix.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Starr has shown much consideration lately for judicial
objectivity. He intervened on behalf of the House prosecutors to
arrange their interview with Monica Lewinsky, threatened Webster
Hubbell and Susan McDougal with further jail terms despite their
dwindling usefulness as anti-Clinton witnesses and indicted Julie
Hiatt Steele for lying when she said Kathleen Willey had not told
her Clinton groped her.
</P>
<P>
   The picture this projects is of a judicial process run wild.
Starr himself cannot be stopped; the law lets him go on until he
runs out of gas. But the law itself can be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   The two committees with jurisdiction over the statute, the House
judiciary Committee and the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee,
are partisan snakepits that have already shown an inability to
reach common ground. The GOP majority on the House committee rammed
through the impeachment articles and a similar GOP majority in the
Senate conducted inconclusive hearings into campaign finance
abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Those committees are unlikely vehicles to produce the delicate
legislative tinkering necessary to reshape the law into a fair,
balanced system recognizing the concept but creating sensible
restraints. Republicans opposed the law when it was used against
GOP president Ronald Reagan; now that Democrats have had a taste of
that particular bitter medicine, they oppose it too.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, this columnist supported the law, as a means of
avoiding the potential conflict of interest of having the Justice
Department investigate administration colleagues. But the cure
turned out to be worse than the ailment. Five independent counsels
are now at work investigating Clinton and four present or past
members of his Cabinet. One indictment for lying, that of
Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, recently ended in an acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   There may be some way eventually to reauthorize the law with
strict restrictions capping its duration and budget and limiting
its powers to probes of official misconduct rather than private
impropriety. But that is not possible in today's polarized
political climate. So give it a rest for awhile. Maybe we will feel
the need to come back to it, maybe not.

CYBERSPACE TOUTED AS SAFER FOR GIRL SCOUTS THAN DOOR-TO-DOOR
SELLING

<P>
   BURLESON, Texas _ Brittany Williams has taken Girl Scout cookie
sales into a new neighborhood: cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-year-old Brownie has taken to the Internet to sell those
celebrated thin mints and other popular Girl Scout cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Although Brittany doesn't prefer one method over another, she
says, ``It's better than having to go door to door when it's cold
or hot.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the low-tech method has proved more successful than the
high-tech way. The Frazier Elementary School second-grader has sold
more than 100 boxes of cookies by e-mailing Internet users in the
area and 358 boxes the old-fashioned way, surpassing her personal
goal of 400.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize that I was going to sell so many,'' Brittany
said.
</P>
<P>
   A few troops around the country have Web pages offering cookies
for sale. But some local Girl Scout officials say local troops
don't offer such an ordering system, and they don't know of other
area girls who are using e-mail to make individual sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say that is unusual,'' said Sue Blocker, services
manager for Three Corners Community, a center that assists Girl
Scouts in Burleson and the nearby communities of Crowley and
Joshua.
</P>
<P>
   But Cathy O'Neal, spokeswoman for the Circle T Council, which
includes Three Corners and Fort Worth, said that Brittany's
approach will probably catch on.
</P>
<P>
   Brittany's mother, Kim Williams, said it already has.
</P>
<P>
   The mother-daughter team has been contacted for e-mailing tips
by Girl Scouts in 11 states, including Oregon, California, and
Florida, the mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Williams thought of the idea. Using the People Search
function on her Internet service provider, she sought America
Online users in Burleson.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we exhausted everyone in Burleson on AOL, we actually
went out on the Web using the Netfind People Finder,'' the mother
said. ``The first 400 were AOL users; the last were with other
providers.''
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter then e-mailed a sales pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``My troop is selling cookies to go to summer camp,'' the letter
reads in part. ``My mom told me that this is safer than going door
to door, and I'm learning about marketing and computer skills. Girl
Scout cookies are really good. ... They are $3 a box and you pay
when they come in, which is right after Valentine's Day. Thank You,
Brittany and Troop 3444.''
</P>
<P>
   Brittany makes printed copies of the e-mailed information and
will make the deliveries and pick up the money.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Williams said most of their Internet customers are rural
residents who don't get door-to-door sales calls. But Brittany has
also gotten responses from lawyers, real estate agents and
businesspeople who congratulate her on her ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
   Doy Cloninger, a Burleson resident who responded to Brittany,
said he was about to delete her message along with a lot other
trash e-mail when he noticed that it was sent from Burleson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a pretty good marketing idea to e-mail
someone. (It's) easy access,'' Cloninger said. ``It just seems like
it was easier than going door to door.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Williams said she screens all e-mail before Brittany sees
them. Mother and daughter compose thank-you e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal said the Circle T Web page has a number that people can
call if they want to find out how to get cookies in their area.
</P>
<P>
   And Internet browsers can e-mail the San Antonio Area Council
for information on how to order cookies. Girl Scout Troop 1035 in
northern Virginia has obtained certification as a safe shopping
site and takes major credit cards for orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Girl Scouts have stepped up in technology,'' Kim
Williams said. ``It's using today's technology to do something
they've done since 1912.''
</P>
<P>
   Brittany has already sold beyond the maximum amount needed for
prizes. Her extra sales will win her ``cookie credits'' that are
applied toward summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   Brittany's e-mail address is getacookie(at)aol.com.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rain will drench sections of the Northeast as a warm front
pushes northward along the Atlantic Seaboard. Gusty onshore winds
will reach gale force on the New England coast. Farther inland,
cold air trapped in the valleys from northeast New York to southern
Maine will allow for a period of freezing rain during the morning.
Wet snow will be mixed with sleet in the higher terrain of northern
Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.
</P>
<P>
   A cold front pushing off the East Coast will end the showery
rains from the Middle Atlantic states to northern Florida. A few
thunderstorms will persist over southern Florida. Clouds will
linger across the Appalachians with scattered showers developing
along the west slopes of the mountains as a new cold front
approaches. There will be breaks in the clouds in the Carolinas and
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific air will stream east across the Plains as high pressure
builds over the central Rockies. Seasonably mild weather along with
sunshine is expected from Nebraska to Texas. The Gulf Coast will
stay dull as a stream of moisture from the central Pacific merges
with the tail end of a front in the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Despite gusty, drier winds from the northwest, clouds will cover
most of the upper Plains with some flurries in the Dakotas. A cold
front racing into the Northwest will produce rain and strong winds
on the Washington and northern Oregon Coast. Snow levels will rise
in the northern Cascades. The Southwest will be bright and milder.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Moon Matters
</P>
<P>
   There are times when weather forecasters pay attention to the
moon. For example, the surge of water associated with a landfalling
hurricane is highest around the time of high tide, and it is
further magnified when the moon is full. Low tide, which recedes to
its lowest mark when the moon is full, can also pose danger. On
Monday, strong ocean winds pushed water onshore along the east
coast of Florida. Then, around 2 p.m., as low tide began in earnest
in response to a nearly full moon, water that was piled-up near
shore flowed swiftly out to sea, raising the risk of dangerous rip
currents.

FROM MICROSCOPE TO PEN  
 YOUNG TERMITES IN LOVE  
 MEASURING MUSCLE ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Researchers at Northwestern University have performed a bit of
alchemy in the lab: turning a precision analytical instrument, an
atomic force microscope, into a precision writing instrument.
</P>
<P>
   An atomic force microscope uses a fine stylus that rides the
surface of an object in order to render it in molecular detail. One
continual problem with such microscopes is the tendency of a small
amount of water to condense in the tiny gap between the stylus and
the object.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers turned the problem into an opportunity. They
noticed that the water moves by capillary action between the stylus
and the object, and theorized that it could be used to transfer a
chemical, a few molecules at a time, much as the nib of a pen
transfers ink to paper.
</P>
<P>
   The Northwestern researchers used an oily compound called
octadecanethiol, or ODT, as ink, and a thin layer of gold fused to
mica as paper. They were able to write lines of ODT a few dozen
molecules wide _ about 30 nanometers, or slightly over a millionth
of an inch.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists, who described the technique in the journal
Science, suggested that it could have applications in the
manufacture of minuscule electronic circuits. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How tough can it be to be a termite, acting (literally) like a
bump on a log, chomping wood to its heart's content?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty tough, apparently, at least when love is concerned. A
termite's life can be a real soap opera, according to a recent
study by a Cornell University biologist.
</P>
<P>
   The biologist studied the mating habits of Zootermopsis
nevadensis, a type of termite native to California woodlands. She
found that within an hour or two after a male and female get
together on a log to establish a nest, their eyes, and hearts,
start to wander.
</P>
<P>
   Some females, according to the study, will invite a second male
to the nest site to fight the first for mating rights. And for
their part, some males will simply fly off in search of different
partners.
</P>
<P>
   Since nevadensis couples cooperatively care for their young,
such mutual choosing (or re-choosing) of mates, which is common in
vertebrates, makes sense. Just as a person might decide that a
boyfriend or girlfriend is less than perfect for creating a family,
a termite would want the best possible partner for the long term.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that in making a second choice for a mate,
female termites often chose males with bigger heads (the better to
butt and bite an opponent). Males, though, often opted for females
better suited to reproduction, with bigger bodies and more room for
storing fat.
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The basic mechanism by which muscles work is no mystery.
First-time biology students learn about the interleaved proteins in
muscle fiber, actin and myosin, and how myosin uses adenosine
triphosphate, or ATP, as an energy source to move along the actin
filament and pull it in one direction. That action, repeated
countless times across a muscle, is what causes contraction.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Japanese researchers have discovered exactly how far the
myosin ``head,'' as the working end of the protein is known,
travels. Using a very thin crystal needle to which a myosin
fragment was attached, the researchers measured how much the needle
deflected as the myosin was brought in contact with an actin
filament in the presence of ATP.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that instead of a smooth movement along
the actin filament, the myosin traveled in discrete steps, with
each step 5.3 nanometers long, or about two 10-millionths of an
inch. The myosin can move in two to five steps in rapid succession,
producing total travel of about 11 to 30 nanometers (which may
account for some earlier measurements of myosin travel that were in
that range).
</P>
<P>
   Rather than breaking down an ATP molecule for each step, myosin
makes the multiple steps through only one ATP cycle.

   Daughter Faces Status Question 
 &HT;       
 By Ilana DeBare  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  My daughter works as the personal assistant to a woman
who is wildly successful in the multimedia world. She works
exclusively for this woman, at this woman's office. Her employer
pays her by the hour as an independent contractor, so she receives
no benefits, no vacation and must pay self-employment tax on her
earnings. Is this proper and legal?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer:  &LR; The facts are pretty sketchy but, off the bat, I'd say
that your daughter is very likely being illegally misclassified as
a contractor.
</P>
<P>
   She's not alone. Confusion over employee/contractor status is a
growing problem nowadays, from small startups to Fortune 500
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last couple of years, we've been dealing with questions
like this a great deal,'' said Conley Baker of the Employers Group,
a California nonprofit that provides human resources help to its
member firms. ``I think it has to do with downsizing. Companies
need work to be done but don't want to hire people as regular
employees to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service used to have a checklist of 20
different criteria for telling whether someone is an employee or
independent contractor. Recently, they've boiled these down to
three major categories:
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Behavioral control &LR; . &LR;   &LR; Contractors generally have great
freedom to do the work any way they want _ any time, any place, as
long as the job gets done. Employees, on the other hand, follow
directions from their employers about how, where and when to do the
job.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Financial control &LR; . Contractors are usually paid a flat fee
for an entire project and risk losing money if the job takes longer
than expected, while employees are paid a weekly, monthly or hourly
wage and incur little personal financial risk. Contractors also
tend to invest in their own tools and business materials, while
employees use equipment and materials supplied by the company.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Type of relationship. &LR;   &LR; Contractors tend to be hired for
limited amounts of time, while employees are hired on an open-ended
basis. And contractors tend to perform work that is not a key
aspect of the company's business: An accountant who is hired to do
a once-a-year audit is probably a contractor, while the bookkeeper
who handles day-to-day office finances is probably an employee.
</P>
<P>
   I'm guessing that your daughter is an employee for a variety of
reasons. She's paid hourly on an open-ended basis, she's working
solely for this one woman, and I bet the boss directs her work and
sets her hours.
</P>
<P>
   Your daughter should approach her employer and politely explain
that she doesn't want the company to run afoul of the IRS or other
agencies by misclassifying her.
</P>
<P>
   And in fact, there are big financial risks to an employer who
messes up here _ such as liability for back payroll taxes,
unemployment taxes, disability insurance and other benefits, and
workers compensation payments.
</P>
<P>
   Want more information on how to determine if someone is an
employee or an independent contractor? See IRS Publication 15A, the
Employer's Supplemental Tax Guide. You can get it by calling (800)
TAX-FORM or visiting the IRS Web site at  &LR; www.irs.ustreas.gov &LR; . You
may also want to read the excellent guidebook, ``Hiring Independent
Contractors: The Employer's Legal Guide,'' by Stephen Fishman (Nolo
Press).
</P>
<P>
   Burning Bridges
</P>
<P>
   Q: About seven months ago, I quit a job that I'd held very
successfully for five years. Now I'd like to return to the company,
but the human resources department isn't returning my calls. I
think that I'm being blacklisted because of critical things I said
about my old manager during my exit interview. At the time, I was
told the exit interview would be confidential. Is it fair to hold
my honest comments against me this way? Can they refuse to hire me
back because of things I said in a supposedly-confidential
interview?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Like much in the working world, this company's refusal to
hire you back may not be fair _ but it's completely legal.
</P>
<P>
   Companies have the right to hire or reject whomever they want,
as long as they're not discriminating on a basis such as race or
gender.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies even have formal policies against rehiring anyone
who's quit _ no matter how good their performance was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I hired back a woman who had left for four months and I
had a number of human resources people say to me, `I'm surprised
you had her come back,''' said Patricia Stansbury, CEO of Stansbury
Staffing Consultants and president of the Northern California Human
Resources Association.
</P>
<P>
   This company should, of course, have the basic civility to
return your calls and tell you what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   But don't hold your breath waiting for that. Write them off your
job-hunt list and move on to other employers.
</P>
<P>
   And in the meantime, try to draw some lessons from this episode.
</P>
<P>
   One is to avoid burning bridges when leaving jobs. It can be
tempting to say ``Whee-hoo! Take this job and shove it!'' the
minute you get an offer from a new employer.
</P>
<P>
   But six months or two years from now, the company you're leaving
may look awfully good again. So make sure you end your stay at any
job in a professional fashion _ giving plenty of notice, staying
engaged in your work through the end and offering to help train
your replacements.
</P>
<P>
   Another lesson is to remain equally professional during exit
interviews. Perhaps you did this, and the company just didn't want
to hear any criticism at all. But perhaps you let off steam in a
way that alienated them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to tell the truth,'' Stansbury said. ``But be
circumspect. Keep your comments on very specific behaviors and
situations. If you talk about how a manager always came in late
while he was asking his employees to be on time, they shouldn't
hold that against you. But never get into character assassination.
If you bad-mouth a manager's personality, it will just be
considered gossip.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; MORE ON MATERNITY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Last week's column included a question about maternity leave
rights from a woman who had been laid off from her job, became
pregnant and is now about to be called back to work. Attorney
Judith Kurtz of San Francisco points out that California's
pregnancy disability leave law applies to all pregnant employees,
regardless of how long they've been on the job. So if this woman
returned to work for even one day, California law would make her
eligible for up to four months of pregnancy disability leave,
including about six weeks off after childbirth.

`PREPARE FOR SAINTS': WHEN `FOUR SAINTS' SHOOK UP THE OLD GUARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   First produced in 1934, in the midst of the Depression, the
Virgil Thomson-Gertrude Stein opera ``Four Saints in Three Acts''
remains one of this century's most famous avant-garde works.
</P>
<P>
   An insouciant piece that contains neither four saints nor three
acts, the opera cheerfully thumbed its nose at convention: Stein's
willfully hermetic text dispensed with plot, sequential time and
discernible meaning, while Thomson's American-inflected, almost
naively tuneful score defied traditional operatic standards.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that an all-black cast and Florine Stettheimer's
shimmering cellophane sets, and you had one of the most
talked-about events of the day: a show that caught the imagination
of cafe society and became (albeit briefly) the longest-running
opera on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, ``Prepare for Saints,'' the journalist Steven
Watson argues that the success of ``Four Saints in Three Acts''
``epitomized the mainstreaming of modernism'' in 1930s America. The
intertwined lives of the opera's collaborators and the story of the
show's evolution, he suggests, provide ``a window onto the
brilliant generation that defined modern taste and stylishness in
the early years of the Depression.''
</P>
<P>
   The approach Watson takes in this book is similar to that
employed in his 1991 book ``Strange Bedfellows: The First American
Avant-Garde,'' which took on a slightly earlier period in American
culture and profiled such artists as Ezra Pound, Eugene O'Neill,
Alfred Stieglitz and Marcel Duchamp.
</P>
<P>
   Here as there, Watson weaves together biography, cultural
history and plain old gossip to create a smart, lively but
sometimes skin-deep narrative focused around personalities and
anecdotes. The volume's coffee-table-book tendencies are
unfortunately underscored by inane charts and sidebars like ``1920s
Paris: Trans-Atlantic Residents and Hotspots'' and ``Americanisms
and American Chic.''
</P>
<P>
   For the lay reader, however, Watson does an engaging job of
conjuring up the overlapping worlds his subjects inhabited: the
feud-ridden expatriate community in Paris where Thomson and Stein
met in the 1920s, and the trend-setting bohemia of 1930s New York,
where Thomson would find the patrons and promoters who would get
``Four Saints'' produced.
</P>
<P>
   Watson's quick thumbnail portraits of his principals, often
based on one another's acerbic words, are equally incisive. Stein
emerges from these pages as a ``modernist patriarch'' who radiated
a ``papal authority'' _ an arrogant, difficult woman who coveted
fame despite her reputation for deliberate obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   Her writing, a kind of cubism translated into prose, Watson
reminds us, was once described by Edmund Wilson as ``registering
the vibration of a psychological country like some human
seismograph whose charts we haven't the training to read.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Thomson, he comes across as a worthy sparring partner for
Stein, a sharp-tongued, consummately assured Wunderkind whom Auden
once compared to an intimidating butler at an English country
house. Convinced that dissonant modernist music had reached a dead
end, the future music critic found his voice as a composer in
setting Stein's texts to music, a discipline that inspired in his
work a new simplicity and a renewed allegiance to his own
Midwestern American roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gertrude was wonderful to set to music because there was no
temptation to illustrate the words,'' Thomson observed. ``For the
most part you didn't know what it meant anyway, so you couldn't
make it like birdie babbling by a brook or heavy heavy hangs my
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the task facing Thomson was a daunting one. Stein's
libretto, which invoked the lives of the early Spanish saints as a
kind of metaphor for the lives of artists _ similarly consecrated,
Thomson argued, ``to a nonmaterial end'' _ had not assigned parts
to individual singers, and read, Thomson recalled, as ``a quite
impressive obscurity.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Stein's childlike verses (``Pigeons on the grass alas'')
yielded little in the way of conventional meaning, Thomson was
forced to rely almost exclusively on sounds and rhythms. He set
everything Stein wrote (including the stage directions) to music,
assigned lines to lesser characters and turned St. Teresa into two
figures so he could write duets.
</P>
<P>
   His friend Maurice Grosser later pieced together a scenario for
the opera _ less a narrative than a series of tableaux or vignettes
that would anchor the music and words on the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the opera produced would prove nearly as difficult as
putting it together. By 1932, Watson reports, when Thomson arrived
in New York in search of backers, the Depression had deepened:
``The Metropolitan Opera had nearly gone under, and commercial art
galleries were closing as quickly as they had opened during the
boom years of the 1920s.''
</P>
<P>
   Two intersecting groups of supporters would play a crucial role
in providing the cash and cachet necessary for turning ``Four
Saints'' into the phenomenon it became.
</P>
<P>
   The first was a group of wealthy New York socialites with
advanced cultural tastes, a group that included such hostesses as
Muriel Draper and Constance Askew, the gossip columnist Lucius
Beebe and the editor Frank Crowninshield.
</P>
<P>
   The second was a group Watson calls ``the Harvard modernists'':
a close-knit band of Cambridge friends that included Lincoln
Kirstein, the future ballet impresario who would bring George
Balanchine to the United States; the architect Philip Johnson;
Alfred Barr, the director of the new Museum of Modern Art; A.
Everett ``Chick'' Austin Jr., who as director of the Wadsworth
Atheneum in Hartford, Conn., would provide both a venue and
financing for ``Four Saints,'' and Kirk Askew Jr., who, along with
his wife, Constance, would organize the New York-London salon where
Thomson met John Houseman and Frederick Ashton, the eventual
director and choreographer, respectively, of ``Four Saints.''
</P>
<P>
   The role these Harvard alumni would play in the revamping of
American culture has been written about before _ most notably by
Nicholas Fox Weber in his 1992 book ``Patron Saints: Five Rebels
Who Opened America to a New Art'' _ but Watson dexterously
orchestrates his sketches of them to give the reader an
impressionistic sense of the world that fostered ``Four Saints.''
</P>
<P>
   The reader wishes that Watson had devoted more space in this
volume to the role the opera played in its creators' careers and
its enduring legacy. (The multimedia work of Robert Wilson and
Philip Glass, for instance, is consigned to two glancing
paragraphs.)
</P>
<P>
   But that perhaps lies beyond the ambitions of this book, which
in the end aspires less to critical analysis than to simple
portraiture _ to chronicling ``those blazing years'' when modernism
was brought ``into the settings of the old guard: the opera, the
museum and the ballet.''

RICH SEVERANCE PACKAGES TAP ILL FEELINGS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Rocky Mountain News) 
 
By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Rod Kelly did a slow burn when he heard what kind of
severance packages the employees at BP Amoco were getting.
</P>
<P>
   Severed workers there are getting one month of pay per year of
service up to 12 months, individual outplacement counseling and
thousands of dollars in educational assistance to help them start
new lives.
</P>
<P>
   The company was incredibly generous, Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   When he was cut from Halliburton Co. in September he received
only one week of severance pay and a phone number to the Texas
Workforce Commission. He worked for the Dallas-based company from
1982 to 1990 and then returned in 1997 as a salesman in the global
business development group.
</P>
<P>
   The company gave only a week's pay for every year of service, up
to a maximum of 12 weeks, he said. Even though he initially thought
his prior years would count toward his service, they didn't, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's probably not the only laid-off worker in Houston feeling
a bit burned. At a time when employers have been handing out
severance packages that give employees a week or two of pay for
every year of service, BP Amoco comes along with a Cadillac of a
plan.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco, which plans to terminate more than 6,000 employees
worldwide as part of British Petroleum's purchase of Amoco Corp.,
announced Tuesday it would cut 1,520 of its employees in the
Houston area during the next month.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the employees are leaving BP Amoco with a year or more
of pay in their pockets. In addition to the basic severance pay,
the company gave employees with 26 years of service an extra week
and a half of pay up to a maximum of 71.5 weeks. And the terminated
employees were kept on the payroll until the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
RESPONSIBILITY A FACTOR &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said he understands why companies have to downsize _ they
have to make a profit, after all _ but a company needs to be
responsible too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Halliburton did that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton, one of Houston's largest employers, responded in
writing that the company believes it provides competitive and fair
severance packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the energy industry changes, Halliburton must calibrate its
business to best serve its customers,'' said the statement by
spokesman Dirk Vande Beek.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are intensely competitive with wages and benefits _
they constantly survey each other _ so, will BP Amoco's plush
severance benefit package encourage other companies to up the ante?
</P>
<P>
   Texaco, for example, gives its employees two weeks of severance
pay for every year of service up to a maximum of one year of pay.
The pay, coupled with career counseling and subsidized medical
benefits, was designed to meet the needs of terminated employees,
said spokesman Paul Weeditz. It's also competitive with other
companies' plans.
</P>
<P>
   But will they meet BP Amoco's exit benefits? Well, that's a
merger and Texaco is going through a restructuring that includes
terminating 2,000 employees, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But here are signs out there that severance pay is indeed
getting sweeter.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mobil/Exxon merger, which will eliminate 9,000 jobs, the
company is reportedly planning to give employees a month of pay for
every year of service. Mobil officials said they couldn't discuss
merger-related severance pay until spring.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the rub at Mobil: Employees severed in the normal
course of business _ as opposed to a merger _ receive only two
weeks of pay per year of service up to a maximum of a year.
Employees are reportedly upset with the two-tiered system,
especially since a layoff related to low oil prices is expected by
many Mobil workers soon.
</P>
<P>
   Mobil spokesman Russ Roberts said he can't discuss any rumors of
layoffs except to say Mobil is always looking to tighten its belt.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WILL BP AMOCO RAISE BAR? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So will Halliburton increase its exit packages if it sees others
doing so?
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say since officials there didn't address the
question. But Kelly said Halliburton's exit packages won't be much
different unless it feels some shame.
</P>
<P>
   As for Kelly, he cashed in his 401(k) plan and used his profit
sharing from last year to make ends meet until he finds a new job _
which he promises won't be in the energy industry.
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't take much longer, he figured, speaking from his
home in Spring, Texas. But it would have been nice to get a little
more help.

ANOTHER ROUND IN THE DRINK-A-DAY DEBATE  
 SLIMMER CHILDREN, HEALTHIER HEARTS  
 HAVING BABIES AFTER 40 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

   Contrary to previous reports, women who drink moderately _ up to
one and a half alcoholic drinks a day _ may face no increased risk
of developing breast cancer, according to a decades-long study of
5,000 women in Framingham, Mass. In fact, the study by researchers
at Boston University School of Medicine suggests that breast cancer
risk may even decline slightly as alcohol consumption rises from
none to one and a half drinks a day.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings, published this month in the American Journal
of Epidemiology, should prove reassuring for women who stay within
current dietary guidelines to limit alcohol consumption to one
drink a day. However, they are unlikely to end the ongoing
controversy over the risk of alcohol for women, because previous
studies have linked alcohol consumption in any amount to a risk of
breast cancer greater than that found among nondrinkers.
</P>
<P>
   Although some studies have found no increased risk, a combined
analysis of 38 studies published in 1994 concluded that one drink a
day raised a woman's risk of breast cancer by 10 percent over that
faced by nondrinkers.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Dr. R. Curtis Ellison, senior author of the new
report, pointed out that ``because light alcohol consumption
markedly reduces a woman's risk of heart disease and stroke,
longevity is greater for light drinkers than for abstainers.''
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol in moderation is known to protect the cardiovascular
system, and several studies have suggested that moderate drinking
can lower the overall death rate among women by 5 percent to 20
percent. Dr. Matthew Longnecker of the National Institute of
Environmental Health Sciences pointed out in an accompanying
editorial that, at most, alcohol would account for only about 2
percent of breast cancer cases.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston researchers, led by Dr. Yuqing Zhang, noted that in
most previous studies, breast cancer risk rose primarily among
women who consumed two or more drinks a day.
</P>
<P>
   They said the findings were more likely to reflect the habits of
the average American woman, who consumes no more than one drink a
day.

   Pear-Shaped Is Better
</P>
<P>
   Apple-shaped children _ those with more fat around the
midsection _ have more heart disease risk factors than their
pear-shaped peers, according to a study reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies have shown that adults with more weight around
their waists have higher blood pressure and lower levels of
high-density lipoprotein (``good'' cholesterol) than those whose
weight gravitates around the hips and thighs. But the association
between body shape and cardiovascular disease risk factors had not
been well studied in children and adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   In the current study, which was published in Circulation, the
journal of the American Heart Association, researchers from
Cincinnati measured body fat distribution, blood pressure and blood
fat in 127 boys and girls between 9 and 17 years old. They also
used electrocardiograms to determine the size and thickness of the
left region of their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found higher levels of blood fat and
triglycerides and lower HDL cholesterol in the apple-shaped
children. Systolic blood pressure (the upper number) was also
highest in the apple-shaped children and those with high overall
body fat. In addition, the size of the left side of the heart was
larger for children with chubby stomachs. This region tends to
thicken when high blood pressure makes the heart work harder to
pump blood, the researchers explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where fat is distributed appears to be a more important
influence on cardiovascular risk factors in young people than total
fatness,'' said Dr. Stephen Daniels, the lead author of the
Circulation study.

   Difficult Journeys, Happy Endings
</P>
<P>
   A California study of the rapidly growing number of women having
children after the age of 40 showed that, like their younger
counterparts, almost all of the women had healthy babies. But
things were a lot more complicated along the way, especially for
first-timers.
</P>
<P>
   Not that long ago, every woman who became pregnant later than
her 35th birthday was considered high risk, and women were often
counseled against pregnancy as their 40s approached, said Dr.
William Gilbert, chief author of the study, which was published
last month in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology. But
contraception and careers have changed the traditional timetable,
and more and more women are beginning to have babies at ages long
after their mothers had given away the cribs.
</P>
<P>
   The study, the largest of its kind, looked at all 1.1 million
childbirths recorded in California in 1992 and 1993. Of those,
24,032 involved women older than 40, including 4,777 giving birth
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   That represented a doubling of the percentage recorded a decade
before, said Gilbert, who is the chief of the maternal-fetal
medical division at the University of California Davis Medical
Center in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first-timers who had the highest levels of
complications during pregnancy and delivery. Rates of high blood
pressure and diabetes during pregnancy were more than double those
found in first-time mothers in their 20s.
</P>
<P>
   And more than 60 percent of the older new mothers required
surgical intervention during delivery, including Caesarean sections
for 47 percent, twice the rate of their younger counterparts, the
study found. Women over 40 who had already had children had lower
levels of complications, but still had Caesareans at twice the rate
of younger women who were already mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some of the study's other findings were more promising.
The researchers noted, for example, that there was no statistically
significant difference in infant mortality between younger and
older mothers.
</P>
<P>
   But motherhood over 40 is not easy, Gilbert concluded. Older
women have a harder time conceiving and have more miscarriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you really want to do it,'' Gilbert said, the
California study ``shouldn't stop you. It should prepare you for
what to expect.''

L.A.'S LITTLE TOKYO: STILL A CULTURAL HUB  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For more than a century, a few square blocks in
downtown Los Angeles have been the spiritual center of the largest
Japanese-American community in North America. But times have often
been tough for Little Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   It sprang up in the first place because Japanese immigrants were
barred from owning property in white neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   By the eve of World War II, the area was a thriving enclave of
stores and apartments in the shadow of City Hall, but the forced
internment of Japanese-Americans left it devastated. After the war,
succeeding generations spread to the suburbs and returned mainly to
shop and eat sushi. The 1992 riots scared away tourists and
Angelenos alike, leaving the future uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Little Tokyo is sort of in the middle of a transition
that even those of us who live and work here are not quite sure how
it's going to turn out,'' said Bill Watanabe, executive director of
the Little Tokyo Service Center, a 20-year-old nonprofit social
service and economic development organization. ``What we're trying
to do is see how we can shift from being a community of people who
might live here to a community of people who have some link to the
cultural and ethnic tie.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the opening on Jan. 23 of a new 85,000-square-foot
pavilion at the Japanese American National Museum at 369 East First
Street was a milestone in the community's efforts to endure and
prevail. The new pavilion _ actually a whole new building, designed
by Gyo Obata, architect of the National Air and Space Museum in
Washington _ triples the size of the original museum, which had the
bad luck to open in 1992 on the first day of the Los Angeles riots.
</P>
<P>
   Situated just across a graceful plaza from the original museum,
which is housed in a 1925 former Buddhist temple, the new stone,
steel and glass pavilion, with a peaceful interior garden, will
house changing exhibits from the museum's collection of 30,000
objects, including artifacts, paintings and films. Together, they
trace the Japanese experience in America from earliest immigration
to the present.
</P>
<P>
   Founded by a coalition of Japanese-American businessmen and
World War II veterans, the museum has always emphasized the searing
experience of war and internment on Japanese-Americans, and that
will remain an important part of its mission, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   But the new space, part of a $45 million expansion, allowed
creation of a National Resource Center, a kind of library with an
interactive database of images and text from the museum's
collection, along with changing exhibits by Japanese-American
artists.
</P>
<P>
   The main opening exhibit, on view through 2001, is called
``Common Ground: The Heart of Community.'' It features everything
from an old baseball uniform from a Japanese-American team to a
reconstructed tar-paper barracks from the relocation camp in Heart
Mountain, Wyo., its bare wood floors silent witness to the hysteria
in which 120,000 Japanese-Americans in western states were
imprisoned by presidential order from 1942 to 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Also on view, through July 4, is a video and multimedia
installation by Bruce and Norman Yonemoto, third-generation
brothers based in Los Angeles, known for exploring, among other
things, the role cinematic images play in creating concepts of race
and ethnicity. The museum (213) 625-0414, is open daily except
Mondays; admission $6.
</P>
<P>
   But the museum is not the only new addition in Little Tokyo's
three-block-square area. Last year, the East West Players, a
theater company, moved into the newly restored Union Church
building on San Pedro Street. It has staged a well-received revival
of Stephen Sondheim's ``Pacific Overtures,'' and this winter
featured Danny Glover and Nobu McCarthy in ``Yohen,'' by Philip Kan
Gotanda, about an interracial couple's struggle to preserve their
marriage. Information: (213) 625-7000.
</P>
<P>
   A stroll through Weller Court, a shopping mall with fancy
boutiques, and vending machines selling canned Japanese iced
coffees, leads to the New Otani Hotel at East First and South Los
Angeles Streets, a favorite of Japanese businessmen and tourists,
with its elegant garden and well-regarded restaurant, A Thousand
Cranes.
</P>
<P>
   The James Irvine Garden, an oasis in the traditional Japanese
style, is adjacent to the Japanese American Cultural and Community
Center at 244 South San Pedro Street, where the sweeping red brick
plaza and stone sculpture were designed by the Los Angeles-born
sculptor Isamu Noguchi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there are Japanese shops and businesses throughout
Southern California, so you can buy food and eat noodles anywhere,
and that has made for a gradual shrinking of Little Tokyo,''
Watanabe of the Little Tokyo Service Center said. ``But I think
it's an important place that we can say is our place and has
historical significance.''

buddies parachuted into the crowded palace gardens and cut the

HEARING OVER THE JET ENGINES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trying to figure out what the actors are saying in an in-flight
movie can be exhausting. But a remedy is now widely available:
noise cancellation headsets.
</P>
<P>
   These devices generate sound waves that cancel out or reduce the
rumble of the jet engines, which, researchers say, agitates the
brain and makes passengers feel tired.
</P>
<P>
   The filtered, higher-pitched sounds that remain _ music, for
example, or the voice of the person sitting next to you _ are
bright and clear. Since the 1950s, military and private pilots have
been wearing the headsets to protect their ears and to better hear
radio transmissions. In 1992, they were introduced to the public on
Japan Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent flight, sitting in the back of a Boeing 727, I
compared the most widely available headsets. All the tested
headsets have adapters; instead of using the devices airlines
provide, passengers can plug in their own headsets to listen to
in-flight movies and music (in coach class, you usually still have
to pay to see the movie). Except for a Sony model that fits in the
ear, all were comfortable enough for hours of listening.
</P>
<P>
   The Noisebuster ($69, NCT Group Inc., Stamford, Conn.), was most
effective in silencing the plane's jet engines. The system, which
runs on a pair of AAA batteries, uses lightweight plastic
headphones and a tiny, nearly weightless plastic box to generate
the noise canceling sound waves. For information:
www.nct-active.com or (800) 278-3526.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines is installing the company's systems in the
first- and business-class seats on its international routes. And
Maxell will soon begin marketing the headsets under its name.
</P>
<P>
   Brookstone's Wireless Noise Reduction System ($79) was almost as
good. Its black-and-gray headsets are bigger because the
noise-canceling generators are in the over-the-ear pieces. It is
easy to leave the set on accidentally, so users might want to carry
extra AAA batteries. Information: www.brookstone.com or (800)
351-7222, or at Brookstone stores.
</P>
<P>
   Sony makes an in-the-ear model and two black plastic headsets.
The ear model (estimated selling price: $179.99) is lightweight,
but it may be uncomfortable for some people. Sony makes the most
expensive headsets (also $179.99); not tested was a $89.99 model.
Information: www.sony.com/electronics (under ``accessories'') or
(800) 222-7669.
</P>
<P>
   The high price of the Sony headsets, however, buys the least
noise reduction. Sony specifications say they lower noise by 10
decibels, compared with up to 15 for the Noisebuster and 16 for the
Brookstone. &QL;

THE KING IS BACK IN FINAL VOLUME OF BIOGRAPHY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients0  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 C.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elvis Presley was heading toward Hollywood, driving his van
somewhere outside Flagstaff, Ariz., with his hairdresser-guru Larry
Geller riding shotgun and the knuckle-grumbling crowd from
Graceland sitting in back, when he saw the face of Joseph Stalin in
the clouds above and watched it turn, by long billows, into the
face of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Presley pulled the van over to the side of the road and grabbed
Geller for a run through the tilted desert, yelling, ``I thought to
myself, why Stalin?'' When the cloud image changed to Jesus,
Presley told Geller, ``He smiled at me and every fiber of my being
felt it. For the first time in my life God and Christ are a living
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Geller remembered Presley saying ``Oh, God, Oh, God,'' over and
over, ``then he paused and added a peculiar aside _ `Can you
imagine what the fans would think if they saw me like this?'''
</P>
<P>
   That's as good a story as any to introduce Peter Guralnick's
``Careless Love: The Unmaking of Elvis Presley,'' a 766-page tome
tracking Presley's life from the time he got out of the Army in
1960 until his death in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   The Stalin-Jesus sighting would've come in March of 1965, when
Presley was 30 years old, caught between his search for some kind
of truth through books like ``The Impersonal Life'' and
``Autobiography of a Yogi'' and making sure ``Girl Happy'' made
good money so his next Hollywood whirl would be guaranteed at half
a million bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about the incident of the Stalin cloud at a recent
bookstore reading, Guralnick said, ``Elvis needed that vision. It
was important to him, especially, to see Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   It was important, but not enough to change Presley's life
around. Soon after the Jesus sighting he was rolling the boat in
movable bedrooms with star-lusting women, continuing to turn out
one bad movie after another. Further down the line came his heavy
drug use, the surreal episode of Gog-meets-Randyman in the Oval
Office, and the birth of Lisa Marie, who has just turned 31 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to know what to make of Elvis Presley in the spring of
1968, when he wouldn't sleep with his wife, Priscilla, because
she'd had a child, compromising her purity. It's also hard to know
what Presley would've made of Lisa Marie as a grown-up, of the
tabloids feeding off her life and her bodkin marriage to Michael
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably would've come down to what he thought of Michael
Jackson,'' said Guralnick, pointing out that Presley judged people
by what he could see, by how they treated those around them,
usually giving them the benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He memorized Gen. Douglas MacArthur's farewell speech, and
Martin Luther King's `I Have a Dream' speech,'' said Guralnick.
``His politics were pretty much like Merle Haggard's _ all over the
place. You could read what you wanted into him, and for my own
purposes, I guess, I kind of saw him as a Stevensonian Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   In spite of an all-across-the-country acceptance of Presley and
a Hollywood-Vegas feel to his post-Army career, the bulk of
Presley's story belongs to the South, said Guralnick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It couldn't have happened anywhere else but the South,'' he
said. ``In no other part of the country did they have the closeness
of the black and white cultures the way it was in the South. They
had segregation, yes, but the music _ sitting on porches at night,
whites listening to black music _ it was like nowhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a truly democratic vision. If you kept your ears open,
you couldn't miss it, and Elvis kept his ears open.''
</P>
<P>
   Presley took that democratic vision from Tupelo to Memphis to
Hollywood, a journey that produced Guralnick's first volume _
``Last Train to Memphis,'' a 560-page reliving of Presley's rise
that, together with ``Careless Love,'' puts Guralnick's two-part
biography within 200 pages of ``War and Peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a length when I started out. I didn't have any
set number of pages,'' said Guralnick, 55, a native of Boston and
veteran music reporter who has also written ``Feels Like Going
Home: Portraits in Blues and Rock 'n' Roll'' and ``Searching for
Robert Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Guralnick's refusal to take sides in the saga of Elvis _
his inability to find real fault with traditional villains such as
Col. Parker, Dr. George Nichopoulos and the Memphis Mafia _ that
has brought critical praise for ``Careless Love.''
</P>
<P>
   People want to be able to blame someone for Presley's
drug-taking, even though their own friends and family may have
taken drugs for years, said Guralnick. ``If there is no clear path
in our own lives, why should there be a clear path in history?'' he
asked. ``It's not up to me to judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Presley's '73 Demerol breakdown there were signs he
was teetering on the edge _ not the least of which was a grotesque
visit to the White House at Christmastime of 1970 to beg President
Nixon for a federal narcotic agent's badge, a spur-of-the-moment
look into Presley's own heart of darkness.
</P>
<P>
   After handing a note to a White House guard, Presley was invited
into the Oval Office, carrying a silver-plated Colt. 45 for the
president, signed glossies of Priscilla and Lisa Marie, and his
growing collection of police badges. The Secret Service took the
.45 for safekeeping and Nixon welcomed Presley into his office,
where the singer showed off his cufflinks and Vegas belt and sat
down to talk about the evils of drugs in American society.
</P>
<P>
   Presley got the OK for his badge, then told Nixon, ``Mr.
President, would you have a little time just to say hello to my two
friends, Sonny West and Jerry Schilling?''
</P>
<P>
   As Nixon shook hands and handed out presidential cufflinks,
Presley played the role of the raw American to the hilt, saying,
``You know, they've got wives, too,'' and together with Nixon
rummaged through a desk for suitable gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Since then pictures from the episode _ Nixon in gray, shaking
hands with Presley in blue velour, both grinning oddly at each
other _ have become postcards popular with everyone with a taste
for the bizarre, Democrat and Republican, teetotaller and druggie
alike.
</P>
<P>
   Guralnick said, ``I've come to see it as two lonely people
finding a common thread in each other. ... Both looked at the film
`Patton' over and over, both thought communism was a real threat,
both shared a kind of a wish for privacy that was beyond their
reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the common thread could just have been loneliness,
pure and simple _ the same kind of loneliness that created the
singular world around Elvis Presley.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, said Guralnick, he was hoping he wouldn't have to
write of Presley's death, even though he knew it was coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like when I watch `Chinatown,' my knowledge of that
ending is suspended to give me more pleasure in watching the movie,
and I used that same suspension of disbelief with the book. ...
Like, `Gee, maybe it won't turn out the way we think it will.'''
</P>
<P>
   Guralnick shook his head, saying, ``What he did is just put his
voice out there. It comes through in the Sun Sessions, in the '69
medleys, in his gospel sides. He transcended things, really.''

IMPEACH-AZNOTES (Phoenix) - Arizonans comment on the impeachment
proceedings. By JULIE AMPARANO. Story will move in the ``A''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WOMEN-INVEST (Phoenix) - Women financial experts continue to point
out gender differences when it comes to money behavior and
attitudes, and they're probably right. By RUSS WILES. Story will
move in the ``F'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) - First the guy from the county, then the
guy from the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team, tells me ripping
off schoolchildren is not what they had in mind. And yet, that's
what they're doing. By E.J. MONTINI. Story will move in the ``A''
and ``K'' categories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SOMMER-LEGACY (Undated) - Frederick Sommer died Saturday in
Prescott, Ariz. He was 94. Sommer was the most important artist
living in Arizona, with a world-wide reputation (he had a one-man
show at the Getty a few years ago) and was friends with such
important names as Max Ernst, Edward Weston and Charles Sheeler.
This is a personal retrospective on Sommer. By RICAHRD NILSEN.
Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MOVIES-ARIZONA (Undated) - Two cowboys talk about the Devil in the
Burt Lancaster western, ``Ulzana's Raid.'' One explains, ``He said
if he owned Hell and Arizona, he'd live in Hell and rent out
Arizona.'' That's only the beginning of what Hollywood pictures
have to say about Arizona. Movie-Manhattan is full of witty
sophisticates loving and losing, and cinematic Beverly Hills is
shallowness drowning in glitz. Arizona? It has a bit of an identity
crisis. by BOB FENSTER. Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL;  &QL; 
COMPUTERS-SCHOOL (Phoenix) - Computers have long scored multiple
choice questions, but today's smarter machines are ready to try
grading essay questions. And that's just one way computers are
changing the education experience. E-commerce is coming to the
college campus, with discount online text book retailers
challenging the college book store's monopoly. And another web site
offers online tutoring. By JONATHAN SIDENER. Story moved in the
``L'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
COMPUTER-COLUMN (Phoenix) - Well, we're a month into the new year,
and the computer press is winding up its look back on the top Web
sites of 1998. In checking out some of the lists of top sites, I
found it interesting to note that being a top site in terms of the
number of visitors attracted doesn't necessarily make for a top
site in terms of quality. Take, for example, the lists of top Web
sites published by ``Yahoo! Internet Life'' and ``PC Magazine.'' By
DAVID HOYE. Story moved in the ``F'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
GOODYKOONTZ-COLUMN (Phoenix) - When you're a parent, you often
think not of what you give to your child, but what your child gives
back to you: unconditional love, trust, a sense of purpose, and
every kind of disgusting-fluid, body-aching, night-sweat sickness
you can think of.
</P>
<P>
   That's something you don't learn when reading up in how-to
guides on birthing techniques and diaper changes and whatnot. You
won't find a chapter titled, ``A Guide to Sharing Illness, or, You
Get What They Get, Only Much Worse.'' By BILL GOODYKOONTZ. Story
will move in the ``L'' category. &QL;

USEFUL WEB SITES TO HELP MAP A TRIP TO ANYWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday Feb. 7)  
(ms) 
 By L.R. SHANNON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Web sites for would-be, armchair and actual travelers are
proliferating faster than you can say ``dotcom,'' with so many
links that it's easy to lose your way. Following are 44 useful,
informative or intriguing sites that can help you find or reach
your destination.
</P>
<P>
   PORTALS
</P>
<P>
   To travel on the Web you should have a home, a place where you
pick up the mail or chat with friends. If you belong to one of the
big online services like America Online or Compuserve, you already
have one, with links both to their proprietary sections and to the
Web at large. But they also have homes, called portals, on the Web
proper that are stripped-down versions of their commercial
services; other portals were born on the Web to begin with. All
offer such facilities as e-mail, news, calendars and shopping, and
all have versatile search engines for finding travel sites. You can
narrow your search at the beginning by going into their travel
subsections. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; America Online, &LR;  www.aol.com. This is a crowded page and not as
homey as the regular AOL site. But the travel section is filled
with categories covering destinations, reservations, business
travel, travel news, weather, and airline, cruise, hotel and rental
car directories. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Compuserve, &LR;  www.compuserve.com. Not as dull-looking as the
regular Compuserve site, the travel section is slim, with seven
recommended Web sites, including Barnes &AMP; Noble, where travel books
are sold. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Microsoft Network, &LR;  www.msn.com. Microsoft keeps trying.
Clicking on ``travel'' takes you to Expedia, Microsoft's dedicated
travel site. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Yahoo, &LR;  www.yahoo.com. This is my favorite home on the Web,
with a fairly well-organized travel subsection you can bury
yourself in. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Excite, &LR;  www.excite.com. This is my home away from home. I
usually begin by reading my horoscope to see if taking a trip is a
wise notion.  &QL;

VOUCHERS NOT THE BEST ANSWER FOR EDUCATION PROBLEMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JACK Z. SMITH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been increasingly fashionable in recent years, in Texas and
elsewhere, to verbally bash public schools _ particularly big urban
districts that have large numbers of students achieving at low
academic levels.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as a proposed cure for what ails public schools, there is
growing momentum for government-funded school voucher programs _
essentially, a movement to allocate tax dollars to send students to
private schools.
</P>
<P>
   There are several proposed bills in the Texas Legislature to
fund experimental voucher programs whereby students from
poor-performing public schools in select urban districts could
receive vouchers to finance their education at other public or
private schools of their choosing. Tony Garrett, chief of staff to
state Rep. Domingo Garcia, D-Dallas, forecasts that vouchers could
become the ``No. 1 emotional and headline-grabbing issue'' in
Austin, the state capital.
</P>
<P>
   The push for vouchers clearly has gained political momentum. But
no matter how hard I try, I just can't get comfortable with the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   I know that many thousands of students in Texas public schools
have failed to get a good education. I know that, as a parent, I
would be quite frustrated _ probably to the point of tears _ if I
had a child performing poorly in a public school of weak academic
standing.
</P>
<P>
   But vouchers aren't the panacea. If we've got problems with our
public schools, let's focus on fixing them instead of quitting on
them.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some obvious measures:
</P>
<P>
   _Let's raise pay for Texas public school teachers to at least
the national average (it now ranks 38th among the 50 states in
teacher pay).
</P>
<P>
   _Let's keep insisting, as has Gov. George W. Bush, on much more
accountability from public school students and educators. In recent
years, we've escalated accountability in numerous ways, from having
students take the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills tests to
rating schools' academic standing from exemplary to low-performing.
Now Bush is pushing for a major reduction in ``social promotion''
of students (the practice of advancing students to the next grade
even if they bomb academically). I'm all for the guv on that one.
</P>
<P>
   Because we are insisting on more accountability, Texas public
school students have ranked near the top nationally in the 1990s in
terms of the degree of improvement in academic performance. And the
number of schools rated ``low-performing'' has plunged.
</P>
<P>
   _Let's keep employing flexible, common-sense measures to target
specific problems. For example, many school districts are granting
sizable bonuses to teachers who gain certification in math, science
or bilingual education _ areas in which the teacher shortage has
been most critical.
</P>
<P>
   _Let's make sure we have adequate school facilities _ not fancy,
but adequate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _Let's take note of the fact that many public school students
are getting an excellent education. And it's not just public school
teachers and administrators who might be at fault when a student
fails. Many parents show virtually zero interest in their
children's education. Many students show little self-motivation and
might fail just as miserably in a private school.
</P>
<P>
   Now, back to vouchers, or the routing of public money to private
schools. A majority of private schools have a religious
orientation. Whatever happened to the cherished American principle
of separation of church and state?
</P>
<P>
   Public money should go to public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The private schools should take care of the private schools.

 &HT;    NEW HEIR TO JORDANIAN THRONE MAY HAVE HUSSEIN'S FLARE FOR DRAMA
 &HT;    EDs: Optional add begins at 500 words.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ No one expected him to ever be heir to the
throne when Jordan's Crown Prince Abdullah got married in 1993. But
he did give his guests something to remember: An army buddy
parachuted into the palace garden and cut the wedding cake with a
sword.
</P>
<P>
   This week, amid congratulatory visits by international
dignitaries as varied as U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
to the son of Libyan leader Moammar Khaddafi, the 37-year-old
prince had clearly not come down to earth himself.
</P>
<P>
   The visits are a sign that Jordan is a key to maintaining peace
in the region. And, while the little country is not named after the
recently-retired American basketball star, there's a lot of
commotion around the new ``Heir Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   For starters, people who like him claim that they know him well,
yet not much at all. They cite his long record of army service and
dedication to his country, but they say they don't know what he
thinks about Iraq, or Israel, or democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Educated mostly in the United States and England, he speaks
excellent English. He also speaks street Arabic. But his classic
Arabic, a difficult form used in writing and for official speeches,
is noticeably weak.
</P>
<P>
   The big question will be how much time he has to brush up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs time. He is open-minded. Personally, he is
acceptable,'' said former Jordanian Prime Minister Ahmad Obeidat.
But, he did not hazard to guess what kind of policies he would
have: ``He has no precedents.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah's father Hussein is the king, but he has cancer and
last week he shocked his little desert kingdom by moving aside the
brother who had been heir for 33 years. He appointed Abdullah in
his place.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah was sworn into the new job of crown prince at the
airport, as Hussein, propped on a cane, headed back to the United
States for another series of radiation treatments.
</P>
<P>
   There was palace politics behind the move. Hussein wrote in a
letter to the former Crown Prince Hassan that ``parasites'' were
sewing discord among family members. Also, the King had long been
thought to favor Abdullah's little half-brother for the job, but he
is only 18 and too young to be next in line behind such a sick
king.
</P>
<P>
   But, there as a traditional logic in the choice of Abdullah. The
first son is supposed to inherit the throne. In a male-dominated
culture, Arab men are referred to by the names of their first sons.
Hussein is Abu Abdullah -- father of Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   In an October interview with an Arabic London daily, Abdullah
said he loves it when his people call his father that.
</P>
<P>
   Both me love racing cars and flying airplanes. They attended the
Royal Academy at Sandhurst, a military school in England. Abdullah
is a general in the Jordanian army, a paratrooper and head of a
special forces unit. They are both known for their charm and touch
with the common man.
</P>
<P>
   In classes at Georgetown University, Abdullah studied under an
Israeli professor, long before his country made peace with Israel.
Newspapers in Israel reported last week that he was an excellent
student.
</P>
<P>
   But, he also had a playboy image in his youth -- as did Hussein,
who has married four times.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah was married that day in 1993, to Princess Rania, a
Palestinian. More than half the Jordanian population is
Palestinian. The prospect that she could be queen set off an odd
round of gossip in a country always heavily influenced by
outsiders. Hussein's wife was born in the United States. The
displaced Hassan is married to a Pakistani and people debated
whether a Palestinian queen would be preferable.
</P>
<P>
   In a picture published of the prince's family, Rania wore blue
jeans and he had snakeskin boots. With them were their children,
2-year-old Princess Iman and the first born son, 6-year-old Prince
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   While the elder Hussein ails in Minnesota, he consults with
Abdullah, who is in charge back home. He faces a host of problems,
with the Jordanian economy in shambles, a peace treaty with Israel
that is highly unpopular with the Jordanian people, and the United
States pounding Jordan's neighbor and former ally, Iraq, with air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   As Abdullah waited last Thursday for Secretary of State Albright
to drive away after their brief meeting, he paced nervously at the
top of the palace steps. The short, stocky prince, occasionally
paused in a military stance, feet together, hands behind his back.
But, he wore a blue business suit and a broad smile.

CLINTON AIMS AT GENERATION X IN BUDGET PLAN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Monday touted his $1.77
trillion blueprint for federal spending and its bailouts for Social
Security and Medicare as relief for Generation X, which faces the
risk of high federal taxes to subsidize the retirement of baby
boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Fleshing out proposals for fiscal 2000 that were sketched in his
Jan. 19 State of the Union address, Clinton urged the
Republican-led Congress to begin devoting the projected $4.4
trillion budget surplus over the next 15 years to ``progressive but
prudent'' investments to enable Americans in their 20s and 30s to
meet the ``challenges of their times ... unburdened by the
unfinished business of the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told an invited audience in the East Room of the White
House that it is ``profoundly important'' that Americans ``see this
budget not just as the budget that saves Social Security and
Medicare, but the budget that ensures for young Americans the same
chance ... to meet the challenges that they will have to face that
we don't know yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in Congress denounced many provisions in the
Clinton proposal, saying that the brunt of budget surpluses should
be used for tax cuts. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete V.
Domenici, R-N.M., said that ``big government has been reborn and
reinvented in this budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan includes $34 billion in tax cuts over five years,
$39 billion in increased spending over the current fiscal year and
projects a record $117 billion surplus. He seeks $82 billion in
increased taxes over the next five years, including a
55-cent-per-pack increase on cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The cigarette tax would raise $53.4 billion over five years to
help pay the federal government's costs for treating
smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton described the appeal of his budget proposals to young
adults shortly after former White House intern Monica Lewinsky
began her sworn testimony before House prosecutors handling the
president's impeachment trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not mention Lewinsky, 25, by name. But many of the
proposals outlined in his budget appeared designed to appeal to the
45 million Americans who were born between 1965 and 1980 _ the
so-called Generation X.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton budget would:
</P>
<P>
   _ Devote $2.7 trillion, or 62 percent of the projected $4.4
trillion federal budget surplus over the next 15 years, to rescuing
the financially ailing Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   The politically popular retirement program, created in 1935
during the depths of the Great Depression, provides $393 billion to
44 million beneficiaries each year. But the looming retirement of
the first of the 76 million post-World War II baby-boom generation
in 2011 means that receipts from payroll taxes and interest will
begin to fall short of benefit obligations for an expanding elderly
population.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his rescue plan would prolong solvency until 2055.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we take care of this, then when the baby boom retires, our
children will have their incomes to invest in their lives and the
lives of our grandchildren,'' Clinton explained.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton faces an uphill political struggle with his proposal to
invest about $700 billion of the diverted federal surplus in the
stock market to generate additional revenue for Social Security.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and GOP leaders on Capitol
Hill have voiced skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ease potential financial burdens on younger Americans by
bolstering the Medicare system that provides health care insurance
for people age 65 and older. Clinton seeks to set aside 15 percent
of the federal budget surplus over the next 15 years, or about $660
billion, to prolong the solvency of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also wants to permit people between ages 55 and 62 to
buy into Medicare if they lose health insurance coverage from a
private employer, as well as allow anyone between 62 and 65 to buy
into the program.
</P>
<P>
   _ Boost savings with a proposed Universal Savings Account (USA
Account) that would enable employees to contribute pre-tax dollars
to a self-directed retirement investment account that would be
matched on a sliding scale by the federal government. Clinton wants
to devote 11 percent of the projected $4.4 trillion surplus _ or
about $500 billion _ to pay the government's share of the program.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cut from five to three years the amount of time that an
employee needs to become vested in an employer-matching 401(k)
program or other retirement plans to help protect younger workers
who change jobs frequently.
</P>
<P>
   _ Provide a $250 tax credit for parents who stay at home with
children under age 1 and a $1,000 tax credit for people who care
for dependents with long-term illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seek federal subsidies to underwrite $22 billion in school
construction and modernization bonds to ease classroom
overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his bid to prolong the solvency of Social Security
and Medicare would ease the financial burdens of younger Americans
by reducing the burden of financing the nation's $5.5 trillion
national debt.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government currently pays about $235 billion in
interest annually on the debt _ or about 11 cents of every tax
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   White House budget director Jack Lew said Clinton's budget
blueprint would cut projected debt costs to just 2 cents out of
every federal tax dollar in 2014.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, citing the risk that the global financial crisis might
slam into the robust American economy, said reducing the long-term
financial burdens facing younger Americans will help bolster the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we're doing for our kids,'' Clinton said,
adding that his plan will ``guarantee them an economy of continuing
enduring stability and a hedge against the storms that may happen
beyond our borders.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget proposal offers the nation's 1.4 million armed
forces an immediate 4.4 percent pay raise with additional pay hikes
over the next five years _ a White House bid to respond to
complaints from enlisted personnel between the ages of 18 and 34.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also would allow students and new graduates to
deduct interest on student loans for the life of the loan _
typically 10 to 20 years _ rather than only the five years of
deductions currently allowed.

</P>
<P>
   Republicans on Capitol Hill voiced support and criticism of
Clinton's plan _ a road map for federal spending in the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1 that will be fought over by the White House and
Congress for the next eight months.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., applauded Clinton for
setting aside money in the projected budget surplus for shoring up
the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   But Hastert faulted Clinton for spending the rest of the
anticipated surplus on ``Washington-based programs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We see the surplus as an overpayment by American taxpayers,''
Hastert said. ``We believe that some of this overpayment should go
back to the taxpayers in the form of tax relief.''
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, slammed Clinton's
budget for using $1 trillion in projected surplus money for new
programs rather than tax cuts. Armey said he wants to use the
surplus to cut every tax _ except the Social Security payroll tax _
by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's willing to see you and me overcharged for each of the
next 15 years, but he doesn't want to give us a refund,'' Armey
said. ``It belongs to the American people. We earned it, we paid
it. And it's ours.''

 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Victoria and Albert Museum has not been a happy
house in recent years. It was thrown into disarray in 1988 when
eight senior curators were dismissed overnight as part of a
management shake-up. It was deluged with bad publicity when it
introduced admission charges in 1996. And more recently it has been
under attack from traditionalists for backing an adventurous scheme
to add an ultramodern extension to its late 19th-century red brick
building.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's troubles did not end there. After some National
Lottery profits were assigned to arts projects in the mid-1990s,
the Tate Gallery, the British Museum and the Royal Opera House
quickly won financing for expensive expansions and renovations.
When it was the Victoria and Albert's turn to seek funds, it was
turned down, not only for its avant-garde extension but initially
also for renovation of its British Galleries. Understandably, it
began to seem like the Cinderella of South Kensington.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, the V&AMP;A, as it is widely known, finally got a
break: The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea unexpectedly
authorized construction of the proposed extension, known as the
Spiral, that had provoked such a storm of criticism.
</P>
<P>
   In one daring decision, approved by eight votes to four and
overruling a recommended rejection by planning officers, the
council gave a huge boost for modern architecture in London and a
much-needed vote of confidence for the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a good omen,'' said Alan Borg, who became the
museum's director in the fall of 1995 after running the Imperial
War Museum. ``We benefited from the feeling that it was time
Britain did something in architecture. But it was also recognition
that we are a dynamic museum, with lots of things that other
museums don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   On that, there is no debate. The V&AMP;A has the world's largest
collection of applied and decorative arts, spanning 2,000 years and
embracing ceramics, metalwork, jewelry, furniture and textiles.
</P>
<P>
   Its 4 million art objects, of which only 20 percent can be shown
in its 12 acres and seven miles of galleries, also include
sculptures, paintings (among them, the priceless Raphael tapestry
Cartoons), drawings, prints and photographs. And as home to the
National Art Library, it is a respected research center and
publisher of art books.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in an era when museums compete more with blockbusters than
with scholarship, the V&AMP;A is bound to struggle for media attention.
It regularly puts on original shows of design through the ages, but
these cannot compete in glamour _ or attendance numbers _ with,
say, the recent Cezanne and the coming Jackson Pollock
retrospectives at the Tate Gallery or the current crowd-pleaser,
``Monet in the 20th Century,'' at the Royal Academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to refocus the public perception by showing that this
museum is part of the contemporary world,'' said Borg, a
57-year-old art historian, in a recent interview. ``And we aim to
do this more visibly and with a higher profile.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the museum began to do so with ``Cutting Edge,'' a
1997 show of avant-garde fashion that drew 230,000 visitors. The
museum will also present ``Design and the Digital Age'' this summer
and ``brand.new,'' a show about branding new products, next year.
Its main event in 2000 will be ``Art Nouveau 1890-1914,'' a major
exhibition on art and design that will travel to the National
Gallery of Art in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, of course, will identify the V&AMP;A more with the 21st
century than construction of the Spiral, the ``tumbling boxes''
extension designed by the American architect Daniel Libeskind (who
has just completed the new Jewish Museum in Berlin). But there is a
catch: If the V&AMP;A is to have any hope of raising the $110 million
needed to build the Spiral from lottery grants and private
contributions, it must first polish its image.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, it began this ``profile-building,'' as Borg puts
it, in North America in 1997 with an ambitious exhibition, ``Grand
Design: The Art of the Victoria and Albert Museum,'' organized and
presented first by the Baltimore Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   The show has traveled to Boston, Toronto and Houston, and it
will be seen at the Fine Arts Museums in San Francisco from Feb. 13
through May 9. Its final stop will be the V&AMP;A itself, for a
three-month display starting on Oct. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond presenting a selection of prized objects in a way that
illustrates the museum's unusual history, ``Grand Design'' also
seeks to remind visitors that in the 19th century the V&AMP;A served as
a role model for many American museums, including those of
Baltimore, Boston, and Brooklyn, N.Y. ``The idea was to use the
museum as an overtly educational instrument, to teach art and
design, to be useful, to do something for the public,'' Borg said.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, in creating the Museum of Manufactures in 1852, just
after the Great Exhibition of 1851, the government saw it
principally as a way of raising the standards of British design in
the context of the Industrial Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Its educational role was added by its founding director, Henry
Cole, who saw the museum being ``elevated from being a mere
unintelligible lounge for idlers into an impressive schoolroom for
everyone.'' Renamed the South Kensington Museum, it opened on its
present site on the corner of Exhibition Road and Cromwell Road in
1857.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But by May 1899, when Queen Victoria gave the museum its present
name in memory of her consort, the V&AMP;A had lost its populist touch.
``It had become more of an ivory tower, an elitist center of
scholarship, a display for people who already knew what they wanted
to see,'' Borg said. Even now, while the V&AMP;A has many fervent
admirers, a good many Londoners stay away, believing erroneously
that it is a museum of Victorian art.
</P>
<P>
   In looking to the future, Borg has therefore sought inspiration
in the museum's earliest years. ``When the V&AMP;A was founded, they
did what we're thinking of doing now,'' he said. ``Our focus should
return to our original mission. It is to help and be part of the
creative industries of today. I think the museum should be trying
to lead taste, to show people what is good design from the past and
the present. We should take some risks; we can even say, `This will
be the next big thing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the museum is not yet out of the woods. It carries some
of the scars of the decision by the former director, Elizabeth
Esteve-Coll, to revamp _ some would say destroy _ the curatorial
staff in 1988 in the name of breaking up what she called
``fiefdoms.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reforms knocked the stuffing out of the curators,'' said
Anna Somers Cocks, the editor of The Art Newspaper, who worked as a
curator in the V&AMP;A from 1973 to 1986. ``Something had to be done,
but it was just done in the wrong way.''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Bindman, a curator who began working at the museum
just weeks before the shake-up, is more upbeat. In 1993, she left
the V&AMP;A and moved to New York, where she worked at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art through 1996. Now she is back in London working
freelance. ``The V&AMP;A has had a hard time recovering,'' she said,
``but I now see a more positive attitude, a noticeable improvement
from when I left, perhaps because the museum is going back to its
roots.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over admission charges, though, is not over. From
1985, visitors were asked to make voluntary contributions. When
Borg broke ranks with the Tate Gallery, the British Museum and the
National Gallery by charging an entrance fee of 5 pounds, or $8, he
blamed inadequate government financial support.
</P>
<P>
   But with museums measuring success by attendance figures, he
paid a price: Visitors to the V&AMP;A fell from about 1.4 million in
1995 to just over a million in 1997, with a 5 percent recovery in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, after the British Museum came close to charging
admission, the government finally promised funds to help museums
operate without charging. But the outlook is still confused.
Although the V&AMP;A charges an entrance fee to its building, it does
not sell tickets for special exhibitions, while other ``free''
London museums earn handsomely from ticket sales to blockbusters.
</P>
<P>
   Further, in the case of the V&AMP;A, it is not clear how much
compensation it will receive for ending admission charges.
</P>
<P>
   Borg clearly has plenty on his plate with managing the museum's
800-member staff and $65 million annual budget, promoting its new
contemporary image and finding the money for the $50 million
renovation and reorganization of the British Galleries. (The
Heritage Lottery Fund finally came through with a $25 million
grant, but the V&AMP;A must find the rest.) As a result, many London
art experts believe that the Spiral is too ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   In a signed editorial in The Art Newspaper last July, before the
Spiral won building permission, Ms. Somers Cocks told Borg that ``a
general has to know when to retreat tactically in order to win the
campaign.'' While approving of the design, she said the museum
should finding better ways of spending its energy and ``not delude
itself that the Libeskind building would solve the attendance
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, Ms. Somers Cocks said that the Spiral, unlike
the British Galleries, was not indispensable. ``I have nothing
against the building, but the national lottery has already given
sums of money to major projects in London, and its policy thrust
now is toward smaller projects outside London,'' she said. ``So it
will be very difficult politically to give money for this
building.''
</P>
<P>
   Borg, though, is unfazed. He said that the success of the new
Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, had shown what modern
architecture can do for a city. He also noted that according to
polls commissioned by the V&AMP;A, public attitudes toward the Spiral
in London had gone from largely hostile to slightly favorable. The
building is also known to enjoy the approval of some members of
Prime Minister Tony Blair's Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as changing opinion resulted in planning permission,
we're not unhopeful that opinion will also swing the lottery
institutions,'' Borg said. ``The next 12 months are important
because we have momentum, we have support. Once we have the money,
it will take four years to build.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with lottery grants, though, he will still need private
donations. ``My initial aim with such a striking building is to
find someone to put their name on it, like Tate,'' he said. ``We
will happily do that _ for the right sum. In fact, I already have a
list of the 200 wealthiest people on earth, although there are some
constraints. Some of the people are perhaps not appropriate.'' He
smiled thinly and added, ``For example, I wouldn't want Saddam
Hussein's name on the building.''

GETTING USED TO GRANDEUR IN A QUIET VILLAGE OUTSIDE CARMEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For release Sunday, Feb. 7.) 
 (ms) 
 By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stretch of Route 1 that runs through Carmel, Calif., does
not inspire. A generation ago, the highway was the place where the
romance of the open road met the wild beauty of California's
central coast, but now the cars form an unbroken chain, and the
beleaguered motorist who turns east onto Carmel Valley Road runs
right into a big, fat shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   Press on, however, and the hubbub fades away. As the road climbs
into the Santa Lucia Range, it makes its way through Carmel Valley
Village and passes the little wineries that make up the Carmel
Valley appellation, California's tiniest. The looming, arid hills
begin to assert their power, and the Carmel River's silver thread
can be glimpsed far below, following the road. About 13 miles into
the hills, a very discreet turnoff leads to an iron gate that
guards the road to Stonepine.
</P>
<P>
   For travelers with a reservation, the mild anxiety of waiting
for the automatic gate to swing open is the last unpleasant moment
they will experience until, on leaving, they see the gate from the
other side. Like one of those plastic guns that attack static
cling, Stonepine, a resort and equestrian center that belongs to
the Relais and Chateau group, instantly eliminates stress, worry,
and feelings of low self-esteem simply by allowing its guests to
live, if only for a day or two, the life of the very, very rich.
</P>
<P>
   The estate is large. Together with the equestrian center,
formerly a thoroughbred training and breeding operation known as
the Double H Ranch, it covers more than 300 acres. At its center
stands Chateau Noel, a vaguely French-Italian villa with pinkish
walls and red tile roof that was built in the 1920s as a wedding
present for Henry Potter Russell and Helen Crocker, a member of the
Crocker banking dynasty. Since 1983, when the estate was purchased
and turned into a resort, their gracious style of living has been
available to the traveler with an urge to splurge.
</P>
<P>
   Stonepine is not priced for the faint of heart. The eight suites
in Chateau Noel range from $375 to $750 a night, and the three
private cottages on the grounds run from $750 to $2,500. The price
includes breakfast. It does not include a 10.5 percent hotel tax
and a 10 percent service charge.
</P>
<P>
   It helps to think of the steep tariff and the service charges
(18 percent is added to the dinner bill) as the price of admission
to a better way of life. Once inside the gate, you are rich. Your
house, reached by a narrow, winding half-mile road, is spacious and
elegant, surrounded by gardens, a waterfall, a small golf course, a
swimming pool and tennis courts. The fine gravel in the driveway
has the quiet, tasteful crunch that says money. You are cosseted by
staff members whose only desire is to please, and the no-tipping
policy removes any hint that money might be a motivating factor.
</P>
<P>
   On arriving at Stonepine, my wife, Nancy, and I found the place
in crisis mode. The first fall rains, sudden and violent, had
knocked out electricity to the area, and as we settled in, the
outlines of our room were blurring with the fading light. As
scurrying hotel employees placed small votive candles on the main
stairway and along the hallway outside our room, lending a magic
touch to the surroundings, the manager sent his minions into town
to stock up on flashlights. ``Make sure you pour plenty of wine
tonight,'' I heard him whisper to a waiter.
</P>
<P>
   All rooms at Stonepine have a theme. The $400 Wedgwood Suite,
for example, has a soft-blue color scheme, and a chaise longue. The
intriguing-sounding Don Quixote, reached through concealed doors in
the first-floor library, comes with a separate sitting room, two
bathrooms and direct access to a secluded garden patio. (Porcelain
figurines of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza take care of the theme.)
At $500 a night, we had taken the Chanel Suite, an expansive
chamber decorated in gray. The gray satin covers on the two double
beds and the heavy gray curtains gave off a pearlescent glow. The
floral-patterned wallpaper was a muted beige-and-gray. Very
soothing.
</P>
<P>
   Off in one corner, a round table continued the theme. It
supported a coffee-table book with the title ``Les Bijoux de
Chanel'' and two framed photographs of Coco herself, along with a
plate filled with fruit and cheese, and a half-bottle of wine
labeled Chateau Noel.
</P>
<P>
   The wine, a 1993 cabernet made for the resort by nearby Durney
Vineyards, was very attractive, but the pear was tough, the
strawberries tasteless, and the crackers stale. The decor was hit
and miss too. A less than stunning Monet reproduction hung on one
wall, a feeble print in the manner of Toulouse-Lautrec over the
fireplace. When the electricity came back on a few hours after our
arrival, the bathroom chandelier cast its sparkling light on a
plastic wastebasket that could have come from Woolworth's.
</P>
<P>
   While they surprised us, these false notes did little to disturb
the overall effect of grand luxe. The large bathroom, equipped with
plenty of mirrors at all the right heights, included a bathtub with
Jacuzzi, a separate shower and a fancy amenities basket filled with
Crabtree &AMP; Evelyn products, all of them containing jojoba oil,
which seems to be the ingredient of the moment. A fireplace, well
stocked with dry firewood, provided both warmth and atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Through the tall French windows, we looked over a lawn and
gardens bordered by colossal stone pines, evenly spaced like
sentries. Beyond the trees were wooded hills that, in the
crystalline air, seemed to lie within arm's reach. The stone pines
were fascinating. Stern and totemic, they were covered in bark that
looked like rectangular leather plates. Attached to the plates were
acorn woodpeckers, dashing fellows with black-and-white bodies and
swept-back red coifs that methodically drilled round holes, each of
which they then stuffed with a nut, turning each tree into a
savings bank. The jackhammer pounding of the red-headed woodpecker
was not for them. These birds did quality work, tapping lightly and
intermittently, like a cobbler working on an expensive shoe.

<P>
   Less welcome was the plaintive yowl of a small cat with
puffed-out black fur and lamplike yellow eyes that had become
stranded on the roof. The concierge, risking life and limb, stepped
out on the tiles in an effort to bag the beast, which simply shrank
a little further into the rooftop vegetation. We ended up trying to
buy silence by placing tidbits of food on the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Guests in search of nothing more than solitude and fresh air can
find both at Stonepine. They can loaf in the nooks and crannies of
the hotel (the colonnaded walkway overlooking the back lawn is
prime territory), enjoy the gardens, or, with the resort's color
map in hand, wander the hiking trails that wind along the
surrounding hills and ridges, so fragrant with wildflowers that a
puff of wind unleashes a honey-scented wave. A quick browse through
the guest book can be entertaining too. Bill Gates has breezed
through the week before we stayed (``Thanks!'' was written in an
extrovert's bold hand), and so has Warren Buffett. One's peers, in
other words.
</P>
<P>
   Energetic guests, especially horse enthusiasts, can take
advantage of the equestrian center. The old Double H Ranch, created
in the 1930s, was California's first center for breeding and
training thoroughbreds. Among its graduates were Majestic Prince,
winner of the 1969 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. There's
still a little three-furlong race track for workouts, and spacious
riding rings where for $35 an hour three trainers give lessons in
trail riding, English saddle, Western saddle, jumping, and carriage
driving and sulky driving. The resident horses appreciate a scratch
behind the ears. One pair, honey-colored twins with long blond
bangs, brought a touch of glamour to the stock, like equine Gabor
sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the horses are available for trail riding, and we were
both keen to take a riding lesson and perhaps head out on the
trail. Alas, the cowgirls at the equestrian center told us, the
rains had made the paths too slippery, creating a ``potential
liability situation.'' Was this how the West was won?
</P>
<P>
   It was too cold to swim, and neither of us plays tennis. Croquet
was an option, but in the end we reached for a quiver of arrows and
a couple of bows and headed for the archery range. Movie fans may
recall the climactic moment when Robin Hood, seemingly defeated
when his rival hits the bull's-eye, releases a shot that splits the
offending arrow in two. It's harder than it looks.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, guests assemble in the drawing room for
champagne and canapes, prelude to the evening meal, which is served
on two long tables in the dining room. On the night we had dinner,
the diners at table No. 1 quickly became a well-disciplined unit
bent on high-volume hilarity. Table No. 2 accommodated a Swedish
couple at one end, and, many yards out of speaking range, Nancy and
me at the other. It was a quiet meal.
</P>
<P>
   By New York restaurant standards, the cooking was good but not
exceptional. The $65 fixed-price dinner began with an innocuous
vegetable consomme, then picked up momentum with a salad of mixed
greens, walnuts and apples, dressed with a champagne vinaigrette.
The pan-seared tenderloin, served with rosti potatoes, was
fork-tender and succulent, the duck breast in port wine sauce
richly satisfying. The third choice, sauteed sea scallops with a
lemon cream sauce, had been exhausted by the roisterers at Table 1.
Dessert was a fine lemon souffle with raspberry sauce, followed by
cheeses.
</P>
<P>
   The wine list, heavy on California wines, especially local
producers like Durney, Jekel and Chalone, was modestly priced, with
most bottles falling in the $35 to $65 range.
</P>
<P>
   The choicest duck scraps went straight to the roof. Even for a
stray cat, it's only the best at Stonepine.
</P>
<P>
   Stonepine is at 150 East Carmel Valley Rd., Carmel Valley,
Calif. 93924; (831) 659-2245, fax (831) 659-5160. Prices for suites
and cottages range from $375 to $2,500 a day, breakfast included.

amenities for the crew, like televisions in almost every berth.
What the Navy cannot put aboard the Truman is a full crew. The
ship, commissioned by Clinton last July to join the nation's other
carriers, is not alone. Two weeks ago, the Navy disclosed that it
has had as many as 22,000 empty positions, or billets, in a force

NEW POLICE CHIEF FIGHTS CRIME WITHIN HIS OWN FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico _ In the past month, Moctezuma Rodriguez
has gone from working security in Las Vegas to riding herd over a
border city police force plagued by corruption, scandal and the
arrest of 12 officers for attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking over as Nuevo Laredo police chief Jan. 1, Rodriguez
has fired more than 120 officers _ roughly 25 percent of the force
_ and all six of his commanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible we've arrived at this point; we can't even
believe it,'' Rodriguez, 49, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to regain the respect of the city,'' the Nuevo
Laredo native continued. ``People are fed up with what has been
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, officers not only have been able to shake down
people for bribes, but have been bought or intimidated by rival
drug cartels competing to ship marijuana or cocaine across the Rio
Grande and into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, 12 officers were arrested and charged with
attempted murder for attacking a police officer from another city.
The officer was critically wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be narcotics trafficking,'' Rodriguez said. ``What
else could it be?''
</P>
<P>
   In October, two officers were kidnapped and haven't been seen
since.
</P>
<P>
   In December, two others, including the son of an ex-commander,
were killed when AK-47 fire shredded their Volkswagen beetle patrol
car. Each officer was hit more than a dozen times, investigators
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To kidnap police, to murder police, this shows what is going
on,'' Rodriguez said. ``There has been no respect for the law or
fear of the police.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials believe this city of about 400,000 people is caught in
a battle between the Arrellano Felix cartel, based in Tijuana, and
the cartel of the late Amado Carrillo Fuentes, which is based in
Ciudad Juarez.
</P>
<P>
   From his first day on the job, Rodriguez has made his terms
known to the police: Be professional and enforce the law, or be
fired or jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Before being hired in Nuevo Laredo, he was part of the security
detail at the Binon's Horseshoe Hotel and Casino, one of downtown
Las Vegas' most-storied clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in Nuevo Laredo vow to reform the city's corrupt image.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking to change everything,'' Councilman Eliseo Huerta
said. ``The principal issue here is public security.''
</P>
<P>
   Council members also are considering ways to provide more money
for a police force that is so poor, some officers don't have guns.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez hopes to rebuild the force with a fresh batch of
recruits scheduled to enter the police academy this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for people who want to serve for the right
reasons: To enforce the law and serve Nuevo Laredo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the city's new mayor, Horacio Garza, who took office the
same day as Rodriguez, is appealing to the federal government to
send more drug-enforcement agents to combat the cartels and help
keep the streets safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we live in fear we will never advance,'' Garza told a news
conference last week. ``I'm tranquil. Justice is on our side.''

THE TRAVELER'S CYBER-COMPANION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
  
( Attn: Calif., Mass., N.Y., Texas)   (af)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Johan Reinhard called a friend in Texas recently to chat
from near the top of the world. A high-altitude anthropologist
whose explorations in the Andes and Himalayas often appear in
National Geographic, Reinhard was standing at the summit of a
20,000-foot mountain in Peru, using a new kind of telephone that
beams conversation from virtually anywhere on earth to a
constellation of low-orbit satellites and back down to terrestrial
wired and wireless phone networks.
</P>
<P>
   Had he wished to (and had he the stamina to carry all the gear
up the mountain), he could have snapped a picture of himself with a
digital camera, attached it to a lightweight portable computer, and
sent the image halfway across the planet as electronic mail via
satellite phone over the Internet _ an instant, electronic postcard
from the new era of travel.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is transforming travel not just for explorers in
remote corners of the world, but also for families packing the
minivan for a drive to Grandma's house, and for the travel industry
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Technically savvy consumers have been able to research travel
destinations and make airline reservations from home for more than
a decade using personal computers and early online information
services such as Compuserve. But since the mid-1990s, declining
computer prices and the rapid growth of the Internet have caused an
almost unimaginable proliferation of online travel information
sites and services, all available from the comfort of home.
</P>
<P>
   Computer chips allow people to research trips, shop for the
lowest fares, reserve airline tickets, look inside hotel rooms from
thousands of miles away, get detailed maps, check train schedules,
chat electronically with other travelers familiar with the
destination, order travel guides, create custom itineraries, buy
luggage, watch video travelogues on a VCR, check detailed weather
reports, compare exchange rates, research restaurants, peer through
remote cameras to see what the weather is like right now in Seattle
or Antarctica, study a foreign language and book tickets to local
cultural and sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a trip never sounded so exhausting.
</P>
<P>
   Like the telegraph and telephone before it, the Internet was
supposed to reduce the need to travel. As technology makes the
world a smaller place, people are traveling more, not less. This is
partly because technology makes travel more convenient, but also
because it stirs the user's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important difference about cyberspace is that there
is no distance between two points,'' said Paul Saffo, a director at
the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif. ``The Internet
gives people these marvelous electronic seven-league boots that can
drop them into Katmandu, and once they visit Katmandu
electronically, it is going to make them curious. When people visit
somewhere electronically, they want to go there on purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The travel industry is helping to push consumers toward
computers and Internet services. Last month, Delta Air Lines
imposed a $2 round-trip surcharge on domestic tickets not purchased
through its Web site. (The surcharge, sharply criticized by travel
agents, was withdrawn two weeks later.)
</P>
<P>
   In a slight variation, American Airlines, to name one,
occasionally gives discounts on tickets purchased via computer.
Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air recently imposed a $10 surcharge
for mailing paper tickets. Other airlines have been studying
similar inducements, to the consternation of travel agents and some
travelers without Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines contend that the shift to Internet reservations and
ticketing will help them cut costs by reducing staff and increasing
productivity, although such pronouncements often do not mention the
need to hire more highly paid programmers and Web designers.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet offers the airlines, which have been cutting
commissions to travel agents in recent years, a way to further
reduce commissions and the cost of distributing tickets. In any
event, Delta announced record profits the week after imposing the
surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on whom one asks and how one counts, travel is the
biggest, or one of the biggest, categories of spending by online
consumers. Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., estimates that
total spending for online travel bookings last year, counting
airlines, hotels, rental cars, tours and cruises, was $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of future bookings vary, but Fiona Swerdlow, a digital
commerce analyst at Jupiter Communications in New York, said the
research company predicted in April that online leisure travel
spending by consumers would rocket to $11.7 billion by the year
2002.
</P>
<P>
   The figure does not include business travel booked through
corporate travel agencies, and the increased presence of cruise and
tour companies offering bookings on the Web recently may make the
total even higher, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Travel-specific sites on the World Wide Web are reporting surges
of visitors, as consumers become more comfortable researching
trips, buying tickets and reserving rooms on line. According to NPD
Online Research, a division of NPD Group in Port Washington, N.Y.,
nearly 70 percent of Web users _ and there are more than 70 million
in America alone, according to some studies _ say they have visited
a travel-related site at some time. Among computer users who travel
frequently, the Web is already as indispensable as a suitcase and a
toothbrush.
</P>
<P>
   One site, Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), reports that it has
more than five million registered users. Preview Travel
(www.previewtravel.com) claims six million. Microsoft's Expedia
(www.expedia.msn.com), which recently reported more than $10
million in weekly travel sales _ car, air and hotel only _ claims
more than four million registered users in the United States and
Canada. America Online, with more than 15 million subscribers, is
adding a new section for business travelers later this month.
Leisure travel is already one of the most popular topics among
AOL's subscribers, said Pam McGraw, a company spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   There are hundreds of smaller Internet sites and online
information services. Many of them are maintained as hobbies or
public services by travel enthusiasts, but in the past two years
corporate behemoths have been willing to spend tens of millions of
dollars on elaborate sites and E-commerce systems in the belief
that profits will eventually accrue. So far, spending is still
outpacing revenue, services like Expedia and Travelocity say.
</P>
<P>
   The allure of such sites is that they give the traveler direct
access to the same information available to travel agents. Like
most travel agencies, these online services are free _ other than
the cost of the Internet connection. While it is true that the
personal relationship with a travel agent is lost, there are other
compensations.
</P>
<P>
   Some automated systems today can notify travelers by pager the
minute a flight schedule or gate is changed, or by electronic mail
when special fares appear for favorite airline routes. A Web-savvy
younger generation and others who have embraced the new technology
relish fending for themselves. As a result, some analysts
anticipate that the traditional travel agency will eventually
become an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   Smart virtual agents, perhaps overseen by smart human travel
agents, will someday roam the Internet armed with a dossier of a
client's personal and price preferences, said Andrew B. Whinston, a
professor of information systems at the University of Texas at
Austin, whose expertise is electronic commerce. The software
agents, Whinston said, could quickly construct a comprehensive and
complex itinerary of air tickets, hotels, rental cars, restaurant
reservations, theater tickets, shopping discounts, sightseeing
schedules, reading lists, baby-sitting services, and so on _ all
for a predetermined budget.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has been trapped in an endless loop of a voice mail
system, trying to connect with a human, knows that technology often
does not work as well as it could, and could definitely be made
easier. The Web is no different.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate NPD survey, conducted in October with five major
airlines, only 18 percent of the airline site visitors polled said
they could always find the information they sought.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and other major travel site operators are scrambling
to make their services more convenient, by reducing the number of
mouse clicks needed to get a fare quote, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Computerized baggage handling, ticket-taking and freight-routing
systems installed at some new airports (Denver, Hong Kong) and
train stations (Berlin) in recent years have caused more delays
initially than they have prevented. Car-based navigation and
mapping systems occasionally lead drivers into dead ends, or, in
the case of an unfortunate German couple traveling in a rental car
at night, to bridges that are not there. (They got wet.)
</P>
<P>
   On general Internet sites like America Online or Yahoo, clicking
on the ``travel'' button on screen will present the user with
hundreds of topics, often organized into specific groups and
sometimes focused with astonishing specificity: travel information
for seniors, for backpackers, for motorcyclists and so on.
</P>
<P>
   On a site maintained by the travel book publisher Rough Guides
(www.roughguides.com), a recent topic was proper etiquette for
being thrashed with twigs by friendly strangers in a Finnish sauna
_ not the typical information one would get from a local travel
agent.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the sites offer chat services and bulletin boards. Chat
services allow the user to converse on screen with one or more
people, anywhere in the world, at the same time. Bulletin boards
are used to post questions or comments that others can read and
respond to at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the commentary is banal, but occasionally the exchanges
yield valuable, first-hand (if unsubstantiated) information _ avoid
hotel X, don't miss restaurant Y, and Z is the cheapest place to
rent gear. It is not unheard of for people to forge friendships in
such forums.
</P>
<P>
   Although fax machines still appear to be more popular in some
parts of the world _ typically where the postal systems are
unreliable _ the Internet is invaluable for making reservations.
Electronic mail is not a slave to time zones, and in preparing for
a recent trip to Italy I discovered that my fractured Italian
translated better in electronic mail than it did over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the Internet surprises even technology aficionados
like me. A small hotel where I vacationed in the remote Cinque
Terre region of Italy, a place largely inaccessible by automobile,
not only has Internet access but also its own Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Once in my room, however, I also discovered that while the hotel
staff might have e-mail, the concept of allowing guests to have
access to personal e-mail is still somewhat foreign. Hooking a
personal computer to the phone system in other Italian hotels I
visited was either impossible or more trouble than it was worth. On
the next trip I'll leave the computer home, and look for cafes that
serve Internet access along with gelato and cappuccino.
</P>
<P>
   For hikers, bikers and others who take the roads less traveled,
satellite technology makes it more difficult to get lost. The
planet is now circled by a necklace of Global Positioning System
(GPS) satellites that, when signaled by a hand-held receiver
anywhere on the globe, can provide the traveler's exact position,
velocity, speed and altitude.
</P>
<P>
   With a CD-ROM or DVD drive in the computer, the traveler can
carry libraries' worth of information on a few shiny disks.
</P>
<P>
   Are these gadgets passing fads? The form and function of the
devices will certainly evolve, the computer and consumer
electronics industries have taught us, but the underlying idea of
ubiquitous and enhanced communication through computers is clearly
here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are beginning to install power outlets in their craft
to accommodate gadget-laden travelers, initially in the first-class
sections, but eventually throughout the cabin. Airborne gambling,
shopping and videoconferencing may all be ubiquitous in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels are trying to get smarter too, technically speaking,
offering automated check-in and check-out and an array of in-room
amenities for the connected traveler. The Westin Century Plaza
Hotel and Tower in Century City, Calif., in 1996 established a
``cybersuite'' with an electronic butler that responded _
erratically, some visitors reported _ to voice commands asking it
to turn on the stereo, open the drapes, draw a bath, and adjust the
room temperature. The butler, named Alexander, was removed last
year after requiring almost constant maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   But of course any system that relies on technology is subject to
disruption, and a widespread technology failure can disrupt travel
as much as a winter blizzard. The infamous Y2K bug, a programming
glitch that is expected to affect millions of computers and
embedded microprocessors in less than a year, is certain to disrupt
transportation systems when the calendar flips to Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   While the Y2K issue may dampen the enthusiasm of travelers
hoping to spend New Year's Eve away from home, only a small number
of extremists believe that it will cause more than a temporary
disruption. Meanwhile new technologies will inevitably emerge. Once
people establish communications with other people and places,
physical travel follows.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you hate airplanes, kill your computer,'' said Saffo, the
futurist. ``The simple fact is that over the past half century or
so, travel miles and telecommunications minutes have chased each
other upward. If you talk long enough, it is going to lead to
face-to-face meetings, and that usually means traveling. Then you
continue the conversation electronically between meetings.''

 &HT;    SOCIAL SECURITY SURPLUS TAPPED FOR SPENDING INCREASES
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's five-year budget released
Monday would use extra Social Security Trust funds to help finance
his plans for new domestic programs and increased military
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Despite expectations of huge surpluses down the road, the
government's operating budget next year is expected to continue to
run at a slight deficit of $12 billion, which would be borrowed
from the overpayment into the Social Security fund.
</P>
<P>
   During the full five-year period, the budget calls for using
$145 billion from the retirement fund surpluses to help pay for
increased spending in child-care subsidies, health care, education
and defense, said Carol Wait, president of the fiscal watchdog
group Committee for a Responsible Budget.
</P>
<P>
   Wait was among budget experts raising doubts about the rosy
fiscal picture painted by the Clinton budget, which assumes soaring
surpluses for the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our economic house is in order and strong,'' the president
said as he unveiled his spending and tax plan. ``If we manage the
surplus right we can uphold our responsibility to future
generations. We can do so by dedicating the lion's share of the
surplus to saving Social Security and Medicare and paying down the
national debt.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Wait said that the nation would reduce the debt much
faster without enacting the Clinton budget, or any other changes in
existing programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put the government on auto pilot, we would be buying
down the debt held by the public, because that's what the Treasury
does with surpluses,'' she said. ``He (the president) is proposing
to buy down less debt than we would under current law.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Reichauer, a former congressional budget director,
credited Clinton with reserving the ``great bulk'' of Social
Security surpluses for paying down the debt. But he also added,
``If I had my druthers, I certainly would like to see the Social
Security surpluses used exclusively to pay down the national debt
and delay tax cuts or spending initiatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some experts are far less sanguine than the White
House budgeteers, who predicated their plans on five more years of
an economic boom that is already the longest since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``No projected surpluses are secure,'' said Bradley Schiller, an
economist at American University. ``If the economy slides into
recession, those surpluses will disappear like mist when the sun
comes out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you assume the surpluses are real, then there's the
question of what really should be done with them,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the president asserts that he wants to save Social
Security first, the reality is that he's significantly increasing
domestic and military spending with this budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bixby, policy analyst with the Concord Coalition, a group
that is pushing for reforming Social Security's finances, said he
foresees difficult battles ahead in persuading the president and
Congress to use surpluses for reducing the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's politically much more attractive to say we're going to
return it to the taxpayers or use it to pay for Medicare drugs or
some other program,'' Bixby said. ``It doesn't make a very good
campaign slogan. But it appeals to people like me.''

 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ He is youthful, articulate and visionary, leader of a
nation in dramatic transition, with a compassionate vision and a
ruthless dedication to seeing it through. His name is Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   He is all style and fluff, a spiffy promoter with a preachy
speaking manner and a trendy tendency to put the possessive
``people's''' before the mention of any British institution and the
verb ``modernize'' in any sentence about his goals for the country.
His name is also Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty months after he led Britain's ``new'' Labor Party to
power, it is the first image of Britain's attention-getting
45-year-old prime minister that is prevailing _ much to the
consternation of his Conservative opponents, who have failed to put
across the second.
</P>
<P>
   But while he is the most popular prime minister in British
history and no one questions his extraordinary public appeal,
people are asking what is actually inside the enticingly wrapped
package he is offering.
</P>
<P>
   Blair says he is leading a ``radical'' 10-year project that will
free Britain from the grip of class consciousness, energize the
individual parts of the United Kingdom by yielding much of London's
authority over them, liberate British business from restrictions
that discourage enterprise and punish risk-taking, reduce the
poor's dependency on the state, and end Britain's estrangement from
the Continent and make it a leader in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Blair government's emphasis on presentation, or
``spin,'' has left it vulnerable to criticism that all this may
represent slick talk of accomplishment, and not solid
accomplishment itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``A gravity-defying victory of style over substance,'' is the
verdict of one critic, Boris Johnson, columnist for the
conservative Daily Telegraph. Blair's government, said Michael
Gove, a columnist for The Times of London, ``is about entrenching a
clique's hold on power, not advancing policies for the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The end-of-year list of achievements put out in December by 10
Downing Street included the peace settlement in Northern Ireland;
decisions to move regional power out of the Parliament in London to
newly created legislatures in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast;
reforming the House of Lords; setting a minimum wage; starting a
welfare-to-work program; granting independence to the Bank of
England in setting interest rates, and establishing Britain as a
more positive presence in Europe while maintaining strong ties to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   With a 179-seat majority in Parliament, ineffective opposition
from the Conservatives and only rumblings of discontent from
dissidents in his party, Blair has remarkable freedom of action,
and his presidential-style presence has become the most important
factor in New Labor's performance.
</P>
<P>
   As focus groups and opinion research become a growing force in
Britain, political muscle is increasingly measured with the tape
that shows the public popularity numbers. By this standard, Blair
is an outstanding success: His approval ratings are persisting in
mid-60s percentiles, the highest ever for a British prime minister
and 15 points higher than the ratings for his government. This is
occurring in spite of Cabinet scandals and disarray _ including the
resignation of his chief ally, Peter Mandelson _ of the kind that
contributed to the overwhelming rejection of his predecessor, John
Major, in the 1997 election.
</P>
<P>
   He has the support of 87 percent of the fractious Labor Party,
and recent polls indicate that even the Tory rank and file prefer
him to their own leader, William Hague. Although Blair heads the
country that Europeans most love to loathe for its reluctance to
join in their grand ventures like monetary union, he often comes
first even on the Continent in polls measuring the popularity of
individual leaders.
</P>
<P>
   He has gained favorable international notice for a formless and
airily defined theory about the divisions between individual and
state responsibilities called simply the Third Way. It seems to
maintain a following chiefly because he is the one who is peddling
it.
</P>
<P>
   At home, his government's purpose, Blair said in a recent policy
speech, is to serve a ``new, larger, more meritocratic middle
class,'' which now displays ``greater tolerance of difference,
ambition to succeed, greater opportunities to earn a decent
living.'' His congeniality goes down easily in today's Britain,
where attitudes are shaped more by consumerism than class.
</P>
<P>
   He put the Labor Party through a force-fed reformation in the
1990s, aimed at shedding the socialist ideology, tax and spending
habits and tribal in-fighting that had scared off middle-class
voters in past elections and given the Tories their dominance of
British politics.
</P>
<P>
   Outwardly, Blair has a glad-handing appeal. He is a
shirt-sleeves boss, trading jocular banter with his aides in his
back office at 10 Downing Street. But he is said to be steely when
it comes to internal discipline. During the push to transform the
party, insiders called his methods ``Stalinist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The odd thing about him is that no one thinks of him as
Machiavellian,'' said Robert Harris, the novelist, who is a fan of
the government. ``I suppose that is what is so Machiavellian about
him.''
</P>
<P>
   With an information-management policy keeping government
spokesmen resolutely ``on message,'' Blair holds to simple
definitions and repeated slogans. One of his favorites is that he
is not just running a government but heading up a ``project.''
</P>
<P>
   Projects need more than five years to fulfill, he and his
ministers stress, and it is an article of faith among the Blairites
that this government must overcome the curse of Labor's nearly
100-year-old history of never having run Britain for two successive
full five-year terms. The week after Labor's rout of the Tories on
May 1, 1997, members of the new government were already talking
about the urgency of winning the next election.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the ambitiousness of the political project is seen
in Blair's efforts to find areas of cooperation with the Liberal
Democrats, Britain's third party, and end century-old divisions on
Britain's left between the Labor and Liberal traditions.

 LONDON: Liberal traditions. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Labor's preoccupation with becoming consistently electable has
led critics to fault the Blair government for being overly cautious
and vague, more eager not to disaffect than to engage and lead. To
a certain extent, New Labor's success can be measured by what has
not happened as much as by what has.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first unfrightening Labor administration,'' said
Anthony King, professor of government at Essex University. Past
Labor governments are notorious in Britons' memories for economic
mismanagement, convulsive social clashes and raucous internal
wrangling. A main reason for the Blair government's success so far,
King said, is ``its conspicuous failure'' to do the wrong thing.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Blair's boldest move was to seize on a problem first
tackled by Prime Minister Major _ the intractable conflict in
Northern Ireland. While Major lacked the political clout to make
much tangible progress, Blair committed his carefully rationed
personal prestige to a successful outcome of the rancorous
negotiations by joining the talks himself and staying up all night
with the haggling negotiators last April to nail down the final
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Blair has created a New Deal program for getting jobs for youths
that has placed 50,000 unemployed in jobs in seven months. But in
other areas welfare reform has stalled, and steps to cut benefits
for single mothers have caused widespread resentment in a country
where ``welfare state'' is not a pejorative phrase.
</P>
<P>
   In education, Blair is meeting targets for reducing the class
sizes of primary schools, and in health he has succeeded in
lowering waiting lines. But he must find money to give teachers and
nurses needed raises, and he is continually embarrassed by
disclosures of failing schools and shortages of hospital beds.
</P>
<P>
   To keep his erstwhile trade union supporters on board, he pushed
through a minimum wage and moved to restore organizing rights,
though in both cases the terms were not as generous as the Labor
traditionalists had wished. Old Labor stalwarts are constantly
unhappy with Blair, but their power is greatly diminished, and they
have no other welcome port in the current landscape of British
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Blair has established close relations with the monarchy,
offering needed political guidance as it passed through the trauma
of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and reaching out to
Prince Charles, whose social concerns are surprisingly harmonious
with his own.
</P>
<P>
   His personal diplomacy has made relations with the Continent
less frosty, even though Blair kept Britain out of the launching of
the euro. The prime minister stresses at every opportunity that
Britain is a European country and increasingly hints that its
future destiny is in monetary union.
</P>
<P>
   The delicate task of educating a majority of Britons out of
their traditional hostility and suspicion toward Europe has been
made easier for him by the absolutist position of the Conservative
leader, Hague. He favors declaring now that Britain will not
consider entry into monetary union for at least eight years, a view
that Blair is able to mock without having to make a commitment of
his own.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the Exchequer, who steers the
economy and is the second-most powerful man in the government, is
charged with navigating Britain past what currently looks to be the
only threat to Blair's hold on British affections _ a year of
limited growth, or even mild recession. That could mark the end of
the country's current economic good health, which had its origins
in the last years of the Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The only bumps in the road that the purring New Labor machine
has been gliding along have been in an area of potential
vulnerability for this government _ the ethical conduct of its
ministers and the unity of their commitment to the prime minister's
program. These were two of the principal counts in the electoral
indictment of the Conservatives by Blair.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three months, four principals in his government have
walked the forced resignation plank that was a permanent feature of
the Major years. Among them was Mandelson, Blair's closest
confidant and as central an architect of New Labor as the prime
minister himself. He quit on Dec. 23 when he was found not to have
declared a $625,000 home loan from a colleague who was under
investigation by his Trade and Industry department.
</P>
<P>
   The departures and evidence that emerged of feuding within the
government posed a challenge to Blair's reputation for discipline
and control, and the scandal-starved British press gave the subject
ample coverage. But showing his bent for damage control, Blair
obtained resignations rapidly, in marked contrast to Major's
lingering response in similar situations.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the criticisms directed at Blair have been accusations
of lapses in style _ that he is a ``control freak,'' that he is
surrounded by ``cronies,'' that he is creating a ``nanny state.''
His foreign secretary, Robin Cook, was portrayed recently as a
womanizer and a heavy drinker in a vengeful book by the wife he
left for a younger woman in 1997, and newspapers have also raised
questions about the number of homosexuals in the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's partly to ward off boredom of Labor's unbreakable
domination that the politics of the personal holds such sway,''
commented Hugo Young, columnist for The Guardian.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll published in The Daily Telegraph this month showed
what the consequences were for Blair. His approval ratings went up
a point to 66.

ORTHODOX STUDENTS HARASS REFORM RABBIS AT THE WESTERN WALL  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Minn.)  By DEBORAH SONTAG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In an ugly confrontation 100 Orthodox yeshiva
students surrounded a group of American Reform rabbis who went to
pray at the Western Wall on Monday morning. The students booed
loudly and hurled insults past officers from the border police.
</P>
<P>
   What was most chilling to the Americans was that the youths,
their faces contorted in anger under their black hats, screamed
that the rabbis should ``go back to Germany,'' to be exterminated,
one explained later.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn to the protest by cars with loudspeakers that circulated
in their neighborhoods, the students jostled and pushed at metal
gates that essentially hemmed the 33 rabbis, men and women, in a
pen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are nothing but biological Jews,'' said an Orthodox
member of Parliament, Avraham Leizerson, who entered the pen to
yell at the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The clash was the latest skirmish in a war that has been heating
up between the Orthodox and the Reform and Conservative movements,
which many fundamentalists believe to be such a dilution of Judaism
that they are not the same religion at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think you are Jewish because you put on a kippa!'' or
skullcap, Meir Kraus, an Orthodox man, yelled in English. ``This is
like if I went to the Vatican with my prayer shawl. They'd find me
completely nuts. You want to do a new religion? Fine. Go do it
somewhere else, in Sri Lanka. Leave us Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   What the protesters found particularly provocative was the fact
that the men and women were praying together, which they do not
allow; that the women, like the men, wore skullcaps and prayer
shawls, and that a woman, Anat Hoffman of the Jerusalem City
Council, held the Torah.
</P>
<P>
   Barely audible to one another as they sang and swayed in prayer,
the American rabbis persevered through their entire service.
Restricted by their permit, they were far from the Wall itself,
almost in the parking lot, although not directly in the line of car
exhaust that the last group of Reform rabbis was assigned to, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a group of rabbis can't go to the Wall, then who can go?''
asked Rabbi Ammiel Hirsch, executive director of the Association of
Reform Zionists of America in New York. ``Who does it bother? Who
considers it provocative? It's only provocative if you succumb to
the ultra-Orthodox world view, which sees the Western wall and all
of Israel not as the heritage of the Jewish people, but as a giant
ultra-Orthodox synagogue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Western Wall, the most hallowed Jewish site, has long been a
battleground between traditional and less-traditional Jews. The
prayer area directly in front of the wall is divided into men's and
women's sections, as in Orthodox synagogues, with the men's section
being much larger.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform and Conservative movements have petitioned the Israel
Supreme Court for the right to hold mixed services before the Wall.
A group called Women of the Wall has sought court orders to let
them read from the Torah and wear prayer shawls there.
</P>
<P>
   Strictly Orthodox leaders here and in the United States have
successfully fought all attempts to change the status quo at the
Wall. One Orthodox group, Am Echad, faxed a statement from New York
on Monday to condemn the Reform rabbis' trip as a provocation. The
statement linked the visit to recent Supreme Court orders, growing
out of suits brought by Reform and Conservative Jews, that grant
additional rights to non-Orthodox Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, from Rabbi Avi Shafran, said in part: ``It is
unfortunate and, sadly, all too telling that some members of the
Reform clergy seem determined to create confrontation not only in
the Jewish State's courts and legislature, but at what Jewish
tradition considers the holiest spot in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask this morning's American visitors to turn their energies
to constructive, not destructive, ends, to confront the plagues of
assimilation and intermarriage that are raging in their own
American communities, and allow Israel's Jews to preserve their own
relationship with Jewish religious law and tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation boils down to a showdown between Jews over the
legitimacy of Reform and Conservative Judaism, the dominant
movements in the United States, which are very small here.
</P>
<P>
   Most Israelis are what the society here calls ``secular,''
meaning that they do not belong to a synagogue or obey Jewish law,
although many observe the Sabbath and most celebrate all Jewish
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Sephardic chief rabbi, Eliahu Bakshi-Doron, lashed
out at the Reform movement, saying that by sanctioning assimilation
it had led to the loss of more Jews than the Holocaust. He later
apologized. But is not uncommon to hear such language.
</P>
<P>
   There is even what some would call hypersensitivity to
historical references. When Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
announced a new campaign slogan over the weekend that declared him
``a strong leader for a strong people,'' the opposition Labor Party
was quick to condemn it for summoning memories of Nazi propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   Offended by the back and forth, a group of Holocaust survivors
appealed to all political parties Monday to ``keep the subject of
the Holocaust out of political debate and election campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation at the wall Monday also touched another thorny
issue, what many see as an ownership battle over Israel: To whom
does the Jewish homeland belong?
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis see the Jewish diaspora as vital to their
existence. Others resent what they see as American meddling.
</P>
<P>
   The students Monday repeatedly shouted for the Americans to ``go
back to the United States!''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Stephen Fuchs of Temple Beth Israel in West Hartford,
Conn., did not hesitate to shout back. When Leizerson, the
Parliament member, called the Reform rabbis a disgrace, Fuchs
yelled back that he was a disgrace, too.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Stacy Offner of Minneapolis, however, preferred to
concentrate on prayer. ``It was difficult,'' she said. ``We come
with so much love of Zion. It's very hard to be reminded of how
hateful some people feel toward us.''

 &HT;    Bowles calls affair 'grossly inappropriate,' but says Clinton
should remain in office
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ President Clinton deserves censure, not
removal from office, for trying to hide his ''grossly inappropriate
affair'' with Monica Lewinsky, former White House chief of staff
Erskine Bowles said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a sharply critical appraisal of his former boss and golfing
buddy's conduct involving Lewinsky, Bowles said Clinton's marriage
has been damaged and his presidential accomplishments, from welfare
reform to balancing the federal budget, forever tainted.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has paid an enormous price for this big mistake, and I
think people forget that,'' said Bowles, 53, who has returned to
investment banking in Charlotte after leaving the White House last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in the offices of Carousel Capital, a merchant
bank Bowles rejoined last month, he said he ''never, not once,
publicly or privately, offered the president any leeway on what he
did, nor did he want any....Nobody, including the president,
approved of what he did....It is inexcusable.
</P>
<P>
   ''And then he did every single thing that he could do that was
humanly possible to keep it a secret,'' Bowles said, ''a secret
from me, from the other members of the Cabinet, from the White
House staff, from his wife, from his child and from the American
people.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, two wrongs don't make a right,'' Bowles said. ''But
I don't believe that it rises to the level that the founding
fathers had in mind when they talked about overturning the will of
the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will be remembered as ''someone who accomplished an
extraordinary amount in spite of going through investigation after
investigation after investigation after investigation,'' Bowles
said, referring to a string of federal inquiries culminating with
independent counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation into Clinton's
relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do I think a censure is appropriate?'' Bowles said.
''Absolutely. And I think that is the way it should have gone to
begin with...I assure you that an overwhelming majority of the
Democrats would vote for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowles added that he believes that, once the president leaves
office, ''Ken Starr has the right to prosecute him just like any
other American.''

 &HT;    Falcons leave Miami in post-Super Bowl daze
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ As the Atlanta Falcons milled about the lobby of the
team hotel here Monday morning, rummaging through Super Bowl
souvenirs whose prices had been slashed, they looked out of place.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody was moving slowly, defensive end Lester Archambeau and
fullback Brian Kozlowski each had one leg encased in removable
casts, and center Robbie Tobeck hobbled around, carrying but not
using crutches.
</P>
<P>
   They had been thumped by the Broncos 34-19 the night before in
the first Super Bowl appearance in the franchise's 33 years. It was
impossible to tell, however, if they were reeling more from the
game or the sequence of events leading up to it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some mild protestations to the contrary, the Falcons
were distracted when free safety Eugene Robinson was arrested and
charged at 9 o'clock the night before the game for soliciting oral
sex from a female undercover police officer.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons (16-3) didn't do Sunday as they did in the 11-game
winning streak that preceded the Super Bowl, and it's possible to
speculate that the circus-like atmosphere before the game enveloped
them.
</P>
<P>
   Only four of 53 players had played in Super Bowls. And coach Dan
Reeves' decision to allow families to stay with players in the team
hotel might have been a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Security at the hotel was slack enough that fans constantly came
and went all week. The team did not, as many do, switch to an
undisclosed, more secure hotel the night before the game, even
though the NFL made provisions for the Falcons to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, though, said he thought the week of preparation went
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our organization did a great job. It was
tremendously organized,'' he said. ``Our concentration was good. We
had the approach all year where families were allowed to stay with
the team, and we're not a team that stays in a hotel the night
before (home) games.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Changing hotels) was a possibility. (But) I did that once,
and it was a fiasco. There's all kinds of different ways to do
things. I don't think that affected us at all, staying here,
particularly when you're playing a 6 o'clock game.''
</P>
<P>
   All week, though, in addition to socializing about town,
especially early in the week, and coping with mandatory media
sessions, players signed autographs, posed for pictures, played
mediator in family discussions _ and practiced a few hours each
day.
</P>
<P>
   Things got off to a shaky start the Sunday before, when the team
arrived and wide receiver Terance Mathis complained publicly about
Pro Bowl players and 10-year veterans being allowed to leave the
plane first.
</P>
<P>
   During the week, a few players, especially Pro Bowl cornerback
Ray Buchanan and Pro Bowl left tackle Bob Whitfield, said all kinds
of strange things to the media.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Sunday, a defense that grew more stout through the
season gave up a 457 yards and a season-high 34 points while
mounting a weak pass rush against Denver quarterback John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said all along that we're going to have some guys who get
caught up in the hype. That's the Super Bowl,'' said linebacker
Cornelius Bennett, the first player to play for a losing team in
five Super Bowls, after four with Buffalo. ``Everybody wants to
look good, do good and say good things. Sometimes, it doesn't
always work out right.''
</P>
<P>
   On offense, a unit that during the season scored on 89.1 percent
of its possessions inside its opponents' 20-yard line kept
misfiring down close.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta reached the Denver 8-, 26-, 8-, 11-, 21- and 26-yard
lines during the game and got two field goals, missed one, threw
two interceptions and turned the ball over on downs.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons led the NFL with a plus-14 turnover ratio during the
season, but lost that battle 4-1 to Denver. Chris Chandler threw
interceptions on the first three possessions of the second half,
resulting in 14 Denver points.

   ``As a coach, you wish the guys hadn't said some of the things
they did,'' Reeves said. ``But I never have been one to (muzzle
players). Overall, I'm proud of the way our guys handled this
week.''

 &HT;    IOC holds doping summit
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (i) International and (s) Sports categories.)
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ When the International Olympic Committee
gathers today, the debate will shift from bribery and graft to the
spreading scourge of performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day world summit on doping, a bid to squash yet
another scandal that threatens to turn off corporate sponsors,
follows a string of headlines since the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The most damaging came from the Berlin trials of former East
German doctors and coaches who harrowingly detailed administering
male hormones to young female athletes _ none of whom tested
positive in subsequent Olympic competitions _ and from French
authorities raiding two cycling teams participating in the Tour de
France race last summer and confiscating hundreds of doses of
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC's ethical standards have been questioned because of
mounting evidence that some members might have accepted gifts in
exchange for votes on Olympic bid cities. And there is some doubt
whether the doping conference is a legitimate avenue for reform or
a desperate public relations stunt to cover past failings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would have to be pretty rah-rah about the IOC to believe
drug-testing is working,'' said Charles Yesalis, a Penn State
professor and author of ``Anabolic Steroids in Sport and
Exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this is interwined. The drug scandals are not separate
from the bribes. This is the modus operandi of this organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a business, and drug use is bad for business. So you
cover it up. You put in place a system that would hoodwink the
public, hoodwink the journalists and not really catch anybody, but
you can say you have a system. The problem is, people have become
wise to the PR scam.''
</P>
<P>
   As Yesalis and others see it, the Olympic business is that of
producing heroes and selling dreams, not exposing drug users and
cheats.
</P>
<P>
   Unwittingly, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch hammered home
the point last summer with words to a Spanish newspaper he later
had to retract. Samaranch said he wanted to drop some drugs from
the banned list and punish only those who took substances harmful
to athletes. He had to be reminded by Prince Alexandre de Merode,
head of the IOC Medical Commission, that all of the drugs listed
had harmful side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the 1998 Winter Olympics, Samaranch pledged $50
million for an IOC anti-doping campaign that never got off the
ground. This week, he is expected to produce plans to establish an
international doping agency and to commit $25 million to
anti-doping research, while attempting to bring the various sports
federations together on a uniform penalty system for doping
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Former IOC member Robert Helmick said if Samaranch wanted to get
rid of the drug problem he would commit at least $200 million to
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The conference) is basically to cover up, to divert
attention,'' Helmick said.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch suggested that de Merode, who oversees the IOC's
flawed system, head the new effort, raising doubts about the
independence of the agency.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, such powerful sports federations as soccer (FIFA) and
swimming (FINA) opposed an IOC proposal that athletes face life
bans and fines of as much as up to $1 million in serious cases of
``intentional doping,'' along with selective bans for some
first-time offenders. The suspicion has lingered for years that the
IOC more inclined toward a passive tolerance of doping, with a
scant few athletes testing positive, rather than a drug-free
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Samaranch regime, one-tenth of 1 percent of the
athletes tested positive at an Olympiad.
</P>
<P>
   Only two athletes flunked tests for steroids at the Atlanta
Games, while the IOC ignored five other samples that were detected
by their high-tech equipment and found to contain banned
strength-builders. An arbitration panel threw out the
disqualifications of five other athletes who tested positive for
using a stimulant.
</P>
<P>
   The disputed steroid samples were tested by a device known as a
high-resolution mass spectrometer, which the IOC asked Atlanta
Olympic organizers to purchase just months before the Games, at
$500,000 each. De Merode said the tests were declared invalid
because the newness of the equipment resulted in ``technical
difficulties,'' but the decision still rankles some members of the
IOC medical commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medical commitee never heard any of this,'' Arne
Ljungqvist said. ``Of course, it concerns me.''
</P>
<P>
   Questionable drug-testing dates back to the 1984 Games in Los
Angeles. Don Catlin, who assisted in the Atlanta lab and oversaw
drug testing in LA, said that nine positive tests turned up
``missing'' after the Los Angeles Games. Those athletes' initial
``A'' samples proved positive, but there were no tests performed on
their ``B'' samples as required to ultimately confirm a positive.
</P>
<P>
   The athletes were never identified.
</P>
<P>
   De Merode has acknowledged that paperwork on the ``A'' tests
mysteriously was removed from his room in Los Angeles at the close
of the Games. History reads that the Los Angeles Games produced 10
positive tests, not 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected we would be doing 'B' confirmations in the ensuing
months, which was the way it had been in Montreal (at the 1976
Olympics),'' Catlin said. ``That never came to pass. Then, it came
out that the codes (numbers assigned in order to conceal the
athlete's identity) were somehow shredded or lost. I don't know
where they went. All I know is there were some cases that did not
go to 'B' confirmation.''
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Olympic track coach Pat Connolly has told a Senate
judiciary committee she believes ``at least 40 percent of the
(U.S.) women's team in Seoul had probably used steroids at sometime
in their preparation for the Games.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the Americans tested positive, but the most famous drug
case did break in Seoul in 1988 _ Canadian gold-medal sprinter Ben
Johnson flunking a test for steroids. In retrospect, he often is
cast not just as a cheater but someone careless enough in his drug
use to get caught.
</P>
<P>
   In Seoul, IOC drug testers were aware of Russian sports
officials operating a drug lab in a docked ship to monitor their
athletes and make sure they would not be shamed by a positive test.
</P>
<P>
   Catlin, who worked in the Seoul lab, said he heard about the
Russian ship near the close of the Games. He later confirmed the
story in speaking with two Russian scientists who operated the lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is shame in it, it's why the Soviets found it
necessary to have a boat to check their athletes at the last
minute,'' Catlin said. ``But that is not unlike the situation being
revealed during the East German trials. They did the exact same
thing, and the Soviet bloc was very sensitive to these things. . .
.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every country, including our own, tests athletes before
leaving for the Games. But there is a difference between the
practice and what is done with the results. If you don't do
anything with the positives, and the athletes go to the Games, that
is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the U.S., testing is embroiled in controversy. The U.S.
Olympic Commitee administers its own drug-testing program rather
than contracting with an independent agency. Its own advisory panel
concluded that the current arrangement is a conflict because the
USOC supports the same athletes financially.
</P>
<P>
   Only about half of the 150-200 athletes targeted each month for
random tests wind up being checked, a USOC drug-testing official
acknowledged.

 &HT;    Atlanta organizers spent nearly $8 million to win games

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta's Olympic bid team spent $7.8 million lobbying
the International Olympic Committee in the final two years of a
whirlwind campaign to win the 1996 Centennial Olympic Games,
financial records reveal.
</P>
<P>
   Half of that amount was spent directly on travel for the Atlanta
team and the IOC, plus entertainment and gifts for IOC members and
their families.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the widening vote-buying scandal in Salt Lake and other
Olympic cities, no one has suggested the millions spent by the
Atlanta bid team circling the globe to secure votes and hosting IOC
members in high style was excessive or improper. And the amount
pales in comparison to the total spent by some of Atlanta's
competitors for the 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
   But the bid committee's tax returns clearly illustrate the high
price to engage in bidding wars between cities seeking to land the
Olympics and reap billions in economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
   It's a seven-days-a-week world of first-class travel, four-star
accommodations, lavish entertainment and suitcases loaded with
personal gifts that easily overwhelms any city effort to woo
national sporting events or political conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's bid campaign was run almost entirely on private
donations from philanthropies and corporations, and on
merchandising. More than $12 million was taken in during the
four-year fund-raising campaign, according to tax returns released
to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution by the nonprofit Georgia
Amateur Athletics Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The GAAF was created in 1987 to manage the bid effort. Billy
Payne, who headed the bid, was its president; then-Mayor Andrew
Young was chairman. The GAAF was the predecessor to the Atlanta
Committee for the Olympic Games, which was incorporated in 1991
after Atlanta won the Games.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the funds was spent in the final two years
leading up to the successful September 1990 vote in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The bid group, known as the Atlanta Organizing Committee, spent
$376,545 on the four-day trip to Tokyo. It was a heady time and
there were many checks to write: Dozens of Atlanta bid volunteers
and staffers required air fare, hotel rooms and charter buses. More
than 300 Georgians accompanied the bid team to Tokyo for the IOC
session _ from most of the Atlanta City Council and then-Mayor
Maynard Jackson to the 60-member ``Dream Team'' youth group. The
AOC picked up part of their tab.
</P>
<P>
   A high-tech interactive display was in an exhibition hall, a
hospitality suite stocked with food and drink and a requisite huge
celebration party after the win. All IOC members found bedroom
slippers and embroidered pillowcases, courtesy of Atlanta, in their
hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Ginger Watkins, a key AOC member who organized these events,
remembers leasing an ``Atlanta House'' near the hotel for added
hospitality and throwing a party at a banquet hall for the several
hundred visitors from Atlanta two days before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In the final nine months of the campaign, the AOC spent $3.1
million on everything from IOC member visits to Atlanta and bid
team travels around the globe to public relations and a handsome
five-volume bid book for each IOC member.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta bid team _ led by attorneys Payne, Charlie Battle
and Horace Sibley along with Young and volunteers Watkins and Linda
Stephenson _ traveled to IOC members' homelands and hosted them and
their families in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Battle, the AOC's primary international emissary, said a bid
team member visited the homes of 85 of the 87 voting members on the
IOC. In the last nine months before the vote, those visits cost
$401,694.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-eight IOC members came to Atlanta, with the bid team
typically putting them up at the Marriott Marquis, feting them in
private suburban Atlanta homes and providing a car and driver for a
tour of the venues under construction.
</P>
<P>
   The bid team spent $646,879 on these visits _ an average of
$9,513 per visitor _ during the nine-month period.
</P>
<P>
   Details of how the money was spent are not known. All documents
related to the bid _ other than the public tax returns _ are packed
in boxes at the Atlanta History Center. The GAAF refused to make
them available to the public at this time.
</P>
<P>
   Scrutiny of Salt Lake City Olympic bid documents by special
investigatory bodies has revealed as much as $1 million in cash,
medical and travel expenses and lavish gifts going to IOC members
in that city's successful campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has moved to expel six members for taking improper gifts
and payments from Salt Lake bidders, and four others have resigned.
The IOC says it is expanding an internal investigation to include
candidate cities from 1996 through 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Pound, chairman of the IOC's investigation, said he sent
letters to two dozen bid committees of Winter and Summer Games
requesting details of any suspected misconduct by IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Yarbrough, spokesman for the Atlanta bidders, said Monday
they had not received the letter, but he was preparing a response
anyway. ``We hope to have it finished as quickly as possible very
early in the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta bid officials have steadfastly maintained they conducted
their campaign within the rules and that no IOC members abused
their position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about my part in it, what I know about it, what we
did and how we did it,'' said Battle, who is now president of
Central Atlanta Progress.
</P>
<P>
   But Atlanta's competitors are speaking out about excesses.
Manchester officials complained about visiting IOC members trying
to collect twice or three times for expenses for a single visit to
the candidate city in England.
</P>
<P>
   And Toronto officials said 26 of 69 IOC members who visited the
city broke IOC rules either by bringing more than one guest, coming
more than once or staying longer than allowed.
</P>
<P>
   They said the most blatant abuse by IOC members was the
misappropriation of travel expenses and airline tickets or passes
provided by Toronto officials.
</P>
<P>
   Battle said the Atlanta team will tell the IOC they did not
experience the problems of other cities. ``We have always been
interested in convincing people we did this in a very honorable
way,'' he said.

 &HT;    Committee sets out to clear up misunderstandings surrounding
Samaranch
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (i) International and (s) Sports categories.)
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ Amid increasing calls for the
resignation of Juan Antonio Samaranch, the International Olympic
Committee on Monday sought to clarify the record on what it called
``inaccuracies and misrepresentations'' circulating worldwide about
its embattled president.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic scandal broke with allegations that IOC members
accepted nearly $800,000 worth of goods and services from Salt Lake
before the city was awarded the 2002 Winter Games. Details continue
to surface about improper payments made to members from other
cities bidding to host the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC, seeking to play down the notion that Samaranch, 78,
thirsts for an imperial lifestyle, said in a two-page release that
he serves as a volunteer and denied that he resides in a posh suite
at the five-star Palace Hotel. Instead, Samaranch is said to reside
in a ``small suite'' at a cost of about $211 a night, which the
hotel discounts to $70 when he travels out of town. Suites at the
Palace start at $433 a night for those walking in off the street.
</P>
<P>
   If suitors to host the Olympic Games opt to treat him like
royalty and address him as ``excellency,'' it is their doing, the
IOC said. The committee's statement said Samaranch imposes no such
demands and would prefer a more humble treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The statement makes no reference to Samaranch once having
commissioned an unsuccessful publicity campaign to win himself the
Nobel Peace Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Highlights of the IOC spin effort are that:
</P>
<P>
   _ Samaranch requested several years ago that people stop
referring to him with the diplomatic courtesy title of
``excellency,'' which dates to his service as Spain's ambassador to
the former Soviet Union and to the People's Republic of Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
   _ He served only as undersecretary of sports to Spain's former
fascist dictator Franco, not in a cabinet-level minister's
position.
</P>
<P>
   _ He does not request luxury cars, such as stretch limousines;
bid or host cities select his means of transportation. Nor does he
ask for luxury accommodations when he visits cities.
</P>
<P>
   _ While acknowledging that he accepts gifts from cities and
various officials, Samaranch said he does so on behalf of the IOC
and the gifts are either displayed in the Olympic Museum or kept in
storage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all these stories, but if someone will check they
will find 90 percent of the rumors are untrue, especially the way
they handle our president'' said IOC member Alex Gilady, a longtime
Samaranch friend and an NBC vice president. ``Really, this is a
modest man who lives in a bedroom and a half-room in the Lausanne
Palace, and people put it like it's a full-floor suite and that he
demands the presidential suite when he travels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Check in Salt Lake or Atlanta, check in the files if his
office ever requested anything,'' Gilady said. ``This is for
(cities) to do what they think is right. Did you see him ride in a
limousine in Atlanta (during the Games)? No, he was traveling
around in a van, not even a sedan.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is whether Samaranch, IOC president since 1980, can
survive the widening scandal. The criticism has not subsided, even
after four members resigned and another six were targeted for
expulsion. Samaranch is not likely to be voted out, because most
IOC members were his appointees. But one of the main offenders
identified in the scandal, Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of
Congo, has said he plans to fight expulsion and attempt to take
Samaranch down with him.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the IOC's executive board agreed Monday to set up an
ethics commission to delve into the allegations involving Salt Lake
City and most likely Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The five-person commission is expected to be in place before the
IOC's general meeting next month. The commission will include three
outsiders, described by IOC director general Francois Carrard as
''very senior, independent personalities.'' He declined to say who
is under consideration.

<P>
   ABOARD U.S.S. HARRY S. TRUMAN, off Florida _ The Navy spent $4.5
billion to build this, the nation's newest aircraft carrier. It has
two nuclear reactors, the latest electronic, computer and
navigational equipment, and, for the long ``cruises'' to come,
amenities for the crew, like televisions in almost every berth.
</P>
<P>
   What the Navy cannot put aboard the Truman is a full crew.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every department on the carrier faces a shortage of
sailors, from the engine room to the intelligence division to the
mess. The air department should have more than 600 sailors to carry
out the choreographic feat of launching and landing warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Last week it mustered 448.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people aren't there,'' Capt. Thomas G. Otterbein said,
sitting on the Truman's bridge as aircraft practiced takeoffs and
landings in rolling seas 100 miles out in the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The Truman, commissioned by President Clinton last July to join
the nation's 11 other aircraft carriers, is not alone. Two weeks
ago, the Navy disclosed that it has had as many as 22,000 empty
positions, or billets, in a force of 372,000. The vast majority of
those were aboard the Navy's 327 ships, rather than on shore.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy's shortages have a variety of causes, not the least of
which is a thriving economy that creates more enticing
opportunities for young people than the prospect long voyages at
sea. And the Navy has responded with a variety of programs to
counter that hard reality, offering bonuses and championing
proposals now before Congress to increase pay and retirement
benefits for all military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy's commanders insist that, for now at least, the
shortages have not hurt their primary mission, which is defending
the United States. But they concede that the problem is taking a
toll on ships like the Truman, where sailors and officers work
longer hours to pick up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   And that, in turn, is worsening the problems at the root of the
shortages: recruiting new sailors and keeping those who have
already joined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sort of feeds on itself,'' Otterbein said. ``The workload
still remains pretty high. Now you're laying it on the backs of
fewer people.''
</P>
<P>
   In Norfolk, Va., home port of the Truman and fulcrum of the
Atlantic Fleet, there are shortages on almost every warship, from
the frigates to the attack submarines. The aircraft carrier
Enterprise, whose warplanes provided much of the punch for the air
raids against Iraq in December, left port last fall nearly 400
short of a full crew of more than 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any command out there that isn't saying we're
short in one way or another,'' said Master Chief Jesse J. Elliott,
the senior noncommissioned officer for the Atlantic Fleet's
carriers and air squadrons.
</P>
<P>
   The Leyte Gulf, a guided-missile cruiser, is scheduled to deploy
to the Mediterranean Sea in March but so far has a crew of only
338. It should have 410. Its commander, Capt. Raymond P. Donahue
Jr., said he expected to fill at least some of the most important
slots before the ship steamed for six months at sea, but only at
the last minute and with junior sailors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of their replacements will walk up the brow a week before
they deploy,'' Donahue said, referring to the ship's gangway.
``They haven't trained with us. The continuity isn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenges with recruiting and retention have affected the
entire military, but the Navy's difficulties have become
particularly acute. The Pentagon's most recent survey on attitudes
about the military found that only 9 percent of young men between
16 and 21 were likely to consider joining the Navy, the lowest
percentage for any of the four services.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for the first time since the draft ended in 1973, the
Navy fell short of its annual recruiting goal, missing by 7,000.
Since new recruits almost always go straight to sea after boot
camp, that shortfall is now rippling through the fleet.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Navy is not retaining nearly enough
enlisted personnel, particularly those with highly technical kills.
</P>
<P>
   The chief of naval operations, Adm. Jay L. Johnson, said in an
interview that the shortage was only partly a problem of recruiting
and retention. The Navy has thousands of unassigned sailors who
could, with better management, be reassigned to fill the empty
billets, Johnson said. The answer, he said, is ``to put the right
people in the right billets at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even he conceded, however, that the Navy faces challenges far
beyond the ability of better management: a declining willingness of
young people to serve in the military and a thriving economy that
entices those who would or do serve.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Petty Officer Second Class Melissa Teames, an air traffic
controller aboard the Truman, plans to leave the Navy on April 7
after five years. Only 24, she is highly trained and disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   But the Federal Aviation Administration is hiring again in the
midst of a boom in commercial travel. And, as she explained, the
FAA does not send you to sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing the same job here,'' Ms. Teames said, standing
inside the darkened control center beneath the Truman's flight
deck, ``but under more difficult conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy admits that life at sea is not for everybody _ even
aboard the big carriers. The Truman has a daily newspaper, a post
office, a barber shop, a store and even automatic teller machines.
</P>
<P>
   But as big as it is _ longer than five blocks of Manhattan and,
from the waterline to its highest point, 20 stories tall _ the
Truman is cramped and crowded. Except for the cavernous hangar bay,
its passageways are narrow.
</P>
<P>
   There is very little common space, and even less privacy.
Enlisted sailors sleep in bunks, stacked three deep, a step away
from three more. They call them ``coffin racks.'' For those who
work deep in the ship's hull, it is possible to pass days at a time
without seeing daylight.
</P>
<P>
   At a muster last week, the Truman's ``ship's crew'' totaled
2,543, more than 13 percent below a full contingent of 2,933. The
Truman does not yet have aircraft squadrons on board. Once it does,
the total crew will grow by 2,300 to 2,400.
</P>
<P>
   The Truman will not deploy overseas until next year. The ship
spent six weeks at sea late last year and has another ``cruise''
planned in March. It steamed into the Atlantic this week to allow
pilots to perform the takeoffs and landings they need to stay
proficient.
</P>
<P>
   While at sea, the shortages are felt in ways large and small.
Sailors have to work longer, usually 12-hour shifts, and spend more
days in ``duty stations,'' handling watch or otherwise being on
call. The ship's mess has half the cooks it needs, and so sailors
from other departments have to fill in.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy is scrambling, on shore and at sea, to address the
causes and effects of the personnel shortages.
</P>
<P>
   On the Truman, Otterbein has made an effort to improve the
quality of life. While the ship was under construction, he ordered
the shipbuilders to install an extra weight room to give sailors a
diversion. The ship also has more televisions than the older
carriers, showing 15 channels beamed in by satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, one movie appeared especially popular: ``McHale's
Navy.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Warrant Officer Leon A. Coles, who runs the mess, said he
held the key to keeping sailors in the Navy: better chow. The
Truman just won the Navy's award for food service, and anecdotally
at least, the sailors seconded it. ``It's going to have an impact
on whether they stay in the Navy,'' Coles said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On shore, the Navy has taken other more drastic, and
controversial, steps. It is adding 700 new recruiters to the 3,800
it had last year and sharply increased the advertising budget, to
$70 million from $45 million. But it is also going to allow in more
recruits who have failed to receive a high school diploma, despite
experience that has shown they tend to drop out of boot camp more
than high school graduates.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy's commanders also hope that Clinton's proposal to raise
military salaries by as much as 9.9 percent and to improve
retirement benefits will help. Republicans in Congress have
responded by proposing even more, including raises of 10.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There are also new bonuses for enlisting and bonuses for
re-enlisting. In some specialized fields, sailors can receive as
much as $30,000 to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the efforts initiated by Johnson, the chief of naval
operations, has been to cut by a quarter the number of inspections
and administrative tasks that ships face while in port, burdening
sailors with extra work during the time they should be enjoying
time off.
</P>
<P>
   A reduction in administrative work appeals to Daniel C. Appold,
a machinist mate second class on the Truman. ``You put a wrench in
my hand, and I'm happy,'' Appold said as he worked on one of the
ship's two backup diesel engines. ``Put all that paperwork in front
of me ... ,'' he started to say, then shrugged. ``I'd rather have a
wrench.''
</P>
<P>
   An 11-year veteran, he is not sure whether to stay when his
enlistment comes up next summer, though he heartily welcomed the
idea of a raise. He expressed frustration with the crew shortages,
but also seemed pleased with the Truman's efforts to improve the
amenities, especially the food, which he said far surpassed that
aboard his last ship, the carrier Abraham Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to the Lincoln,'' he said, sweat on his brow, deep
inside the Truman's hull, ``this is a little slice of paradise.''

 &HT;    Committee sets out to clear up misunderstandings surrounding
Samaranch
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (i) International and (s) Sports categories.)
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ Amid increasing calls for the
resignation of Juan Antonio Samaranch, the International Olympic
Committee on Monday sought to clarify the record on what it called
``inaccuracies and misrepresentations'' circulating worldwide about
its embattled president.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic scandal broke with allegations that IOC members
accepted nearly $800,000 worth of goods and services from Salt Lake
before the city was awarded the 2002 Winter Games. Details continue
to surface about improper payments made to members from other
cities bidding to host the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC, seeking to play down the notion that Samaranch, 78,
thirsts for an imperial lifestyle, said in a two-page release that
he serves as a volunteer and denied that he resides in a posh suite
at the five-star Palace Hotel. Instead, Samaranch is said to reside
in a ``small suite'' at a cost of about $211 a night, which the
hotel discounts to $70 when he travels out of town. Suites at the
Palace start at $433 a night for those walking in off the street.
</P>
<P>
   If suitors to host the Olympic Games opt to treat him like
royalty and address him as ``excellency,'' it is their doing, the
IOC said. The committee's statement said Samaranch imposes no such
demands and would prefer a more humble treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The statement makes no reference to Samaranch once having
commissioned an unsuccessful publicity campaign to win himself the
Nobel Peace Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Highlights of the IOC spin effort are that:
</P>
<P>
   _ Samaranch requested several years ago that people stop
referring to him with the diplomatic courtesy title of
``excellency,'' which dates to his service as Spain's ambassador to
the former Soviet Union and to the People's Republic of Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
   _ He served only as undersecretary of sports to Spain's former
fascist dictator Franco, not in a cabinet-level minister's
position.
</P>
<P>
   _ He does not request luxury cars, such as stretch limousines;
bid or host cities select his means of transportation. Nor does he
ask for luxury accommodations when he visits cities.
</P>
<P>
   _ While acknowledging that he accepts gifts from cities and
various officials, Samaranch said he does so on behalf of the IOC
and the gifts are either displayed in the Olympic Museum or kept in
storage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all these stories, but if someone will check they
will find 90 percent of the rumors are untrue, especially the way
they handle our president'' said IOC member Alex Gilady, a longtime
Samaranch friend and an NBC vice president. ``Really, this is a
modest man who lives in a bedroom and a half-room in the Lausanne
Palace, and people put it like it's a full-floor suite and that he
demands the presidential suite when he travels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Check in Salt Lake or Atlanta, check in the files if his
office ever requested anything,'' Gilady said. ``This is for
(cities) to do what they think is right. Did you see him ride in a
limousine in Atlanta (during the Games)? No, he was traveling
around in a van, not even a sedan.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is whether Samaranch, IOC president since 1980, can
survive the widening scandal. The criticism has not subsided, even
after four members resigned and another six were targeted for
expulsion. Samaranch is not likely to be voted out, because most
IOC members were his appointees. But one of the main offenders
identified in the scandal, Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of
Congo, has said he plans to fight expulsion and attempt to take
Samaranch down with him.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the IOC's executive board agreed Monday to set up an
ethics commission to delve into the allegations involving Salt Lake
City and most likely Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The five-person commission is expected to be in place before the
IOC's general meeting next month. The commission will include three
outsiders, described by IOC director general Francois Carrard as
''very senior, independent personalities.'' He declined to say who
is under consideration.

 &HT;    IOC holds doping summit
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (i) International and (s) Sports categories.)
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ When the International Olympic Committee
gathers today, the debate will shift from bribery and graft to the
spreading scourge of performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day world summit on doping, a bid to squash yet
another scandal that threatens to turn off corporate sponsors,
follows a string of headlines since the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The most damaging came from the Berlin trials of former East
German doctors and coaches who harrowingly detailed administering
male hormones to young female athletes _ none of whom tested
positive in subsequent Olympic competitions _ and from French
authorities raiding two cycling teams participating in the Tour de
France race last summer and confiscating hundreds of doses of
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC's ethical standards have been questioned because of
mounting evidence that some members might have accepted gifts in
exchange for votes on Olympic bid cities. And there is some doubt
whether the doping conference is a legitimate avenue for reform or
a desperate public relations stunt to cover past failings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would have to be pretty rah-rah about the IOC to believe
drug-testing is working,'' said Charles Yesalis, a Penn State
professor and author of ``Anabolic Steroids in Sport and
Exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this is interwined. The drug scandals are not separate
from the bribes. This is the modus operandi of this organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a business, and drug use is bad for business. So you
cover it up. You put in place a system that would hoodwink the
public, hoodwink the journalists and not really catch anybody, but
you can say you have a system. The problem is, people have become
wise to the PR scam.''
</P>
<P>
   As Yesalis and others see it, the Olympic business is that of
producing heroes and selling dreams, not exposing drug users and
cheats.
</P>
<P>
   Unwittingly, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch hammered home
the point last summer with words to a Spanish newspaper he later
had to retract. Samaranch said he wanted to drop some drugs from
the banned list and punish only those who took substances harmful
to athletes. He had to be reminded by Prince Alexandre de Merode,
head of the IOC Medical Commission, that all of the drugs listed
had harmful side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the 1998 Winter Olympics, Samaranch pledged $50
million for an IOC anti-doping campaign that never got off the
ground. This week, he is expected to produce plans to establish an
international doping agency and to commit $25 million to
anti-doping research, while attempting to bring the various sports
federations together on a uniform penalty system for doping
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Former IOC member Robert Helmick said if Samaranch wanted to get
rid of the drug problem he would commit at least $200 million to
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The conference) is basically to cover up, to divert
attention,'' Helmick said.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch suggested that de Merode, who oversees the IOC's
flawed system, head the new effort, raising doubts about the
independence of the agency.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, such powerful sports federations as soccer (FIFA) and
swimming (FINA) opposed an IOC proposal that athletes face life
bans and fines of as much as up to $1 million in serious cases of
``intentional doping,'' along with selective bans for some
first-time offenders. The suspicion has lingered for years that the
IOC more inclined toward a passive tolerance of doping, with a
scant few athletes testing positive, rather than a drug-free
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Samaranch regime, one-tenth of 1 percent of the
athletes tested positive at an Olympiad.
</P>
<P>
   Only two athletes flunked tests for steroids at the Atlanta
Games, while the IOC ignored five other samples that were detected
by their high-tech equipment and found to contain banned
strength-builders. An arbitration panel threw out the
disqualifications of five other athletes who tested positive for
using a stimulant.
</P>
<P>
   The disputed steroid samples were tested by a device known as a
high-resolution mass spectrometer, which the IOC asked Atlanta
Olympic organizers to purchase just months before the Games, at
$500,000 each. De Merode said the tests were declared invalid
because the newness of the equipment resulted in ``technical
difficulties,'' but the decision still rankles some members of the
IOC medical commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medical commitee never heard any of this,'' Arne
Ljungqvist said. ``Of course, it concerns me.''
</P>
<P>
   Questionable drug-testing dates back to the 1984 Games in Los
Angeles. Don Catlin, who assisted in the Atlanta lab and oversaw
drug testing in LA, said that nine positive tests turned up
``missing'' after the Los Angeles Games. Those athletes' initial
``A'' samples proved positive, but there were no tests performed on
their ``B'' samples as required to ultimately confirm a positive.
</P>
<P>
   The athletes were never identified.
</P>
<P>
   De Merode has acknowledged that paperwork on the ``A'' tests
mysteriously was removed from his room in Los Angeles at the close
of the Games. History reads that the Los Angeles Games produced 10
positive tests, not 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected we would be doing 'B' confirmations in the ensuing
months, which was the way it had been in Montreal (at the 1976
Olympics),'' Catlin said. ``That never came to pass. Then, it came
out that the codes (numbers assigned in order to conceal the
athlete's identity) were somehow shredded or lost. I don't know
where they went. All I know is there were some cases that did not
go to 'B' confirmation.''
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Olympic track coach Pat Connolly has told a Senate
judiciary committee she believes ``at least 40 percent of the
(U.S.) women's team in Seoul had probably used steroids at sometime
in their preparation for the Games.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the Americans tested positive, but the most famous drug
case did break in Seoul in 1988 _ Canadian gold-medal sprinter Ben
Johnson flunking a test for steroids. In retrospect, he often is
cast not just as a cheater but someone careless enough in his drug
use to get caught.
</P>
<P>
   In Seoul, IOC drug testers were aware of Russian sports
officials operating a drug lab in a docked ship to monitor their
athletes and make sure they would not be shamed by a positive test.
</P>
<P>
   Catlin, who worked in the Seoul lab, said he heard about the
Russian ship near the close of the Games. He later confirmed the
story in speaking with two Russian scientists who operated the lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is shame in it, it's why the Soviets found it
necessary to have a boat to check their athletes at the last
minute,'' Catlin said. ``But that is not unlike the situation being
revealed during the East German trials. They did the exact same
thing, and the Soviet bloc was very sensitive to these things. . .
.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every country, including our own, tests athletes before
leaving for the Games. But there is a difference between the
practice and what is done with the results. If you don't do
anything with the positives, and the athletes go to the Games, that
is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the U.S., testing is embroiled in controversy. The U.S.
Olympic Commitee administers its own drug-testing program rather
than contracting with an independent agency. Its own advisory panel
concluded that the current arrangement is a conflict because the
USOC supports the same athletes financially.
</P>
<P>
   Only about half of the 150-200 athletes targeted each month for
random tests wind up being checked, a USOC drug-testing official
acknowledged.

 &HT;    Atlanta organizers spent nearly $8 million to win games
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (i) International and (s) Sports categories.)By

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta's Olympic bid team spent $7.8 million lobbying
the International Olympic Committee in the final two years of a
whirlwind campaign to win the 1996 Centennial Olympic Games,
financial records reveal.
</P>
<P>
   Half of that amount was spent directly on travel for the Atlanta
team and the IOC, plus entertainment and gifts for IOC members and
their families.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the widening vote-buying scandal in Salt Lake and other
Olympic cities, no one has suggested the millions spent by the
Atlanta bid team circling the globe to secure votes and hosting IOC
members in high style was excessive or improper. And the amount
pales in comparison to the total spent by some of Atlanta's
competitors for the 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
   But the bid committee's tax returns clearly illustrate the high
price to engage in bidding wars between cities seeking to land the
Olympics and reap billions in economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
   It's a seven-days-a-week world of first-class travel, four-star
accommodations, lavish entertainment and suitcases loaded with
personal gifts that easily overwhelms any city effort to woo
national sporting events or political conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's bid campaign was run almost entirely on private
donations from philanthropies and corporations, and on
merchandising. More than $12 million was taken in during the
four-year fund-raising campaign, according to tax returns released
to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution by the nonprofit Georgia
Amateur Athletics Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The GAAF was created in 1987 to manage the bid effort. Billy
Payne, who headed the bid, was its president; then-Mayor Andrew
Young was chairman. The GAAF was the predecessor to the Atlanta
Committee for the Olympic Games, which was incorporated in 1991
after Atlanta won the Games.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the funds was spent in the final two years
leading up to the successful September 1990 vote in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The bid group, known as the Atlanta Organizing Committee, spent
$376,545 on the four-day trip to Tokyo. It was a heady time and
there were many checks to write: Dozens of Atlanta bid volunteers
and staffers required air fare, hotel rooms and charter buses. More
than 300 Georgians accompanied the bid team to Tokyo for the IOC
session _ from most of the Atlanta City Council and then-Mayor
Maynard Jackson to the 60-member ``Dream Team'' youth group. The
AOC picked up part of their tab.
</P>
<P>
   A high-tech interactive display was in an exhibition hall, a
hospitality suite stocked with food and drink and a requisite huge
celebration party after the win. All IOC members found bedroom
slippers and embroidered pillowcases, courtesy of Atlanta, in their
hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Ginger Watkins, a key AOC member who organized these events,
remembers leasing an ``Atlanta House'' near the hotel for added
hospitality and throwing a party at a banquet hall for the several
hundred visitors from Atlanta two days before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In the final nine months of the campaign, the AOC spent $3.1
million on everything from IOC member visits to Atlanta and bid
team travels around the globe to public relations and a handsome
five-volume bid book for each IOC member.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta bid team _ led by attorneys Payne, Charlie Battle
and Horace Sibley along with Young and volunteers Watkins and Linda
Stephenson _ traveled to IOC members' homelands and hosted them and
their families in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Battle, the AOC's primary international emissary, said a bid
team member visited the homes of 85 of the 87 voting members on the
IOC. In the last nine months before the vote, those visits cost
$401,694.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-eight IOC members came to Atlanta, with the bid team
typically putting them up at the Marriott Marquis, feting them in
private suburban Atlanta homes and providing a car and driver for a
tour of the venues under construction.
</P>
<P>
   The bid team spent $646,879 on these visits _ an average of
$9,513 per visitor _ during the nine-month period.
</P>
<P>
   Details of how the money was spent are not known. All documents
related to the bid _ other than the public tax returns _ are packed
in boxes at the Atlanta History Center. The GAAF refused to make
them available to the public at this time.
</P>
<P>
   Scrutiny of Salt Lake City Olympic bid documents by special
investigatory bodies has revealed as much as $1 million in cash,
medical and travel expenses and lavish gifts going to IOC members
in that city's successful campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has moved to expel six members for taking improper gifts
and payments from Salt Lake bidders, and four others have resigned.
The IOC says it is expanding an internal investigation to include
candidate cities from 1996 through 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Pound, chairman of the IOC's investigation, said he sent
letters to two dozen bid committees of Winter and Summer Games
requesting details of any suspected misconduct by IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Yarbrough, spokesman for the Atlanta bidders, said Monday
they had not received the letter, but he was preparing a response
anyway. ``We hope to have it finished as quickly as possible very
early in the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta bid officials have steadfastly maintained they conducted
their campaign within the rules and that no IOC members abused
their position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about my part in it, what I know about it, what we
did and how we did it,'' said Battle, who is now president of
Central Atlanta Progress.
</P>
<P>
   But Atlanta's competitors are speaking out about excesses.
Manchester officials complained about visiting IOC members trying
to collect twice or three times for expenses for a single visit to
the candidate city in England.
</P>
<P>
   And Toronto officials said 26 of 69 IOC members who visited the
city broke IOC rules either by bringing more than one guest, coming
more than once or staying longer than allowed.
</P>
<P>
   They said the most blatant abuse by IOC members was the
misappropriation of travel expenses and airline tickets or passes
provided by Toronto officials.
</P>
<P>
   Battle said the Atlanta team will tell the IOC they did not
experience the problems of other cities. ``We have always been
interested in convincing people we did this in a very honorable
way,'' he said.

<P>
   A century from now, after the Coors Broncos have thrashed the
Coca-Cola Falcons in Super Bowl CXXXIII, anthropologists at Boeing
University will return to their study of newspaper clippings from
1999. And they will chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' they'll say. ``Look at how much was made of the
commercials during Super Bowl telecasts in those days! It seems
nobody paid attention to the game.''
</P>

   Of course, the game in 2099 will command so much more attention
simply because it will be played over four days in mid-February,
kind of like a bloated Stephen King miniseries, only scarier. (A
cryogenically preserved John Madden will be defrosted once a year
to do color commentary.)
</P>
<P>
   Until then, it is right and good to celebrate the creative urge.
Especially when one of the Super Bowl teams has worse aim than the
baddies in a James Bond movie.
</P>
<P>
   Creative scorekeeping was taking place in ad agencies around the
country Sunday. It has been a popular pastime since 1984, when
Apple's classic introduction of the Macintosh computer made
marketers realize the Super Bowl can be a great launch pad.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, for example, the local office of Bozell Worldwide
was abuzz during the Super Bowl. ``We couldn't stop laughing at the
Cracker Jack ad,'' said Mary Knight, partner and creative director.
``The room was laughing so hard we couldn't hear the last half of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The spot called attention to Cracker Jack's new snack-size bags,
but also mentioned that it was testing a ``really, really big
bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the prize you might find inside a really, really big bag
of Cracker Jack. In the Super Bowl spot, a little girl finds a
pony.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to falcons, broncos and a prize pony, the Super Bowl
featured a menagerie from Anheuser-Busch, including Louie the
Lizard, who gets a tongue-lashing from the Budweiser frogs; a pair
of cute Dalmatians involved in a little one-upmanship, a mouse who
helps his owner get the girl; and a desperate lobster who escapes a
restaurant by holding a bottle of Bud hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Knight thinks this was a good year, but not a great one, for
Super Bowl ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had several favorites,'' she said, ``but nothing jumped out
on top.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the faves, besides the one for Cracker Jack, were the
Budweiser lobster (``great use of the product as hero''),
Monster.com (``excellent job of driving me to their Web site'') and
Apple's use of a classic computer _ HAL 9000 from ``2001: A Space
Odyssey'' _ to point out that Apple's Macs don't have a Y2K
problem. Knight said its simple execution was ``refreshing,'' and
entirely different from the big production number that made Apple
famous 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, whose agency had no clients advertising on the Super
Bowl this year, wasn't as fond of the spots for new Crispy M&AMP;M's.
(I must say I was charmed by a big orange M&AMP;M floating in a
swimming pool with Halle Berry.)
</P>
<P>
   Like Knight, I liked the ad for Monster.com, an Internet job
database. It featured stark, black-and-white images of children
saying things like, ``When I grow up, I want to be replaced on a
whim,'' `` ... claw my way up to middle management,'' ``... be paid
less for doing the same job.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's tagline: ``There's a better job out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Such as floating in a swimming pool with Halle Berry.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: I get this bad feeling in the pit of my
stomach every day before I go to work. At first I thought it was
because I was in a new job, but it's been almost a year, and I just
don't feel right. I don't mind the job, and the people are nice,
but I have this feeling. Can you help me? M.B.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Your ``gut feel'' is telling you that there is something
about this job that you cannot stomach. In fact, the way you
describe your work is rather revealing. As opposed to saying that
you enjoy the job, you state that you ``don't mind the job.''
</P>
<P>
   You should make a list for yourself of everything that you truly
want in a job, from the most important factor to the least
important, and then place a check mark by each of those factors
covered in your present job. You are going to find some items that
are not checked, and they are the most likely sources of your ``gut
feel.''
</P>
<P>
   With this list in hand, you should put together a plan.
Depending upon the content of your list, you may need to consider a
job change or a move, but the list could just as easily be telling
you to continue your education, seek a transfer, clear the air,
push for a promotion. There is something deep inside of you telling
you to make some changes. If you don't listen to yourself, who
will?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our committee meets regularly to evaluate project proposals,
but one member always comes unprepared and spends his presentation
time reading through his proposals that he is obviously looking at
for the first time. The result is we waste time and have to put his
proposals back in the agenda for the next meeting. What is the best
way to deal with this? E.C.
</P>
<P>
   A: When one person regularly comes to a meeting unprepared, it
actually means that there are two people whose preparation skills
are rather thin. The first is your associate who prefers to prepare
for the meeting on your time rather than on his, and the second is
whoever is leading these meetings.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like your associate goes through this same routine at
every meeting, and although the leader must be aware of the
problem, the only action he or she takes is to table your
unprepared associate's proposals to the next meeting, and this
obviously does not induce him to change.
</P>
<P>
   If you and some of your colleagues have a decent working
relationship with this individual, you can tell him that his
actions are wasting everybody's time, and all of you would be most
appreciative if he would prepare for these meetings, adding that
you are willing to help if he would like.
</P>
<P>
   If you do not have this kind of relationship with him, or if you
get nowhere in your discussion with him, you should review the
situation with whoever is running the meetings. And, if this person
is not prepared to act like a leader, then you should prepare
yourselves to discuss the matter at a higher level.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Six employees report to me, and one works far too slowly. The
quality of his work is always very good, but he causes delays for
the rest of the department, all of whom produce high-quality work.
I have strongly advised him to step up the pace, but he still
creeps along. What can you suggest? I.M.
</P>
<P>
   A: Rather than advising a slow-moving employee to step on the
gas, you should slow down and try to find out what may be causing
the delay.
</P>
<P>
   People work slower than their associates for any number of
reasons, and there is no single strategy that energizes all of
them. For example, some work slowly because they are rather
compulsive, some have a fear of making a mistake, while others may
be trying to get back at management.
</P>
<P>
   Discuss this employee's performance with him and let him know
the kinds of problems that his pace is causing, while adding some
suggestions to help him work more expeditiously. Ask him what he
thinks he can do to speed things up, and let him know there are
consequences if the delays continue. If he can commit to some
specific steps to work faster, you may see some improvement.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of the larger picture, you may want to review the kinds
of assignments he is given and consider building the job more
around his strengths. It can also help to monitor his performance
more closely and give him direct guidance as to when and how to
step it up a notch.

SPORTS COLUMN: JETS WILL BENEFIT WHEN ELWAY OPENS THE DOOR
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ As a quarterback, John Elway has had to make football
decisions all his life. When and where to pass, when and where not
to pass, when to scramble, when to surrender to the sack. But now
he's about to make a quality-of-life decision: retire as a two-time
Super Bowl-winning quarterback or return next season at age 39 and
try to help the Denver Broncos win a record third straight Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be nice to three-peat,'' he said Monday, ``but it'd be
nice to walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   And if John Elway were to depart on top, he would walk into the
same sunset that Michael Jordan did recently, that Sandy Koufax did
in 1966 as baseball's best pitcher, that Jim Brown did in 1965
after leading the National Football League in rushing, that Rocky
Marciano did in 1956 as the world heavyweight champion with a 49-0
record.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair to the Broncos' plans, Elway knows he must make up
his mind by the April draft of college talent.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike most retire-or-not decisions that affect only that
athlete's team, Elway's decision will affect every other Super Bowl
contender in the American Football Conference, especially the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   If Elway resumes his career, the Broncos again will be the AFC
team to beat to get to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But if Elway isn't wearing his No. 7 jersey next season, the
Broncos won't be the same and the AFC door to the Super Bowl will
be wide open, with the Jets first in line after their 12-4 season
that ended with their 23-10 fumble of the AFC title in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos Coach Mike Shanahan, of course, is already talking about
how ``there's no reason we can't do it again,'' even without Elway.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan indicated that Bubby Brister, the backup who was 4-0 as
a starter this season when Elway was out with hamstring and rib
damage, would be the No. 1 quarterback on the Broncos' depth chart,
ahead of young Brian Griese and Jeff Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't come back,'' Elway said, ``Bubby can step in.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's Elway the teammate talking, just as it's Shanahan the
coach talking. You know they're going to tout Brister and the young
quarterbacks. But over Brister's checkered career with the
Steelers, the Eagles and the Jets before he joined the Broncos, he
never did anywhere near what Elway did.
</P>
<P>
   Bubby Brister is not John Elway; for all of Brister's success as
a backup, being the starter is a different deal.
</P>
<P>
   If the Broncos know Elway isn't returning, Shanahan might even
try to trade up in the April draft in order to obtain an early
first-round choice and snatch one of the touted quarterbacks coming
out of college. They might also trade for an experienced
quarterback to support, or even supplant Brister.
</P>
<P>
   If Brister is the Broncos' quarterback next season, the Broncos
might still be good enough to win the AFC West, but they won't be
anywhere near as good a team as they were with Elway at
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Without Elway, the Broncos would return to the pack in the AFC,
with the Jets and the Jaguars suddenly the best of the rest, with
the Bills, the Dolphins, the Patriots, the Steelers and maybe the
Seahawks, now organized and coached by Mike Holmgren, the other
playoff contenders.
</P>
<P>
   What also makes Elway's decision different? He's the only Super
Bowl-winning quarterback to be contemplating retirement while
basking as its most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't play, it'll be hard,'' he said. ``All my life,
Saturday and Sundays in the fall are all about football. That
scares me because it's an unknown. I think football is the greatest
game in the world. I know I'll never be comfortable without being
around football.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Elway did a year ago, he will discuss his decision with
his wife, Janet, and their four children, ages 13 to 9. Last spring
their vote was 5-0 for him to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife's my hero,'' he said. ``And I'll talk to the kids, but
they've got to be home, which they never are. No absentee ballots.
I'll talk to Mike and I'll talk to Pat Bowlen, the Broncos' owner.
There's a 90 percent chance I won't play, but I don't want to close
the door.''
</P>
<P>
   If and when John Elway does close the door on his career, he
will be opening the AFC door, and the Jets will be happy to walk
through it. &QL;

<P>
   If you want to have a baby born on New Year's Day, at the dawn
of the millennium, the day to get busy is April 9, the author of
``Making Babies'' told a New Zealand newspaper. You should know,
however, that even if the timing of conception is precise, the baby
has only a 6 percent chance of being born on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Richard Fisher &LR;  said would-be New Year's fathers should have
plenty of sex beforehand, &LR;  because ``the best sperm is fresh sperm.
... It's like ice cream and chocolate. The nearer it is to being
manufactured, the better it is.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - A granddaughter of &UR; Pablo Picasso &LR;  is furious with her uncle
 &UR; Claude &LR; , who signed a contract that will allow PSA Peugeot Citroen
to name a soon-to-be-introduced minivan after the painter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot accept that the name of my grandfather, and of my
father, be used to sell a car,''  &UR; Marina Picasso &LR;  told Le Parisien.
``We have paid heavily for rights,'' said a Citroen representative.
``Our agreement is legally binding.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Steve Waye &LR; , a patron of Manivahn Thai restaurant on 24th
Street in San Francisco, says the place doesn't encourage
overeating. The menu lists ``Fried glutton with vegetables in a red
curry sauce.''
</P>
<P>
   - MSNBC's  &UR; Jeannette Walls  &LR; reports that  &UR; Elizabeth Hurley &LR; 's
photo spread in the latest issue of Details has gotten her into
trouble with Estee Lauder cosmetics, for whom she toils. In one
typical picture, she's smoking a cigarette and grabbing her crotch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Estee Lauder has poured millions into positioning this woman
as elegant, sophisticated and sweet,'' a cosmetics business maven
told Walls. ``She's in these ads with fields of flowers and Lab
puppies. Then she goes and poses for some magazine looking like
 &UR; Courtney Love &LR; 's sluttier older sister. ... They're saying she
better clean up her act or there's talk that they might not renew
her contract.''
</P>
<P>
   - Why don't we all chip in for the Olympics? Despite recent
unfavorable publicity, a reader received a solicitation letter last
week from the U.S. Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   - Metallica drummer &UR; Lars Ulrich  &LR; told Rolling Stone that when
his band plays with the San Francisco Symphony in April, it's
possible that ``Metallica will be in black tie and the orchestra
will be in black leather.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Pierce Brosnan &LR; , 47, used a body double 16 years younger in a
rear-revealing scene he recently shot for a James Bond movie.
</P>
<P>
   - Drinks and more, as reported in Luxe: Perrier is introducing
the Source Perrier Collection, which includes furniture and table
accessories; and the new Johnnie Walker Collection for men contains
casual clothing, some of it in a signature plaid.
</P>
<P>
   - Twenty-nine percent of us, says Vogue, would like to change
our heights.
</P>
<P>
   - Time to sell those Beanie Babies, if this note from Publishers
Weekly is any indication: A first edition of ``The Bridges of
Madison County,'' valued at $225 in 1994, went for $130 this year.
</P>
<P>
   - The always-sexy Cosmopolitan magazine is launching an edition
for teenagers, says New York magazine.
</P>
<P>
   - Strange stickerfellows spotted by  &UR; Chuck Oey  &LR; on a pickup
truck in Redwood City: On the driver's side, ``Mean people produce
little mean people.'' On the passenger side, ``Bite me.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; THE FAT NECK BRIGADE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with  &UR; Tom Hanks &LR; ? Nothing at all, it seemed, until
the mean old New York Observer had its say: ``Tom Hanks has got a
fat neck. A really fat one.''
</P>
<P>
   Essayist  &UR; Andrew Goldman &LR; 's little list of fat-necked
celebrities also includes  &UR; Jay McInerney &LR; ,  &UR; Richard Simmons &LR; ,
 &UR; George Michael &LR; ,  &UR; Marilyn Manson &LR; , &UR; Neve Campbell &LR; ,  &UR; Bill Bradley &LR; ,
 &UR; David Lee Roth  &LR; and  &UR; Al Gore &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore does not have a fat neck,'' a White House official
(who seems to have protected his job by refusing to let his name be
used) told Goldman. ``He has a small head.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``You have to be able to see things from the other &LR; 
 &UR; person's shoes, and I did not do that.'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; David Howard &LR; , who resigned his position in Washington, D.C.,
city government after colleagues complained about his use of the
word ``niggardly.'' Howard's comment, from a New York Times
interview, was gleaned by Carolyn Hall.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``I love money. I could make more beautiful objects if I had &LR; 
 &UR; more money. But if you think about it too much, then it doesn't &LR; 
 &UR; help your art.'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Architect  &UR; Philip Johnson &LR; , 92, in Esquire magazine.

LIBERTY MUTUAL DEAL WITH GUARDIAN ROYAL SEALED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: N.H., N.Y., Ind., Ohio, Wis.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Liberty Mutual Group sealed a pact Monday to acquire
part of British insurer Guardian Royal Exchange Plc for $1.47
billion, in a transaction that expands and diversifies the
Boston-based insurer's core operations.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, the latest evidence of the consolidation sweeping the
insurance industry, gives Liberty the British company's US
operations, which include eight property and casualty insurance
subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition was part of a larger deal, also sealed Monday,
that saw French insurer AXA Group buy the whole of Guardian Royal,
or GRE, for $5.6 billion. AXA's British arm, known as Sun Life and
Provincial Holdings Plc, then sold GRE's US franchises to Liberty.
Both deals had been expected.
</P>
<P>
   For Liberty Mutual, the transaction is part of a strategy
launched earlier this decade to become less dependent on workers'
compensation, in which it is one of the world's biggest players.
That type of insurance is part of the property and casualty
business, in which Liberty is the nation's eighth largest
competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major step in our strategy to diversify risk and
capture added market share,'' said Fred G. Marziano, Liberty's
president of commercial insurance holdings. The newly acquired
units become part of Marziano's group.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. represented Liberty Mutual in the deal,
which is expected to close in the second quarter. The purchase adds
$1.3 billion in premiums to Liberty's $61 billion in assets under
management.
</P>
<P>
   Guardian Royal's US operations include Peerless Insurance of
Keene, N.H.; Indiana Insurance Co. of Indianapolis; and other
regionally-focused companies across New York, Ohio, and Wisconsin.
The units, which will retain their names, provide property and
casualty insurance products to small companies and private
individuals, and give Liberty broader distribution channels.
</P>
<P>
   Marziano said there would be no layoffs.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hailing a new era of budgetary abundance, President
Clinton proposed a budget for 2000 on Monday that he called a
``progressive but prudent path to our future,'' but which
Republicans immediately attacked as a throwback to an earlier age
of liberal largesse.
</P>
<P>
   The president said his $1.766 trillion plan would insure the
solvency of Social Security and Medicare for decades while
proposing billions of dollars in paid-up programs for schools,
cities, families, the environment and the military.
</P>
<P>
   Before the black ink could dry on Clinton's budget submission,
Republican leaders in Congress complained that the president was
shortchanging taxpayers by devoting billions in surplus government
revenues to new programs rather than tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders signaled a willingness on Monday to work with
Clinton to reserve nearly two-thirds of future surpluses to
strengthen Social Security. But there the agreement ends, as the
fiscal debate in Washington shifts from a debate over how to deal
with deficits to an argument over how to allocate budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's budget ambitiously spends almost every cent of
the surplus not set aside for Social Security reform on more
Washington-based programs,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert of
Illinois. ``Clearly, the president sees the surplus as an
opportunity to expand the power, the influence and the size of the
federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   The president and Republican leaders staked out their opening
positions on Monday for the budget process of public hearings and
backroom deals. In recent years, budgets have been fashioned in a
frenzy of last-minute bargaining in the fall that resulted in
spending plans that bore little relationship to the proposals
introduced nine months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   For the White House, the politicking began on Monday in a
triumphal ceremony in the East Room. Unveiling his budget for the
fiscal year beginning next Oct. 1, the president painted a rosy
vision of a future in which the American economy is insulated
against domestic recession or foreign shocks by setting aside a
large portion of $4.47 trillion in projected surpluses over the
next 15 years to reduce the federal debt from the current level of
44 percent of gross domestic product to just 7 percent in 2014, the
lowest level of public debt since 1917.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a rare opportunity that comes along once in a blue
moon to any group of Americans,'' Clinton said to an audience of
White House officials, cabinet officers and members of Congress.
``Fiscal discipline has transformed the vicious cycle of budget
deficits and high interest rates into a virtuous cycle of budget
surpluses and low interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration's spending plan is the first in more than a
generation to be written from the comfort of a year that just ended
in surplus. It projects continued low inflation and moderate
economic growth over the next five years. The unemployment rate is
projected to rise slightly in 1999 and 2000 and remain at 5.3
percent over the following four years. The current jobless rate is
4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget plan projects federal tax receipts of $1.883
trillion in 2000 and spending of $1.766 trillion, producing a
projected surplus of $117 billion. All of that surplus would be
reserved, pending a deal on saving Social Security. The president's
plan expects that deal in the next year and calls for Social
Security to receive 62 percent of the steadily growing projected
surplus for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The White House projects a surplus of $393 billion in 2009, a
remarkable turnaround from the $290 billion deficit Clinton
inherited when he took office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our economic house is in order and strong,'' Clinton said.
``If we manage the surplus right, we can uphold our responsibility
to future generations. We can do so by dedicating the lion's share
of the surplus to saving Social Security and Medicare and paying
down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can,'' Clinton continued, ``and because we can, we must do
it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's robust economy has brought a flood of tax revenue to
Washington, but Clinton would use none of it in the fiscal year
2000 for new programs. He finds ways to pay for dozens of programs
and tax breaks within the constraints of the 1997 Balanced Budget
Agreement by proposing to raise billions of dollars through tax
increases, mostly on business and tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   The president has rejected Republican demands for an
across-the-board tax cut, proposing instead a series of narrowly
drawn tax credits for specific policy purposes. Clinton proposes
$4.1 billion in targeted tax relief for 2000 and $32.6 billion in
tax reductions in the five years 2000 to 2004. The proposed tax
incentives include new credits for long-term health care, a new
subsidy for stay-at-home parents of young children and expanded
benefits for other child care expenses, tax breaks for a variety of
environmental initiatives, incentives for school construction and
new research and development programs.
</P>
<P>
   The president also proposes significant spending increases on
education, including $1.4 billion for hiring new teachers and $965
million for job retraining and adult literacy programs. The
administration budget also calls for $1 billion to buy parkland and
reduce traffic congestion and urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   To pay for these proposals, federal budgeteers scoured the tax
code to find $33.4 billion in new revenue over the next five years
by closing corporate tax loopholes and disallowing various tax
shelters, imposing environmental charges on oil and mining
concerns, taxing certain life insurance transactions and rewriting
sales-tax rules for exporters. Many of these revenue-raising
proposals have been rejected by Congress several times.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is also counting on $54 billion in revenue
from smokers and tobacco companies: a new 55-cents-a-pack cigarette
tax that is expected to raise $34.5 billion over the next five
years and a plan to recover $18.9 billion in Medicaid
reimbursements to states that federal officials contend will be
paid by tobacco companies under legal settlements with the states
worth $246 billion.
</P>
<P>
   From 2001 onward, Clinton would devote 62 percent of future
surpluses for Social Security and 15 percent for Medicare. The rest
would be used to help middle-income taxpayers save for retirement
and to pay for increased spending on the Pentagon and social
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, said Clinton's budget squanders a
historic opportunity to reduce taxes for all Americans, rather than
for favored Democratic constituencies and special interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the tax burden on the American people is at an
all-time high _ higher than during World War II,'' Armey, the House
majority leader, said. ``If we can't cut taxes now, when can we?''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials acknowledged that the president's
budget proposals _particularly the new spending and tax measures _
are unlikely to survive in anything like their current form.
</P>
<P>
   They also said that Clinton's plan to reserve 77 percent of
future surpluses to shore up Social Security and Medicare until
2055 was subject to negotiation with the Republican majority in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, the president has not said that this should be
the end of the discussion; this is the beginning of the
discussion,'' said Jack Lew, the White House budget director,
offering a pointed challenge to Congress. ``If there's an
alternative to get to 2055 that is capable of reaching bipartisan
support, we would like to see that alternative.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress were unable to agree last year on
competing tax-cut proposals, with the result that no major tax
relief was approved. But, for now at least, Republicans in both
houses appear united in their determination to pass a big tax-cut
bill and send it to Clinton for his signature.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., who chairs the Senate Budget
Committee, said he was willing to go along with Clinton's proposal
to reserve 62 percent of future surpluses for Social Security. But
while Clinton wants to use the remaining excess funds for Medicare,
a new form of retirement account for middle-income taxpayers and
additional social and military spending, Domenici wants to return
the money to the public in the form of tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici said he believes Congress will approve a large,
across-the-board tax cut and predicted that Clinton would sign it.
``What's changed,'' he said, ``is we have a bona fide surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, likened Clinton to Santa Claus,
bringing gifts for every constituency from the overflowing budget.
But Kasich, chairman of the House Budget Committee, warned Clinton
against surplus-generated generosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to blow this by spending it on Big
Government,'' Kasich said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While Monica Lewinsky testified just a few blocks
away, President Clinton reveled Monday in a White House ceremony,
rolling out a $1.8 trillion budget for the year 2000 and trumpeting
a new era of American prosperity and surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beneath the glimmering chandeliers of the ornate East
Room, Clinton challenged Congress to sweep aside populist calls for
tax cuts and spending hikes and use the fruits of good times to
shore up Social Security and Medicare, help low-income families
save and pay down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   He called on the country to devote nearly $4 trillion to those
efforts over the next 15 years, saying the country's next
generation deserves the chance to embark on a new century
''unshackled'' by the ''profligacy,'' that left the nation deeply
in debt.
</P>
<P>
   The details for those plans, expected to frame the key
legislative battles over the remainder of Clinton's term, were part
of the budget proposal Clinton sent up to Congress on Monday,
mapping out how he hopes the government raises and spends nearly
$1.8 trillion during the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's budget proposals set the stage for an epic face-off
between Clinton and his Democratic allies in Congress and their
Republican foes, many of whom have already called for
across-the-board income tax reductions of between 10 percent and 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton argued, however, that the current generation of
Americans has an obligation to set aside some of its unprecedented
wealth to pour the foundations for continued growth well into the
next century.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a rare opportunity that comes along once in a blue
moon to any group of Americans,'' Clinton said, extolling the
benefits of eight years of unprecedented economic growth and the
chance to harness those blessings to solve long-term ills.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not just about saving Social Security and Medicare,''
Clinton said. ''It is also about knowing that when we leave this
century and enter the next, we have given our children 20 years or
so in which they can worry about the challenges of the future ...
unburdened by the unfinished business of the 20th century,
unshackled by our profligacy in the latter part of this century.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton spoke, Lewinsky, the former White House intern at the
center of the sex and deception scandal that led to Clinton's
impeachment in December, was being questioned in a luxury suite at
the nearby Mayflower Hotel in connection with his Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ignored his impeachment woes and reached back instead to
the economic themes that first carried him to the presidency in
1992, declaring complete victory in his efforts to lead the country
away from three decades of deficit spending that left the country
$5.5 trillion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   ''Seven years ago, when I ran for president, I committed to put
our fiscal house in order,'' Clinton said to an enthusiastic
roomful of cabinet members, Congressional Democrats and senior
budget staff members.
</P>
<P>
   ''America is on course for surpluses over the next quarter
century,'' Clinton declared. ''Our economic house is in order and
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government took in $70 billion more than it spent
last year, the first time since 1969 the budget wasn't in the red.
The White House estimates that the surplus will top $79 billion
this year, rise to $117 billion in fiscal 2000 and continue
spiraling upward.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 15 years, the administration estimates, the
surpluses will total more than $4.4 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Clinton's budget proposal is a plan to set aside
62 percent of the surplus, or $2.7 trillion, to shore up Social
Security, the massive federal retirement insurance program that
pays monthly benefits checks to one in every six Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Some $500 billion of that money would be invested in the stock
market, under Clinton's plan, exposing a small portion of the
Social Security program to both the risks and rewards of Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining $2.2 trillion would be funneled into the Social
Security trust fund, which would, in turn, loan the money to the
Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury would then use the money to pay down part of the
publicly-held portion of the federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $5.5 trillion federal debt, about $3.7 trillion is
publicly-held, meaning it is owed to individual investors and
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The interest payments on that debt are huge; they cost taxpayers
$243 billion last year alone.
</P>
<P>
   Government borrowing to finance the debt also crowds out private
borrowers from capital markets, putting upward pressure on interest
rates, a dynamic that's reversed when government borrowing
declines.
</P>
<P>
   By borrowing money from the Social Security trust fund, one part
of the government is, in essence, obligated to pay back a loan to
another. Interest payments become an accounting exercise, not a
taxpayer burden, and no longer show up on the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan, as outlined, wouldn't actually reduce the gross
national debt. The money, after all, would still be owed, only it
would be obligated, in effect, to Social Security beneficiaries
instead of banks and portfolio holders.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration claims, however, that the plan would
have the effect of locking in place future surpluses and imposing
fiscal discipline upon Congress, while dramatically reducing
taxpayers' interest payments.
</P>
<P>
   ''The appeal of this strategy of using Social Security as a
lockbox is that it scales dramatically down the burden of the debt
on the public, in terms of investment, and on the federal budget in
terms of interest,'' said Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers. ''That makes room and provides the capacity to meet, in a
much more satisfactory way, the other obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that, eventually, Democrats and Republicans would be
able to agree on long-term Social Security reform _ some
combination of raising premiums and reducing benefits _ in a way
that would free up additional money to accelerate the retirement of
the overall debt.
</P>
<P>
   ''Social Security reform makes that possible,'' said Summers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget also calls for making $536 billion available
over the coming 15 years to finance subsidized savings accounts for
low-income workers, and it would channel some $660 billion into
Medicare, the government health insurance plan that helps retirees
and disabled workers pay their medical bills.

SLIM CLUE EMERGES IN CASE OF MISSING ATHEIST 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Danny Fry, a Florida man who went to Texas in 1995
looking for a big score, may have played a role in one of the
century's most baffling celebrity disappearances.
</P>
<P>
   Fry may also provide the authorities with a clue to missing
atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair, who vanished from San Antonio in
September 1995 with her two adult children and $500,000 in gold
coins.
</P>
<P>
   Fry spent that month in San Antonio and he disappeared the same
weekend as the O'Hairs.
</P>
<P>
   Although the O'Hairs' fate remains an enigma, Fry's has become
chillingly clear.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic testing completed last week has determined a nude and
mutilated body that was dumped Oct. 2, 1995, in southeastern Dallas
County was the missing Florida man.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly was a cocky bastard who did this. The way they
laid him out was like, `Come and find us,''' said Robert Bjorklund,
a Dallas County sheriff's detective.
</P>
<P>
   The corpse, minus crudely amputated head and hands, was found
that fall afternoon in 1995 by a man collecting aluminum cans on a
trash-strewn riverbank near Seagoville.
</P>
<P>
   The body was placed chest-up, legs neatly together and arms
splayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't they dump him in the water? It would have been a
whole lot harder to find,'' said Bjorklund, who reviewed more than
200 missing-persons cases in an effort to identify the headless
man.
</P>
<P>
   But without tattoos, scars, dental records or fingerprints, the
police were stumped.
</P>
<P>
   The search ended when DNA tests, using blood obtained from Fry's
brother, ex-wife and son, matched a genetic sample taken before the
headless corpse went to a pauper's grave.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is confirmed that our homicide victim is Danny Fry. The
probability ... is 99.99 percent,'' Bjorklund said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives think Fry, 42, was murdered earlier on Oct. 2, 1995.
The body held few clues, and Fry's clothing, head and hands have
not been found.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fry investigation could break loose the logjammed O'Hair
case.
</P>
<P>
   A three-year global search for the famous atheist has yielded
little more than rumors and speculation. Some believe O'Hair, her
son Jon Garth Murray and adopted daughter, Robin, were murdered for
the gold they bought in late September 1995, using money wired from
an account in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of her sudden disappearance, O'Hair, 76, was
suffering from diabetes and heart trouble. Her role in national
atheist affairs had become marginal.
</P>
<P>
   It was a long slide from her prominence decades ago during the
legal battles over Bible reading and prayer in public schools, and
the Supreme Court decisions in the early 1960s that banned them.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair, who once proclaimed herself ``the most hated woman in
America,'' relished conflict with the believers of any rank or
stripe, from the local Baptist preacher to the pope.
</P>
<P>
   One link between the Fry and the O'Hair cases is an Austin man,
David Waters, an ex-convict who knew Fry and had worked as office
manager of O'Hair's atheist organizations in Austin in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Waters, 48, has convictions for murder, forgery, battery and
theft.
</P>
<P>
   The last one came in 1995 after he admitted stealing $54,000
from the O'Hair organizations. Now on probation, Waters is making
monthly restitution payments.
</P>
<P>
   Waters thinks the O'Hairs took the money and ran, and he denies
any knowledge of their fate. He also said he had no knowledge of
Fry's disappearance and murder and recalls only a passing encounter
with him in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The two men had worked together in Florida a few years earlier,
and Waters said they became reacquainted when Fry called that
summer asking about work in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan contacted me. I did tell him if he was interested in
getting ahead, Austin was hot. I said the unemployment rate is 3.2
percent. If you want to get something going, this is the place to
be,'' Waters recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Waters said he allowed Fry to stay in his apartment sometime in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stayed here a couple of weeks,'' Waters said. ``I know he
was having some personal problems. I got the impression he was
trying to get away from things for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Waters said Fry stayed in Austin a little while, drinking and
gambling, and, after no job materialized, moved on, never to
surface again.
</P>
<P>
   Fry's relatives confirm the man was a heavy drinker and a big
talker when he had a few too many. And they say he wasn't too
particular about how he made his money, as long as the payoff was
good.
</P>
<P>
   But they say Fry never would have gone to Texas unless he had
work lined up.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was the type where there had to be some money to be
made to go to Texas, and Waters was the only person he knew
there,'' said Fry's son, D.J.
</P>
<P>
   Family members dispute Waters' statement that his association
with Fry was brief. Phone records indicate a longer and deeper
relationship between the two men.
</P>
<P>
   When Fry failed to return to Florida in early October 1995 as he
had promised, his fiancee, children and brother say they began
calling Waters in Austin for information. But they said he was
unhelpful.
</P>
<P>
   Fry's older brother, Bob, said Waters took a more active
interest in the matter about a week after Danny Fry vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Fry said the events were triggered when he called Waters
from Florida and mentioned a letter Danny had sent from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The letter said that if he wasn't back by a certain date, that
meant something serious had happened. I should contact the
authorities and bring in Dave Waters name, that Dave Waters planned
what we did,'' recalled Bob.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Waters and told him about the letter. I had already
destroyed it, but I just told him I had an unopened letter,'' Bob
Fry recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Fry said things happened quickly after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Hold onto it. I'm sure he'll show up. I just talked
to him the night before last from a bar in Dallas. He was drunk,'''
Bob Fry said.
</P>
<P>
   By the next evening, Bob Fry said, Waters and a second man were
on his doorstep in Florida, demanding the letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me they were involved with something really heavy in
Texas, and the people who planned it wanted them to get the letter
back. And if they didn't, the people would come and get it, and
they wouldn't be as nice,'' Bob Fry recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Fry said the two men finally left after he convinced them
the letter was already destroyed. But, he said, their words
lingered.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing Waters said keeps haunting me. He said, `Your
brother drinks a lot. He's got a big mouth,''' Bob Fry recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Waters denied the encounter with Bob Fry took place.

<P>
   SHENZHEN, China _ Priced at $58, the Rolex watch in the store
window here was a pretty good deal.
</P>
<P>
   It was a fake, to be sure. But as the eager shopkeeper pointed
out, ``The parts were made in Switzerland.'' And a genuine Rolex
would set you back $2,842 in a jewelry shop across the border in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Name your price,'' the young woman implored, when the
shopper's gaze drifted to a rack of handbags next door. ``Please,''
she said in a plaintive tone as phony as her merchandise, ``I
haven't had any business today.''
</P>
<P>
   Every day, an estimated 90,000 people travel by train or bus
from Hong Kong across the border to Shenzhen, a raucous boom town
of thrusting skyscrapers and bottom-feeding nightclubs. Many head
straight for Lo Wu Commercial City, a giant shopping mall devoted
almost entirely to imitation luxury goods.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Sunday, crowds surged through the mall's maze of
corridors, mobbing hundreds of tiny stores selling fake Rolex
watches, Gucci shoes, Fendi clothing, Prada bags, and Chanel
wallets. While women rummaged through piles of merchandise, their
husbands loitered outside, knee-deep in shopping bags. As shoppers
elbowed one another aside for coveted items, scuffles broke out.
</P>
<P>
   With five floors and 500,000 square feet of retail space, Lo Wu
may be the world capital of counterfeit goods. Alarmingly for some,
it is also just 45 minutes away from the gilded boutiques of Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're obviously very concerned _ we're also very
disillusioned,'' said Kevin Ching, the executive director of
Dickson Concepts, a retail company that distributes Polo, Rolex and
other upscale brands in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Lo Wu was built in 1994 to capitalize on the closer ties between
China and Hong Kong as the 1997 handover of the British colony to
China's rule approached. But it has become a rage among Hong Kong
people in the last six months, as the Asian recession has suddenly
made designer brands seem unaffordable. For many label-crazy Hong
Kongers, shopping at Lo Wu is the only way to keep up appearances
in hard times.
</P>
<P>
   The sales clerks, many of them poor migrants from rural China,
said they have waited on some rather well-heeled Hong Kong ladies.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Kwok, a Hong Kong resident who is married to an executive
at Hyatt Hotels, said she had made six pilgrimages to Shenzhen to
buy sunglasses and handbags, and to have clothing tailored. Though
she said she could afford Gucci or Fendi sunglasses, she said she
felt uneasy about such conspicuous consumption given the current
downturn in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole attitude has changed in the last year,'' said Ms.
Kwok, 39, as she sat in her spacious apartment overlooking Hong
Kong harbor and petted her white poodle. ``People go up there
because they get a great kick out of buying something for a
fraction of what it costs in Hong Kong.''
</P>
<P>
   For Hong Kong's purveyors of luxury goods, like Ching, those are
chilling words. After years of pleading with the local Customs and
Excise Department to crack down on the sale of counterfeit goods in
the territory, Ching now must worry about his clients taking their
dollars across the border (Shenzhen's shops have few mainland
customers and generally accept only Hong Kong dollars).
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong government has aggressively raided illegal shops
and factories in its own territory, but Ching said China had made
little headway in the fight against fakes on the mainland, whether
compact discs or Gucci wallets.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Hong Kong, if you complain enough, they'll take action,
stage some high-profile raids, make a few arrests,'' Ching said.
``But in China, these things are just so rampant, and the law
enforcement is so spotty.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the local authorities have been waging an uphill battle
against counterfeits in the Lo Wu mall. In early January, officials
from the Shenzhen Trade and Industry Bureau raided two shops and
seized 80 fake handbags. But the campaign has hardly dented the
mall's bustling commerce.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the officials do not work on weekends, which means
the shopkeepers are not bothered during the two busiest days of the
week. Some stores stock two sets of products _ with and without
trademarks _ and stash the fakes in plastic bags when there is a
risk of a raid. Even when officials conduct sweeps during the week,
their arrival rarely surprises or ruffles the shopkeepers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just close the door and wait until they go away,'' said one
sales clerk in her mid-20s who would give her name only as Ms.
Wang. Sometimes, the shoppers huddle behind the door along with the
salespeople.
</P>
<P>
   When the shoppers return home, they are subject to Hong Kong
law, under which it is illegal to import goods with a forged
trademark. But the law has loopholes: If a person does not know the
goods are counterfeit, or does not plan to resell them, then the
person is not subject to prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong officials recently arrested two women at the border
for carrying 200 leather bags, which they said they intended to
resell. So far this year, officials have carried out 14 seizures of
counterfeit items compared with 38 in all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But a Hong Kong Customs spokesman, Richard Law, conceded that
officials could not rifle through the bags of every person they
suspected of carrying fakes. On a recent Sunday, most shoppers were
not checked _ even those carrying bulging bags and hauling
brand-new suitcases.
</P>
<P>
   For all its gritty novelty, some observers predicted that people
will stop shopping for knock-offs in China as soon as they start
feeling flush again. They say that with its surly crowds, dim
lighting and cramped shops, Lo Wu will lose its appeal among Hong
Kong's well-manicured shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Ching is among those who dearly hope that Hong Kong's consumer
snobbery will eventually put Lo Wu out of business. But he worries
that the quality of the counterfeits _ most of which are made in
China and South Korea _ has become too good. People may be
reluctant to pay $387 for a genuine Prada backpack when the $19
imitation is virtually identical.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, he said, there was the primal rush of knowing one can
buy something for next to nothing _ a thrill to which he himself is
not immune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was great fun,'' said Ching, after spending a day
at Lo Wu recently. ``I was tempted, too. Of course, I would be
fired if my boss caught me walking around with a fake Polo bag.''

U.S. SEES PROGRESS IN TALKS WITH INDIA ON SIGNING TEST BAN TREATY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CELIA W. DUGGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ American officials said Monday that there was
momentum now for a choreographed sequence of steps that would lead
to a substantial easing of economic sanctions imposed on India
after its nuclear tests in May, as well as to India's signing of
the test ban treaty, probably by mid-year.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians were more cautious in their assessment of the
outcome of three days of negotiations that ended Sunday _ the
eighth round of talks since the tests. But both Indian and American
diplomats were optimistic about resolving their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from both countries said they also hoped more broadly
for an improvement in the prickly, mistrustful relations between
the United States and India. An Indian official described the tone
of conversations between Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott
and External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh as ``verging on
bonhomie.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States took a step in this diplomatic tango Monday by
inviting ambassadors from the major industrialized democracies and
Russia, known as the Group of 8, or G-8, to a luncheon in New
Delhi, where Americans broached the resumption of World Bank
lending to India for road, power and other development projects.
Sanctions have thus far cost India about $1.2 billion in World Bank
loans, bank officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States cannot act alone,'' said a senior Clinton
administration official, who, like all the officials interviewed,
refused to be quoted by name. ``It must move in tandem with the
other G-8 partners.''
</P>
<P>
   An Indian official said a decision to allow World Bank lending
to resume would be ``a small step toward the creation of a positive
atmosphere.'' Another Indian official said there was no explicit
agreement that if the United States takes certain specific actions
on sanctions, India will sign the test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's too mechanical a spin,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While both the Indians and Americans insisted that they have
done nothing so crude as horse-trading during eight rounds of talks
in eight months, it is clear that each side has certain conditions
that must be met before relations improve. India's decision to
conduct the underground nuclear tests, which Pakistan immediately
followed with its own nuclear tests, brought the relationship to
one of its lowest points ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian government, run by a seemingly ever-shakier coalition
led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, needs
something concrete it can claim to have gained for signing the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty by the September deadline for
ratification set by a United Nations conference more than two years
ago, party leaders have said. The government cannot be seen as
giving in to American pressure without opening itself up to attack
from the opposition Congress Party.
</P>
<P>
   The government badly needs some victories. The Hindu
nationalists were routed in state elections in November, in large
part because of the rising prices of vegetables, and they have been
under attack from some of their allies in recent days for raising
the prices of subsidized rice, wheat, sugar and cooking oil to
lower the budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement that India and the United States issued on
Sunday, both said they would ``endeavor to create a positive
atmosphere for advancing their relations.'' Indian officials say
they will work to build a consensus for signing the test ban treaty
when Parliament reconvenes this month.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott Monday visited the Congress Party president, Sonia
Gandhi, and has given interviews to Indian journalists in which he
stresses his respect for India as a great secular democracy and
speaks glowingly of the possibilities of a close relationship
between India and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Indian officials say the United States has taken steps
recently that have soured the atmosphere, for instance backing a
resumption of World Bank lending to Pakistan but not to India.
</P>
<P>
   And they have complained frequently about what they see as the
American government's overly broad use of a law that generally bars
American businesses from trading with Indian companies and
government agencies that are involved in developing India's nuclear
and missile programs. India wants the list of more than 200 Indian
institutions affected by the law to be pruned _ a step that the
Americans described as being ``in play.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States _ and President Clinton personally _ first and
foremost want India to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The
president called Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee on Friday for
the first time since the tests to talk about the treaty and other
goals of American policy.
</P>
<P>
   While recognizing that India will not give up developing what it
calls a ``minimum, credible nuclear deterrent,'' American officials
want it to limit its nuclear program and stop producing
weapons-grade nuclear material. They also want it to keep up talks
with Pakistan to reduce tensions between the countries.
</P>
<P>
   American officials are to meet with Pakistani diplomats in
Pakistan on Tuesday, but declined to discuss the agenda. Their next
round of talks with India are expected to take place in the middle
of the year.

SHANAHAN TO PATRIOTS: KEEP UP THE COMMITMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The road to the Super Bowl leads through Foxborough,
Mike Shanahan and John Elway said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly, but at least it passes through Johnny
Parker's weight room.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 12 hours after Shanahan's Broncos repeated as Super
Bowl champions by destroying the dreams of Dan Reeves and the
Atlanta Falcons, the Denver coach and his quarterback were standing
at podiums in downtown Miami discussing how this had come about and
what it would take to become the first team in NFL history to
three-peat in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Their conclusion was the same, and it was simple.
</P>
<P>
   Go to work when everyone else is resting. Go to work in March
and April and May when others play golf and go to the beach and
make excuses for their absences. Go where too few Patriots went
last winter and spring.
</P>
<P>
   Go to the weight room. Go to the film room. Go to work.
</P>
<P>
   When Shanahan spoke to his players following their 34-19
annihilation of the Falcons, he congratulated them on a job well
done but immediately followed that by saying the new season would
begin Monday. He was kidding, of course, but not by much.
</P>
<P>
   While other coaches compliment half-hearted effort, Shanahan is
a hard realist. Minutes after winning the Super Bowl, he already
was demanding a deeper commitment than he had a year ago from his
Broncos. While some apologists for Pete Carroll's Patriots minimize
the importance of consistent offseason workouts, one of the best
coaches in pro football argued forcefully the other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to be the best during the season,'' Shanahan
said. ``It's what you do in the offseason that makes the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't surprised at the success we had this year because of
the commitment we've had in the offseason. I'm hoping we have the
same thing again because people will pat us on the back and talk
about dynasties and I hope we don't swallow it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we talked about after the game was that we snuck up on
some people last year. We surprised some people. That's why I'm so
proud of this team this year. We knew we were not going to surprise
anybody. That's why we had the offseason we had. John has had that
commitment for 16 years.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that commitment, or at least the need for it to be truly
successful in the NFL these days, that may yet drive Elway into
retirement even though he could become the first quarterback in NFL
history to win three straight Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Normally such a challenge would be more than enough to bring a
man as competitive as Elway back to the huddle, but before he can
get there, he knows what is required in the quiet months when few
people are thinking about football.
</P>
<P>
   Elway knows what Shanahan expects of him and will demand of him,
regardless of what the NFL Players Association says about offseason
workouts being voluntary. He also knows he is not yet sure he can
do what winners must do in the NFL to maximize their abilities.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Drew Bledsoe wants to win as much as Elway does.
Carroll wants to win as much as Shanahan does. But who wants to win
in March? That is the question, Elway said Monday, that he must
answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a 90 percent chance I'll be back, but you can't start
in July and expect to have a good year,'' Elway said. ``The season
starts in April. It's a nine-month job. I have to have my mind made
up by April. I don't want to just come back and go through the
motions.''
</P>
<P>
   In the opinion of two champions, two people who have actually
won the Super Bowl rather than just talked about winning it, pro
football is a nine-month job. It is about commitment, the kind of
commitment last year's Patriots simply did not make in the months
when the Broncos were working.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll knows that and any honest observer of the Patriots knows
it as well. The teams that work the hardest in the NFL are the most
successful. It is the same way in most walks of life.
</P>
<P>
   The reporters who use the phone the latest get the story, the
delivery men who drive the longest hours get the promotions, the
construction workers who work the full shift get the building in on
time, the salespeople who make the last call close the deals. Those
are the winners. The ones who work the hardest.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   So there was a message for the Patriots Monday, a message that
was clear and unambiguous. If you don't want to go to work in March
and April and May, then you don't want to be playing in Atlanta
next January when the Super Bowl is held.
</P>
<P>
   It will be up to the Patriots to decide what they want to do
between now and then. It will be up to Carroll to decide how hard
he wants to push them, if he wants to push them at all.
</P>
<P>
   As for Elway and Shanahan, they know what will be demanded in
Denver. There is no guarantee that if they do all that they will
reach the final game again because many things can intervene
between March and January. But this much is sure: If they don't,
it's guaranteed they won't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to come back and go for a three-peat but the question
is whether you can spend the time mentally doing what you need to
do and spend the time physically,'' Elway said. ``That was tough
last year. That was a big haul for me.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a haul John Elway made though he didn't want to, a haul he
knows a player must make for a chance to reach the Super Bowl. If
they want to make that long haul in Foxborough, Pete Carroll's
Patriots might yet have a chance to fight the Denver Broncos for
the AFC's spot in Super Bowl XXXIV next January.
</P>
<P>
   But if they don't, they might as well make vacation plans now
because next January will be wide open for them. Just as it was
this year.

COMMENTARY: THE INVISIBLE MAN  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVOS, Switzerland _ U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers joked the other day that he had a new idea for solving the
problem of Brazil's collapsing currency, the real. He suggested the
Brazilians rename their currency _ ``real.com.'' Judging from U.S.
stock markets, it would double in value every 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   Summers' joke, though, actually captured the most interesting
aspect of this year's Davos World Economic Forum, the annual
gathering in the Swiss Alps of world leaders, business executives
and bankers. Every year at Davos someone stands out as the
trend-setter. This year the stars of Davos were invisible: One was
Amazon.com and the others were the leaders from so many developing
countries who used to come here regularly, but this year didn't
show. And therein lies a story.
</P>
<P>
   Every panel discussion here on the Internet economy was sold
out, and the panel where experts discussed whether the Internet
stocks were ``a bubble'' about to burst was standing room only.
Princeton University economist Alan Blinder kicked off that
discussion by observing that there was probably some bubble quality
to the Internet stock craze, or as he put it: ``I have a general
rule: Whenever something becomes worth more than the whole state of
California, sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, though, the person who poured the coldest water
on the Internet mania was Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, who
said, ``I find the valuations of high-tech stocks in general
surprisingly high.'' Gates argued that the high-tech business today
is so intense, and companies can be overtaken by competition from
so many different directions, that making any assumptions about the
future earnings of any high-tech company _ particularly one on the
Wild West Internet _ is very risky.
</P>
<P>
   But people are missing the most important point about the
Internet stock boom, said Gates. Whether or not it's a bubble, it
is attracting enormous amounts of new venture capital to every
imaginable Internet-related company, and this influx of cash is
going to drive ``the pace of Internet innovation even faster.''
</P>
<P>
   For the global business leaders here, nothing could be more
exciting. But for the other invisible party _ the leaders of
developing countries _ nothing could be more depressing than the
thought that the world will be getting faster. There was a time
when the head of state of a developing country _ such as Thailand
or Mexico _ wouldn't want to miss Davos and the chance to show off
for the big multinationals. It was almost as if by simply coming
here, you were automatically part of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   But in the wake of the meltdowns in Mexico, Russia, Southeast
Asia and Brazil in recent years, a new sobriety is taking hold in
many of these emerging markets. Their leaders are coming to realize
that the answers to their problems are not here. They are at home.
They are starting to realize that it makes no sense to come to
Davos and show off your country if you do not have a financial,
legal and regulatory structure able to handle the Electronic Herd
of global investors. And the only way to get that structure is to
build it yourself from the ground up.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot wait for Godot,'' remarked Noordin Sopiee, one of
Malaysia's leading strategic thinkers. ``We have to solve our
problems at the national level. God help those who expect others to
help them.''
</P>
<P>
   Emad el-Din Adeeb, editor of the Egyptian journal Al Alam Al
Youm, concurred: ``OK,'' he said to me, ``I understand we need to
get prepared for this globalization and that is partly our
responsibility. There is a train that is leaving and we should have
known this and done our homework. But now you should slow the train
a bit and give us a chance to jump on.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's what is scary about this year's Davos: Just when the
developing world is coming to really grasp that it has no choice
but to get itself ready to climb aboard this train, Gates is
predicting that the train is going to get faster _ not slower _ as
the developing world moves toward Internet-based commerce,
communication and learning systems. What's worse, no one can slow
the train down, because the world economy today is just like that
Internet: everybody is connected but nobody is in charge.
</P>
<P>
   As the Deutsche Bank economist Ken Courtis observed: ``The
developing world has decided to catch the train just as it's being
dematerialized and turned into a virtual experience.'' That's not
an easy train to catch. (BOX)

VERNON JORDAN TO TESTIFY ABOUT OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On May 28, 1998, an exhausted Vernon Jordan emerged
from his fourth round of grand jury testimony at the federal
courthouse here to tell reporters: ``I have answered every question
over and over and over again.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Jordan added, he expected he would again be called upon to
answer the ``same questions over and over and over again.''
</P>
<P>
   He got that right.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, it's Jordan's turn to go before House prosecutors
and White House lawyers in a closed-door deposition for the Senate
impeachment trial. He is one of three witnesses to be interviewed
under oath by the prosecutors, mainly because of their theory that
he was a key player in a conspiracy to obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
   For Jordan, Washington superlawyer and President Clinton's
longtime confidant and golfing buddy, the stakes are much higher
than when he made his five grand jury appearances last year.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the two principals of the Monica Lewinsky sex
scandal _ Lewinsky herself and President Clinton _ have appeared
before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Lewinsky's account makes it seem that Jordan knew
a lot more about her affair with Clinton than he said he did during
last year's grand jury appearances.
</P>
<P>
   For example, her testimony undercuts Jordan's contention that
his help in finding her a job was nothing out of the ordinary, and
that he was satisfied with denials by Clinton and Lewinsky that
they had a sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Some key points lawyers on both sides are likely to examine with
Jordan:
</P>
<P>
   1) WHEN HE FIRST MET MONICA LEWINSKY:
</P>
<P>
   Presidential secretary Betty Currie said she arranged Jordan's
first job-search meeting with Lewinsky in November 1998 on her own,
with no direction from Clinton. Clinton's recollection was hazy,
but the president said he didn't think he was the ``precipitating
force'' behind the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Later, around the time when he learned that Lewinsky's name was
on the list of potential witnesses in the Paula Jones civil suit,
Clinton seemed to take a more active role.
</P>
<P>
   When she complained to Clinton in a stormy White House meeting
on Dec. 6, 1998, that Jordan wasn't finding a job for her, Clinton
promised ``I'll get on it,'' according to Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   2) WHAT JORDAN WAS TOLD ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky contacted him on Dec. 19, distraught over receiving a
subpoena in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit. Lewinsky
talked about her feelings for Clinton and Jordan said he felt as
though he were ``listening to a bobby-soxer who was mesmerized by
Frank Sinatra.'' He asked Lewinsky and, later on, Clinton about
whether they had a sexual relationship. Both said no.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said he saw no need to pursue it further. ``Frankly, I
didn't want Monica Lewinsky to tell me anything about her
relationship with the president ... I was satisfied with her
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the subpoena in the Jones case changed his benign
view of why he had been enlisted in the Lewinsky job search, Jordan
replied ``Zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's account, however, suggests Jordan knew a lot more
about the relationship than he was letting on.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 22, Jordan escorted Lewinsky to the office of a criminal
lawyer, Frank Carter. Jordan's recollection of his conversation
that day with Lewinsky was that it involved her job search.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, however, recalled expressing fear that ``someone''
might be listening in on her phone calls to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   When Jordan assured her that wouldn't be a problem, she told
Jordan that she and Clinton had engaged in phone sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what's phone sex?'' Lewinsky quoted Jordan as saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you know what phone sex is,'' Lewinsky replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't,'' Jordan said, according to Lewinsky. ``I'm just
an old man. I don't know what phone sex is.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a Dec. 31 breakfast meeting, Lewinsky asked Jordan if
Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton would always be
together. Jordan answered they would, but maybe she would have an
affair with Clinton some day.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky said she was ``shocked'' that Jordan didn't seem to
know about her relationship with Clinton. She told Jordan the two
already were having an affair, telling him that while ``we didn't
have sex,'' they ``did everything but sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan ``didn't really respond to me,'' Lewinsky said. ``So I
took that as a cue to drop the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors likely will try to exploit these varying
accounts to show Jordan knew the true nature of the relationship,
and that his job assistance was part of Clinton's calculated plan
to buy Lewinsky's silence. Lewinsky, however, has said she was
never promised a job in exchange for her silence.
</P>
<P>
   3) JORDAN AND THE NOTES FROM LEWINSKY TO CLINTON
</P>
<P>
   At the same Dec. 31 meeting, Lewinsky mentioned that she had
drafts of letters to Clinton around her apartment. Jordan urged her
to ``go home and make sure they're not there.'' Later, Lewinsky
discarded about 50 of the notes, she testified. Jordan has never
been asked about this exchange with Lewinsky. Rep. Asa Hutchinson,
R-Ark., the House prosecutor who will question Jordan, told the
Washington Post that Jordan's answers to questions about this
conversation could be ``significant to the case.''
</P>
<P>
   4) JORDAN GOES INTO HIGH GEAR
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998 as Clinton's deposition in the Paula Jones
lawsuit neared, Jordan intensified the job search for Lewinsky. On
Jan. 8, the day after Lewinsky signed an affidavit denying a sexual
relationship with Clinton, Jordan called Ronald Perelman, chairman
of McAndrews &AMP; Forbes Holdings Inc. to ask the powerful executive
to help Lewinsky. Earlier that day, Lewinsky had complained to
Jordan that an interview at Revlon _ a McAndrews &AMP; Forbes
subsidiary _ had not gone well.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Lewinsky had a second interview and was offered a
job. ``I have to assumed the Jordan magic worked,'' Jordan said.
After learning the news, he called Currie and left a message for
Clinton: ``Mission accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House legal team, however, has argued Jordan's
intervention was inconsequential because the Revlon executive who
interviewed Lewinsky the second time and offered her a job was
never told of Jordan's call to Perelman.

TEXAS CITIES SEEKING FUNDING GUARANTEES FOR OLYMPICS BIDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MEDE NIX 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Even though the possibility of an Olympics in Texas is
more than a dozen years away, the state Legislature is being asked
to consider guaranteeing the costs of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio sports officials are pushing a bill by Rep. Art
Reyna, D-San Antonio, that could provide unlimited state guarantees
for funding the city's bid for the 2007 Pan American Games and for
Dallas' and Houston's bids for the 2012 Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can sign a blank check, but we're saying that because
the Pan American Games or the Olympics would enable the state to
have an economic windfall, they should recognize that impact with
this guarantee,'' said Susan Blackwood, executive director of the
San Antonio Sports Foundation. ``There's little risk involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackwood said it is crucial that the Legislature address the
issue in 1999 because San Antonio officials must provide evidence
of the guarantee by October, when the U.S. Olympic Committee will
select the U.S. host city to compete for the 2007 Pan American
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Under International Olympic Committee guidelines, the host
cities _ and their state or federal governments _ have to guarantee
the budget for putting on the two-week event. That means taxpayers
could be on the hook for any shortfall of private funds. It is
expected that the 2012 Olympics might cost as much as $3 billion to
produce.
</P>
<P>
   The funding guarantee is not yet crucial for Dallas and Houston.
The cities seeking the 2012 Olympics don't have to submit a formal
bid to the USOC until 2002. The USOC in 2003 will select a city
from among Dallas; Houston; Cincinnati; Los Angeles; New York;
Tampa, Fla.; and Washington, D.C.-Baltimore to compete against
international cities.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a hitch with Reyna's bill. The chairman of the
Dallas bid for the 2012 Olympics said he cannot support the bill
because of his bid committee's promise not to seek public financing
for the bid.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush and some legislators have said they're not
keen about statewide funding for regional sports events if it
involves increasing the 8.25 percent sales tax cap. Reyna's bill
does not mention the sales tax but asks in general terms for a
guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it was worded, it's not a piece of legislation we're
supporting,'' said Tom Luce, chairman of Dallas 2012, the city's
Olympic bid committee. ``It's more like an unlimited guarantee, and
we're not going to ask anybody for an unlimited guarantee.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Kim Brimer, R-Arlington, said legislators are unlikely to
approve statewide help for a regional sports event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything regional the state's not going to pay for,'' Brimer
said. ``They would be barking up the wrong tree.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of guarantees is controversial. Two Dallas city
councilwomen wanted the council to reconsider its support of the
Dallas bid after learning of the guarantees. But members of the bid
cities say that although the guarantees are required, corporate
sponsorships and fees for television rights should pay for the
Games.
</P>
<P>
   If a guarantee _ like the one that Utah lawmakers approved for
the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City _ is not forthcoming,
Blackwood said, there are other possibilities that might allow the
bid committee to obtain guarantees without leaving taxpayers
liable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be able to come up with some alternatives,''
she said. ``We are looking at agreements with vendors to share some
responsibility to make sure the games are successful. And maybe San
Antonio or the state can help us find some event insurance to cover
the shortfall, using their good faith and credit.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brimer said his legislation enacted in 1997 to help
communities and counties pay for sports facilities through a
variety of funding methods may provide the best vehicle for
financing the big-ticket items of the games: Olympic venues.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Brimer Bill'' is helping Dallas build a new downtown
sports arena, Round Rock construct a ballpark for Nolan Ryan's
minor-league baseball team and El Paso carry on its annual Sun Bowl
college football game.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the pitches we made when trying to pass the bill was
its regional concept,'' Brimer said. ``A group of five or six
counties or cities could go together and do a project. It would
allow a funding method they never had before.''
</P>
<P>
   Each county, or each city in a group of cities, would have to
conduct a separate election, but Brimer said such elections would
allow communities to gauge support for a project.
</P>
<P>
   The sports-facilities law allows voters to approve a sales tax
increase of up to a half-cent as long as it doesn't exceed the 8.25
percent cap, to increase taxes on car rentals and hotel and motel
rooms, and to add a fee to tickets and parking at the events.
</P>
<P>
   The ticket and parking fees may be most attractive to Dallas
interests because it would allow those attending the Games to help
pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas bid effort, in addition to operating costs, has
several big infrastructure needs. It would cost $250 million to put
a retractable roof on the Cotton Bowl and renovate the stadium for
track-and-field events and for opening and closing Olympic
ceremonies, according to preliminary estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The region also lacks an aquatics center and dormitory space for
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of bid committees in Dallas, Houston and San Antonio
have been meeting for several months to draft a common legislative
agenda, but the details haven't been worked out, Luce said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the cities agreed that the widening Olympic
bribery scandal that has tainted the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake
City probably won't affect the passage of any necessary legislation
because of the massive revisions expected for the bidding process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this as a really positive step,'' Blackwood said. ``We
were always going to play by the rules, and now we can assure
sponsors and even legislators that there is an even playing field
and the bid process will be highly scrutinized.''

NICKLAUS, NEW HIP IN PLACE, HEADS FOR FLORIDA RECUPERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They were steps taken with crutches and with far less
fanfare than his strolls up 18th fairways for parts of four
decades, but that didn't seem to bother Jack Nicklaus Monday. The
most accomplished golfer in history left New England Baptist
Hospital and headed home to North Palm Beach, Fla., for
recuperation following last Wednesday's surgery for total left hip
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   He may be years removed from his glory days as the Golden Bear,
but, at 59, Nicklaus still commands a huge presence. Thus, the
modest act of leaving a hospital meant a stage, not before a huge
gallery, but a press conference, with the national media plugged
in. The surgery, he said, was something he gave a great deal of
thought to, and it was not a decision made so that he could stalk
more glory. With 18 major professional championships, he has
cemented his place in sports history; he wants now to live
pain-free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf wasn't the reason I came here; the quality of life was
the reason I came here,'' said Nicklaus. ``There are no illusions,
not at 59 or 60, of competing with the Tiger Woodses and David
Duvals. But I'm looking forward to having this stabilize my hip and
allow me to function to a quality of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The recovery process will involve rest, some isometrics,
stretching, then a little walking, according to Dr. Benjamin
Bierbaum, who performed the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am tired,'' said Nicklaus. ``I am a guy with pretty endless
energy, but I don't have a lot right now. I usually go to the
office, but the office will have to come to me now.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for someone to ask about his plans for
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I would love to play golf again,'' said Nicklaus.
``There's no question about that. My goal is _ I don't think I will
make it _ is the Memorial Tournament (June 3-6). But my chances are
probably 1 in 50.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus emphasized that Bierbaum is calling the shots and said
he will return to Boston in five or six weeks for a checkup. A
conservative timetable calls for competition in six or seven
months, ``simply because I won't be able to play three, four, or
five days in a row,'' said Nicklaus. ``Four months from now, I'll
be able to play a round of golf and probably do just fine.'' But it
will take time to build up his stamina.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus will miss his first Masters (April 8-11) since his
debut in 1959 and most likely he won't be at Pinehurst June 17-20
for the US Open, an event he has missed just once (1960) since he
burst upon the scene in 1957 as a teen-ager out of Columbus, Ohio,
who hit the ball with jaw-dropping length. If the end to such
remarkable streaks is making Nicklaus melancholy, he hid it
masterfully.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if a burden had been lifted from his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been struggling with this since the PGA Championship at
Bellerive (in 1992),'' he said. ``My hip was bad enough that I
remember making a statement to Barbara (his wife) that I am tired
of playing on one leg.''
</P>
<P>
   To alleviate the pain, Nicklaus embarked on a vigorous exercise
program and for a while he was able to stay competitive, but last
summer it reached a critical point. After June's US Open marked his
record 146th straight start in a major, Nicklaus looked at the
British Open the following month and knew it was a futile cause.
The pain was brutal, the leg was going numb, and the truth was too
hard to run from.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going to go play, you've got to be prepared,'' he
said. ``And if you can't prepare, you can't compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus did not go over to Royal Birkdale, nor did he play in
the PGA Championship in August. He did play in the US Senior
Amateur in late July, but that was his final tournament of 1998.
There was a long stretch without golf, then in late December, after
returning from Australia, where he captained the US team in the
Presidents Cup, Nicklaus said he hit balls, starting with 30 the
first day.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the fifth day, I decided to play nine holes of golf and it
was a disaster,'' he said. ``That's when I said, `I need to make a
phone call.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It has been said that Nicklaus, despite encouragement from
family and friends, put surgery off for too long, but he said that
wasn't the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my timing was probably accurate,'' said Nicklaus. ``I
don't think I wasted a whole lot of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that on one good leg last April he made a dramatic run
at a seventh green jacket, only to finish fifth in the Masters,
Nicklaus flashed a little grin, as if he were about to go on a
back-nine charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to find out,'' he said. ``That would be a very
interesting thing, to find out if my legs are good and I don't
fatigue and I functionally can finish a golf swing. Having that
ability versus what I have right now, that could be a very big
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Nicklaus, seated in the audience, smiled at this sudden
burst of competitive spirit, one she has witnessed since those
campus days at Ohio State. She has a more modest goal for husband _
to dance at their youngest son Michael's wedding Feb. 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take two steps on crutches and that will be my dance,''
joked Nicklaus.

EXHIBIT DEPICTS A VISUAL CHESS MATCH BETWEEN THE TWO TITANS OF
MODERN ART
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by KIMBELL-EXHIBIT) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso were
introduced by Gertrude Stein in 1906. Previously, they were aware
of one another only by reputation. They've come together again in
an exhibit of more than 100 works that opened Sunday at the Kimbell
Art Museum in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of their first meeting, Matisse had established
himself as the leader of the fauves, the ``wild beasts,'' the
iconoclastic artists of the day. His determination to remain true
to his artistic vision _ he wasn't necessarily out to shock _
resulted in pictures whose garish colors and distortions of form
and space repelled even many of his peers.
</P>
<P>
   Picasso, 12 years younger, was the brash and brilliant young
newcomer to Paris' explosive art scene. Picasso was relentless in
his pursuit of notoriety, in his attempts to shock the bourgeoisie
and to become a true painter of modern life. By now, he had painted
his masklike portrait of Stein and was working with a geometric
vocabulary that presaged cubism.
</P>
<P>
   These are the stories of Matisse and Picasso that art lovers
know so well, the legends that were played out during the glory
years of European modern art _ such as the defection of Stein from
Matisse's camp to Picasso's and Picasso's response to Matisse's
``Joy of Life'' via his vicious ``Desmoiselles d'Avignon.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is another story _ one rich in its revelations about
human nature and artistic motivations, one of great art history
significance, one that offers tremendous insights into how so many
of the 20th century's truly important artworks came into being.
</P>
<P>
   This other story, telling of Matisse and Picasso's later years,
is recounted in the Kimbell's new, groundbreaking exhibition,
``Matisse and Picasso: A Gentle Rivalry.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is the first major presentation pairing the two artists
in 50 years. It was curated by one of the world's leading art
historians. Yve-Alain Bois, of Harvard University, is a thorough
and iconoclastic scholar who has conducted important new research
on the careers of both artists.
</P>
<P>
   What he has found is that the artistic competition that abruptly
ended when Matisse moved from Paris to Nice in late 1917 was only a
foreshadowing of the protracted rivalry (which Bois variously
describes as a ``tango'' and a ``chess game'') that ensued around
1930.
</P>
<P>
   Selecting artworks well-known and also rarely, if ever,
exhibited, Bois assembled about 50 paintings, sculptures and
graphic works by Matisse and slightly more than 50 by Picasso into
an art history chronology.
</P>
<P>
   In 1930, Matisse was emerging from his years in Nice. He was
racked by doubt and bereft of inspiration. Critics had labeled him
a has-been. He was unable to paint at all.
</P>
<P>
   Picasso, on the other hand, was riding a wave of critical and
commercial success. Indeed, he was intolerably in command of the
scene. If Matisse had been immobilized by criticism, Picasso was
suffering from a lack of critical challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Picasso looked back at Matisse's early achievements and he knew:
He needed Matisse back. And in top form.
</P>
<P>
   So he started teasing the old lion, mimicking his art. He seemed
to mock Matisse's obsession with odalisques (harem girls), leaping
dancers and views through windows. He dared Matisse to return to
the fray.
</P>
<P>
   And that is where this exhibition begins. ``Matisse and
Picasso'' shows visitors Picasso's long, looping looks back at
Matisse's work and his responses to Matisse's innovations. It puts,
right before our eyes, Matisse's immediate and deliberate responses
to Picasso's cubistic handling of space, his deployment of symbolic
shapes.
</P>
<P>
   It opens with an introductory group of potentially taunting
pictures by Picasso. From there, however, it quickly moves into
``Act One: A Fresh Start, 1930-32,'' in which we see Picasso
grappling with Matisse's tremendous gift for modeling sculpture.
Also, in response to a Matisse gallery retrospective in mid-1931,
we see his hastily produced series of ``sleeping beauties'' that
widely were recognized as a gesture toward Matisse.
</P>
<P>
   But, what of Matisse? How, if at all, would he respond?

AFTER TERRIFYING ACCIDENT, CLARK TO RUN IN MILLROSE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In 1978, as a 15-year-old high school sophomore from
Maplewood, N.J., Joetta Clark ran in the Millrose Games. Except for
1984, when she was injured, she has run in this invitation track
meet every year and has won the women's 800 meters six times.
</P>
<P>
   She is ranked fourth in the world and can run in almost any meet
she wants. Still, she said, Friday night's Chase Millrose Games in
Madison Square Garden ``is more special than any other.''
</P>
<P>
   At a Monday luncheon meeting of the New York Track Writers
Association, she told why, a harrowing tale of a crash last Sept.
15 involving her auto and an 18-wheel semi-trailer that left her
with a battered body and initial fears that she might not walk
again, let alone run.
</P>
<P>
   That day, she said, she drove to Newark Airport to pick up
airline tickets. On the way home, on the Elizabeth ramp to the New
Jersey Turnpike, she said the truck merged into her lane when there
was no room to merge. It hit her car on the driver's side.
</P>
<P>
   ``It spun the car around and jackknifed,'' she said. ``I was
pinned in the car. A 20-year-old guy from Colts Neck, N.J., named
Howard Marcus stopped and stayed with me while we were waiting for
an ambulance. He flagged down another guy, Gerry DeHaven from
Princeton, N.J., and he used my cell phone to call my mother and
father. Then he said, `Aren't you Joetta Clark?' I said yes. He
said, `Can I have an autograph?' I gave him an autograph.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark was finally pulled from her battered car. At the hospital,
she learned she had a concussion, two torn lumbar discs, a torn
abdominal muscle and an injured left eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of things wrong with me,'' she said. ``I was
bedridden for three weeks. I wasn't thinking about running
Millrose, just to be able to run again. You don't think you won't
run again. You just thank the Lord for being alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to move your arms and legs. I was in so much pain that
I wasn't thinking about running, just walking again and being my
vibrant self. I'm happy just to be able to raise my left arm over
my head and move my right leg 90 degrees.''
</P>
<P>
   That flexibility, such as it is, did not come easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``My body had been tossed around,'' she said. ``As an athlete,
my pain threshold is a lot higher than most people's. For me to sit
in bed all day was not something I liked to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The rehabilitation was intense: lifting her arms, moving her
legs, riding a stationary bike, stretching, massage, electrical
stimulation, running in a pool. Just before Thanksgiving, she
started running on a track. She is still getting therapy to
strengthen her arms and legs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 36, she is back for her 21st Millrose Games, a record
for this 92-year meet. She will run the 800 meters against Meredith
Rainey Valmon, Michelle DiMuro-Ave, Alisa Harvey and Zhang Jian of
China. She made it clear that she was running to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't run just to run,'' she said, ``not at this point in
my career. It would be embarrassing. Winning Millrose would
probably be the highlight of my career because this hasn't been a
typical year for me. The rehab has been tougher than training, but
I am a tough person. I am running with aggression.''

NEW EDITOR FOR DETAILS MAGAZINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a move that acknowledges the mighty selling power
of bosoms and beer, Conde Nast has appointed Mark Golin _ editor in
chief of Maxim magazine _ to be editor in chief of Details
magazine. After weeks of intense speculation in the magazine
industry, Michael Caruso, the current editor in chief of Details,
has stepped down.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced to the American market in 1997, Maxim, a
testosterone-rich, off-color bible of sports, sex and humor for
young men, has proved to be one of the most successful new
magazines of the decade. It has windsprinted in ad pages and
circulation past its competitors in the men's market, like Details,
Conde Nast's GQ, Wenner Media's Men's Journal, Hearst Corp.'s
Esquire and Gear, a title introduced last year by Bob Guccione Jr.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Details, GQ and Esquire all seemed to have mimicked
Maxim's standard cover: a gorgeous, seminude starlet and headlines
_ like ``The Triumph of Cleavage Culture'' on Esquire _ that
emphasize sex over substance.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from Maxim's success, American readers do not crave
substance. Maxim was introduced in England in 1995 by Felix Dennis,
the owner of Dennis Publishing. In 1997, Dennis bet that consumers
in this country were ready for an American version of the Maxim
sensibility, which stresses post-adolescent pleasures over grown-up
refinement.
</P>
<P>
   Maxim delivered; the circulation rate base guaranteed to
advertisers for the second half of 1999 is 950,000 readers in the
United States _ an increase of 111 percent over the corresponding
period last year. By comparison, the guaranteed rate base of
Details for the six months that ended in June 1998 was 475,000. For
the 10 issues of 1998, Maxim ran 630 ad pages, according to an
estimate by the Publishers Information Bureau. The current
January/February issue carries 62.5 ad pages, an increase of 75
percent from the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   A Conde Nast executive, who insisted on anonymity, said that
James Truman, the Conde Nast editorial director, became enamored
with Maxim last year. He saw Golin as a fix for Details, which
under Caruso went through several variations to attract readers,
emphasizing at various times features about sports, music, personal
grooming or men's fashions. Despite an inconsistent editorial
vision, ad pages grew under Caruso's watch, from 1,083 pages in
1997 to 1,125 in 1998; advertising revenue grew from $35 million in
1997 to $38 million in 1998, according to the publishers bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Conde Nast, part of Advance Publications, purchased Details in
1990, when it was an urban monthly with a distinctly downtown
Manhattan voice. Caruso arrived in May 1997, after two years as
editor in chief of Los Angeles magazine and a stint as a senior
articles editor at Vanity Fair. Caruso replaced Joe Dolce, an
editor who read about his dismissal in the pages of The New York
Observer.
</P>
<P>
   Golin, a former editor at Rodale Press in Emmaus, Pa. _ which
publishes Men's Health, among other titles _ moved to New York in
early 1997 to work as Bonnie Fuller's deputy at Cosmopolitan,
Hearst Corp.'s leading women's magazine. Ms. Fuller has since
become the editor in chief of Glamour, a Conde Nast magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Golin's move may seem like an odd fit for Conde Nast, a company
long known for its arbiters of cool insider elegance, like
Alexander Liberman, its one-time editorial director. But Golin _
the author of such coverlines as ``Touch Her Right Here: 10 Hot
Spots for One-Stroke Seduction,'' and ``Hollywood's Sexiest
Mommies'' _ said he would not feel out of place and that he was
pleased to work in the company of Ms. Fuller again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will try not to wear overalls and chew hay in the office,''
he said, adding: ``Michael turned out a good magazine, but
obviously I will make some changes. I would like to bring a bit of
my sense of humor to the thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The men's market will continue to grow toward the cheeky and
adolescent. Emap Petersen, the U.S. subsidiary of the British
publisher Emap PLC, plans to introduce FHM, the chief competitor
for Maxim's readers in the British market, by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Golin said he was not worried, that his principal interest was
his readers, and his readers' principal interest was women. ``I
think,'' he said, ``if you are going to have a general-interest
magazine for men, well _ surprise, surprise _ one of men's general
interests is women.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to comment on his salary, saying that would be ``so
gauche.''
</P>
<P>
   Caruso had only a brief comment on the transition. ``I had a
wonderful staff,'' he said, ``and I wish them the best of luck in
the future incarnation.''

 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. _ From his office in a suburban business park,
John Sponyoe, president of Lockheed Martin Global
Telecommunications, can gaze over to a nearby building that houses
his goal: Comsat Corp., the quasi-government satellite company that
Lockheed Martin Corp. wants to buy for $2.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   On a straight line, the Comsat building is just a few football
fields away. Without leaving his desk, Sponyoe (pronounced
SPAWN-yo) can get a clear view of the big COMSAT sign that stares
back at him every time he looks up. But for Sponyoe and for
Lockheed, Comsat is so near and yet so far away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the helicopter business before this,'' Sponyoe
said. ``And this deal has got more moving parts than a helicopter.
We know we are going to have a fight on our hands. But we think the
deal makes good business sense and is doable.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lockheed, the Comsat deal would leapfrog the company, the
United States' No. 2 military contractor behind Boeing, into the
major leagues of global telecommunications and provide it with
much-needed diversification away from the vagaries of the Pentagon
budget and policies.
</P>
<P>
   But to accomplish the Comsat deal, Lockheed needs approval of
the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission,
and even an act of Congress. In effect, it must win a Washington
trifecta.
</P>
<P>
   And lining up to make life miserable for Lockheed at every step
along the way is a formidable array of rival commercial satellite
companies, telecommunications giants, consumer groups and
unsympathetic members of Congress, all of whom have different
reasons for being hostile to Comsat and Lockheed. In the scorecard
for the new Congress, this showdown is expected to be one of the
biggest legislative battles affecting business this year _ for
reasons that go far beyond this deal.
</P>
<P>
   This is because Lockheed is walking into a larger
telecommunications-industry minefield as it tries to acquire
Comsat, the U.S. signatory and 19 percent owner of Intelsat, an
international satellite network created decades ago that Congress
now wants to privatize.
</P>
<P>
   To pull off the Comsat merger, Lockheed must delicately thread
its way through the larger issue of Intelsat deregulation. And how
Congress settles that issue could either scuttle the Comsat deal or
create terms so onerous that no corporation _ neither Lockheed nor
anyone else _ would want to buy the satellite company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lockheed wants to be a much bigger player in a much
faster-growing and more profitable business than their core defense
business,'' said Peter Aseritis, an industry analyst with CSFB
Securities. ``It's a technology they feel they understand. But to
buy Comsat, they have to go through all these complicated hurdles.
If they can get through all those wickets, they could move to be
one of the biggest players in global telecommunications.''
</P>
<P>
   That prospect is what is keeping Lockheed motivated, especially
after suffering a major setback in Washington last year when the
government halted the company's $8.3 billion bid for Northrop
Grumman Corp., a smaller military contractor. That 11th-hour
setback tarnished Lockheed's legendary reputation as a skilled
Washington insider and sent its strategic thinking in new
directions.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed already manufactures commercial satellites for others
and launches them. So acquiring a commercial satellite network to
operate _ charging others to bounce their signals off Lockheed's
satellites _ would be a logical business extension, Washington
willing.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed's telecommunications division has revenues of around
$350 million a year. Adding Comsat would bring those revenues to
around $1 billion. More important, the combination could put
Lockheed in the catbird seat to acquire even more of Intelsat's
global satellite network, the world's largest.
</P>
<P>
   Right now Lockheed, a company with $28 billion in 1997 sales,
could use some help. Lockheed angered shareholders _ some sued the
company while others dumped the stock _ after it announced just
before Christmas an unexpected shortfall in the company's
fourth-quarter earnings. Lockheed's stock fell 11 percent to around
$40 a share on that announcement, and it remains there.
</P>
<P>
   (On Jan. 28, Lockheed reported a 66 percent drop in
fourth-quarter earnings, largely because of a one-time write-off.
For 1998, earnings were 23 percent below the year earlier, and it
predicted 1999 earnings would be dismal, too.)
</P>
<P>
   ``If Lockheed wants to secure new growth areas, it's got to look
outside of pure defense,'' said Sponyoe, who heads Lockheed's newly
created telecommunications division. ``We're going forward on the
basis that we will close the Comsat deal. This isn't something we
did knee-jerk after Northrop. We want this deal to close, and we
are throwing all the assets of Lockheed behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Lockheed has assembled an all-star lobbying team.
Even its chief executive, Vance Coffman, has joined Sponyoe and
other Lockheed executives in making three pilgrimages to Capitol
Hill just in the past month.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Lockheed has hired some of Washington's heaviest
hitters. They include Podesta Associates (run by the brother of
John Podesta, the White House chief of staff); Verner Liipfert
Bernhard, McPherson &AMP; Hand (Bob Dole's law firm); and former
lawmakers, including former Rep. Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., a close
Clinton associate. Altogether, 11 lobbying firms have joined
Lockheed's in-house lobbying staff in pursuing the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Comsat has seven more lobbying firms at its disposal, and
Democratic fund-raisers, including Peter Knight, a top political
adviser to Vice President Al Gore, on its board.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed and Comsat need this firepower because a measure to
privatize Intelsat passed the House last year, 416-17, on terms
Lockheed considered so onerous that it said it would walk away from
the deal if the same bill was approved by Congress this year. The
bill died in the Senate in the last days of the 105th Congress. It
would also privatize Immarsat, a sister organization with four
satellites providing marine communications. Comsat owns 23 percent
of Immarsat.
</P>
<P>
   Comsat's foes say it has enjoyed a monopoly franchise on U.S.
access to Intelsat's 24 commercial satellites for too long, and
they want to strip Comsat of many of the privileges it enjoys _
most important, immunity from the antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed has expressed willingness to give up these privileges.
In a company statement now being circulated in Washington, it said
it wanted Intelsat privatized in a ``meaningful, pro-competitive
way _ soon.'' But opponents of the Lockheed-Comsat deal, mainly
other satellite companies, dismiss Lockheed's statement, saying in
a position paper that it ``offers only the appearance of reform.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   More to the point, the foes have an array of other proposals
that could undermine long-term contracts Comsat has already signed
and could allow customers to bypass Comsat entirely to get to
Intelsat _ measures that would sharply diminish the value of Comsat
to Lockheed.
</P>
<P>
   The Intelsat privatization bill would establish the future rules
of the game for global satellite communications in the same way
that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 set rules for the
ground-based industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Lockheed is hiring tells me they are deadly serious about
this deal,'' said Henry Goldberg, a lobbyist for Panamsat, a rival
leading the opposition. ``They have a belt-and-suspenders approach
and are hiring everyone they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Marlowe, president of his own lobbying firm and past
president of the American League of Lobbyists, concurred. ``This
issue is a lobbyists-full-employment act,'' he said. ``Every major
player is signed on on one side of this or another.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Panamsat, whose ultimate parent is General Motors, other
opponents of the takeover are Loral, Iridium, Boeing, Motorola,
Echostar, Teledesic and satellite users like AT&AMP;T, General
Electric, NBC, MCI Worldcom and Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, various ethnic groups _ Cubans, Armenians,
Latinos and Poles among them _ joined the anti-Comsat fray, seeking
lower international phone rates. Each group, besides having
formidable in-house lobbyists, has hired powerful outside lobbying
and public relations firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acquiring Comsat is a smart strategic move, but it is
tactically challenging,'' said Loren Thompson, a military industry
analyst at the Lexington Institute, an Arlington, Va. research
firm. ``In the long run, this is something Lockheed needs to do.
But the transaction is difficult to assess because of all the
political imponderables.''
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Lockheed must first push the deal over an
antitrust hurdle at the Justice Department. That should be the
easiest step, but regulators have asked Lockheed for more
information before deciding.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the Federal Communications Commission. Lockheed
needs to be declared a ``common carrier'' to increase its ownership
stake in Comsat from the 10 percent now permitted under law to 49
percent. Not surprisingly, all those against Lockheed in Congress
are submitting briefs to the FCC opposing this request.
</P>
<P>
   Among those opposing Lockheed before the FCC are Sen. Conrad
Burns, R-Mont., and Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va., chairmen of the two
congressional committees that will be passing on the Intelsat
deregulation bill. The satellite bill that overwhelmingly passed
the House last year _ and was opposed by Lockheed _ was sponsored
by Bliley.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts, however, say it appears that in the end, Lockheed
should prevail before the FCC. But to do so will take time and
legal talent. Right now the FCC is in the process of reviewing
comments, and a spokesman for the commission said it intended to
act soon but would not give a specific date.
</P>
<P>
   Then, to clear the final hurdle, Congress would have to lift a
statutory ownership cap so that Lockheed could increase its
ownership of Comsat to a full 100 percent. What worries Lockheed is
that Congress, in privatizing Intelsat, might set terms making
Comsat less valuable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you put a bill into Congress, all kinds of things can
come out,'' said Armand Musey, an analyst with C.E. Unterberg,
Towbin, a brokerage firm. ``Intelsat and Comsat have always been
underperformers, because they have never been able to move quickly.
If privatized, they will wake up. Comsat's competitors will want to
cripple it. So you are going to see a real food fight in
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed has made it clear that it wants 100 percent of Comsat,
not just a 49 percent stake. Lockheed would then be in a position
to expand its holdings in Intelsat over time, depending on the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Sponyoe is formulating the company's
preliminary message to Congress: While it is willing to forsake
many of the privileges Comsat now enjoys, it opposes a ``fresh
look'' at existing Comsat contracts. And it wants to have Intelsat
itself privatized in a way that keeps it largely intact so that it
is easier to acquire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people would just as soon not see us in the business or
want Intelsat to explode into many small parts,'' Sponyoe said.
``Our whole effort will be getting our message out and position
understood.''

 &HT;    Sure, the Falcons lost the Super Bowl; Still....
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Way back in August, long before the ''Dirty Bird'' was
born, there was certainly no way of knowing what lay ahead for the
Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   They appeared to be just another one of 15 or so teams in the
middle of the NFL pack. The long-beleagured squad with multiple
personnel holes looked as if might, with a few breaks, improve on
its 7-9 record from 1997 and perhaps make the playoffs for the
sixth time in 33 years.
</P>
<P>
   That limited optimism was enough to cause kicker Morten Andersen
to grouse a couple days after a loss to the Tennessee Oilers in the
preseason opener. He didn't like a headline in the
Journal-Constitution that referred to the game as ''ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What's up with that?'' he said. ''We lost, but it wasn't ugly.
Preseason games are like that, man. It seems like people have a
preconceived notion of this franchise, and they have to get words
like 'ugly,' or 'disaster,' or 'horrible' in there all the time.
It's a new year. How about a clean slate?''
</P>
<P>
   After the city of Atlanta threw a parade for the Falcons Monday,
it was obvious they had taken a clean slate and written a new
script: This team is no longer a bunch of has-beens, and wannabes.
They are defending NFC Champions, and with just two starters out of
22 whose contracts expire, they're will go into next season in
position with the goal not of making the playoffs but of returning
to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons made it to their first Super Bow. They lost 34-19 to
the Denver Broncos, but it was easily the best season of pro
football since the Falcons landed in Atlanta in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reeves joined Bud Grant, Marv Levy and Don Shula as the only
coaches to lose four Super Bowls as a head coach, but along the way
he gained a new appreciation for life after undergoing quadruple
heart-bypass surgery Dec. 14.
</P>
<P>
   He also developed a warm spot in his heart for a team that won a
franchise-record 11 games in a row and went 16-3 before the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ''They all hurt. That's the difficulty of playing in the Super
Bowl,'' said Reeves, who lost three Super Bowls in the 1980s while
head coach of the Broncos. ''Only one team in the whole league ends
up happy when the season is over.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we accomplished was a lot, and I don't think this
football team is satisfied with just being here. We worked hard.
They had a reat work ethic, great character, never quit . . .
they're extremely close. It's as good a group as I've ever been
around. It may not be the most talented football team, but they
sure play as well as they can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves and his staff, which stayed intact from last season to
this, didn't overhaul the team last training camp, as wide receiver
Tony Martin, rookie right tackle Ephraim Salaam, defensive tackle
Shane Dronett and free safety Eugene Robiinson were the only new
starters among 22.
</P>
<P>
   But a team that won six of its last eight in 1997 after starting
1-7 picked up from there this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons had never won at Carolina, but survived a
last-minute Hail Mary pass that slipped off the fingertips of
Panthers receiver Raghib Ismail to win 19-14 in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a hostile environment, seeing how the guys responded, we
knew we had a good team then,'' reserve cornerback and nickel back
Randy Fuller said. ''To say we thought we would get all the way to
the Super Bowl wouldn't be right, but you could see a total team
effort. Some other teams have individuals that have to . . . be in
the limelight, but this team . . . worked together.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta fell to 2-1 with a 31-20 loss at San Francisco Sept. 27,
but after outscoring the 49ers 13-0 in the second half, Reeves said
he learned his team would not give up.
</P>
<P>
   A 51-23 win over Carolina, and a 34-20 win on the road over the
Giants on ESPN in prime time served notice to the rest of the NFL
that the Falcons were a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal Anderson rushed for more than 100 yards in each of those
games on his way to franchise records of 1,846 rushing yards and 12
100-yard games and an NFL-record 410 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with quarterback Chris Chandler, who finished No. 4 in
the NFL with a 100.9 passer rating, Atlanta's offense grew more
dangerous weekly. He was hurt in the next game, though, and when he
missed an Oct. 25 road game against the Jets, the Falcons got
thrashed, 28-3. It was the last time they would lose for more than
three months. When the Falcons went to New England and laid waste
to the Patriots 41-10 on Nov. 8, Anderson and Santiago breathed
life into the ''Dirty Bird'' dance.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago, a second-year tight end, had heard a fan calling him
and his teammates ``the dirty birds,'' and he spread the word in
the locker room. Anderson, of course, ran with it. He incorporated
parts of a salute he and his teammates at the University of Utah
used to do to come up with a gig that the city has come to love.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago, though, was the first to perform it in a game. He
scored two touchdowns that day, and each time he started hopping up
and down on alternate feet while flapping imaginary wings and
squawking at the crowd. On defense, coverage got much better later
in the year, even though cornerback Ronnie Bradford missed six
starts, and was replaced by second-year man Michael Booker.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Eugene Robinson, who started the season very poorly after
signing as a free agent from Green Bay, improved in October.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the season, he was one of six Pro Bowlers on the
team, joining Anderson, Chandler, cornerback Ray Buchanan, middle
linebacker Jessie Tuggle and left tackle Bob Whitfield.
</P>
<P>
   Against the 49ers on Nov. 15, Buchanan had one of his seven
interceptions and returned the ball to the 1 to set up an Anderson
TD. Tuggle also recovered a Steve Young fumble for a touchdown, and
a team that led the NFL with a plus-14 turnover ratio was on a
roll, leading 24-6 as the Georgia Dome went nuts.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers came back with two quick touchdowns in the fourth
quarter, however, and with first place in the NFC West on the line,
the Falcons were tested. They could have decided to try to run the
clock out, but Chandler hit Mathis down the left sideline for a
78-yard touchdown with 2:51 left.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta was in first place in the division the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think people still questioned us until we beat them at
home,'' Reeves said. ''By winning the New England game, and beating
the 49ers, that gave us a tremendous amount of confidence.'' After
a 27-17 win at New Orleans on Dec.13, however, Reeves shook
everyone. After explaining to Harrison that he had experienced many
of the same symptoms that signaled heart problems almost a decade
earlier when he was coach of the Broncos, he underwent tests the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   He had quadruple bypass surgery that afternoon. Harrison said if
Reeves had waited much longer, the result could have been
''catastrophic.''
</P>
<P>
   The next Sunday, without their coach the Falcons had to go to
Detroit, where they had lost five in a row. But with defensive
coordinator Rich Brooks serving as interim head coach, the Falcons
won 24-17, sewing up the NFC West for just the second time. The
first came in 1980. In the final regular-season game, the Falcons,
with nothing to gain for the playoffs, followed Reeves' orders,
played like a team with nothing to lose and whipped the Dolphins
38-16. After a bye week, the Falcons played host to San Francisco
in their first home playoff game in 18 years, and Reeves returned
to the sideline. It looked at one time like it might be a blowout
as Anderson ran for two touchdowns to stake the Falcons to a 14-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Atlanta got conservative in the second half, and had to
intercept three Young passes to seal it. Robinson's 77-yard return
set up Andersen's game-winning field goal, and strong safety
William White finished the game with his second interception of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   That victory sent the Falcons to Minnesota, where the Vikings
(16-1) had blown away teams by an average of 26 points.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by more noise than one could imagine, the Falcons
fell behind 20-7 just before halftime. But Smith forced a Randall
Cunningham fumble, and Chandler hit Mathis for a 14-yard touchdown
pass with less than a minute in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Vikings led 27-20 with a couple of minutes left in
regulation when Minnesota kicker Gary Anderson lined up for a
38-yarder that would all but put the game out of reach. Anderson
had not missed a field goal all season. This one, though, he could
not make, sending it just wide to the left.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler drove the Falcons downfield, hitting Mathis with the
tying score from 16 yards out with 49 seconds left in regulation.
In overtime, the teams traded drives a couple times, and then
Chandler led the Falcons on a 10-play, 70-yard drive. This time,
Morten Andersen, kicking from 38 yards at the same goal where
Anderson missed, sent the ball down the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The Metrodome instantly transformed from thunderous to mute _
except for screaming Falcons. Two weeks later the dream ended in
Miami. Atlanta scored a Super Bowl field goal on its opening drive,
but Denver countered with a touchdown, and never looked back on the
way to a 34-19 repeat victory. ''It was just like the magic stopped
somewhere out there,'' Buchanan said. ``It was gone.'' All season,
intensity had been the team's strength. The 49ers' Young said it
after both games in which the Falcons beat San Francisco. ''They
compete on every play,'' he said. ''They just don't take any plays
off.'' ``What we accomplished was a lot, and I don't think this
football team is happy to just be here,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Super Bowl XXXIV is in the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as I've been here,'' said Tuggle, a 12-year Falcon,
``we reach the playoffs one year, and the next year was a disaster.
I'm hoping those years are behind us. We can learn from this; we
know what it takes to get here.''

FORT WORTH, Texas: would he respond? 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Act Two: Making Partners, 1932-39'' answers those questions by
presenting works from two projects that permitted Matisse to
recover his artistic strengths. He was commissioned by Albert C.
Barnes to create a mural for his gallery/house in Merion, Pa. _
which reconnected Matisse with his powerful motifs of pagan
dancers. And he was asked to illustrate Stephane Mallarme's
``Poesies,'' in which he recapitulated his ``sleeping beauties.''
</P>
<P>
   During these years, too, each artist explored and tried to
translate into his own work that visual language of the other _ as
seen in Picasso's drawings of dancers from 1933 and Matisse's
painting of ``La Verdure (Nymph in the Forest),'' which was begun
in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   Then came World War II. Many artists fled Europe _ an
immigration that led to New York's historic emergence as the center
of the art world _ while others reinvented themselves to suit
fascistic morals. Picasso and Matisse, however, remained in France
and continued their progressive, highly individualistic work.
</P>
<P>
   But Picasso was in Paris, forbidden to exhibit, and Matisse in
the south of France. Thus, their artistic exchange took the form of
works that friends transported to and fro, and memories of the
other's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Act Three: Parallel Play, 1940-44'' thus features Matisse's
``The Dream'' (1940), which reclaims the territory Picasso had
challenged with his ``Woman With Yellow Hair'' (1931). We see, as
well, Picasso painting variations on a favorite Matissean theme, a
seated woman wearing a hat.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, both artists were celebrated as national heroes.
At last, too, they lived near one another in the south of France
and could keep up with each other's work. When bad health forced
Matisse into bed, Picasso brought him recent works in order to
obtain Matisse's feedback.
</P>
<P>
   During this period _ covered in ``Act Four: Reunion, 1944-45'' _
the 80-year-old Matisse visits Picasso's 1946 show in Antibes and
makes pencil copies of several, as if he were again a young student
visiting the Louvre.
</P>
<P>
   Picasso, in the meantime, returns to Matisse's 1906 masterwork,
``The Joy of Life.'' This time, instead of demonizing it, Picasso
seems to revel in the work's celebration of life.
</P>
<P>
   During this period, too, Matisse executes a commission to
decorate a chapel in Vence[ cq] and Picasso, never one to be
outdone, undertakes his own Temple of Peace in Vallauris.
</P>
<P>
   Upon Matisse's death in 1954, Picasso was plunged into mourning.
But more than ever, he reincarnated Matisse through works that
directly addressed Matissean themes or incorporated his techniques
and formal innovations. Now that Matisse was gone, Bois says, it
seemed as though Picasso could be completely open in his admiration
for his old rival.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the story ends, with Picasso once again evoking Matisse.
This time, though, there was no luring him back, and so Picasso
continued _ peerless _ until his death in 1973.

BUSH DUSTS OFF, CASHES IN ON OLD POLITICAL SLOGAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ One potential rival calls the phrase ``silly and
insulting.'' Another says Gov. George W. Bush's trademark slogan
amounts to ``weasel words.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, the latest incarnation of ``compassionate
conservatism'' has caught fire, at least in Florida and Texas,
where practitioners Jeb and George W. Bush found success in an
otherwise bad election year for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Since the election, the slogan has become a cause celebre,
condemned by some as the GOP's bane, praised by others as its
salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it will play well in the 2000 presidential race is
unclear. Compassionate conservatism can be elusive, perhaps more
easily defined by what it is not rather than what it is.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the kind of divisive politics other Republicans have
used to ``bash'' Hispanics and vilify immigrants, says a
spokeswoman for the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic
advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does it rely on ``code words ... that turn black people
off,'' says black political analyst Sanders Anderson of Texas
Southern University.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Bush's stand against affirmative action,
while wrapped in careful language, does not sound very
compassionate to some minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he is compassionate, why is he against affirmative
action?'' asked Roberto Alonzo, a former state representative and
president of the Mexican American Democrats. ``It's not just about
compassion, it's about what Bush has done for Hispanics.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, while many gays were thrilled when Bush rebuked a
comment by a Republican party official comparing homosexuals to
pedophiles during the GOP state convention last year, they are
cautious of his policy on gays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hopeful,'' said Rep. Glen Maxey, D-Austin, the only openly
gay member of the Texas Legislature. ``I applauded what he said at
the Republican convention, but when it comes to real policy issues,
we don't have a clue.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush won't commit one way or another on a bill that would ban
adoptions by homosexual couples. But he said he supports the notion
that adoptions are better left to a man and a woman _ not two men
or two women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the first thing we ought to do with any placement of
children, we ought to be looking for heterosexual couples,'' Bush
said. ``To have a male and a female in a household, I think it
provides the proper role models to children's futures.''
</P>
<P>
   On affirmative action, Bush says a fairer policy is
``affirmative access,'' such as ensuring that students in the top
10 percent of their class are admitted by colleges, or actively
recruiting minorities to apply for appointive jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Affirmative action is quotas, where there is a group of people
sitting around saying, `All right, there is 11 percent of the
population that is so and so, therefore 11 percent of our
appointments must be this whether they are qualified or not,' ''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The best strategy is making sure ``our applicant pool reflects
Texas. Let's make sure we recruit and actively go out and seek
people and find people, and I think that's a different mentality,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bush has received accolades for appointing blacks and
Hispanics to key positions. He appointed, for example, the first
black railroad commissioner, Michael Williams of Arlington, and the
first Hispanic insurance commissioner, Jose Montemayor.
</P>
<P>
   After the Williams appointment, Sen. Rodney Ellis, an
African-American Democrat from Houston, applauded Bush for his
efforts to ``make Texas' government more reflective of its
population.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the historic appointments, however, figures from Bush's
office indicate that his appointments since taking office in 1995
have been 78 percent Anglo and 64 percent male.
</P>
<P>
   Of 2,273 total appointments, 184, or 8 percent, are black; 275,
or 12 percent, are Hispanic; and 817, or 36 percent, are women. By
comparison, two-thirds of the appointments made by his predecessor,
Ann Richards, were Anglo, 18 percent were Hispanic and 13 percent
were black. But simply counting appointees might be overlooking the
broader implications of Bush's political strategy. Anderson, the
TSU political scientist, said its success derives not from policy
but rather from language and symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not always what they say, it's how they say it,'' said
Anderson, citing Bush's appearance at a Martin Luther King Jr.
rally in Houston this month as an example of his successful
outreach efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What George W. Bush has done that other Republicans have not
done, is he has embraced certain symbols that are benign. It
wouldn't hurt other Republicans to embrace Martin Luther King,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   In a presidential bid, of course, Bush would first have to win a
primary contest with fellow Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The trick there is not necessarily appealing to minorities and
independents, who might be attracted to an unorthodox Republican
message, but rather to the GOP base, which is much more
conservative and potentially more hard-edged, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   It is here that Bush has become the target of often bitter
attacks from potential rivals, including former Vice President Dan
Quayle, who has instructed his staff never to use Bush's ``silly
and insulting'' slogan, and Lamar Alexander, who has tagged
compassionate conservatism as ``weasel words.''
</P>
<P>
   But many conservative Republicans who are not in the heat of a
presidential contest say Bush's message helps the GOP by couching
its conservative philosophy in ways that are palatable to the
American public.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Kent Grusendorf, R-Arlington, and Rep. Arlene Wohlgemuth,
R-Burleson, are both staunch conservatives and both like what they
see in Bush's compassionate conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lost much of the public perception debate,'' said
Wohlgemuth. ``There's more to it than just the greedy, selfish kind
of Republicans that we are stereotyped as being.''
</P>
<P>
   She said, for example, that overhauling welfare is a
compassionate way of teaching the poor how to make it on their own
instead of simply ``mailing out a check.''
</P>
<P>
   Tax cuts, a key item in Bush's legislative agenda for the past
two years, are another element of compassionate conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tax cuts are compassionate,'' Bush said. ``Tax cuts give
people more money.'' He also noted that his proposed budget
demonstrated compassion by increasing funding for the agency that
investigates child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who won re-election in November with 69 percent of the
vote _ a margin that included unusually high numbers of blacks and
Hispanics for a Republican _ is not the first politician to use the
phrase ``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the phrase has been used by at least one Republican now
seen as the antithesis of the slogan. Pete Wilson, a moderate on
some social issues but a hard-liner on immigration, used it with
great success in his 1988 race for California governor.
</P>
<P>
   It has also been employed by staunch conservatives such as talk
show host and presidential candidate Pat Buchanan. Former housing
secretary Jack Kemp, the 1996 GOP vice presidential nominee, also
used the term.
</P>
<P>
   While the term has been associated with figures as politically
ancient as Thomas Dewey, the former New York governor and two-time
presidential candidate, ``compassionate conservatism'' as a slogan
appears to be a Democratic invention.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest reference to the phrase located in a computer
search of major newspapers comes in connection with a drive by
former U.S. Rep. James R. Jones, D-Oklahoma, to steer the
Democratic party to the political center.
</P>
<P>
   After the party's dismal performance amid Ronald Reagan's
landslide 1984 re-election victory, Jones suggested that Democrats
use the slogan to show that being fiscally conservative and
socially moderate can go hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase never came into widespread use by Democrats, but the
notion stuck, and it became the basis of the Democratic Leadership
Council, which a young governor named Bill Clinton came to chair
and which helped forge the term ``New Democrat'' that the future
president would use over and over.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, now a New York businessman, said Republicans like Bush
are simply using the same strategy. If Democrats can be ``tough
liberals,'' then conservatives can be compassionate, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party now has the same public image on the
right-wing side of the political spectrum as the Democratic Party
had on the left wing side,'' Jones said. ``This is their way of
trying to have a code saying we want to bring the Republican Party
back to the center.''
</P>
<P>
   It works for James Dixon, an African-American preacher in
Houston who attended Bush's appearance at the Martin Luther King
Jr. celebration. Despite reports that Bush's reception there was at
times chilly, Dixon said the governor is making inroads.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is more middle-of-the-road than previous Republicans have
been,'' Dixon said. ``He is closer to what Bill Clinton is like, to
be honest with you.''

NEWS ANALYSIS: MILOSEVIC'S ADVANTAGE: IN TALKING PEACE, HE CAN WIN
BIG 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ As the deadline approaches for entering
peace talks on Kosovo province, with threats of NATO bombs and
sharp warnings from the West, Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav
president, has much to gain.
</P>
<P>
   The threats by the Clinton administration and its NATO allies to
bomb him into ceding effective control over the separatist province
not only make it easier for Milosevic to justify eventual
concessions but also make him indispensable to any settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as officials in Washington publicly revile Milosevic
and call him the main problem in the Balkans, he is also the
solution,'' a senior Western diplomat said. ``The West needs
Milosevic to settle Kosovo, and Milosevic needs the pressure of the
West to be able to do it. All the rest is hypocrisy.''
</P>
<P>
   Given Kosovo's mythic importance as the birthplace of the
Serbian nation, Serbian officials and senior diplomats here say,
Milosevic is bound to take NATO to the brink before agreeing to any
political settlement over Kosovo, where an ethnic Albanian majority
is fighting for independence.
</P>
<P>
   While the stick of NATO's bombs is a necessary condition for any
deal, Milosevic will also require some ``cake,'' as the new deputy
prime minister, Vuk Draskovic, put it _ a partial lifting of the
harsh diplomatic and economic isolation that the West imposed on
Serbia during the Bosnian war. Milosevic may also seek a quiet
promise that he not be indicted for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   There is a wide assumption here, based on the tone of the state
press, that Milosevic will send a delegation to the
Western-sponsored talks that are scheduled to start on Saturday
outside Paris. There has been no official announcement, however.
</P>
<P>
   And there is also a wide expectation that Milosevic will
eventually authorize an interim settlement that leaves Kosovo a
vague but largely self-governing entity within the formal
sovereignty of Yugoslavia, as the West is demanding.
</P>
<P>
   As he was in Bosnia, Milosevic would again become a vital
guarantor of any settlement, reinforcing his international and
domestic stature.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic will be able to argue that even the introduction of
Western troops into Kosovo will serve to repress the ``terrorism''
of the Kosovo Liberation Army, to protect Serbs and their holy
places and to keep Kosovo from becoming independent.
</P>
<P>
   Already, on state television, Milosevic is being hailed for
demanding that Kosovo must remain ``part of our country.'' While
the name of that country _ Yugoslavia or Serbia _ is left
deliberately vague, ``one can already smell the way a settlement
will be spun here,'' said Bratislav Grubacic, a well-connected
editor.
</P>
<P>
   The analytical cliche about Milosevic is that he survives by
creating crises that require national unity and justify the
stifling of dissent, and that he is a superb political tactician
who does not have a larger strategic vision. But he is also
considered a highly rational judge of his own interests, with
little emotional attachment to the kind of Serbian nationalism he
has manipulated for the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't care himself about Kosovo,'' said Aleksa Djilas, a
political scientist here who has written some of the best analyses
of Milosevic. ``His enemies are his best friends,'' said Djilas.
``He thrives when Serbs feel the world is being biased and unfair
to them. At the same time, the West comes to his aid when it treats
him respectfully, as someone who has all the cards in his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposition has helped Milosevic, too, Djilas said. ``There
was a chance for the opposition to unite and put Milosevic and the
Socialists out of power,'' he said. ``But they never did, and now
they're joining him.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, Milosevic fired key members of his inner circle,
including the long-serving army chief of staff, Gen. Momcilo
Perisic, and the director of intelligence, Jovica Stanisic,
reportedly at the urging of his wife, Mirjana Markovic, whom many
here compare to a socialist Lady Macbeth.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Washington officials saw the purge as an indication
of Milosevic's weakness and the fragility of his regime. Some
thought the effective loss of Kosovo would mean the quick downfall
of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But Perisic has not attracted supporters and Milosevic's control
over the apparatus of both the federal and Serbian authorities
seems enhanced, said both Grubacic and Ljiljana Smajlovic, a
Serbian journalist.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Smajlovic said, ``Milosevic is in great shape,'' having
co-opted into the governing coalition both the nationalist leader
of the Radical Party, Vojislav Sesejl, and the most charismatic
leader of the former opposition coalition, Draskovic, who agreed to
enter the federal government two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic can say with some legitimacy that he has a national
unity government, and politically, he controls every institution,''
Ms. Smajlovic said. ``The only people outside his reach are those,
like students, journalists and professors, who have no
parliamentary seats or institutional authority.''
</P>
<P>
   And this more liberal group can hardly attack Milosevic from the
right, for avoiding another war and making concessions on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officials here like to say that they don't have enough money
to make everyone happy, but they have enough to bribe anyone they
need,'' Grubacic said. ``The country is poorer than before, but
passive. Milosevic is the king, untouchable, and underneath him,
the factions are fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a prominent member of the opposition Democratic Party, its
vice president, Slobodan Vuksanovic, says Milosevic's position is
unchallenged now, and that the opposition has damaged itself badly
by its own mistakes and rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   Only two years ago, 200,000 people turned out daily in Belgrade
to demonstrate against Milosevic and in favor of democratic
spokesmen like Draskovic, Zoran Djindjic and Vesna Pesic. Their
coalition _ Zajedno, or unity _won local elections in Belgrade,
which represents almost a third of Serbia's population.
</P>
<P>
   But their own disputes destroyed the coalition, and their
decision to boycott parliamentary elections left them without any
parliamentary votes or a clear program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic didn't do this to us,'' Vuksanovic said. ``We did
this to ourselves. He's still in power because opposition leaders
missed so many opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposition could have won up to 100 of the 250 seats in the
Serb parliament, Vuksanovic said. ``In the end we're left with
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   While Draskovic contended in an interview that he has kept his
integrity and is fighting for the same democratic goals ``from
within,'' Vuksanovic believes that Draskovic is trying to benefit
from the perks of power, including wide access to the
state-controlled media.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he notes, Draskovic's deal with Milosevic will
deeply disappoint ordinary voters. ``They will look at this
opposition leader and say, `He's just like all the rest of them.'
`'
</P>
<P>
   The ordinary voter is afraid of risk, Vuksanovic said. ``They
know Milosevic is a bad guy, but they see that he's stronger than
all the other political leaders put together.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course the end will come for Milosevic, Grubacic said, but
not now. ``The challenge will be spontaneous, caused by a stupid
mistake, like the last drop of water that overfills the glass.''

HOW THE KIMBELL ART MUSEUM LANDED THE MATISSE-PICASSO SHOW
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies ART-MATISSE-PICASSO) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso are widely
considered the twin pillars of European modern art.
</P>
<P>
   So you'd think ``Matisse and Picasso: A Gentle Rivalry'' would
have a number of precedents. But no. It is the first major curated
exhibition of their works ever.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring 104 works, it reveals the intensive artistic exchange
between these two giants, from the late 1920s to the time of
Matisse's death and even after, in Picasso paintings that evoke the
memory of his late peer. The paintings, sculpture and graphic works
on view come from private and public collections in Australia,
France, Germany, Russia, Switzerland and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the exhibit nearly didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   It started off on a promising note: In the process of
identifying his scholarly focus, exhibition guest curator Yve-Alain
Bois realized that about half of the loans he would want would be
readily available. But then Bois and former Kimbell curator Joachim
Pissarro _ who'd initially conceived the exhibition _ discovered
that they weren't the only ones planning to pair the two giants.
</P>
<P>
   The Tate Gallery, the Museum of Modern Art in New York and two
Paris museums had scheduled a Matisse-Picasso survey for 2002.
Would the shows overlap? Eventually, Bois and Pissarro confirmed
that their show could stand on its own.
</P>
<P>
   As to that future Matisse-Picasso pairing, well, the folks at
MoMA are rather mum. Still, MoMA curators John Elderfield and Kirk
Varnedoe told London's Art Newspaper in December: ``Giants such as
this exhibition are born in the upper ranks of the museum, not
least because they involve international museum relations. The idea
started with the British art historian John Golding, who did a
marvelous Picasso and sculpture show recently at the Tate.''
</P>
<P>
   Golding, in a recent phone interview, was a bit more helpful.
``I think the two shows will complement each other and help each
other,'' he said. ``Exhibitions can feature similar or some of the
same materials, but do so in very different ways that set them
apart. Like the Kimbell show, ours will mix masterpieces and
lesser-known works. But ours is wider in scope ... and it relies
more on curators' instinctual comparisons and contrasts between the
works than the art-historical approach Yve-Alain has taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Matisse-Picasso exhibitions of the past can't hold a candle to
either of these efforts. There have been only two of consequence,
and both reflected little curatorial vision.
</P>
<P>
   One, in 1938, was a small selection of graphic works by both
artists at the Museum of Modern Art, Boston, which no longer
exists.
</P>
<P>
   The other debuted on Dec. 5, 1945, and continued through Jan.
15, 1946, at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. At that
time, just after World War II, the museum's collection was still
hidden for safekeeping in the slate mines in Wales. To celebrate
peace and to cover its empty walls, the museum borrowed 30 works
from Matisse and 25 pieces from Picasso.
</P>
<P>
   There was no curatorial premise. Matisse presented a
miniretrospective, with quite a few early works; Picasso showcased
recent images from the war years. Indeed, some sources refer to the
presentation as two simultaneous one-person shows.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Matisse did not welcome the London exhibition with
open arms. As he wrote in his journal on Aug. 3, 1945: ``I'm doing
this propaganda show in London with him. I can imagine the room
with my pictures on one side, and his on the other. It's as if I
were going to co-habit with an epileptic. How quiet I will look.
... ''
</P>
<P>
   Critics gave both artists equal shares of attention, but the
general public clamor focused on Picasso, and it was his work that
packed the galleries with enraged viewers.

 &HT;    Robinson: 'I hope it wasn't harmful to team'
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ For Falcons fans, Monday was devoted to such questions
as ``What if?'' and ``What comes next?'' and ``Why?'' However, it
was one particular player, not the entire Atlanta Falcons team,
undergoing the usual Super Bowl post-mortem here.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after Eugene Robinson was charged with soliciting oral
sex from an undercover police officer, and one day after the
Falcons got squashed in the Super Bowl, questions swirled about the
veteran starting safety.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, 35, will have to return to Miami for a
to-be-determined court date, but only if he wants to contest the
charge. The misdemeanor solicitation charge carries a maximum
sentence of 60 days in jail, but most first-time offenders are
offered some combination of community service, which might be
performed elsewhere, a course on the dangers of solicitation, and a
fine, according to Miami police.
</P>
<P>
   After Robinson was arrested Saturday night, initial accounts
said he would have to face the charge in person, probably within 30
days. But a court spokesman said Monday that it could take even
longer for the misdemeanor charge to work its way through the
crowded docket, and that Robinson has other options than to appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have to be here,'' said Morton Luckoff,
media-relations director for the 11th Judicial Circuit, which
covers Miami-Dade County. ``His lawyer could just enter a plea on
his behalf . . . if he's not going to fight it.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear what Robinson would do. Emerging from the team
plane in Atlanta Monday with his arm around his wife, Gia, Robinson
proclaimed his innocence. But he said that, on his lawyer's advice,
he could not elaborate. The comment was somewhat less dramatic than
his declaration after the game Sunday that he would be ``found
innocent of this deal, but not righteous by the standards I set for
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Those standards were impressive enough to earn Robinson a
prestigious award from Athletes In Action, an Ohio-based Christian
sports ministry. Now in its 11th year, the Bart Starr Award winner
is decided by a vote of NFL players and is presented during Super
Bowl Week. It is intended to honor a player for ``leadership in the
home, on the field and in the community,'' a group spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson received the award in Miami on Saturday, hours before
his arrest. On Monday, Athletes In Action was negotiating through a
turn of events unprecedented in its 33-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next few days, we'll sort out where we are and what's
going to happen next,'' said Dave Bratton, pro staff liaison for
the organization. ``We're not even near talking about anything like
asking for it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respect the impact that Eugene has had on the teams he's
played on over the years,'' Bratton said, adding that the
organization was praying for Robinson, who also played in Seattle
and Green Bay, and his family. ``I loved Dan Reeves' words, when he
said that `We love him unconditionally.''' Most of the Falcons
insisted that the incident had not affected their play in the Super
Bowl, although Robinson didn't sound convinced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it was a distraction to my teammates,'' he
said upon arriving in Atlanta. ``I hope it wasn't. The organization
has been tremendous to me _ the fans, my teammates, everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Some fans, however, felt let down by Robinson's mistake on the
eve of the single biggest game in the 33-year history of the
Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   At the team's welcome-home parade in downtown Atlanta, spectator
Alex Solodkin, a Georgia Tech student, watched Robinson go by on a
fire truck. ``Imagine, right before the Super Bowl,'' Solodkin said
. ``You'd think he'd have better sense than that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Callers are angry at him for disappointing his teammates,''
said Chris Dimino, co-host of Atlanta sports talk station WQXI's
``The Bottom Line'' show. ''They're not getting into the moral
aspect of it so much as what he did as a football player.''

<P>
   There's an old joke about a child who is pleased to find his
bedroom filled with horse manure. As the grinning youngster wades
in with a shovel, he chortles, ``There must be a pony in here
somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was only appropriate that a commercial during Super Bowl
XXXIII on Sunday featured a pony, as the prize inside an imaginary
``really big bag'' of Cracker Jack. That's because the spot was one
of a handful of gems buried deep within a morass of sludge.
</P>
<P>
   The joke's scatological image is also appropriate because many
of the 51 paid commercials that ran nationally during the game _ 48
shown one time each, plus 3 repeats _ were replete with bathroom
humor, along with other crude, common, cornball imagery. Perhaps
that's why Super Sunday turned out to be even more of a misnomer
than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a coincidence that this tasteless celebration of the
juvenile and puerile came during the first Super Bowl after the
success of the gross-out comedy ``There's Something About Mary''?
It seemed that advertisers and agencies assumed most of the 127.5
million-plus viewers of the game were either ardent fans of that
film or fraternity pledges, or both, given the number of
commercials dominated by sophomoric slapstick, toilet talk and
gratuitous sex and violence. No wonder two commercials used the
dude anthems ``Bad Boys'' and ``Bad to the Bone'' on the
soundtracks.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that also accounted for all the stereotyped presentations
of women. Virtually every female face seen in a commercial belonged
to either a scantily clad sexpot, a demure mother or a dowdy
great-aunt. Except for a minority of advertisers like the AT&AMP;T
Corp., spots about business showed nearly every executive as a man
_ a white man, at that _ while others asserted that the only job a
woman was really qualified for was supermodel.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the sociological implications of such demeaning
portrayals, advertisers copied the Atlanta Falcons in squandering
valuable opportunities to score. The large audience of women
watching the Super Bowl, far bigger than for a regular-season
football game, were denied a chance to see much they could identify
with and respond to.
</P>
<P>
   How sad it was that on the biggest day of the year for
advertising _ when marketers paid an average $1.6 million for each
30 seconds of commercial time, a Super Bowl record _ Madison Avenue
was turned for the most part into a low road. What follows is an
assessment of the commercials that offended as well as some praise
for the few spots that pleased.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN EXPRESS: A spot for the American Express Co. did not
measure up to an entertaining commercial last year that paired
Jerry Seinfeld and Superman. The Seinfeldian search for real life
after ``Seinfeld'' was clever, but the punch line _ the reality was
as contrived as his sitcom _ was a self-referential letdown, as was
the end when the actors went out of character, which evoked the
close of the film ``Get Shorty.'' Agency: Ogilvy &AMP; Mather
Worldwide, owned by WPP Group P.L.C.
</P>
<P>
   APPLE COMPUTER: This salute to and parody of ``2001: A Space
Odyssey,'' depicting the HAL 9000 superbrain pitching for Apple
Computer Inc. provided an intelligent, low-key antidote to the
vulgar nonsense served up elsewhere. It was refreshing to watch a
spot that assumed the viewer's IQ was higher than XXXIII. Agency:
TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   BUD LIGHT: Two commercials for Bud Light, brewed by
Anheuser-Busch, disappointed in different ways. One stooped to
cheap bathroom gags when two slacker dudes chose to buy beer rather
than toilet paper. The other showed an attractive woman being
terrified by a mouse and easily impressed by a smarmy man's boasts.
Agency: DDB Needham Chicago, a unit of Omnicom.
</P>
<P>
   BUDWEISER: Not since the zoo keeper visited Johnny Carson has
such a menagerie been unleashed on television. All five commercials
for Budweiser beer, another Anheuser-Busch brand, featured animals:
lizards, frogs, Dalmatians, Clydesdales and a lobster that's
boiling mad. The lobster gets two claws up. The swamp creatures
were hilarious as always, though the Three Stooges overtones were
overdone. And it was no surprise to see the dogs squabble like frat
boys. Agencies: Goodby, Silverstein &AMP; Partners, owned by Omnicom,
and DDB Needham Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   CRACKER JACK: The pony commercial, for the snack brand sold by
the Frito-Lay unit of Pepsico Inc., was wonderful. Deft sight gags
and deadpan humor made the spot a worthy successor to clever
Cracker Jack spots by the old Doyle Dane Bernbach agency that
featured the comedian Jack Gilford. Agency: Goodby, Silverstein.
</P>
<P>
   DORITOS: An all-male university is enthralled when the model Ali
Landry sashays through the library in a slinky dress. The students
are huddled under umbrellas when she crunches a barbecue-flavored
Doritos chip, sold by Frito-Lay, and sets off ceiling sprinklers.
Do the books get soaked? Whatever. Dude, this is TV! Agency: BBDO
New York, owned by Omnicom.
</P>
<P>
   FEDERAL EXPRESS: Another winning effort from the Federal Express
unit of the FDX Corp. Kudos to the creative talents who schemed to
warn about sending packages with fly-by-night shippers by mixing up
the Stanley Cup with a sack of donkey feed and Cobo Arena in
Detroit with a Bolivian village. Agency: BBDO New York.
</P>
<P>
   GENERAL MOTORS: Rare twin successes for the General Motors Corp.
in a setting that has proved daunting in past years. Two energetic,
thoughtful commercials made compelling cases for the modernity of
two GM divisions with fuddy-duddy images, Cadillac and Oldsmobile.
``It's good to be the Cadillac'' is an inspired slogan, though Mel
Brooks (``It's good to be the king'') may demand royalties. And
Olds never looked newer than in the spot advising viewers to ``get
out of neutral and get into drive.'' Agencies: Berlin Cameron &AMP;
Partners, the Leo Burnett Co.
</P>
<P>
   HOTJOBS.COM: A security guard fantasizing about his dream job,
promoting the Internet employment service operated by Hotjobs.com,
encounters one bimbo after another ``working'' as secretaries and
actresses. He even clones them when he thinks about being a
scientist. At the end, he winds up guarding a fancier building,
only proving just how unimaginative he truly is. Agency:
McCann-Erickson Detroit, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group
unit of the Interpublic Group of Cos.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   JUST FOR FEET: A barefoot black Kenyan runner is hunted, drugged
and forced into wearing sneakers by white-hunter types who act as
commando raiders for the Just for Feet footwear chain. Showing a
man treated like an animal is bad enough, but this is appallingly
insensitive. Agency: Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi Rochester, part of Saatchi &AMP;
Saatchi PLC.
</P>
<P>
   MASTERCARD: A sweet, charming spot for Mastercard International
uses footage from old cartoons to gently spoof the self-improvement
craze. As Olive Oyl buys a Wonderbra and Droopy Dog gets plastic
surgery, viewers are uplifted. Agency: McCann-Erickson New York.
</P>
<P>
   MONSTER.COM: The Monster.com unit of TMP Worldwide, an Internet
employment service that competes against Hotjobs.com, bested its
rival with a spot that stood out by having children talk as adults
do. ``I want to have a brown nose'' and ``I want to claw my way up
to middle management'' may someday join ``Nothing but net'' as
Super Bowl advertising catch phrases. And how nice that a girl
proclaimed many women are ``paid less for doing the same job.''
Agency: Mullen Advertising.
</P>
<P>
   PEPSI ONE: A weak ripoff of the cult movie ``Reservoir Dogs''
starts with a gang (men in black suits) and ends with a bang (an
exploding car). The Pepsico spot should have ended with a whimper
because that's what viewers emitted after watching this pointless
extravaganza. Agency: BBDO New York.
</P>
<P>
   PHILIPS: A commercial for Philips Electronics North America, a
unit of Royal Philips Electronics NV, demonstrates that sexy does
not have to be sexist. The spot celebrates an imaginative Romeo who
woos Juliet in his own driveway drive-in with a giant-sized Philips
high-definition TV set. Agency: Messner Vetere Berger McNamee
Schmetterer/Euro RSCG, part of Havas Advertising.
</P>
<P>
   7UP: Unfortunately for 7Up, its spot, showing men in black, ran
a quarter after Pepsi One's. Quick, call in the women in white
(i.e., nurses) to administer sedatives to the executives at the 7Up
parent, Cadbury Schweppes PLC Agency: Young &AMP; Rubicam Advertising.
</P>
<P>
   VICTORIA'S SECRET: The subject is objects, women as sex objects,
when tarted-up, dressed-down models parade by to promote an online
lingerie fashion show for the Victoria's Secret unit of Intimate
Brands. The spot brags: ``The Broncos won't be there. The Falcons
won't be there. You won't care.'' Maybe the Year 2000 computer
glitch can strike early. Agency: Resource Marketing.

 &HT;    New AIDS drugs offer more power, scientists told
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ New anti-HIV drugs that show early promise of being
more powerful, easier to tolerate and more effective against
drug-resistant forms of the virus were presented by top AIDS
researchers Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It's good news, since the 14 HIV medications available are not
capable of curing people and tend to lose effectiveness over time.
Several drugs in development were discussed at the Conference on
Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Chicago, a gathering
of 3,000 AIDS researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs, named for the mechanisms they use to halt HIV's
progress, include:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Two new ``protease inhibitors'' _ Agouron Pharmaceuticals'
AG1776 and Abbott Laboratories' ABT-378. Protease inhibitors are
the latest and most potent class of anti-HIV drugs, thought to be
responsible for drops in AIDS deaths since their introduction in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Three in a class of drugs known as ``non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors'' _ Agouron's AG1549 and DuPont
Pharmaceuticals' DMP 961 and DMP 963; and
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  One ``nucleoside analogue'' _ FTC _ created by Triangle
Pharmaceuticals. Other drugs in this class include AZT, the first
AIDS drug.
</P>
<P>
   Early test results in humans and laboratories showed these new
drugs to be effective. But the results are preliminary; the drugs
have not been tested in large numbers of patients and it could take
months or years before they gain federal approval for wider use.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS specialists also discussed new classes of HIV drugs that
will attack entirely different parts of the virus' replication
process.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, many AIDS doctors say it is critical to make the
most of the current arsenal of medication.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists agree the key to long-term HIV suppression is to
swiftly reduce the amount of virus in the blood to undetectable
levels. Because protease inhibitors do this in many patients, they
often are a standard element of drug therapy. But the drugs aren't
always effective.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Dr. Stefano Vella, president-elect of the
International AIDS Society, estimated that under the best
circumstances, a patient would have to take medication for 23 years
to eliminate the AIDS virus from the body. That's far longer than
original estimates, made just a few years ago, of three to five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is evidence, unfortunately, that the potency of current
(drug) regimens is insufficient,'' said Vella. He noted that the
drugs eventually fail for a number of reasons, including HIV's
ability to mutate into drug-resistant forms.
</P>
<P>
   To solve this problem, new drugs not only must be more potent,
but should be easier to tolerate and less complicated to take. Side
effects and complex dosing schedules can cause some patients to
miss doses, which in turn can lead to drug resistance.
</P>
<P>
   New drugs also must dodge cross-resistance, known to affect all
three classes of HIV drugs. This is vital for the continued
treatment of people with HIV who already have undergone drug
therapy and probably have developed resistance, Vella said.

 &HT;    Newsweek: Clinton, GOP, media may all be losers
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The end is near, and we're not talking about the millennium.
After what seems like a decade of investigations and testimony, the
impeachment trial of William Jefferson Clinton is all over but the
shouting. No one _ not even the GOP _ expects the president to be
removed, says Newsweek ($3.50). So why is this still going on?
Newsweek staffers Evan Thomas and Mark Hosenball contend it's all
about posturing and saving face with the right-wing base of the
Republican Party. ``The only real issue is who will come out
looking worse: the president for seducing an intern and trying to
cover it up; the Republicans for their rabid insistence on
prolonging the scandal; the media for celebrating it, or _ most
likely _ all of the above.'' In an accompanying essay, Jonathan
Alter suggests the scandal will affect everything from the legal
system (the power of prosecutors may be weakened) to the children
(young people's attitude toward politics likely will become more
cynical).
</P>
<P>
   Time ($2.95), meanwhile, makes no mention of the impeachment
trial on its cover. Instead, the magazine devotes a large chunk of
its space (12 pages) to the impact hip-hop and rap have had on
American culture. Once considered a fad, rap celebrated its 20th
anniversary by outselling country music _ America's previously
top-selling format. More than 81 million rap CDs and tapes sold in
1998, compared with 72 million for country. At the top of the heap
is Lauryn Hill, who received 10 Grammy nominations this year.
</P>
<P>
   GENDER GAP: U.S. News &AMP; World Report ($2.95) visits American
campuses and leaves wondering where the boys are. At the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, women make up 60 percent of the
student body. Other colleges around the country report similar
figures. Apparently males are opting for fast cash in a booming
economy where air-conditioning maintenance workers earn starting
salaries of $30,000. Females are taking the long view, the magazine
says, entering colleges with better grades and a clearer sense of
goals.
</P>
<P>
   JUVENILE JUSTICE: When two Chicago boys, ages 7 and 8, were
arrested and charged with murder in the death of 11-year-old Ryan
Harris last summer, their confessions shocked the country. What is
more shocking, writes Alex Kotlowitz in The New Yorker ($3), is how
their rights were violated. The charges were later dropped after
new evidence was found, but Kotlowitz notes that the treatment of
the two Chicago youths ``shows just how deeply the special
protections for children have eroded.''
</P>
<P>
   BREASTS AND TERRORISTS: The first thing you notice about the
February Esquire ($3) is the cover. I mean really notice. Esquire,
like Maxim and Gear and Playboy and Penthouse and even Vanity Fair,
has learned that putting a sexy, sometimes semi-clad woman on the
cover boosts sales. Pamela Lee Anderson is the cover girl this
month as an example of the triumph of cleavage in our culture.
Beyond the cover story, though, is a serious interview with Osama
bin Laden, the avowed enemy of the United States who was the target
of a bombing raid in the midst of President Clinton's impeachment
woes. ABC news correspondent John Miller reports that bin Laden has
no intention of wavering in his crusade to get the United States
out of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING RICH: If you want to make lucrative investments, P.O.V.
($2.95) suggests you forget about Internet stocks and blue-chip
companies and try something creative. Some investors have reaped
financial rewards from old movie posters, vintage musical
instruments and wine. One investor sold a bottle of 1995 Bryant
Family Cabernet Sauvignon for $400 two months after he bought it
for $100. And one couple netted $600,000 after an $80,000
investment in South American llamas.

 &HT;    Something lost in era of computer keyboards
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Over the weekend a package arrived from a friend in
California, a thick manila envelope stuffed with sections from a
newspaper. At the bottom was a business card on which she had
written, ``Get e-mail and let's be pen pals.''
</P>
<P>
   An odd thought: pen pals without pens.
</P>
<P>
   The words were in black ink. Someone like Marion Hood might have
been able to guess the type of pen that was used. From the flow of
the ink I thought it looked like a Sanford, medium point. The
script was clear and uncomplicated, with no exaggerated loops or
slants and a nice ease to the way the lowercase ``L'' in ``let's''
made a rightward turn at the bottom and became a lowercase ``E.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone notices these things. Two kinds of people who do
are the hopelessly illegible like myself, trying out cursive styles
every so often like a baseball player experimenting with a new
batting stance, and a calligraphist like Marion Hood.
</P>
<P>
   She is 36 years old, with long, straight brown hair, an open,
friendly face and an informality that suggests something of the
countercultural. She came to Atlanta from Cocoa Beach, Fla., 13
years ago with her boyfriend, Richard Johnson, and they're still
together. ``I had a more radical look back then,'' she says. ``I
had spiky hair and Rich had a beard.'' After 13 years she still
calls him ``my sweetheart.''
</P>
<P>
   In Florida she had been lettering signs for a surf shop, the
kind of work someone like her might find in a beach town. ``I
churned out signs like you wouldn't believe,'' she says. Then, one
night, the owner of the shop threw a party and something not
entirely clear happened and his last known whereabouts was
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Marion Hood and Rich Johnson wanted a change, and Atlanta ``was
the biggest town outside Florida.'' For 12 years she's been selling
pens _ fountain, felt-tip, ballpoint, roller-ball _ at Binders Art
Supply in Sandy Springs (Ga.), explaining how a roller-ball pen is
different from a retractable ballpoint and why left-handers _ like
me _ are congenitally inept with fountain pens (our angle is
wrong).
</P>
<P>
   It might seem like being an expert in buggy whips at the dawn of
the auto age. Even pen pals have resorted to e-mail. But if the
police were to frisk people on the street at random, 90 would have
a pen on them and many would have several. Nothing is more taken
for granted, and nothing more relied on for expressing so many
sides of ourselves, from idle jottings to utilitarian notations to
our innermost thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't take seriously the business that didn't have its
own stationery. But there are letters that would leave you cold if
they'd been downloaded from the computer, the pixels on the screen
translated into perfectly horizontal lines of uniform lettering. I
was trying to make this obvious point in a talk at a college last
year and a young woman, 20 years old, studying computer science,
said what's the difference _ it's just the words, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   I let it go without a response. But I'd been thinking of my
father's handwriting, its distinctive ``J's'' and ``M's'' and
``S's'' imprinted on my mind at an age before I could have recited
the parts of speech. Indelible after so many years, it is somehow
his voice on paper, speaking to me across decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different medium when you use a pen,'' Hood says. ``I
think you will say things in a different way. ``
</P>
<P>
   On a computer screen you can rewrite endlessly, recasting your
motives and actions as you recast your sentences. You can paint
exactly the picture you want. But precision comes at the cost of
spontaneity.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a pen you're going to more trouble,'' as Hood says.
``First you have to have the paper and then you have to write it by
hand. Then you have to fold the paper and put it in an envelope.
And you have to seal the envelope. Then you have to mail it, and
you have to put a stamp on it, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, there's something to be said for doing all that.''
</P>
<P>
   There's something to be said for writing at all, but the pen
_whether a $1,500 Montegrappa or a drugstore Uni-ball (my current
favorite) _ is a kind of high fidelity of the written word, what
the CD is to the song. Without it our words might be clear as a
bell, but the voice behind them grows faint and disembodied. Most
people know it, which is why they save certain words for pen and
paper.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that most of us are pen pals bound to computer
and keyboard, taping out words, shaping them into paragraphs and
something resembling consecutive thought. It is the quickness in
the blood that first gave rise to them that has been lost,
sometimes forever.

 &HT;    Braves pitchers armed for Camp Leo
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With Atlanta mired in post-Super Bowl doldrums and
rainy Monday blues, there came some hope. Deep in the bowels of
Turner Field, Braves baseball began.
</P>
<P>
   Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Nine pitchers congregated Monday morning, with another handful
expected to join them today, to open the eighth edition of ``Camp
Leo,'' the two-week pre-spring training program with Braves
pitching coach Leo Mazzone.
</P>
<P>
   Still more than two weeks away from the early reporting dates of
spring training, Tom Glavine was back on the mound for the first
time since the Braves season ended Oct. 14 in a 5-0 NLCS loss to
the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   This trip to the mound was indoors, thanks to the weather, and
lasted only 10 minutes, thanks to the date. But both felt good for
Glavine, who between ``appearances'' picked up another Cy Young
Award.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to get going again,'' Glavine said. ``This is the
time of year everybody gets itchy to get going.''
</P>
<P>
   In Glavine and Kevin Millwood, two-fifths of the starting
rotation reported to Camp Leo on Monday. Rookie Bruce Chen, who
will take a stab as the Braves fifth starter, was not in town yet
from Panama. Both he and John Smoltz are expected to arrive today.
Greg Maddux won't be joining the team until spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Among the others getting in work Monday were relievers Kerry
Ligtenberg, John Rocker and Mike Cather, recently acquired Mike
Remlinger, rookies Derrin Ebert and Micah Bowie and non-roster
invitee Kevin McGlinchy. Javy Lopez came to do some catching.
</P>
<P>
   Due shortly, along with Chen and Smoltz, are Mark Wohlers,
Odalis Perez, and Rudy Seanez.
</P>
<P>
   Former Braves starter Denny Neagle was back at Turner Field on
Monday, but he won't stick around past Wednesday. His new job is
with the Reds, compliments of the trade for Bret Boone and
Remlinger.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood that Chen, 21, will move into the fifth spot,
makes Atlanta's rotation a bit younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Chen's) not a September call-up anymore,'' Glavine said.
``He's part of the team. But that's one of things about him. He
seems like he can handle (some pressure). He has a lot of poise and
control for not having very much experience. But you'll see a
difference. The first time around seeing teams, as a pitcher you
have a little bit of an edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Millwood, who takes over the fourth spot in the rotation, is 12
pounds lighter and a newlywed. He also comes in fresh off a 17-win
season in his first full year in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I belong here more, I guess,'' said Millwood, 24.
``This year a little bit more will be riding on me. I like it. I
like to have a little more pressure. It makes it exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Remlinger is another possible starter. The 32-year-old moved
into the Reds starting rotation late in the 1997 season and started
28 games in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be a big addition,'' Glavine said.

THE GROOM IS RED IS BEATEN

<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ The Groom Is Red, winner of the Champagne
Stakes at Belmont Park last fall, made his 1999 debut Monday and
found the road to the Kentucky Derby just as challenging as
advertised. He ran third behind Certain, who won a star-filled
allowance at Gulfstream Park for his fourth consecutive victory.
</P>
<P>
   Certain ran second in his first two starts last year, then won
three in a row at nearby Calder. He ran Monday as third choice to
The Groom Is Red, who won the Champagne on a sloppy track but
failed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have any early speed, which is usual with him,''
said Jerry Bailey, who rode The Groom Is Red. ``He made a good move
around the stretch turn, but then he just couldn't sustain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Certain ran the mile and one-sixteenth around two turns in 1:46
2/5 under Shane Sellers, and paid $8.20 for a $2 bet to win. At the
finish, he led another Zito horse, Cryptodiplomacy, by three and
one-quarter lengths, with The Groom Is Red a length and a quarter
back in third.

TWO OF FRANCE'S LARGEST BANKS WILL MERGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Societe Generale SA, France's
second-biggest commercial bank, said Monday that it would pay about
$18 billion in stock to acquire Paribas SA, the nation's
fifth-largest bank, quickly arousing speculation about a new wave
of takeovers in France and across the Continent.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal is completed, the new SG Paribas would probably rank
as Europe's third-largest financial institution behind UBS of
Switzerland and Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Societe Generale will exchange five of its shares for every
eight of Paribas, for a total value of around 16 billion euros and
a 17 percent premium based on Friday's closing stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   As with most bank deals, plans for the combined SG Paribas call
for significant cost cutting and reductions in the work force.
Executives at the two banks predicted that they could save about
800 million euros a year, or a little more than $900 million,
starting in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said there were advantages and disadvantages to the fit
between the two financial institutions. On the one hand, they have
somewhat complementary businesses, because Paribas is much stronger
as an investment bank while Societe Generale is stronger as a bank
for retail customers.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there are not as many easy areas for cutting
costs, because the two banks do not have extensive overlapping
branch networks. As a result, some analysts said the acquisition
does little to resolve one of the biggest problems for European
banks _ too many branches.
</P>
<P>
   The move marks the latest in a series of giant combinations in
the European banking and insurance industries as financial
institutions struggle for position in a European market with a
single currency. But analysts and industry executives said it could
also open France's insular banking market by putting pressure on
the nation's other big institutions to search for cross-border
mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Investors quickly focused on Banque Nationale de Paris, the
country's biggest, as well as on Credit Lyonnais, the
government-owned bank that has lost billions and is being groomed
for privatization this spring.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the agreement between Societe Generale and Paribas
reinforces a persistent trend toward ever-bigger banking
combinations between institutions in the same country. Even though
the new European single currency is hastening the development of a
single financial market, banks are shoring up their positions by
merging within national boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Banco Santander solidified its position as
Spain's biggest bank by acquiring Banco Central Hispano for $11.3
billion in stock. But huge mergers within national boundaries have
also taken place over the last year in Germany, Italy and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some analysts and industry executives suggested that
Monday's deal might unlock the French banking industry by driving
institutions like Banque Nationale de Paris into the arms of
foreign partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are just at the start of this consolidation process
in banking,'' said Rolf-Ernst Breuer, Deutsche Bank's chairman, at
the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ``Someone's really
started to get things moving, and that will open the doors for many
other developments in the French financial market.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank badly wants to buy a big French bank, but has been
repeatedly rebuffed by French political leaders who recoil at the
idea of a foreign takeover. And Commerzbank, Germany's
fourth-largest, has recently said that it would like to make a
French acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   John Leonard, a banking analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in
London, said that the deal announced Monday could provide the
chance that the German banks had been waiting for. ``We see
specific positive implications for the remaining French shares and
for the major German names, especially Dresdner and Commerzbank,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts said the union between Societe Generale and Paribas
was in many ways a shotgun marriage arranged by Claude Bebear,
chairman of the insurance conglomerate AXA and one of France's most
powerful financial figures.
</P>
<P>
   AXA is Paribas' biggest shareholder, owning about 7 percent of
the stock, and Bebear publicly criticized the bank in October for
its disappointing performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bebear made it clear he was not very happy with the bank,''
said Jean-Baptiste Bellon, a banking analyst at Deutsche Bank.
Since Paribas was privatized by the French government in 1987, its
stock has missed out on much of the bull market and has lagged far
behind that of Societe Generale.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris on Monday, Paribas shares rose 8.15 euros, or 9.7
percent, to 92.15 euros. Shares of Societe Generale fell 5 euros,
or 3.16 percent, to 153. Its American depository receipts fell
$1.625, to $34, in Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   AXA was on its own acquisition drive Monday as it reached an
agreement to take over Royal Guardian Exchange, a British insurer,
for $5.68 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our minds, to be profitable it is essential to be the
leader or one of the leaders in the market,'' Bebear said in Paris
on Monday. And, he added, AXA still has an appetite for more
acquisitions in the United States and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to AXA, which has emerged as one of Europe's most
formidable insurance carriers, French banks have been increasingly
overshadowed by their big German neighbors and by the big Wall
Street investment banks that have helped engineer many of Europe's
biggest deals.
</P>
<P>
   French banks, though they are big, are not particularly strong
in other European countries, and many have been burdened by bad
loans in Asian countries and other emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Societe Generale and Paribas announced their plans to
combine, attention turned to the possible effect on Credit
Lyonnais, which has required billions of francs in government
bailouts because of a catastrophic bet on real-estate financing in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to that government help and to new management, Credit
Lyonnais recently became profitable again, and the government now
wants to give control to a group of friendly shareholders that
might easily include Banque Nationale de Paris, Societe Generale,
AXA and even the German insurance conglomerate Allianz AG.

 &HT;    INSIDE PRO TENNIS: Women's game most intriguing
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It wasn't necessarily the kind of publicity the WTA wanted, but
the Martina Hingis-Amelie Mauresmo final and feud at the Australian
Open provided the melodrama that is making women's tennis more
appealing than the men's game lately.
</P>
<P>
   The Yevgeny Kafelnikov-Thomas Enqvist final was simply a matchup
of good players. The women's final had intrigue of a different
sort, and the unfortunate rift between Mauresmo and Hingis probably
won't heal as long as Hingis denies commenting to Swiss reporters
in German, ``She's here with a woman; she's half-man.''
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's edition of L'Equipe, the leading sports daily in
Paris, Mauresmo says she was touched by a note of apology from
Lindsay Davenport, who said Mauresmo ``played like a man'' in their
semifinal, won by Mauresmo. The next day, Davenport blasted the
media for taking the remark out of context.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, you guys love to write the worst line possible,
and unfortunately, you have hurt a very nice girl,'' Davenport
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mauresmo also told L'Equipe that Hingis' remarks were ``an
unpleasant joke.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps she just said it for a laugh, without thinking, but
the next day (in the final) she wasn't very clear either in saying
that I played like a man,'' Mauresmo said. ``It was stupid of
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unwanted attention, Mauresmo said she doesn't regret
acknowledging publicly that she is a lesbian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel liberated, and it's shown in my game,'' she said.
``There are dozens of other players like me who say nothing.
They're often ill at ease and even unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov gets his due
</P>
<P>
   It always annoyed Kafelnikov that the media labeled him an
underachiever because he'd hadn't won a Grand Slam title since the
1996 French Open. Now, with the Australian title, the Russian is
one of just five active players with two major championships. The
others are Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi, Jim Courier and Patrick
Rafter. Kafelnikov's ranking is back up to a career-high No. 3.
Kafelnikov has led the ATP Tour in matches played in four of the
past five years. He played 150 last year, counting singles and
doubles. Meanwhile, Sampras played 78 and pulled out of the
Australian because of fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly. . .
</P>
<P>
   Five players could have overtaken Sampras as the No. 1 player by
reaching the men's final. The list includes Marcelo Rios (withdrew
injured), Carlos Moya (first round), Alex Corretja (second), Rafter
(third) and Agassi (fourth).

NEES TO BUY EASTERN UTILITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ New England Electric System will buy Eastern Utilities
Associates for about $634 million in cash, the latest merger driven
by the deregulation of the regional power industry.
</P>
<P>
   NEES will also assume roughly $400 million in Eastern debt. By
purchasing Eastern's service territories in Brockton and Fall
River, NEES will increase its lead as the largest electric utility
in Massachusetts. It will also become the sole power-distributor in
Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also represents expansion for National Grid Group PLC,
the British Utility that is in the process of buying NEES, based in
Westborough, Mass. for about $4.6 billion in cash and debt.
</P>
<P>
   If the two purchases are completed by early 2000, as expected,
they will establish National Grid as a key player in the
Northeastern power market. They will also give National Grid
influence over New England's power-transmission network.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Sergel, NEES president and chief executive officer, said
the deal fits the expasion strategy set out when he agreed to sell
his company to National Grid last December. Sergel said the British
firm ``indicated they wanted to use the acquisition of NEES as a
beachhead for further acquisitions, and certainly this demonstrates
they have taken a further step.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Pardus, chairman and chief executive of Eastern, said a
sale was inevitable following steps to deregulate the electric
industry in New England. With just 300,000, Eastern would have been
at a disadvantage in competing with larger rivals who are now able
to sell new services in its home territory of southeastern
Massachusetts and parts of Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly we either had to get bigger or look for somebody'' to
partner with, Pardus said. Given Eastern's size, he said, ``It
doesn't make sense for us to stay independent.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal follows several other high-profile agreements as
deregulation enables consumers to choose electric suppliers much as
they now choose long-distance telephone services.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, BEC Energy, parent of Boston Edison, agrees to
buy Commonwealth Energy System for $1.55 billion in cash, stock and
debt. In 1997, NEES agreed to sell its power plants to a unit of
California-based PG&AMP;E Corp. BEC and NEES have also held merger
discussions, which so far have been fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   Like other analysts, utilities specialist Phil Giudice of Mercer
Management Consulting in Lexington expects further consolidation as
fragmented Northeastern power companies seek economies of scale
needed for more effective marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry model is that there will be dominant distribution
companies in large regions,'' Guidice said. The latest NEES deal,
he said, ``only reinforces that projection.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, NEES will pay $31 for each of
Eastern's 20.4 million outstanding shares. That represents a 5
percent premium over their Friday closing price of $29 9/16. The
shares traded around $25 apiece in early December, before rising on
rumors that National Grid was interested in buying the company.
</P>
<P>
   NEES said it would partly finance the deal with some of the $358
million in cash on its books. The remainder of the deal will be
financed through debt, though NEES hasn't yet determined the exact
figures. NEES has about $1.1 billion in debt today.
</P>
<P>
   Following the merger, NEES said it expects to eliminate through
voluntary buyouts about 250 jobs out of a total combined workforce
of 4,100. NEES will emerge with about 1.6 million customers,
100,000 less than New England's largest distribution company,
Connecticut-based Northeast Utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Pardus said he will retire following the completion of the
agreement, along with Eastern chief operating officer John Stevens.
The company's executive vice president, Robert Powderly, will
become president of a NEES support-services unit.
</P>
<P>
   Formally, NEES' purchase of Eastern isn't related to its
National Grid agreements. But in an interview Monday David Jones,
the London company's Group Chief Executive, praised the purchase
and added that ``If it weren't done through NEES, then it could be
a more complicated situation'' because of extra regulatory
approvals that would be needed.
</P>
<P>
   The purchases of NEES and Eastern, based in Boston, will give
National Grid control over a significant portion of New England's
power-transmission system. In the United Kingdom, the publicly
traded National Grid was created in 1990 to operate transmission
wires on a for-profit basis.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in NEES rose 1/16 to $49 apiece in New York Stock
Exchange trading Monday. Eastern shares fell 15/16 to close at $28
5/8 on the same exchange.

ED HERLIHY, 89, A VOICE OF CHEER AND CHEESE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (ms) 
 By RICHARD SEVERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ed Herlihy, a radio announcer whose voice charted the
course of World War II for moviegoers, then for the better part of
40 years spoke for Kraft foods on radio and television, died Jan.
30 at his home in Manhattan. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   In his early successes, few could recall his name or know what
he looked like. But to moviegoers who saw the Universal newsreels
in the 1940s, his was one of the voices that told of the Allies'
early setbacks against the Axis powers, then of the successes that
led to victory in 1945. His two principal competitors were his
fellow announcer Harry Von Zell of Warner Pathe and the radio
commentator Lowell Thomas of Fox Movietone News.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947 Herlihy started his association with Kraft Foods on
radio and continued it when the company sponsored the ``Kraft
Television Theater'' on television in the 1950s. A dramatic
offering, all of it done live, the show featured everything from
Shakespeare to Rod Serling; it was at the center of what critics
would come to call television's Golden Age.
</P>
<P>
   During commercials for Kraft products (``Good food and good food
ideas,'' Herlihy would say), audiences heard only his voice, a
voice he said he tried to make sound friendly. It was an avuncular,
next-door-neighbor, deep, mellow kind of voice, a digestive guide
through the preparation of all manner of souffles, dips,
marshmallow salads and fondues.
</P>
<P>
   He was noted for his ability to ad lib through commercials when
dramatic presentations ran too long or too short. In his capacity
with Kraft, he introduced Cheez Whiz, offered innumerable
entreaties to buy Velveeta and delivered eloquent apologias for the
entombment of almost anything edible with Miracle Whip.
</P>
<P>
   People may not have known his face, but his voice was another
thing. Herlihy liked to recall a summer day in Times Square when he
helped a blind man to cross at 44th Street. He took the man's arm,
and the man said it was a beautiful day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Herlihy replied, ``this is the kind of day the Lord
made for the good guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The blind man replied: ``I know you. You're the cheese man on
TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Herlihy's voice was also heard announcing myriad radio shows in
the 1930s and 40s. Among them were ``America's Town Meeting,'' a
public affairs program; ``The Big Show,'' with Tallulah Bankhead;
``The Falcon'' and `` District Attorney,'' both crime dramas; and
``Just Plain Bill,'' a soap opera about a small-town barber.
Herlihy was also the master of ceremonies for radio's ``Horn &AMP;
Hardart Children's Hour'' in 1948. He continued with the show on
television.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his work for Kraft, Herlihy's early television
credits included Sid Caesar's ``Show of Shows,'' ``As the World
Turns'' and ``All My Children.'' When he worked for Caesar, he met
Woody Allen, then a fledgling writer. Allen was so impressed with
Herlihy's voice that he used him in some of his films in the 1980s,
including ``Hannah and Her Sisters,'' ``Radio Days'' and ``Zelig.''
His other film credits included Martin Scorsese's ``King of
Comedy'' and ``Pee-wee's Big Adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   He also appeared in many stage productions outside New York
City, including ``Camelot,'' ``Good News'' and ``Damn Yankees.'' He
was in ``Watergate: The Musical,'' in Atlanta in 1982. Herlihy
played Sen. Sam Ervin, a role for which he spent $40 for a pair of
bushy eyebrows, only to find that they would not move up and down.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Joseph Herlihy was born in Boston on Aug. 14, 1909, and
was educated at Boston College. He graduated in 1932 and got his
first radio job at WLOE in Boston. He joined NBC in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Fredi; two daughters, Lori Selden
and Jeanne Herlihy; two sons, Donald and Stephen; five
grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   Herlihy maintained an active schedule, even in his later years.
In 1994 he was the narrator for the television version of Allen's
Broadway comedy ``Don't Drink the Water.'' He also served as a
lecturer on the Queen Elizabeth 2, the Cunard liner.

THREE BENEFITS IN CLINTON'S BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few choices better define politicians than the two they make in
their budgets: where to get tax dollars and how to spend them.
President Clinton's budget for the coming fiscal year shows him to
be _ not surprisingly _ a crowd-pleaser who offers a little
something for everyone but not a lot of any one thing to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   For all the Repubicans' complaints that Clinton's $1.77 trillion
budget presages a return to the days of big government, it is
actually quite conservative given the boom times. It projects an
increase in gross domestic product for next year of just 2 percent
when actual increases were 3.9 percent in 1998. It increases
government spending overall by $39 billion _ 2.3 percent _ while
projecting a surplus of $117 billion even after all the program
increases are accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would get the money mostly from roaring growth in the
economy but also from a 55-cents-a-pack increase in the cigarette
tax, perhaps the only assessment that can be raised without a
special-interest outcry, since tobacco manufacturers can pass much
of the increase along to their captured market.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposes $36 billion in tax relief over five years _ not
the 10 percent across the board proposed by Republicans but small
gestures to unassailably ``deserving'' constituencies: the elderly,
stay-at-home parents, disabled workers. The budget directs 62
percent of surpluses over 15 years to shoring up Social Security.
In all, it is a spending plan aligned more with the ant than the
grasshopper.
</P>
<P>
   The budget runs to thousands of pages. But at first glance three
areas deserve special mention:
</P>
<P>
   --The administration has taken note of New England's most
troubled economic sector: its battered fishing industry. The budget
offers $92 million in direct aid and loan guarantees to cope with
declining stocks of ground fish and scallops.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative is a combination of buyouts of surplus fishing
boats and scallopers ($15 million and $40 million respectively);
refitting of craft for more plentiful species like herring and
mackerel; job retraining; and scientific projects to improve
fisheries management and help replenish stocks.
</P>
<P>
   They are realistic because they require endorsement by the
industry itself and because the loan portion of the program _
totaling $44 million _ will require repayment. They are wisely
designed to cushion the effects of severe cutbacks in key areas
like the Gulf of Maine cod fishery to head off those who might
evade restrictions designed to allow stock recovery.
</P>
<P>
   --Last month Vice President Gore previewed the administration's
``liveability agenda'' _ help for communities overwhelmed by the
ravages of sprawl. The outlines of the agenda is taking shape for
New England.
</P>
<P>
   According to John Devillars, regional director of the
Environment Protection Agency, Clinton's budget includes $1.5
million to help communities set up ``Smartgrowth'' initiatives to
plan for future development, to train citizen zoning boards in
communities without professional growth planners, and to clean up
and reuse contaminated urban brownfields.
</P>
<P>
   Millions more will be available to communities competing for
grants. Given that New England is losing 1,200 acres a week to
development and that the region's ratio of land lost to population
gained is three times the national average, the smartgrowth plan
should have plenty of takers.
</P>
<P>
   --Clinton's budget also invests in stabilizing international
economies, especially in Central America, the Caribbean, and
Colombia, which have endured devastating natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Mitch's deluge of mud, water, and death set Central
America back by decades. But even before the storm, the region was
drowning in debt. In 1998 Nicaragua owed $6.1 billion to a host of
creditors, including the United States, Germany, and the
International Monetary Fund. In 1997 Honduras spent a third of its
revenues _ some $410 million _ on debts. It owed $4.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   After Mitch, the international community rushed in with
humanitarian aid. But agencies such as Oxfam America and others
sounded the alarm that devastated countries couldn't seriously hope
to rebuild schools, houses, hospitals, and roads unless they had
debt relief.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget offers some relief, with $120 million in debt
forgiveness, $168 million for arrears payments, and $1.2 billion in
current commitments to multilateral development banks, which
provide assistance to poor countries around the world.

 &HT;    Excluding charges, Avado's income up
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Madison, Ga.-based Avado Brands Inc. said Monday
operating income rose 154 percent for the fourth quarter, propelled
by sales at its four core restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Avado owns the Don Pablo's Mexican Kitchen, Hops Restaurant Bar
and Brewery, McCormick &AMP; Schmick's and Canyon Cafe eateries.
</P>
<P>
   Including charges, however, the company reported a net loss of
$1.6 million, or 5 cents a share for the quarter ended Jan. 3,
compared with $296,000, or 1 cent, for the same quarter a year ago.
The loss included a $2.9 million one-time charge related to staff
reductions and a $5.8 million loss on the disposal of assets, both
related to the divestiture of its Applebee's business. Avado, which
last year changed its named from Apple South, is selling off its
biggest and most profitable division, Applebee's Neighborhood Grill
&AMP; Bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great business, but that's been clouded over the
last year because we're disposing of one of our businesses, which
represents about half of overall sales,'' said Tom E. DuPree Jr.,
chairman and chief executive officer of Avado. ``It's been a cloudy
story for about 14 months.''
</P>
<P>
   The company reported net operating income of $12.7 million for
the fourth quarter, up from $5 million for the same period a year
earlier. Sales were $176.7 million, compared with $218.2 million.
Lower revenue reflected decreasing contributions from Applebee's.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, the company reported revenue of $862.7 million, up
from $808.3 million a year earlier. Net income was $66.3 million,
or $1.62 a share, compared with $28.4 million, or 73 cents a share.
Operating income for the core brands was $44.6 million, compared
with pro forma operating income of $27.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Barish, an analyst with BancBoston Robertson Stephens in
San Francisco, said the company is getting all the concepts moving
in the right direction ``and that would generate operating results
in 1999 that would seem to merit a much higher stock price,'' he
said.

TREATMENT OF MOTHERS IN LABOR CUTS AIDS IN BABIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ On-the-spot drug treatment of AIDS virus-infected
women in labor substantially lowers the risk their babies will be
infected, according to a long-awaited, three-country African study
unveiled here Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Immediate treatment of the women followed by a week of
double-drug antiviral pills for both mothers and infants cut the
risk of mother-to-child transmission by 37 percent, according to
Dr. Joseph Saba of UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS agency.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time such a brief course of antiviral drugs
has been shown to lower infant infections substantially, a finding
with large practical implications for resource-strapped African
nations where each day more than 1,400 babies are born infected
with the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``In developing countries many women do not seek prenatal
care,'' Saba said at the Sixth Conference on Retroviruses here.
``We now know we can make a difference for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year a Thailand study showed that mother-child HIV
transmission could be cut in half by drug treatment before, during,
and after childbirth, a finding that was replicated by the new
African study. But that regimen requires five weeks, beginning at
the 36th week of pregnancy, and it costs about $80 for the drug
alone, not counting HIV testing, counseling, and prenatal care.
</P>
<P>
   The briefer treatment, beginning during labor, will cost perhaps
one-fifth of that, Saba indicated, bringing it within reach of
millions more women in developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be cost-effective,'' Saba said. He added that Glaxo
Wellcome Pharmaceuticals, which makes the two-drug pill called
Combivir used in the study, has promised to discount its price to
meet the needs of poor nations in sub-Saharan nations where HIV
rates are the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of these short-regimen studies, pregnant women will have
access to this treatment for the first time,'' said Dr. Buis Okong
of Uganda, one of the three nations that hosted the study of 1,326
pregnant women. The others were South Africa and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers hope that the new findings will persuade South
Africa's health minister, Dr. Nkosazana Zuma, to allow pilot
projects in that country to test the economic, medical, and social
feasibility of the new regimen. Zuma last year blocked plans to
mount pilot trials of the five-week regimen, partly for reasons of
cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minister Zuma was very open in listening to these results,''
said Saba, who presented them last Thursday to Zuma's deputy and
plans to return there next week. ``The dialogue with (Zuma) is not
closed.''
</P>
<P>
   One unresolved issue is the risk to infants who breastfeed in
the months after the one-week postnatal antiviral treatment has
ended, since HIV can be transmitted through breast milk. Saba noted
that a French group will present evidence here Wednesday from
African studies in Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso that a short course
of the drug zidovudine, similar to the UNAIDS study, reduces infant
infections by 31 percent, even though mothers subsequently
breast-fed.
</P>
<P>
   Okong and Saba said the new results justify the controversial
UN-sponsored study, which randomly assigned some HIV-infected women
to receive placebos, or dummy pills, in order to provide a
comparison with two groups who received antiviral regimens of
differing duration.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the studies consigned some infants to certain HIV
infection, a study design that would not be tolerated in developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a placebo group we would have been totally misled,''
Saba said. ``Now we can say with a peaceful mind that we made the
right choice.'' No more placebo trials with pregnant HIV-infected
women are under way or planned.
</P>
<P>
   The drug treatment used in the United States and Europe begins
earlier and is continued longer following delivery, but it costs
about $700 for the medication alone. Since 1994, it has reduced
infections among infants born to HIV-infected women from as high as
27 percent to as low as 3 percent in some states, Dr. Lynne
Mofenson of the National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nearly 7,000 American infants born each year to
HIV-infected mothers, nearly 90 percent receive the preventive drug
regimen, resulting in a 79 percent drop in the nation's annual
number of infant AIDS cases. About 500 HIV-infected babies are born
annually in this country, a toll that Mofenson said could
``theoretically'' be reduced to zero, ``but we have a long way to
go.''

SUPER BOWL IS SIXTH-MOST WATCHED TV PROGRAM IN HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was unspectacular.
</P>
<P>
   It lacked a cavalcade of great plays.
</P>
<P>
   It featured one great team and one overwhelmed one.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Super Bowl XXXIII lured 127.5 million viewers to Fox, making
Denver's 34-19 defeat of Atlanta the sixth-most-watched program in
TV history.
</P>
<P>
   However, the 40.2 national Nielsen rating represents a nearly 10
percent tumble from the 44.5 rating for last year's much better
game, making it the seventh-lowest-rated Super Bowl ever and the
second-lowest-rated Super Bowl of the decade, sneaking in front of
the 39.0 for San Francisco's 55-10 thrashing of Denver in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the 40s, we're the sixth-most-watched program in
history,'' said Vince Wladika, a spokesman for Fox Sports.
``Whether it's the second lowest of the 90s, we don't care.
Advertisers care about total audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox clearly got what it desired for the first Super Bowl of its
$550 million-a-year National Football League TV contract. It
commandeered the airwaves from 11 a.m. to 10:30 p.m., Eastern time,
with pre-game programming, the game and a post-game show.
</P>
<P>
   Things started off a bit puny, with a 2.1 rating for the 11 a.m.
``Kickoff Show'' and a 2.7 for the lackluster ``Hard Core
Football.'' Keith Olbermann's too cutesy, behind-the-scenes
travelogue at noon logged in with a 4.1, followed by John Madden's
90-minute All-Millennium All-Madden Team, which rated a 5.9.
</P>
<P>
   The four-hour pre-game show weighed in with a 12.3. Although the
game was far from memorable, viewers did not abandon it in droves
for other network fare, like ``Clueless'' on NBC, ``Touched by An
Angel'' on CBS, or the serial-murderer marathon of programs on The
History Channel.

   After peaking at a 41.5 between 7 and 7:30 p.m., the game's
rating slid, along with competitive interest, by 8 percent to a
38.1 by game's end, from 9:30 to 9:50. The halftime, with a 39.4,
outrated the finale. (Each national rating point equals 994,000
television households.)
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the home markets were the most rabid viewers. In
Atlanta, the game registered a 58.2 rating, in Denver, a 51.6.

 &HT;    AT&AMP;T, Time Warner enter cable-phone service deal
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Time Warner said Monday that long distance carrier
AT&AMP;T will provide local telephone service to its cable subscribers,
a deal that may prove a bellwether for the telecommunications
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The deal creates yet another competitor to Baby Bells such as
BellSouth Corp. and marks a breakthrough for both Time Warner and
AT&AMP;T, which have been negotiating since the fall. It may also
affect the strategies of other major cable operators, including
MediaOne and Atlanta-based Cox Communications.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has been trying for months to persuade MediaOne and Cox
Communications to join in a partnership to let it use their systems
to offer local telephone service. Both cable operators now offer
that service to tens of thousands of customers nationwide,
including MediaOne service in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   For Cox Communications and MediaOne, AT&AMP;T's offer has been
tempting, given the recognition of its brand name. But both Cox
Communications and MediaOne have resisted AT&AMP;T's entreaties so far,
because the long distance carrier wants too much control over their
fledgling telephone operations.
</P>
<P>
   While no deal appears imminent, AT&AMP;T and Cox Communications
continue to talk. ``Cox Communications remains open-minded to
exploring a relationship with AT&AMP;T,'' said Cox Communications
president and chief executive Jim Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications is controlled by Cox Enterprises Inc., which
also owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Few observers, though, expect a deal between AT&AMP;T and Cox
Communications or MediaOne anytime soon, if ever. ``So far MediaOne
and Cox Communications have wanted to maintain control,'' says
Yankee Group media analyst Bruce Leichtman. ``That's neither right
nor wrong. The question is, will they rethink their position after
this deal?''
</P>
<P>
   The AT&AMP;T deal with Time Warner is yet another milestone in the
cable industry's push to capture some of the $90 billion market for
local telephone service. This partnership will eventually end up
competing against BellSouth in the northwest corner of metro
Atlanta where Time Warner owns a cable system.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth, of course, wants to be able to offer long-distance
service like AT&AMP;T. So far, though, it has been blocked by
government regulators, who have supported AT&AMP;T's argument that the
Baby Bells have not opened local service up to competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (AT&AMP;T) are trying to put together something so they can
offer one-stop shopping to their customers while they (government
regulators) are blocking us from offering one-stop shopping to our
customers,'' says BellSouth spokesman Bill McCloskey. ``That
doesn't seem fair.''
</P>
<P>
   In striking a deal with AT&AMP;T, Time Warner surrendered control of
its tiny telephone service to the long-distance carrier. AT&AMP;T will
own 77.5 percent of a joint partnership set up to offer local
service to Time Warner subscribers, which number 12.6 million in 33
states. That number includes about 70,000 customers in Cobb and
Cherokee counties.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal, AT&AMP;T would provide and market the
telephone service. Time Warner would provide the database of
customers and the cable lines to reach them.
</P>
<P>
   What was announced Monday was a tentative deal and now the two
companies have to hammer out the specifics. They hope to name two
pilot cities by the end of the year and then roll out AT&AMP;T-branded
telephone service across all Time Warner systems, including metro
Atlanta, by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based media conglomerate, which also owns
Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting, has been steadily upgrading its
systems to handle the two-digital traffic necessary for local
telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   That upgrade is under way in the company's system in northwest
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``This represents an opportunity to get a substantial return on
our (cable) plant,'' Gerald Levin, Time Warner's Chairman said last
fall when first discussing negotiations with AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, AT&AMP;T has agreed to pay Time Warner $15 for every home
along its cable system ready to receive local telephone service.
Those payments, delivered in two annual installments, are expected
to total $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership is also a potential bonanza for AT&AMP;T. With the
addition of Time Warner's cable systems, AT&AMP;T will be able to offer
local telephone service to 40 percent of all U.S. households.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is in the process of buying the Tele-Communications Inc.
and plans to offer its subscribers local telephone service. Time
Warner and TCI are the first and second largest cable operators,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the number of cable TV telephone customers is small,
around 100,000 nationwide. But that number is expected to reach 2.6
million within the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   That still represents a tiny potion of the national market for
local telephone service but even a small slice of it could generate
a healthy return for cable operators. Says the Yankee Group's
Leichtman, ``The cable industry knows that this is a market in
development.''

AT&AMP;T DEAL WITH TIME WARNER ENHANCES LOCAL SERVICE OPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long-distance giant AT&AMP;T Corp. accelerated its return to local
phone service Monday by announcing a joint venture with Time Warner
Inc. that will use the cable company's wires to provide local phone
service to residential and small-business customers in 33 states.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with AT&AMP;T's imminent $48 billion purchase of cable giant
Tele-Communications Inc., the Time Warner deal goes a long way
toward bringing AT&AMP;T full circle from the day 15 years ago when it
was banished from the local phone market by the break-up of the
Bell system.
</P>
<P>
   The deals with the nation's two largest cable companies would
give AT&AMP;T potential access to 40 percent of the nation's households
and company officials say that percentage will grow to more than 60
percent as more joint ventures are announced.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's return to the local phone market follows a very different
technological path from the one it used when it exited that market
on Jan. 1, 1984. AT&AMP;T this time will provide local service over
cable wires rather than telephone wires, but the goal is the same:
to give customers all the telecommunications services they want on
one bill.
</P>
<P>
   C. Michael Armstrong, chairman and chief executive officer of
AT&AMP;T, sounded almost cocky in predicting his company, within three
to four years, would sign up a fourth of the 20 million homes and
businesses that Time Warner's wires currently pass.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said the new joint venture will have a positive cash
flow and generate $4 billion in new revenues within three years,
largely because it will offer more services than Bell Atlantic and
other local phone companies at cost savings of 20 to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about offering more and costing less,''
Armstrong said. He added later: ``Why would a consumer not want an
AT&AMP;T-Time Warner offering?''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street reacted cautiously to the joint venture. AT&AMP;T's
stock went up 2 13/16 while Time Warner's dropped 3/16. One of the
chief targets of the joint venture, Bell Atlantic, said the
announcement shows how the marketplace is outpacing a regulatory
structure that until now has barred it from offering long-distance
phone service in head-to-head competition with AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are attempting to lock up customers before we can get
into long distance,'' said Jim Cullen, president and chief
operating officer of Bell Atlantic. ``It's a sensible policy for
them, but it's not a sound public policy'' to let AT&AMP;T proceed with
local service before Bell Atlantic can offer long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has criticized Bell Atlantic for failing to open its
markets to local-service competitors, but Cullen called that stance
in regulatory proceedings a farce. He said Monday's joint venture
announcement shows AT&AMP;T isn't interested in what Bell Atlantic is
doing but is busy building its own network to bypass Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Wahl, a telecommunications analyst for the Yankee Group in
Boston, said AT&AMP;T's invasion of the local phone market will take
time. ``I think it's a win-win for Time Warner and AT&AMP;T and a win
for consumers as well. But I think it's a long-term win for
consumers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said the joint venture will test local phone service
in one or two cities later this year and expand the test next year.
He said it would take four to five years to roll out local phone
service systemwide.
</P>
<P>
   For a Time Warner customer, the joint venture holds the promise
of being able to receive a variety of telecommunications services,
including cable, Internet, local phone, long-distance, and wireless
phone service. The local phone service is likely to offer special
calling features like multiple lines, call forwarding, call waiting
and conference calling at heavily discounted prices. Company
officials said they also plan to develop new products, like video
telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald M. Levin, Time Warner's chairman and chief executive,
said customers will be sold AT&AMP;T and Time Warner products in
bundles. Hypothetically, he said, Time Warner might give away HBO
or free Internet access to a customer who signs up for a particular
bundle of services. Consumer advocates cautioned that such freebies
are rarely free; usually higher prices for one service subsidize
giveaways of others.
</P>
<P>
   The AT&AMP;T-Time Warner joint venture will have exclusive access to
Time Warner's cable network for 20 years. AT&AMP;T will own 77.5
percent of the joint venture and Time Warner 22.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for Time Warner to upgrade its cable system to be
capable of carrying telephone calls, while AT&AMP;T will pay much of
the cost of delivering those calls.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T will spend $300 million for an auxiliary power system to
run the phone system. It will pay Time Warner $15 for each home the
company's wires pass, or about $300 million in all. It will pay the
cost of hooking up a consumer, which AT&AMP;T said would cost anywhere
from $300 to $500 per home depending on whether the customer
already receives cable and has a set-top box.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, AT&AMP;T will pay a monthly fee per local phone subscriber
to Time Warner. That fee will begin at $1.50 in the first year of
the joint venture and rise to $6 after six years. Time Warner is
guaranteed payments based on AT&AMP;T signing up at least 25 percent of
the homes it passes after six years, although company officials
said that could happen in half the time.
</P>
<P>
   For Time Warner, Levin said the deal allows it to maximize the
value of its cable network with minimal risk. Levin likened the
joint venture to a movie deal where someone else shoots the film
and Time Warner gets a fee for distributing it. He also predicted
AT&AMP;T's involvement will entice more customers to sign up for Time
Warner's cable and Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner currently has 12.6 million subscribers across the
country, including parts of New York, Houston, Orlando and
Raleigh-Durham. In Massachusetts, Time Warner is the No. 2 cable
company with nearly 239,000 subscribers. It also operates cable
systems in New Hampshire and Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Levin said he did not want Time Warner to go it alone on phone
service because ``it is outside our core competence to really have
an integrated telephony offering.''

BRUINS TOP LINE IN SCORING SLUMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ On Dec. 16, Bruins center Jason Allison had a goal
against the Detroit Red Wings, giving him eight for the season
through 27 games, a pretty respectable pace but one that would have
brought him less than the 33 he scored last season.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a particularly alarming situation at the time, but it
certainly has become one. The Bruins have played 47 games _ No. 48
is Tuesday night against the Colorado Avalanche at the FleetCenter
_ and Allison has nine goals, including one in the last 20 games.
</P>
<P>
   Right wing Dmitri Khristich is actually on a better clip than
last year, when he scored 29 goals. He has 20 goals but has dried
up recently. Khristich has zero points in his last four games. Even
worse is his shooting drought: five shots in the last five games,
none in his last two.
</P>
<P>
   Left wing Sergei Samsonov, last year's Calder Trophy winner as
Rookie of the Year, had a fast start but he, too, has faded. In the
first 29 games, he had 28 points, 11 goals. In the last 18 games,
he has four goals and 7 points, with only two assists in the last
nine games.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't fair to blame only the top line for the Bruins' recent
fortunes (they are winless since Jan. 18), but the fact is the club
is struggling and the three leading point-getters and not doing
what they're paid to do.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, Anaheim star Paul Kariya has 268 shots this season.
The entire line of Allison, Khristich, and Samsonov has only four
more than that. You may not score on every shot you take, but you
fail to score on 100 percent of the shots you don't take.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins coach Pat Burns has tried benching two of them _
Khristich and Allison in the third period last week against the
Islanders _ but it hasn't shaken them from their doldrums. Tuesday
the coach is likely to split them up and see what happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to understand that line is being checked a little bit
more,'' said Burns. ``We may break them up. I threw all kinds of
lines out there (Sunday afternoon in a scoreless tie with Carolina)
to try to change the monotony a little bit and it was all right. We
could've had a couple of goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Coulda, woulda, shoulda. The schedule is getting tougher, the
season is getting later, and something has to change if the Bruins
are going to make it to the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're depending too much on their skill level,''
said Burns, who has watched his top line finesse its way to
turnovers and pretty power plays that yield nothing. ``I'm not
saying they're not working or not competing but sometimes you
handle it a little bit too much. Sometimes to score goals when
you're in a slump, you've got to get your face scratched and your
wrists slashed. Those are the things that will make a difference in
the goal-scoring area.''
</P>
<P>
   As good as the penalty killing has been, that's how bad the
power play has been. The Bruins are the top man-short team in the
league. The man-advantage is another story. Boston has one
power-play goal in its last eight games and is one for its last 35
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Burns has been lying awake at night trying to figure what has
changed and what can be altered to get his club back on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Khristich) has got to skate a little bit more and shoot on
stride,'' said Burns. ``He never seems to want to shoot on stride.
He wants to shoot from the stop position. He's good on the
rebounds, he's a great rebound, guy but sometimes skating and
shooting on stride can cause a lot of things. Sammy does the same
thing. He'll give you the spin-o-rama, then the spin-o-rama again.
We tend to forget that he's still learning a lot of things.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Dmitri's area, he's got to skate more and shoot while he's
skating. He's got to get it off on stride. Maybe you won't score
from the initial shot but maybe you'll get a rebound or it might
cause something else. We're trying to do too many things that look
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem seems to be the line's propensity for
hanging onto the puck a second too long, enabling foes to cover
them like a blanket.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've discussed it,'' said Burns. ``I've brought Sammy in, I
don't know how many times, to the video room after a period and
said, `You can't do this.' Sooner or later, you've got to cause
some kind of havoc at the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want him to shoot a little bit more but (his puck-handling
skills are) his bread and butter. You don't want to take that away
from him either because that's what he does best. When he does
score a goal by hanging onto it too long and does a couple of
spin-o-ramas, everyone says, `Wow, did you see that?' But when he
doesn't do it and nothing happens, it's like, `What's wrong with
him?'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like (Khristich), too. When he does make those nice
little plays, or picks a loose puck up and puts it in the top of
the net, we all say, `Gee, wow.' When he doesn't . . . that's the
whole thing. Everybody panics in bad times and we shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns thinks the line is being too particular with shot
selection, which was one reason he put checking forwards P.J.
Axelsson, Rob DiMaio, and Tim Taylor out on the power play Sunday.
They keep it simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you're better just to close your eyes and let it
go,'' Burns said. ``I think a lot of the good shooting scorers do
that. They don't figure out where it's going, they just close their
eyes, put their heads down and rip it. Sometimes the puck has eyes
and it finds a way to get in.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach has tried all kinds of things, including changing his
dress code. Now he believes he has no choice but to break up what
has been his most successful combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your first line is shut down, that's why we may have to mix
it up, nothing is happening with the second and that's where we
have to be a little bit better,'' he said. ``Maybe by moving a
couple of guys around, that might happen. The Avalanche have got
good forwards, a great goaltender, and they've got big defense.
Sometimes it brings the best out of you, we'll see.''

 &HT;    Falcons reign over Atlanta
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (a) GENERAL NEWS and (s) SPORTS categories.)

<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was cold , and it was rainy _ and it was the
prettiest February day this city's pro football fans have had in
more than three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't matter to me that they lost,'' said Luther Davis,
24, hoisting a hastily scrawled banner (``We'll B Here Next Year''
), as he stood along Peachtree Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least they got to the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis was among the thousands who thronged downtown Atlanta
Monday for a parade to welcome the Falcons back home.
</P>
<P>
   In the 33-year-history of the franchise, the Dirty Birds had
never made it to the Big Dance.
</P>
<P>
   So who cared now if they got their toes stomped by Denver?
</P>
<P>
   Not Robbie Strickland of Powder Springs, Ga. She took the day
off, and kept her three children out of school to come down and
celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``But (cutting school) is good for them,'' she said, rubbing the
feet of her 7-year-old, Nicholas. ``The Falcons have never been
this far.''
</P>
<P>
   The parade, scheduled for 2 p.m., was delayed when the Falcon
charter from Miami landed at Hartsfield International Airport an
hour late. Fans and coaches, while deflated, didn't sound defeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys are disappointed,'' linebacker Jessie Tuggle
told a crowd of about 100 airport workers and Delta employees
cheering the team as they deplaned about 1:45 p.m. ``At the same
time, we talked about not hanging our heads.''
</P>
<P>
   Kicker Morten Andersen vowed: ``If we stay hungry like we did
this year, we're going to be back.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the recurrent theme among the throng downtown, carrying
placards like ``The Millennium's Our Year'' and shaking free
pom-poms distributed by a grocery store chain.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Nester, holding a pair of red, black and white jester hats
high over his head, walked down Peachtree Street before the parade
yelling ``The hat of champions!''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Bates, of Alpharetta, Ga. wore a homemade Falcons costume
with black and red feathers on her arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted (the Falcons) to know that we're still proud of
'em,'' she said. ``I think it's more important for us to be here
today because they did lose.''
</P>
<P>
   City and transit officials had anticipated crowds about the size
of the Braves' parade in '95, when the team won the World Series
and tens of thousands crowded downtown. But the weather got in the
way.
</P>
<P>
   There was no official estimate of parade-watchers, but Atlanta
Police said that 3,000 gathered in Woodruff Park. Along the route,
in front of Macy's in Peachtree Center, crowds were three to five
people deep.
</P>
<P>
   As the parade wore on, stopping and starting, and taking more
than an hour to complete, the enthusiasm of players _ wind-whipped
as they rode atop 15 firetrucks _ seemed to sag.
</P>
<P>
   At the Varsity (a famous drive-in restaurant), where the parade
began, they smiled and flapped their arms in the Dirty Bird dance.
By Woodruff Park, some looked chilled to the bone.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves, however, made good on his promise, and
performed the Dirty Bird atop a firetruck, while fans chanted,
``Dan Reeves! Dan Reeves!''
</P>
<P>
   As the parade passed, street vendors, seeing their market fast
disappearing, slashed prices on Falcons and Super Bowl
paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had won we would have jacked up the prices,'' said
vendor Gaynell Robinson, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, sweatshirts that sold for $30 at the beginning of the
parade could be had for $15 by the time the last firetruck passed.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning and end of the parade players and coaches
worked the crowd, signing autographs and fraternizing with fans.
</P>
<P>
   At the Varsity, Falcons Lester Archambeau autographed a barely
inflated football for Kirk Evans of Cumming, Ga., who handed it to
his nephew Zack.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's so cool,'' said Evans. Zack was speechless. He broke
into a nearly nonstop Dirty Bird.
</P>
<P>
   At Woodruff Park, Reeves introduced the players to the crowds to
rousing cheers, the most going to running back Jamal Anderson, who
did the Dirty Bird dance practically the duration of the parade.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta singer Peabo Bryson sang ``I Believe I Can Fly.'' And
Mayor Bill Campbell then steered the proceedings into next season.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell showed the crowd a sign that will be placed at the
airport declaring the Falcons 1998 NFC Champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a temporary sign,'' he said. ``Next year, (it will
say) Super Bowl Champions.''
</P>
<P>
   After the parade, the Falcons rode in buses to their
headquarters in Suwanee, Ga. There, hundreds more fans greeted
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching them play this year has been a thrill,'' said Russell
Smith of Duluth, Ga. ``I just want to tell them thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   With their shoes getting soaked from the wet field, and the
temperature dropping into the 30s, fans still managed to wave
banners and pom-poms, and scream ``Thank you!'' as the players
trickled past.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the players found ways to avoid the small crowd. Not
Jamal Anderson. He was greeted like a rock star when he bounded
onto the balcony and grabbed the microphone to say hello.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys being out here in the cold . . . it makes it
worthwhile,'' Anderson said. ``The Dirty Bird is alive . . . The
Dirty Bird is alive and well.''
</P>
<P>
   Before they left _ some in long stretch limousines _ some
players stopped and signed footballs, hats and shirts. Most just
got their things and left quickly and quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans wondered if they'd see the Falcons like this again.
The team has decided to move its summer training camp to Furman
University in South Carolina, and has discussed moving their
year-round facilities out as well.
</P>
<P>
   Said Emmie House of Lawrenceville, Ga., a 10-year season-ticket
holder: ``It might be the last time they're here.''

NASDAQ HAS ANOTHER RECORD DAY, WHILE DOW SLIPS A BIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices finished mixed Monday after investors,
faced with uncertainty about the future course of interest rates,
chose to take some profits in late trading.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon selling choked off what had been a fairly
broad-based advance. Still, the Nasdaq composite index rose to a
new record.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is churning, but with an upward bias,'' said Bill Allyn,
head of listed trading at Jefferies &AMP; Co. ``There is still a lot of
money pushing stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 13.13
points, or 0.1 percent, at 9,345.70. Declines in IBM and General
Electric more than offset gains in Hewlett-Packard, AT&AMP;T and
General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index slipped 6.64 points, or
0.5 percent, to 1,273.00. The Russell 2000 index of small-cap
stocks fell 1.14, or 0.3 percent, to 426.08.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq closed at 2,510.20, up 4.31, or 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer and Cisco Systems were the stocks that led the
Nasdaq composite higher.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation that Dell might be on the verge of splitting its
stock helped push the computer maker's shares up 8, to 108. Cisco
gained 3 7/16, to 115, on hopes that fourth-quarter earnings, due
to be reported Tuesday, would beat expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sort of sloppy all day long,'' said Alfred Goldman,
chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards in St. Louis. ``We were
doing OK, and then gravity took over and pulled some of the
technology stocks down. Then that spread to the whole list.''
</P>
<P>
   A poorly performing bond market did not help kindle enthusiasm
for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds reacted badly to a report from the National Association of
Purchasing Management showing renewed vigor in the economy. The
report, coupled with news last Friday that the economy grew at a
5.6 percent rate in the fourth quarter, left bond traders fearful
of what the Federal Reserve Board's Open Market Committee might
decide to do at a meeting scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at a transition point, where investors have begun to
realize from these economic reports that the sky is not falling,
that profits are at or above expectations, but that further
reductions in interest rates by the Fed are off the table,'' Thomas
Galvin, chief investment strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, said. ``We need to get beyond the FOMC meeting and come
to grips with the fact that this year the Fed is probably going to
be on the sidelines and that earnings have to be the driving force
behind higher stock prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest technology stocks were among the biggest
losers.
</P>
<P>
   Intel fell 3 1/16, to 137 7/8. IBM dropped 3}, to 179{. And
Yahoo slid 18 11/16, to 335 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, AT&AMP;T rose 2 15/16, to 93 11/16, as
investors reacted to the announcement that it would offer local
telephone service over Time Warner's cable network. Time Warner
slipped 3/16, to 62 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of regional telephone companies fell on the news.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic lost {, to 59{; SBC Communications slipped 1 7/16,
to 52 9/16, and Ameritech fell 2 1/8, to 63.
</P>
<P>
   Major insurance companies slumped after it was disclosed that
the Clinton administration's federal budget plan called for $1
billion in new taxes on deferred profits from the group.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna, the United States' biggest health insurer, fell 3 7/8, to
86\. Citigroup, which owns Travelers insurance, declined 1 9/16, to
54{.
</P>
<P>
   Takeover news caused the prices of Aeroquip-Vickers and Morton
International to jump.
</P>
<P>
   Aeroquip-Vickers, a maker of aerospace, auto and agricultural
machinery parts, rose 20}, to 56, after Eaton Corp. said it would
buy the company for about $1.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Morton International soared 9}, to 35 5/8, after it
agreed to be acquired by Rohm &AMP; Haas, a maker of specialty
chemicals.

TAX COLLECTION SOAR IN JANUARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HILARY SARGENT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Adding fuel to Governor Paul Cellucci's call for a
tax-cut proposal, revenue figures released Monday show January tax
collections totaled $1.57 billion, a 10 percent increase over the
same month last year.
</P>
<P>
   The January collections bring the year-to-date revenues to $8.28
billion, 9 percent ahead of last year's totals, according to Acting
Revenue Commissioner Bernard Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement may prove useful to Cellucci, who hopes to
reduce the state's income tax from 5.95 percent to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty compelling argument that this economy is
strong,'' said Cellucci, adding that the best way to keep the
economy strong is to ``get that income tax back to 5 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Income tax collections for January totaled $1.12 billion, up 4.6
percent from last year. The figure reflects the changes in
withholding schedules, meaning that employers have already adjusted
for new tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, income tax revenues total $4.88 billion, an
8.6 percent increase over last year. Withholding tax revenues were
$617.9 million, a 5.1 percent increase from last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``January is a significant month for tax collections and we can
see that performance is strong across the board,'' Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite analysts' predictions that the Massachusetts economy
could take a turn for the worse in the months to come, Cellucci
predicted ``a good revenue year.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Cellucci was optimistic, he did not dismiss the
possibility that the economy's present strength may not last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're going to see a turndown in the economy,''
Cellucci said. ``I think what we're going to see is a slowing in
the growth.'' Cellucci added that the state could see a budget
surplus beyond the $350 million already projected.
</P>
<P>
   But House Speaker Thomas Finneran heeded analysts warnings, and
said a commitment to cut taxes would be premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose it gives some strength to the governor's position,''
Finneran said. ``It may sound contradictory in a time of such
prosperity, but somebody...is thinking long term. We just can't
look at the short term horizon.''
</P>
<P>
   Finneran said that while the January revenue figures show
economic strength, the state should still be prepared for a
possible fall-out.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran has suggested that if the House were to give a tax cut,
it would likely be in the form of lowering the income tax to 5
percent, rather than increasing exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't expect that every day will be a rosy day,'' Finneran
said.

MARKET PLACE: A DEPLETED OMEGA ADVISORS LOSES A KEY STRATEGIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Staff turnover is nothing new at Omega Advisors, the
$3 billion New York-based hedge fund whose boss, Leon Cooperman, is
described as volatile even by friends.
</P>
<P>
   But after a tumultuous year that saw Omega drop more than 20
percent in last summer's downdraft _ prompting the quick departure
of the firm's emerging-markets managers _ Cooperman is now losing a
top lieutenant and close confidant who, according to people who
have worked at the firm, has played an important role in Omega's
success.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Leeds Jr., who joined Omega shortly after Cooperman
founded the firm in 1991, is leaving this month to spend more time
with his family and manage his own investments.
</P>
<P>
   His departure comes as Omega attempts to recover from last
year's losses. During the past year, $518 million has flowed out of
Omega Overseas Partners, Omega's largest single fund, including
investor withdrawals and distributions, according to MAR/Hedge, a
newsletter that tracks the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Omega Overseas suffered a 6.3 percent loss for the year,
according to MAR/Hedge, while George Soros' Quantum Fund and Julian
Robertson's Jaguar Fund finished last year up 12.4 percent and 2.4
percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Omega's problems came in August, when the fund lost 22.3
percent as Russia's default and the near-collapse of Long-Term
Capital Management sent stocks and bonds of emerging markets
plunging. Other hedge funds lost big in August, of course, but
Omega's recovery has been hurt somewhat by hits in its domestic
stock choices even as the U.S. market rose sharply in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Omega owns 9.2 percent of Canadian funeral-home
operator Loewen Group Inc., whose shares have fallen sharply in the
wake of disappointing earnings, concerns about its $2 billion debt
load, and action by Florida regulators to suspend the licenses of
16 Loewen cemeteries and funeral homes for alleged accounting
irregularities. Loewen is appealing that action.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Omega's stake of 6.8 million shares in Loewen has
lost more than $132 million in value, or 84 percent, based on the
firm's disclosures in securities filings.

   Leeds, 46, declined to say much about his leaving, referring
questions to Cooperman. But he called his departure ``totally
amicable'' and said it would give him more time to enjoy other
aspects of life. ``I've been here for seven years. I'm basically
going to trade my own capital and play with my children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cooperman would not comment about Leeds, except to say: ``I'm
sorry to see Charlie go, but I'm happy that Omega has provided him
with the luxury of doing what he wanted to do. He leaves as a good
friend, and I'm wishing him well as he returns to the life of art
and enjoys his two lovely children.''
</P>
<P>
   People who have worked at the firm credit Leeds for good stock
picking during most of his time at Omega and say he developed a
close relationship with Cooperman. But they also say he lost favor
in the past year for backing Loewen and some other losing
positions, and they add that even seasoned portfolio managers can
chafe under Cooperman's intensity.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``He was important right up to this last year. Charlie was a
winner every year'' before 1998, said one person who knows both
men. ``Charlie was as close as anyone could be to being an adviser
and confidant to Lee.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Cooperman is a top stock picker in his own right.
After the Bronx native attended Hunter College and business school
at Columbia University, he joined Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., where he
rose to become the head of research as well as the firm's top
strategist. Before striking out on his own eight years ago, he was
named top portfolio strategist for nine consecutive years by
Institutional Investor magazine.
</P>
<P>
   And despite losses in Loewen and other stocks, Omega has had its
share of winners recently, including Liberty Media Group, which
doubled last year, and Lexmark International Group Inc., which
almost tripled in 1998. Cooperman's long-term success has helped
him hire six new employees recently, including veterans of
Robertson's Tiger Management and Lazard Freres &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   According to a person at the firm, Omega's total returns since
inception, net of fees, are now slightly behind the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 Index of large-capitalization companies.
</P>
<P>
   But excluding the firm's losses on emerging-markets securities
last year, Omega is still ahead of the index. In fact, the person
at the firm said, Omega's largest separately managed account _
which is run for a pension plan and thus was not invested in
Russian debt last year _ was up about 10 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But for the rest of Omega, which did have large Russian
exposure, ``it was a difficult several months, as it was for a
number of other hedge funds,'' said Steven Einhorn, a former
protege of Cooperman who resigned in December as Goldman, Sachs'
global head of research and has an agreement not to compete with
his old firm.
</P>
<P>
   Einhorn said that after he announced he was leaving Goldman,
Sachs, the two men discussed the idea of Einhorn someday in the
future working at Omega, though he emphasized that both he and
Cooperman would never do anything in conflict with the agreement
not to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding his warm feelings for Cooperman _ whom he calls
``an excellent and terrific mentor'' instrumental in gaining him
partnership status at Goldman, Sachs in 1986 _ Einhorn acknowledges
that his former boss's personal style may not be for everyone. ``He
is a very demanding person. Maybe some don't appreciate the
directness of his approach,'' he said.

   NEW YORK _ Along the Silk Route in Central Asia, in cities
bearing exotic names like Samarkand and Bukhara, the ancient,
intricate technique of weaving called ikat flowered in the 19th
century. Threads, repeatedly bound and dyed, yielded patterns
bursting with colors in textiles used for the rituals of life from
the wedding bed to the coffin.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning on Sunday at the Jewish Museum, this craft will be
celebrated in ``Ikat: Splendid Silks of Central Asia From the Guido

   NEW YORK _ Once upon a time, a Beethoven premiere may have been
a relative commonplace. Not anymore. But one is scheduled for
Thursday night at 8 at Merkin Concert Hall, when New York
Philomusica will offer what is billed as the American premiere of
the chamber music version of the Piano Concerto No. 4 in G.
</P>
<P>
   The 1807 composition for piano quintet by Beethoven (piano
revision) and Franz Poessinger (orchestra reduction for quintet)
was rediscovered and pieced together by the German musicologist
Hans-Werner Kuethen over several years ending in 1997. Robert
Levin, a member of New York Philomusica since its beginning in
1971, came upon the work while researching sources for a recording
of the complete Beethoven piano concertos.
</P>
<P>
   Why did Beethoven revise the concerto? The deed was a favor for
Josef Franz Lobkowitz, the Bohemian prince and amateur musician
whose palace in Vienna was the setting for the world premiere.

STUDY: SIMPLE DRUG THERAPY CAN CUT AIDS TRANSMISSION BY MOTHER TO
NEWBORN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)  (nk) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ United Nations scientists reported here on Monday that
a simple, relatively inexpensive drug treatment can significantly
reduce mother-to-infant transmission of the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   The results are not as good as those from the standard treatment
in Western countries, where prospective mothers infected with the
virus receive the drug AZT starting at about the 26th week of
pregnancy and their babies take it for the first six weeks of life.
</P>
<P>
   But that drug therapy, which can cost $1,000 or more, is far too
expensive and complicated for the poor countries of the world where
HIV, the AIDS virus, is spreading fastest.
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy, which requires taking one pill combining two
drugs twice a day, significantly abbreviates the treatment period.
It worked about as well whether the women started taking the pills
about three weeks before delivery or at the onset of labor, which
in many poor countries is the first time expectant mothers seek
medical assistance. In either case, the mother and baby took the
drugs for only a week after birth.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike treatment in industrialized countries, where mothers
typically receive an intravenous infusion of anti-AIDS drugs during
labor, the treatment described on Monday does not require
injections, which may be unsafe in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   Each pill contains two standard anti-HIV drugs: AZT, or
zidovudine, and 3TC, or lamivudine. The women took one pill in the
morning and the other in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the United Nations AIDS program, speaking here at a
medical conference, said the study was the largest ever conducted
of mother-to-child transmission ever conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph Saba, a Unaids official who reported the findings,
expressed hope that the new strategy would sharply reduce the
number of babies who are born infected with HIV each year. Wihtout
drug treatments, as many as a quarter of infants born to infected
women turn out to carry the AIDS virus _ about 600,000 a year,
health experts estimate. The United Nations estimates that 30
million people in the world are now infected with HIV, and the
number is growing.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. study compared women who took three different regimens
of the two drug combination with those who took dummy pills, or
placebos. Given the existence of treatments known to be effective,
the use of placebos in the trials was harshly criticized as
unethical. But at a news conference on Monday, Saba said his team
could not have obtained the clear-cut results if placebos had not
been used in the three-country African study. ``We feel we made the
right choice and are comfortable with it,'' Saba said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the National Institutes of Health and the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, which were involved in the U.N.
studies, have also defended the use of placebos, saying that
findings from medical practice in the United States could not be
extrapolated to poor countries because of vast differences in their
logistics and health care budgets.
</P>
<P>
   One of the physicians who had questioned the ethics the study,
however, remained critical on Monday. The physician, Dr. Peter
Lurie, maintained that the U.N. study could have come to the same
conclusions without using placebos.
</P>
<P>
   Before the new study, the shortest regimen shown to be effective
began during the mother's 36th week of pregnancy, about three to
four weeks before delivery. That study, using AZT alone, was
conducted in Thailand with U.S. government support, but among women
who did not breast-feed their babies.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kenrad Nelson, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University
who was involved in the Thai study, said in an interview that he
was ``pleasantly surprised'' by the new findings. Nelson said he
had thought that a longer course of anti-HIV drugs would be needed
to show significant benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Saba said, ``Now we know we can make a difference, even for
women who come for care late in pregnancy.'' The studies, which
Saba described on Monday at the Sixth Conference on Retroviruses
and Opportunistic Infections, involved more than 1,300 women in
five urban areas of South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a bit premature to develop policy recommendations based
on the new study,'' Saba said, because findings are expected to
become available in the next few months from three additional
studies in Africa. Two were conducted in Ivory Coast _ one by
scientists from the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta and the
other by French researchers. The third study was conducted in
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Saba said the new strategy ``will be cost effective'' but did
not give dollar figures. Glaxo Wellcome, which manufactures the
drugs, has pledged to make them available in poor countries at
substantially lower cost.
</P>
<P>
   In one group in the U.N. study, 359 infected women took AZT and
3TC for an average of three weeks before delivery, during labor and
for the first week after delivery. The baby took the drugs in syrup
form for a week. In this group, 328 babies were born uninfected and
31 were infected, for a transmission rate of 8.6 percent. That
represented a 50 percent reduction according to a statistical
measure known as relative risk.
</P>
<P>
   In a second group, 343 women took AZT and 3TC during delivery
and they and the baby continued for a week thereafter. There were
306 uninfected babies and 37 infected babies in this group, for a
transmission rate of 10.8 percent. That represented a 37 percent
reduction in relative risk.
</P>
<P>
   In a third group, 351 women took the two drugs only during
delivery. There were 289 uninfected babies and 62 infected babies
in this group, for a transmission rate of 17.7 percent. This
compared with a 17.2 percent rate in a fourth group of 273 women
who took only placebo three weeks before delivery, during labor and
for one week after. In the placebo group, there were 226 uninfected
and 47 infected babies.
</P>
<P>
   If the simpler regimen is widely accepted, it will save about
seven to 10 of every 100 babies who would have developed AIDS and
presumably died from it, Saba said.
</P>
<P>
   While the treatment can save some infants from death from AIDS,
it will not save their mothers, so the therapy will increase the
number of orphans in third world countries, which has led some
critics to question its worth. But, Saba said, ``that is not a
reason to let them die.''
</P>
<P>
   The transmission rates were evaluated at six weeks after birth.
But the study plans to continue following the babies for 18 months
because infected mothers can transmit HIV through breast milk.
Because of family traditions, the high cost of infant formula and
the difficulty of obtaining clean water to prepare it, most women
in the study are breast-feeding their babies.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier research suggests that the protective effects of the new
regimen persist for at least six months.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other speakers from the CDC and the National
Institutes of Health said that development of a national strategy
involving drug therapy, use of Caesarian sections and other
measures could eradicate HIV transmission from mother-to-child in
the United States.

 &HT;    Bulldogs, Jackets gain commitments

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia's recruiting class received added oomph
Monday when the Bulldogs received commitments from a pair of
high-profile prospects and Georgia Tech got a boost when it learned
it will sign one of the state's linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive lineman Kevin Breedlove of Clemson, S.C., and running
back Bruce Thornton of LaGrange, Ga. both announced their plans to
sign with Georgia on Wednesday, the first day of the national
signing period. The Yellow Jackets also landed a blue-chipper in
Early County, Ga. linebacker Recardo Wimbush.
</P>
<P>
   Breedlove is one of the Bulldogs' top commitments. The 6-foot-5,
295-pounder, who will play guard at Georgia, is rated as the No. 2
lineman in the South by Border Wars magazine. He chose the Bulldogs
over UCLA, Florida and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton, a 5-11, 180-pound running back, rushed for 1,920 yards
and 28 touchdowns last fall and 4,541 yards in three years as a
starter. Thornton chose Georgia over Tennessee and Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   Wimbush, a 6-2, 210-pound linebacker, led Early County with 165
tackles and was Class AA All-State. Wimbush chose the Jackets over
Auburn, Alabama, Florida and Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia did lose out on two players. Running back Cedric Cobbs
of Little Rock, Ark., chose Arkansas and Americus, Ga. defensive
lineman Alonzo Jackson chose Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Carrollton, Ga. receiver Reggie Brown has scheduled a news
conference for noon Wednesday.

LEWINSKY REVEALS NOTHING NEW IN GRILLING BY HOUSE MANAGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reliving memories of her fateful affair with
President Clinton, Monica S. Lewinsky was questioned under oath
Monday for four hours about the scandal, as House impeachment
managers sought new evidence to bolster their flagging case for
ending Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky made no explosive disclosure in the private deposition,
according to a source familiar with the session. But House
investigators were expected to spend the night examining a
videotaped recording of Lewinsky's sworn testimony in search of a
new twist in the high-stakes impeachment case.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise move, White House lawyers declined to question
Lewinsky and apologized ``on behalf of the president'' for her
troubles throughout the saga, which Lewinsky's attorney has
described as her ``long nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the opulent presidential suite of a Washington hotel
where Lewinsky was questioned, a new showdown unfolded as Clinton's
private lawyer, David E. Kendall, asked a federal judge to require
the president's chief nemesis, the independent counsel, Kenneth W.
Starr, to show why he and his staff ``should not be held in
contempt for improper violations of grand jury secrecy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall cited a story in The New York Times on Sunday that
quoted Starr's associates as saying Starr believes he has
constitutional authority to file criminal charges against Clinton
while he is still in office.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, who has been roundly criticized by senators in both
parties for the timing of the story, did not refute the report. But
he said he was ``deeply troubled'' by the alleged leaks and vowed
to investigate the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This office has no desire to inject itself into the
constitutional process under way in the Senate,'' Starr said. ``We
are launching an internal investigation to determine whether anyone
in this office improperly disclosed the information.''
</P>
<P>
   An ongoing inquiry into previous allegations of leaks by Starr's
office was launched last year by US District Judge Norma Holloway
Johnson, who will consider Kendall's latest request to cite Starr
for contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, testifying under oath for the 23d time since Starr's
deputies first confronted her a year ago, was questioned only by a
House impeachment manager, Representative Ed Bryant of Tennessee,
who was accompanied by another of the 13 Republican managers,
Representative James F. Rogan of California.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said only that he ``felt it was a productive session.''
</P>
<P>
   Wary of antagonizing Lewinsky, 25, who has been generally
sympathetic to Clinton, the president's lawyers had been expected
to pose questions only if Lewinsky made an unexpected disclosure
that could damage Clinton's legal defense. Each side had up to four
hours to question Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   With a senator from each party presiding, the session took place
on a cold, gray day, in the $5,000-a-night presidential suite of
the Renaissance Mayflower Hotel, five blocks from the White House.
The suite, which Clinton chose for his mother to stay in during his
first inauguration in 1992, sprawls over 2,200 square feet and
features such adornments as the presidential seal laid into the
foyer's oval-shaped marble floor.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, whose sexual liaisons in the White House with Clinton
began during the government shutdown in 1995, was not questioned
about details of their intimate encounters, under orders from the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, House managers said before the session, Bryant would
press Lewinsky on her account of Clinton's alleged role in several
key elements of the two articles of impeachment. Clinton is charged
with lying under oath to a federal grand jury and obstructing
justice to cover up his sexual affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The primary issues in dispute include a false affidavit that
Lewinsky filed in a sexual harassment suit that Paula Corbin Jones
brought against Clinton and settled last year for $850,000;
Jordan's job search for Lewinsky after she appeared on a witness
list in the Jones case; and Clinton's role, if any, in his personal
secretary, Betty Currie, hiding gifts the president had given
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by her lawyer, Plato Chaceris, Lewinsky answered
every question Bryant posed to her, in part to satisfy an immunity
agreement she struck last year with Starr to avoid possible
criminal prosecution. While Lewinsky testified, her mother, Marcia
Lewis, occasionally strolled through the Mayflower's elegant lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall, who has rarely shied from trying to score legal or
political points throughout the impeachment process, sat silently
through most of the deposition, leaving the interrogation to
Bryant. Kendall was accompanied by two other Clinton lawyers,
Cheryl Mills and Nicole Seligman.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the deposition, Seligman read a statement
expressing Clinton's regret for all the woes that Lewinsky and her
family have endured during Starr's eight-month investigation and
the nearly five-month congressional impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   The White House decision to forgo the questioning will be
apparent to senators Tuesday when they begin watching recordings of
the videotaped deposition behind closed doors in the Capitol. Four
closed-door viewings will be held, two in the morning, beginning at
8 a.m., and 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   After taking depositions from Clinton's friend, Vernon E. Jordan
Jr., Tuesday, and a White House adviser, Sidney Blumenthal,
Wednesday, the House team is expected to ask the Senate either to
call the three to testify in person or to permit their videotaped
depositions to be shown on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   The final phase of the impeachment trial could follow, as
senators try to meet their goal of completing the historic
proceedings by Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Presiding over Lewinsky's deposition were Senator Mike DeWine,
an Ohio Republican, and three Democrats who took turns: Senators
Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, John Edwards of North Carolina,
and Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   DeWine told reporters afterward that the deposition lasted from
9:03 a.m. to 3:14 p.m., including a one-hour lunch break and
several other breaks. DeWine and the other senators declined to
discuss other details of the session, citing a Senate secrecy rule.

CLINTON OFFERS $1.77 TRILLION IN FISCAL 2000 SPENDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Basking in the good fortune of a robust economy and
surging tax revenues, President Clinton sent Congress a $1.77
trillion spending plan for the year 2000 Monday that seeks billions
of dollars in new spending while shoring up Social Security and
reducing the federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first move in a battle with Republicans that will
likely echo through the next presidential election. Both parties
predict big budget surpluses _ $2.4 trillion over the next decade,
by Clinton's calculations _ and both want to divert some of it to
Social Security. But Clinton would spend the rest of the surplus on
Medicare and ``investments'' in education, research and other
programs, while Republicans are proposing broad tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basic fairness dictates that some of this overpayment should
go back to the taxpayers,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert of
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``They deserve it,'' said Senator Pete Domenici, the New Mexico
Republican who leads the Senate Budget Committee. ``It shouldn't be
sitting around up here to be spent.''
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma of how to use the surplus was unimagined only a few
years ago, as lawmakers seemed unable to do anything to rein in
rising annual deficits. Now, both Congress and the White House
foresee a booming economy that keeps people working, shopping and
investing _ and paying taxes on all those activities. In 2000,
Clinton says, the government will take in $117 billion more than it
needs under current law, and the surpluses will rise from then on.
</P>
<P>
   Highlighting the political nature of the budget debate, Clinton
released his spending plan at a White House event while, only five
blocks away, prosecutors from the House furthered the impeachment
process by taking a deposition from Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used the budget as an effective political tool for last
fall's elections, when the House Judiciary Committee first approved
impeachment charges. As the fiscal year expired and government
agencies lost authority to spend money, Clinton refused to sign the
budget bills unless Republicans offered more money for school
construction and for 100,000 new teachers.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Clinton is proposing a variety of tax cuts and new
spending, much of it aimed at parents and middle-class voters. He
is asking for $1.4 billion to move the nation closer to the goal of
hiring 100,000 new teachers, and he has revived a plan for $22
billion in bonds for school construction, which failed last year.
Clinton would also give stay-at-home parents of infants an annual
$500 tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   People caring for those with long-term illnesses would get a
$1,000 tax credit, and new tax credits would go to disabled workers
and to small businesses that offer health insurance to employees.
</P>
<P>
   In all, spending for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 would
rise by $39 billion over this year, or 2.3 percent. Clinton's tax
credits would cost $36 billion over five years, with the expense
nearly offset with new money to be raised by eliminating corporate
``tax shelters.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton finances some of the new spending with changes in
investment rules and tax laws that Congress might not accept. For
example, he is counting on $8 billion next year from a cigarette
tax increase of 55 cents per pack. Congress turned down a similar
proposal last year.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 2001, Clinton's budget includes a claim on nearly
$19 billion from a settlement between states and tobacco companies,
which aims to reimburse the states for the cost of treating
smoking-related illnesses. However, there is no guarantee that the
settlement will funnel money to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking feature in Clinton's spending plan is that the
nation would pay down the federal debt, which now tops $5 trillion.
Clinton's aides say this is the true goal of diverting 62 percent
of future surpluses to Social Security, the federal pension
program, and 15 percent to Medicare, the health insurance program
for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The nation owes money to future beneficiaries of both programs _
obligations that are part of the federal debt. By reducing the
nation's IOUs to those programs, the White House says, the budget
within six years would cut federal debt to levels seen before
President Reagan took office, as a fraction of the total economy.
If followed through 2014, the Clinton plan would cut debt to its
lowest level since before World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting federal debt, Clinton said Monday, is ``a rare
opportunity that comes along once in a blue moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders say they agreed with the amount of the
surplus that should be spent on Social Security, but they would use
the money to transform the program into a series of private savings
accounts, owned by each worker. Clinton opposes that idea and says
it would increase the costs of the Social Security program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admit it's a little melodramatic, but this ought to be
viewed as one of the greatest and most important debates on
economic policy since I can't remember when,'' said Henry Aaron, an
economist at the Brookings Institution, whose thinking on economic
policy is often in line with Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   ``This cornucopia of surpluses is unprecedented,'' Aaron
continued. The great debate is whether we consume them today with
tax cuts, or save them for the future and allocate them to shore up
our two most important domestic programs _ Social Security and
Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Other economists said Clinton could not fairly claim the high
ground of frugality.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one Christmas present in here after another,'' said
Diana Furchtgott-Roth, a tax economist with the American Enterprise
Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington. ``Free
pharmaceutical drugs under Medicare. More child care spending. More
money to enforce equal-pay laws for women. He's basically paying
off every single group.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen Schick, a professor of public affairs at the University of
Maryland, said, ``Clinton's legacy will be that he enlarged
government but concealed that by the growth of the surplus, the
growth hidden by the expansion of revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Schick said Clinton's plan reduces federal debt but doesn't make
structural changes in the Social Security and Medicare programs
needed to set their finances right permanently. Those programs
still offer more money in benefits than they are projected to
receive in taxes, though Clinton's plan delays the day that they
have a shortfall and cannot make good on their promises.
</P>
<P>
   Proposing another form of savings, Clinton would commit 12
percent of future surpluses to tax incentives to encourage workers
to open new ``Universal Savings Accounts'' for retirement. But Gene
Sperling, a senior White House economic adviser, said the president
was not ready yet to say whether all workers would qualify, or only
those below certain income caps.

BRAZIL PUSHES TO RESTORE FINANCIAL CREDIBILITY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Monday, a bank holiday was not
declared. Bank accounts were not frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the rumors that swept Brazil on Friday that the
government would curtail access to bank accounts, the government
instead acted to build credibility. Finance Minister Pedro Malan
told Brazilians not to expect an about-face in policy from one day
to the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not have a bank holiday,'' Malan said in a lengthy
television interview. ``We will not have confiscations, blocking or
holding back of accounts, or any kind of surprise of that nature.''
As he spoke, Stanley Fischer, first deputy managing director of the
International Monetary Fund, flew to Brazil for negotiations on
releasing the second installment of a $41.5 billion loan.
</P>
<P>
   The credibility of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's
administration hit a new low after the recently re-elected
government reneged last month on its pledge not to devalue the
currency under any circumstances. After that, the currency lost 40
percent of its value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil's economic plunge this year will prompt the sharpest
Latin American downturn since 1982,'' Salomon Smith Barney
predicted in a note to investors on Monday. The Brazilian economy
will contract 6 percent this year, the Wall Street firm said.
</P>
<P>
   For some Brazilians, like Guilherme Marques, 29, a professional
player of beach volleyball here, rumors that accounts might be
frozen were little more than the work of speculators looking for a
fast buck. ``We have to believe in the government's policies,'' he
said. ``I know Brazil is a very rich country.''
</P>
<P>
   But others were hardly reassured. Marcos A. Solto, 57, a retired
Central Bank employee, blamed the government for the devaluation.
Two weeks ago, the government won a congressional vote forcing
retired public servants like Solto, who collect lifetime pensions
equal to their highest salaries, to contribute to the pension
system for the first time. Monday, he was in no mood to give
Cardoso the benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``This government is a farce,'' said Solto. Since Friday, he has
been transferring savings certificates into checking accounts,
which he heard would be exempt from confiscation. ``The country
does have a way out, but only in the hands of a worthy person,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   With Fischer of the monetary fund and George Soros, the
international financier, both saying publicly that the Brazilian
currency had sunk too far at more than 2 reals to the dollar
Friday, the real appeared fortified Monday, closing at 1.89 to the
dollar. The Sao Paulo Bovespa index jumped 8.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos,
Switzerland, Soros criticized Brazil's policy of increasing
interest rates to keep capital in the country and discourage
inflation. Monday, the Central Bank raised interest rates for the
fourth time this year, to 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a disastrous move,'' he said. Each increase in
interest rates creates higher debt payments, fueling fears about
the country's ability to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Soros also encouraged the IMF to continue backing Brazil, saying
the risk was far lower than in Russia, which defaulted on some
loans last August. ``Right at this minute, Brazil has arrived at
the point where interposing a wall of money would stabilize the
situation,'' Soros said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Brazilian Congress has passed many of the spending
cuts and tax increases the government promised three months ago,
approval came late, eroding investor confidence to disastrous
effect. Now, the monetary fund and the government must rewrite
parts of the loan agreement, in the midst of a crisis the aid was
meant to prevent.

TEXAS-ARLINGTON PITCHER MOVES INTO STARTING ROTATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDY FRIEDLANDER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ A lull had fallen over the crowd at Allan
Saxe Stadium. It was only another game, after all. Nothing unusual.
Nothing spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a loud pop issued from the catcher's mitt and the fans
began to buzz. Then there was another. From out of nowhere, four
men armed with radar guns _ Major League Baseball scouts _ appeared
behind home plate, reading the display approvingly.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks for the wake-up call, Cade Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely has big-league arm strength,'' Texas-Arlington
pitching coach Ron Liggett said of Sanchez, his prize pupil. ``He
could be a very high draft choice next year, depending on how he
throws. There are a lot of scouts showing a lot of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   They'll get their first chance to see Sanchez pitch at 2:30 p.m.
today in Austin, where the junior right-hander will start for the
Mavericks in their season opener against Texas. It marks his first
outing in his new role as Texas-Arlington's No. 1 starter after
spending most of last year in relief.
</P>
<P>
   The move was made because, after a summer spent in the
prestigious Cape Cod League developing a curve ball and a
change-up, Sanchez was deemed reliable enough to join the rotation.
And as an added bonus, becoming a starter should enhance Sanchez'
draft stock, not only providing versatility to his resume but also
giving scouts more of a chance to see him throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how many times scouts called last year and
asked, `Are you going to use Sanchez today?' '' Liggett said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Texas-Arlington coach Butch McBroom found himself
wondering the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get a chance to use him enough,'' McBroom said.
``With an arm as good as his, we want him out there pitching as
much as he can.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because when he was on the mound, Sanchez was close to
unhittable, allowing opposing batters a mere .162 average in 30
innings of work, using only a fastball that consistently clocks in
the 92-93 mph range and has reached 96 mph on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He throws almost effortlessly,'' Liggett said. ``He's so
strong that it doesn't look like he's airing it out, but the ball's
just popping in there. Some of the other pitchers don't like to
warm up with him because he throws so easy but throws so hard.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, his limited repertoire was a concern, as was
his often alarming lack of control. Last season, he struck out 29
batters but walked 30 and hit 13 more.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Sanchez was selected in the 31st round of last year's
draft by San Francisco, which was willing to overlook the control
problem because last season was his first as a full-time pitcher.
Sanchez had played third base at Barton County (Kan.) Community
College in 1996 before transferring to Mesa (Colo.) State College
and giving up baseball to play outside linebacker for the football
team.
</P>
<P>
   He got his shot at Texas-Arlington after assistant coach Clay
Gould saw him throwing 90 mph in a summer league. Last season,
Sanchez showed potentially dominating stuff from the bullpen and
earned two late-season starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, it was just the fastball,'' said Sanchez, who at
6-foot, 200 pounds has lost 15 pounds from his football days.
``That was all I had. Now I have more pitches and more endurance. I
can go out there five or six or seven innings and still be sharp.
By the end of the season, I'll be able to go nine innings and have
my stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point last summer, Sanchez thought he'd be building his
endurance in the Giants' minor-league system. After receiving word
he had been drafted, the native of Salina, Kan., wrestled with the
idea of turning professional before deciding that another strong
year at Texas-Arlington would likely improve his draft position and
his bargaining power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something I thought hard about all summer,'' Sanchez
said. ``The Giants had a scout up at the Cape, watching me, and
part of me kept saying, `This is it. I can be playing pro ball.
This is what I've always wanted.' But I think coming back,
especially as a starter, I'll be better prepared for the pros.
Working as a starter and developing more pitches will prepare me to
take on any role they throw at me.''

COMMENTARY: THE STATE OF RECRUITING HYPOCRISY (For use by NYTimes
News Service clients) 
By DARRIN SCHEID 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arlington (Texas) Lamar High School defensive lineman Cedric
Hilliard had never traveled to the Midwest before a summer
recruiting trip to South Bend, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   He noticed that the skies were different, sometimes more hazy
than the skies are in Texas. He liked the people around town
because they were similar to folks in the Fort Worth-Dallas area,
down to earth and friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Hilliard went back in the winter and experienced some snow and
bitter cold temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   That might take some getting used to.
</P>
<P>
   Hilliard plans to spend more time in Indiana, and he will sign a
national letter-of-intent Wednesday to play football for Notre
Dame.
</P>
<P>
   For the next four years, he will meet high school football
players from all over the country, and he will live in a place he's
never been. He will get to know the Midwest. Hilliard will learn
that people who live in small, farming communities actually enjoy
every minute of it.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, Hilliard is considered a traitor.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, my God. It can't be. He's about to leave Texas to play
football.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no yee-haws for Hilliard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking so forward to it,'' Hilliard said. ``I'm going
someplace completely different, and I enjoy experiencing places
I've never been before. I'd like to go to California and see things
out there, too. I've never been there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilliard is bringing down the percentages, and it's nice to see
he doesn't care.
</P>
<P>
   He is well aware that the big story in every Texas newspaper
this recruiting season is that a huge percentage of the state's
best football players are staying in Texas to play.
</P>
<P>
   The big story last year was that Texas players did not stay in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Big deal.
</P>
<P>
   All people cheer for are jerseys anyway, and it really doesn't
matter who is wearing them. Texas running back Ricky Williams is
from California. Those who follow the Longhorns don't like Williams
any less because he didn't grow up in Texas. Let me know the next
time you hear a fan yell: ``Hurray. We're national champions. Too
bad our players are from someplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   The hypocrisy of it would make for a good comedy skit.
</P>
<P>
   High school students are encouraged all through school to
experience different things. Go places and see the world. Football
players are urged to take all five of their recruiting visits so
they can see the country for free.
</P>
<P>
   Then, signing day comes.
</P>
<P>
   The ones who stay in Texas are heroes.
</P>
<P>
   The ones who don't are making a horrible decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``People never say things to your face, but you read stuff in
the papers about players leaving the state and how bad that is,''
Hilliard said. ``I look at it like this; those people don't know my
situation. I didn't want to stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilliard brings up an even more interesting point. Look down the
Texas Longhorns roster, and almost everybody is from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   How fun is that? You go off to college, and all your new friends
are exactly like you and all the friends you already had back
atLamar High School. Where Hilliard is going, there will be players
from everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Tell me who learns more _ Hilliard, or the guy who spends four
years in College Station?
</P>
<P>
   Hilliard should be applauded for leaving Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The skies might be a little more gray where he is going.
</P>
<P>
   But at least they're different.
</P>

TOURING WALES 
CONFISCATED SALAMIS 
TEXAS BEACHES
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Feb. 7)  
(mk) 
 By JOSEPH SIANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. We are four people who want to tour Wales for 10 to 14 days
without having to drive, and we are interested in forts, castles,
Celtic and Roman history and choral groups. Do you know any tour
operators who can arrange the trip we want? _ Elizabeth Offutt,
Atherton, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. You have a choice of custom-tailored tours or packaged ones.
Let's start with the former.
</P>
<P>
   Leisurelink Visitor Services, 1-3 Castle St., Cardiff, Wales,
CF1 2BS, (44-1222) 522202, fax (44-1222) 529310, uses
four-passenger vehicles that are ideal for Wales' rural roads.
Leisurelink says it will draw up a sample itinerary for you at no
charge. The daily 24-hour rate for a four-passenger vehicle with
driver-guide is $273, including fuel (at $1.65 to a pound).
Leisurelink will arrange transfers from, for example, Heathrow
Airport near London and return. If guides are far from their home,
there will be a $41 accommodation fee. But you can avoid this by
using one town as a base for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Eurowales, Prince's Square, Montgomery, Powys, SY15 6PZ, Wales,
telephone (44-1686) 668030, fax (44-1686) 668029, specializes in
tailor-made tours in eight-seat vehicles. It was established in
1985 by Emyr Griffith, a former executive of the Wales Tourist
Board. It provided a sample seven-day tour for four at a price of
either $1,240 a person, double occupancy, with accommodations at
historic inns, or $1,373 at country house hotels. It includes
breakfasts, guide services and guide accommodations, admission
fees, fuel and taxes. Prices will vary based on your tastes.
Remember, too, that air fare and a tip for your driver-guide are
not included in these prices.
</P>
<P>
   Because Wales is compact (180 miles from north to south and 60
miles at its shortest from east to west), most packaged tours are
shorter than the 10 to 14 days you requested. For example, Unique
British Tours, (888) 277-1722, has a seven-day Grand Tour of Wales
with a guide and minibus that includes airport pickup, all meals
and superior-class accommodations and entrance fees. It stops at
castles and you will hear a performance by one of Wales' many male
choirs. Price: $1,900 a person, double occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   Trafalgar Tours, (800) 854-0103, offers Best of Wales, a fully
escorted nine-day motorcoach tour visiting London, Caernarvon,
Snowdonia, St. David's, Cardiff and Bath. It costs $890 a person,
double occupancy, for June departure and includes some meals but
not the air fare. A similar nine-day tour is offered by Globus,
(800) 851-0728, for $849 a person, double occupancy and can be
arranged through a travel agent.
</P>
<P>
   For more on Wales, call the British Tourist Authority at (800)
462-2748.
</P>
<P>
   Puzzling Customs
</P>
<P>
   Q. In December, we returned from Rome to Philadelphia's airport,
the first time we had ever returned through that airport. The
Customs officials confiscated our Italian salamis, which were
vacuum wrapped, and did the same when another couple tried to bring
in German sausages and canned meats. But we were allowed to keep
cheeses. In the last four years, we have been to France six times,
and the sausages we brought back were never confiscated. These
inconsistencies make me wonder: What exactly are the rules? _
Bullets Gillespie, Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   A. Customs inspectors are responsible for enforcing about 400
regulations from 40 federal agencies. The rules in this case are
those of the Animal Plant Health Inspection Service, part of the
Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Customs Service Web site,
www.customs.ustreas.com, any cured cheeses can be brought into this
country. It goes on to say: ``Meats, livestock, poultry, and their
byproducts (such as ham, frankfurters, sausage, pate), are either
prohibited or restricted from entering the United States, depending
on the animal disease condition in country of origin. Fresh meat is
generally prohibited from most countries. Canned meat is permitted
if the inspector can determine that it is commercially canned,
cooked in the container, hermetically sealed, and can be kept
without refrigeration. Other canned, cured, or dried meat is
severely restricted from most countries.''
</P>
<P>
   If there appear to be inconsistencies based on your experiences,
it is because inspectors can exercise discretion, based on
livestock health conditions around the world. And, alas, your
sopressata was probably barred from entry because of two separate
hog-cholera outbreaks. Neither were in countries anywhere near
Italy, but in protecting American livestock from this blight and
others, such as Mad Cow Disease, Customs likes to play it safe.

   In the future, either contact USDA-APHIS-VS, Federal Building,
6506 Belcrest Rd., Hyattsville, Md. 20782 or call (301) 734-7830
for detailed requirements before you go, or buy a loaf of bread
with those salamis and stop for a picnic.

   Meeting Halfway

   Q. My adult son and I plan a trip together in May or June, to a
place where the climate would allow some ocean swimming and other
outdoor activities. He lives in Walnut Creek, just outside Oakland,
Calif., and we'd like to pick a spot roughly in between our homes.
Any suggestions? _ Allan Weitzenhoffer, White Plains, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. If you and your son want to split the flight time and air
fares somewhat evenly, and you're looking for good beaches,
someplace along the Gulf Coast is the best idea. To help you
compare, we chose an arbitrary departure date, May 15 (a Saturday),
with return a week later, and shopped for air fares on the Web.
These fares were available as of Feb. 1, and could change by the
time you reserve, but they give an idea of what you and your son
can expect to pay, and the differences between the fares.
</P>
<P>
   Galveston, a short drive from Houston, has beaches along its
famous Strand, and is bustling with perhaps the widest range of
activities among Texas coast cities. The round-trip fare for May 15
from New York to Houston is $257; from San Francisco, it's $202.
</P>
<P>
   Corpus Christi has nicer beaches, and is much more low key, with
fewer activities. The fares are higher: $306 to $348 round trip
from New York to Corpus Christi and $287 from San Francisco. You
and your son will each have to change planes in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, the tourist amenities are scarce along the gulf until
you reach the Yucatan Peninsula. Cancun is popular, with beaches,
resorts and archeological sites. Air fares: $388 for you, $434 for
your son.

   CARACAS, Venezuela _ Since his election seven weeks ago,
``Hurricane Hugo,'' as President-elect Hugo Chavez is popularly
called, has barnstormed Europe, Latin America and the United States
sending mixed signals about how he will govern Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday he will put on the presidential sash at an
inauguration that will launch what promises to be a presidency of
surprises.
</P>
<P>
   The 44-year-old former lieutenant colonel has promised a
revolution to clean up the government's chronic corruption. He also
pledges to break the stranglehold of the two traditional political
parties by holding a referendum that would lead to the drafting of
a new constitution.
</P>
<P>
   But on other matters, like how he will manage the ailing
economy, deal with the United States and Cuba and recalibrate the
flow of oil exports, analysts say he remains a question mark.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has been an international curiosity since he tried
unsuccessfully to overthrow an elected civilian government with a
military coup in 1992. Afterward he was cashiered from the
Venezuelan Army and spent two years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his checkered relations with some in the military, he
made the red beret worn by many army units the symbol of his
election campaign and proclaimed his admiration for Fidel Castro
and the Cuban Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Since his election he has been wearing well-tailored suits, but
Chavez has basked in his bad-boy image. ``I am being compared to
Mussolini, Hitler or even the devil,'' he told reporters in Paris
last month with a characteristic guffaw. ``But I am a social
fighter and a democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's globe-trotting was aimed at polishing his image and
calming foreign investors who steadily withdrew money from
Venezuela's stock market last year in anticipation of his election.
</P>
<P>
   Here and abroad, he told investors that he would not impose
exchange controls or default on the national debt. He said he would
defend the Venezuelan currency, the bolivar, even though analysts
say it is at least 25 percent overvalued. He also promised to slash
the government's bureaucracy, strengthen central bank automony,
raise the sales tax and encourage foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   With oil prices at a 12-year low and the government's interest
payments on its debt expected to rise to 40 percent of the budget
this year, analysts say Chavez will probably have little room to
maneuver if he wishes to avert the kind of currency turbulence now
unsettling the Brazilian economy.
</P>
<P>
   On oil policy, Chavez's aides have said they would support
efforts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to
raise the price of crude. But they would not commit themselves to a
production cut.
</P>
<P>
   While campaigning Chavez promised to reverse Venezuela's
practice of pumping more than its OPEC quota. Venezuela is the
leading source of foreign oil to the United States and is the
second-biggest petroleum exporter in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cliche is that there are two Chavezes and we don't know
which one will be inaugurated,'' said Roberto Bottome, editor of a
Venezuelan business journal. ``He has moderated his message in tone
if not in content.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Chavez's oratory has remained hard to decipher in recent
weeks as he has painted himself as both an economic realist and a
left-leaning populist.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago Chavez told a group of businessmen that he wanted
to install a system ``where market forces truly work, where the
state will be the engine of progress.'' In Washington last week,
Chavez met with President Clinton for 20 minutes and pledged his
commitment to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But on a visit to Cuba last month, Chavez embraced President
Castro anew.

COURT, REJECTING RACIAL ARGUMENT, UPHOLDS N.J. DEATH PENALTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Rejecting the argument that New Jersey's death
penalty is imposed disproportionately on blacks, the state's
Supreme Court upheld New Jersey's capital punishment law Monday and
affirmed the death sentence for a black man convicted of a 1992
murder during a gas station robbery.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-1 vote by the justices followed nearly two years of
deliberation and a court-ordered study that found that blacks and
whites convicted of capital crimes in New Jersey had been sentenced
to death in nearly equal percentages.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice Deborah Poritz, who wrote the majority decision,
rejected the contention of a death row inmate, Donald Loftin, that
he had received a disproportionately harsh sentence or that race
``operated as an impermissible factor in the imposition of the
death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   The court also discounted the assertion by the New Jersey public
defender's office that the blacks convicted of capital crimes
against whites were 20 percent more likely to be sentenced to die
than other defendants.
</P>
<P>
   But despite its support for the law, the court did not seem
supportive of the efforts of Gov. Christie Whitman and other
politicians who have sought to speed the pace of the death penalty
process by limiting condemned defendants' right to appeal. The
decision, in fact, staunchly proclaimed the court's right to hear
appeals without ``legislative interference.''

HUGE EXPLOSION KILLS 1, INJURES 16 AT FORD'S RIVER ROUGE COMPLEX 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.) (sw) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ A thunderous explosion, followed by a fire
that burned for several hours, killed one worker and seriously
injured at least 16 on Monday at the Ford Motor Co.'s River Rouge
complex, long a symbol of American industrial strength that put the
nation on wheels by building the Model T.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion and fire heavily damaged the complex's power
plant, which normally produces enough electricity to supply the
residential needs of a city the size of Boston. Ford and Rouge
Steel, a subsidiary that Ford spun off in 1989, were forced to
close all six factories in the Rouge complex and send home
virtually all of the factories' 10,000 workers until further
notice.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the explosion, which occurred in a boiler at about
1 p.m., was not known.
</P>
<P>
   Charles N. Jeffress, the assistant secretary of labor for
occupational safety and health in Washington, said that although
industrial accidents involving similar numbers of injuries were
fairly common, it was extremely rare to have such a broad and
immediate economic effect from an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan is one of 23 states in which state officials, instead
of federal ones, investigate workplace mishaps, and these state
investigators will start as soon as firefighters declare the site
safe, Jeffress said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the dead and injured, three workers were missing
on Monday night. Ford officials said that they hoped these workers
had left their posts before the accident. Many of the injured were
severely burned and three were in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Auto industry workers have a rate of injuries and work-related
illnesses that is two-and-a-half times that of the average for all
workers in the private sector, according to the federal Bureau of
Labor Statistics. But Ford has had a fairly good record until now,
maintaining a large staff to investigate ways to improve workplace
safety, Jeffress said.
</P>
<P>
   William Clay Ford Jr., the Ford Motor Co.'s chairman, arrived at
the factory less than two hours after the explosion, as
firefighters were still trying to put out the blaze, and said that
the loss of life and injuries made Monday ``the worst day of my
life.'' A great-grandson of Henry Ford, Ford emphasized safety and
environmental issues as a member of Ford's board before reasserting
the Ford family's control of the company last fall and becoming the
chairman at the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor's headquarters is still located about two miles from
the Rouge complex here in this southwestern suburb of Detroit.
Started in 1918, the factory complex employed nearly 100,000
workers at its peak in the late 1940s. The complex took raw iron
ore, timber, rubber and other raw materials and turned them into
cars. While Henry Ford perfected assembly-line production and built
the first Model T's at another, smaller factory in nearby Highland
Park, Mich., it was the Rouge complex that became a symbol of
American mass production after World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent factory complexes were less ambitious, buying more of
their parts from outside suppliers. Ford now builds the Mustang and
many auto parts here.
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials refused to speculate on Monday night on when the
aging factories here would reopen, saying that their first concern
was for their workers' safety. The unionized workers here will
continue to be paid.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While the official cause of explosion was still a mystery on
Monday night, a man identifying himself as a power plant foreman
called a local radio station and said that sensors had alerted to
him a problem with a ``pressure relief valve'' on a boiler.
</P>
<P>
   After the explosion, flames leaped from the top floor of the
factory for several hours. The factory building is the equivalent
of 20 stories and covers most of a city block; its eight
smokestacks are 600 feet high.
</P>
<P>
   George McPartlin, a Ford employee who used to work inside the
plant and stood outside it on Monday afternoon, said that the top
floor was where coal dust was blown by powerful fans as fuel into
the boilers. He raced to the factory on Monday afternoon to make
sure that his brother, Larry, a power plant electrician, was safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had soot all over his clothes and he was shaking'' but was
not injured, McPartlin said, adding that his brother had told him
that the explosion occurred in a boiler that had just been repaired
and only turned on again on Sunday night.

PEPSICO SAYS ITS EARNINGS WERE HIGHER THAN PREDICTED
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pepsico Inc. announced its fourth-quarter earnings after the
market closed on Monday, painting a picture that was largely
positive for its soft drink, snack food and orange juice
businesses. Earnings per diluted share came in at 24 cents for the
quarter, a penny higher than analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
   The company credited momentum in its soft-drink business for
much of its success, noting that its North American sales volume
had grown 10 percent in the quarter and 6 percent for all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pepsi One, our new one-calorie cola, led the growth in the
fourth quarter,'' the chairman and chief executive of Pepsico,
Roger A. Enrico, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that growth may have come at a steep price. Pepsi-Cola's
profits in North America fell 21 percent in the quarter, which was
the result of intensive advertising and promotional spending, as
well as ``a very competitive pricing environment,'' said Richard M.
Detwiler Jr., a Pepsico spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi and its chief rival, the Coca-Cola &UR;  &LR; Co., have been engaged
in a price battle at the supermarket and other retail outlets for
most of the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico had announced last week that it was taking 17 cents in
various one-time charges against earnings to cover losses in
business areas like Russia, where the company had an unusual charge
of $218 million, and to cover the costs of certain Frito-Lay plant
closings in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of Russia, though Asia also played a role,
international Pepsi-Cola sales fell 12 percent compared with the
fourth quarter a year ago. Worldwide operating profits in the
soft-drink division were down 33 percent, the company said,
attributing that to competitive pricing, higher advertising and
marketing expenses, and the unraveling of the Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
   Other areas of concern include Brazil, where sales of Frito-Lay
products fell 3 percent, according to the earnings statement.
``That's a little disappointing,'' said Jennifer Solomon, an
analyst for Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, international profits from Frito-Lay, which makes up
half of Pepsico's earnings, fell 6 percent in the quarter, while
North American profits rose 3 percent. Worldwide, Frito-Lay posted
a 1 percent gain in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi reported fourth-quarter sales of $7.19 billion, up 15
percent from $6.26 billion in the fourth quarter of 1997. Net
income declined 10 percent, to $361 million from $401 million in
the period a year earlier. The earnings announcement was made after
the stock market closed. Earlier, shares of Pepsi fell 87.5 cents,
to $38.125.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the critical drivers in 1999 will be the strength in
profit growth of the Frito-Lay business,'' said Andrew M. Conway,
an analyst for Morgan Stanley, who estimates that growth at 9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide Pepsi-Cola volume grew 7 percent in the quarter,
mostly driven by the 10 percent gain in North American volume, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Pepsi One, the leading brands were Mountain Dew,
Pepsi, Lipton Brisk iced tea and Pepsi's bottled water brand,
Aquafina.  &QL;

CLINTON PROPOSES 81 TAX INCREASES AND 37 CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BUDGET-CLINTON, BUDGET-ASSESS, BUDGET-SPEND) 
(lb) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's budget includes a grab bag of
small tax cuts for some Americans and small tax increases for
others. Many of these tax proposals seem unlikely to get far in the
Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen such a kitchen-sink approach to government,''
said Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, which takes first crack at tax legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans like Archer prefer an across-the-board reduction in
income-tax rates for all taxpayers, but it is far from clear that
such an approach can be enacted in the face of a likely
presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
   As tallied by congressional committee staff members, who added
all the pluses and minuses in the budget's revenue tables, Clinton
proposed 81 separate tax increases totaling $82 billion over the
next five years and 37 tax cuts totaling $36 billion over the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   The largest amount of new revenue anticipated in the budget
would be generated by the president's tobacco policy. Clinton would
raise nearly $35 billion over five years by increasing the federal
tax on cigarettes, now 24 cents a pack, by an additional 55 cents.
And he would raise an additional $19 billion by insisting that the
federal government get a share of the money that states will
receive from their lawsuits against the cigarette manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   This revenue may not materialize. Last year, the Senate rejected
a proposed increase in cigarette taxes, and the measure never got
off the ground in the House. Furthermore, the states have resisted
sharing with Washington the proceeds from their lawsuits, and
measures are pending in Congress that would block attempts to
recoup the money.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the president's tax proposals do stand a fair chance of
enactment. For example, Clinton proposed a tax cut of up to $1,000
to defray some of the cost of long-term care for elderly or
disabled dependents. A similar proposal was part of the Contract
With America, the platform on which Republicans ran when they won
control of the House in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Clinton proposal, taxpayers could claim this credit if
they provided more than half the support of someone who was in a
nursing home or required other long-term care. The credit would be
reduced for taxpayers with incomes above $75,000, or $110,000 for a
couple filing a joint return.
</P>
<P>
   The president's proposal for a tax credit to offset some of the
cost of child care might stand a slightly better chance this year
because, to appeal to Republicans, the administration added a
modest new benefit for parents who stay home to take care of their
own children.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton recommended increasing to 50 percent from 30 percent the
proportion of child-care costs that could be written off by
families with annual incomes below $30,000. The credit would be
gradually reduced for families with incomes between $30,000 and
$59,000 and would be 20 percent of allowable expenses for those
with incomes above $59,000.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the president proposed an extra tax cut of up to
$250 for families with infants who have not reached their first
birthday. This credit would be available even if the family had no
child-care expenses because a stay-at-home parent or unpaid
relative watched the infant.
</P>
<P>
   The tax credit for long-term care expenses would cost $5 billion
over five years. The expanded child-care credit would cost slightly
more than $6 billion over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting the cigarette-tax increase, these are among the
largest of the president's tax proposals. In a budget with total
five-year revenues of about $10 trillion, they are hardly more than
asterisks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many of the president's tax proposals have been offered in the
past and have been rejected out of hand by Congress. Among these
are arcane proposals to change the way airline tickets are taxed,
to alter the tax rules on exports by manufacturers and to raise
taxes on certain life-insurance transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The House Ways and Means Committee staff experts calculated on
Monday that 35 of the 81 revenue increases in the budget are
essentially repeats of measures that were rejected last year. Of
the $82 billion in additional revenue proposed, more than $60
billion would be accounted for by these reprised offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The budget describes many of these proposals as attempts to
``eliminate unwarranted benefits.'' But the beneficiaries obviously
do not view them that way, and the Republican Congress has been
reluctant to end any but the most indefensible tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   As a political matter, the battle over taxes this year is not
likely to be over whether these small tax breaks are justified, but
rather over the broader question of whether part of the budget
surplus should be used for an across-the-board tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans argue that it is much more efficient economically to
give everyone a tax reduction than to follow Clinton's course and
give small tax cuts for particular purposes like school
construction or promotion of energy efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The president has threatened to veto an overall tax cut, saying
wealthy people would be the big winners.

MASS. SPEAKER SOFTENS POSITION ON CASINO GAMBLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Softening his position on legalized gambling, House
Speaker Thomas M. Finneran said Monday building a casino in Boston
might be a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to questions about New Hampshire's plan to legalize
slot machines to help pay for education programs, Finneran said
Massachusetts can not afford to reject expanded gaming if that
happens.
</P>
<P>
   And in a move that will put him at odds with the Wampanoag
Tribe, which is trying to build a casino in Southeastern
Massachusetts, Finneran said the casino should be located in Boston
_ where a new convention center and several hotels are now being
built.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're getting into this for purposes of revenue, rather
than dilute it all over the place in two or three or four locations
in Massachusetts, you want to make it a destination point as
Foxwoods has become a destination point,'' Finneran said. ``I don't
think it's really too much of an arguable position to say that the
destination point of greatest attraction in Massachusetts remains
Boston and that is likely to remain the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Thomas M. Menino, who favored the idea of a casino in
Boston during the Megaplex debate, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran's remarks follow those of Attorney General Thomas F.
Reilly, who, unlike his predecessor Scott Harshbarger, said he is
not morally opposed to gaming and would not challenge in court a
move to legalized casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the House and Senate would need to approve
legislation authorizing expanded gambling in the state. The last
time the issue was before the Legislature two years ago, it was
overwhelmingly voted down, with Finneran arguing against it.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker's recent comments on the subject, especially
Monday's, signal a change of heart that is perplexing to many,
including Representative Daniel E. Bosley, chairman of the
Government Regulations Committee and a key player in the gambling
debate on Beacon Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran said he would wait to see what that panel recommends
before determining whether to limit gambling to one casino in
Boston or whether to allow racetracks to add slot machines or
scatter gaming throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the appropriate solution is,'' Finneran
said.
</P>
<P>
   A key sign on how far Finneran is willing to push the gambling
issue may come Tuesday when he announces his committee
chairmanships. Bosely, who authored an in-depth report two years
ago opposing casino gambling, could be replaced with someone more
amenable to the speaker's softened position on gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran would not disclose his committee choices.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the Boston delegation on Beacon Hill could
not be reached for comment.But Representative Paul C. Demakis, a
Back Bay Democrat, said he remains opposed to casino gambling,
especially in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say whether I'm surprised or not,'' Demakis
said of Finneran's remarks. ``We don't need casino gambling in
Boston for our economy or to attract visitors and tourists here. It
would invite all the things associated with it, including higher
crime and compulsive gambling.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he has changed his mind about legalized gambling,
Finneran said he would characterize himself as a ``skeptic
regarding many of the claims (surrounding the issue) but at the
same time I'm not taking any kind of a moral position that somehow
or another this would be sinful for the Massachusetts government to
sanction or authorize.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, Massachusetts already has legalized gambling
in the form of the Lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a little bit inconsistent for anybody in the State
House to talk about trying to take a moral tone, strike a moral
position on it,'' Finneran said.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks surprised Bosley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that interesting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to remember that Foxwoods is in the middle of
nowhere,'' Bosley said of the Ledyard, Conn., casino. ``Not in the
middle of our biggest city. To put that here means a
disproportionate share of revenue would come from the poorest
people in Massachusetts. So you're not going to get the revenue
bump that you think you will.''
</P>
<P>
   Bosley also said opening the door to one casino would open up
the entire state to gambling, enabling Indian tribes, including the
Wampanoags, to push forward with their plans for high-stakes
gambling. It could also allow racetracks to argue for slot machines
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will have a very, very negative impact on your Lottery,
which goes directly back to cities and towns,'' he said.

COMMENTARY: THE STATE OF RECRUITING HYPOCRISY (For use by NYTimes
News Service clients) 
By DARRIN SCHEID 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arlington (Texas) Lamar High School defensive lineman Cedric
Hilliard had never traveled to the Midwest before a summer
recruiting trip to South Bend, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   He noticed that the skies were different, sometimes more hazy
than the skies are in Texas. He liked the people around town
because they were similar to folks in the Fort Worth-Dallas area,
down to earth and friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Hilliard went back in the winter and experienced some snow and
bitter cold temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   That might take some getting used to.
</P>
<P>
   Hilliard plans to spend more time in Indiana, and he will sign a
national letter-of-intent Wednesday to play football for Notre
Dame.
</P>
<P>
   For the next four years, he will meet high school football
players from all over the country, and he will live in a place he's
never been. He will get to know the Midwest. Hilliard will learn
that people who live in small, farming communities actually enjoy
every minute of it.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, Hilliard is considered a traitor.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, my God. It can't be. He's about to leave Texas to play
football.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no yee-haws for Hilliard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking so forward to it,'' Hilliard said. ``I'm going
someplace completely different, and I enjoy experiencing places
I've never been before. I'd like to go to California and see things
out there, too. I've never been there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilliard is bringing down the percentages, and it's nice to see
he doesn't care.
</P>
<P>
   He is well aware that the big story in every Texas newspaper
this recruiting season is that a huge percentage of the state's
best football players are staying in Texas to play.
</P>
<P>
   The big story last year was that Texas players did not stay in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Big deal.
</P>
<P>
   All people cheer for are jerseys anyway, and it really doesn't
matter who is wearing them. Texas running back Ricky Williams is
from California. Those who follow the Longhorns don't like Williams
any less because he didn't grow up in Texas. Let me know the next
time you hear a fan yell: ``Hurray. We're national champions. Too
bad our players are from someplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   The hypocrisy of it would make for a good comedy skit.
</P>
<P>
   High school students are encouraged all through school to
experience different things. Go places and see the world. Football
players are urged to take all five of their recruiting visits so
they can see the country for free.
</P>
<P>
   Then, signing day comes.
</P>
<P>
   The ones who stay in Texas are heroes.
</P>
<P>
   The ones who don't are making a horrible decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``People never say things to your face, but you read stuff in
the papers about players leaving the state and how bad that is,''
Hilliard said. ``I look at it like this; those people don't know my
situation. I didn't want to stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilliard brings up an even more interesting point. Look down the
Texas Longhorns roster, and almost everybody is from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   How fun is that? You go off to college, and all your new friends
are exactly like you and all the friends you already had back
atLamar High School. Where Hilliard is going, there will be players
from everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Tell me who learns more _ Hilliard, or the guy who spends four
years in College Station?
</P>
<P>
   Hilliard should be applauded for leaving Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The skies might be a little more gray where he is going.
</P>
<P>
   But at least they're different.
</P>

DENVER HAILS THE BRONCOS AND SETS SIGHTS ON A THREE-PEAT
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DENVER _ In a celebration of two straight Super Bowl victories,
orange and blue plastic horse heads bobbed in a massive parade here
Monday, confirming that the Broncos, the sporty stallions of the
National Football League, have trampled Denver's fusty old image as
a cow town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the champions, we are the champions,'' sang a joyous
crowd, estimated at 375,000 people, that overflowed Civic Center
Park. Hoping to persuade the team's quarterback, John Elway, to
postpone retirement, some held up signs calling for a
``Three-peat'' and chanted, ``One more year, one more year.''
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback teased the crowd, ``That three-peat does sound
interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people had come from across the state for a glimpse of
their hero. ``God is coming,'' said Holly Smith, 38, who had driven
almost two hours from Colorado Springs to see the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday's festive scene contrasted with the hooliganism that
broke out Sunday night after Denver's 34-19 victory over the
Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl XXXIII. Repeating vandalism that was
seen after the Broncos' 1998 championship and after Denver's hockey
team, the Avalanche, won the Stanley Cup in 1996, bands of young
men ran through downtown, breaking windows, setting small fires,
throwing bottles at police, and fleeing tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like being behind the path of a tornado,'' Andrew
Hudson, spokesman for Mayor Wellington E. Webb, recalled Monday of
watching people run through the city's financial heart, 17th
Street. As part of an estimated $100,000 in damage, the vandals
broke windows on the street, sometimes called ``The Wall Street of
the Rockies.''
</P>
<P>
   Victory celebrations boiled over into minor vandalism in other
cities around the state: Boulder, Grand Junction, Greeley and Fort
Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, few Denverites interviewed had sympathy for the vandals.
``It's terrible, a lot of young kids out drinking too much,'' fumed
Daniel Munoz, a barber.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's parade went on without incident. But it came after many
Denverites felt jilted by the team's owner, Pat Bowlen. Last week,
the team announced that the Broncos would be too busy to have a
parade after a victory. Instead, fans would have to content
themselves with a rally. Only three months earlier, Denver area
voters had approved a pet proposal of Bowlen's: using sales tax
money to pay for three quarters of the $360 million cost of a new
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos officials said nine members of the team were required to
be in Hawaii for practice and publicity for next Sunday's Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Bowlen reversed himself and authorized a parade
featuring the entire team.
</P>
<P>
   The new stadium, which is to open in August 2001, is part of $1
billion in downtown investments, including a baseball stadium that
opened in 1995, and an aquarium that is to open in May.
</P>
<P>
   In this sports-oriented city, the Super Bowl victory carries
political weight, giving a lift to Webb, who plans to announce in
coming days that he will run for re-election. Without any strong
opponent in this heavily Democratic city, the mayor is favored to
win a third, four-year term in May.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl victory also comes as the Democratic National
Committee weighs Denver against Boston and Los Angeles for the 2000
Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is $130 million in spending by 50,000 delegates and
news people, as well as an enormous amount of news media exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the high road, Denver advocates say that by having their
convention here, Democrats would plant their flag in the Republican
Rockies and would link the Democratic Party with Denver's image of
high technology, efficiency and high living standards. Taking the
low road, advocates warn against holding the convention in Monica
S. Lewinsky's hometown (Los Angeles), and say that if the Democrats
cannot win Massachusetts next year, they are in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   With a decision expected within a few days, committee members
have said that they are impressed with Denver's smooth handling of
large events in the last five years: a papal visit, the Oklahoma
City bombing trials and a summit meeting of leaders of Russia and
the seven largest industrial nations.

ELWAY LEANING TOWARD ANOTHER SEASON? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The door, open just a sliver last week, is now wide
open. John Elway is considering whether to come back next season
and, his closest friends say, it is more a likelihood than a mere
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Elway did not sleep Sunday night after Denver's 34-19 Super Bowl
victory over Atlanta when, once again, he displayed the intangibles
that those few athletes who are great have, that gossamer that can
never be explained by words, when his 38-year-old body threw for
336 yards and one touchdown and ran for one more.
</P>
<P>
   He celebrated with his teammates and then with his coach, Mike
Shanahan, and when he arrived to accept his MVP trophy Monday at
8:30 in the morning, he said, ``I still haven't been able to lay
down and change the days yet; it's still Sunday to me.''
</P>
<P>
   And the memory of that Sunday just may be the deciding factor,
because Elway's arm seemed to have a magical revival Sunday night.
His passing in a playoff game hadn't been as crisp and sharp since
the famous game against Cleveland 12 years ago, the game of ``The
Drive'' that made Elway's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never felt as comfortable before a playoff or Super Bowl
game,'' Elway told friends before Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Even more significantly, Elway told intimates that the family
vote on his returning _ 4-1 against this time last year _ is now
3-2 against as one of his children apparently has switched sides.
But the deciding vote always is Elway's, and he has a chance to do
what no quarterback ever has done: win three Super Bowls in a row.
The enticement of that bid for immortality is compelling to Elway's
competitive nature, friends say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping he gives me one or two more years,'' Shanahan said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Elway would not rule out that possibility in his public comments
after accepting the MVP award. Indeed, those words hinted that his
mind is tilting toward returning.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 38 years old and in the twilight of my career, I really
have the tendency to focus on the `now' and not the `tomorrow,' ''
Elway began, using a variation of the stock reply he had given all
week. ``I really want to enjoy the win tonight. There'll be times
when I think about it down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, though, Elway said more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be great to come back and `three-peat,' '' he said,
``but also it would be nice to walk away with the way I'm playing
right now. It's a fine line because, as a football player, I'll
never want to never play football. It's such a fine line. I'm one
of those guys who doesn't want to walk away too late.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he went on, ``If I can play like I played tonight, then I
can play a little longer.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked why his arm seemed so much stronger and surer Sunday
night than it had earlier this season, Elway joked, ``I was talking
to Dan Marino the other night, and I said to Dan, `No wonder you
talk about playing three more years. You get down here in the sun
and practice and run around.'
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I enjoy practicing down here. It's tough to practice
in Denver when it's cold, but you get down here and the warmth kind
of seeps all the way down into your bones.''
</P>
<P>
   But the sheer artistry of Elway's performance against the
Falcons was due to more than the warmth of Florida. Elway earned
MVP honors in the ultimate game that leveled him three times in the
past, calling upon the intangibles that for so long have made him
great and have given him a new enticement to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to talk to my wife, who is my hero, and I'm going to
give my kids a vote, if they're in the house long enough,'' said
Elway. ``As I said earlier in the year, there's going to be no
absentee ballots this year. They're going to have to be home to
vote, and they never are. But there'll be no absentee ballots. I'll
talk to them and I talk to my dad and my mom and I'll talk to Mike
and I'll talk to (Broncos owner Pat Bowlen).''
</P>
<P>
   What Elway most fears is the unknown: how he'll react once he
decides to leave football. He also worries about what happens if
``I say I'm done and then get into April or May and say, `You know
what? I can play one more year.' So I just want to take the time
and not close the door.''
</P>
<P>
   The game itself Sunday night displayed the dilemma Elway is in.
Shanahan joked that Elway's TD on his trademark quarterback draw
play was a more difficult score than it had been in the past. And
there was another play on a keeper around the right side when Elway
and Atlanta linebacker Cornelius Bennett were in a foot race, a
race Elway easily would have won years ago for a huge gain, but
this time resulted in no gain. Elway clearly is 38 years old.
</P>
<P>
   But Elway's passing was magnificent. The Falcons dared him to
beat them with his arm and his leadership, and Elway was immense.
He still has that intangible gift that few QBs have. As he put it
last week when talking about all-time great QBs, ``They find a way
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   If he were to take out a yellow legal pad and draw a line down
the middle, the ``pros'' for his return on one side would be these,
he said: ``No. 1 would be talking about `three-peat,' and No. 2
would be my need to compete. And then on the other side, it would
be whether physically I can still do it. And whether you can still
spend the time to prepare, especially what we do in Denver
offensively, spend the time mentally each week to get ready.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, Elway tapped his chest and said, ``It'll
depend on what I feel here. The bottom line is my heart is going to
tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   And his heart, his friends say, is leaning toward returning.

   WASHINGTON _ For the second year running, President Clinton is
trying to block Republicans from enacting a broad tax cut. And yet
the budget Clinton released Monday includes a variety of ``targeted
tax relief'' for certain groups, ranging from parents of infants to
parkland advocates to the steel industry.
</P>
<P>
   While closing ``tax shelters'' for corporations, Clinton would
create at least a dozen new tax breaks for families, for certain
businesses, and for state and local taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The large number of tax breaks _ the White House leaked word of
them earlier this month at a rate of one a day _ has raised a
debate about whether the nation is better off giving everyone a tax
cut, or funneling the benefit to certain groups who might deserve
an extra hand.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say a rollback in income tax rates of 10 percent or
15 percent is fairest to the most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, ``we did a lot of targeted tax cuts, and if you
weren't a left-handed cab driver in New York, you didn't get
anything,'' Representative John Kasich, an Ohio Republican who
leads the House Budget Committee, said Monday. ``You know, there
were a lot of Americans left out.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, a senior White House economic adviser, counters
that narrow tax credits are the most fair. A family earning
$40,000, he said, might save only $100 or $200 under the Republican
income tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Clinton foresees a benefit of several times that
amount for the same family through the ``United Savings Accounts''
he proposed this month. The so-called USA accounts would give
families an annual payment and matching grants to help them save
for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're proposing is far more progressive, more targeted to
middle-income families,'' Sperling said. The White House has not
released details of the savings account proposal yet and has not
said what income caps would apply.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and its critics also differ on
whether broad tax cuts or narrow tax breaks are more beneficial to
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has long argued that the nation needs to cut its debts
while making selective ``investments'' in programs that make people
more productive. The administration uses that argument when arguing
for higher spending on education and worker training.
</P>
<P>
   But conservative economists say that Clinton's tax credits make
the economy less efficient by using the tax code to change people's
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Even something like Clinton's ``Hope credit'' for college
tuition, which is now law, makes the economy less efficient, argues
Diana Furchtgott-Roth, a tax economist with the American Enterprise
Institute, a conservative think tank. ``Some people might not want
education,'' she said. ``They might want to do something else that
is equally productive, like start a small business. But the tax
code says, `Go to school.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, she said, conservative philosophy calls for the
government, when faced with surplus tax money, to return it to
taxpayers with no strings attached. ``They shouldn't say, `We'll
give money back if you jump through this hoop. You can't take your
money and go fishing. You have to go to school or have children.
Plus, you can't earn more than a certain income to get it back,''
Furchtgott-Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's USA plan would cost $536 billion over 15 years. Other
tax credits in his budget include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A $1,000 credit for services for people who need long-term
health care, at a cost of $5.6 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   _ A $1,000 credit to help the disabled pay for transportation,
special technology and other on-the-job costs. The price is $700
million over five years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tax credits to help local governments issue nearly $25 billion
in bonds to build or renovate public schools.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tax credits to help state and local governments issue $9.5
billion in bonds to preserve green space, create urban parks or
protect water quality.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tax credits for stay-at-home parents with a child under age 1,
for small employers who offer health insurance and for the US steel
industry.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an effort to stay as up-to-the-minute as its name,
the 70-year-old Museum of Modern Art has reached an agreement to
merge with the small, cutting-edge P.S. 1 Center for Contemporary
Art in Long Island City, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The merger is a marriage between resources and innovation. It
will give the Modern a far greater involvement with art of the
moment, which it has long been accused of slighting in favor of the
earlier movements it helped place in the 20th-century canon. It
will also give the Manhattan-based museum a presence in another
borough, help it reach a younger audience, and give it access to
new exhibition space at a time when it will have to shut down parts
of its building on West 53rd Street during a major expansion.
</P>
<P>
   For P.S. 1, the 28-year-old showcase for contemporary work that
has helped attract a number of artists to its neighborhood, the
union will provide access to the Modern's vast collection and deep
pockets and to marketing resources that will likely boost its
visibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunities are unprecedented,'' said Glenn Lowry,
director of the Modern, adding that the future of his museum ``lies
in its commitment to contemporary art.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal also promises to be a boost for working-class Long
Island City, where the Modern is also buying a nearby building for
storage, offices and workshops. Despite their strikingly different
pedigrees and settings _ the Modern's on 53rd Street off Fifth
Avenue and P.S. 1's on Jackson Avenue, four blocks from the
Queens-Midtown Tunnel _ the two institutions are only 10 minutes or
two subway stops apart on the E and F trains.
</P>
<P>
   The city, which owns the P.S. 1 building, endorsed the merger,
which was praised Monday by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. The Romanesque
Revival building was a public school that was closed by the Board
of Education in 1976. The center has been in its present home for
more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   While the two institutions say they will maintain their artistic
independence, they are considering changing P.S. 1's name to MOMA
P.S. 1. (Several other ideas have been bandied about, including,
perhaps in jest, calling P.S. 1 the Ultra Modern.) The two
institutions will integrate their development, education,
marketing, financial planning and membership departments.
</P>
<P>
   Just how much financial support the Modern plans to invest in
P.S. 1 is unclear, in part because the details of the merger will
be ironed out over the next 60 days. While one trustee estimated
that the Modern's direct investment would not be more than about
$100,000 a year, its greater aid will likely come in fund-raising
help and cross-marketing efforts in which, for example, both
museums can be featured in joint mailings.
</P>
<P>
   Alanna Heiss, P.S. 1's founding director, will remain its head,
but she will report to Lowry. Ms. Heiss will also become a deputy
director of the Modern. Meanwhile, Lowry said, several members of
the Modern's board will serve on P.S. 1's board. He likened the
relationship to one between a university and one of its constituent
schools.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Heiss said that concern about her center's long-run
prospects following a successful $8.5 million renovation two years
ago led her to think of a merger. ``I started worrying about our
stability long-term,'' she said. ``We've always been able to borrow
works when we need them. But to have access to MOMA's collection
and its curatorial expertise is a tremendous resource for us.'' The
financial support will also be important, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Modern, which was founded in 1929 by Abby Aldrich
Rockefeller, wife of the financier John D. Rockefeller Jr.; Mary
Quinn Sullivan, and Lillie Bliss, attracts more than 1.6 million
visitors a year. It has an endowment of about $300 million, a
world-class collection of more than 100,000 works of contemporary
and modern art and objects, and a reputation for organizing
blockbuster exhibitions of legendary artists like Picasso, Bonnard
and Pollock.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is also poised for its biggest expansion. Three years
ago it bought the neighboring Dorset Hotel and two adjacent
brownstones with the intention of doubling its total space and
including flexible galleries for showing contemporary art,
something it has lacked. The P.S. 1 space could be used for the
Modern's shows when parts of the museum are closed during
construction, which is scheduled to begin in early 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In November MOMA announced that it had begun a $650 million
capital campaign; more than half of that has been raised. It is
believed to be the largest fund-raising effort by any museum in the
country and possibly by any American cultural institution. P.S. 1,
on the other hand, has 150,000 square feet of exhibition space, an
annual attendance of just over 100,000 visitors, and no permanent
collection aside from several installation works, including James
Terrell's ``Meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is an international magnet for contemporary art, with its
generous sculpture court and shows in the last year of artists like
John Coplans, Jack Smith and Jackie Winsor, who are well known in
the art world but little-known to the public. The center's
reopening and many of its shows _ it had 68 last year _ draw
thousands of people from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Lowry said the idea for the merger began last fall when he
started talking to Ms. Heiss about collaborating on possible
projects. P.S. 1 appealed to him because of Long Island City's
proximity to the Modern without being in Manhattan. Combined with
the warehouse building the museum is buying in the neighborhood,
Lowry said, ``We are creating a cultural corridor through the
subway,'' citing other Queens institutions, like the Isamu Noguchi
Garden Museum in Long Island City and the American Museum of the
Moving Image in Astoria.
</P>
<P>
   ``P.S. 1 is a major institution in its own right,'' said Claire
Shulman, the Queens borough president. ``It will now become a
major, major institution bringing a kind of sophistication we
welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   As owner of the P.S. 1 building, the city paid 85 percent of its
renovation costs, with the rest coming from private donors. The
city also contributes one-third to one-half of P.S. 1's total
annual operating budget of $1.5 million to $2 million, and it will
continue to do so. Schuyler Chapin, the New York City commissioner
of cultural affairs, said the city also planned to help P.S. 1
complete some work that still needed to be done, such as repairs to
windows.
</P>
<P>
   In forging this new link, the Modern is in some ways following
the lead of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, which has had a
branch in SoHo for seven years and is exploring the possibility of
building a new museum along the Hudson River in the West Village.

ANALYSIS: CONSENSUS ON SAVING SOCIAL SECURITY BUT NOT ON HOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Minn., N.J., N.M.)  (See related BUDGET-CLINTON, BUDGET-SPEND, BUDGET-REVENUE) 
 (sw) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It says ``Budget of the United States Government''
on the cover, but the document that President Clinton sent to
Congress on Monday is really a political agenda, in spreadsheet
form, for a new fiscal era.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents always use their budget proposals to lay out their
wish lists, and Clinton has been particularly adept at using the
annual budget cycle not just to win attention for new and recycled
programs but, this year especially, to portray himself as active
and engaged.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton also has a more sweeping goal. With Washington still
in shock at the speed with which the federal government has left
behind an era of huge budget deficits and diminished expectations,
Clinton is trying to seize the high ground in a fast-developing and
fundamental debate over how the nation should capitalize on its
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Should the country invest its anticipated fiscal windfall in
preparing for the aging of the baby boom generation and the strains
that will create on the foundations of the social welfare system,
Social Security and Medicare? In Clinton's view, that is the
prudent course and one that, after accounting for new spending for
the Pentagon and domestic priorities, leaves no money for the
sweeping tax cuts that frustrated Republicans have been demanding
for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just about saving Social Security and Medicare,
although that is terribly important,'' Clinton said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscal prudence now, he said, will allow succeeding generations
to deal with the unforeseen and unknowable challenges of the next
century ``unburdened by the unfinished business of the 20th
century, unshackled by our profligacy in the latter part of this
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clinton's implications to the contrary, Republicans say,
they are equally dedicated to shoring up Social Security, and they
also believe there should be more money for education and the
military. Showing remarkable unanimity for a party that has been
riven for the last few years by internal dissent, Republicans are
arguing that there is enough money to slash taxes as well, although
the budgetary math that leads to such a conclusion is a bit murky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can have it all,'' said Rep. John R. Kasich, R-Ohio, who is
chairman of the House Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The two parties are in at least tacit agreement on a few points.
One is not to question too aggressively the assumption that the
trillions of dollars in anticipated surpluses will actually
materialize. Reaping the windfall requires that the economy and the
stock market remain relatively healthy for years. And Republicans
and Democrats alike are considering detailed policy proposals that
presume long-term budget forecasts from the White House and
Congress prove uncharacteristically accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the two parties are not far apart on the biggest
question before them. Facing the insolvency of what is arguably the
most popular and enduring of all government programs, they agree in
general terms that nearly two-thirds of the anticipated budget
surpluses should go to dealing with Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   There is little agreement, however, on the best way of using the
surplus to shore up the retirement system. And even putting aside
Social Security, there is a heated battle shaping up over how to
use the money left over once Social Security's future is assured.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leadership in Congress and Clinton have powerful
reasons to find some accommodation this year and enact legislation
on Social Security and dividing up the surplus. But the stakes are
so big and the atmosphere so poisonous that resolution of the big
questions may have to wait for the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   And even as they debate each other, the two parties are being
forced to rethink their own approaches to tax and spending policy
as the old rules forged in the austerity of deficit politics give
way to a presumed age of fiscal plenty. They even need a new
language.
</P>
<P>
   So murky are some of the concepts for using the surplus to shore
up Social Security that neither side can fully understand what the
other is proposing, leaving budget analysts from both parties
scratching their heads. And what, after all, has happened to the
deficit hawk now that the deficit is no more?
</P>
<P>
   No longer able to use the specter of endless deficits to impose
limits on the growth and power of the federal government,
Republicans are returning to the approach championed by Ronald
Reagan two decades ago: stimulate the economy through big tax cuts,
an approach that has the corollary benefit of starving the
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We count on the American people to handle their own money and
solve many of their own problems around their kitchen tables and
their front rooms and their businesses,'' said Sen. Pete V.
Domenici, R-N.M., who is the chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee. ``We don't want to invent programs to use the surplus
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Having tried hard to refashion themselves as the party of fiscal
responsibility, the Democrats now have to find a way to promote
what Clinton called on Monday a ``prudent but progressive''
approach to governing. In other words, can they use government to
address the country's problems without opening the floodgates to
new spending?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a budget and an agenda that will not do nearly enough
to bridge the broad and growing chasm that divides the wealthy and
prosperous from the majority of Americans,'' said Sen. Paul
Wellstone, D-Minn., who added that the country has ``a great number
of critical domestic programs that desperately require real
budgetary commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was a sign of the Democratic Party's move to center on
fiscal issues that his critique was an isolated one and that the
official party line of the day was that Democrats stood for a
smaller, smarter government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cry has gone out across this country, `The Democrats are
at it again, the era of big government,''' said Sen. Frank
Lautenberg of New Jersey, the senior Democrat on the Senate Budget
Committee. ``The fact of the matter is that we will be spending
less as a percentage of the American economy on government than we
have at any time since 1973, and that public debt, looking out 15
years from now, will be at its lowest point since 1917.''

<P>
   Acting city editor Peter Canellos will become assistant managing
editor for metropolitan news, leading a list of reassignments that
Storin said was aimed at introducing ``fresh blood and fresh
ideas'' to the newspaper. The changes take effect March 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was time to reinvigorate the place,'' Storin told a crowded
staff meeting. ``No one was taken out of a job because they were
doing a bad job.''
</P>
<P>
   Storin said the news staff was performing well but needed to
prepare for new challenges, especially the Globe's efforts to
reverse a decline in circulation.
</P>
<P>
   The other changes are as follows:
</P>
<P>
   Assistant city editor Joe Williams, 36, will move up to city
editor, filling the job left open by the promotion of Canellos,
also 36. Teresa Hanafin, 43, currently assistant managing editor
for metro news, will become assistant managing editor for
technology, a newly created position.
</P>
<P>
   Political editor Doug Bailey, 45, was named senior assistant
metropolitan editor for health and science. He will succeed Nils
Bruzelius, 52, who will become foreign editor. The current foreign
editor, Sam Allis, 52, will move to a reporting job.
</P>
<P>
   Business editor Larry Edelman, 37, will replace Bailey as
political editor. Peter Mancusi, 44, senior assistant business
editor, takes over as business editor; Bennie DiNardo, 41, an
assistant magazine editor, becomes senior assistant business
editor.
</P>
<P>
   Living editor Nick King, 52, was appointed editor of the Sunday
magazine. Fiona Luis, 34, an assistant living editor, will assume
King's position. Evelynne Kramer, 55, the magazine editor, will
take a senior editing job still under discussion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Storin said two of his immediate lieutenants,
managing editor Gregory Moore and executive editor Helen Donovan,
will shift responsibilities. Donovan, 51, now in charge of the
daily Globe, will oversee the Sunday paper. In the case of Moore,
44, Storin said the change would provide ``a great opportunity for
Greg to operate more on his own day to day.''
</P>
<P>
   While the moves appeared to be steps down for some of the
affected editors, Storin said he did not believe that ``anybody
involved with these changes is unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   Storin, a Globe veteran who has been editor for six years, said
in response to a question that he could not recall a reshuffling of
management jobs in the newsroom involving more people.
</P>
<P>
   Also in response to a question, Storin said the impetus for the
changes did not come from the resignations of former Globe
columnists Patricia Smith or Mike Barnicle, at least not directly.
He said the only possible link was that last summer's turmoil may
have left a ``subliminal'' sense that it was ``time to move
forward.'' The Globe asked for Smith's resignation last June after
she admitted fabricating parts of columns. Two months later,
Barnicle resigned after he was unable to substantiate facts in a
column.
</P>
<P>
   Erosion in the Globe's Sunday circulation, which dropped 1
percent over the six months that ended last Sept. 30, is an
industry-wide problem related to changing lifestyles, according to
Storin. In the Globe's case, a price increase also contributed to
the falloff, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Summarizing the reason for the changes, Storin said: ``If you
put good people in good positions, good things are going to happen.
That's the underlying philosophy here.''

U.S. FORCES A MICROSOFT DEFENSE TO BACKFIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. set out in federal court Monday
morning to demonstrate that computer users gain numerous benefits
from the company's decision to integrate a Web browser with the
Windows operating system, but by the afternoon the demonstration
appeared to have backfired.
</P>
<P>
   On cross-examination, James Allchin, a senior Microsoft
executive, readily acknowledged that nearly all of the same
benefits would be available to users who bought a version of
Windows with no browser included _ and later installed Microsoft's
browser separately.
</P>
<P>
   For the government the acknowledgment seemed a landmark in the
trial, since the foundation of Microsoft's defense rests on the
assertion that Windows and Internet Explorer are one inseparable
product.
</P>
<P>
   The government argues that Microsoft illegally tied the two
together as a means of disadvantaging a competitor, Netscape
Communications Corp., while Microsoft says the integration was
simply a natural evolutionary step for computer operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   David Boies, the government's lead lawyer, clearly jubilant
outside the courtroom Monday evening, said: ``What we demonstrated
today is that you don't have to weld the two together to get these
benefits. You get exactly the same experience by combining two
products, if that is what the customer wants, but the customer gets
a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Microsoft had a different take.
</P>
<P>
   ``Point by point, we demonstrated the facts that the Court of
Appeals found when it ruled in our favor last year,'' said Mark
Murray, a Microsoft spokesman. ``And that is that consumers reap
major benefits that cannot be achieved by simply adding Netscape on
top of the operating system.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruling in a separate but related case last June, a three-judge
panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit said Microsoft had the right to determine what features and
functions to include in its operating system _ as long as the
combination ``offers advantages unavailable'' if a consumer
purchased separate software products and combined them to achieve
similar capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Boies said Monday that he showed that Microsoft could meet the
court's test by selling Windows and the browser separately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is no benefit that we did not debunk today,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Allchin, a senior vice president in charge of the
technical development of the company's Windows operating system,
took the stand Monday morning, Microsoft played several hours of
videotaped demonstrations that Allchin had prepared. They carefully
laid out the benefits that users gain from the inclusion of Web
browsing software in Windows 98, hewing closely to the test that
had been laid out in the Court of Appeals decision.
</P>
<P>
   Among these advantages are the ability to look through files on
the computer's hard drive and Internet Web pages, using the same
software window, as well as the ability to call up Web pages from
numerous places in Windows and display them as background on the
computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   These and other benefits are ``capabilities that are only
available through the deep integration of Internet technologies
into the Windows operating system,'' one of the presenters on the
videotape said. Among them, he noted, is one that allows users to
get help online, while users of older systems might have to ``dig
up documentation from the pile in the back of the closet.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the tapes had ended and Boies began cross-examining
Allchin, he asked whether Microsoft offered its Web browser
separately to people still using older versions of Windows 95 that
did not come with the browser included. Yes, Allchin said, and by
loading this separate software package, ``it becomes almost Windows
98.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Boies led Allchin back through his videotape, asking him
point by point, 19 times, whether each benefit of integration could
be obtained by buying Windows 95 with no browser installed, then
separately acquiring the browser software and loading it on top.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Allchin acknowledged each time. ``But you are playing
semantic word games here,'' he said. ``You are replacing core
operating system files when you do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies then asked: ``But it is entirely practical to deliver
these two pieces of functionality separately, isn't it? All you're
doing is offering a competitive product, and some consumers would
choose it and some consumers would not.''
</P>
<P>
   Allchin did not get a chance to respond directly. But through
the questions, he did doggedly maintain that ``all you are doing is
taking two pieces of Windows and putting them together.''

IOC TO ALLOW OUTSIDERS TO OVERSEE ACTIVITIES
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By PAUL MONTGOMERY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ The International Olympic Committee is
near completion of an ethics panel that for the first time will
allow outsiders a role in overseeing its activities.
</P>
<P>
   Francois Carrard, a Swiss lawyer who serves as the committee's
executive director, said Monday that the concept of an independent
panel composed of two IOC members and three outsiders had won
approval from the IOC's 11-member executive board after a meeting
Monday morning. He would say nothing about the proposed non-IOC
members except to describe them as ``very senior independent
personalities'' of worldwide renown and with ``impeccable
credentials.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrard, who has frequently been brought forward for damage
control in the IOC's burgeoning ethics crisis, spoke at a news
conference on the eve of a three-day international meeting here on
doping in sports. The meeting was planned before the outbreak in
November of the bribery scandal involving the 2002 Winter Olympics
in Salt Lake City, a scandal that has since spread to include other
cities that allegedly paid bribes or gave favors to IOC members in
an effort to attract the Olympics. In the last months, ethics
questions have overshadowed doping questions at the lakeside
quarters of the IOC here.
</P>
<P>
   Carrard said the ethics panel and its proposed members would be
submitted for approval to the full IOC, now down to 106 voting
members from 118 a year ago. Three members have died, four have
resigned as a result of accusations of corruption and five have
been suspended pending expulsion by a plenary session next month.
</P>
<P>
   The doping congress, which brings together 650 delegates from
government and sports, is intended to forge new enforcement
mechanisms for world athletics. Spurred by a series of doping
scandals that enveloped the Tour de France cycling race last
summer, the congress is the largest held so far. The doping problem
in sports has, by wide agreement, so far defeated efforts at
control, but in advance statements, participants here still hold
out hope.
</P>
<P>
   One major proposal involves the creation of a worldwide
independent doping control agency that would establish enforcement
standards to keep pace with the inventions of new drugs. Juan
Antonio Samaranch, the 78-year-old president of the IOC, has said
he would like an agency headed by an IOC executive, possibly Prince
Alexandre de Merode, a Belgian who has led the IOC medical
commission since its inception 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including Barry R. McCaffrey, director of the White
House Office of National Drug Control Policy, say the IOC lacks the
credibility to effectively run the agency. They say it should be
completely separate, with open books, open finances and democratic
votes.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey will attend the conference as part of the U.S.
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Another proposal under consideration is for urine and blood
samples taken from athletes in competition to be frozen for future
testing when detection techniques are more advanced. That, too, is
controversial.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC is also at odds with the international federations for
soccer, cycling and tennis about suspension of athletes detected
taking drugs. The IOC has proposed suspension from competition for
two years for the first offense, and for life for the second.
Soccer and cycling say that two years is too much for participants
in their sports, since a professional's career is 15 years or so,
whereas other Olympic sports allow more time to recoup lost years.
</P>
<P>
   In all the debate, which goes on until the adoption of a final
declaration on Thursday, the shaky position of the IOC at the
center of world sports is likely to be the main issue. When the
conference was planned last year, the IOC was alone in the field,
but the bribery scandals have undermined its position.

FOR ELWAY AND SHANAHAN, A VICTORY MADE IN PICTURES
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It was a blue loose-leaf notebook in the hands of Mike
Shanahan early in Super Bowl XXXIII that, in part, became the key
to unlocking the Atlanta defense in Denver's 34-19 championship
victory here on Sunday. It was a book of pictures, snapshots of the
Atlanta defensive sets early in the game.
</P>
<P>
   There on the Broncos bench after Denver's initial offensive
drives sat Shanahan, the Denver head coach, and to his right,
quarterback John Elway. Huddling. Studying. Both flipping the pages
back and forth. Elway would point in the book and Shanahan would,
too, and there was give and take between them and nodding and
nudging.
</P>
<P>
   These two guys were in school, in their own karma, in sync,
privately but so publicly working and relating smack in the middle
of Super Bowl XXXIII. There was clamoring in the stands surrounding
them and clashing on the field in front of them, but little
appeared to matter to both on the Broncos bench as they intensely
brainstormed during the game while the Denver defense performed on
the field.
</P>
<P>
   Every team reviews photos of opposing defense during games, but
this scene represented something special. There was more than a
decade of familiarity between Shanahan and Elway at work, a span
that has born mutual respect and sharpened talents and genuine
growth. The kind of relationship where one man can look the other
squarely in the eye and see his own reflection.
</P>
<P>
   Get the picture?
</P>
<P>
   ``That book had our first 15 or so plays in it and a look at
their defensive sets in response,'' Shanahan explained. ``On the
left side were pictures of a play before the snap; on the right
side were pictures of the same play one-and-a-half seconds after
the snap. So, add it up and you've got 30 or so pictures. We called
two or three plays early with some very unusual formations to see
how Atlanta would react. From that we could tell in the pictures
that the safeties were really biting on the run and on action in
front of them. That told us enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, the 80-yard touchdown pass to Rod Smith was not in the
game plan. We put that pattern in where he would run at and then by
the safety after we read the pictures. You never know the way the
game is going to go. But it's nice to have a quarterback like John
where you expect him to pick things up, that little has to be
repeated. In our conversation over there on the bench during that
time, I didn't ask him what does he think about this or that.
That's my job. My job is to think, to come up with the adjustments
and not to overload him. His job is to play quarterback and I try
and keep his mind free to do that. But he knows what is going on in
the book and on the field. He knows how to look people off with his
passes and play with a commanding presence. I really thought that
John or Shannon Sharpe would be the MVP in the game. John earned
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach and quarterback. A signature duo on any Super Bowl
champion team. We have seen Lombardi and Starr. Namath and Eubanks.
Shula and Griese. Knoll and Bradshaw. Gibbs and Williams. Walsh and
Montana. All Super Bowl-winning head coach/quarterback duos. Maybe
only Walsh and Montana of the San Francisco 49ers match the
chemistry, respect and modern-day offensive artistry of Shanahan
and Elway.
</P>
<P>
   In other ways, this is a duo whose personal relationship stands
alone in Super Bowl history.
</P>
<P>
   Get the picture?
</P>
<P>
   ``You never really know what is behind some of those
relationships in past Super Bowls and what the people involved
really think about each other,'' Shanahan said. ``It can be
personal or it can be strictly business; the people involved are
really the only ones who know.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first met John I was 31 and he was 24. I was the new
assistant coach in Denver and he was the new quarterback and we
sort of started our careers together. We studied film and grew
together. Now, I was in San Francisco for three years later in my
career and Steve Young is one of the classiest people you will ever
meet, but we didn't bond like that. John was hungry and wanted to
be the best and he was not happy because he wanted to win the Super
Bowl. The tag had already been put on him that he was the best and
he should win at least one. But the biggest problem was he never
had a run game and nor a power running game and nor a defense that
could stop the run. That means everything to winning a Super
Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   So does the supporting cast.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two years Elway has been complemented by running
back Terrell Davis; by big, tall dangerous receivers who are easy
targets with sure hands; by an offensive line that has been
exacting, and by a defense that is unsung but, in every way, has
proved its mettle as special, tough and impacting. Elway has been
complemented by an owner in Pat Bowlen who has stroked him, who
understood Elway's ability and stature and cultivated it, creating
an environment where the Broncos would always look forward,
stretching for new heights rather than leveling at a common
plateau.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, Elway gained Shanahan. He coached Elway as an
assistant from 1984 through 1987 and then again from 1989 through
1991. And then in 1995 Shanahan returned to Denver as head coach,
and put himself in charge of nearly every Bronco detail ranging
from personnel to plays and beyond. He picked the Denver roster
apart, pulling here, tugging there. He set new standards. He
created new, imaginative offensive designs and placed a supporting
staff of coaches around himself and of players around Elway that
would boost Denver to a record of 55-18 in all games under Shanahan
in the last three seasons. That would boost Denver to consecutive
Super Bowl titles.
</P>
<P>
   They have done it together, Shanahan and Elway, with their
families involved and with their egos between them in check and
with love abounding between them. And now it may be over. Elway has
hinted that he will retire after 16 pro seasons, though he said
here on Monday that he has not closed the door, that he could,
indeed, return for another season.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan was asked if he could entice Elway into coming back by
promising him that he could sit out five or so games and simply
rest, or by promising he could sit out more practices, more routine
drills?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I couldn't do that to the team and John wouldn't,
either,'' Shanahan said. ``He's too smart for that. He knows and I
know that is not the way to win a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Get the picture?
</P>
<P>
   The kind of relationship where one man can look the other
squarely in the eye and see his own reflection.

WOMEN ARE URGED TO `TAKE CARE OF YOUR OWN BUSINESS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RUSS WILES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Many women don't know enough about financial matters
to trust their own judgments, unfairly blame men for their own
money woes and spend a lot more time on their appearances than
their portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's how some female financial experts see it.
</P>
<P>
   Proving that stereotypes don't die easily, even in a politically
correct age, female financial experts continue to play up what they
describe as noticeable differences between the sexes when it comes
to money matters _ all in the hopes of inspiring their sisters to a
greater degree of confidence and control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men grow up figuring they'll have a wife and kids that they'll
have to take care of,'' said Tessa Albert Warschaw, a
psychotherapist and financial author. ``With women, there's still
an expectation that someone will give it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The objectives of men and women may be pretty much the same _
save sufficiently and generate enough investment profits to live
comfortably and enjoy security heading into old age.
</P>
<P>
   Yet women apparently use different means _ and not altogether
successful ones _ to achieve those ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference comes in the fact that women, more than men,
have not been socialized to talk about money,'' said Laura Wolf,
managing director at Smith Barney Asset Management in New York.
``Women want to be educated about investing, but too often we're
afraid even to ask the questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Warschaw, Wolf and other female money experts drove home the
message of self-reliance during a talk last week in Phoenix that
drew more than 250 people, mostly women.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times do you sign a paper without reading it?''
Warschaw asked the crowd. ``Don't blame him if you don't take care
of your own business.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than challenge such statements, many spectators agreed
with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel women have been left out (of family financial
decisions) by men who want to protect them,'' said Marge Lazarus of
Scottsdale. ``But I also think some women want to be left out.''
</P>
<P>
   Penny Wolford of Scottsdale said she regularly sees friends
facing financial disruptions when they divorce or separate because
they didn't take the time to educate themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not prepared when the time comes, it can be a
shock,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Money as a source of security was a dominant theme at the
seminar, which was sponsored by brokerage Salomon Smith Barney and
focused on divorce and widowhood. Almost everyone in the audience
who posed a question asked about such things as estate planning,
insurance or starting an investment plan. Nobody asked about
options, gold, hot mutual funds, day trading or Internet stocks _
likely fodder for a male-dominated crowd.
</P>
<P>
   To Wolford, that was an indication women can make better
investors than men _ a contention with which many financial experts
agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men have a greater tendency to trade, they're too impatient
and they don't do as much research as they should,'' said Wolford,
who belongs to a Valley investment club. ``I know my husband and I
don't see eye to eye on investing.''
</P>
<P>
   The panelists, who also included attorney Jacalyn Barnett and
Michele Williams, a vice president in Citibank's estate-planning
and trust division, steered the audience toward a fairly banal list
of financial recommendations:
</P>
<P>
   _ Make sure you know what you own and what you owe.
</P>
<P>
   _ Find out who's managing your investments.
</P>
<P>
   _ Size up your spouse's Social Security and retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   _ Develop a habit of saving.
</P>
<P>
   _ Draw up an estate plan and amend it periodically.

MONICA LEWINSKY IS QUESTIONED BY HOUSE PROSECUTORS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALISON MITCHELL and DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to bolster an obstruction-of-justice charge
against President Clinton, a House Republican prosector interviewed
Monica Lewinsky under oath and on videotape for nearly four hours
on Monday. White House lawyers offered only an apology to the young
woman and made no inquiries of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The questioning of Ms. Lewinsky in the 10th floor Presidential
Suite of the Mayflower Hotel marked a new and possibly final phase
in the Senate's impeachment trial, which stemmed from Clinton's
efforts to cover up his sexual relationship with the former White
House intern. Six senators sat in, and one of them, Mike DeWine, an
Ohio Republican, presided.
</P>
<P>
   One year after the scandal seized Washington, Ms. Lewinsky once
again received a statement of regret for the disruption to her life
and to her family. Several officials familiar with the session said
that the lawyers representing the president asked her no questions.
Instead, one of them, Nicole K. Seligman, read her an apology on
behalf of the president for her ordeal across a year of
investigations. The president first apologized to Ms. Lewinsky
shortly after he publicly admitted to the relationship last August.
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings began at 9:03 a.m. and ended at 3:14, with
several breaks, including an hour for lunch. The actual questioning
took far less time than the eight hours that had been allotted by
the Senate. Rep. Ed Bryant, a Tennessee Republican, who conducted
the interview for the House prosecutors, said in a written
statement, ``I was pleased with today's events and felt it was a
productive session.''
</P>
<P>
   But the White House's decision not to use its four hours for
questioning suggested that the lawyers felt no startling new
information had emerged as Ms. Lewinsky told her story once again.
The House focused on her affidavit in the Paula Corbin Jones
lawsuit, denying a sexual relationship with Clinton; on the help
Vernon E. Jordan Jr. gave her in seeking a job, and on the
retrieval of gifts from the president by Clinton's secretary, Betty
Currie.
</P>
<P>
   Plato Cacheris, Ms. Lewinsky's lawyer, said Monday night, ``She
was excused as a witness, and that was it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the senators emerged from the hotel about 3:30, they
emphasized their chamber's efforts to keep the deposition process
secret. ``We are under a prohibition from the United States Senate
not to talk any further about this,'' DeWine said.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant canceled appearances he had scheduled for Monday night on
``Larry King Live'' and on ``Crossfire.'' ``We set them up because
it seemed like he could possibly talk about the deposition
afterwards,'' said Steve Susens, his spokesman. ``Somewhere down
the line he decided against it.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators will be allowed to view the videotape of the
questioning on Tuesday, even as the House and White House lawyers
question a second witness, Jordan, about his efforts to help Ms.
Lewinsky find a job. A less sensational presence than Ms. Lewinsky,
Jordan, a Washington lawyer close to Clinton, is to be questioned
on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate was arranging for three group showings of Ms.
Lewinsky's videotaped deposition in three large rooms in the
Capitol, and individual senators can see the tape in a separate
recording room. Senators will also be able to read her deposition.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday a third witness, Sidney Blumenthal, a senior White
House aide, is to be questioned about the president's remarks to
him that he had been stalked by Ms. Lewinsky. The next day, the
Senate trial is to resume. Senators will then vote on whether to
allow the videotaped depositions to be shown as part of the trial
and on whether to call the witnesses themselves for questioning
before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Although House prosecutors once wanted to call as many as 15
witnesses, they narrowed their list to three under pressure from
Senate Republicans, who were eager to bring the case to a close.
The House prosecutors want to use Ms. Lewinsky, Jordan and
Blumenthal to bolster one article of impeachment in particular;
that article charges Clinton with obstructing justice in his
efforts to hide the affair. A number of senators have said they
take this charge more seriously than a second one, which charges
Clinton with perjury.
</P>
<P>
   A battery of lawyers, lawmakers and aides attended the
questioning of Ms. Lewinsky on Monday. Officials familiar with the
session, who spoke on condition that they not be identified,
described Ms. Lewinsky as poised, even occasionaly humorous,
throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said Bryant, a former prosecutor, covered several
areas that have been of interest to the team of House managers.
They said that he asked Ms. Lewinsky to run through the events
leading to her delivery of some of the president's gifts to Ms.
Currie and that Ms. Lewinsky stuck to her prior testimony that it
was Ms. Currie who had initiated the collection of the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Byrant, the officials said, also quizzed her about the time Ms.
Currie picked up the gifts and about a cell phone call by Ms.
Currie to Ms. Lewinsky's apartment that the White House has argued
undercuts Ms. Lewinsky because it came an hour and a half after Ms.
Lewinsky said Ms. Currie had picked up the gifts. Ms. Lewinsky,
officials said, said her memory had become more hazy over time.
</P>
<P>
   At other moments in the questioning, Ms. Lewinsky pointed the
House prosecutor back to her statements before the grand jury,
officials said, such as when Bryant asked whether Jordan had ever
said he was acting on behalf of the president as he was helping her
seek a job in New York. Ms. Lewinsky had told the grand jury that
Jordan never made such a claim.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant asked her why she had filed a false affidavit in the
sexual harassment suit brought by Ms. Jones against Clitnon. One
person familiar with the testimony said Ms. Lewisnky repeated her
statement that the president never instructed her to lie.
</P>
<P>
   With the Senate worried about a spectacle in the chamber, Bryant
last week assured senators that he would stay away from the sexual
detail of Ms. Lewinsky's relationship with the president and ask
her to ``simply affirm those provisions'' of her prior testimony in
this realm.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that on Monday when Bryant started to ask a
question getting into sexual detail, Cacheris, her lawyer,
objected. DeWine and Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, who was acting
as the lead senator for the Democrats, quickly held the question to
be out of line.
</P>
<P>
   It had been considered unlikely that Ms. Lewinsky would break
substantial new ground because under her immunity agreement with
the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, she could be prosecuted for
changing her story.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the White House went into the session with some
assurances that explosive new information was unlikely to emerge
and it could take the magnanimous route of simply making an
apology.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before the questioning began Monday morning, the White House
also went on the offensive against Starr because of a story in The
New York Times on Sunday. Citing associates of Starr, the article
said the independent counsel had decided he had the constitutional
authority to seek an indictment of Clinton while he is in office.
It said he had not decided if he would do so.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, Clinton's private attorney, said he was asking a
federal court to require the independent counsel to show why he and
his staff ``should not be held in contempt for improper violations
of grand jury secrecy.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr said in a statement that he was ``deeply troubled'' by the
story and that his office ``has no desire to inject itself into the
constitutional process under way in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was ``launching an internal investigation to
determine whether anyone in this office improperly disclosed the
information.''

SUPER BOWL NOTEBOOK: SHANAHAN GIVES ELWAY A DEADLINE
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Fresh from his second consecutive Super Bowl victory,
John Elway stood before a crowd of reporters Monday morning and
left open the possibility, however slight, that he would return
next season to go for three in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be nice to come back and three-peat,'' he said, quite
aware that it has never been done in the National Football League.
``But it'd be nice to walk away at the level that I'm playing right
now. I don't want to walk away too late, but I also know that if I
play like I played last night that I can play a little bit longer.
There will be a bunch of things that go into the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all week and I said this last year that it's a 90
percent chance I'm going to quit,'' Elway said. ``But the last
thing I want to do is shut the door. I don't want to say that I'm
done, then get into March or April and say that I can play one more
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway said he would talk to his wife and children, his parents
and Coach Mike Shanahan as he ponders whether at age 38, coming off
a season in which he missed four starts with hamstring and back
injuries, he wants to do this one more time.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan said Monday that he would give Elway about two months
to decide whether he wanted to return. But the truth is, Shanahan
would probably like to know right now what Elway wants to do.
That's because the free-agency signing period in the NFL begins
Feb. 13, and if Elway is not coming back, the Broncos might want to
act quickly to bolster their quarterback situation, where the
veteran Bubby Brister is now No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Shanahan expressed patience Monday when asked
how long he would wait for Elway to give him an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he can tell us by the draft, that would help us out,''
Shanahan said.
</P>
<P>
   The college draft will take place April 17. But since the
Broncos may already have a quarterback-in-waiting in Brian Griese,
a rookie out of Michigan this season, it is conceivable that Denver
will be less interested in drafting a top prospect and more intent
on acquiring a veteran through free agency or a trade.
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, Shanahan nominated the 36-year-old Brister
as the incumbent if Elway did retire. And Brister did have a good
season in 1998, going 4-0 as Elway's replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Brister completed almost 60 percent of his passes and threw for
10 touchdowns and only 3 interceptions. He has not been the No. 1
quarterback for an NFL team since 1990, however, when he started
for the Pittsburgh Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   STINGY DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   The usually overlooked, and sometimes maligned, Broncos defense
roared through three playoff games yielding all of two touchdowns.
And the last one it allowed came in the closing minutes Sunday
night, when the game had already been decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty special,'' the defensive coordinator Greg
Robinson said. ``It really is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins did not score a touchdown in the divisional
playoff. The Jets produced only one, on a Curtis Martin run, and
that was set up by a blocked punt that gave the Jets the ball on
Denver's 1-yard line. The only other touchdown was Terance Mathis'
3-yard reception from Chris Chandler on Sunday night with the
Falcons trailing, 34-13, and 2 minutes 4 seconds left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   REEVES GOES 0 FOR 4
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reeves has been to the Super Bowl nine times as a player,
assistant coach and head coach. But with the Falcons' loss on
Sunday night he joined Minnesota's Bud Grant, Buffalo's Marv Levy
and Don Shula of Baltimore and Miami as the only head coaches whose
teams lost four games. Reeves' previous three came with Denver.
</P>
<P>
   AN UNEASY FEELING
</P>
<P>
   Mike Shanahan looked around Pro Player Stadium before the Super
Bowl and felt uneasy. The last time the Broncos were there, for a
Monday night game on Dec. 21, they lost to the Miami Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   He spotted Jerry Seeman, the league's senior director of
officiating, and told him: ``The last time I was in this stadium I
went against a team that had no penalties. What is the chance of
that happening again?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Zero,'' Seeman said.
</P>
<P>
   He was wrong. The Falcons were called for no penalties while the
Broncos had four, not that it ultimately mattered.
</P>
<P>
   The usually tight-lipped Shanahan did not seem concerned Monday,
and said, with feigned annoyance, ``Jerry Seeman, where are you
now?''

7 WEEKS AFTER HEART SURGERY, REEVES SEEKS REST FROM FOOTBALL
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Dan Reeves was up before daybreak Monday, packing his
bags for the trip home. Only 49 days removed from heart-bypass
surgery, the Atlanta Falcons' coach talked of sleep deprivation and
the effects of his team's emotional playoff roller-coaster ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, I've got to take some time off, strictly because
I need some rest,'' Reeves said, sitting in a chair near the
Airport Hilton lobby. ``I need to get away where football doesn't
mean anything _ not even mentioned.''
</P>
<P>
   During the rest of this week, Reeves plans to attend to the
final details of this season, which ended painfully for him on
Sunday night with the Falcons' 34-19 loss to the Denver Broncos in
Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next week, he will begin a vacation with his wife, Pam,
lasting up to two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The 55-year-old native of Americus, Ga., is reasonably sure of
one thing: He wants to fulfill the remaining three years of his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't feel any inclination whatsoever not to do what my
contract calls for,'' Reeves said. ``As long as it's fun. We've got
things going. I'm back home and among family and friends. Very few
people have a chance to be a head coach, and to do it where you're
born and raised has really been special.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves acknowledged, however, that there might be a health
factor in his desire to continue coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not something that's come to my mind; now all of a
sudden you're questioning it,'' he said. ``I think you have to
evaluate everything. But hopefully it'll work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves did not particularly second-guess his cornerback Ray
Buchanan for guaranteeing an Atlanta victory, or himself for the
Falcons' failed fourth-down attempt from the Denver 26-yard line
early in the second quarter. Atlanta was trailing at the time, 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like we had to score a lot of points,'' Reeves said.
``They're a powerful offensive football team, and they were doing
exactly what we thought they were going to do in short yardage. Had
a play that we really loved _ in fact the Giants ran it in their
game against them. I thought they would jam it up thinking it was
short yardage. We tossed it outside and we just didn't execute.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamal Anderson was stopped for a loss of 2 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds after the game ended Sunday, Reeves sought out Denver
quarterback John Elway in an effort to congratulate him despite the
fact that Elway has been critical of Reeves, his former coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to do it and there was no way,'' Reeves said. ``And
really the only way you could do it was to find out where he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``John's a big reason I'm where I am today. When you're
competing against him, you're not happy for him as far as winning.
But when the game's over, it's over. There wasn't any problem there
whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his 16-3 Falcons, Reeves called them overachievers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel like when we walk on the field we can beat
anybody,'' he said. ``But we also can get beat by anybody if we
don't play well. I don't think anybody walks on the field and all
of sudden fears the Atlanta Falcons. I think they respect us.''

ARIZONA'S POLITICAL INSIDERS SHARE WISDOM ON IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIE AMPARANO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ They've sat in the inner sanctum, like Washington
power attorney Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   They are the consummate behind-the-scenes movers and shakers.
They are the right-hand advisers. As Jordan takes his turn today
with the deposition squad in President Clinton's impeachment trial,
I seek out the wisdom of Arizona's most trusted political insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, I find only one who will talk on the record.
</P>
<P>
   Others, declining to be identified, note what happened to Jordan
when HE &UR; opened his mouth. &QL; 
Jordan, perhaps the most intimate confidant of Bill Clinton's
kitchen cabinet, is expected to be grilled - again - about the
advice he gave the president regarding his sexual fling with Monica
Lewinsky and his role in helping the former White House intern find
a job.
</P>
<P>
   One guru of Arizona's business and political world declines to
be identified at all, pointing to the trouble Jordan has gotten
himself into. ``Nothing good comes out of being too public,''
explains this powerhouse, who has counseled many Hispanic
lawmakers. ``I hope you understand.''
</P>
<P>
   I turn to the governor's office to see what insights can be
found there.
</P>
<P>
   Like Jordan, Rick Collins is skilled at skirting questions about
the impeachment trial that could be viewed as controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the one to ask. I'm too busy focusing on naughty
legislators right now,'' says Collins, the chief of staff for Gov.
Jane Hull, referring to lawmakers who weren't budging on
legislation important to the administration. ``I'll pass on it, if
that's all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Calls to other political insiders aren't returned.
</P>
<P>
   But Jay Heiler has plenty to say. He was the right-hand man for
Gov. Fife Symington, who resigned from office after being indicted
for fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what it's like to be standing by someone who is under
fire,'' says the former chief of staff. ``But you can't let
yourself become divorced from the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Now practicing law and cultivating his public affairs consulting
business, Heiler says if he could advise Jordan, he'd give him this
message: ``The duty to tell the truth is more important than his
duties of loyalty to his friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, Heiler then offers a more personal view of the
affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want my peanut gallery view, Washington and everything
happening there has become so irrelevant and distasteful to the
average citizen,'' says Heiler. ``That's why no one cares.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
As President Clinton's impeachment trial progresses, Julie Amparano
will be taking the pulse of people in the Valley. Do they care
about President Clinton's trial? Do they want him removed from
office? What does captivate Americans? She looks for the answers.

TIME WARNER JOINS FORCES WITH AT&AMP;T 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Texas, Calif.)  (lb) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ AT&AMP;T Corp. and Time Warner Inc. joined forces on
Monday to sell local telephone service over Time Warner's millions
of cable television lines, a venture that could provide consumers
with a major alternative to the Baby Bells and GTE Corp., which now
dominate that $100 billion business.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, the leading long-distance company, and Time Warner, the
entertainment giant that serves 12.6 million cable television
customers in 33 states, said they would sell local phone service in
one or two undisclosed Time Warner markets this year, with a goal
of expanding the offering in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The companies also aimed for savings of at least 20 percent over
the competition. A customer's telephone would function normally,
but the wall connection would connect to the same outside cable
that provides TV service.
</P>
<P>
   After it finishes acquiring Tele-Communications Inc., the No. 2
cable company, later this year, AT&AMP;T also plans to offer local
phone service using cable lines in 10 of TCI's markets, including
Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   For Time Warner's 1.1 million subscribers in New York City, the
deal could bring a widespread local phone alternative to Bell
Atlantic Corp. within a few years. Time Warner is the main cable
television company in Manhattan and in parts of Brooklyn, Queens
and Staten Island. The Bronx is served almost entirely by
Cablevision Systems Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Coming seven months after the announcement of the TCI deal,
Monday's agreement put AT&AMP;T in position to pose a serious threat in
coming years to the Baby Bells and GTE.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has about half of the $80 billion long-distance market. It
stopped providing local phone service to settle a federal antitrust
suit in 1984, but the Telecommunications Act of 1996 removed many
regulatory barriers and it allows AT&AMP;T to re-enter that business.
</P>
<P>
   Were it to fully exploit the agreements it now has with cable
carriers, AT&AMP;T could offer local phone service to more than 40
percent of the United States' homes.
</P>
<P>
   For Time Warner, Monday's agreement largely answered years of
questions about how the media titan would use advances in digital
technology to expand its cable television business to provide much
more than TV programming. While the initial agreement between AT&AMP;T
and Time Warner covers only telephone service, the two companies
said Monday that they would try to enlarge its scope to include
high-speed links to cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a significant step in our strategy of offering
broadband communications in our consumer business,'' said Michael
Armstrong, AT&AMP;T's chairman, using communications jargon for
advanced, high-speed services. He said that AT&AMP;T's goal was to be
able to offer local service to as many as 65 percent of U.S. homes.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, before Armstrong took over as AT&AMP;T's chairman,
the company was struggling to break into local communications
markets using the copper telephone wires owned by the Bell
companies. But when AT&AMP;T agreed to buy TCI, it became clear that
AT&AMP;T saw television cables as its lines to the future. It was the
apparent depth of AT&AMP;T's commitment that brought Time Warner to the
table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, there have been discussions and we have looked at
this capacity of our plant for some time,'' said Gerald Levin, Time
Warner's chairman. ``But we never could have made the arrangement
with an AT&AMP;T that hadn't already committed itself to cable. It
built a form of trust and compatibility that wouldn't otherwise be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said AT&AMP;T was already negotiating to form joint
ventures with other big cable companies, though he would not
identify them. The other cable giants _ including Comcast, Cox and
Cablevision _ seem likely. Leo Hindery Jr., TCI's president, who is
set to run the cable operations of the combined AT&AMP;T-TCI, said he
expected AT&AMP;T to announce deals with additional cable carriers by
late spring.
</P>
<P>
   Media One Group Inc. owns 25 percent of Time Warner
Entertainment, a partnership that owns many of Time Warner's cable
operations, so Media One must approve Monday's deal. Steve Lang, a
Media One spokesman, said that his company had not yet seen details
but that Media One was itself considering a similar deal with AT&AMP;T,
as well as with other partners.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T and Time Warner said their deal would not require approval
from federal or state regulators. A Time Warner spokesman, however,
ventured that the agreement could require approval from some local
authorities. It was unclear Monday whether New York City would have
to approve the deal.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In any case, some analysts said Monday it was unlikely that AT&AMP;T
and Time Warner would make New York City a priority for introducing
the local phone service. Communications companies are often slow to
bring new services to New York City because the sheer scale of the
city can pose unique technical challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Communications executives also sometimes want to work kinks out
of their new products before they subject them to hard-to-please
New York City consumers.
</P>
<P>
   For Time Warner's shareholders, perhaps the critical element of
the agreement is that it does not require Time Warner to make any
new investments. Time Warner is already in the middle of a $4
billion project to make its cable systems ready to offer advanced
digital services generally, but AT&AMP;T has agreed to carry the
financial load of providing local telephone capability.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, AT&AMP;T would pay Time Warner $15 for each of the
homes passed by Time Warner's cable lines as Time Warner makes the
basic upgrades in those lines. Because Time Warner's systems pass
about 20 million homes (though only 12.6 million homes subscribe),
those payments could total $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T also agreed to spend about $300 million to provide backup
power systems for Time Warner's cable hubs. The additional power
units are meant to help ensure that telephones linked to the cable
network continue to function even if the television part of the
system malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   Each new subscriber would result in an additional AT&AMP;T
investment of between $300 and $500 for switching equipment and for
a unit that would sit on the side of each house that would connect
the house's standard telephones to the cable system.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T guaranteed that 25 percent of homes passed by Time Warner's
lines would subscribe to the new phone service within six years,
and said that Time Warner would get up to $6 every month for each
of those customers. In addition, AT&AMP;T said it would give Time
Warner 15 percent of customer revenue exceeding $100 a month if the
average per-home bill in a given market came to more than $100.
</P>
<P>
   In return, AT&AMP;T owns 77.5 percent of the new joint venture,
which is meant to last at least 20 years, while Time Warner owns
the rest. The companies expect the new venture to become profitable
after three years.
</P>
<P>
   Investors appeared to view the deal as better for AT&AMP;T than for
Time Warner. AT&AMP;T's shares gained $2.8125 to close at $93.5625 on
the New York Stock Exchange, while Time Warner's shares lost 18.75
cents to close at $62.3125. Shares of GTE and of each of the Baby
Bells except BellSouth Corp. also lost value.
</P>
<P>
   But demonstrating that the Bells are not standing still,
executives close to Bell Atlantic Corp., the No. 1 local phone
company, said that company would announce a deal on Tuesday with
IBM to sell an IBM product that links home computers with one
another using either the standard phone lines or cable television
wires within a home. The product would cost about $1,000, the
executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatives to the Bells continue to emerge, however.
Executives close to Psinet Inc., a big provider of Internet service
for business customers, said Psinet would announce Tuesday that it
planned to offer Internet links using advanced wireless systems in
50 markets.

 &HT;    Florida lottery rolls over to $64 million
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Florida's lottery jackpot has rolled over to
$64 million, the largest in the nation at the moment and fourth
largest in state history.
</P>
<P>
   The pot grows as Gov. Jeb Bush nears a decision on whether to
let Florida join the 20-state Powerball lottery after two years of
declining Lotto sales.
</P>
<P>
   With five days of ticket sales left until the next drawing
Saturday night, the jackpot is already the largest in Florida since
$81.2 milllion in April 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 4 p.m. (Monday), sales were $4,020 per minute, about four
times what they were a week ago,'' said lottery spokesman Dave
Rhea, referring to sales of the $1 tickets. ``On Saturday about 7
p.m. (shortly before the drawing produced no winner), they peaked
at $27,600 per minute. So yes, it's busy.''
</P>
<P>
   The question for Bush is whether the presumed benefits of
Powerball _ such as sales generated by occasional huge jackpots
including a world-record $161.5 million _ outweigh an expected
decrease in Lotto sales. Sales contribute hundreds of millions of
dollars annually to state schools and scholarships. Bush aides and
Powerball officials didn't return calls Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A $64 million jackpot could be taken in annual payments spread
over 30 years or an immediate lump sum of about half the value, $32
million. Lottery officials conservatively expect the jackpot to
grow above $70 million this week, though if sales remain brisk it
could well go higher.

AMERICAN AIRLINES PILOTS THREATEN A WORK SLOWDOWN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev.)  (ms) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pilots at American Airlines are threatening a work slowdown if a
dispute over the nation's second-largest carrier's recent
acquisition of a small airline that flies in the western states is
not resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots contend that the Dec. 23 purchase of Reno Air, which
is based in Nevada and flies to 16 cities mostly in the West,
violates the so-called scope clause in their contract. That clause
guarantees that any planes owned by American will be flown by
members of the Allied Pilots Association, the independent union
that represents its 9,200 pilots.
</P>
<P>
   American said that it fully intends to integrate Reno's 25 jets
and 300 pilots into its much larger network but that it would take
12 to 18 months because Reno's airplanes need to be upgraded and
pilots from both carriers need to be retrained.
</P>
<P>
   Reno pilots earn roughly half what their counterparts at
American are paid, about $150,000 a year on average plus a generous
retirement payout.
</P>
<P>
   The union fears that American's real agenda is to maintain Reno
as a separate low-cost carrier, something the American pilots have
not agreed to in past contract negotiations with the airline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The line pilots are about as angry about this as I have seen
them in my eight years at the company,'' said Drew Engelke, a pilot
and spokesman for the union. ``They believe that scope is the heart
of the contract and they hold it very dear.''
</P>
<P>
   American executives were also steamed. Don Carty, chief
executive of the AMR &UR;  &LR; Corp., American's parent, blew up at a Jan. 8
meeting with union leaders and stormed out, according to Engelke
and others. American confirmed that the meeting took place but
declined to comment on what happened. On Saturday, Rich LaVoy, the
pilot union's president, told members in a telephone message that
he had sent a letter to Carty telling him that if the airline went
ahead with plans to sell seats on Reno flights as if they were part
of the American network it ``would create a major dispute between
us.''
</P>
<P>
   In the parlance of the Railway Labor Act, the arcane law that
governs labor relations in the airline industry, a ``major
dispute'' allows the union to strike or take other, less
disruptive, actions.
</P>
<P>
   Many pilots were urging the union to move this week after a
Sunday deadline passed without an agreement. But union leaders
convinced members to give negotiators an extra week to try to
resolve the dispute. They have proposed that American commit to
completing the integration of Reno by June 23. Talks between the
union and the airline are scheduled to resume Tuesday. The union's
negotiators will brief the board of directors in a conference call
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have a week that doesn't produce much of anything, there
will be a sense that we need to increase the pressure on
management,'' said Gregg Overman, another union spokesman. ``What
form that takes I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The union's most likely action, according to members and
analysts, would be to encourage pilots to refuse to do
discretionary flying. That is what the pilots did last summer, when
the union accused American of putting too many of its passengers on
Canadian Airlines, one of American's international partners.
American was forced to cancel 500 of its 6,300 flights in both July
and August and to reduce its schedule 2 percent to 4 percent in
September and October before it agreed to reduce the number of
Canadian flights also sold as American.
</P>
<P>
   If the pilots decided to decline discretionary flying, American
flights would not be affected until the end of the month, though
the airline might cancel some flights in advance and book
passengers on others.  &QL;

<P>
   N'DALATANDO, Angola _ ``Unita was coming in, and I was afraid I
would have my head cut off, so I took my family and ran,'' said
Sebastian Domingos, 34, a war refugee in a tattered shirt and a
baseball cap with a very faded Calvin Klein logo on it. ``They
would find out I don't support them, and that's what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   The thatched hut in which he has lived for six weeks in a
refugee camp in this provincial capital is no temporary shelter.
The mud-brick camp was built in the 1960s when N'dalatando was full
of refugees from Zaire, and like a hermit crab's shell, it gets
different owners as the tides of displaced people shift with the
ebb and flow of war.
</P>
<P>
   Now it houses people fleeing south from the towns of Bula Atumba
and Banga, where the rebel Unita movement and the Angolan
government are fighting. As Domingos spoke, there were two busloads
of people fleeing west from Malanje only a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the capital, Luanda, is acting nonchalant, the
rebels are seizing towns relatively close by.
</P>
<P>
   N'dalatando, 120 miles southeast of Luanda, is in government
hands, and the local police said there had been no fighting nearby.
But it is a touchy place, a hive of police officers and
citizen-soldiers toting AK-47s, because it has an airport and
controls the main east-west paved road.
</P>
<P>
   Bula Atumba and two nearby towns that Unita has seized are only
100 miles from Luanda, and there are reliable reports that armed
rebels are patrolling Caxito, which is only 50 miles from Luanda.
</P>
<P>
   Malanje, Cuito and Huambo, the chief cities of the central
plateau, have been under artillery attack. And the eastern
two-thirds of the country is still considered Unita territory even
where the government controls cities.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 25 the government conceded that it had lost Mbanza
Congo, capital of the northernmost province. The town sits on the
road to Soyo on the coast, where Texaco has offshore drilling
operations, an important source of government income.
</P>
<P>
   The fall of nearby towns does not mean that the capital is
doomed. Historically, this has been a guerrilla war, with the
government holding cities and the rebels terrorizing the
countryside, overrunning some urban garrisons, and eventually
melting back into the bush.
</P>
<P>
   What is crucial to the government are the coastal towns: Luanda,
which is near the country's only oil refinery; Lobito and Benguela
with their big military bases; Soyo with its oil, and the whole
oil-rich province of Cabinda, separated from Angola proper by a
strip of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
   But the speed with which Unita has struck back since the
government tried to smash it in early December has surprised
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Since Luanda has more than a third of the country's 11 million
people, it presumably can defend itself if militias are raised and
stay loyal. The oil enclaves have employed heavily armed private
security in the past, although that did not save two eastern
diamond mines attacked by Unita in the last few months.
</P>
<P>
   As in the past, there are rumors of mercenaries everywhere. A
Portuguese newspaper reported that at least 300 Cuban advisers had
arrived. Its correspondents were promptly deported. The government
admits to only a few ``medical and agricultural advisers'' from
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Jakkie Potgeiter, a military analyst with the Institute for
Security Studies, a South African defense research organization,
said he had heard credible reports that Ukrainians who had sold
artillery and anti-aircraft guns to Unita were helping to operate
them, and sketchier reports that former South African infantry
officers were training Unita troops.
</P>
<P>
   Alcides Sakala, Unita's foreign secretary, suggested that ``for
security reasons'' all foreigners should leave the contested
interior. ``The worst is to come,'' he warned.

DOCTOR WRITES BOOK ON PARENTING FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (resend to fix garble) 
 
By BARBARA KARKABI 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) All new parents have the same questions and worries
about their babies, toddlers and preschoolers. Are they healthy?
How can I find the best child care? How do I discipline without
spanking?
</P>
<P>
   But for African-American parents the questions can be even more
challenging. Black mothers and fathers wonder about locating a
pediatrician with the same values or question whether their child
should go to an all-black preschool. They want suggestions about
books with strong black characters and advice on talking to their
children about race and racism.
</P>
<P>
   It was concerns like these, plus her own experiences as a
mother, that compelled Dr. Anne C. Beal to write ``The Black
Parenting Book'' (Broadway Books, $20) with co-authors Linda
Villarosa and Allison Abner. The comprehensive work focuses on the
first five years of a child's life.
</P>
<P>
   So many baby books, for instance, said Beal, talk about newborn
rashes, but don't touch on the rashes and illnesses that are more
common in African-American children, who tend to have dry skin.
Beal discusses those, but she also addresses broader issues like
spirituality, racism, stress and the challenges facing single
mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Several other books have been written specifically for black
parents _ perhaps the best-known being ``Raising Black Children``
by Dr. Alvin F. Poussaint. But Beal's book has garnered praise from
parents and pediatricians as a practical book that will help the
parents of America's 3.6 million black children under age 6 deal
with questions for the '90s and into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen any combination of this information all in one
source,'' said Binta Chui, a teacher and parent who attended Beal's
book-signing in Houston last month. ``I've seen bits and pieces
here and there. We talked about why we thought black parents need
that kind of book. Most blacks, if they have problems, call their
mother or aunt; we don't turn to books because we feel there is
nothing we can trust. But we need a resource like that to help us
know we are going in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   In talking to parents, Beal said, she found the biggest concerns
revolving around racial pride and self-esteem, as well as when to
talk to children about race and racism. For some of the answers,
Beal, a specialist in medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital
and Harvard Medical School, gives examples from her experiences
with her own daughters, now 6 and 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question that seems to present itself at an earlier
time for African-American children,'' she said. ``Children at 3 and
4 are very aware of their environment, and descriptive _ this is
blue, this is green, this is white. But then they will notice that
they look different from other people they see around them, and
they say, `How come I look like this and my day-care teacher looks
like that?' That starts the explanation: `You are African-American
and you have brown skin ... but we come in a range of colors.'''
</P>
<P>
   Beal, who also writes a parenting columnist for Essence
magazine, stressed that the issues are complicated and complex and
must be addressed at appropriate developmental levels. Recognize,
she said, that these questions will come up over and over again and
must be handled in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important that we should always teach our children the
truth and never be in the position where they learn one thing and
have to relearn another,'' she said. ``You need to peel it like an
onion and then give them pieces they understand. After they
understand there are differences, then go on to explain that
because there are different races and groupings of people,
sometimes people don't like each other based on the way they look _
whether it's hair, skin or crooked teeth or that they are in a
wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later on they can understand that there is a direction that
historically has occurred in this country over these types of
issues,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Skin-care issues are common early on, when parents ask why their
children are born with a light complexion and wonder if they will
get darker. The answer, Beal said, is yes.
</P>
<P>
   Parents worry about ``cradle cap,'' a type of dermatitis that,
when it heals, often leaves African-American infants with splotches
or ``hyper-pigmented'' areas. Beal assures parents that it's
natural and the normal skin color will return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our children tend to have more dry skin and are sensitive to a
lot of these beautiful lotions that smell great but have perfumes
which irritate the skin,'' Beal said.
</P>
<P>
   Other issues addressed in the book include asthma, a chronic
disease that is becoming increasingly common in African-American
children, and questions about discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Parents want to know whether they should spank. Beal said that
respect for elders is important in the African-American community,
as is acting in an appropriate fashion.

 2 S.F. Ad Agencies Bought by Boston Firm  &HT;       
 By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Ingalls Moranville Advertising and Rockpile Interactive, two San
Francisco ad agencies that focus on technology, have been acquired
by Boston's Arnold Communications, Arnold said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Ingalls Moranville's annual billings totaled about $40 million,
and Rockpile's were about $20 million, said Ed Dilworth, Rockpile's
founder and chief executive of the new unit, to be called Arnold
Ingalls Moranville.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the sale were not disclosed, but a knowledgeable source
said the combined price tag was under $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Dilworth said he approached Arnold about buying Rockpile after
working with the Boston company on some West Coast account pitches.
But before a sale could be completed, Rockpile, which specialized
in Internet advertising, needed a partner to handle traditional
media. Dilworth then approached Ingalls Moranville, which was
amenable to a combination.
</P>
<P>

YANKS TRADE TOP PROSPECT FOR MINOR LEAGUE PITCHERS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yankees traded one of their top infield
prospects, Mike Lowell, to the Florida Marlins on Monday for three
minor league pitchers in the latest effort by General Manager Brian
Cashman to restock the organization's pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell, a third baseman who turns 25 this month, had been
regarded as a marginal prospect before the 1997 season, when he
slugged 30 homers in 135 games. Then, last year, after a terrific
spring-training performance, he batted .304 with 26 homers and 99
RBIs for Class AAA Columbus, and went 4 for 15 in eight games with
the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1998 season, the Yankees had acquired Scott Brosius
from the Oakland A's, and it was widely assumed within the Yankees'
hierarchy that Lowell would be given a chance to replace Brosius in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   But Brosius was a stunning success last year, hitting .300,
driving in 98 runs and playing exceptional defense during the
regular season, before winning the most valuable player award in
the World Series. The Yankees re-signed Brosius to a three-year,
$15.75 million deal in November, making Lowell expendable. He will
likely become the Marlins' regular third baseman this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy for him,'' said Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager,
``because he was going to have to wait a couple of years to play
for us, and he's probably ready to play in the big leagues right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   In return for Lowell, the Yankees received three highly rated
young pitchers, each of whom was involved in a previous trade that
involved a big name. Ed Yarnall, a 23-year-old left-hander, was a
part of the Mets organization until he was shipped to the Marlins
in the package for Mike Piazza. Mark Johnson is a former
first-round pick of the Houston Astros who was sent to Florida in a
trade for outfielder Moises Alou. And Todd Noel is a 20-year-old
right-hander who was a first-round pick of the Chicago Cubs in
1996, then was traded to Florida last season for the reliever Felix
Heredia.
</P>
<P>
   Executives with other teams gave the Yankees high marks for this
trade, saying all three pitchers possess excellent potential and
could develop into major league pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman has been trying to replenish the organization's pitching
in recent months, after the Yankees became somewhat thin in this
area last year. Last February, the Yankees traded their top minor
league pitcher, Eric Milton, to Minnesota as part of the deal for
the second baseman Chuck Knoblauch. During the summer, another
prospect prized by the Yankees, Luis Delos Santos, struggled and
was demoted to Class A, and Ricardo Aramboles, a hard-throwing
right-hander, suffered a major elbow injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are loaded in the big leagues _ with the 20-game
winner David Cone, the left-handers David Wells and Andy Pettitte,
and the right-handers Orlando Hernandez, Hideki Irabu and Ramiro
Mendoza _ but have little in reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never have enough pitching,'' Cashman said. ``Pitching is
the name of the game. If we could utilize Lowell by trading him and
bringing three legitimate prospects into the organization, we were
going to do it.''  &QL;

 Sizing Up Online Brokers  &HT;       
 By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. charges twice as much as E-Trade Group _
$29.95 versus $14.95 _ for each online brokerage trade it
processes, so it must be twice as good, right?
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gomez Advisors, an independent consulting firm that
compiles a widely followed quarterly report card on 55 Internet
brokers, E-Trade provides generally better online service than
Schwab and has superior research tools on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Another online broker that charges markedly less than Schwab _
DLJ Direct, at $20 per trade _ outranks Schwab in all six of the
performance measures on the Gomez report card.
</P>
<P>
   The old saw that price reflects quality _ that you get what you
pay for _ is becoming less and less reliable in the online
brokerage industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the fierce competition to lure and retain customers in this
rapidly burgeoning industry, online brokers are becoming more and
more similar to one another.
</P>
<P>
   Even bargain-basement firms such as Suretrade ($7.95 per trade)
and Ameritrade ($8) have been adding research, stock charting, news
updates, stock-screening tools and other Web site features that
compare favorably with the offerings long available from industry
leaders such as Schwab and Fidelity Investments.
</P>
<P>
   Ameritrade, which a year ago &LR;   &LR; provided little more than a
bare-bones transaction service, now offers its customers research
reports and a stock-screening tool from Market Guide, covering
10,000 public companies. Ameritrade customers also can pull up
earnings estimates from First Call and news updates from Dow Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time one of us comes out with something new and
interesting, the others seek to match it,'' observes Matt Sadler,
Fidelity's senior vice president for brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade, which pioneered online brokerage a scant seven years
ago, has lately embarked on a binge of service-enhancing moves.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  It has done so at a steep price, spending more than $100
million in the past year to improve the technology and content of
its Web site. As a result, it reported losses totaling nearly $30
million in the six months ended December 31.
</P>
<P>
   At present, E-Trade has 544,000 customers, according to Piper
Jaffray, or a bit more than one-fourth of industry leader Schwab's
online total.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month alone, E-Trade:
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of ONLINE02 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  _Created an online tax-preparation service, allowing customers to
prepare and file federal and state taxes through its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   _Gave its customers direct access to TheStreet.com, a leading
Internet provider of financial news and commentary.
</P>
<P>
   _Struck a deal with United Airlines to provide frequent-flier
miles to people who do business with E-Trade.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade previously made a big splash by adding analyst
recommendations from BancBoston Robertson Stephens and access to
initial public offerings from that firm.
</P>
<P>
   It also maintains its own investor chat room _ evidently the
only one on a brokerage Web site _ where customers can trade rumors
and opinions about stocks and industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are focused on creating a one-stop financial-services
center,'' says Lisa Nash, E-Trade's vice president for corporation
communications and customer management.
</P>
<P>
   Its efforts have rocketed E-Trade to the highest rating overall
among the brokers surveyed by Gomez, with an overall score of 7.32
(on a scale from 0 to 10). E-Trade is tied with DLJ Direct in the
quality of its on-site resources _ the tools that customers use to
make investment decisions _ with a score of 8.82.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez bases its ratings on customer questionnaires, its own
observations of the Web sites and interviews with the brokerage
executives.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab, despite its top-of-the-line commission, remains the
largest online broker measured both by number of customers _ 2
million _ and share of online trading volume (27.4 percent last
quarter).
</P>
<P>
   Most of those online customers have moved over to Schwab's
Internet site from conventional brokerage accounts. Schwab still
has more than 3 million customers who only trade the old-fashioned
way _ by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the majority of our business, the first point of contact
continues to be the branch'' rather than the Web, says Schwab
spokeswoman Tracey Gordon. ``People want to kick the tires.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the firm's online traders are far more active than
their conventional counterparts. Online trades now account for 61
percent of Schwab's total _ up from 41 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   While the $29.95 that Schwab's online customers pay for each
trade is high by online standards, it is substantially lower than
the $55 minimum Schwab charges for conventional trades.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab has been able to maintain both market leadership and a
high commission because of what might be called the Tiffany factor.
People who shop at Tiffany's pay more for jewelry than they do
elsewhere because of the firm's venerable name and stately
emporiums, and the confidence they inspire.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, Schwab boasts a time-honored name dating back
a quarter-century and a reassuring, tangible presence at nearly 300
branches.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of ONLINE02 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``People want to know that they are buying quality _ a
respectable brand,'' says Alex Stein, a principal with Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   But Schwab's Tiffany-like reputation appears to be losing some
of its luster. Its customer confidence rating, as measured by
Gomez, slipped from 9.05 a year ago to 8.21 in December, ranking it
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The customer confidence rating is based on such factors as
well-trained customer service staffs, easy accessibility to a
firm's Web site and fast response time when customers try to reach
a broker by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab ranks eighth on the Gomez list in overall quality and
fifth in the quality of its on-site resources.
</P>
<P>
   Like other leading online brokers, Schwab has had trouble
maintaining its service standards lately because of the tremendous
surge in online trading volume.
</P>
<P>
   Last quarter, total industry volume surged 34 percent, according
to Credit Suisse First Boston, spurred largely by wild speculation
in Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Customers of Schwab and other firms have found themselves
waiting longer to gain access to broker Web sites, move from page
to page and execute trades. They also are finding it harder to
reach customer-service representatives by telephone when they have
questions or problems.
</P>
<P>
   Teri Felix, Schwab's vice president for electronic brokerage
marketing, acknowledges that the firm's customers have been waiting
longer lately to get their telephone queries answered.
</P>
<P>
   Felix claims that ``less than 20 seconds'' is the Schwab norm,
but that some customers have lately been forced to wait up to seven
minutes to talk to service representatives. However, some Schwab
customers say they have encountered delays as long as 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That could prove a significant setback for Schwab, because in
the past one of the firm's great selling points has been its quick
response to phone calls. If Schwab comes to be perceived as just
another online firm that keeps its phone-in customers eternally on
hold, it could have trouble keeping customers and maintaining its
fees.
</P>
<P>
   As other firms begin to look more and more like Schwab, ``savvy
consumers will take a closer look at the price differential,''
predicts John Payne, an analyst with the Cerulli Associates
consulting firm in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Novice investors looking for an online broker _ or experienced
investors looking to change their brokers _ can view the complete
Gomez ratings at  &LR; www.gomez.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Another useful resource is the annual report on discount brokers
published by the American Association of Individual Investors. It
includes a section comparing 72 online firms.
</P>
<P>
   The AAII doesn't provide quality rankings. But it does give a
thumbnail listing of each broker's research resources, outlines the
commission structures, and provides other point-by-point
comparisons to help you narrow your choice.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 3 of ONLINE02 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  You can get a copy of the latest report, which was issued last
month, by writing the AAII at 625 N. Michigan Ave., Suite 1900,
Chicago, Ill. 60611-3110, or by calling (312) 280-0170.
</P>
<P>
   While the Gomez and AAII reports will help you sort the wheat
from the chaff, you also ought to explore the broker Web sites
yourself. Most of them let noncustomers take a demonstration tour
that offers a good feel for the online resources.
</P>
<P>
   Only you can decide how many and what kinds of resources you
need. Check out the brokers that offer those resources, then choose
the one that offers them for the lowest commission per trade.
</P>
<P>
   You may decide that you don't need any research help at all _
that a low price is everything. In that case, your logical choice
probably would be Brown &AMP; Co., the lowest-priced online broker at
$5 per trade, and one of the very few that still maintains only a
bare-bones site.
</P>
<P>
   Brown lets you trade securities, of course, and it will display
a history of your transactions, show your current holdings and
balance, and respond to requests for cash from your account. But
that's it.

 Judge Blocks Child Online Protection Act  &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
In a victory for free-speech advocates and another blow to
anti-cyberporn lobbyists, a federal judge yesterday blocked the
government's latest attempt to shield children from pornography on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; U.S. District Judge Lowell Reed of Philadelphia continued a
preliminary injunction against the Child Online Protection Act,
which would require U.S. commercial Web sites with sexual content
deemed ``harmful to minors'' to block access to those under 18 by
using a credit card or age-verification system.
</P>
<P>
   Reed had issued a temporary restraining order in November
against the act that expired at midnight last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps we do the minors of this country harm if First
Amendment protections, which they will with age inherit fully, are
chipped away in the name of their protection,'' Reed said in a
strongly worded 49-page opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs led by the American Civil Liberties Union had pressed
Reed during a six-day hearing last month to extend the preliminary
injunction blocking the act's enforcement, paving the way for a
full trial to have the law overturned.
</P>
<P>
   A judge's clerk said the injunction would remain in place until
the ACLU case reaches trial. A court date is expected this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``This proves that the statute was unconstitutional and
ineffectual,'' said Alan Davidson, staff counsel of the Center for
Democracy and Technology, an online civil liberties group in
Washington that also filed a brief objecting to the act.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Justice Department, which could appeal the
decision, said government lawyers ``are reviewing the judge's
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed but not surprised,'' said Shyla Welch, a
spokeswoman for Enough Is Enough, an Internet safety organization
in Fairfax, Va. ``This bipartisan law had broad public support.
It's a perfect example of the ACLU trying to foist its agenda on
the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Though passed overwhelmingly by Congress and signed into law by
President Clinton in October, the controversial law has yet to go
into into effect.
</P>
<P>
   The act is a watered-down successor to the Communications
Decency Act, which was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court on
First Amendment grounds in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of INTERNET () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The new law is more narrowly focused, however, because it applies
only to commercial Web sites and tries to clearly define
objectionable material. Authors of the bill identify
``objectionable sexual material'' as lacking ``serious literary,
artistic, political or scientific value'' for those under 18. Web
operators who violate the law could get up to six months in jail
and a $50,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say the law is necessary to shield children from a
myriad of graphic sexual images and obscene material readily
available on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   In arguments before Reed last week, the Justice Department said
the law is merely an ``electronic brown paper bag'' for Web sites
that peddle X-rated material.
</P>
<P>
   ``COPA is concerned with what's clearly pornographic. Those who
are there to excite, entice and fill their coffers,'' Justice
attorney Karen Stewart said in the government's closing argument
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playboy and Penthouse are protected speech for adults, but not
kids,'' Welch said. ``We just want to extend those same laws to
cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the law said it violates the First Amendment and
could be exploited by social conservatives to prosecute AIDS
activists, abortion groups, artists or gays who distribute
information over the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be up to parents, and not the government, to decide
what children should see,'' ACLU attorney Chris Hansen said. ``This
case was about speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Others _ such as Donna Hoffman, a Vanderbilt University
professor who is an expert on e-commerce _ said the law might
inadvertently endanger mainstream commercial sites.
</P>
<P>
   Rachelle Chong, a former Federal Communications Commission
commissioner and partner at Coudert Bros. in San Francisco, added
that the law threatened to ``stand decades of obscenity law on its
ear'' because it set a national _ rather than local _ obscenity
standard. The U.S. Supreme Court has never approved a national
standard before.
</P>
<P>
   Parents would be better off if they opted for commercially
available filtering software to protect children from online
pornography rather than accept an ``ill-conceived law that limits
the rights of adults to free speech,'' Jerry Berman, executive
director of the CDT, said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of INTERNET () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The ACLU spearheaded a coalition of 17 businesses and
organizations _ among them, Salon, an online magazine; local poet
Lawrence Ferlinghetti; Planet Out, a gay and lesbian online service
in San Francisco; and the Internet Content Coalition, which
represents 23 Web publishers including Cnet in San Francisco.

 Charitable Remainder Trust Primer  &HT;       
 By Arthur M. Louis  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  Please explain the advantages and disadvantages of a
charitable remainder trust.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Setting up a charitable remainder trust might be worth
your while if you want to liquidate stocks or other assets that
have appreciated greatly, and you have a favorite charity to which
you would like to make a substantial gift.
</P>
<P>
   You can put your assets into a trust, sell them and reinvest the
funds without incurring a capital-gains tax. You get an immediate
charitable deduction for the tax year in which you set up the
trust, and you can withdraw a prearranged portion of the assets
annually for the rest of your life, to help with living expenses.
</P>
<P>
   When you die, the money that remains in the trust will go to the
charity of your choice.
</P>
<P>
   One disadvantage is that your gift to the trust is irrevocable.
If you get into financial trouble later, you can't take the money
back. Nor can you bring the money back into your estate for the
benefit of your heirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never recommend that anyone put more than one-third of
their net worth into one of these trusts,'' says San Francisco
financial planner Norm Boone.
</P>
<P>
   Charitable remainder trusts are a lot more complicated than this
necessarily brief description indicates. For example, the size of
your charitable deduction will depend on your age; in general, the
younger you are, the smaller it will be. And the money you withdraw
from the trust during your lifetime may be taxable as ordinary
income, capital gains or both.
</P>
<P>
   If you are thinking of setting up a charitable remainder trust,
you should first talk out the details with a good financial planner
or tax lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Down Payment Safety
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am planning to buy a house in about three months, using
$50,000 I have saved for a down payment. Where can I put the money
in the meantime to maximize my funds?
</P>
<P>
   A: Whoa! Don't gamble with the money _ not if you really want
that house. If you buy stocks, options, futures or any other risky
investment, you might very well ``maximize'' your funds. But then
again, you might suffer a substantial loss instead.
</P>
<P>
   Because you will need the money soon, you had better keep it in
an insured, interest-bearing account such as a CD. In three months,
your money will have earned several hundred dollars of interest _
enough to buy a nice armchair or appliance to spruce up your new
digs.
</P>
<P>
   Roth IRA Limits
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am currently contributing to a Roth Individual Retirement
Account and would like to continue doing so after I retire. My
retirement income will consist of Social Security, a pension and
interest from bank certificates of deposit. Will I be permitted to
go on contributing to my Roth?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: Alas, no _ not with that mix of income. The tax law says
that you can make annual contributions to your Roth IRA equal to
the sum of your ``earned income'' or $2,000, whichever is less. But
Social Security, pensions and bank interest normally don't qualify
as earned income.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of MONEYBAG () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``Most people might think that a pension or Social Security is
earned income, because you get it in recognition of work you did,''
says Internal Revenue Service spokesman Jesse Weller. ``But it is
treated as unearned income for tax purposes, because you aren't
working for it at the time you get it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one exception to that rule. If you are forced to retire
early on a disability pension, the money you get from the pension
counts as earned income. However, once you reach normal retirement
age _ as defined by your former employer _ your pension no longer
will be considered earned income.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to continuing qualifying for Roth contributions _ a
laudable goal _ you might find it worthwhile to take a part-time
job. Or, if you have the skills to earn money as a free-lancer or
independent contractor, that money, too, will count as earned
income.
</P>
<P>
   However, bear in mind that if you get carried away and earn a
substantial amount of money after retirement, you can lose part of
your Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   If you are less than 65 years old and drawing Social Security,
you can generate up to $9,600 of earned income per year without
affecting your benefits. But for every $2 you earn beyond that, you
will lose $1 in benefits, says Social Security Administration
spokeswoman Leslie Walker.
</P>
<P>
   If you are at least 65 years old but less than 70, you can earn
up to $15,500 on the side without reducing your Social Security
benefits. Beyond that, you lose $1 for every $3 you earn.
</P>
<P>
   Once you reach age 70, you can earn an unlimited amount without
suffering a Social Security penalty.

 Alza Introduces New Bladder-Control Drug  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
A biotech firm has launched a new bladder-control drug, setting up
a marketing battle against another new remedy that also targets
incontinence.
</P>
<P>
   Alza Corp. of Palo Alto said yesterday it has started selling
Ditropan XL, a new one-a-day formula to control weak bladders.
Ditropan XL will compete with Detrol, the incontinence remedy
released last spring by Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn Inc.
</P>
<P>
   For the one in 10 people over 65, mainly women, who suffer from
this embarrassing affliction, yesterday's news means there now are
two pills that claim to restore bladder control with fewer side
effects than previous remedies.
</P>
<P>
   For Alza shareholders, the marketing of Ditropan XL marks a
first. Alza is a 30-year-old firm that has made its living by
developing drug-delivery technologies _ like the NicoDerm patch _
and living off royalties from the firms that sold the actual drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first major product they've taken from start to
finish under their own name,'' said Alex Zisson with the New York
office of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. ``We're betting it won't be the
last.''
</P>
<P>
   Urologist Tim Boone with Baylor College of Medicine in Houston
said Ditropan XL is a new version of the Ditropan drug, which has
been around for 20 years. Ditropan calms the involuntary bladder
muscle contractions that cause frequent or unintentional urination.
</P>
<P>
   But regular Ditropan, taken three times a day, has enough side
effects _ dry mouth, constipation and blurry vision _ that four out
of five people quit using it, Boone said.
</P>
<P>
   Ditropan XL uses Alza's time-release formula to put a day's dose
into a single pill, releasing the drug slowly. In clinical trials,
this timed release relaxed the bladder with fewer side effects,
Boone said.
</P>
<P>
   Detrol, the competing incontinence medicine from Pharmacia, was
the first new drug in a decade to relax the bladder with fewer side
effects than conventional Ditropan. It is taken twice a day. Detrol
has generated more than $55 million in sales since Pharmacia of New
Jersey launched it in April.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Szabo, a urologist with Kaiser Permanente in San
Francisco said neither Alza nor Pharmacia has done the study that
would most benefit consumers _ a head-to-head comparison of
Ditropan XL against Detrol to see which drug offers the most
bladder control with the fewest side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, according to Jeanette Brown, an incontinence
researcher at the University of California at San Francisco Medical
Center, is that other companies are developing even newer drugs for
this bladder ailment.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of BLADDER0 (63441 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``The private market has realized that incontinence will only
grow as the population ages,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Zisson, the H&AMP;Q analyst, said Detrol and Ditropan XL both should
do well because doctors have nearly doubled the number of
prescriptions they are writing for incontinence remedies since the
new drugs appeared. He expects Ditropan XL to add upward of $50
million to Alza's revenues in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Alza gained 88 cents yesterday to close at $51.44. Last week,
the company reported year-end net income of $112 million ($1.26 per
share) on revenues of $584 million.

COMMENTARY: THE RULE OF LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ From the beginning, Republicans leading the effort to
drive President Clinton from office have spoken of the need to
sustain the rule of law. But the concerns of law, and of the
Constitution, have repeatedly been put aside for partisan ends.
</P>
<P>
   The latest example is the idea that the Senate adopt ``findings
of fact'' about the president's behavior before it votes on the
articles of impeachment. The ``findings'' would be, in one form of
words or another, that the president lied and impeded justice.
</P>
<P>
   The idea has two great attractions for Republicans. Such
findings, it is thought, would have more gravity _ and do more
damage to Clinton _ than a censure resolution adopted after the
Senate failed to convict on the impeachment articles. And,
crucially, those who support the proposal say that only a simple
majority instead of a two-thirds vote would be required.
</P>
<P>
   But the very attractiveness of the idea politically shows why it
is offensive constitutionally. The gravity of what was at stake led
the Framers of the Constitution to require a two-thirds vote of the
Senate to convict a president. This is essentially an attempt to
evade that requirement.
</P>
<P>
   George Will, the conservative commentator, gave the game away on
the ABC television program ``This Week.'' He spoke of a possible
Senate resolution that ``acknowledges, recognizes and accedes to
the articles of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   That would amount to the Senate convicting Clinton without
removing him from office. But the Constitution says the president
``shall be removed from office'' on impeachment and conviction.
Virtually no student of the Constitution thinks it allows a
two-stage Senate process.
</P>
<P>
   To try to get around the problem, some advocates of the idea
that the Senate make findings of facts say they should not be
phrased in legal terms. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said he
might be for a resolution if it did not ``find guilt according to
criminal law.''
</P>
<P>
   But if it quacks like a duck, it will be a duck. I think
Lieberman will conclude, on reflection, that something labeled
``findings'' will sound like _ and be intended to sound like _ a
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   There is another profound flaw in the proposal. It would have
the Senate come to conclusions without the fairness of the legal
fact-finding process.
</P>
<P>
   In court, facts are found on the basis of hard evidence, not the
surmise and conjecture that figure so prominently in the House
Republican managers' arguments for conviction. No legal trier of
fact, jury or judge, could properly convict on the evidence
presented in this case.
</P>
<P>
   In legal trials, moreover, the defendant has a full right to
call evidence on his behalf. The president's lawyers could call
witnesses now only at the risk of hurting their client _ and
offending the Senate _ by delaying the ending.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives are meant to have regard for history and for
institutions. No doubt it is naive of me, but I continue to be
surprised at how little heed is paid to those interests by those
who call themselves conservative today.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee, like other congressional
institutions, forbids partisan demonstrations at hearings. But
Henry Hyde and his Republican colleagues gave a standing ovation to
Kenneth Starr when he testified _ testimony so one-sided that
Starr's own ethics adviser, Sam Dash, resigned in protest.
</P>
<P>
   After losing five seats in November's election, Republican
leaders pushed impeachment through a lame-duck House. The second
article, on obstruction of justice, passed by just 221 to 212, so
the switch of those five seats would likely have meant its defeat
in the new House. Partisanship overrode respect for the democratic
process.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, despite talk of bipartisanship and concern for
the institution, vote after vote has been overwhelmingly along
partisan lines. My guess is that the same will happen when the
Senate decides whether to show the videotape of Monica Lewinsky's
deposition: anything to humiliate the president.
</P>
<P>
   The fact-finding idea is one more example of disregard for
fundamentals. What it effectively says is, ``But for the
inconvenience of the Constitution's impeachment clause ... ''

   Black and white churches merge
</P>
<P>
   By Glenn Evans
</P>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ A Longview congregation ignored centuries of
Christian division Sunday and agreed with a sister church that the
two assemblies should unite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vote is done in both churches, and that means there will
be a new church in Longview by the name of Wesley-McCabe United
Methodist Church,'' Don Meador said to applause and amens from the
members of McCabe United Methodist Church who had just voted to
merge with Wesley United Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Meador, district superintendent of the United Methodist Church,
said the merging of the predominantly black McCabe with the mostly
white Wesley would show the community the groups care more for
their religion than their race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we're poised to make a strong witness to our region
about what the church is and what the church must be,'' Meador
said, noting Sunday's Longview News-Journal editorial that included
the anticipated McCabe vote amid praise focused on the recent
hiring of the first blacks as Longview city manager and Longview
Independent School District superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are glad the community celebrates what is happening around
McCabe United Methodist Church, and especially at the start of
Black History Month,'' Meador said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Byron Boyett, pastor of Wesley United Methodist Church,
said last week a significant majority of his flock had approved the
measure the previous Sunday. That congregation, at 1115 S. Mobberly
Ave., had extended the invitation to unite as the McCabe church was
dealing with a crisis with its 102-year-old building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were fixing to have to move out of this building,'' said
the Rev. Mary High, pastor of McCabe. ``When they sent the
proposal, we answered it. Hopefully, we're going to have a joint
service next Sunday. That's Communion day, and we couldn't have a
better way to start it.''
</P>
<P>
   She and Meador said the new church will meet at the Wesley site.
Property of both churches becomes the property of the new entity,
Meador told the group of 10 before they filled in secret ballots.
</P>
<P>
   The merger is the third such recent action by predominantly
black and white congregations in the denomination's Texas
Conference, the others being in Beaumont and near Bryan.

BILL WOULD STRENGTHEN RIGHTS OF AIR PASSENGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., Ariz.)  (mk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Airlines would have to tell passengers when a
flight had been oversold, why a plane was late or a flight had been
canceled, and how many seats were available for passengers to buy
with frequent-flier miles, under a bill that two senators said they
planned to introduce this week.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also let consumers return tickets within 48 hours
of purchase, even ``nonrefundable'' ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airline profits are soaring, but often respect for basic
rights for the passengers is sinking,'' Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., one
of the bill's sponsors, said Monday in a telephone interview.
``These are the kinds of rules that the corner grocery store has to
comply with. The corner grocery store can't lure people in with
promise of a particular thing at a particular price, and then not
offer it.''
</P>
<P>
   The other sponsor is Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the
Senate Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would define a variety of common airline practices as
anti-competitive, which the Transportation Department has the
authority to stop.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the department could find airlines to be
anticompetitive and then fine them if they failed to ``disclose to
consumers information that would enable them to make informed
decisions about the comparative value of frequent-flier programs
among airlines, including the number of seats redeemable on each
flight.''
</P>
<P>
   David Fuscus, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, the
trade group of the major airlines, said he could not comment
because he had not seen the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines would also have to disclose all of their fares at a
consumer's request. If a flight did not take off as planned,
airlines would have to ``inform passengers of the factual reason
for the delay, cancellation or diversion of the flight to an
airport other than the scheduled stopover or destination.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also make legal a practice that the airlines call
``back-to-back ticketing,'' and have tried to block, in which a
passenger buys two round-trip tickets and throws away half of each,
because it is cheaper than buying a round-trip ticket for the days
the traveler wants to fly. It will also legalize what the industry
calls ``hidden cities,'' where a traveler buys a ticket to a
distant city but leaves the plane at an intermediate one, because
it is cheaper than buying a ticket to the real destination.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines contend that consumers have benefited from
deregulation and that any intervention by the government would mean
re-regulating them. They have also argued that under ``yield
management'' practices, they change the ticket prices for each
flight dozens of times in the months before the flight date. As a
result, the airlines say, answers about fares, or the number of
frequent-flier seats available, are accurate only temporarily.

UCLA GETS MONROVIA RUNNING BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK WELCH  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONROVIA, Calif. Monrovia High School running back Akil Harris
said Sunday that UCLA has been interested in his football talents
since ``early in my junior year.''
</P>
<P>
   That consistent persistence looks like it will pay off
Wednesday, as Harris said he will sign a national letter of intent
with the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, who gave the University of Colorado an oral commitment
in late December, had a change of heart after Colorado coach Rick
Neuheisel and running backs coach Kennedy Pola left the school for
the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaching change changed things,'' Harris said. ``But I can
tell you, if coach Pola was still there (in Colorado), I'd be a
Buffalo.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris said his decision to give UCLA a late oral commitment was
after much thought and discussion with his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really needed to sit back and kind of check myself,'' Harris
said. ``My family and I talked about it and we weighed everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think what it came down to was that I like UCLA, and the
fact that my parents and grandmother can come see me play.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris, who looked like a possible first-year starter if he
attended Colorado, is aware that the Bruins have a crowded
backfield returning. DeShaun Foster, Jermaine Lewis and Keith Brown
all saw significant playing time last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was being kind of selfish,'' Harris said. ``I guess I wanted
to go somewhere where I would, for sure, have an impact right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I can do the same at UCLA. I really think I'm going to be
on the field next year. I think I can contribute, even as a
tandem.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris took his fifth and final trip to UCLA last weekend, a
trip he said he wouldn't have taken if the Colorado coaching change
hadn't occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``UCLA has liked me all along and they've been very
understanding,'' Harris said. ``They haven't given me that
full-court press approach, where they back you into a wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``After my trip, UCLA sent me (via overnight delivery) a letter
of intent. They were the only school to do that. They told me,
`Take this and, if you change your mind on signing day (from
Colorado to UCLA), we'd love to have you.' Apparently, I'm the only
running back that they're recruiting.'' &UR; !dlim!!end! &LR;

 &HT;    Jury seated in East Texas murder case
 &HT;    By Janet Jacobs
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN AUGUSTINE, Texas _ After a full day of questions and
instruction, a jury was finally chosen Monday in the trial of
Berhardt Tiede II in San Augustine County. A jury and two
alternates was seated consisting of eight black women and six white
men.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the jury panel, nearly 100 people, were dismissed
just before 7 p.m., with the thanks of 123rd District Judge Guy
Griffin. Selection took so long, he said, because the panel had
been so honest in their answers to attorney's questions.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, Tiede sat with a serious expression, taking
notes and seldom making eye contact with the members of the jury
panel. He wore a dark blue suit and conservative striped tie.
</P>
<P>
   In the audience were his aunt and uncle, Millie and John Compton
of Lake Charles, La.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to come,'' Millie Compton said, tearing up, adding that
the family was still confused over the charges against Tiede.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always such a well-disciplined boy and easy to
discipline,'' she said. ``We just can't believe any of this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody can't just go completely wrong,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tiede, 40, is charged with murdering his elderly companion,
Marjorie Nugent, 81, and hiding her body in the freezer in her home
for nine months. He also is charged with theft over $200,000.
Prosecutors hope to prove that he stole hundreds of thousands of
dollars from her estate after her death and before his arrest in
August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In his confession, Tiede said he killed Nugent because she had
``become very possessive over my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The crime is alleged to have happened in Carthage, but an effort
to seat a Panola County jury failed last November, and the trial
was moved to San Augustine. The trial is expected to take three
weeks to hear.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecuting attorney, Panola County Criminal District
Attorney Danny Buck Davidson, was assisted in his choices of local
jurors by San Augustine District Attorney Charles Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   During jury selection, Davidson read aloud his list of 104
subpoenaed witnesses to see if potential jurors knew or were
related to them. Among the witnesses to be called in the trial are
several officers and employees of Longview Bank &AMP; Trust, where
Nugent had some accounts. Tiede and Nugent also traveled
extensively with the bank's Omni Club, which arranges tours and
trips both abroad and in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In his questioning of jurors, defense attorney Clifton
``Scrappy'' Holmes of Longview, suggested he would attempt to prove
Tiede's confession, given to a Panola County deputy and a Texas
Ranger, was taken improperly.
</P>
<P>
   Tiede was arrested after Nugent's son came to take possession of
his mother's Carthage home. Deputies discovered the body, with four
bullet holes in the back, in the freezer beneath some frozen
vegetables, wrapped in a sheet.
</P>
<P>
   The case has caused an uproar in Carthage because Tiede was
known as a popular and generous local businessman who was involved
in volunteer activities with Panola College, the Panola Chamber of
Commerce and the First United Methodist Church of Carthage, where
both he and Nugent were members.

ELWAY'S DECISION WILL TAKE SOME TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The first time is always special.
</P>
<P>
   But the Denver Broncos submit that it can be sweeter the second
time around.
</P>
<P>
   That was certainly their take in the aftermath of Sunday's 34-19
blasting of the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl XXXIII at Pro Player
Stadium, marking only the seventh time in NFL history that a team
has won back-to-back titles.
</P>
<P>
   This one might have meant more than their 31-24 upset victory
against the Packers in Super Bowl XXXII, partly because the blowout
gave the Broncos a chance to relish their accomplishment during the
game. And it might have meant more because the Broncos said the
road to the title was tougher because they expected to do it, and
as defending champion they were targets of hungry opponents all
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``After winning last year, we were going to get everyone's best
shot,'' Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said. ``Throughout the whole
year, that's how our team played.''
</P>
<P>
   And they seemed to play that way Sunday night, especially
38-year old quarterback John Elway, whose 336 yards passing were
the third-highest total in Super Bowl history. He walked off the
field _ and maybe out of the game forever _ with 50 seconds left in
the fourth quarter to a sea of flashing bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   Elway will consult his family, Shanahan and Broncos owner Pat
Bowlen about the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all week, and I said this year, that it's a 90
percent chance I'm going to quit,'' he said yesterday. ``But the
last thing I want to do is shut the door. I don't want to say that
I'm done, then get into March or April and say that I can play one
more year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to walk away too late. But I also know by the way
I played last night that I can still play.''
</P>
<P>
   If Elway comes back, the Broncos could become the first team in
NFL history to win three in a row. Elway, who likes the idea of
going out on top, said the challenge of doing something
unprecedented makes for an intriguing decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are things that I'm going to have to sit down and think
about,'' Elway said. ``It would be great to come back and
three-peat. But also it would be nice to walk away at the level I'm
playing at right now. There will be a bunch of things that go into
the decision, but at 38 years old and in the twilight of my career,
I want to focus on the now and not tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Broncos coach Mike Shanahan became the sixth coach in NFL
history to coach teams to back-to-back titles, joining Vince
Lombardi (Packers), Don Shula (Dolphins), Chuck Knoll (Steelers),
Jimmy Johnson (Cowboys) and Bill Walsh (49ers). He said he would
prefer for Elway to come back for the ``three-peat,'' but said he
would not pressure his quarterback, believing that Elway has had a
great career and deserves to go out on his own terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said before the game that my gut feeling is that John would
retire,'' Shanahan said. ``If he does retire, what a way to go out
_ the MVP, what he did last year and this year and what he did
throughout his career. But I'm hoping he will sit back and say `I'm
going to give it one more shot.' If he does come back, there won't
be a person with the team who won't be excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan, who joked to his team that off-season workouts will
start this week, believes the Broncos will do what it takes to put
themselves in position to win a third with or without Elway. He
said he would like a decision from Elway before the draft in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got a good shot,'' he said. ``We have our
nucleus coming back next season. That certainly can't hurt us.''

AFTER LONG JOURNEY, FRANCIS FINDS HOME, SUCCESS

<P>
   COLLEGE PARK, Md. _ Reality and absurdity double-teamed Steve
Francis soon after he started classes at the University of
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   He was walking across campus, Walkman headphones in place,
trying to be a ``regular student'' when another student, high-beam
smile in place, stepped in front of Francis. Before they could
shake hands, the worshipful stranger dropped to his knees to praise
the human shrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too much, I was overwhelmed by what people were
expecting,'' said Francis, a 6-3, 190-pound guard. ``The pressure
has been here since I decided to come here. I just expected myself
to play like I can play. I wanted to fit in with the team. I was
worried about how the guys would accept me.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis has a better grasp of reality than most 20-year-old
basketball players who are regarded as saviors of a program. His
presence on Maryland's team has fans thinking Final Four and has
NBA scouts thinking No. 1 draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, bombastic coach Lefty Driesell said he wanted
to make Maryland the ``UCLA of the East.'' But before or since,
Maryland has never reached a Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   With Francis joining a veteran team that reached the Sweet 16
last season, Terrapins fans began thinking this could be their
year.
</P>
<P>
   His pre-Maryland reputation was hearsay because of a limited
high school career and two different junior-college stops. Francis'
frequent moves could indicate a checkered past; instead, it's one
of tragic circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   On his right bicep is a tattoo that Francis rubs before he
shoots a free throw. It's a cross with the name ``Brenda'' and the
words ``In memory.'' Brenda Francis, Steve's mother, died of cancer
in 1995. A senior in high school, Francis said he was ``paralyzed''
for five or six months after her death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always thinking about what it would be like if she could
come watch me play,'' said Francis, whose father left when Steve
was 6. ``Maybe the story wouldn't be as dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis has posted modest numbers for the No. 7 Terrapins. He is
averaging 16.6 points, 4.2 rebounds and 4.7 assists per game for
19-3 Maryland, which plays at No. 2 Duke tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   He has blended himself into the lineup in his first season as a
shooting guard, not a point guard, although he's averaging just
over 11 shots per game and is second on the team in assists.
</P>
<P>
   And his ability to make plays _ in coaching parlance, break down
the defense _ is why Francis' reputation preceded him.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what defense the other team is playing, a guard who
can penetrate is going to cause you problems,'' Maryland coach Gary
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people expected him to take 30 shots a game and do
crazy things. But his game is fundamentally sound. He's just a
great player. You want him to play a team game and he does that
more than anyone expected. But when he can, we want him to
explode.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season at Maryland games, before he had even stepped on
campus, Terrapins fans chanted ``We want Francis.'' They got him
when Francis chose Maryland over Clemson. It was an easy choice;
Francis is a home boy. His Takoma Park home is about three miles
from Cole Field House.
</P>
<P>
   Renowned for his athletic play and 43-inch vertical leap,
Francis could have become an ``urban playground legend''
(translation: basketball talent wasted by circumstances). After his
mother's death, he left a Connecticut prep school and his
basketball career nearly ended. Dale Lamberth, his high school
coach, thought Francis was going to be ``a superstar in the
ghetto.'' Though he never got in any serious trouble, he admits he
was hanging with the wrong people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was mad at the world for awhile,'' said Francis, who turns
21 Feb. 21. ``I've learned a lot of things guys my age won't learn.
But I've always kept my faith alive. And on the court, I think it's
made me more patient. When I get on the court, it's my chance to
get away and relax.''
</P>
<P>
   A spectacular showing in 1996 at a national AAU tournament led
Francis to San Jacinto Junior College, which he led to the national
championship game. Homesick, Francis transferred to Allegany
Community College in Western Maryland. He led the Trojans to the
national title game and was a JUCO All-American.
</P>
<P>
   The praise has stacked up like Bill Gates' money. Teammate
Obinna Ekezie says Francis is the best one-on-one player in the
country. Maryland point guard Terrell Stokes says Francis always
plays his ``A'' game. NBA player Chris Webber says Francis' game
has ``spice and brains.'' NBA scouts have said Francis is Allen
Iverson with discipline.
</P>
<P>
   And, especially considering his Marco Polo past, there has been
much speculation that Francis will leave for the NBA after this
season. Recently, ESPN aired, but later retracted, a report that
Francis had said this will be his last season here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It upset me a lot,'' Francis said. ``My friends were saying,
`Wow, are you outta here?' That decision has to come from me and it
didn't. It was something somebody wanted to say. People can do
anything to try to take you down. It makes you want to get into a
shell.''
</P>
<P>
   March 21 will be the four-year anniversary of Brenda Francis's
death. It will also be the day this year's Final Four will be set
after finals at the East and Midwest regions. If Francis and his
teammates are then headed for Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg,
Fla., well. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think that in order to be considered a good player, you
have to win,'' Francis said. ``That's what it all comes down to. I
know the Final Four is what a lot of people around here are
thinking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about my mom every day. I'm trying to make her proud
of me, on and off the court.''

BAD VOTE, BAD OFFER TARNISH SUPER SHOW

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The Monday-morning-after-Super-Bowl blues
and views:
</P>
<P>
   Those ultra-provincial New York football writers and columnists
who were fighting mad that anyone would dare question the right of
Lawrence Taylor to be a first-ballot inductee into the Pro Football
Hall of Fame must be very proud of their man after he maliciously
ripped into those who didn't make him a unanimous selection
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor did a rambling, mumbling, scowl-filled TV interview that
again showed no remorse for his litany of drug arrests and
post-career misbehavior and accused the writers who voted against
him of ``getting high on their third or fourth highball ... and
they'll go here to South Beach, get totally trashed and chase some
little 13-year-old up and down the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, a real Hall of Famer, that L.T. He was great on Sundays
but what, the other six days of the week don't count? If he had
played anywhere but New York, he'd have to buy a ticket to get into
the Hall of Fame, just like you and me. ...
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I know those ``old phonies'' who voted against him, and
they don't have either the energy or the inclination to chase an
ice-cream cart up and down the street, much less a teen-ager. ...
</P>
<P>
   Taylor says he didn't like it that anyone would feel that his
name should have an asterisk by it in the Hall of Fame. The only
asterisk there is the one he has attached himself, but it is a
doozy. ...
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, Taylor's diatribe also embarrassed NFL commissioner
Paul Tagliabue, who openly stumped for Taylor's admission. The
commissioner has no business campaigning for anyone unless he
intends to do so for every legitimate candidate on the ballot.
Where were you when Bob Hayes needed you, Mr. Commish? If Hayes had
played in New York, would he be in the Hall right now? ...
</P>
<P>
   Poor Dan Reeves. He must have known on the spot that it wasn't
going to be his day Sunday when he received word that starting
safety Eugene Robinson had been arrested for soliciting oral sex
from an undercover police officer. That Robinson's wife, kids and
father were in town for the game gives a whole new meaning to the
``Dirty Bird.''...
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a difference between righteous and innocent,''
Robinson said afterward. ``And I wasn't righteous.'' Say what? ...
</P>
<P>
   Best line on Robinson came from WFAA/Channel 8's Dale Hansen on
Sunday night as he showed highlights of John Elway's 80-yard
touchdown pass to Rod Smith, who ran by Robinson on the play.
``Maybe,'' Hansen smirked, ``he should have offered \RSmith\S $40
to stop.'' Ouch. ...
</P>
<P>
   It's lines like that _ I guess _ that just helped Hansen be
elected Texas broadcaster of the year by the National Association
of Broadcasters and Sports Writers. ...
</P>
<P>
   What do you suppose hurt Reeves most, that quadruple-bypass
surgery he had less than two months ago or the collective pain of
losing his fourth Super Bowl? Having been through the former, I'm
still betting on the latter. Hey, not many coaches have even had a
chance to lose four Super Bowls. ...
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. Would somebody remind me again what a great season Chris
Chandler had? ...
</P>
<P>
   John Elway's postgame comments about the victory ``throwing a
kink'' into things makes it sound like he was leaning toward
retirement. Suggestion to Elway: Take some time, think things
through, then go ahead and hang 'em up. Coming back to try to
become the first to win three in a row may sound enticing, but as
we know from experience around here, it's a lot easier said than
done.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to keep players who already own two rings, with
all the glory and money that goes along with that, hungry enough to
make the sacrifices necessary to win a third. Elway deserves to
ride the glory into the sunset rather than risk walking off the
field a loser in his last game. ...
</P>
<P>
   There were a lot of stars on the field Sunday, but one player
sticks out in my mind and surprisingly, it's not Elway, Terrell
Davis or Jamal Anderson. It's Falcons' kick returner and wideout
Tim Dwight, who returned one kick 94-yards for a touchdown and
almost broke a couple of others. He can fly. ...
</P>
<P>
   Updating note to Norm Hitzges: Teams with animal nicknames _
Colts, Dolphins, Broncos, Rams, Eagles, Bengals, Bears, Falcons _
making their first Super Bowl appearances now 1-7. A trend to
watch.

ELWAY'S DECISION WILL TAKE SOME TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The first time is always special.
</P>
<P>
   But the Denver Broncos submit that it can be sweeter the second
time around.
</P>
<P>
   That was certainly their take in the aftermath of Sunday's 34-19
blasting of the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl XXXIII at Pro Player
Stadium, marking only the seventh time in NFL history that a team
has won back-to-back titles.
</P>
<P>
   This one might have meant more than their 31-24 upset victory
against the Packers in Super Bowl XXXII, partly because the blowout
gave the Broncos a chance to relish their accomplishment during the
game. And it might have meant more because the Broncos said the
road to the title was tougher because they expected to do it, and
as defending champion they were targets of hungry opponents all
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``After winning last year, we were going to get everyone's best
shot,'' Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said. ``Throughout the whole
year, that's how our team played.''
</P>
<P>
   And they seemed to play that way Sunday night, especially
38-year old quarterback John Elway, whose 336 yards passing were
the third-highest total in Super Bowl history. He walked off the
field _ and maybe out of the game forever _ with 50 seconds left in
the fourth quarter to a sea of flashing bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   Elway will consult his family, Shanahan and Broncos owner Pat
Bowlen about the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all week, and I said this year, that it's a 90
percent chance I'm going to quit,'' he said yesterday. ``But the
last thing I want to do is shut the door. I don't want to say that
I'm done, then get into March or April and say that I can play one
more year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to walk away too late. But I also know by the way
I played last night that I can still play.''
</P>
<P>
   If Elway comes back, the Broncos could become the first team in
NFL history to win three in a row. Elway, who likes the idea of
going out on top, said the challenge of doing something
unprecedented makes for an intriguing decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are things that I'm going to have to sit down and think
about,'' Elway said. ``It would be great to come back and
three-peat. But also it would be nice to walk away at the level I'm
playing at right now. There will be a bunch of things that go into
the decision, but at 38 years old and in the twilight of my career,
I want to focus on the now and not tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Broncos coach Mike Shanahan became the sixth coach in NFL
history to coach teams to back-to-back titles, joining Vince
Lombardi (Packers), Don Shula (Dolphins), Chuck Knoll (Steelers),
Jimmy Johnson (Cowboys) and Bill Walsh (49ers). He said he would
prefer for Elway to come back for the ``three-peat,'' but said he
would not pressure his quarterback, believing that Elway has had a
great career and deserves to go out on his own terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said before the game that my gut feeling is that John would
retire,'' Shanahan said. ``If he does retire, what a way to go out
_ the MVP, what he did last year and this year and what he did
throughout his career. But I'm hoping he will sit back and say `I'm
going to give it one more shot.' If he does come back, there won't
be a person with the team who won't be excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan, who joked to his team that off-season workouts will
start this week, believes the Broncos will do what it takes to put
themselves in position to win a third with or without Elway. He
said he would like a decision from Elway before the draft in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got a good shot,'' he said. ``We have our
nucleus coming back next season. That certainly can't hurt us.''

<P>
   COLLEGE PARK, Md. _ Reality and absurdity double-teamed Steve
Francis soon after he started classes at the University of
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   He was walking across campus, Walkman headphones in place,
trying to be a ``regular student'' when another student, high-beam
smile in place, stepped in front of Francis. Before they could
shake hands, the worshipful stranger dropped to his knees to praise
the human shrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too much, I was overwhelmed by what people were
expecting,'' said Francis, a 6-3, 190-pound guard. ``The pressure
has been here since I decided to come here. I just expected myself
to play like I can play. I wanted to fit in with the team. I was
worried about how the guys would accept me.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis has a better grasp of reality than most 20-year-old
basketball players who are regarded as saviors of a program. His
presence on Maryland's team has fans thinking Final Four and has
NBA scouts thinking No. 1 draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, bombastic coach Lefty Driesell said he wanted
to make Maryland the ``UCLA of the East.'' But before or since,
Maryland has never reached a Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   With Francis joining a veteran team that reached the Sweet 16
last season, Terrapins fans began thinking this could be their
year.
</P>
<P>
   His pre-Maryland reputation was hearsay because of a limited
high school career and two different junior-college stops. Francis'
frequent moves could indicate a checkered past; instead, it's one
of tragic circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   On his right bicep is a tattoo that Francis rubs before he
shoots a free throw. It's a cross with the name ``Brenda'' and the
words ``In memory.'' Brenda Francis, Steve's mother, died of cancer
in 1995. A senior in high school, Francis said he was ``paralyzed''
for five or six months after her death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always thinking about what it would be like if she could
come watch me play,'' said Francis, whose father left when Steve
was 6. ``Maybe the story wouldn't be as dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis has posted modest numbers for the No. 7 Terrapins. He is
averaging 16.6 points, 4.2 rebounds and 4.7 assists per game for
19-3 Maryland, which plays at No. 2 Duke tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   He has blended himself into the lineup in his first season as a
shooting guard, not a point guard, although he's averaging just
over 11 shots per game and is second on the team in assists.
</P>
<P>
   And his ability to make plays _ in coaching parlance, break down
the defense _ is why Francis' reputation preceded him.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what defense the other team is playing, a guard who
can penetrate is going to cause you problems,'' Maryland coach Gary
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people expected him to take 30 shots a game and do
crazy things. But his game is fundamentally sound. He's just a
great player. You want him to play a team game and he does that
more than anyone expected. But when he can, we want him to
explode.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season at Maryland games, before he had even stepped on
campus, Terrapins fans chanted ``We want Francis.'' They got him
when Francis chose Maryland over Clemson. It was an easy choice;
Francis is a home boy. His Takoma Park home is about three miles
from Cole Field House.
</P>
<P>
   Renowned for his athletic play and 43-inch vertical leap,
Francis could have become an ``urban playground legend''
(translation: basketball talent wasted by circumstances). After his
mother's death, he left a Connecticut prep school and his
basketball career nearly ended. Dale Lamberth, his high school
coach, thought Francis was going to be ``a superstar in the
ghetto.'' Though he never got in any serious trouble, he admits he
was hanging with the wrong people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was mad at the world for awhile,'' said Francis, who turns
21 Feb. 21. ``I've learned a lot of things guys my age won't learn.
But I've always kept my faith alive. And on the court, I think it's
made me more patient. When I get on the court, it's my chance to
get away and relax.''
</P>
<P>
   A spectacular showing in 1996 at a national AAU tournament led
Francis to San Jacinto Junior College, which he led to the national
championship game. Homesick, Francis transferred to Allegany
Community College in Western Maryland. He led the Trojans to the
national title game and was a JUCO All-American.
</P>
<P>
   The praise has stacked up like Bill Gates' money. Teammate
Obinna Ekezie says Francis is the best one-on-one player in the
country. Maryland point guard Terrell Stokes says Francis always
plays his ``A'' game. NBA player Chris Webber says Francis' game
has ``spice and brains.'' NBA scouts have said Francis is Allen
Iverson with discipline.
</P>
<P>
   And, especially considering his Marco Polo past, there has been
much speculation that Francis will leave for the NBA after this
season. Recently, ESPN aired, but later retracted, a report that
Francis had said this will be his last season here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It upset me a lot,'' Francis said. ``My friends were saying,
`Wow, are you outta here?' That decision has to come from me and it
didn't. It was something somebody wanted to say. People can do
anything to try to take you down. It makes you want to get into a
shell.''
</P>
<P>
   March 21 will be the four-year anniversary of Brenda Francis's
death. It will also be the day this year's Final Four will be set
after finals at the East and Midwest regions. If Francis and his
teammates are then headed for Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg,
Fla., well. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think that in order to be considered a good player, you
have to win,'' Francis said. ``That's what it all comes down to. I
know the Final Four is what a lot of people around here are
thinking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about my mom every day. I'm trying to make her proud
of me, on and off the court.''

 No. 1 CONNECTICUT IS UPSET AT HOME BY SYRACUSE, 59-42 
 ( ms ) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Get well soon. Real soon. That is the message
the University of Connecticut basketball team should scream outside
the dormitory rooms of Richard Hamilton and Jake Voskuhl after the
Huskies tumbled and stumbled to Syracuse, 59-42, without their two
injured starters Monday night. As Hamilton and Voskuhl watched from
the bench, UConn's chance for an undefeated season fizzled away in
emphatic fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies had been ranked first in the country over the last
10 weeks, but they looked bewildered without Hamilton and Voskuhl
and saw their chance for an undefeated season squashed by the
16th-ranked Orangemen. In addition to pinning the first defeat on
the Huskies (19-1 overall, 11-1 in the Big East), Syracuse (16-6,
7-5) also ended UConn's 31-game home winning streak by humiliating
the cold-shooting, poor-passing Huskies. The paltry point total
matched UConn's lowest ever in a Big East game, equaling its total
against Georgetown in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange did it behind Damone Brown, a player who took one
shot in the first half and then erupted for 14 in the second half
as Syracuse played under control and then cruised. The normally
raucous Connecticut fans were stunned. Simple tasks like running a
half court offense, boxing out and draining eight-foot jumpers were
serious obstacles for UConn, obstacles that the Huskies never
overcame at the Hartford Civic Center. If this had been a
Connecticut practice, Coach Jim Calhoun would have blown a whistle
and forced his team to run sprints. It was that bad. The Huskies
missed 29 of 45 shots from the field and made 18 turnovers, but
Calhoun could not stop it. It continued on and on for 40 ugly
minutes. So, even before the Huskies travel to the West Coast for a
matchup against third-ranked Stanford next Saturday, they will
almost definitely relinquish their top-ranking in the next poll.
Without the smooth Hamilton as a weapon from the outside or the
6-foot-11-inch Voskuhl clogging the middle, the Huskies looked and
played like a very mortal team.
</P>
<P>
   After Kevin Freeman muscled inside to give the Huskies a 27-25
lead early in the second half, their first since the score was 2-0,
the Orange methodically scored 10 points in a row to snatch an
eight-point lead and silence the fans. Brown had four points during
the streak and UConn, which had to rely too heavily on either the
erratic Khalid El-Amin or players who are not accustomed to being
so involved in the offense for points, wilted, never getting closer
than seven points for the rest of the game. El-Amin was 2 for 12
from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game even started, fans of the Huskies spotted an odd
and potentially troubling sight on Connecticut's bench because
Hamilton and Voskuhl were not in their familiar red, white and blue
home uniforms. The two juniors have been mainstays for the Huskies
for three seasons so it was strange to see them slumped in chairs
while wearing sport coats. Freeman, another starter, played with a
bruised left thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, who is Connecticut's leading scorer with an average of
22.1 points a game, missed the second game of his career, while
Voskuhl, the team's leading rebounder with 7.2 a game, missed his
first game ever. Both players injured themselves in UConn's 78-74
victory over St. John's last Saturday, but the extent of the
injuries was not realized until Monday. Voskuhl did not practice on
Sunday and Hamilton was unable to run.
</P>
<P>
   While Hamilton is described as day to day with a contusion on
his right thigh, the possible return date for Voskuhl is more
confusing. Voskuhl had a bone scan performed Monday at the UConn
Medical Center in Farmington and it showed a stress fracture of his
left foot, which is a recurrence of an injury he had in high
school. Coach Jim Calhoun spoke ominously about his 6-foot-11-inch
center's status.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be very, very cautious,'' said Calhoun. ``I don't
like the signs. He has had foot problems before. If this is a
long-term thing, it's certainly not the news we wanted to get.''
</P>
<P>
   The lineup of Hamilton, Voskuhl, Freeman, Khalid El-Amin and
Ricky Moore had not been disrupted since Jan. 24, 1998, a streak of
36 games. During that stretch, the Huskies were 34-2. Without
Hamilton and Voskuhl, the Huskies started Souleymane Wane at center
and Rashamel Jones at forward. But Calhoun frantically looked for a
unit that could play cohesively by making four substitutions in the
first four minutes. The coach kept looking all night.
</P>
<P>
   Other than a frenetic spurt in which the Huskies scored six
points in the final 47 seconds to even the score 25-25, the first
half was a brutal display. The teams combined for 20 turnovers and
18 field goals, a revealing statistic. UConn shot 32 percent from
the field and made five of 10 free throws while Syracuse sank 39
percent of its shots and was also five of 10 from the line. It was
supposed to be a marquee matchup, but it was hardly gaudy for the
first 20 minutes and then it was only glorious in the end for
Syracuse.

FOCUS TURNS TO VERNON JORDAN AND DIFFERING ACCOUNTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also IMPEACH) 
(lb) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After questioning Monica Lewinsky for several
hours, the House managers will turn their attention on Tuesday to
Vernon Jordan and how his account differs from hers over a sworn
affidavit in which she denied a sexual relationship with President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who will be the second witness deposed by the House
managers, will be questioned largely about his role in getting Ms.
Lewinsky to file the affidavit in January 1998 in the Paula Jones
sexual harassment case, and about his efforts to help Ms. Lewinsky
get a job around the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers have said they wanted to have Jordan as a
witness to bolster the second article of impeachment against the
president, which charges a wide-ranging scheme of obstruction of
justice. Under their theory, Jordan helped orchestrate an effort to
have Ms. Lewinsky file the affidavit, which they say Jordan knew
was false. Jordan has denied that he tried to influence her
affidavit or helped her in the job search to buy her cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky testified before the grand jury in detail last year
about conversations she said she had with Jordan in which she made
it clear that she had an intimate relationship with Clinton. She
provided a host of details about their conversations, which the
House managers believe reinforce her version of events.
</P>
<P>
   But in his grand jury appearances, Jordan testified that he
could not recall that she ever told him of her affair with the
president before it became known publicly, and, in some instances,
could not even recall some of the meetings about which she
testified. His grand jury testimony is replete with assertions that
he was unable to remember the content of conversations, not only
with Ms. Lewinsky but also with Clinton and Betty Currie, the
president's secretary.
</P>
<P>
   One incident Jordan is likely to be asked about is Ms.
Lewinsky's account of a conversation in which he suggested to her
that she destroy any notes she had written to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   By Ms. Lewinsky's account, that conversation occurred over
breakfast at the Park Hyatt Hotel in Washington on Dec. 31, 1997.
Until then, she said she had concealed from Jordan and Clinton her
fear that her one-time friend Linda Tripp was disclosing her
confidences about her relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky testified that she told Jordan over a breakfast of
an egg-white omelet that Mrs. Tripp had been at her apartment and
might have seen notes she had written to Clinton. She testified
that Jordan told her, ``Go home and make sure they're not there.''
She then said that she went home and discarded a handful of drafts
and copies of notes she had written to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., the House manager who will be
Jordan's principal questioner, said over the weekend, ``I think
that's an area that needs to be explored with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has testified that he cannot recall ever having breakfast
with Ms. Lewinsky in the Park Hyatt. But the independent counsel
Kenneth Starr has said that circumstantial evidence, including a
restaurant receipt for Ms. Lewinsky's omelet, led him to believe
that the meeting occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has depicted his efforts to help Ms. Lewinsky file an
affidavit as minimal and his role in doing so as that of a
disinterested and distant acquaintance. He has portrayed his help
in her job search as based on a generalized inclination to help a
talented young woman and not as an effort to prevent her from
disclosing her intimate relationship with the president.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For the White House lawyers, one statement of Ms. Lewinsky's has
served as an all-purpose shield: She has said that no one asked to
her lie and that she was not promised a job in return for anything.
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Lewinsky's version, she first unmistakably informed
Jordan that her relationship with Clinton was intimate on Dec. 22
when they were conferring about getting her a job. In that
conversation, she said she told Jordan that she and the president
engaged in phone sex, which she defined for him as having a
telephone conversation in which each aroused the other.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers assert that the job search ``intensified''
after Ms. Lewinsky appeared on a list of possible witnesses in the
Jones case on Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 8, she had a job interview that was set up by Jordan.
When she reported to him that it did not go well, Jordan called
Ronald Perelman, the chairman of MacAndrews &AMP; Forbes Holding, the
company that controls Revlon Inc., and arranged for her to be
reinterviewed, after which she was offered a job at Revlon in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers have attacked the theory that the job help
was a reward to buy Ms. Lewinsky's silence. They have noted that
her efforts to find a job in New York began months earlier. They
say she had even met with Jordan in November, before her name
turned up on the Jones witness list.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts of Ms. Lewinsky and Jordan are also at odds over
whether he took a detailed interest in the affidavit's contents.
Jordan said he helped her find a lawyer and then said he had little
role in the affidavit. Ms. Lewinsky said Jordan helped her fashion
the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   While the House managers have said everyone knew that any
affidavit denying a sexual relationship had to be false, White
House lawyers have argued that Ms. Lewinsky could have believed it
to be true. They point to her taped conversation with Mrs. Tripp in
which she said that oral sex did not constitute sexual relations,
which she said she believed could only be defined by intercourse. l

AXA OF FRANCE TO BUY GUARDIAN OF BRITAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AXA Group of France, one of the world's largest insurance and
financial-services companies, said Monday that it had agreed to buy
Guardian Royal Exchange PLC for $5.68 billion, greatly expanding
its auto and homeowner business in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, through its Sun Life and Provincial Holdings
subsidiary, will make AXA No. 3 in Britain's property and casualty
insurance business, up from 10th. It will also fortify its No. 3
ranking in life insurance and give it the No. 2 position in health
insurance, a new field for AXA in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the deal gives the French giant a corporate insurance
unit in Germany to bolster its subsidiary there, AXA Colonia,
Gerard de la Martiniere, AXA's chief financial officer, said in an
interview from Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, de la Martiniere said, fills several important gaps in
AXA's lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important for us to have a strong position in the
main markets of Europe _ the U.K., Germany and France,'' he said.
``To be efficient and profitable, you have to be among the leaders
in every market. If you are a follower, you can't really make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that AXA, with revenue of $62 billion last year, was
considering more acquisitions, possibly in Latin America and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Guardian Royal's profits have been declining for several years,
and its share price is down considerably from a year ago. But in
paying about 5 percent more than Guardian Royal's market value, de
la Martiniere said he thought AXA had gotten a bargain. And that,
he said, is what AXA seeks in acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally speaking, we try to avoid situations where everybody
is bidding,'' he said. ``It leads to huge prices. We prefer shaken
companies with potential for recovery. It is more in line with our
track record to get quick and sharp improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal on Monday, AXA will sell Guardian Royal's
property-casualty business in the United States to Liberty Mutual
Group in Boston for $1.47 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty, the leading provider of workers' compensation coverage,
will add 20 companies, from Albany Insurance Co. of New York to
Tower Insurance Co. in Pewaukee, Wis., increasing its regional
corporate as well auto and homeowner businesses. Besides its
domestic operations, Liberty, which had sales of $5.9 billion last
year, does business in 13 countries in Latin America, Britain and
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``AXA is becoming the major consolidator in Europe,'' said
Martin Mills, a senior analyst at Moody's Investors Service in
London, citing AXA's acquisition of its French rival UAP in 1996
and its purchase last year of the stake in Royale Belge Insurance
in Belgium that it did not already own. AXA has owned 60 percent of
Equitable Cos., the New York life insurance and financial-services
company, for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   AXA agreed to pay 389 pence, or about $6.40, a share for
Guardian Royal, a 5 percent premium over the company's closing
price on Friday and 41 percent more than its closing price in
mid-November, when Guardian Royal said it was looking for a buyer.
The deal will be mainly in cash, with AXA paying 249 pence plus
0.243 share for each share of Guardian Royal.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Analysts said there were several reasons that Guardian Royal
sold for close to its market value. Not only have profits in the
property-casualty business generally been depressed but the pool of
potential buyers has shrunk as several other large insurers have
recently merged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the other large players are busy digesting recent
mergers,'' Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   AXA outbid two other companies that had been negotiating for
Guardian Royal: Royal and Sun Life Insurance Group in Britain, and
Eureko, a company formed by seven European insurers.
</P>
<P>
   AXA executives said that part of their plan for Guardian Royal
was to save millions of dollars in costs. But some analysts were
skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guardian has already been doing a lot of things to improve
efficiency and reduce costs,'' said Rafael Villarreal, another
analyst at Moody's in London.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor inhibiting cost-cutting in Britain, Villarreal
said, is that the property-casualty business AXA is buying is much
larger than its holdings in Sun Life. It thus does not have a
structure into which it can fold the new business, but instead will
need to fit the Sun Life property and casualty business into the
larger operation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One likely cost reduction, de la Martiniere said, will come at
the headquarters of Guardian Royal. The running of Guardian Royal's
units in South Africa, Asia, Latin America and Germany will be
shifted to other AXA units. ``As soon as we free the U.K. business
from these costs, we will have significant savings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Guardian Royal has been losing money through its calculation of
risk and pricing, de la Martiniere said. And AXA hopes to reverse
that. ``We have some skill in running property-casualty insurance
companies in competitive markets, especially France,'' he said.
``And we have been making money even when market cycles are
relatively poor.''

TRAVEL BRIEFS: PICASSO AND MATISSE, SIDE BY SIDE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the time they met in 1906, Picasso and Matisse were
fiercely competitive, and ``Matisse and Picasso: A Gentle
Rivalry,'' which opened last Sunday at the Kimbell Art Museum in
Fort Worth, Texas, is the first major exhibition to examine their
sparring. It brings together more than 100 paintings, drawings and
sculptures from around the world, juxtaposing many for the first
time. The show, which runs through May 2, will not travel.
</P>
<P>
   Arranged chronologically, the exhibit picks up the rivalry
around 1930, with Matisse recovering from a bout of artist's block,
while Picasso was enjoying a highly productive period, even teasing
his rival with parodies of his odalisques, dancers, studio scenes
and other paintings.
</P>
<P>
   In 1930, Matisse began working again, and Picasso, apparently
fascinated by a Matisse retrospective and an exhibition of his
sculptures, represented in this show by works like ``Jeannette
III,'' responded with sculptures of heads and bathers and his
``sleeping beauty'' canvases, like ``Woman with Yellow Hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Matisse then rose to the challenge with such paintings as ``The
Dream'' from 1935, prompting Picasso's gradual mellowing toward the
decorative aspects of Matisse's work. By the end of the 1930s, the
two observed a truce, with each exploring the other's pictorial
language in his own terms.
</P>
<P>
   During the war years, they exchanged some paintings and
drawings, most of which will be on view. In peace, the two began to
meet often and exhibit together, producing works like Matisse's
``Blue Nude II'' (1952) and ``Seated Woman'' by Picasso (1953).
Finally, following Matisse's death in 1954, Picasso began to
reinvent his colleague, painting elegies _ first, thematic works
like ``Women of Algiers'' and then a series of empty studios
reminiscent of Matisse's Vence interiors.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimbell, at 3333 Camp Bowie Blvd., Fort Worth, is open daily
except Monday. Timed advance-purchase tickets for $8 are
recommended. Call: (800) 654-9545. Same-day tickets, also $8, are
available at the museum on a first-come, first-served basis.

   A SPANISH PEAK JOINS A NATIONAL PARK &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the fabled Alhambra in Granada have always been able
to gaze at the distant snowcapped Veleta Peak, which at 11,129 feet
rises as a breathtaking backdrop to the medieval Moorish complex.
Now, Veleta has become part of the new Sierra Nevada National Park,
a 213,790-acre nature preserve whose main western entrance is a
30-minute drive from Granada. The park contains 14 peaks above
9,600 feet, the tallest being Mulhacen, at 11,421 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Nevada is a Mediterranean mountainous zone that
already enjoyed some official environmental protection and now will
get more after Parliament approved it last month as the 12th, and
largest, national park in Spain. It has 2,100 species of fauna and
flora, including vast forests of pine, oak, chestnut and maple, and
rare plants such as an indigenous narcissus. Some 100 miles of
marked trails are open daily during daylight. Admission is free,
but the park management recommends that visits deep inside the park
be led by local guides (about $71 to $106 a day, at 141 pesetas to
the dollar).
</P>
<P>
   The easiest access from Granada is on Highway 395 toward the
Sierra Nevada ski resort at Prado Llano. The park's Dornajo
information center is on this road at kilometer 23. One can enter
the park there, or drive 30 minutes more along the same road to the
Hoya de la Mora parking area, closer to the base of Veleta Peak.
The Dornajo center is open daily from 10 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and 4:30
to 7 p.m. (until 8 in summer). Information: (34) 958-340-625.

   CIVIL RIGHTS SITES MAPPED ON THE WEB &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A new historical itinerary with maps and photos tracing events
in the civil rights movement has been introduced on the Web. From
photos of Sammy Davis Jr. and the Moulin Rouge, an integrated hotel
and theater opened in Las Vegas in 1955, to the home in Daytona
Beach, Fla., of the Rev. Howard Thurman, whose book was a mainstay
for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the site describes and
shows 42 places in 21 states.
</P>
<P>
   The itinerary, ``We Shall Overcome: Historic Places of the Civil
Rights Movement,'' is found at www.cr.nps.gov/nr. It was prepared
by the National Park Service, the Federal Highway Administration
and the National Conference of State Historic Preservation
Officers. Many of the buildings on the itinerary are on the
National Register of Historic Places, but some are gone, and some
that remain are not open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Printed out, the text and pictures become a guidebook for
exploration of a turbulent period and its antecedents.

</P>
<P>
   Stock prices finished mixed after investors chose to take some
profits in late trading, but bond prices posted the biggest drop in
almost three months as several economic reports pointed to
resilience in the U.S. economy, leaving investors little incentive

 &HT;    Georgia Legislature: '99 session looking for an identity
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ To define itself, a legislative session needs face
books and a good fight. Neither having arrived yet, this session
remains pretty much a blank sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Face books are those little booklets made available by the House
and Senate information offices that put a face beside the name of
every legislator along with some basic facts. Without the face
books, which are expected any day now, the first-term lawmakers are
hard to keep up with. More detailed information is nowadays
available on the Web, but you can't tuck that in your coat pocket
or purse.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting to thumb through a decade or so of face books
to get a sense of how not only race and gender but occupations have
changed over time.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1987-88 face book, 11 of the 56 state senators _ all but
one of them Democrats _ listed their occupation as attorney. There
were two funeral home directors and a retired veterinarian, but no
physicians.
</P>
<P>
   This year, eight senators listed lawyering as their trade,
including four Republicans and three first-term Democrats. That
there is only one Democratic lawyer with experience in the chamber,
Sen. Rene Kemp of Hinesville, marks a huge change from the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   What has been given up by the legal profession has been taken up
by the medical field. This year the Senate has three Republican
doctors _ Minority Whip Tom Price of Roswell, Sen. Don Thomas of
Dalton and first-term Sen. Phil Gingrey of Cobb _ as well as a
Democratic nurse, Nadine Thomas. (With his change of status, the
Republicans have also acquired a veterinarian in Sen. Sonny Perdue
of Bonaire, although he lists his calling as ``agri-business.'')
</P>
<P>
   The way these professional-political shifts over time can change
the way legislation is approached was evidenced by Monday's debate
over Senate Bill 16, which would give optometrists the right to
prescribe certain kinds of topical drugs as well as give samples to
patients.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest reason this session has been slow in defining itself
is that Gov. Roy Barnes' mandate to get something done about the
metro area's transportation woes has tended to blur the usual
differences.
</P>
<P>
   Republican and Democrat, developer and environmentalist,
bureaucrat and industry rep all sing from the same page, dutifully
observing, for the time being, the Pax trafficus.
</P>
<P>
   So there was a little extra interest in the optometrists' bill,
an evergreen issue over which there are at least clearly defined
lines, if not a full-fledged fight.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago the medical merits of this bill would have been
debated entirely secondhand. But on Monday, Don Thomas, an opponent
of the bill, regaled his fellow senators with med school stories of
working on cadavers until he reeked of formaldehyde and learning
how to revive guinea pigs from anaphylactic shock. His point being
that the ability to prescribe drugs should not be casually granted
to those who have not undergone such rigorous training.
</P>
<P>
   It was a vivid argument, and it carried the day, although maybe
not more than that. The bill fell a vote shy of a majority, but
will be reconsidered today.

 TRENTON, N.J.: ``legislative interference.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Jersey reinstated capital punishment in 1982, and since then
14 convicts have been sentenced to death. But because of the
appeals process and the insistence by the courts that a sentence
for a given crime be proportional to those imposed on other
inmates, the state has yet to carry out an execution, and a
succession of state leaders have tried to streamline the process.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Gov. Jim Florio signed legislation intended to restrict
``proportionality review.'' Last year, Whitman impaneled a
Commission on the Death Penalty, which also criticized the length
of the appeals process.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the death penalty expressed disappointment Monday
that the state's highest court did not overturn the capital
punishment law, but said they took comfort in the fact that the
court was eager to get more information on the question of racial
disparities.
</P>
<P>
   In her ruling, Poritz acknowledged that the small number of
death penalty cases left the statistical conclusions open to
question, and she appointed a judge to study the issue and search
for a ``sound methodology capable of producing reliable results.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Waldor, one of the few members of the Commission on the
Death Penalty to oppose capital punishment, expressed relief that
the court did not strike down the proportionality issue. ``What
they are saying here is that it be administered with some semblance
of equality,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of the death penalty also hailed the decision as
a step toward speedy justice and a more reasonable appeals process
for convicts condemned to death. Dick Zimmer, the former U.S.
representative who was chairman of Whitman's death penalty
commission, predicted that a review of the proportionality policy
would lead to its restriction, or even its abolition, because it is
too muddled for even judges to understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The justices have taken nearly two years to decide that they
can't answer basic questions about their statistical analysis and
have had to ask a special master to sort out the mess,'' Zimmer
said. ``The time has come to abolish proportionality review.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of the 39 states that now impose capital
punishment have enacted measures to limit the appeals process,
according to experts, and the average time that elapses between
sentence and execution is now nine years. Some states, like
Virginia, have streamlined the appeals process to a point where
some inmates are executed five years after being sentenced, said
Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information
Center, a nonprofit research organization based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's court ruling leaves New Jersey among a handful of
states in which the legislative and judicial wrestling over the
appeals process has prevented any executions from taking place.
</P>
<P>
   ``There haven't been any inmates whose death penalty conviction
has been overturned on the basis of race discrimination studies in
state or federal court,'' Dieter said. ``It's been a pretty blanket
lockout. But studies showing bias are still out there and still
disturbing to the courts, the legislators and the public in
general.''
</P>
<P>
   Loftin, the Death Row inmate, was convicted of shooting a gas
station clerk in Lawrenceville in 1992 and was sentenced to death
despite testimony from psychiatrists who said he suffered from a
borderline personality disorder.
</P>
<P>
   In arguing for the reversal of Loftin's conviction, the public
defender's office said his punishment was unduly harsh when
compared with those of other defendants convicted of similar
crimes. The public defender also offered a statistical analysis of
capital cases in New Jersey as evidence that blacks convicted of
capital crimes against whites were more likely than other
defendants to receive a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at what factors really influence juries in
deciding who lives and who dies, the race of a defendant is just as
important and has just as much impact as the list of factors
permitted in the statute,'' said Claudia Van Wyck, a deputy public
defender. ``There is no other rational explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   But the court said the claim of racial bias was unconvincing and
pointed to its own study, conducted by a retired Superior Court
judge, Richard Cohen, which found that blacks had been sentenced to
death in 13.79 percent of all death-eligible cases in the state
since 1982, as opposed to 13.84 percent in the case of whites.
</P>
<P>
   Associate Justice Alan Handler was the lone dissenter from the
majority opinion. Handler, who has a long history of voting to
strike down the death penalty, said the Legislature's attempt to
limit death penalty appeals was unconstitutional and that the
public defender's statistical findings raised troubling questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``An unconstitutional risk of racial discrimination in the
imposition of the death penalty has, in my opinion, been laid bare
and exposed,'' he wrote in his dissent.

U.S. BACKS OFF PAYING RUSSIANS $600 MILLION FOR SPACE EFFORT 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) The Clinton administration has backed off a proposal
to pay the financially ailing Russians up to $600 million over the
next few years to preserve their participation in the U.S.-led
international space station, NASA administrator Dan Goldin said
Monday as he previewed the agency's proposed $13.6 billion budget.
</P>
<P>
   When introduced publicly last fall as part of a three-step
strategy to deal with shortfalls in Russian spending on the
project, the proposal drew only lukewarm support from lawmakers.
Many within NASA, which is faced with its own cost overruns, were
even less pleased.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of a $60 million NASA payment to the Russians in late
1998 to ensure the launching of the new station's crucial and
long-delayed service module by the end of July, the problems
persist. Additionally, the Russians are proposing to keep their
13-year-old Mir space station in orbit for another three years in
spite of pledges to NASA that it would send the outpost plunging
into the ocean by the end of 1999 to free up funds for the new
station.
</P>
<P>
   ``After conferring with the administration and the Congress, we
have decided we are going to put zero dollars beyond 1999 at this
point in time,'' Goldin said Monday. The federal government's
fiscal 1999 budget year began last Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it would be inappropriate at this time to specify
or put that money in the budget because it `disincentives' the
Russian government to fund the Russian Space Agency,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to hold the funds could be reversed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will monitor the situation closely,'' Goldin added.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for last year's $60 million NASA payment, Russian
agreed to give the Americans research and storage space aboard
their service module, which is to provide the initial living
quarters on the new station. The United States was counting on
those funds to pay for the final components and pre-launch testing
of the service module as well as initial parts for the new Soyuz
crew transport and Progress cargo capsules pledged by the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   In January, NASA said the Russians would be unable to launch the
service module before the end of September, 17 months later than
promised. Engineering assessments next month in Moscow will
determine whether further slips are likely.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly of the station, which eventually will have European,
Japanese, Canadian and Russian contributions, began in November and
December with the launches of the Russian-built, U.S.-financed
control module and an American shuttle-launched compartment that
will link future components furnished by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin said Monday that NASA's proposed $13.6 billion budget for
the year 2000 includes adequate funding for the United States to
cut its reliance on Russian space station participation.
</P>

   In all, according to Goldin, NASA has been forced to find $1.2
billion so far to deal with Russia's station lapses. The money has
come from a slowdown in the production of research gear for the
station, a cut in the number of shuttle launches due to station
construction delays and the recent cancellation of a major effort
to develop a modern supersonic airliner.

HOUSTON POLICE TRYING TO CURB USE OF DEADLY FORCE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By S.K. BARDWELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Houston Police Chief C.O. Bradford has instituted
additional training, more deployment of specialized weapons such as
tasers and a new review process in the wake of some controversial
police shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want them to do what they have to do to survive,'' Bradford
said of the more than 5,000 officers under his command. But, he
added, officers must understand that ``for each round they
discharge, there is accountability required.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradford said he formed a Critical Incident Review Group,
composed of officers and chaired by an assistant chief, to study
some of the shootings and recommend training changes or additions
that could better the department's response to similar calls.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford recently began the process to train some patrol
officers from each patrol district in the use of tasers, hand-held
devices that deliver an electrical shock.
</P>
<P>
   For years, only Houston police sergeants received the training
on using tasers.
</P>
<P>
   The department has been criticized for not using such a device
on Sheryl Seymour, who called paramedics Jan. 20 and demanded to be
taken to a psychiatric facility, then attacked them and arriving
police with a large knife.
</P>
<P>
   Before a sergeant could arrive with a taser, Seymour, 40,
charged at police and paramedics with her knife and was shot and
killed.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the Mental Health Association of Greater Houston will
begin a pilot program in which 60 Houston officers will receive
intensive training in dealing with the mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford said a traditional police response to a psychologically
ill person with a weapon may not be the best way to handle such an
instance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to train officers differently and not put ourselves in
a position where we have to use deadly force,'' Bradford said.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston department is often criticized for shooting
suspects, impaired or not, when armed with anything other than a
gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have different experiences,'' Bradford said. ``There's
a lack of understanding ... when (police) are not confronted with
what citizens believe is a deadly weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bats, ice picks, machetes, they're all deadly weapons. We do
not expect our officers to go up against someone with a deadly
weapon. They don't get a second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradford said he is also concerned over the number of shots
fired in some incidents. The number has gone up greatly over the
past two decades as more officers began carrying semiautomatic
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Houston police were widely criticized in October after seven
officers fired 59 shots at Derek Kaeseman after a chase from
downtown Houston into suburban Fort Bend County.
</P>
<P>
   Kaeseman, 24, was shot 14 times as he climbed from his wrecked
vehicle holding a shiny object that turned out to be a can opener.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford could not comment on the Kaeseman incident specifically
because it remains under investigation by his internal affairs
division, but said, ``In some instances, I'm concerned the total
environment is not being considered _ what's around that suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   In another shooting, six Houston officers, without a search or
arrest warrant, burst into an apartment July 12 and killed Pedro
Oregon Navarro.
</P>
<P>
   The officers, who said they had a tip that drugs were being sold
in the apartment, fired about 33 shots, hitting Oregon 12 times.
The officers said Oregon pointed a gun at them, and believed he had
shot one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford fired all six officers, although only one was charged,
with misdemeanor criminal trespass. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Bradford said it also concerns him when a large number of
officers fire on a suspect, because ``I don't know if those
officers are firing in fear for their lives, or because another
officer shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to make sure that when each officer fires, it is
because he perceives an imminent threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the number of police shootings in the city is well
below that of five years ago, records show.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Houston officers fired their weapons in 70 incidents,
the same number as in 1993, but killed or wounded significantly
fewer civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Police shot 19 people, nine fatally, last year, and five
officers were wounded. In 1993, police shot 29 people, killing 14,
and two officers were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Narcotics operations accounted for several of 1998's shootings,
which included two citizen fatalities and two wounded officers. But
narcotics-related shootings were down in relation to the amount of
drugs seized and narcotics arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic violence calls accounted for two fatal police shootings
last year and an officer being badly cut. Nearly 50 of the 254
slayings in Houston in 1998 involved domestic violence.

MONICA LEWINSKY AGAIN TESTIFIES UNDER OATH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica Lewinsky testified under oath Monday as
House prosecutors and White House lawyers began a series of
close-door depositions in the Senate impeachment trial of President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's interrogation, her 23rd session with officials
investigating her affair with the president, ended with Clinton's
lawyers passing on a chance to question Lewinsky, instead
apologizing to her ``on behalf of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   The session, which was videotaped for senators to view privately
beginning early today, reportedly turned up nothing at odds with
Lewinsky's earlier testimony or, in the opinion of one of the
participants, helpful to the Republican drive to terminate
Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton lawyer David Kendall said he was asking a
federal judge to sanction independent counsel Kenneth Starr over a
published report that the special prosecutor was considering
whether to indict Clinton on criminal charges before he leaves
office.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, whose office already is under investigation for illegally
leaking grand jury information, denied that he was the source for
the weekend report and launched an internal investigation to
determine the source of the New York Times story.
</P>
<P>
   ``This office has no desire to inject itself into the
constitutional process under way in the Senate,'' said Starr, whose
report to Congress in early September prompted the House, in a
party-line vote, to impeach Clinton and send his case to the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, only the second president tried by the Senate, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice, allegations that
grew out of his effort to conceal his adulterous relationship with
Lewinsky. The impeachment trial, which formally opened on Jan. 7,
could end with Clinton's removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   In calling Lewinsky, senators are seeking any new information
she might provide regarding her decision to lie in an affidavit in
the Paula Jones lawsuit. They also want information on the
president's effort to find her a job and whether that campaign
intensified when her name appeared on the witness list in the Jones
case. Also in question is the president's role, if any, in her
decision to hide gifts received from him.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Washington power broker Vernon Jordan, a close friend and
confidant of the president's, is to be questioned in a room at the
Capitol used mostly to discuss secret national security issues. On
Wednesday, White House aide Sidney Blumenthal is to testify, also
in secret.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors want to quiz Jordan about his drive, initiated
by presidential secretary Betty Currie and endorsed by Clinton, to
find Lewinsky a job in New York. Prosecutors also want him to
explain inconsistencies between his testimony before Starr's grand
jury and the version Lewinsky provided during 22 sessions with
grand jurors and Starr's investigators
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, prosecutors plan to question Blumenthal about
conversations he had with the president in which Clinton denied
engaging in sex with Lewinsky, claimed that she ``threatened'' him
and described her as a stalker.
</P>
<P>
   In her five-hour deposition Monday in the presidential suite of
Washington's Mayflower Hotel, Lewinsky responded to questions from
Rep. Ed Bryant, a Tennessee Republican and House prosecutor
assigned to interview the former White House intern as four
senators and members of Clinton's legal team listened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pleased with today's events and felt it was a productive
session,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   When he was finished, the president's lawyers -- private
attorney Nicole Seligman and Deputy White House Counsel Cheryl
Mills -- passed on the chance to pose their own questions. Seligman
read a statement apologizing to Lewinsky ``on behalf of the
president for all the trouble the investigation and impeachment
trial had caused her,'' according to published reports.
</P>
<P>
   Absent some startling revelations from the three depositions, or
from live testimony if the Senate demands the witnesses' appearance
during the trial, senators have agreed to vote by Feb. 12 on the
two articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Votes on procedural matters have shown all but one of the 45
Senate Democrats opposing the Republican-led effort to oust
Clinton. If they remain unified when the final impeachment votes
are held, Democrats could block his conviction and removal, which
would take a two-thirds vote.
</P>
<P>
   Early Monday, Kendall said he was asking U.S. District Judge
Norma Holloway Johnson to require Starr to show why he ``and
members of his staff should not be held in contempt for improper
violations of grand jury secrecy.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Kendall's complaint is a New York Times story
quoting unidentified Starr ``associates'' saying that the
independent counsel, which has investigated Clinton's private
business dealings, misuse of FBI files, missing billing records and
the suicide of deputy White House counsel Vincent Foster, has
determined that he has the authority to indict Clinton before he
leaves office in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, Clinton's legal team has accused Starr's
office several times of leaking sensitive information embarrassing
to the president. Johnson ordered an investigation of earlier
allegations of Starr leaks, but that inquiry has not been
completed.
</P>
<P>
   Federal rules prohibit prosecutors from disclosing information
about grand jury proceedings. Johnson, who oversees the Starr
probe, has said the rules prohibit disclosing the strategy or
direction of an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bakaly III, a spokesman for Starr, said the independent
counsel had ``not made a formal decision or final decision'' on
whether he has the constitutional authority to indict a sitting
president.

PRESIDENT CLINTON UNVEILS $1.77 TRILLION BUDGET 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
WASHINGTON _ Urging America to grasp a rare opportunity, President
Clinton officially unveiled Monday a $1.77 trillion budget to open
the 21st century with plans to save Social Security, bolster the
Pentagon and social programs and pay down the national debt.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The five-volume budget packet, symbolically printed in black
instead of the varying colors of past years for its record $117
billion surplus of black ink, would create a series of tax credits
for working families with children, families who care for a parent
and families who want to create a retirement fund.
</P>
<P>
   However, it avoids any across-the-board tax cut that Republicans
have made a centerpiece of their legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget sets the stage for a showdown between the White
House and Congress over how to spend the surpluses projected for
decades to come, providing a new political drama to replace past
battles over red ink.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a rare opportunity that comes along once in a blue
moon to any group of Americans,'' Clinton said. ``But with our
economy expanding and our surplus rising, we have confidence that
we can now look to the long-term challenges of our country, to
fulfill our obligations to 21st century Americans, both young and
old.''
</P>
<P>
   The fiscal year 2000 budget, which begins Oct. 1, lays out in
cold numbers the warm poll-tested rhetoric that Clinton offered in
his State of the Union.
</P>
<P>
   It calls for setting aside 62 percent, or $2.8 trillion, of the
projected $4 trillion budget over 15 years to save Social Security.
It also calls for using 15 percent to save Medicare from
bankruptcy, 12 percent to fund retirement savings accounts (or USA
Accounts) for working families, and 11 percent to provide more
money for defense and education programs.
</P>
<P>
   Setting aside the surplus for Social Security and Medicare,
whose trust funds are invested in government bonds, also would help
trim the nearly $4 trillion national debt, reducing it to its
lowest percentage levels since 1917.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget also proposes raising taxes by $82 billion over
five years, including $53.4 billion from a 55-cent-per-pack tax
increase on cigarettes and closing corporate tax shelters.
</P>
<P>
   It also would allocate billions of dollars more on education to
pay for 100,000 new teachers, new school funds to help improve
student achievement, more police officers, pay raises for military
personnel and to bolster defense spending again after years of
decline.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton, whose impeachment trial may draw to a close this
month without his removal, called for bipartisanship as the
administration and Congress confront the long-term challenges
facing the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, several Republican leaders embraced Clinton's idea
to set aside the surplus for Social Security. But they wasted
little time in blasting Clinton's budget plan for taxing and
spending too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big government has been reborn and reinvented with this
budget,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., Senate Budget Committee
chairman. ``It's clear that the president has initiated scores of
new programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, said, ``In all my years in Congress, I've never seen
such a kitchen-sink approach to government. The budget contains
something for everyone and that's what's troubling. It's a
throwback to the days when the government tried to solve problems
by raising taxes and throwing money at problems.''
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, complained, ``Out of
$4 trillion in projected budget surpluses over the next 15 years,
the president can't find one penny for tax cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials pointed to several tax credit
proposals targeted to lower- and middle-income families.
</P>
<P>
   The USA Account would create a 401(k) savings plan for
low-income Americans by creating a tax incentive that would provide
a matching contribution by the government to the taxpayers'
savings. It would cost $536 billion over 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The budget would create a $1,000 tax credit to elderly Americans
or to their families that provide long-term care, a $1,000 tax
credit to cover special transportation costs and technology needs
of disabled workers and expand by $345 a child-care tax credit for
families earning up to $59,000.
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats, the East Room ceremony unveiling the budget
provided a measure of vindication. In 1993, Democrats, then
controlling Congress, passed a $500 billion package that raised
taxes and cut spending, without any support from Republicans. The
next year, many of them were defeated and Republicans assumed
control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what the president did today was demonstrate how long
it takes for this country to pull itself out of a hole when we have
made a major public policy mistake, one rooted in irresponsibility,
as we did in 1981,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., senior Democrat
on the House Appropriations Committee. Obey referred to the budget
passed by Congress and the Reagan administration that began the
country down the road of massive deficit spending and quadrupling
of the national debt within eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This budget is not perfect, but it is certainly a vindication
of every action that has been taken in the last six years to try to
put us back in the world of black ink,'' Obey said.

VICTIM'S MOTHER ISN'T FORGIVING ACCUSED IN JASPER CASE &HT;     

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD STEWART 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ Viewing a new black granite tombstone on her
son's grave, the mother of James Byrd Jr. said Monday that she
hasn't forgiven the men accused of dragging the black man to death
behind a pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want justice done,'' said Stella Byrd, who added that
none of the three white men charged with the June 7 murder of her
son have expressed regret for his slaying.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that defendant John William ``Bill'' King, 24, got to
hug his 6-month-old son for the first time last week during a break
in jury selection for his capital murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way I get to hug my son is to come out here and visit
his grave,'' she said. ``The last time I got to hug him was the
night before he was killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Stella Byrd said James Byrd's granddaughter can never hug her
grandfather again. ``She points at his picture and asks where he
is,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued by the family Monday said ``each individual
Byrd family member is going through this process at his or her own
pace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some have forgiven in the sense that they are now able to go
beyond the horrible day of June 7, and are trying to regain some
normalcy in their lives, as they wait until justice is finally
served on the men responsible for James Jr.'s death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not believe in destructive hate, but we are righteously
angry about the senseless murder of James.''
</P>
<P>
   James Byrd Sr. attended the opening day of jury selection last
week, but became so upset that he later had to undergo medical
tests in Beaumont.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's sister, Clara Taylor, said the family hopes for justice
through the court system.
</P>
<P>
   The new tombstone was bought by the New York-based National
Ethnic Coalition of Organizations to replace a nameplate that was
stolen from the grave's vault cover last November. A spokesman for
the coalition said that if vandals do anything to the new marker,
the organization will replace it and provide guards to make sure it
isn't defaced again.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Verrett, another of Byrd's sisters, said the family had
first sought solace in the thought that Byrd was unconscious when
he was chained behind a pickup truck and dragged almost three miles
along back country roads. But when King's trial opened last week,
prosecutors said evidence would show that the victim was conscious
and tried to lift himself from the pavement when the dragging
began.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was hard to hear,'' Verrett said.
</P>
<P>
   Verrett and Taylor were in the courtroom Monday, as was King's
father, Ronald King, as lawyers questioned possible jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers approved five more jurors, bringing to 27 the number who
have qualified for the trial. Five are black.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys hope to qualify about 50 for a pool that will be used
to pick 12 jurors and two alternates. Testimony is expected to
begin Feb. 16.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, King will face life in prison or death by
injection.
</P>
<P>
   Trials for his co-defendants, Shawn Allen Berry, 23, and
Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31, have not been set.

JUDGE TO BAN TEXAS SALES OF SELF-HELP LEGAL SOFTWARE &HT;     

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In a precedent-setting opinion, a federal judge
in Dallas says he plans to ban the sale of self-help legal software
in Texas as the unauthorized practice of law.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Barefoot Sanders released a summary judgment
Jan. 22 to prevent Parsons Technology Inc. from distributing future
copies of Quicken Family Lawyer and Quicken Family Lawyer '99 in
Texas. Products already in stores apparently are unaffected by the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   An injunction to enforce the ruling could be issued within the
next two weeks, lawyers involved in the case said. Attorneys for
Parsons said they are planning to challenge the ruling and will ask
the judge to place the ban on hold, pending a decision from the 5th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The new legal muzzle on the popular self-help products drew
rebukes from consumer groups and industry experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can quote me: This is sick. This reeks of greed,'' said
Ann Stephens, president of PC Data, a company that tracks the sale
of software for personal computers. ``Boy, these lawyers are
sticking up for their own, aren't they? I don't think they're
representing you or me.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the eight states that have considered cases against self-help
legal publishers, Texas is the first to opt for a ban, said David
Schenck, an appellate lawyer representing Parsons Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas is apparently alone in banning books and software
according to the judge's ruling,'' Schenck said. ``Our opinion is
the Texas statute doesn't reach that far and if it did it would
violate the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   The do-it-yourself products sell for under $30, and the latest
version offers more than 100 legal forms and instructions on how to
file your own will, prenuptial agreement, employment contract, real
estate lease and similar documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it means, really to be honest, not that much to the
company, but what it does to the common people is sad,'' Stephens
said of the court decision.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's ruling marked a major victory for the Unauthorized
Practice of Law Committee, an arm of the Texas Supreme Court that
is fully funded by the State Bar of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups and lawyers representing self-help publishers
complain that the operations of the committee's investigative arm
are cloaked in secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Ticer, a Dallas attorney who chairs the investigative
subcommittee, praised Sanders' decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think overall it is probably the most comprehensive,
well-reasoned, authoritative judicial opinion in the United States
on this subject,'' Ticer said. ``It becomes a benchmark or a
measuring stick as to what constitutes unauthorized practice of law
for some self-help materials.''
</P>
<P>
   Ticer said the committee argued that the Quicken Family Lawyer
products go beyond generic information because they are
interactive. Users wishing to draft their own wills, for instance,
would answer questions about whether they are married or single,
how many children they have, and so on. The program would then
chose a form that fits the individual's characteristics and provide
instructions for filling it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, what you had was a cyber-lawyer. They were doing
the drafting, everything for you,'' Ticer said.
</P>
<P>
   Ticer said some of these Quicken-produced documents might be
unenforceable in Texas if an individual needed to take certain
actions before filing the document. He acknowledged, however, that
no one has shown evidence of such harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't wait around till the damage is done, if somebody
raises a red flag. Then the person complaining would say, `Why
didn't you do something about this? You knew it was wrong to begin
with,''' Ticer said.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the source of the complaint leading to the
federal court action was an average consumer, a judge or a lawyer,
and Ticer said he's not at liberty to reveal that information, even
generically.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot reveal the sources of complaints. If I do that I'm
in big trouble,'' Ticer said. ``In this case it's totally
irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Walt Borges, who follows legal issues for the consumer advocacy
group Texas Watch, does not share that opinion and sharply
criticized the committee's secretive investigative practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just an absurd situation. Basically we've got a bunch of
lawyers on this thing who are secretive. How can a bunch of lawyers
run a kangaroo court like this and not give us any of the rights
they would demand if they were being dragged in?'' Borges said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ought to be called the Authorized Monopoly of Law Committee
as opposed to the Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee,'' he
said. The ruling is especially troubling, he added,because 60
percent of Texans who responded to a recent poll said that they
were unable to afford lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Nolo Press, another legal publisher under investigation by the
committee, is awaiting a Texas Supreme Court decision in a freedom
of information lawsuit it filed challenging the committee's
secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a government agency out there that is taking the
position that a number of its investigative meetings are secret,''
said Peter Kennedy, a Nolo Press lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's now obvious that the committee has significant power to
be a censor over legal publications, file lawsuits to ban books.
It's not hyperbole, either.''
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, about $500,000 worth of the Quicken Family Lawyer
software was sold last year, resulting in profits of $100,000,
according to Schenck, Parsons Technology's lawyer.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to bolster an obstruction-of-justice charge
against President Clinton, a House Republican prosecutor
interviewed Monica Lewinsky under oath and on videotape for nearly
four hours on Monday. White House lawyers offered only an apology
to the young woman and made no inquiries of their own, several
officials familiar with the session said.
</P>
<P>
   The questioning of Ms. Lewinsky in the 10th floor Presidential
Suite of the Mayflower Hotel marked a new and possibly final phase
in the Senate's impeachment trial, which stemmed from Clinton's
efforts to cover up his sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, a
former White House intern. At various points in the day, six
senators sat in.
</P>
<P>
   One year after the scandal seized Washington, Ms. Lewinsky, 25,
once again received a statement of regret for the disruption to her
life and apologies to her family. Several officials familiar with
the session said that the lawyers representing the president asked
her no questions. Instead, one of them, Nicole K. Seligman, read
her an apology on behalf of the president for her ordeal across a
year of investigations. The president first apologized to Ms.
Lewinsky shortly after he publicly admitted to the relationship
last August.
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings began at 9:03 a.m. and ended at 3:14, with
several breaks, including an hour for lunch. The actual questioning
took far less time than the eight hours that had been allotted by
the Senate. Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., who conducted the interview
for the House prosecutors, said in a written statement, ``I was
pleased with today's events and felt it was a productive session.''
</P>
<P>
   But the White House's decision not to use its four hours for
questioning suggested that the lawyers felt no startling new
information had emerged. The House focused on her affidavit in the
Paula Jones lawsuit, denying a sexual relationship with Clinton; on
the help Vernon Jordan gave her in seeking a job, and on the
retrieval of gifts from the president by Clinton's secretary, Betty
Currie.
</P>
<P>
   Plato Cacheris, Ms. Lewinsky's lawyer, said Monday night, ``She
was excused as a witness, and that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   As the senators emerged from the hotel, they emphasized their
chamber's efforts to keep the deposition process secret. ``We are
under a prohibition from the United States Senate not to talk any
further about this,'' Sen. Mike DeWine, R &UR; - &LR; Ohio, said. DeWine
presided over the proceedings for the Republicans; Democrats began
the day with Sen. Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont presiding but took
turns at the job as the session wore on.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant canceled appearances he had scheduled for Monday night on
the CNN programs ``Larry King Live'' and ``Crossfire.'' ``We set
them up because it seemed like he could possibly talk about the
deposition afterwards,'' said Steve Susens, his spokesman.
``Somewhere down the line he decided against it.''
</P>
<P>
   It had been considered unlikely that Ms. Lewinsky would break
substantial new ground because under her immunity agreement with
the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, she could be prosecuted for
changing her story.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the White House went into the session with some
assurances that explosive new information was unlikely to emerge
and it could take the magnanimous route of simply making an
apology.
</P>
<P>
   Senators will be allowed to view the videotape of the
questioning on Tuesday, even as the House and White House lawyers
question a second witness, Jordan, about his efforts to help Ms.
Lewinsky find a job. A less sensational presence than Ms. Lewinsky,
Jordan, a Washington lawyer close to Clinton, is to be questioned
on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate was arranging for three group showings of Ms.
Lewinsky's videotaped deposition in three large rooms in the
Capitol, and individual senators can see the tape in a separate
recording room. Senators will also be able to read her deposition.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday a third witness, Sidney Blumenthal, a senior White
House aide, is to be questioned about the president's remarks to
him that he had been stalked by Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the Senate trial is to resume. Senators will then
vote on whether to allow the videotaped depositions to be shown as
part of the trial and on whether to call the witnesses themselves
for questioning before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Although House prosecutors once wanted to call as many as 15
witnesses, they narrowed their list to three under pressure from
Senate Republicans, who were eager to bring the case to a close.
The House prosecutors want to use Ms. Lewinsky, Jordan and
Blumenthal to bolster one article of impeachment in particular;
that article charges Clinton with obstructing justice in his
efforts to hide the affair. A number of senators have said they
take this charge more seriously than a second one, which charges
Clinton with perjury.
</P>
<P>
   A battery of lawyers, lawmakers and aides attended the
questioning of Ms. Lewinsky on Monday. Besides DeWine, other
senators were also deputized to monitor the proceedings: for the
Republicans, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and Fred Thompson of
Tennessee; for the Democrats, Leahy, Christopher J. Dodd of
Connecticut and John Edwards of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   As a witness subpoenaed by the Senate, Ms. Lewinsky had her
coach air fare from California and her hotel expenses paid for by
the Senate. With scores of photographers and camera crews staking
out the sidewalks, the hotel made the Presidential Suite available
free for the questioning.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Officials familiar with the session, who spoke on condition that
they not be identified, described Ms. Lewinsky as poised, even
occasionally humorous, throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said Bryant, a former prosecutor, covered several
areas that have been of interest to the team of House managers.
They said that he asked Ms. Lewinsky to run through the events
leading to her delivery of some of the president's gifts to Mrs.
Currie and that Ms. Lewinsky stuck to her prior testimony that it
was Mrs. Currie who had initiated the collection of the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, the officials said, also quizzed her about the time Mrs.
Currie picked up the gifts and about a cell phone call by Mrs.
Currie to Ms. Lewinsky's apartment that the White House has argued
undercuts Ms. Lewinsky because it came an hour and a half after Ms.
Lewinsky said Mrs. Currie had picked up the gifts. Ms. Lewinsky,
officials said, said her memory had become more hazy over time.
</P>
<P>
   At other moments in the questioning, Ms. Lewinsky pointed the
House prosecutor back to her statements before the grand jury,
officials said. She did so, they said, when Bryant asked whether
Jordan had ever said he was acting on behalf of the president as he
was helping her seek a job in New York. Ms. Lewinsky had told the
grand jury that Jordan never made such a claim.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant asked her why she had filed a false affidavit in the
sexual harassment suit brought by Ms. Jones against Clinton. One
person familiar with the testimony said Ms. Lewinsky repeated her
statement that the president never instructed her to lie.
</P>
<P>
   With the Senate worried about a spectacle in the chamber, Bryant
last week assured senators that he would stay away from the sexual
detail of Ms. Lewinsky's relationship with the president and ask
her to ``simply affirm those provisions'' of her prior testimony in
this realm.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that on Monday when Bryant started to ask a
question getting into sexual detail, Cacheris, her lawyer,
objected. DeWine and Leahy quickly held the question to be out of
line.
</P>
<P>
   Before the questioning began Monday morning, the White House
also went on the offensive against Starr because of a story in The
New York Times on Sunday. Citing associates of Starr, the article
said the independent counsel had decided he had the constitutional
authority to seek an indictment of Clinton while he is in office.
It said he had not decided if he would do so.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, Clinton's private attorney, said he was asking a
federal court to require the independent counsel to show why he and
his staff ``should not be held in contempt for improper violations
of grand jury secrecy.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr said in a statement that he was ``deeply troubled'' by the
story and that his office ``has no desire to inject itself into the
constitutional process under way in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was ``launching an internal investigation to
determine whether anyone in this office improperly disclosed the
information.''

SETBACK FOR LAW SHIELDING MINORS FROM SMUT WEB SITES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Ore.) (lb) 
 By PAMELA MENDELS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction on Monday to
block a new law that supporters said would shield children from
pornography on the World Wide Web but that opponents said would
chill free speech online.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision, Judge Lowell Reed Jr. of District Court in
Philadelphia wrote that many of those who had brought the lawsuit
to stop the law, the Child Online Protection Act, had said their
fears of prosecution under the law would result in self-censorship,
and that he had concluded ``such fears are reasonable given the
breadth of the statute.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a chilling effect,'' he continued, ``could result in the
censoring of constitutionally protected speech, which constitutes
an irreparable harm to the plaintiffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed cited the ``personal regret'' that his decision would
``delay once again the careful protection of our children.'' But,
he added, ``perhaps we do the minors of this country harm if the
First Amendment protections, which they will with age inherit
fully, are chipped away in the name of their protection.''
</P>
<P>
   The law, which was signed by President Clinton last October, has
never gone into effect, because Reed blocked it last fall under a
temporary restraining order that was to expire at midnight Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Beeson, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union,
which led a coalition of businesses and groups opposed to the law,
said she was ``thrilled'' by the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet again, a federal judge has recognized that Congress must
be careful _ and it has not been careful _ when it passes laws that
burden speech on the Internet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Department of Justice, which defended the
law, had no comment beyond saying that government lawyers were
reviewing the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Taylor, a lawyer for the National Law Center for Children
and Families, which filed court papers on behalf of legislators who
sponsored the law, said he was disappointed by the ruling. The
legislators ``intended COPA to regulate porn sites to stop giving
their teasers to our kids,'' Taylor said, referring to free samples
that some pornographic Web sites offered visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs, meanwhile, were jubilant. ``We can operate business
as usual,'' said Mitchell Tepper, who operates the Sexual Health
Network, a small Web site with information on sex for the disabled.
Tepper had testified in court that he feared the candid nature of
his site could put it in jeopardy if the new law stayed on the
books.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The law would make it illegal for the operator of a commercial
Web site to make sexually explicit material deemed harmful to
minors available to those under 17. A site that carried such
material, but that gated it off from children through credit cards
or other mechanisms to verify the age of the user, would have an
acceptable defense under the act. Violators face fines of up to
$50,000 per offense and six months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was introduced in Congress last year after an
earlier effort to regulate children's access to pornography online,
the Communications Decency Act, was found to be unconstitutionally
broad in a 1997 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   That law was wider in scope than the Child Online Protection
Act. It banned not only material harmful to minors, which, among
other things, must lack scientific, literary, artistic or political
value for those under 17, but ``indecent'' material in general.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the new law say it is aimed primarily at teaser ads,
free samples offered by Web pornography sites that sell most of
their material. But opponents say the law is so broad that it could
be applied to other kinds of Web ventures that frequently or on
occasion carry sexually explicit content, like those dealing with
gynecological issues.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs included a broad variety of Web businesses, from
Condomania, a condom retailer, to Powell's Bookstore, the online
version of a general-interest bookstore chain in Portland, Ore.

MILLS GODWIN JR., 84; RULED VIRGINIA AS DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Gov. Mills Edwin Godwin Jr. of Virginia, who rose above
his segregationist past to become one of his state's most effective
chief executives, died Jan. 30 in Newport News, Va. He was 84 and
lived in Suffolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Godwin had just been released from Riverside Hospital in Newport
News, where he was treated for pneumonia, said the office of Gov.
James S. Gilmore III in Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   Godwin was the only two-term governor for the Commonwealth of
Virginia since the Civil War, and he served his terms eight years
apart _ elected in 1965 as a Democrat and in 1973 as a Republican.
He epitomized the end of an era dominated by the Democratic machine
of Harry F. Byrd Sr., whose organization ran Virginia politics from
the 1920s to the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   In his first term, Godwin broke with the policies of the Byrd
machine and was able to piece together a mainline conservative
coalition that attracted labor leaders and the rank and file,
African-Americans and whites, liberals as well as conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   With such broad support he was able to build roads, overhaul the
state Constitution and tap a new source of revenue in the form of
sales taxes. His legacy was a community college system that gave
Virginia an educational basis for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Born a farm boy in Chuckatuck, Va., Mills Godwin was a 1938 law
graduate of the University of Virginia and practiced law in his
home county, Nansemond, until 1960. He was elected to the Virginia
House of Delegates in 1947 and to the state Senate in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the Senate that he became a pillar of his state's
policy of ``massive resistance'' to the racial integration of
schools. He vowed that there would be no compromise on the issue.
But that intransigence shattered in the late 1950s, and he
eventually argued that Virginia just needed time to adjust to the
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected lieutenant governor in 1961 and governor four
years later. He later left the splintering Democratic Party and was
elected to a second four-year term as a Republican in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   After his second term, he worked as a business consultant and
corporate director.
</P>
<P>
   Godwin is survived by his wife of 58 years, Katherine Beale
Godwin, and a sister, Leah G. Keith of Chesapeake, Va.

 Why Las Vegas' Purchase Pro May Be One Firm Worth Watching  &HT;       
 By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
If Web stocks are turning the stock market into one big casino,
it's only fitting that Las Vegas is spawning an Internet company
poised to go public.
</P>
<P>
   Those high-octane Net stocks, which conservative fund managers
liken to playing roulette, tend to be consumer-driven and fueled by
their brand names.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate financial potential of the Internet is supposed
to be manifested in whatever benefit it brings to business. In
fact, Wall Street visionaries have proclaimed that 1999 could be
the year that investors finally pay attention to the potential of
business-to-business applications on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, Purchase Pro may be one company worth watching. The
2-year-old Las Vegas startup was custom built to help hotels,
resorts and casinos perform most of their purchasing via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Mirage Resort Chairman Steve Winn was an early stage
investor (word is that he no longer holds any stake), and Mirage
Resorts is one of Purchase Pro's biggest customers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Because the hospitality industry is under intense pressure to
lower its costs, Purchase Pro was formed to develop networks that
allow resort and hotel chains to privately negotiate their supplier
contracts, such as those for linens, over the Internet, notes
Purchase Pro President Chris Carton.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Mirage Resorts seeks bids for nearly all of the
stuff in its warehouse every six months. And ``in the past, it had
taken three people, three and a half weeks (to accomplish the
task). With Purchase Pro, it took two people just two days,'' says
Dennis Macready, director of purchasing at Mirage.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to large corporatewide purchasing deals, Purchase
Pro also provides a function where individual restaurants or hotels
can ask hundreds of suppliers to bid for spot contracts, such as
orders of produce, Carton says.
</P>
<P>
   The general idea is to cut time and save money. Clients such as
Mirage, MGM Grand and Caesar's Palace have seen the prices they pay
for goods and services slashed anywhere from 15 percent to 20
percent, Carton says.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, that model can be applied to industries other than
the hotel and resort business, such as construction and
manufacturing. Of course, the company is still privately held, but
it is already conducting its ``bake-off'' to determine which
underwriters might take them public, Carton says. ``We're very
close to making a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of STREET02 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Purchase Pro, which employs 100 people, has raised about $8
million and has almost completed its second round of financing.
Flynn-Gallagher, a Las Vegas venture capital firm, is one of its
key stakeholders.
</P>
<P>
   The company isn't out of the red yet, but it ``has a burn-rate
that is very palatable when you compare it to other Internet
startups,'' Carton says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
AMAZON CONSTRUCTION INC.: Amazon.com expounded a tad yesterday on
the company's ambition to build an internal real estate department.
The online bookseller's chief financial officer, Joy Covey, told
fund managers and other buy-siders that the company's plans to open
new shipping warehouses will hit the expense line during the first
quarter, according to attendees at the NationsBanc Montgomery
technology stock conference being held this week at the Ritz
Carlton on Nob Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Covey said that at least one more, or maybe two,
distribution-related announcements will come this year, attendees
and wire services reported.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as reported in Street Smarts, Amazon revealed in a
quarterly earnings filing that it wanted to grow distribution
capability in order to keep pace with swelling customer demand.
What was more interesting, however, was that the filing alluded to
``data centers'' and ``office'' developments. In addition, Amazon's
own Web site indicated that it was adding three new key positions
to its fledgling real estate department.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who favor electronic commerce stocks generally like
the notion that the companies have little exposure to traditional
operating risks, such as real estate leases or development costs.
Amazon's shares closed down about a buck yesterday at $115.88,
which was down about 10 bucks from $125.63 on Wednesday _ last
week's peak.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Amazon raised nearly $1.25 billion last week in a
monster convertible stock offering, which will more than adequately
fortify the Internet company's acquisition war chest.
</P>

SAN FRANCISCO RAIDERS: Thomas Weisel Partners has been beefing up
its institutional sales force at the expense of some of its rivals.
Chief executive and founder Weisel says he has hired three of
BancBoston Robertson Stephens's top salespeople: Bill Hazen, Greg
Cote and Paul Slivon.
</P>
<P>
   And while that might put a dent into the roster at Beantown
Robbie, that doesn't mean that other regional investment banks are
raid-proof. Weisel has also hired away sales executive Chris Henkel
from BT Alex. Brown and international sales specialist Otto Tschudi
from his former firm NationsBanc Montgomery Securities. Given
Weisel's passion for competitive skiing, it should be noted that
Tschudi once strapped on boards in the Winter Olympics.

   NEW YORK _ Skirt lengths have been moving up and down faster
than the stock market. But except for the ankle-brushing lengths
favored by trendy fashion folk, hems seem to have settled for now
just at the bottom of the knee. Straight or in a slight A-line,
these skirts look best with bare-looking legs and medium or high
heels.
</P>
<P>
   In the Barneys New York Collection, you'll find a slim skirt in
yellow, light blue, tan or black, all with rows of contrasting
stitching at the hem ($135); an A-line skirt in beige, khaki or
black ($125); a wrap in blue or pink silk ($295); and a
cream-colored skirt in a wool-and-silk blend with an inverted front
pleat ($395). The store also has a button-front hip-hugger in gray
by Wang ($185) and a back-wrap cream-colored organza by Wayne
Cooper ($185).
</P>
<P>
   Henri Bendel has an apron skirt in pale yellow by P.A.K. ($158)
and African prints in pink, orange, green or blue by Dona Jean
($178).

NEW MEXICO ANXIOUSY AWAITS BERUMEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. _ Terry Berumen wondered if there was some
sort of setup.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the University of New Mexico, which was recruiting her son
Rafael to play basketball, had put these people up to this.
</P>
<P>
   All these well-wishers and autograph seekers greeted Berumen
throughout his visit to Albuquerque. In fact, the moment the
6-foot-9 center from Simi Valley High stepped off the plane, a
television crew began shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought for sure the university was behind it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Which causes Ron Garcia, the New Mexico assistant who hosted the
Berumen family during their stay last September, to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia grew up in New Mexico and he knows well the intensity
fans have for their Lobos. He also knows that the Latino community
in Albuquerque is eager to embrace a player of Latino heritage.
</P>
<P>
   When Garcia took the Berumens, who are Mexican-Americans, to the
heavily Latino-populated Old Town for lunch, fans engulfed Rafael.
Storekeepers and shoppers shook Rafael's hand and told him they
hoped he'd play for the Lobos.
</P>
<P>
   This was no setup. This was New Mexico showing Berumen how much
it cared.
</P>
<P>
   The reception touched Berumen, and he immediately decided to
spurn offers from Florida State, Washington State, Oregon State and
Duquesne.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew right away that New Mexico was the place for me,''
Berumen said. ``Those people are crazy about basketball and there
aren't many places like the Pit. I can't wait to play there.''
</P>
<P>
   And New Mexico can't wait to have him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an outstanding player and he's a Latino that is
bilingual,'' Garcia said. ``I don't want to put any pressure on
him, but with all of that going for him, there is no doubt that
Rafael can be a big hit out here.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; He doesn't play above the rim, or excite anyone with athletic
ability. Rafael Berumen is a thinking man's player. He finds a way
to get it done, beating people with passing and clever moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a knack,'' said his father, Rafael Sr. ``And it's been
that way since he was a little kid. He's always been able to
score.''
</P>
<P>
   Berumen is doing plenty of scoring, among other things, this
year for Simi Valley. He's averaging 23.5 points and 11.3 rebounds
but also shows considerable poise and court vision.
</P>
<P>
   His favorite part of the game is passing, and with the Pioneers,
his unselfishness is appreciated since Simi Valley is loaded with
scorers. And Berumen, who grew up idolizing Magic Johnson, doesn't
mind feeding them the ball.
</P>
<P>
   At New Mexico, where Berumen will play small forward, Garcia
expects he'll make an immediate impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's smart enough to make up for any lack of quickness or some
of what others may deem as athletic ability,'' Garcia said. ``He's
a hard worker who knows the game. Utah and Duke make a living off
those kind of players.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Pomona, Calif., where Rafael Berumen grew up, seems like a
lifetime away from his home in middle-class Simi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, even though Berumen was always the biggest kid in
the neighborhood, he was also the most protected. As a youngster,
his parents never let him spend the night at a friend's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he noticed what we were doing because all his
friends were always at our house hanging out or spending the
night,'' Terry Berumen said. ``He was having fun, regardless. But
we were definitely concerned about the neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   The anxiety over his safety extended to Berumen's growing love
of sports. Originally, he wanted to be a football player, even
starring at quarterback on his youth teams. But the tall,
strong-armed Berumen quickly became the target for some overzealous
parents. From across the field, Rafael Sr. and Terry could hear
them screaming to take shots at the big kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like all they wanted to do was hurt Rafael,'' his
father said. ``And we weren't going to let that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to pull Berumen off the football field was made
easier by his increasing success in basketball, a popular sport in
the Berumen home. Rafael Sr., who left Mexico 20 years ago, played
basketball as a youngster. Older brother Philip played at Damien
High before becoming Rafael's personal coach.
</P>
<P>
   But clearly, Rafael was beginning to take basketball a step
beyond. He was becoming a force on youth teams, playing throughout
California in travel leagues and all-star tournaments. By the time
he enrolled at Pomona High as a freshman, Berumen was being
recognized as an emerging big man on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   He played at Pomona that year as a ninth-grader, but a dispute
over the school's academics and the family's increasing uneasiness
concerning the threatening surroundings prompted the Berumens to
look for a new, safer home.
</P>
<P>
   After first considering Sylmar and San Fernando, they settled on
Simi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Berumen's arrival in Ventura County caused an immediate stir, as
did Branduinn Fullove's transfer that same year. The Pioneers have
been accused in the past of recruiting basketball players, so when
two standouts arrived from out of the area, eyebrows raised.
</P>
<P>
   Simi Valley coach Dean Bradshaw is quick to point out that
thorough investigations have proven no wrongdoing, and insists
there is nothing he can do if talented basketball players wish to
play at Simi Valley based on past success. In other words, some
schools are magnets.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Part of the reason Latinos haven't been well represented in
basketball is cultural. Many Hispanics grow up playing soccer and
baseball, two sports with many role models. That hasn't been the
case in basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, who coached high school basketball in New Mexico for
many years, believes Latinos' generally smaller stature also is a
factor but thinks exposure plays out more prominently. He's coached
enough 6-foot-8, 6-foot-9 Latinos over the years to know that size
isn't the biggest problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys went on to play at Division II or Division III
colleges, but maybe they would have been recruited more heavily had
they played in a bigger city.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, things are changing. Players like Berumen, and Eduardo
Najera and Victor Avila, two Hispanics now at the University of
Oklahoma, show that Latinos can be successful on the college level.
</P>
<P>
   ``One is going to lead another and then another and another,''
Garcia said. ``That's the way life works.''
</P>
<P>
   The last basketball player at New Mexico with a Latino surname
was J.J. Griego, a small forward from Socorro, a little town in New
Mexico. Latinos throughout the state followed Griego's success and
he became a hero in the community. Now a successful businessman in
Albuquerque, Griego was preceded by Nick Pinos, a star for the
Lobos in the 1970s who was later killed during a robbery.
</P>
<P>
   In New Mexico, Griego and Pinos were idolized in the largely
Hispanic population, in which anyone who plays for the Lobos
already has celebrity status.
</P>
<P>
   Many predict that Berumen will have a similar affect.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make a positive
impact within the Hispanic community _ along with all the other
communities,'' said Vince Garcia, a local businessmen who hosted
the Berumens last September. ``The time I spent with Rafael and his
family, he seemed to be an exemplary citizen who is acutely aware
of his position. Certainly, he brings so much to the table. He can
truly serve as a role model for this community and the whole state.
We can't wait until he gets here.''

FALCONS SAY ROBINSON ARREST WAS A DISTRACTION ON GAME DAY
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Some members of the Atlanta Falcons said Monday they
were not surprised when their teammate, Eugene Robinson, was
arrested for soliciting an undercover police officer for sex in a
seedy section of Miami the night before Super Bowl XXXIII. After
all, some of them said, other Falcons players had been there
several times for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys had been going there all week,'' said one Falcon starter.
``It's just that Eugene was the only one who got caught.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews after the game and on Monday morning, several
Falcon starters spoke about Robinson's arrest and its affect on the
team. They insisted on anonymity because of their concern that
their comments could be divisive to a team that hopes to return to
the Super Bowl next season.
</P>
<P>
   While they said they were unsure how many players went to the
area north of downtown frequented by prostitutes, they estimated it
was at least five, some of them starters.
</P>
<P>
   The players said Robinson heard from teammates about the area
and, the players added, ``he wanted to see it for himself.'' Miami
police said Robinson offered an undercover officer $40 for oral sex
on Saturday night. Robinson said he is innocent of the charge, but
he apologized to his teammates and his family, saying he did not
``maintain the high standards for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   While publicly the Falcons players maintained Robinson's arrest
was not a distraction, privately they said differently. Those
interviewed said the morning of the game was extremely tense, and
all the talk was about Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of getting mentally ready for the Broncos,'' said
another Falcons player, ``we were talking about Eugene. The Broncos
beat us, but anyone who says what happened to Eugene was not a
factor is lying.''
</P>
<P>
   Falcons players said the team did not play its normally sharp
game, and that there were numerous blown blocking assignments and
botched secondary coverages.
</P>
<P>
   The comments from Atlanta players were part of an extensive
postmortem following Atlanta's 34-19 loss. The Falcons had entered
the game as one of the hottest teams in the National Football
League, after upsetting the heavily favored Minnesota Vikings on
the road. They had a potent offense led by quarterback Chris
Chandler and running back Jamal Anderson, and a solid defense as
well.
</P>
<P>
   They figured to give the Broncos a much better game, especially
considering running back Terrell Davis was playing with a sore
groin and tight end Shannon Sharpe tore a ligament in his knee in
the opening quarter and did not return. The Falcons could not have
asked for a better situation.
</P>
<P>
   But something happened. The team that became one of the best
stories in the league, one that had shown the cool, killer
instincts of a champion against the San Francisco 49ers and the
Vikings in the playoffs, did not have its mental edge against
Denver. The Falcons got inside Denver's 30-yard line seven times
but managed only two field goals and a touchdown. During the
regular season, Atlanta scored 27 touchdowns and 14 field goals in
46 chances inside the red zone. Of the five missed opportunities,
four were the Falcons quarterback taking a knee to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Atlanta's problems had to do with the Broncos, of
course. Coach Mike Shanahan threw things at the Falcons they were
not expecting and quarterback John Elway was a dazzling 18 of 29
for 336 yards. Denver's defense sacked Chandler twice and
intercepted him three times. No doubt, the Broncos were the better
team.
</P>
<P>
   But were they over two touchdowns better? The Falcons say no and
privately they pointed to several things during the week that were
distractions in addition to Robinson's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons players interviewed said the fact that families were
allowed to travel and stay with the team _ something few teams
allow _ was a novel idea, but proved to be a major distraction in
some cases. Some Falcons players were inundated with requests from
family members for things like tickets and hotel rooms for
relatives. By comparison, the families of Broncos players were not
allowed to stay with the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your family is going to become really important,'' said
Robinson before the game. ``Everybody in your family is going to
want your time. They're going to bug you for everything, and you
have to realize the distraction and make sure you get your work
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson bluntly stated after the game, ``Having families in the
hotel became a hassle to some guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Falcons players also said that their living situation
reminded them more of a compound than a hotel. Players could not
receive phone calls directly in their rooms. Instead, all calls
were routed to a receptionist, who took a message. Security at the
hotel was extremely tight, and several friends of players, who
tried to visit _ including some agents _ were turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Some Falcons players think all of these things are just excuses.
``There is no way we're going to turn our backs on our teammate in
an adverse situation,'' said linebacker Jessie Tuggle, speaking of
Robinson. ``As a team, this wasn't a distraction. I think it made
us stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has taken the loss harder than Reeves, who is now only
the third coach in league history to go winless in four Super
Bowls. His teams have been outscored, 170-59, in Super Bowl games.
The Falcons were a wonderful story this season, especially for
Reeves, who had heart surgery but returned to the sideline after
five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Robinson arrest followed by the loss have put a
damper on the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't get any easier,'' Reeves said of the Super Bowl
losses. ``I think the more you have, of those losses, the more you
hurt.''

KOO KOO ROO STOCK DELISTED BY NASDAQ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Editors: Today in 2nd graf refers to Tuesday.)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ Koo Koo Roo Enterprises Inc., the operator of a
far-flung restaurant chain, said Monday its stock is being delisted
by the Nasdaq exchange after a panel overturned a waiver to the $5
minimum bid requirement.
</P>
<P>
   The company, whose holdings include the Koo Koo Roo, Hamburger
Hamlet, Chi Chi's and El Torito chains, will start trading today on
the OTC exchange under the ticker symbol KKRE.
</P>
<P>
   Koo Koo Roo was first listed on the Nasdaq in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin S. Relyea, the company's chairman, chief executive officer
and president, said the ruling will not impact ongoing operations.
</P>
<P>
   Koo Koo Roo bought the Hamburger Hamlet chain in 1997 and 13
weeks ago merged with privately held Family Restaurants Inc., owner
of the Mexican-themed restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last several months have been involved in getting the two
companies together and understanding the operations down to the
nitty-gritty detail,'' said Robert L. Carl, Koo Koo Roo's vice
president for investor relations. ``I think we pretty much
inherited an excellent opportunity for growth.''
</P>
<P>
   But Douglas J. Burke, director of private placements for
investment house Sutro &AMP; Co., said that ``micro-cap'' restaurant
companies like Koo Koo Roo, those with a market capitalization of
less than $150 million, are finding themselves in a tight financial
spot these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is flowing rapidly out of mutual funds that specialize
in stocks with a market cap of less than $150 million,'' he said.
``Other large investors are also turning away from these micro-cap
stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Koo Koo Roo operates 58 restaurants in Los Angeles and Ventura
County. The Irvine-based company has more than 20,000 employees at
300 restaurants scattered across 28 states.

PLAN AIRED TO RESTRUCTURE GRUPO TELEVISA DEBT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The owners of Grupo Televisa SA, the largest
television conglomerate in the Spanish-speaking world, announced a
plan on Monday to restructure their debt.
</P>
<P>
   Televisa will put up $230 million in cash to buy some of its
stock from its holding company, Grupo Televicentro SA de CV, along
with other notes that will bring Televisa substantial tax breaks.
Televisa is also undertaking a separate $50 million stock
repurchase program.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the measures, if they are approved by Mexican
regulators, will reduce Televicentro's debts by $733 million, to
$533 million. The remaining debt has been extended to three to five
years.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Grupo Televisa has been as packed with intrigue as
the nighttime soap operas it is famous for producing and
broadcasting to countries worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The company's young chairman, Emilio Azcarraga Jean, who is 30,
has campaigned to modernize the company, which created the
television shows that most Mexicans grew up with. But he had to
scramble to hang on to Televisa after the death in April 1997 of
his father, Emilio Azcarraga Milmo, who had built Televisa by
extravagant methods.
</P>
<P>
   Azcarraga Jean, who had little financial experience, took out
large bank loans through Grupo Televicentro to buy stock from
relatives and large shareholders who had been close to his father.
But the decline of the Latin American markets in 1998 sank the
stock price and left his holding company with more than $1.3
billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Delays by Azcarraga Jean in confronting the debt gave rise to
worries on Wall Street that he might lose control of Televisa.
There were also fears that he might shore up Televisa in ways that
would help the Azcarraga family but hurt the public shareholders,
who are in the minority.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts were satisfied on Monday that Azcarraga Jean had
found a plan to reduce Televicentro's debts, assuage bankers and
assure other stockholders that his plan was also fair to them.
Televisa shares rose by 6 pesos, or 4.7 percent, to 134 pesos,
here. Its American depository receipts rose 43.75 cents, to
$26.0625, on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Azcarraga Jean said in an interview that he hoped the measures
would help bolster the sagging price of Televisa stock.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Grupo Televisa said Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
had been brought in to certify that all shares would be sold
between the two companies at market price. ``Nothing was done that
was not at fair value,'' said Matthew Harrigan, who follows
Televisa for J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   The company's problems are by no means solved, and executives
said they continue to weigh a number of options, such as taking on
a strategic partner. But Azcarraga Jean, who retains 50.3 percent
of the voting control of Televicentro, sounded on Monday like a man
who was at least beginning to master the intricacies of the world
into which he was thrust.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a huge effort to cut costs and expenses last year, and
it is working well for us,'' he said. ``We are creating more value
for our shareholders.''

 &HT;    Fundraiser for Florida aquarium turns into eyebrow-raiser
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Muffy Matthews leaned close to the glass case
enclosing 400-year-old treasure salvaged off a sunken Spanish
galleon, eyeballed a $1.2 million gold and diamond suite of jewels,
elbowed her friend and announced:
</P>
<P>
   ``You want the saber toothpick and I`ll take the Neptune
doubloon.''
</P>
<P>
   And so began the first day of a rather unusual sale to raise
money for a proposed aquarium in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   About 250 invitation-only guests squeezed into Mary Mahoney's
Worth Avenue boutique Monday to view jewelry, bowls, a rosary, and
several painful looking grooming devices rescued from the bottom of
the sea by treasure hunter Mel Fisher. What a long way for the
former chicken farmer, who gazed upon the Pellegrino-drinking,
canape-eating throng from a 1980 photograph of him draped in gold
from the Atocha, and displayed in a case with the artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   For the crusty Fisher, home was more frequently a Key West bar
stool.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was his idea,'' said Fisher's son, Kim, who took over
family businesses after Fisher died in December.
</P>
<P>
   Before his death, Fisher gave $1.4 million in treasure to
aquarium developer Duane Boise to help get the project off the
ground. Since then, the family has pledged another $19 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love the ocean and we think it's very important to educate
people about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Boise organized the sale with Mahoney's brother, Tom Ryan, a
salvor enthusiast who befriended Fisher before his death and
introduced him to Boise. The treasures _ including a $120,000
boatswain whistle Fisher once blew in federal court after Judge
James Lawrence King awarded him title _ and a $1.2 million gold
spoon, will be displayed through Thursday. Five percent of the
proceeds will go to the aquarium, Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   The family's contribution could mark the first step in what
would be a complicated effort to raise enough money to build the
4.8-acre project in CityPlace.
</P>
<P>
   Boise first proposed the Gulf Stream-themed aquarium for Riviera
Beach, but the city pulled his contract for land after he failed to
raise enough money. Boise has sued. About eight months ago, he
began talking with CityPlace builders and Monday released an
overview of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the $52 million aquarium will depend upon tax-exempt
revenue bonds to pay its way, said Robert T. O'Connor, the
aquarium's director of development and finance.
</P>
<P>
   Boise won't say who would issue the revenue bonds, but Monday
Palm Beach County officials suggested it won't be the county.
</P>
<P>
   ``The county commission, I think, will look at this no
differently than the arena downtown,'' said Commissioner Mary
McCarty.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, county officials refused to support a $55 million
bond issue unless the aquarium developers raised $15 million
privately.
</P>
<P>
   In August they pledged to support a $55 million arena on
Clematis Street if, among other conditions, the developer finds
private investors and provides a letter of credit to guarantee the
county's $1 million a year donation from parking and sales tax
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big challenge, and it's a nice dream,'' McCarty said.
</P>
<P>
   Kajima International, a Los Angeles company that built the
money-losing Tampa aquarium, is developing the project, according
to Boise. More recently, Kajima completed a more successful
attraction in Long Beach, Calif., that boosted that city's
revitalization efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Mel Fisher always liked to say, ``Today's the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, who in his last days engaged in a legal battle over the
authenticity of his treasure, fell in love with the aquarium
project when told about plans for an exhibit on treasure salvors,
said family attorney Gene Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``What attracted the Fishers to the aquarium project was the
fact that what the aquarium proposes to do is something I don't
believe another aquarium in the U.S. does: They're going to set up
an actual working laboratory, a conservation laboratory within the
aquarium itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The developer and family have talked to state officials about
money to create a center for artifacts found in state waters that
would include a mini-recreation of the Atocha's mother lode, Lewis
said. Visitors would watch as divers re-enact the salvage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Fisher believes the exhibit would be a fitting memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Before he died, Fisher was plagued with challenges to his finds
after he sold several coins purchased from a subcontractor claiming
they were from a 1733 wreck. After one customer complained, others
stepped forward. The Monroe County State Attorney's Office began an
investigation that led to fraud charges and ultimately a
settlement. Fisher pleaded no contest to the charges and promised
to pay back dissatisfied customers. So far, $100,000 has been
repaid to 15 customers and seven more have filed complaints, said
investigator Paul Meyers.
</P>
<P>
   All the items of treasure being sold to help the aquarium _ and
the other $1.4 million donated by Fisher in November _ are from the
Atocha and a 1715 wreck off Sebastian, which have been
authenticated in federal court, Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the treasure exhibit, Boise said the aquarium
will feature a 1.5 million gallon tank, a West Africa exhibit with
a pair of hippopotamuses and spider monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when we have the aquarium,'' Fisher's daughter, Taffi,
said as she set up a display case Monday, ``next time we catch a
pirate we're going to throw him in the shark tank.''

NETS' GATLING HAS AN ASSIGNMENT TO SCORE
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the job description from heaven. Whether Chris Gatling is
open, in the flow of the game or fresh off the bench, he has Coach
John Calipari's permission to try to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing he does is score,'' Calipari said of the Nets'
6-foot-10-inch forward from Elizabeth, N.J. ``If he plays 25
minutes, he's getting 15 to 18 to 20 points.''
</P>
<P>
   Gatling, a sixth man, scored 18 points in 28 minutes of the
Nets' 92-90 exhibition victory over the Knicks on Friday. And
although he scored the game-winning points on a baby hook and free
throw with 21 seconds remaining, the most impressive part of his
game was his outside shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The new range is a result of Gatling's determination in the
off-season to increase his versatility. Like most big scorers, he
was looking for another path to the points column. Already adept at
driving, hitting hooks and turnarounds, Gatling decided to move to
the perimeter. He continues to hone his touch by working with some
of the Nets' most reliable shooters at practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to be a great shooter, you have to shoot with the
best shooters,'' said Gatling, who averaged 11.5 points a game last
season as Keith Van Horn's backup. ``I try to shoot with Brian
Evans. I try to shoot with Keith. I try to shoot with Lucious
Harris, Kerry Kittles. What better way to learn than to learn with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gatling's coaches and teammates are raving about more than
his ability to step outside. The Nets were pleasantly surprised
when Gatling, 31, arrived at training camp in the best shape of his
life.
</P>
<P>
   Gatling's sense of urgency came during the summer, when he had
bone spurs removed from his left ankle. The surgery was in
September, and Gatling, assuming the season would start on time,
was afraid of missing the beginning of the year. Motivated by his
fear, he underwent rehabilitation with his personal trainer, George
Abrams, in hopes of playing 82 games.
</P>
<P>
   When the lockout delayed the season, Gatling continued his
varied regimen of lifting weights, riding bikes, working on a
treadmill, sprinting up hills and playing tennis, racquetball and
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the year and a half he's been with me, he's never been in
this type of shape,'' Calipari said.
</P>
<P>
   Calipari is now asking Gatling to extend his responsibilities.
In addition to putting the ball up, Calipari wants Gatling to shut
his opponent down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I'm saying to him is you have to do two things _
guard and rebound,'' Calipari said. ``Then do what you always do.
But if you don't guard and rebound, if you don't block out, it
negates what you're doing offensively.''

NORTHEASTERN TOPS HARVARD IN OVERTIME AND GAINS BEANPOT FINAL
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Will be led with results of second game.) 
 (ms) 
 By WILLIAM N. WALLACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Northeastern defeated Harvard, 4-3, in overtime Monday
night in the first game of the Beanpot Tournament, Boston's
midwinter salute to college hockey. Brian Cummings, a sophomore
right wing, scored the winning goal 4 minutes 35 seconds into
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern advanced to the tournament final, to be played at
the Fleet Center next Monday night, for the first time since 1996.
The Huskies last won the Beanpot in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The score was tied after one period and Northeastern led, 3-2,
after two. Then Matt Scorsune, a Harvard defenseman, tied the score
at 3-3 with five seconds left in regulation time.
</P>
<P>
   Scorsune's 20-foot slap shot went through a screen and past
Jason Braun, Northeastern's goalie. The Crimson had six skaters on
the ice and an empty goal in the final minute, and Braun had made
two stops before the tying goal.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard continued to press in the overtime until Cummings
punched a shot past J.R. Prestifilippo, the Crimson goaltender.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College and Boston University met in the second contest.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College (16-8-2) is the only one of the four teams with a
winning record. Boston University (8-14-2), which has won the last
four Beanpot Tournaments, is in the middle of a rare losing season,
and Northeastern (9-13-2), a young team with no seniors and only
four juniors, is struggling as well.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Monday night's loss, Harvard (8-10-1) had bounced back
from a horrendous beginning and won six of its last eight games.
The Crimson, tied for 10th place in the ECAC standings, has won all
five of its nonleague contests and two were victories over
competitors here _ Boston University by 5-3 last Nov. 24 and Boston
College by 3-1, on Jan. 13.

RANGERS DOMINATED BY A WEAKER OPPONENT AT HOME
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Should the Rangers fail to make the playoffs again
this season, they will be haunted by games like Monday night's
against the Washington Capitals. Games played at home against
weaker opponents should not be a struggle at this crucial point in
the season. And these games should not end in defeat.
</P>
<P>
   But that was exactly what happened at Madison Square Garden,
where the Rangers were dominated by the lowly Washington Capitals,
who defeated them by 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   A victory would have put the Rangers (19-22-7) back in the thick
of the playoff race, just a point behind the idle Florida Panthers
and Boston Bruins in the East. Washington improved its record to
17-26-4.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers pressed for the game-tying goal late in the third
period, but a goal by Peter Bondra with three minutes left ended
any threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have won the game; there's no excuses, let's be
honest,'' Rangers Coach John Muckler said afterward. ``You think
you're in a favorable position against teams we should beat, but
this is not the first time we've taken two steps back when we
should have taken a step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers wasted an outstanding performance by goalie Mike
Richter, who, one game after saving the Rangers against the Detroit
Red Wings, kept his team in Monday night's match with an array of
brilliant saves.
</P>
<P>
   Richter's best stop was on Bondra in the third period, when he
poked the puck away from the Capitals' sniper on a breakaway.
Richter had 35 saves while his counterpart Olaf Kolzig was tough to
beat, too, stopping 24 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gretzky missed the final 16 minutes of last Saturday's 3-2
victory over the Red Wings when he aggravated an old rib injury. He
had insisted that the injury would not cause him to miss Monday
night's game, but the soreness persisted Monday morning. So, he
decided to take warmups 30 minutes prior to the game before
choosing whether to play.
</P>
<P>
   During the warm-ups, Gretzky looked stiff and seemed to be in
some pain, skating slowly and grimacing every time he handled the
puck. He was on the ice for only about five minutes before exiting.
</P>
<P>
   To everyone's surprise, Gretzky toughed it out. He was cautious
in the opening minutes of the first period. But a cautious Gretzky
is still better than most NHL forwards. And, surprisingly, he
played very well in the game's first 20 minutes. He set up several
chances and even threw a few body checks.
</P>
<P>
   There were several factors that may have affected Gretzky's
decision to play. He had not missed a game since joining the
Rangers three seasons ago, playing in all 212 regular-season games
and 15 playoff games. And Gretzky, the NHL's all-time scoring
leader, is nearing two milestones. He needs eight goals to reach
900 for his career and is one point short of his 1,071st point,
which would tie him with Gordie Howe for all-time points in the NHL
and World Hockey Association combined.
</P>
<P>
   Despite controlling the game on both ends of the ice through the
opening 20 minutes, New York trailed Washington by 1-0 at the first
intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Konawalchuk scored for the Capitals at 2:35, batting the
puck from out of midair and past Richter, who had made an initial
save but didn't close his glove on the puck.
</P>
<P>
   In the second period, John MacLean of the Rangers misfired on a
wide open net as the puck dribbled across Kolzig's goal line. But
Brent Fedyk beat Kolzig moments later, scoring his first goal of
the season to tie the game at 6:10. Fedyk pumped his fists as if he
had scored the game-winner. But who could blame him? His first was
long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   The Garden crowd was still cheering the Rangers' goal when Joe
Juneau scored for the Capitals 25 seconds later, whipping a slap
shot over Richter's glove. Adam Oates set up Juneau by passing the
puck to him with a kick of his skate.

 &HT;    Beached whale clinging to life
 &HT;    By Sally D. Swartz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT PIERCE, Fla. _ A pygmy sperm whale that washed ashore at
Melbourne Beach clung to life Monday as volunteers held his head
above water in an above-ground pool at Harbor Branch Oceanographic
Institution.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first whale rescue for Harbor Branch, which just
opened a marine mammal emergency care center north of Fort Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-foot whale beached himself about 6 p.m. Sunday and
Department of Environmental Protection staff stayed with him until
about 11 p.m. A Sea World truck took the whale to Harbor Branch.
</P>
<P>
   The whale is very thin, said Steve Lang, a former Sea World and
Marineland employee who came from Orlando to help care for the
animal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Healthy whales don't beach themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers tube-fed the whale and gave it antibiotics, but Lang
held out little hope it will survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we let go of him, he sinks to the bottom and doesn't want
to come up,'' said Suzanne Leffew, director of institutional
relations. Leffew is one of more than a dozen Harbor Branch
employees who took two-hour shifts in the pool or did other work to
help the whale.
</P>
<P>
   The animal may be moved to a Florida International University
pool in Miami, the only other emergency care facility on the east
coast, if it is alive today, Leffew said.
</P>
<P>
   Harbor Branch's Dolphin Research Center staff organized the
primitive emergency care center after Orlando's Sea World stopped
taking beached whales and dolphins and St. Augustine's Marineland
closed down.
</P>
<P>
   Sea World has stopped caring for wild marine mammals, fearing
they might have a virus that attacks the immune systems of whales
and dolphins, said Craig Pelton, who is with the Marine Animal
Rescue Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't compromise their captive populations,'' Pelton
said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Marine Fisheries Service helped Harbor Branch set
up the small pool, which is about 20 feet wide and 4 feet deep,
said Steve McCulloch, Harbor Branch's dolphin program director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing this on a shoestring,'' McCulloch said.
</P>
<P>
   Money from a new ``Protect Wild Dolphin'' specialty auto license
tag, which goes on sale in April, could help pay for a new
facility. But private donations also are needed, McCulloch said.
</P>
<P>
   Harbor Branch will be in charge of distributing money raised
through tag sales for marine mammal research and rescue projects
throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   Setting up a state-of-the-art pool to care for sick marine
mammals could cost $5 million initially and $1 million annually to
operate, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Harbor Branch experts rigged the small pool with a pump
to draw water from a salt water well, heat it and filter it. Others
padded the outside of the pool with foam rubber to buffer the noise
of a heater blower. The sound, magnified by the water, could
further stress the animal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harbor Branch has tremendous technical resources,'' McCulloch
said, ``and everyone has been great about helping out. It has been
a real team effort.''

ANALYSTS EXPECT TEKELEC GAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: Today in 1st, 4th grafs refers to Tuesday.) 
By BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALABASAS, Calif. _ After a year that saw its sales increase by
nearly 50 percent, telecommunications network equipment maker
Tekelec is expected to report a healthy gain in fourth-quarter and
year-end earnings today.
</P>
<P>
   A consensus of five analysts surveyed by First Call project the
company will report fourth quarter earnings of 19 cents per share,
a 19 percent gain over the same period a year ago. For the year,
analysts expect earnings of 60 cents per share, a 71 percent gain
over 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fourth quarter (increase) might not be as explosive (as
the annual gain), but still they've had a big uptick,'' said
analyst Tim Savageaux at Volpe Brown Whelan in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Tekelec said it will announce results after the close of U.S.
stock markets today.
</P>
<P>
   Having struggled for market share throughout the 1990s,
supplying mostly smaller and newcomer telecom operators, Tekelec
emerged in 1998 as a recognized if still relatively minor supplier
to blue chip firms. That was highlighted in October when the
company, northwest of downtown Los Angeles, landed a contract to
sell Sprint between $4 million and $5 million worth of switching
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Together, gains in the two ends of the market pushed Tekelec's
sales up markedly. In the first three quarters, for example, the
company had revenues of $127.5 million, compared to $81.76 million
in the same period a year earlier and to $125 million for all of
1997.
</P>
<P>
   But for all its success in growing the business, Tekelec saw its
share price battered around in 1998, dipping to a low of just over
$10 in late summer from a high of more than $25 in April. The
company closed Monday at $21.4375, up $1.4375.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts ascribed the dips in large part to collateral damage
from other telecom equipment makers missing their earnings
estimates. Savageaux has a 12-month target price on Tekelec shares
of $30.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an extremely significant year for them,'' he said.

AMERICA ONLINE TO BUY MOVIEFONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Calif., Ill., Mass.) (lb) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moviefone is hooking up with the ``You've got mail'' man.
</P>
<P>
   America Online said Monday that it had agreed to buy Moviefone
Inc. for stock valued at $388 million, linking two companies
notable for their sonorous spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
   Moviefone provides movie show times and sells tickets through
the 777-FILM telephone service and the Moviefone.com Internet site.
Most of its $20 million in annual revenue represents advertising
from movie studios promoting films. But about 20 percent of its
sales come from commissions on tickets bought through the service.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the latest in an aggressive expansion effort by
America Online, which has agreed to buy a range of Internet-related
companies, most recently Netscape Communication Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Moviefone acquisition is a departure of sorts for
America Online, which has mainly served as an advertising medium
for other companies that do business online.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time that America Online has bought
something that can be considered a commerce company,'' said Keith
Benjamin, an analyst with BancBoston Robertson Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Schuler, the president of America Online's flagship
service, said that the company wants to make acquisitions in areas
in which electronic commerce will be important.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really like businesses where the online medium will
transform them in the future,'' he said. ``And we think that movies
are the sort of thing that people will be doing online more and
more.''
</P>
<P>
   America Online said it would promote Moviefone prominently on
its various online services, especially Digital Cities, its network
of local guides. The Moviefone.com site will be expanded to include
more information about films, creating more positions for
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, which is based in Dulles, Va., also wants to
expand the service to offer ticketing for live events as well as
movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that electronic ticketing has a lot of upside and is
at its very early stages,'' Schuler said.
</P>
<P>
   That would open another front of competition with Ticketmaster
Online-Citysearch Inc., the company that recently combined
operations of the United States' leading live-event ticketing
service with a local-information Internet service. The company is
controlled by USA Networks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Schuler said America Online saw an opportunity to
use Moviefone's phone line and links to theaters as a way to
promote the America Online brand. The service will be renamed AOL
Moviefone.
</P>
<P>
   Moviefone, which is based in New York, sells tickets for about
4,000 of the nation's 27,000 movie screens, though it represents
about 60 percent of the screens in the five biggest markets: New
York, Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco. In New York,
it has a reciprocal promotion arrangement with The New York Times,
among others.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Andrew Jarecki, Moviefone's chief executive, said he had been
looking to sell the business to an Internet company for several
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought that the Internet would be an important
part of our business, but I've been surprised by how tremendously
fast it has grown,'' he said, adding that 25 percent of the 3
million Moviefone users each week already use the company's World
Wide Web site rather than its phone service.
</P>
<P>
   Moviefone shares trade on the Nasdaq market, but the Jarecki
family controls 73 percent of the company's equity and 92 percent
of its votes. For the quarter ended Sept. 30, 1998, the company
showed a loss of $920,000 on revenue of $5.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The deal values Moviefone at $29.25 a share. With rumors of a
deal swirling on Monday, the company's shares closed up $1.50, to
$26.50, after trading as high as $33. America Online's shares fell
$4.5625, to $171.1875, on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   For America Online, analysts said, the high price of its stock
allows acquisitions on advantageous terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will see even more consolidation like this,'' said David
Readerman, an analyst with Thomas Weisel Partners in San Francisco.
``The leaders want to bulk up so the strong will get stronger.''

MURDER CHARGE DISMISSED IN INFANT DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ANGELES, Wash. _ Prosecutors Monday dismissed a
second-degree murder charge against Dr. Eugene Turner in the death
of an infant under his care, but troubles still lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Turner still faces possible disciplinary action _ which could
include the loss of his license _ and the parents of the
three-day-old infant say they will file a civil lawsuit against
him.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by an outside prosecutor to drop the charges
against the popular doctor prompted a burst of cheers from his
supporters in the crowded Clallam County courthouse. Turner and
friends later poured champagne to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm relieved,'' he said between hugs.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said he never gave up hope that the charge, filed in
October by Clallam County's former prosecutor, David Bruneau, would
be dropped ``once people saw the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the infant's parents, Michelle and Martin McInnerney,
said in a statement through their attorney that they were
disheartened by the decision and ``will continue to do everything
we can to see justice for Conor ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Turner had been accused of stopping Conor's breathing with his
hand on Jan. 12, 1998. The infant was declared dead twice after he
stopped breathing at home and was brought to the Olympic Memorial
Hospital emergency room by ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said the breathing he stopped was reflexive ``agonal
breathing'' that is a sign of imminent death _ that the infant was
already brain-dead.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Knopp, the attorney for the McInnerneys, said Turner's
conduct ``was simply wrong. Marty and Michelle will always be
haunted by the image of what Dr. Turner did while he was alone with
Conor that night.''
</P>
<P>
   Knopp said the couple will file a civil action against Turner. A
$1.5 million civil claim was filed last summer against Olympic
Memorial Hospital where 3-day-old Conor was rushed by emergency
medics on a dark and snowy January night more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   While Turner, 62, will continue to practice medicine at the
children's clinic he founded here nearly 30 years ago, his wife,
Norma, acknowledged that her husband still faces a review by the
state Medical Quality Assurance Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, the commission charged Turner with unprofessional
conduct, accusing him of lowering the esteem of his profession. He
also is accused of incompetence that resulted in an injury and
abuse of a client. A hearing is set for May 26.
</P>
<P>
   The panel could clear Turner or impose sanctions, ranging from
remedial steps _ such as working with another doctor to improve his
work _ to revocation of his physician's license.
</P>
<P>
   The commission already has ordered Turner not to recuscitate a
patient without another physician present, and that ruling is still
in force.
</P>
<P>
   Commission spokesman Matt Ashworth said the dismissal of the
criminal charge will be taken into account by the panel, but that
its review is a separate proceeding in which protecting the public
is paramount.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said Monday that he believes evidence gathered for the
trial will help before the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can have some evidence to bring forth to the state
board to indicate that things were maybe not as bad as they
originally thought they were,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   With that evidence, ``it will be easier for us and them to come
up with a conclusion which I think will allow everybody to get back
to the business at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unknown when, or if, Turner will reclaim his privilege to
practice medicine at Olympic Memorial Hospital _ a privilege he
voluntarily gave up last year.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for her husband Monday afternoon, Norma Turner said
they intend to continue ``taking it one day at a time as we have
for the last year. This is all new territory for us.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Monday that family and friends ``are celebrating today,
but he's going back to work tomorrow, as he has all year.''
</P>
<P>
   One sentence told it all Monday in Clallam County Superior
Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time,'' said Snohomish County's Chief Criminal
Prosecutor Jim Townsend, ``the state moves toward dismissal without
prejudice.'' The phrase means the murder charge against the doctor
is dismissed, but could be brought again should new evidence come
to light.
</P>
<P>
   Townsend's words brought tears and flushed grins to the faces of
the Turners.
</P>
<P>
   Cloaked in controversy and widely publicized, Turner's troubles
began on a snowy night a little more than a year ago. Conor stopped
breathing while nursing at home and was rushed to the emergency
room of Olympic Memorial Hospital. Attending physicians failed to
revive him and neither could Turner.
</P>
<P>
   The child eventually was pronounced dead and placed on a warming
tray to await the coroner. But he later showed signs of life.
Turner again was called to revive the boy, but failed again even as
the infant showed fleeting signs of life.
</P>
<P>
   Finally _ and this became the issue that would crystalize the
case for the Clallam County prosecutor _ Turner placed a hand over
the infant's nose and mouth to stop what he later would describe as
the last ``agonal'' gasps of an already brain dead infant.
</P>
<P>
   In his review of the special prosecutors' finding Monday,
visiting Judge Michael Rickert of Skagit County said Turner did
what any other reasonable person in his position might be expected
to do. But he added that ``Turner's choice was not the usual
option.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner's trial was set to begin here Jan. 25, but was delayed a
week while the Snohomish County prosecutor's office continued a
review of the case. Snohomish County Prosecutor Jim Krider was
given full charge of the case after the defeat in November's
election of then prosecutor Bruneau, who filed the murder charge in
October.
</P>
<P>
   At a special hearing after the election, the newly elected
prosecutor, Christopher Shea, said he would not have time to review
the case after taking office on Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting Townsend's motion Monday, Rickert said the evidence
against the doctor was not strong enough to merit either murder or
manslaughter charges. Moreover, medical experts cited by both the
prosecution and defense disagreed to such an extent that a trial
would not resolve the differences. Further, there was no evidence
of criminality ``or even negligence,'' Rickert said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference later, Snohomish Prosecutor Krider said
Conor was not dead as defined by state law because his brain stem
was still directing a breathing response.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that wasn't breathing as you or I know it,'' Krider said,
declining to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   When Rickert signed Townsend's dismissal motion, the courtroom
erupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're real happy for Dr. Turner, that's for sure,'' said Ken
Simpson, a Port Angeles electrician. He had come to the courthouse
with his wife, Heidi. The couple have two boys, ages 5 and 7. At
age 18 months, the youngest nearly died of pneumonia, but Turner
pulled him through, Simpson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a special place in our hearts for Dr. Turner,'' he
said.

KNICKS' COACH TELLS CHILDS TO IGNORE TRADE RUMORS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Jeff Van Gundy calls it clutter: the
thoughts and distractions that have occupied the mind of Chris
Childs since he came to the Knicks two years ago from across the
river. To succeed, the Knick coach tells Childs that he must rid
his mind of the clutter.
</P>
<P>
   But it is easy to understand how Childs could be preoccupied.
Almost from the moment he left the Nets and signed as a free agent
with the Knicks for six years and nearly $24 million, he has been
the subject of trade rumors. And Childs has absorbed more blame
than any player outside of Patrick Ewing for the Knicks' failure to
catch Michael Jordan and the Bulls and win a National Basketball
Association title.
</P>
<P>
   Childs was demoted from the starting lineup last season in favor
of Charlie Ward, which helped Ward gain a big contract this year,
but did little to justify his own contract. And neither Ward nor
Childs has been able to perform to the level of guards such as Rod
Strickland, Tim Hardaway, Mark Jackson or Stephon Marbury.
</P>
<P>
   When Childs' season ended last spring against the Indiana Pacers
as the scapegoat for Reggie Miller's last-second heroics, he went
home to California and could not shield himself from the rumors
that that was his last series as a Knick.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to simply concentrate on basketball, but not with a
particular idea of where he would be playing.
</P>
<P>
   No clutter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a stance of whatever happens, happens,'' Childs said
after the first of two practices Monday. ``There is going to be a
time in everybody's career that they're put out there as trade
bait. This was the second year in a row for me. You get used to it
by now. I worked out, ran a lot. I wasn't worried about anything
management was doing. I was just worried about getting myself
mentally back into the game of basketball like I need to.''
</P>
<P>
   With the players locked out, Childs knew that his status with
the Knicks would be in limbo. But if the uncertainty might have
bothered some players, Childs has endured shakier moments in his
life and career, spending five years in the Continental Basketball
Association before he finally stuck in the NBA, and enduring a bout
with alcoholism that nearly cost him his chance.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy said: ``The trade rumors, 99 percent of them are
false, and if you're any good in this league, like Chris obviously
is, people want you so there is always going to be rumors. But also
even if it is true, there is nothing you can do about it, so why
worry?''
</P>
<P>
   When the lockout ended, John Starks, Chris Mills, and Terry
Cummings were dealt to Golden State. Childs was rumored to be gone,
but the Warriors passed on him. And now Childs not only has
returned, but with an increased role. In Starks' absence, Childs
will not only be the backup point guard, but will play alongside
Ward at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our point guards have been much maligned because
they're not your new-wave NBA point guards that think shot first,
pass second,'' Van Gundy said. ``If you look at them statistically
as a combination, what they bring to 48 minutes of the game and not
individually, they're very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Starks, Childs has his share of flaws. Coming from the Nets
where he was the first offensive option after displacing Kenny
Anderson as the starter, he never was as ready as Ward to serve as
a caddie to Ewing. He missed 17 games his first year in New York
and 14 last season with an assortment of injuries. Whatever the
role now, he said he is more mature and ready to be a piece of the
puzzle, and has played through a strained groin during the last two
days of practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I've always respected about Chris, I say this to
him all the time, there is not one time I've ever had to get on
Chris about more effort,'' Van Gundy said. ``He plays hard. He
practices hard.''

<P>
   DENVER _ ``Three-peat'' was the word of the day as more than
300,000 fans gathered in downtown Denver Monday to greet the
Broncos, two-time winners of the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd packed sidewalks for a parade that, like Atlanta's,
brought the team through downtown streets aboard fire trucks to a
rally at a park in the heart of the city. As the players were
introduced, fans chanted ``three-peat, three-peat.''
</P>
<P>
   They also reveled in the chance to get in a few more digs at the
defeated Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``How sweet it is,'' Colorado Gov. Bill Owens told the team.
``Thank you for putting those Dirty Birds to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   As clouds parted to let the sun shine on the parade and rally,
the emcees for the event told the fans that it was ``raining
tears'' on Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour parade and rally was about half the length of last
year's, when the Broncos got their first Super Bowl title, and it
almost didn't happen. City officials last week had rejected the
idea, only to change their minds after a public outcry fueled in
part by Atlanta's announcement that it planned a parade and rally
for the Falcons, win or lose.
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl MVP Dan Elway, who is contemplating retirement,
teased the crowd by acknowledging he is tempted by the thought of
winning three Super Bowls in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``That three-peat does sound interesting,'' Elway said with a
grin. ``We'll talk about it later.''
</P>
<P>
   Reggie White, in Hawaii for his record 11th Pro Bowl appearance,
is preparing to strap on the shoulder pads one last time.
</P>
<P>
   Or is he?
</P>
<P>
   White insisted all year that this was his final season, and at
37, he had a great farewell, garnering 16 sacks and the NFL
Defensive Player of the Year award.
</P>
<P>
   Like Michael Jordan, he went out on the top of his considerable
game.
</P>
<P>
   But White, who changed his mind 48 hours after announcing his
retirement last April, gave Green Bay Packers fans another glimmer
of hope Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On the Fox network show before the Super Bowl, White, who was
due to make $3.9 million in 1999, said he was ``intrigued'' about
the idea of returning to play under new coach Ray Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Ray got the job, if anyone else had gotten the job I
wouldn't have been intrigued,'' White told Fox. ``I've really been
praying about it and thinking about it. Right now I'm retired.''
</P>
<P>
   White's agent, Jimmy Sexton, said he doesn't think White will
change his mind.

LAEMMLE TO OPEN REGION'S BIGGEST MEGAPLEX FOR ART FILMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Laemmle Theaters, hoping to cash in on the
increased taste for offbeat fare from American moviegoers, has
stepped up its pursuit of box-office dollars by launching the
region's largest art-house theater.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of the Playhouse 7 means Laemmle, often the first
chain to show quirky films like ``Affliction'' and ``Central
Station,'' will be battling on similar megaplex turf as chains like
AMC, Edwards and Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the 1,200-seat facility is half the size of many
megaplexes, it offers the hot concepts _ stadium seating, massive
concession stands, big screens even in small auditoriums, staggered
start times _ now expected by customers at the mainstream chains.
</P>
<P>
   The mission-style complex, due to open Friday, has been under
consideration by privately-held Laemmle for most of the decade as
the competition for moviegoers heated up. ``The economics of the
business are such that single screens are disappearing,'' said
owner Robert Laemmle. ``The same conditions apply to the
specialized film area.''
</P>
<P>
   Laemmle did not disclose how much the Playhouse 7 costs but
state-of-the-art movie houses currently cost about $1 million per
screen.
</P>
<P>
   The Laemmle name goes back more than eight decades in Hollywood
history from when film distributor Carl Laemmle bought a 230-acre
ranch in the Cahuenga Pass that became Universal Studios. The
family cut ties with the studio in 1936 and started opening its own
theaters, coming to the San Fernando Valley Valley in 1979 when it
took over the Town Center complex in suburban Encino.
</P>
<P>
   The Playhouse 7 will boost the number of screens operated by Los
Angeles-based Laemmle by 20 percent from 27 to 34. It gives the
chain a far better chance of making money from obscure films like
``Clerks'' or ``Ulee's Gold'' that might have otherwise gone
unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty years ago, foreign films were a big staple of the
art-house market so it's primarily expanded from American indie
films achieving greater popularity,'' Laemmle said, citing the
near-sweep of Academy Awards by ``The English Patient,'' ``Fargo,''
``Sling Blade'' and ``Shine'' in 1997. ``The popularity of the
indies has taken on a whole new dimension.''
</P>
<P>
   Visibility for indie product, produced outside the direct
control of the seven major studios, is crucial nowadays. That's
because the number of independent movies, inspired by the break-out
successes of ``Pulp Fiction'' and ``The Full Monty,'' has exploded.
While majors have cut back the number of films released in recent
years, indies have gone from 121 movies in 1993 to 287 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The art-house market is the largest and most well-established
niche in moviegoing,'' said Chris Lanier, head of the Motion
Picture Intelligencer analysis firm. ``It is playing to a different
audience universe than a mass entertainment film, so you can do
different things because that's what that audience responds to.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimate art houses take in about 5 percent of the
nation's gross but the number of art-house screens has not expanded
as quickly as the rest of the business. ACNielsen EDI estimates
that more than half of the 3,086 U.S. screens that opened last year
came from just 80 megaplexes.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of new art-house screens and the plethora of indie
product means that distributors often can't find specialized
locations and have to settle for megaplexes or discount houses. In
either case, the grosses won't be as high as they would at an art
house.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles-based Laemmle, which operates nine theaters, is
gambling on being able to invigorate a relatively quiet stretch of
Colorado Boulevard about a mile to the east of the red-hot Old Town
retail district of Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   Experts contend it's become crucial to cluster like this. ``I
think the public is getting used to the idea that if they go see a
movie, they'll be other opportunities before and after to do things
like eating and shopping,'' said Grubb &AMP; Ellis commercial real
estate broker Bill Boyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``The introduction of live theater or additional movie screens
extends the hours of a retail environment, which enhances retail
sales,'' he added. ``They're joined at the hip because they enhance
the longevity of the customer staying in the area.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the first new theater for Laemmle since 1993, when it
opened the 1,000-seat Sunset 5 in West Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Playhouse 7's opening may lead to Laemmle
closing its other two theaters in Pasadena, the Colorado and the
Esquire. ``We've been frustrated with operating two single screens
in Pasadena that we could not show all the product we wanted,''
said Laemmle, who would only say he plans to keep the other venues
open for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   The executive argues that the line between art-house movies and
major studio releases has gotten blurry in recent years as the Big
Seven become more inclined to search for low-budget high-prestige
hits rather than farming them out to their indie subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Laemmle is pleased that the Playhouse 7 will show ``Rushmore,''
a critical favorite moving into nationwide release, on two screens
at the Playhouse 7 even though it is being released by Disney, one
of Hollywood's largest studios. ``I think of it as a well-done
specialty film even though it's from Disney and stars Bill
Murray,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also playing will be five other films with some chance of
recognition when Academy Award nominations are announced Feb. 9:
``Affliction,'' ``The General,'' ``Little Voice,'' ``Playing by
Heart'' and ``Still Crazy.''

SHAMAN SAYS IT IS LEAVING DRUG BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shaman Pharmaceuticals Inc., a biotechnology
company that relied on tribal healers to provide leads for new
drugs, said Monday it would cease its pharmaceutical operations and
lay off 60 people, or 65 percent of its work force.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came on the day that shareholders, at a special
meeting, authorized 1.5 million new stock options for Lisa A.
Conte, Shaman's president and chief executive. Ms. Conte said the
shareholders meeting, at which the reorganization suddenly became
the main topic, had been scheduled weeks earlier, when Shaman's
prospects looked brighter.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Conte said the company decided to cease drug development
after the Food and Drug Administration told Shaman that it would
require long additional clinical trials before approving the
company's first drug, to treat diarrhea in AIDS patients. She said
the company had thought, based on previous discussions with the
agency, that it had already completed sufficient testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were quite taken by surprise,'' Ms. Conte, who founded
Shaman 10 years ago, said in an interview. ``I almost use the word
ambush.'' She added, ``Our whole premise to create return for our
shareholders was shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in South San Francisco, Calif., will now try
to enter the herbal diet supplement business, which is growing
rapidly and is far less heavily regulated.
</P>
<P>
   Shaman said it would move assets and operations into the
privately held Shaman Botanicals, a subsidiary that might be spun
off someday. The company said it would try to license or sell the
drugs it had in development to other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Shaman's stock lost more than half its value Monday, falling
46.875 cents, to 40.625 cents, far below its 52-week high of nearly
$5.50.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Conte, 39, defended her stock options, saying the board had
decided on them as necessary to provide incentives for executives.
The options, which she can exercise staring in March, have an
exercise price of $1.281 a share, meaning that they will be
worthless unless Shaman's shares climb above that level.
</P>
<P>
   Shaman is just one of many biotechnology companies that have
virtually collapsed after their first products hit setbacks. It is
also one of many that are running out of money and unable to raise
new capital because of depressed stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   But Shaman attracted more attention than most because of its
strategy of consulting healers in the tropics, looking for plants
that have traditionally been used as medicines and isolating the
key ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Its first drug, isolated from a South American plant, was being
tested for use in other types of diarrhea in addition to the type
connected with AIDS. The company was also developing drugs for
diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Jim McCamant, editor of the Medical Technology Stock Letter,
said he was surprised and puzzled by the company's decision to end
its pharmaceutical program. ``They had taken it to the point where
it had significant value,'' said McCamant, who had been
recommending the stock.

KIDS GET GUIDED TOUR OF GREED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The guy from the county and the guy from the Arizona
Diamondbacks tell me that ripping off schoolchildren is not what
they had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, that's what they're doing.
</P>
<P>
   The guy from the county and the guy from the Arizona
Diamondbacks tell me that we're not talking about a lot of money,
particularly when you look at the big picture.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, they continue putting the squeeze on kids.
</P>
<P>
   The guy from the county and the guy from the Arizona
Diamondbacks tell me that everything associated with Bank One
Ballpark is new and constantly being re-evaluated and that the
program being discussed could change.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, it hasn't. Not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Later this week, a group of schoolchildren from Phoenix will
take a guided tour of Bank One Ballpark. It's part of an all-day
program in which the kids also will visit the Phoenix Public
Library.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of one of the children, Kathy Errigo, was surprised
to discover the ballpark tour would cost each student $4.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 60 children from my daughter's school going on the
tour,'' Errigo said. ``That's $240 to take kids around a ballpark
that myself and my husband and everybody else who lives here
chipped in a lot of money to build.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-hundred and thirty-eight million, to be exact.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now they want to charge children to see the place?''
Errigo said. ``That doesn't make any sense. Taxpayers paid to build
the library, too. They're not charging the kids for THAT tour.'' &QL; 
AN ARRANGEMENT
</P>
<P>
   Bill Scalzo, a spokesman for Maricopa County, said the ballpark
tours were part of an arrangement worked out with the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intention was never to make money off kids,'' he said.
``It's really something aimed more at winter visitors and tourists,
those who didn't pay taxes to build it.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is fine.
</P>
<P>
   So why charge schoolchildren?
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks spokesman Craig Pletenik emphasized that the
proceeds from ballpark tours are split between the county and
Diamondbacks charities. He said ticket pricing is based on what is
charged at other ballparks with tours.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get right down to it,'' he said, ``the proceeds are
going to charity, so in an indirect way it's going back to help
some of those same kids who have been through.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, when you get right down to it, they could treat kids
like future patrons who might think more fondly of an operation
that didn't once covet their milk money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem smart to me,'' Kathy Errigo said. ``I don't
believe the money is worth the bad feelings.'' &QL; 
`VERY FEW' COMPLAINTS
</P>
<P>
   Scalzo said the price of tours hasn't created any ill will,
however.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had very few, if any, calls with that type of
complaint,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets are $6 for adults, $4 for children ages 7 to 12, $2 for
those 4 to 6 and free for those 3 and younger. There's also a group
rate of $4 a head.
</P>
<P>
   Both Scalzo and Pletenik said money needs to be raised to pay
for guides and scheduling. Although I'd guess there are hundreds of
retired baseball fans in the area who'd do it for no pay.
</P>
<P>
   Pletenik said Diamondbacks charities handed out almost a
half-million dollars to programs for the homeless and health care
for the poor. Tour proceeds played a tiny part in that, he added.
</P>
<P>
   He and Scalzo also said the Diamondbacks and the county are
working on programs to get more kids to ballgames _ free _ in the
coming season, and that there may be more ``open house''
opportunities for the general public.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the paid tours remain popular. They last a little over
an hour, and include stops at the visitors' clubhouse, the
Diamondbacks' dugout, the swimming pool behind the center-field
fence and even a luxury suite.
</P>
<P>
   It's a very educational experience for boys and girls, teaching
them nothing about baseball but all they need to know about
government and big business.

   NEW YORK _ ``There's no bigger fan than the mayor himself,''
Michael Hess, the city's corporation counsel, declared last week
after federal prosecutors accused New York City and the New York
Yankees of discriminating against fans with disabilities at Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Let the record show that the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan
_ who signed the papers the government filed in U.S. District Court
_ is a Yankee fan too.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District, is a
fan from childhood and knows her way around Yankee Stadium. ``My
husband has been in a ticket group for about 10 years and has
tickets to about 20 home games a year,'' she said through a
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   So how many Yankees games does Mayor Rudolph Giuliani attend?
</P>
<P>
   ``As many as he can get to,'' said a spokeswoman, Colleen Roche.
She said Giuliani sits in a box on the first base side, right next
to the Yankees' dugout. Ms. White's spokesman, Herbert Hadad, would
not elaborate on where her seats are.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Shira Scheindlin, who has scheduled a hearing for a week
from Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, is maintaining
absolute impartiality. An aide said Monday that she had no comment
as to whether she was a Yankees fan or not. Maybe the Mets?
</P>
<P>
   Air Time
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, the Yankees manager, has said that winning the 1996
World Series was like having an out-of-body experience.
</P>
<P>
   He had the same feeling Monday, when he rode in (and briefly
piloted) an F-18 Hornet at the Naval Air station in El Centro,
Calif. The jet is standard equipment for the Blue Angels team that
performs internationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a rush,'' Torre said once he was back on the ground,
talking about ``the whole G-force thing'' and about taking a fast,
low pass over the California landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like going over another planet,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, Lt. Keith Hoskins, turned the controls over to Torre
at 10,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did great,'' Hoskins said. ``He did some right-handed turns
and left-handed turns, and a 360-degree roll. He did it perfect,
and we told him we were going to have to get him a job during the
off-season.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Torre put it: ``My wife said this is the most I've smiled
in the off-season, even after winning the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   A Few Bars
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ First Michael Amante, a graphic artist and cabaret
performer, wrote a song about Mary Kay Letourneau, the Seattle
teacher who had two children by a boy she started having sex with
when he was in her sixth-grade class.
</P>
<P>
   Then Amante sang the song (``I Never Meant to Fall in Love With
You'') for her over the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   She was in prison. Amante, who is scheduled to appear in the Oak
Room at the Algonquin Hotel in New York next month, was standing in
the office of Sonny Grosso, a former New York City detective turned
producer whose show business career grew out of the ``French
Connection'' drug case (Roy Scheider played Grosso in the Academy
Award-winning thriller). Grosso bought the film rights to Ms.
Letourneau's story and commissioned a script.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Letourneau was tinkering with the song's lyrics by long
distance ``like they were schoolwork'' when Amante walked in. ``I

   NEW YORK _ Bernadette Peters, who plays the pistol-packin' Annie
Oakley in the revived, rewritten version of ``Annie Get Your Gun''
that goes into previews at the Marquis Theater Tuesday night, will
not be packing real pistols. The bang-bang _ the sharp report of a
six-shooter or the crack of a rifle _ comes from the drum section.
</P>
<P>
   This is not because Miss Peters wanted ``Annie Get Your Gun'' to
make a statement about gun control. ``She has no stance on gun
control,'' her spokeswoman, Judy Katz, said.
</P>
<P>
   No, the decision came from the show's choreographer, Graciela
Daniele. ``I hate firearms,'' she said. ``They were absolutely
needed 200 years ago when people had to kill to eat, but not
today.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the issue of authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did research on Annie Oakley,'' she said. ``They never used
bullets. They used pellets, or they would have killed the
spectators.''

KIDS GET GUIDED TOUR OF GREED 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX _ The guy from the county and the guy from the Arizona
Diamondbacks tell me that ripping off schoolchildren is not what
they had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, that's what they're doing.
</P>
<P>
   The guy from the county and the guy from the Arizona
Diamondbacks tell me that we're not talking about a lot of money,
particularly when you look at the big picture.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, they continue putting the squeeze on kids.
</P>
<P>
   The guy from the county and the guy from the Arizona
Diamondbacks tell me that everything associated with Bank One
Ballpark is new and constantly being re-evaluated and that the
program being discussed could change.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, it hasn't. Not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Later this week, a group of schoolchildren from Phoenix will
take a guided tour of Bank One Ballpark. It's part of an all-day
program in which the kids also will visit the Phoenix Public
Library.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of one of the children, Kathy Errigo, was surprised
to discover the ballpark tour would cost each student $4.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 60 children from my daughter's school going on the
tour,'' Errigo said. ``That's $240 to take kids around a ballpark
that myself and my husband and everybody else who lives here
chipped in a lot of money to build.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-hundred and thirty-eight million, to be exact.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now they want to charge children to see the place?''
Errigo said. ``That doesn't make any sense. Taxpayers paid to build
the library, too. They're not charging the kids for THAT tour.'' &QL; 
AN ARRANGEMENT
</P>
<P>
   Bill Scalzo, a spokesman for Maricopa County, said the ballpark
tours were part of an arrangement worked out with the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intention was never to make money off kids,'' he said.
``It's really something aimed more at winter visitors and tourists,
those who didn't pay taxes to build it.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is fine.
</P>
<P>
   So why charge schoolchildren?
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks spokesman Craig Pletenik emphasized that the
proceeds from ballpark tours are split between the county and
Diamondbacks charities. He said ticket pricing is based on what is
charged at other ballparks with tours.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get right down to it,'' he said, ``the proceeds are
going to charity, so in an indirect way it's going back to help
some of those same kids who have been through.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, when you get right down to it, they could treat kids
like future patrons who might think more fondly of an operation
that didn't once covet their milk money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem smart to me,'' Kathy Errigo said. ``I don't
believe the money is worth the bad feelings.'' &QL; 
`VERY FEW' COMPLAINTS
</P>
<P>
   Scalzo said the price of tours hasn't created any ill will,
however.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had very few, if any, calls with that type of
complaint,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets are $6 for adults, $4 for children ages 7 to 12, $2 for
those 4 to 6 and free for those 3 and younger. There's also a group
rate of $4 a head.
</P>
<P>
   Both Scalzo and Pletenik said money needs to be raised to pay
for guides and scheduling. Although I'd guess there are hundreds of
retired baseball fans in the area who'd do it for no pay.
</P>
<P>
   Pletenik said Diamondbacks charities handed out almost a
half-million dollars to programs for the homeless and health care
for the poor. Tour proceeds played a tiny part in that, he added.
</P>
<P>
   He and Scalzo also said the Diamondbacks and the county are
working on programs to get more kids to ballgames _ free _ in the
coming season, and that there may be more ``open house''
opportunities for the general public.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the paid tours remain popular. They last a little over
an hour, and include stops at the visitors' clubhouse, the
Diamondbacks' dugout, the swimming pool behind the center-field
fence and even a luxury suite.
</P>
<P>
   It's a very educational experience for boys and girls, teaching
them nothing about baseball but all they need to know about
government and big business.

FREEZE ON MEDICARE MONEY TO HOSPITALS WOULD PAY FOR HEALTH CARE
INITIATIVES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, Fla.)   (See related BUDGET-CLINTON, BUDGET-ASSESS, BUDGET-REVENUE) 
 (Eds: SUBS for story slugged BUDGET-SPEND on digest; accompanied by

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the budget blueprint he offered Monday,
President Clinton proposes keeping Medicare payments to hospitals
at current levels next year to help pay for new health care
initiatives, including assistance to people who need long-term care
and the expansion of Medicare to people from 55 to 64.
</P>
<P>
   The freeze, which would save $3.9 billion over five years, comes
on top of cutbacks made by Congress in the Balanced Budget Act of
1997, which squeezed $112 billion from Medicare over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, administrator of the federal Health Care
Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, said the proposed
freeze in hospital payment rates was justified because hospitals
were being overpaid.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Pollack, executive vice president of the American
Hospital Association, said: ``We don't understand the logic behind
the president's proposal. It makes no sense to us.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should wait to see how hospitals and other health care
providers cope with the cuts already enacted'' in 1997, Schumer
said in a letter to the president. Moreover, he said, the proposed
cutbacks would ``fall heavily on New York hospitals'' and, because
the savings would be used to finance new initiatives, would not
improve the shaky financial condition of the Medicare trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposes a relatively modest increase in the budget of
the National Institutes of Health, the pre-eminent sponsor of
biomedical research in the United States. In 1998, Congress
approved an increase of $2 billion, or 15 percent, so the
institutes would have a total of $15.6 billion in the current
fiscal year. Clinton proposes a further increase of $320 million,
or 2.1 percent, for a total of $15.9 billion in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Even Donna Shalala, the secretary of Health and Human Services,
said such abrupt changes in the growth of federal support for
scientific research were unwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would prefer that it was larger,'' Shalala said. ``I don't
think that the roller-coaster effect, going up and going down, is
an effective way to invest in the nation's scientific
infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his proposal was consistent with his commitment,
made before the 1999 budget was adopted last year, to increase the
NIH budget by 50 percent over five years. In contrast, members of
Congress from both parties are determined to double the institutes'
budget over five years, and administration officials said Clinton
could propose small increases in the knowledge that Congress would
add to them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sens. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and Connie Mack, R-Fla., said
they were disappointed with the president's proposal for biomedical
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``This represents a regrettable retreat in the search for
medical breakthroughs,'' Harkin said. Mack said: ``The president's
proposed budget means a cease-fire in the war against cancer,
Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and other diseases. It is unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton proposed a big increase for the Food and Drug
Administration. Its budget would rise by 19 percent, to $1.35
billion. Shalala said this would be the biggest increase for the
agency in two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The president would double the budget for FDA enforcement of
tobacco rules, providing $68 million to curb cigarette sales to
people under the age of 18.

FRANK RICH GETTING DUAL ROLE AT THE NEW YORK TIMES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Frank Rich, whose column has appeared on The New York
Times' Op-Ed page twice a week since January 1994, will write
longer articles for the page and become a regular contributor to
The Times Magazine. This arrangement was announced on Monday by
Arthur Sulzberger Jr., publisher of the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Times editors said the new arrangement was a response to Rich's
desire to write essays and articles lengthier than the 700-word
Op-Ed format would permit. Starting in June, he will write a
1,400-word opinion article for the Op-Ed page every other Saturday.
He will also write articles and commentaries for the magazine on a
variety of subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lelyveld, the executive editor, said Rich would
``continue to be a major cultural critic in every possible sense.''
Rich joined The Times in 1980 and served as its chief theater
critic for 13 years before becoming a columnist.
</P>
<P>
   Journal, Rich's 700-word column, will appear until Feb. 13. He
will then take a four-month leave to finish a memoir for Random
House and will return in June.

STARR SAYS HE WILL INVESTIGATE HIS OFFICE FOR LEAKS 
</HEADLINE>

 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, said Monday
that he would investigate his own office for leaks, after President
Clinton's lawyer accused it of disclosing that Starr might seek an
indictment of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In making his accusation Monday morning, David Kendall, the
president's private lawyer, cited an account in The New York Times
on Sunday, attributed to associates of Starr, that said he had
concluded he had the authority to seek the indictment of an
incumbent president. White House aides complained that Starr was
spreading that news in hopes of influencing the Senate impeachment
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bakaly, a spokesman for Starr, denied that his office
was the source for the article.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not leak this information, and that's all I can say
about that,'' Bakaly said on the ABC News television program ``Good
Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   For almost a year, Kendall has accused Starr of violating
federal rules forbidding the disclosure of grand jury testimony.
Starr has repeatedly denied such disclosure, and critics of the
White House have accused it of spreading protected information
itself, in hopes of tarring the prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall said on Monday that he would file a motion in federal
court over the latest episode, seeking to have Starr and his staff
held in contempt for ``improper violations of grand jury secrecy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The office of independent counsel,'' Kendall said, ``has once
again engaged in illegal and partisan leaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Late on Monday afternoon, Starr issued a statement that said:
``We are deeply troubled by yesterday's New York Times report. This
office has no desire to inject itself into the constitutional
process under way in the Senate. We are launching an internal
investigation to determine whether anyone in this office improperly
disclosed the information to The Times. The announcement of this
investigation should not be taken as confirmation of anything in
the article.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam Clymer, Washington editor of The Times, said, ``We do not
discuss our sources.''
</P>
<P>
   James Kennedy, a White House spokesman, noted that Starr
announced another internal leaks investigation last Feb. 6.
``Here's hoping this February's investigation doesn't disappear
into the same black hole as last February's investigation,''
Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   In making his accusation, Kendall is relying on a broad
interpretation of the rules governing grand jury secrecy. But the
federal judge who has heard his previous complaints, Norma Holloway
Johnson, has upheld a broad interpretation in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall believes that prosecutors are forbidden to reveal not
only the content of grand jury testimony but also subjects of
potential indictments and the timing of indictments, Clinton
advisers said.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Judge Johnson ruled that prosecutors were
prohibited from talking publicly about matters like the ``strategy
and direction of the investigation'' as well as ``what is likely to
occur'' before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   She found that 24 news accounts last year appeared on their face
to show that prosecutors from Starr's office had violated federal
rules by disclosing details of their investigation of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The judge appointed a special master, John Kern III, a former
judge here, to investigate the matter. His progress is unclear,
though he was expected to report to Judge Johnson by the end of
1998.

CLINTON PROPOSES LARGEST INCREASE IN MILITARY SPENDING SINCE
REAGAN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz.)   (See related BUDGET-CLINTON, BUDGET-ASSESS, BUDGET-REVENUE) 
 (Eds: SUBS for story slugged BUDGET-SPEND on digest; accompanied by
BUDGET-HEALTH, BUDGET-ENERGY and BUDGET-ENVIRONMENT.)  (mk) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The budget proposed by President Clinton on Monday
includes the largest increase in military spending since the Cold
War buildup under President Reagan and would give members of the
military their biggest raise in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The president's budget of $267.2 billion includes a $12 billion
increase, $4 billion of which is a straight increase and $8 billion
of which is to be financed by savings earned from
lower-than-budgeted fuel prices and inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The president is also asking for the authority to initiate two
more rounds of base closings, which would eventually produce $2
billion in annual savings, although that is not reflected in this
year's budget.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton appears to have included all the money requested
by the military to improve pay, benefits and readiness _ including
spare parts and training _ he held back on any sharp increase for
modernizing the military's weaponry and equipment. He asked for $53
billion for procurements, only $1 billion less than in the earlier
budget review. But it was not the larger increase requested by the
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   That modernization includes money for a new Virginia-class
attack submarine, Navy ships, aircraft for the Air Force and a
national missile defense system that the Pentagon is trying to
develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``This highlights the looming debate over modernization that
will probably become part of next year's presidential campaign,''
said Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution. ``The question
will be whether the Cold War-like agenda for modernization should
be reassessed before all that money is spent.``
</P>
<P>
   In presenting the budget, Defense Secretary William Cohen
emphasized the 4.4 percent increase in pay for the troops, the
reinstatement of military retirement benefits to 50 percent of base
pay after 20 years in service, from 40 percent, as well as special
programs to encourage members of the military to stay in the
service.
</P>
<P>
   Congress agrees that the military deserves higher pay and, in
what may become a bidding war, a Senate committee last week
approved a bill that would give the military an even larger raise,
4.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said Monday that while the Pentagon welcomed as much money
as it could get ``for our men and women in uniform,'' he was
worried that the Senate would not be able to come up with the
additional $7 billion that its pay proposal would require.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want to raise expectations and not be able to pay
for it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, Senate Republicans, who plan to make increasing
military pay a major theme of this congressional session,
complained that the Clinton budget for the military was not large
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am disappointed that the president did not fully heed the
requests of his secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff
for a significant defense budget increase,'' said Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   The military budget is apart from $13 billion for the nuclear
weapons programs of the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   About $29 billion of the Pentagon's budget is for the nation's
13 intelligence services, including the CIA. The precise amount is
classified.

   The New York Times says in an editorial Tuesday, Feb. 2: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Was Sunday's Super Bowl John Elway's last game? He has talked
about retiring, but has made no final decision. Denver obviously
needs him next year if it hopes to become the first team in history
to win a third straight Super Bowl. The game of professional
football may need him even more to revive sagging ratings.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, it is best for an athlete to leave at the top of his
game, before the reflexes erode and the muscles tire and the fans
grow fickle. Elway is clearly at the top, but if Sunday's
performance is any guide, he has at least one and maybe several
more years of excellence left in him. His arm is the same cannon it
always was, his competitiveness is undiminished. Near the end of a
game that Denver was in no danger of losing, he even chewed out a
receiver who had run the wrong pattern, possibly costing Denver a
final touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   It may be tempting to take his most-valuable-player trophy and
his 38-year-old body and retire to his den and the golf course. But
his teammates hope this second straight Super Bowl victory may spur
him to go for three _ a tasty prospect that, Elway concedes,
``throws a kink into my thinking.'' The people who run the National
Football League have an equal interest in his continued presence.
Attendance has been flat during the 1990s, while television ratings
have actually declined.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend, with some justification, that professional
football has become boring, with excessive timeouts and too many
coaches who prefer conservative running games to razzle-dazzle.
Students of the game also lament that free agency has made it
impossible to build and maintain the kind of marquee teams, like
the old Dallas Cowboys or San Francisco 49ers, that some people
love and others love to hate but nearly everyone wants to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Elway can help fix all that. There is nothing conservative about
a quarterback who has produced a record 47 game-saving drives over
his career. This man was born to take risks. And with Elway at the
helm, Denver surely has marquee status. Elway may feel that 16 hard
years is enough. But he should consider at least one more.

EDITORIAL: KEN STARR'S MEDDLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Tuesday, Feb. 2: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising aspect of the Senate impeachment trial is
the persistent challenges to the senators' constitutional right to
run it. First came the House managers' attempt to call a parade of
unnecessary witnesses. Now we have an apparent effort from the
office of Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, to spark a debate
over criminal prosecution of the president at a time when the
Senate deserves a calm decision-making atmosphere and an open field
for negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is already regarded by his critics as an obsessive
personality. Now he seems determined to write himself into the
history books as a narcissistic legal crank. Once the Senate
started the second presidential impeachment trial in American
history, that was Starr's cue not only to shut up but to stop any
activity by his office that would direct attention away from the
Senate or reduce its bargaining room. The issue of who leaked news
of Starr's indictment research to The New York Times is a phony
one. What is needed here is not an investigation of journalistic
sources, but attention to the substance of Starr's legal mischief.
It seems designed to disrupt these solemn deliberations into
presidential misconduct of a serious if undeniably sordid kind.
</P>
<P>
   The news article highlighted an underlying problem. Starr keeps
flapping around _ with deliberations over indictments and by
meddling in the House managers' contacts with Monica Lewinsky _ in
ways that complicate Senate work that is more important than he is.
The Senate should rebuke Starr and also appeal to the federal
judges who supervise him to restrain him from further disturbance
of the constitutional process.
</P>
<P>
   This incident is more serious than Starr's customary blundering.
The Constitution clearly allows the indictment and prosecution of
officials who have been impeached by the House and removed from
office by the Senate. But whether such a trial should go forward in
this case is a complex constitutional and civic question that needs
to be shaped by the wisdom of the Senate rather than by Starr's
personal inclinations and his idea of prosecutorial duty. If the
three witnesses being deposed this week do not dramatically change
the evidence, then the Senate is clearly the right place to make
the final disposition of President Clinton's case.
</P>
<P>
   For Starr's office to be talking about a trial inhibits the
Senate's freedom to draft a censure resolution that might include
some kind of presidential admission. Indeed, virtually everyone in
the capital except Starr seems to know that censure-plus-admission,
speedily arrived at, would be a far better outcome for the country
than a trial for either a sitting or former president.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, if the charges were of greater criminal magnitude or
threatened orderly government, such a trial could be fitting and
constitutional once a president was removed. While removal is not
appropriate in this case, the Senate is clearly the appropriate
venue for condemning and finding a proportional punishment to
offenses like those committed by Clinton. The Senate, which is
always talking about its potent collective probity, needs to find a
way to slap Starr back into line.

   WASHINGTON _ Under President Clinton's proposed budget, the
Energy Department's operating budget for the 2000 fiscal year would
rise $717 million, or 4.1 percent above the 1999 figure, not
counting one-time expenditures this year like buying enriched
uranium from Russia and helping that country safeguard plutonium.
Spending in 2000 would be $17.8 billion, about the same as what the
department is spending this year, including those one-time
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   The administration wants to spend $208 million more on renewable
energy and energy efficiency, and $138 million for science
projects, including supercomputers and a new nuclear laboratory at
Oak Ridge, Tenn., that would use neutrons to investigate the
properties of matter. The proposal also includes $109 million for
``threats of nuclear, biological and chemical proliferation,'' and
for doubling the counterintelligence effort, because of penetration
of the department's laboratories by foreign spies.
</P>
<P>
   Other areas that would get big increases include a testing
program for nuclear weapons that substitutes for explosions, and
environmental clean-up of former weapons sites.
</P>
<P>
   The budget also proposes to pay for maintenance of the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve out of tax revenues, rather than sales from the
reserve, and Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said he would soon
propose some way to add oil. He said this would not be a
``budgetary initiative'' but did not say how he planned to pay for
increasing the reserve, which is at 561 million barrels, roughly
two months' worth of imports.
</P>
<P>
   The budget also calls for $86.5 million, up from $78.5 million,
for health studies of workers and people who live near weapons
plants. The department is trying to determine, with the Department
of Health and Human Services, which sites most merit study.

WHITE HOUSE SEEKING RECORD $34 BILLION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The administration is seeking a record $33.9
billion for environmental programs next year, an increase of 5
percent over this year's spending.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the hardest part of the budget to sell in Congress will
be the $4 billion for fighting the risk of global warming, mainly
by spurring research and investments in energy efficiency. But even
industry lobbyists who have opposed a proposed international treaty
to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases welcomed some of the
proposals, saying they would help companies take voluntary steps.
</P>
<P>
   Along with hefty increases in federal energy research, the
budget for 2000 proposed by President Clinton on Monday seeks $3.6
billion in tax breaks over the next five years for renewable energy
investments and for purchases of energy-efficient homes, cars and
appliances. Congress has turned down similar ideas before.
</P>
<P>
   Another major initiative calls for spending $1 billion next year
to buy land for conservation, a record amount. Like several other
environmental proposals, this one had already been announced by the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights include $312 million for restoring the
Everglades, $2.3 billion for programs to clean up polluted waters,
$1.5 billion for cleaning up Superfund toxic waste dumps, and $1.8
billion for transportation programs intended to ease traffic
congestion to help cut air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental proposals emphasize aid to states and cities,
including matching grants for air pollution programs and $700
million in tax credits over five years to subsidize the issuance of
$9.5 billion in conservation bonds. Of the Environmental Protection
Agency's request for $7.2 billion next year, 40 percent would be
funneled to state and local governments, officials said.

PRESIDENT TO OUTLINE EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES AND BETH DALEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton arrives in Boston Tuesday,
he will be pushing a plan to improve public education so steeped in
traditional Republican philosophy that it might have been
considered political suicide for a Democratic president to offer
only a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   But with Democratic states like Massachusetts in the vanguard of
embracing ideas that the president has adopted, such as testing
teachers and ending social promotions, Clinton has seized on a way
to answer a public clamor for better schools.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, he will visit the 716-student Jackson-Mann Elementary
School in Allston's Union Square to tout a $200 million initiative
in his proposed budget to identify and turn around low-performing
schools.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by Congress, the funds would go directly to school
districts and states to help them target the worst schools and send
in special teams to determine problems and how to fix them.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative is a follow-up to Clinton's warning to states and
school districts during last month's State of the Union address to
``turn around their worst-performing schools, or shut them down.''
</P>
<P>
   The money would be part of a much broader effort aimed at
increasing the accountability of school districts under this year's
reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants to require new teachers to pass performance exams
and have credentials to teach in their given subject area and to
require school districts to issue report cards on every school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can look at what we are proposing and say
that's a conservative agenda,'' Bruce Reed, Clinton's domestic
policy adviser, said in an interview Monday. ``These ideas aren't
conservative or liberal. They're just plain common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   But educators and political scientists said the prescriptions
Clinton offers for improving schools are conservative. They said
many of the ideas once were considered the province of Republican
governors and a handful of Southern Democratic governors, including
Clinton, who broke with his party's liberal wing while governor of
Arkansas to embrace testing teachers and incurred the wrath of the
state's teachers union.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a Democratic president, this would have been unthinkable
10, 15 years ago,'' said Tom Loveless, associate professor of
public policy at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of
Government.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are Republican ideas,'' said Mark Rozell, a political
scientist with the University of Pennsylvania. ``These are ideas
that largely grew out of the socially conservative base of the
Republican Party, which is the ultimate irony.''
</P>
<P>
   Rozell said Clinton's ideas on school accountability dovetail
with his 1996 reelection campaign, when Clinton gained the
advantage over Republicans by adopting the debate over values in
education and focusing on national standards, school discipline,
school choice and mandatory school uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, which supports Clinton's education proposals, said after
years of frustration about poor-performing schools, Democrats are
looking for new remedies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more of a consensus now than there has been over the
past decade,'' Feldman said. ``There was not a consensus before on
the direction we should take on education. Now we know more than we
did a decade or two ago, and we have seen children achieve better
when those elements are put in place.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton clearly does not want to alienate teachers' unions,
a huge presence at recent Democratic Party conventions. His
proposal, for example, steers clear of endorsing school vouchers,
which Democrats and the unions oppose. He also did not call for
testing current teachers, only new ones. And his proposal also
centers more power in Washington, which has led some Republicans to
label him ``superintendent in chief.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The center line in the country has shifted. There's no
question about that,'' Representative James E. Clyburn, the
chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said about Clinton's
education proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Clyburn, a Democrat from South Carolina who taught world history
in high school, said: ``I don't have any problems in theory with
what the president is proposing. Now when we come up to passing
legislation . . . that's where we are going to have the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton arrives Tuesday, he will find that Massachusetts
communities, and Boston in particular, have already embraced many
of his initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Boston pledged to end social promotions by instituting new
promotion and attendance policies this year that require students
to pass courses and tests and miss no more than 12 days of school a
year. More than 20 percent of high school students are already at
risk of being held back this year for attendance.
</P>
<P>
   The city has also embarked on a massive effort to create
after-school programs linked to students' school work.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson-Mann School is one of six elementary schools in the city
that scored better than expected on tough new state tests last
spring _ a sign, educators said, that higher standards set on the
state level are trickling into classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Jackson-Mann school population is poor, often
synonymous with low tests scores. But some 75 percent of its
students scored in the ``basic knowledge'' or above categories on
the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System test last spring,
and did better than similar schools.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 fourth- and fifth-grade students in the school choir
will sing before Tuesday's event. Grade 2 teacher Gail Zimmerman
will talk about the school's literacy efforts. After Clinton
speaks, he will meet privately with chorus members and other
students.
</P>
<P>
   The school, which is 43 percent black, 28 percent Asian, 16
percent Hispanic and 13 percent white, has reallocated federal
money to ensure small class sizes of no more than 25 for Grades 1
and 2, said principal Joanne Collins Russell. Every day, the school
spends 90 minutes with students on reading.
</P>
<P>
   Russell said the school's strong ties with local colleges and
Boston Partners in Education, a volunteer group, has helped with
efforts to teach all students how to read well.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, Massachusetts has also been trying to raise
standards: New learning guidelines now spell out what each student
should learn in each grade.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, teacher tests now are administered to new teacher
candidates, and Governor Paul Cellucci filed legislation last month
to do the same for veteran teachers. Starting last year, students
began taking the MCAS exams that are tied to the new learning
standards. Beginning in two years, every student will have to pass
the 10th-grade test in order to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with some 48 percent of teacher candidates failing the
first test and an estimated 25 to 35 percent of students expected
to fail the graduation test, Massachusetts has a long way to go to
declare the new efforts a success. Statewide, 50 percent of
10th-graders failed the MCAS math test last spring.

DENIM TURNED EVERY WHICH WAY BUT LOOSE

<P>
   Blue is supposed to be the color for the millennium. Could that
be why denim seems to be more popular now than at any time in the
last 10 years? Its current appeal extends to all ages and
socioeconomic groups, to the young and to the sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   While teen-agers live in jeans, wearing them for school, on
dates, for just about every activity, adults generally reserve them
for casual times. But there are signs that designers would like to
change that. And not just designers with jeans lines like Tommy
Hilfiger, Helmut Lang, Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   In her spring-summer report to Saks Fifth Avenue's buyers,
Nicole Fischelis, the store's fashion director, listed all the
variations on denim seen on the runways. These included Martin
Margiela's recycled-denim pinafore, Chanel's simple denim skirts
paired with organza tops, Gucci's elaborately decorated jeans, Anna
Sui's hippie revival, Hussein Chalayan's denim suits with
asymmetric trimming, and Thierry Mugler's glamour dresses in denim.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the feather-trimmed denim strapless ball gown in Jean
Paul Gaultier's haute-couture show last month, and 10 pages in the
February Harper's Bazaar of denim that was studded, painted and
distressed by designers like Lang, Stephen Sprouse and Tom Ford
(whose feather-trimmed and embroidered jeans for Gucci are priced
at more than $3,000).
</P>
<P>
   Denim has come a long way since a Bavarian immigrant named Levi
Strauss first used it in 1850 to sew sturdy trousers for California
miners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it denim deluxe,'' Ms. Fischelis said. ``There are new
ways to take this fabric. I see a return of denim done in very
fashion ways. Our March catalog has a spread on different items of
denim. There are shoes, slides, hair accessories, and bags from
Chanel and Fendi.''
</P>
<P>
   Kal Ruttenstein, Bloomingdale's senior vice president for
fashion direction, also sees a revival of interest in denim as a
fashion fabric. ``That Gaultier couture dress will give a
tremendous resurgence to ready-to-wear in denim,'' he said. ``We
think it will put the idea of making things other than jeans into
more designers' heads.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that, while the darkest denim is selling now,
Bloomingdale's is betting on distressed looks and white for spring.
``And we think gray and pewter denim will be strong for fall,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Like everything else in fashion, the interest in denim and jeans
is cyclical. In the 1950s, movie stars like Marilyn Monroe and
James Dean made wearing jeans look glamorous and sexy. In the '60s,
jeans became a symbol of social rebellion. In the late '70s, Calvin
Klein and Ralph Lauren got into the act and sparked a craze for
designer jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Jeans sales reached 502 million pairs in 1981. By 1998, that
figure had dropped to 412 million. Sales last year totaled $8.29
billion, according to the NPD Group, which tracks sales of apparel
and accessories. That represents an increase of more than $2
billion in the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The jeans business appears to be growing, thanks to the
teen-agers who have adopted jeans as a school uniform. And it has
become fashion-driven. Style, fit and label are all important to
teen-agers, and the criteria can change with astonishing speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a fashion cycle, and when you're in a fashion cycle
it can shift so fast,'' said Bonnie Junell, a Nordstrom vice
president and merchandise manager for junior girls. ``Fit-and-flare
is the new basic. We used to display jeans folded on shelves on the
back wall. Now you have to hang them so they see the style.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Bufano, an executive vice president of Macy's East,
agreed. ``The status explosion has been going on for three or four
years with labels like DKNY, Polo, Tommy Jeans, Guess and CK Calvin
Klein,'' she said. ``In the junior area, the explosion has reached
the second-tier jeans resources, the California-based entrepreneurs
that have tremendous newness, that change the silhouette and body
every six weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   She mentioned labels like Mudd, LEI, Paris Blues and Union Bay
that have been keeping up with changing tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers who a few years ago were wearing oversize
rave-inspired jeans with elephant legs so wide they looked like
skirts are now into a smaller silhouette. Favored styles are either
hip-huggers that fit tight across the hips and thighs and flare out
toward the ankle or slim, straight-legged styles with turned-up
cuffs. There are, of course, regional differences.
</P>
<P>
   One of the people who track fashion preferences among teen-agers
is Irma Zandl, the president of the Zandl Group in New York, a
trend-spotting company that does nationwide surveys. She says that,
as might be expected, jeans are the single most popular item in
teen-agers' wardrobes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York, we've been seeing dark denims with a tighter fit
for the last two or three years,'' Ms. Zandl said. ``In the
Midwest, we're not seeing that. We're still seeing the bigger jeans
of Jnco, which cornered the market on Raver. But I think that's
peaked. In California, super bell-bottoms are hot. But over all,
the silhouette is smaller and cleaner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are influenced by what the cool people in school are
wearing,'' she said. ``The right clothes and the right brands have
become so important. Pity the kid who saves up to buy the brand
that's in and cool and by the time he has it, people go, `That's so
out.'''
</P>
<P>
   One of the labels that has been out with the young is old
reliable Levi's, which they consider their ``father's jeans.''
Although Levi's is still the best-selling jeans brand, its market
share dropped 30 percent between 1997 and 1998 among males 13 to 24
years old and 38 percent among girls in the same age group,
according to the Zandl Group's latest survey.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's sales fell 4 percent, to $6.9 billion, in 1997, the
latest year for which earnings have been reported. Last month,
Peter Jacobi, the company's No. 2 executive, retired as analysts
predicted an even steeper drop in sales for 1998. Levi's was ``slow
to react to the trends young people were into,'' Ms. Zandl said,
adding, ``Their challenge is getting that back.''
</P>
<P>
   Devon Burt, the creative director of the Levi's brand for the
last six months, is working to reconnect with the youth market.
``We've been around a long time,'' he said, ``and kids are always
looking for something new, something to identify their own
personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so into the classic five-pocket jean. We still own
that classic. No one can do it better. But what we want to do is
get more in the center and be able to react quicker. By no means
are we going to go out and chase trends, but we have to redefine
what we stand for and let the new generation understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the ways Levi's is reaching out to the youth market is by
sponsoring music tours and by bringing out the Mod Squad
Collection, a line of clothing inspired by the ``Mod Squad'' movie
coming out next month starring Claire Danes, Omar Epps and Giovanni
Ribisi.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's may be taking a cue from Tommy Hilfiger, who has been
successful in connecting with the youth market for all the products
he sells. To promote his 3-year-old men's jeans line and the Tommy
Jeans for the junior women's market introduced last fall, he is
using hip young musicians in print ads and is currently sponsoring
the Rolling Stones ``No Security'' tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be in touch with the customer,'' he said. ``The
young consumer today is so advanced, so on top of what's happening,
you have to feed new ideas into the pipeline. If you have a great
name and don't have the product, they won't buy. But you can have a
marginal name and a great product, and they'll find you.'' &QL;

in high school, said: ``I don't have any problems in theory with
what the president is proposing. Now when we come up to passing
legislation . . . that's where we are going to have the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton arrives Tuesday, he will find that Massachusetts
communities, and Boston in particular, have already embraced many
of his initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Boston pledged to end social promotions by instituting new
promotion and attendance policies this year that require students
to pass courses and tests and miss no more than 12 days of school a
year. More than 20 percent of high school students are already at
risk of being held back this year for attendance.
</P>
<P>
   The city has also embarked on a massive effort to create
after-school programs linked to students' school work.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson-Mann School is one of six elementary schools in the city
that scored better than expected on tough new state tests last
spring _ a sign, educators said, that higher standards set on the
state level are trickling into classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Jackson-Mann school population is poor, often
synonymous with low tests scores. But some 75 percent of its
students scored in the ``basic knowledge'' or above categories on
the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System test last spring,
and did better than similar schools.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 fourth- and fifth-grade students in the school choir
will sing before Tuesday's event. Grade 2 teacher Gail Zimmerman
will talk about the school's literacy efforts. After Clinton
speaks, he will meet privately with chorus members and other
students.
</P>
<P>
   The school, which is 43 percent black, 28 percent Asian, 16
percent Hispanic and 13 percent white, has reallocated federal
money to ensure small class sizes of no more than 25 for Grades 1
and 2, said principal Joanne Collins Russell. Every day, the school
spends 90 minutes with students on reading.
</P>
<P>
   Russell said the school's strong ties with local colleges and
Boston Partners in Education, a volunteer group, has helped with
efforts to teach all students how to read well.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, Massachusetts has also been trying to raise
standards: New learning guidelines now spell out what each student
should learn in each grade.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, teacher tests now are administered to new teacher
candidates, and Governor Paul Cellucci filed legislation last month
to do the same for veteran teachers. Starting last year, students
began taking the MCAS exams that are tied to the new learning
standards. Beginning in two years, every student will have to pass
the 10th-grade test in order to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with some 48 percent of teacher candidates failing the
first test and an estimated 25 to 35 percent of students expected
to fail the graduation test, Massachusetts has a long way to go to
declare the new efforts a success. Statewide, 50 percent of
10th-graders failed the MCAS math test last spring.

BRODEUR AND THE PENALTY KILLERS EARN A POINT FOR DEVILS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Devils were looking to redeem
themselves Monday night after their lackadaisical approach led to a
loss two days ago to Nashville, one of the lowly teams in the
league. This time they started just as well as they did against the
expansion Predators, but they maintained their intensity for the
entire game and earned a 2-2 tie against the Detroit Red Wings, one
of the league's elite teams.
</P>
<P>
   That Detroit has won the last two Stanley Cups provided more
than enough motivation for the Devils to play well and sustain it.
But the Devils will have to do better against the Nashvilles of the
league if their aim is to finish high in the conference ranking and
play one of the weaker teams in the playoffs' first round.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils earned a tie at Continental Arena thanks primarily to
the efficiency of their penalty killers. They kept the Red Wings
scoreless in five power-play attempts and they have now kept the
opposition at bay in the last 25 power plays spanning six games.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brodeur made 30 saves in the New Jersey net and was
particularly sharp during the five manpower advantages for the Red
Wings, who got goals from Aaron Ward and Slava Kozlov. Petr Sykora
and Lyle Odelein scored for the Devils, who failed on five manpower
advantages of their own, including one in the five-minute overtime.
</P>
<P>
   For Coach Robbie Ftorek of New Jersey, there were several
agonizing moments, especially in the first period, as his Devils
were caught in odd-man rushes. Were it not for Brodeur's
goaltending, Detroit would have had more than two goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils started with enthusiasm and Sykora opened the scoring
just 3 minutes 1 second into the game, when his blistering shot
from the right circle hit Chris Osgood's left post and landed in
the net. It was Sykora's 14th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Ward tied it for Detroit with his third of the season, at 8:01,
when his shot from near the Devils' blue line found its way past
Brodeur through a crowd in front of the goaltender.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit took the lead just under two minutes later when Martin
Lapointe intercepted Bobby Holik's pass in the Devils' zone. His
shot was knocked away by Brodeur, but Kozlov was there for the
rebound and his 11th goal of the season from close range on the
left.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Yzerman had a marvelous opportunity to extend the lead
with six minutes left in the period during a Devils power play.
Brian Rolston of the Devils lost the puck at Detroit's blue line
and Yzerman broke in alone on Brodeur, but his shot hit the
goalie's left skate.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils were the better team in the second period and tied
the game on Odelein's second goal in two games, his second of the
season as well. games. It came with 2:39 left in the period from
close range on the right after a precision cross-ice pass by
Brendan Morrison.

CLINTON PROPOSES 81 TAX INCREASES AND 37 CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 4th graf to insert administration figures) (See also BUDGET-CLINTON, BUDGET-ASSESS, BUDGET-SPEND) 
(lb) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's budget includes a grab bag of
small tax cuts for some Americans and small tax increases for
others. Many of these tax proposals seem unlikely to get far in the
Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen such a kitchen-sink approach to government,''
said Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, which takes first crack at tax legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans like Archer prefer an across-the-board reduction in
income-tax rates for all taxpayers, but it is far from clear that
such an approach can be enacted in the face of a likely
presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
   As tallied by congressional committee staff members, who added
all the pluses and minuses in the budget's revenue tables, Clinton
proposed 81 separate tax increases totaling $82 billion over the
next five years and 37 tax cuts totaling $36 billion over the same
period. By the administration's calculations, the comparable
figures are $87.4 billion in new revenue and $32.6 billion in tax
reductions.
</P>
<P>
   The largest amount of new revenue anticipated in the budget
would be generated by the president's tobacco policy. Clinton would
raise nearly $35 billion over five years by increasing the federal
tax on cigarettes, now 24 cents a pack, by an additional 55 cents.
And he would raise an additional $19 billion by insisting that the
federal government get a share of the money that states will
receive from their lawsuits against the cigarette manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   This revenue may not materialize. Last year, the Senate rejected
a proposed increase in cigarette taxes, and the measure never got
off the ground in the House. Furthermore, the states have resisted
sharing with Washington the proceeds from their lawsuits, and
measures are pending in Congress that would block attempts to
recoup the money.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the president's tax proposals do stand a fair chance of
enactment. For example, Clinton proposed a tax cut of up to $1,000
to defray some of the cost of long-term care for elderly or
disabled dependents. A similar proposal was part of the Contract
With America, the platform on which Republicans ran when they won
control of the House in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Clinton proposal, taxpayers could claim this credit if
they provided more than half the support of someone who was in a
nursing home or required other long-term care. The credit would be
reduced for taxpayers with incomes above $75,000, or $110,000 for a
couple filing a joint return.
</P>
<P>
   The president's proposal for a tax credit to offset some of the
cost of child care might stand a slightly better chance this year
because, to appeal to Republicans, the administration added a
modest new benefit for parents who stay home to take care of their
own children.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton recommended increasing to 50 percent from 30 percent the
proportion of child-care costs that could be written off by
families with annual incomes below $30,000. The credit would be
gradually reduced for families with incomes between $30,000 and
$59,000 and would be 20 percent of allowable expenses for those
with incomes above $59,000.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the president proposed an extra tax cut of up to
$250 for families with infants who have not reached their first
birthday. This credit would be available even if the family had no
child-care expenses because a stay-at-home parent or unpaid
relative watched the infant.
</P>
<P>
   The tax credit for long-term care expenses would cost $5 billion
over five years. The expanded child-care credit would cost slightly
more than $6 billion over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting the cigarette-tax increase, these are among the
largest of the president's tax proposals. In a budget with total
five-year revenues of about $10 trillion, they are hardly more than
asterisks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many of the president's tax proposals have been offered in the
past and have been rejected out of hand by Congress. Among these
are arcane proposals to change the way airline tickets are taxed,
to alter the tax rules on exports by manufacturers and to raise
taxes on certain life-insurance transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The House Ways and Means Committee staff experts calculated on
Monday that 35 of the 81 revenue increases in the budget are
essentially repeats of measures that were rejected last year. Of
the $82 billion in additional revenue proposed, more than $60
billion would be accounted for by these reprised offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The budget describes many of these proposals as attempts to
``eliminate unwarranted benefits.'' But the beneficiaries obviously
do not view them that way, and the Republican Congress has been
reluctant to end any but the most indefensible tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   As a political matter, the battle over taxes this year is not
likely to be over whether these small tax breaks are justified, but
rather over the broader question of whether part of the budget
surplus should be used for an across-the-board tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans argue that it is much more efficient economically to
give everyone a tax reduction than to follow Clinton's course and
give small tax cuts for particular purposes like school
construction or promotion of energy efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The president has threatened to veto an overall tax cut, saying
wealthy people would be the big winners.

FISHER KEY TO FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Lakers are working to lock up
another player, but his hair isn't red, he's not covered in tattoos
and frankly, no one's ever accused Derek Fisher of being ``a
thug.''
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, the Lakers' starting point guard is one of the
most polite, most !ital!normal players in the NBA, and a
much-improved player at that. His solid work as the starter for the
last half of last season enabled the Lakers to jettison tempestuous
Nick Van Exel and place their championship hopes in Fisher's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Now the free-agent-to-be is hoping for a contract extension, for
the maximum six years. The Lakers _ who incidentally have no
interest in Dennis Rodman, despite Shaquille O'Neal's recent plea
to acquire ``a thuggish forward'' _ have opened contract
discussions with Fisher's agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've expressed some interest in going ahead and trying to
wrap it up,'' Fisher said. ``Basically, it's just a matter of
reaching terms that are reasonable and fair to both parties.''
</P>
<P>
   When the issue was Kobe Bryant, that was an easy call, and the
Lakers quickly gave their budding star a contract for the maximum,
$70.9 million. Like Bryant, Fisher is in the final season of his
three-year rookie contract. Unlike Bryant, an All-Star at age 19,
Fisher has not established his market value, so a deal might take
more time.
</P>
<P>
   Teams have until March 13 to sign players to extensions and the
Lakers prefer to evaluate Fisher for the next six weeks, if not the
entire season, before making a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our feeling is he is going to continue to improve,''
general manager Mitch Kupchak said. ``We'd rather he get a chance
to play and establish the type of player he is. If we could see him
play out the year with the team, where he's THE guy, it may be
easier for everyone. He deserves the chance to prove he's the point
guard for this team.''
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old from Arkansas-Little Rock was the Lakers'
first-round draft pick, No. 24 overall, in 1996, but didn't make an
impression until last February, when a knee injury knocked Van Exel
out of action.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher responded in impressive fashion, so much so that when Van
Exel returned, he elected to be the backup. The Lakers compiled a
29-7 record (.806) with Fisher at the helm, including a 22-3 finish
to the regular season, and he averaged 8.4 points and 5.7 assists
as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Now Fisher begins his first season as the No. 1 point guard,
with a nice reward awaiting if he continues to improve at the same
rate. No one expects Fisher to become the scoring threat Van Exel
(14.9 points/game career average) was, but if he dishes out assists
and defense, that should be enough on a team with plenty of
scorers.
</P>
<P>
   And though he'd like the security of a multimillion-dollar
long-term contract, Fisher understands if the Lakers decide to wait
for a month, or five.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're at a point with me right now where I still have some
things to prove,'' he said. ``They may want to wait the whole year,
and that's fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think they understand how the (free-agency) process
works, and the longer you wait, the costlier it gets. You have to
deal with how other people view me and value me. But they'll handle
it the best way they know how, and I think the fairest way.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Familiar five: When the Lakers open the season Friday against
Houston, coach Del Harris will probably use the same starting five
that finished last season. And he's shelved for now the concept of
rotating Eddie Jones, Rick Fox and Kobe Bryant as starters at
shooting guard and small forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's gotta be good reason to change your lineup. Right now
we don't have that,'' Harris said. ``But it's always open to
adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   So expect a lineup of Fisher, Jones, Fox, O'Neal and Robert
Horry on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As for using the three-man rotation, ``probably not,'' Harris
said, but noted, ``As the season goes on, you've always got to keep
various options open.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris floated the rotation idea last week, but none of the
three players seemed to embrace it and Jones seemed particularly
bothered by it. Harris didn't consult the players directly.
</P>
<P>
   __ Last hurrah? Harris, in the final year of his contract, said
he's not concerned over his job status but let on that he did have
other opportunities elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying which teams, but I was contacted by two
different teams,'' Harris said. ``I said, `No, I don't want to go.'
''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to elaborate on the type of positions offered,
saying only, ``I definitely could have gone to two different teams,
for a lot more time and a lot more money, but I wanted to coach
this team.''
</P>
<P>
   For a simple reason: ``I think we can win the championship.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Ouch report: Sean Rooks did not attend Monday's practice and
is suffering from the flu, according to a team spokesman. Corie
Blount is suffering from tendinitis in his left knee and watched
practice from the sidelines.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ermenegildo Zegna, the venerable Italian suit maker,
is hoping that the most valuable player in the Super Bowl will be
just as valuable as a pitchman for its new athletic line, to be
introduced next fall.
</P>
<P>
   John Elway, the quarterback of the Denver Broncos, has been
signed to be one of the stars of the marketing campaign for the
line, Zegna Sport, said Tom Mastronardi, a partner in
Beauchamp/Mastronardi &AMP; Associates, a New York company, which is
developing the campaign. It will also feature the quarterbacks Dan
Marino and Troy Aiken.
</P>
<P>
   Zegna, a private company, is a powerful but sleepier version of
Italian glamour labels like Giorgio Armani and Nino Cerruti. Zegna
is the safe bread and butter of luxury menswear in stores like
Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue. Sales for Zegna were $125
million in the United States in 1998, said Richard Cohen, the chief
executive of Ermenegildo Zegna USA.
</P>
<P>
   Armani, Prada and Tommy Hilfiger have all spun off designer
sports and sneaker lines. Zegna Sport will include functional
athletic clothes with an average price of $75 for a polo shirt or
sweat pants. Since men, no matter their income, tend to buy less
expensive sports brands like Adidas or Champion, Zegna Sport will
have to compete with this segment of the market, as well as with
high-priced labels.
</P>
<P>
   The clothes are being pitched to customers over 35. ``On their
weekends, apart from responsibilities of family and children, they
like to get out there and do something _ golf, tennis,'' Cohen
said.
</P>
<P>
   A Zegna Sport store is planned for fall at 305 North Rodeo Drive
in Beverly Hills, Calif., next to an existing Zegna store. The line
will also be in Zegna's six other American stores and in department
stores.
</P>
<P>
   From Street Wear to Suits
</P>
<P>
   The success of Fubu, a hip street-wear company, has meant that
its four owners find themselves invited to evening events a lot
more often. But the casual garb that has made Fubu a $350 million
company is rarely appropriate. So, the company has signed a deal to
start its own tailored suit and sportswear line this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to start purchasing suits and so on for ourselves,''
said Daymond John, who started the company a few years ago in the
basement of his Queens home. ``We saw what we wanted, but at
exorbitant prices.''
</P>
<P>
   But can Fubu, whose name is an acronym for ``For us, by us,''
parlay its street credibility to the office? Richard Pietrafesa,
the president of the Pietrafesa Corp. in Syracuse, which has made
menswear for Brooks Brothers and Ralph Lauren, believes it will
work. Pietrafesa has signed a licensing deal with Fubu to produce
three collections. ``The name has tremendous appeal across a wide
range of constituents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John, whose partners are Keith Perrin, Carl Brown and J.
Alexander Martin, said he expected Fubu's current fans to buy the
new line. ``My present customers are a lot of Wall Street guys who
dress down in Fubu on the weekends,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom of Finland in Chelsea
</P>
<P>
   Attracted by the galleries, the affluent gay population and a
hunch that Chelsea may be the next high-fashion mecca, Tom of
Finland menswear will open its first store in the neighborhood next
week.
</P>
<P>
   The store will be at 261 West 19th St. Instead of showing during
the menswear collections, which begin next week, Tom of Finland's
designers, David Johnson and Gary Robinson, plan to have a party
with informal modeling on Feb. 11 in the shop. Coincidentally, a
Comme des Garcons boutique, which moved from SoHo, is scheduled to
open the day before at 520 West 22d St.
</P>
<P>
   The Tom of Finland boutique will carry jeans, biker jackets,
outerwear and special leather pieces, with prices from about $45 to
more than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the neighborhood's influx of galleries, the
boutique Tom of Finland, which is named for the illustrator of
erotic, muscle-bound gay men, is designed to house small art
exhibitions. ``Most important is the whole gay angle,'' Johnson
said. But he added, ``The nongay people in that area, people who
are interested in artwork, all that foot traffic will come into the
store.'' &QL;

COMMENTARY: ONE NATION, DEVOURED BY SPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By the time Super Bowl XXXIII gasped to an end on
Sunday night, there could not be a soul left in this city to doubt
the dominance of sports in our social, political and, yes, moral
universe. Let's not even discuss the XI hours of Sunday football
programming on Fox television or the numbing M's of words inspired
by this rather dull game.
</P>
<P>
   New York, which likes to think of itself as impervious to any
outside force short of a nuclear attack, was transformed on Super
Sunday. Streets were fairly empty, restaurants uncrowded and
theater lines short _ all because gargantuan men from Denver and
Atlanta were smashing into one another on the tube.
</P>
<P>
   With so many people eating in, the police decided to crack down
on the scourge of many New Yorkers: deliverymen on bicycles. These
are mostly sympathetic fellows, low-paid and hard-working. But if
you have ever been clipped or scared half to death by one of them
riding on the sidewalk or going the wrong way on a one-way street,
you know the problem.
</P>
<P>
   While the game was on, officers from the XX Precinct _ OK, no
more; that's the 20th Precinct _ set up in a spread formation on
the Upper West Side, flagging down restaurant deliverers flouting
the law. ``Operation Halftime,'' they jauntily called it.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 62 summonses were issued. Many food pedalers had their
bikes confiscated.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to the dinners they were carrying remains a
mystery. A police spokeswoman and officers at the precinct said
they had no idea. For all anyone knows, some West Siders are still
waiting for their pizzas and steamed dumplings.
</P>
<P>
   No matter where the food wound up, many in Manhattan were no
doubt thrilled by this crackdown. The recklessness of some cyclists
is alarming.
</P>
<P>
   But a closer look suggests that the summonses may not have
struck at the heart of the problem. Of the 62 handed out, 55 were
for not displaying proper identification or for lacking required
bike equipment like lights or horns. Only five were for riding the
wrong way, along with one for bicycling on the sidewalk and one for
going through a red light.
</P>
<P>
   That's not terribly many, when you think about it. Those last
violations are what set New Yorkers' teeth to gnashing, not
handlebars without bells.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe takeout restaurants saw the light and ordered their
deliverers to shape up. Or maybe the police are still fine-tuning
their search and seizure techniques. Oscar night in late March
offers them another opportunity. They could get in the Hollywood
spirit by dubbing the operation ``Saving General Tso.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the social aspects of professional athletics.
</P>
<P>
   For the political effects, look at the latest budget proposal
from the sports-minded mayor, Rudolph Giuliani. He has talked about
building no fewer than six stadiums and arenas that could
eventually cost a billion dollars or two: ball parks for the
Yankees and the Mets; a football stadium on the West Side, next to
a new Madison Square Garden, and new ball parks on Staten Island
and in Brooklyn for minor-league teams.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the mayor likes sports so much that his administration
has given the Yankees and the Mets grants of $3 million each to
help them figure out what kinds of stadiums they would like, and
where. Good thing he has shrunk the welfare rolls so that money is
available to assist such needy enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   As for moral import, it is hard to beat the stir caused by the
Knicks' hiring of Latrell Sprewell, a talented basketball player
best known for having choked his coach. And just before the Super
Bowl, the great former Giant, Lawrence Taylor, was voted into the
Pro Football Hall of Fame. There was a lot of hand-wringing over
whether this was the right thing to do. Taylor has had trouble
staying away from crack cocaine and from the back seats of police
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Expect such morality debates to be repeated, Jeff Benedict said
Monday. ``People get pretty emotional over issues like this,'' said
Benedict, co-author of ``Pros and Cons: The Criminals Who Play in
the NFL'' (Warner Books). This recent study discovered that one of
five pro football players had been charged with serious crimes,
with roughly half found guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict also noted that what counts to football's mandarins is
a person's performance on the field, not off it. He made no
reference, in this context, to the Senate impeachment trial.

OLD-FASHIONED ARRANGER FOR A LONELY CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Interviewing Dan Field is not hard work. ``Relax,''
he says, grabbing a reporter's tape recorder. ``I'll take over.''
</P>
<P>
   He turns to a photographer. ``Let me tell you how to make a good
picture,'' he says. ``Number one, like this, like a businessman.''
He strikes a pose against the desk in his tiny office near Grand
Central Terminal, jutting out his chest. Then he goes to a filing
cabinet, grinning as he opens a drawer stuffed with thousands of
smudged index ards.
</P>
<P>
   If this seems only a little pushy, it is because arranging
things is what Field has done for more than 40 years, and what his
uncle did before him and his grandfather, Rabbi Joseph Field,
before that, in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Field is a professional matchmaker. And February for him is like
November for a turkey farmer. ``Business is good,'' he says.
``People are lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly oblivious to every upheaval in the world of love
during the last four decades _ the sexual revolution, casual
cohabitation, personal ads, the Internet and even _ perish the
thought _ women asking out men, Field bristles at the words
``dating service.'' He once called himself a marriage broker, like
his uncle, Irving Field, but that is now illegal under federal law.
Whatever it is called, Field, owner of Field's Exclusive Service,
does it the same way he always has.
</P>
<P>
   His office has no computers. The walls are carpeted and
decorated with thousands of pictures, including one of Field as a
guest on ``The Mike Douglas Show'' in the 1970s with Joan Rivers
and Jack Klugman.
</P>
<P>
   The lovelorn _ once mostly Jewish, but now from all backgrounds,
he says _ drop by and describe themselves and the kind of mates
they are looking for. Field and his 32-year-old grandson, Joseph
Speyer, fill out index cards. Later, the two thumb through hundreds
of other cards in the big gray filing cabinet, and mail clients the
names and numbers of possible matches.
</P>
<P>
   They still encourage the women to wait to be called. And to the
men, they still send letters with guidelines straight out of Emily
Post: ``In order to make a good appearance to the ladies, always be
dressed up.'' The rest, Field says, is up to fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``No gimmicks,'' he says. ``I see the person. A computer, you
only press buttons.'' He adds: ``On the Internet or whatever you
want to call it, how do you know who's this person? You know how
many killings there were already from the Internet? They met each
other and they killed each other? I have papers.'' He begins to
rummage in a stack of newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, though, Field has begun to generate a
few bad headlines of his own. Two city councilmen held a news
conference in front of his office last year, saying that clients
had complained that they were pressured to pay for extra services,
like haircuts and makeovers, after already paying up to $1,000 in
fees. The Better Business Bureau sent him a letter in January 1998,
saying it had received 16 complaints about his service in 36
months, earning him an unsatisfactory rating with the consumer
group.
</P>
<P>
   Field insists that he has never pressured anyone to do anything,
although he does urge people to look nice for dates. He adds that
complaints are inevitable in a business that deals in hope and
fragile emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can write into the Better Business Bureau,'' he says.
``I call them the Better Baloney Business.''
</P>
<P>
   He has a theory about what makes clients generally less
satisfied than clients were back when he began matchmaking with his
uncle. ``Today, the more educated they are, the better looking they
are, the bigger problem they have,'' he says. ``They don't know
what they want. They pass 30, already there is a little problem.
They get set in their ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in his day, he added, people came in, they got married and
``they stayed married, like concrete.''
</P>
<P>
   The only problem with Field's reminiscences _ and many other
things he says _is that they tend to change a little with the
telling. At one point, he says his father came from Poland to the
United States, and kept his grandfather's matchmaking tradition
alive. Later, he says that all of his immediate family disappeared
in the Holocaust and that he alone was saved, a boy of 11 sent out
on a ship ``with a label around my neck, like I was a package.''
</P>
<P>
   He will spell his name for you: ``F-I-E-L-D-S.'' His grandson,
who has been working with him for a dozen years, corrects: ``No
S.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever,'' Field says, brushing him away.
</P>
<P>
   Asked his age, he says: ``Nobody knows how old they are from
Europe. It's how old you feel.'' Asks how old he feels, he says,
his eyes sparkling: ``The middle 60s.'' (His grandson says he is
probably somewhere in his 70s.)
</P>
<P>
   He says he has worked hard in the matchmaking business, and that
it has treated him well. He estimates he has served about 120,000
clients. He has no idea how many ended up with lasting
relationships, but one of those who did was a young woman named
Lillian Horowitz, whom Field married. ``Uncle Irving told me, `Dan,
it's time for you to get married. Call this girl.''' They were
married for 53 years and lived in Scarsdale, N.Y. Mrs. Field died
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Field says he has always worked seven days a week, and he will
keep it up until he loses his knack: ``Right now, I still have it.
Sometimes a man says, `Give me this, give me that,' and I send him
altogether the opposite. `That's what I was looking for!' he
says.''

GLUT OF MINOR CASES SWAMPS NEW YORK'S COURTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City's Criminal Courts are overwhelmed by a
flood of cases as the Police Department, responding to Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani's quality-of-life campaign, makes hundreds of
thousands of arrests a year for everything from subway fare beating
to reckless bicycle riding to marijuana possession.
</P>
<P>
   Major crime is at a record low in the city, but judges, lawyers
and court administrators say the crush of lesser offenses is
delaying trials, leading to an increase in dismissed cases and
requiring witnesses and defendants to return to court repeatedly to
resolve minor cases.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the logjam is simple. The number of judges has
stayed roughly the same, while misdemeanor cases have soared by 85
percent since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors complain that savvy defendants play the trial delays
to their advantage, hoping that the deadline for trial will pass or
that discouraged victims will eventually give up. ``They manipulate
the system until they get the charges dismissed,'' said the
Manhattan district attorney, Robert Morgenthau.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, the percentage of charges dismissed because the
legal deadline for a speedy trial has passed has increased by 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Defendants complain that trying to fight even minor charges
takes so long that going to court is a punishment in its own right.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have jobs, people have things they need to do and you
make them come back to court five, six or seven times,'' said
Michelle Maxian, the Legal Aid Society's director of litigation.
``People lose respect for and faith in the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is occurring in other parts of the country, said
Neal Kauder, a researcher for the National Center for State Courts.
Despite decreases in major crimes, a combination of tougher laws,
federally funded anti-drug efforts and bigger local law-enforcement
agencies have meant many more drug arrests. At the same time, he
said, courts have not grown to handle the volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emphasis is on law enforcement, not on the judiciary,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, there is a seemingly simple solution: hiring more
judges. Court administrators say New York City needs 23 more
Criminal Court judges, but getting them is politically difficult.
Republicans and Democrats in Albany guard judgeships as valuable
political appointments, and they have been unable to reach a
compromise on increasing the number of judges around the state.
</P>
<P>
   Another solution would be moving justices from the city's
Supreme Courts, which hear more serious felony cases, to Criminal
Court. Felony cases have leveled off with the drop in crime, but
shifting justices would essentially mean demoting the system's more
experienced and, in some cases, most politically connected judges.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the city's courts remain set up to handle the flood
of drug-related felonies of the 1980s and early 1990s, and have not
adjusted to the drop in major crimes and the new police emphasis on
lower-level offenses.

EDITORIAL: BRUTALITY INQUIRY AT THE NASSAU JAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Tuesday, Feb. 2: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By its own admission, the Nassau County district attorney's
office has bungled the job of investigating and prosecuting
brutality charges lodged by inmates against guards at the Nassau
County jail. But beyond failing to surmount some of the usual
obstacles _ guards unwilling to testify against their brethren and
reliance on overworked investigators _ this office seems paralyzed
by a debilitating mindset articulated by Frank Quigley, chief of
special investigations for District Attorney Denis Dillon. ``Does
society tolerate this kind of abuse?'' Quigley told The Times'
David Halbfinger. ``In the cold light of day, no. But in their
secret heart of hearts, the answer may be different.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude and the office's lackluster record in pursuing
charges of prisoner abuse are profoundly disturbing. That makes
Dillon's decision, reached Monday, to defer his own inquiry a
welcome development. Zachary Carter, U.S. Attorney for New York's
Eastern District, and the FBI will now take charge of what should
become a wide-ranging look into a raft of allegations of brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Pizzuto's death last month has heightened concern. A
recovering heroin addict serving a 90-day sentence for traffic
violations, Pizzuto died Jan. 13 from injuries sustained while he
was in the custody of guards, which the county Medical Examiner and
investigators say are consistent with assault. His death has been
ruled a homicide.
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights prosecution Carter promises should help
determine what new policies and procedures the county jail needs.
Dillon's call for the use of video cameras to document inmate
treatment is a long-overdue reform. It should be combined with
strict policies that can prevent a recurrence of the kind of
lawlessness Americans generally associate with rogue regimes, not
local agencies they pay taxes to support.
</P>
<P>
   Dillon and Carter also agreed Monday that federal grand jury
procedures, evidentiary requirements and penalties were superior to
those available under state law. Only a thorough federal inquiry
and reform can reassure New Yorkers that every agency of their
criminal justice system has the safeguards necessary to prevent
brutality and to uphold the Constitution.

LAST NCAA TEAM WITHOUT A VICTORY, MONMOUTH ENDS 0-22 FAMINE
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST LONG BRANCH, N.J. _ Monmouth University forward Alpha
Bangura flung the basketball to the ceiling as the buzzer sounded
Monday night, ending the game and a drought. Students of this
school less than a mile from the Jersey Shore emptied from the
gymnasium bleachers, storming the court wave upon wave.
</P>
<P>
   As the public address system played the song ``Celebration'' and
players and fans united in a group hug at center court, the crowd
of 1,117 did not chant, ``We're No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   They could have chanted, ``That's one.''
</P>
<P>
   With a dramatic second-half comeback, Monmouth, which had been
the only Division I team in the nation without a victory this
season, defeated Wagner, 66-61, at Boylan Gymnasium. Monmouth,
which qualified for the National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament only three years ago, improved its season record to
1-19.
</P>
<P>
   The victory also ended Monmouth's 22-game losing streak, which
was the longest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt a little like we were going to the NCAAs,'' said guard
Maurice Williams, the lone holdover from Monmouth's 1996 NCAA team.
``It was kind of reminiscent.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bangura, the end of the game was a release.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was four months of frustration,'' Bangura said. ``That's 20
games and a lot of practices to get one win. It shouldn't take that
long, but when we got it, it was exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dave Calloway, who starts three freshman and has lost six
players from his program for various reasons in the past year,
spent the past week answering questions about the streak in part
because it was assumed that Monmouth's game with Wagner (5-15)
might be its best _ or last _ chance to win a game this season.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Calloway's first reaction following Monday
night's victory was one of relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt relief for me but even more relief for the guys,'' said
Calloway, who took over the program when long-time coach Wayne
Szoke resigned a year ago with Monmouth's record at 1-13. ``For
them, it's hard to keep working. It's been tough. In yesterday's
practice, I questioned their toughness. But by this response, they
proved me wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The Division I basketball record for successive losses is 37
games, by the Citadel in the 1954-55 season.
</P>
<P>
   If the crowd Monday night was stirred up by the game's end, it
could have been because of Monmouth's rousing rally to win its
first game since last Feb. 16, also against Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   With 7 minutes 35 seconds to play in the second half, Wagner led
by 53-47. Behind Williams, Monmouth went on an 11-2 run, taking a
3-point lead with three minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   Williams scored 9 of his game-high 19 points in that span. In
the final minute, as Wagner fouled in an attempt to get back in the
game, Bangura sank four consecutive free throws to extend
Monmouth's lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``In practice every day, the coaches have been putting 10
minutes on the clock to get us to concentrate on playing the last
10 minutes with good focus and execution,'' Williams said. ``It's
been a drill so we won't let down. And tonight it paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner Coach Tim Capstraw noticed the same thing. Of Monmouth,
Capstraw said: ``Their team has had a lot of good 35 minute games.
This time, they had a good last five minutes, too.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if it was especially difficult to be the first team
to lose to Monmouth this season, Capstraw said: ``I'll be honest
with you, I have my own problems. We had respect for them. We're
not that strong a team to have looked at it any other way.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory seemed to put a charge into the Monmouth campus with
a large crowd remaining in the gymnasium even after the players
headed to their locker room. ``We've gotten overwhelming support,''
Calloway said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Williams: ``No one on campus has said anything cruel to
me. It's tough because I've seen this place when we really were
heading to the NCAAs. I want to get that back.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're here because we love playing basketball and we loved
it even with all the losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bangura felt Monday night's victory might spark a turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not giving up yet,'' Bangura, a freshman, said. ``Monmouth
has a lot of plans. I've got a lot of plans.''
</P>
<P>
   And now it will even be a little easier for the Monmouth
cheerleaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard sometimes to raise spirit in the gym when you're
0-19,'' said Gail Chance, a junior from East Brunswick. ``But we
always came here each game thinking that this time we had a
chance.'' &QL;

HUNTZ HALL, PERPETUAL YOUTH IN `BOWERY' FILMS, DIES AT 78
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (ms) 
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Huntz Hall, who for 20 years played the slow-witted sidekick of
Leo Gorcey in more than 80 ``Bowery Boys,'' ``Dead End Kids'' and
``East Side Kids'' movies, died Jan. 30 in Los Angeles. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cardiac disease, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely, if ever, has a bit of Broadway casting led to as many
lucrative replays and adaptations of the same roles, as when Hall,
Gorcey and four other young actors appeared as New York street
toughs in Sidney Kingsley's 1935 play ``Dead End.''
</P>
<P>
   Peppering their speech with ``dese,'' ``dem'' and ``dose,'' the
six portrayed the hard-luck solidarity of poor teen-agers who,
seeing few alternatives to lawlessness, find themselves impressed
by criminals. The youths, who were shown diving into an orchestra
pit transformed into the East River, had a powerful impact in
establishing the play's realism.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing it for The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson wrote,
``The boys' parts are played with such authenticity that there was
a foul sidewalk canard last evening that a mob of East Side street
arabs had been carried west in their street clothes. Certainly the
pitch of their voices has the piercing note of the tenement
streets.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact the performers were all experienced actors. Hall, who
was 15 at the time, had been performing on radio since he was 5 and
had long since changed his given name of Henry for the notable and
indeterminately ethnic Huntz. Born in New York, he was one of 14
children of an Irish-born engineer.
</P>
<P>
   When Samuel Goldwyn produced the 1937 film version of ``Dead
End,'' adapted by Lillian Hellman and directed by William Wyler,
the six juveniles served as something of a Greek chorus, variously
tempted and repelled by the older characters played by Humphrey
Bogart, Joel McCrea and Sylvia Sidney. As in the play, Hall played
the character called Dippy.
</P>
<P>
   The movie was a hit, and the Dead Enders _ Hall, Gorcey, Gabriel
Dell, Billy Halop, Bobby Jordan and Bernard Punsley _ became such
stars that within two years Warner Bros. rushed production of six
more films in which they portrayed roughly the same group of
wayward teen-agers, more victimized by society than victimizers. In
these films Hall may well have anticipated the contemporary custom
of wearing a baseball cap with its bill askew or turned backward.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the new films were variations on the theme of
``Dead End.'' In urban settings, still tinged by the Depression,
the films' anti-heroes were criminals or suspects in crime, played
by stars such as Bogart, in ``Crime School'' 1938), James Cagney in
``Angels With Dirty Faces''(1938) and John Garfield in ``They Made
Me a Criminal''(1939). The young men always struggled with their
feelings toward these notorious neighborhood luminaries.
</P>
<P>
   By 1940 the genre had changed, and the Dead End Kids' movies had
more in common with the older Our Gang comedies than with any
realistic portrayals of society's lower depths. In these film
comedies the gang took on counterfeiters, spies, safe crackers,
kidnappers and jewel thieves. No longer were the Dead Enders
ambiguous or torn in their sympathies; they were full-fledged good
guys.
</P>
<P>
   During the war years Hall appeared in nine films for Universal
in which he was usually called Pig. Another series for Monogram
Pictures cast the rubber-faced, pop-eyed Hall in his usual role of
a good-natured dumb guy.
</P>
<P>
   Finally in 1946 came the first of the ``Bowery Boys'' series, in
which Gorcey played Slip Mahoney, the ring leader, and Hall was
Sach Jones, his sidekick. In all, 48 films were made. In the last
one, ``In the Money'' (1958), a 38-year-old Hall is once more the
perpetual adolescent, dog-sitting a poodle on a cruise as nefarious
thieves try to steal a diamond hidden on the dog.
</P>
<P>
   With the passage of the Bowery Boys, Hall continued to act in
television shows and movies. In 1977 he played the role of a movie
mogul in Ken Russell's ``Valentino.'' He performed in dinner
theater productions but retired in 1994 after the death of his
fourth wife.
</P>
<P>
   Hall is survived by a son, the Rev. Gary Hall of Pasadena,
Calif., and a grandson.
</P>
<P>
   With his death the only original Dead End kid still alive is
Punsley, who left the group to attend medical school.

<P>
   Scientists have believed for some time that HIV-1, the AIDS
virus that has infected 30 million humans worldwide, originated in
a primate species somewhere in Africa. Now a team of researchers
led by Dr. Beatrice Hahn from the University of Alabama has
confirmed that the source of HIV-1 is almost certainly a subspecies
of chimpanzee called Pan troglodytes troglodytes. This central
African subspecies carries a simian version of HIV-1, which was
probably transmitted to humans who butchered hunted chimpanzees or
handled their meat. Chimpanzees carry the simian version, called
SIVcpz, without falling ill. It may be possible to discover in
their adaptation to this virus a means of blocking the further
spread of HIV-1.
</P>
<P>
   The story of this discovery has a corollary. Pan troglodytes
troglodytes is still being hunted, and with a rapacity that will
guarantee its extinction before long. Chimpanzee meat, gathered by
commercial hunters, feeds loggers in central Africa and even makes
its way into urban restaurants. The issue is not just the danger of
further cross-species transmission of the retrovirus, tragic as
that would be. It is the destruction of a vital genetic reservoir _
the potential source of major innovations in AIDS research _ before
research can really get under way. Before the significance of this
new discovery can be assessed, it has to be studied among
populations of free-living chimpanzees belonging to this
subspecies. That will not be possible if they have been hunted to
extinction.
</P>
<P>
   There could be no clearer demonstration of the immediate human
value of preserving biodiversity. The health of our species depends
directly on the breadth of the global genetic pool to which we
belong. The cure for disease, as scientists have often
demonstrated, can come from the same source as the disease itself.
But as always, recognizing the (italics)human(end italics) value of
biodiversity _ the utility of these chimpanzees to us _ carries
with it a sense of profound sadness, an awareness of how hard it is
to value biodiversity for itself. There is still a chance to save
these animals, and with luck this new discovery will make their
survival more likely. &QL;

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: IN `SPIN CITY,' MASTERS OF THEIR NON-NEW YORK
DOMAIN
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ All right, we all knew ``Seinfeld,'' and ``Spin
City'' is no ``Seinfeld.'' But the resemblances are there,
conspicuously the New York setting if not its ambience and the
dependable shticks of its residents. Comfortably into its third
season, ``Spin City'' is holding its own, a tribute to its quirky
characters and their comical collisions. There are many nights when
the ensemble at an improbable City Hall is at least as funny as the
gang at the relatively realistic Upper West Side diner used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anybody can ignore the differences. Seinfeld and his
pals, even those operating under different ethnic disguises,
kvetched in television's copyright New York Jewish manner.
Curiously for New York by contrast, the mayor's office spinning at
the center of ``Spin City,'' otherwise a weekly buffet of mockable
diversity by sex, race and so forth, does not include that
particular stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   Even Indian cab drivers, equipped with truculent accents of some
sort, got a jolly going-over recently in an episode about a taxi
strike: ``We've had a number of complaints from pedestrians.''
``About what?'' ``Apparently you keep running into them.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is only by way of observing that although decorated with
familiar places, this really isn't a New York show. Instead, it's
about a clubby batch of outsiders who have somehow found jobs in
what is labeled City Hall, as if to demonstrate that they can make
it anywhere. In the amiable array of made-for-television eccentrics
you will not spot one who might be classified as a Manhattan type.
Yet all are Seinfeldish in their self-absorption and their
merciless scrutiny of everyone else's weaknesses and compulsions,
the amusing tics of a smartly scripted series that only
occasionally dips into sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Fox, the ever-in-motion star who won a Golden Globe
last week playing a brogueless Deputy Mayor Michael Flaherty, is
frenetically at work getting his boss into or out of hot water
(which his honor rarely notices he is in) and pursuing romance
while racing away from it like any certified neurotic. When our
Michael gets too close to commitment, he has breathing problems. He
and Connie Britton, whose last name is supposed to be Faber, have
something for each other, which you can bet will remain shakily
unresolved as long as they keep meeting around the candy machine
with a mind of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are those endearingly odd roommates _ Michael
Boatman, the black representative of middle-class homosexual
gentility, and Alan Ruck, the determinedly vulgar white
heterosexual trapped forever in his teens _ who are equipped with
vaudeville cracks at the expense of each other's sexual
proclivities. There's Paul (Richard Kind), the ingenuously devious,
implacably maladroit press spokesman, and young James (Alexander
Chaplin), adrift from some Gothic all-American town and without a
place to park. And there's an outer-borough sexpot (Jennifer
Esposito) with an uncurable yet wholesome lech. And there's a
suicidal dog.
</P>
<P>
   They and others all have their moments, but the truly brilliant
``Spin City'' invention is Mayor Randall Winston, a WASP of eerie
calm in the midst of the bustle. Played with finely tuned vagueness
by Barry Bostick, he is the ultimate outsider (as well as the one
cast regular of a certain age), oblivious to distraction as he
tries to figure out whither his unflappable muse calls. While Mike
is conspiring to fix a dam that has more leaks than he has fingers,
the mayor resides Zen-like high above the flood, as well as several
heads above his diminutive troubleshooter.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Seinfeld'' was topical in a social-comment way, as an
exercise in over-the-edge Upper West Side angst, ``Spin City'' is
often smack on the news. As I write this, a trash war is again
going on between New York and one of its selected garbage
depository towns far away. Fans will remember that very early in
the series in 1996, Michael, informed that his city contributes
more than its share to the nation's garbage dump, announced
triumphantly, ``We're No. 1!''
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of one-liners to pep up the action, plenty of
peculiarities of personality to grease an antic 22 minutes a week.
And even if a touch of desperation shows in an occasional plot that
flies out of control or in gags that do not bear yet another
go-round, the collective spirit generally prevails.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty part of sitcoms is that recycled jokes, shrewdly set
up, often provide heartier laughs than new ones. But then you don't
have to look and act like a New Yorker to figure that out.

`SURVIVING AIDS': HUNTING THE WEAK SIDE OF THE AIDS VIRUS
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are
for New York area. Check local listings.) 
(ms) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The encouraging news about AIDS, notably the ``cocktail'' drugs
that are keeping patients alive for years, is running up against
the discouraging cost of the drugs and their possible side effects.
So the incentive for developing a vaccine against the epidemic
remains strong. That is the starting point for Tuesday's careful
inquiry on ``Nova'' into new approaches that seem to hold out some
promise of success.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Surviving Aids'' explains early on, the special problem
about AIDS lies in the nature of HIV, a retrovirus that may linger
in cells for years as it destroy's the body's immune system.
Scientists fear that introducing even a small nontoxic dose as a
vaccine may prove to be a killer.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's glimmers of hope come from major research centers like
Massachusetts General Hospital, the Aaron Diamond Aids Center in
New York and the National Cancer Institute, where volunteer
patients have produced surprises about the apparent workings of
their immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Bill Massie, whose blood was found to contain
antibodies against HIV, proof that he was infected; yet there was
no trace of an active virus. The question is whether and how his
immune system was holding HIV in check. The answer points to the
workings of two sets of white blood cells, ``CD4 helper T cells''
and ``CD8 killer T cells.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't be put off by the mysterious labels. You'll have to watch
the program to get the intricate details, but the theory is that
the killer cells, usually helpless against HIV, are for some still
undetermined reason doing their job for Massie.
</P>
<P>
   The narrator sums up: ``Massie was breaking all the accepted
rules of HIV infection. His natural immune defenses were keeping
the virus under control.'' And he is opening up an entirely new
approach to understanding the virus.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, researchers have come upon another man, Steve
Crohn, who has remained uninfected despite repeated exposure to
HIV, and through him they are learning more about genes and the way
HIV works or fails to work. Count on the good old ``Nova''
animation to clarify matters for viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Other cases are explored, particularly the early and aggressive
use of cocktail drugs in hopes that they may turn out to produce
immunity. In one risky experiment, a patient has been taken off his
14 pills a day to test whether his immune system will kick in and
control the virus. No definite conclusion yet.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever the research may lead, ``Surviving AIDS'' offers an
intriguing look at current laboratory thinking as scientists follow
up on clues that may lead to making the program's title a reality
for many more patients.

WANT TO BE IN PICTURES? ALMOST ANYONE CAN, FOR FIVE SECONDS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The fate of ``At First Sight,'' the Irwin Winkler
film that opened to tepid reviews a few weeks ago, probably won't
depend on the publishing and real estate magnate Mort Zuckerman's
seconds-long performance as a surly, tattered homeless man.
</P>
<P>
   But Zuckerman's screen debut is a reminder that it may be time
to update Andy Warhol's dictum about everyone's getting 15 minutes
of fame. Now almost everyone seems to get at least five seconds of
it on screen.
</P>
<P>
   Cameo appearances seem to be more a creature of New York
filmmakers than Hollywood ones, and cameos hardly began in the 90s.
But vanity film roles seem to be one of the status symbols of the
90s. What they have to do with the business of making movies is
less clear.
</P>
<P>
   There are probably three main kinds of cameos. There is the
classic cameo performance, in which Hollywood actors show up in
small parts, like the actors who appear in Robert Altman movies
because of their admiration for his work. Then there are
recognizable people playing themselves or similar characters, like
the CNN reporters who showed up in ``Contact'' or Ivana Trump in
``The First Wives Club.'' Last, there are people not known as
actors who often are recognizable only to their friends, like
Zuckerman in his recent role.
</P>
<P>
   The Category 3 cameos are often byproducts of friendships, like
Zuckerman's with Winkler, rather than career moves, though some of
the actors tend to take them pretty seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The writer Calvin Trillin keeps a photograph of the marquee of
the Varsity Theater in Seattle prominently displayed on the
mantelpiece of his bedroom. It reads: ``Meg Ryan Calvin Trillin in
Sleepless in Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   The usual billing for the film went to Ms. Ryan and Tom Hanks,
who played a somewhat bigger role in the film than Trillin's brief
appearance at a Christmas dinner. In addition, Trillin played a
sheriff in ``Michael,'' a 1996 movie starring John Travolta that
was also directed by Trillin's friend Nora Ephron.
</P>
<P>
   Trillin concedes that his acting career at the moment seems
bound by the whims of Ms. Ephron, who regularly casts friends in
small roles in her movies and gives the characters in her films
names from her real life. But he maintains that his cinematic
oeuvre, particularly his sheriff's role, remains underappreciated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fantastic,'' reported Trillin, who said he prepared for
his role by reading and rereading the Texas Ranger creed every
morning: ``No man in the wrong can stand up against a fellow that's
in the right and keeps on a'comin'.'' Trillin added: ``When I got
into my sheriff's costume and walked onto the set, Nora, whom I've
known for 35 years, actually thought one of the law enforcement
officers had illegally parked his van outside and walked onto the
set. I was the sheriff.''
</P>
<P>
   The king of the cameos may be the author George Plimpton, whose
acting career dates back to his performance as one of 6,000
Bedouins in ``Lawrence of Arabia.'' Plimpton said he was there to
write about the film and ended up also appearing in it when its
director, David Lean, banished him to a Bedouin encampment.
</P>
<P>
   Since then his appearances have included ``The Detective'' with
Frank Sinatra, ``Rio Lobo'' with John Wayne, ``Reds,'' ``Religion
Inc.'' (an early Sandra Bullock film), ``Little Man Tate,''
``Bonfire of the Vanities,'' ``Nixon'' and ``L.A. Story,'' in which
he played a weatherman whose line was ``Sunny, 79 degrees
Fahrenheit.'' His most recent role was as a psychiatrist in ``Good
Will Hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   Woody Allen, since his early days of putting Howard Cosell in
``Bananas'' and Marshall McLuhan in ``Annie Hall,'' has probably
been more prone to using cameo performances than any current
director.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years his films have included appearances by Benno
Schmidt Jr., former president of Yale University and current head
of the Edison Project educational company; Ms. Ephron, Donald
Trump, writers from Bruce Jay Friedman to Erica Jong, Itzhak
Perlman and his daughter Navah, Elle Macpherson, Saul Bellow, Susan
Sontag, and the former New York City mayor, Ed Koch.
</P>
<P>
   His most recent film, ``Celebrity,'' includes brief appearances
by Joey Buttafuoco, the director Andre Gregory, the fashion
designer Isaac Mizrahi, the actor and singer Robert Cuccioli and
Frank Pellegrino, owner of Rao's, an exclusive Manhattan
restaurant. Pellegrino also appeared in Allen's ``Broadway Danny
Rose'' and `Manhattan Murder Mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pellegrino is hardly the only restaurateur to enter the
cameo sweepstakes. ``Simply Irresistible,'' a forthcoming film
starring Sarah Michelle Gellar and set in the world of New York
restaurants, includes a brief performance by Drew Nieporent, an
owner of Montrachet, Layla, TriBeCa Grill and other Manhattan hot
spots. Viewers can give themselves two insider points if they spot
him.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, where filmmaking is no joking matter, people can
play the same game, but not everyone is taken with the idea of
vanity roles.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Press, director of marketing for Dreamworks, cited Alfred
Hitchcock's famous blink-and-you-miss-them appearances as the rare
examples of a shared joke that worked between a director and his
audience. No one would turn down a cameo by Leonardo DiCaprio (who
did one for Allen in ``Celebrity''), she said, but most cameos seem
of questionable value.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Landis used to do it ad nauseum,'' she added. ``The
problem with cameos is I'm never sure what they're done for. Is it
to say, `Hi, I'm a director, and I have these famous friends,' or
is it in support of the story?''
</P>
<P>
   The producer Don De Line said perhaps New York's fondness for
cameos suggested more of an appreciation for Hollywood than New
Yorkers tend to express.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like Mort Zuckerman and Donald Trump have everything
you could want, but I guess they still want to rub shoulders with
celebrities,'' he said. ``New Yorkers tend to mock Hollywood, but
at the end of the day, they're fascinated by it.''
</P>
<P>
   A multimillionaire having fun playing a homeless person may not
be everyone's idea of a good joke. Janet Maslin in The New York
Times described Zuckerman's cameo as a ``Marie Antoinette.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone offered me a dollar afterwards, I was so good, but I
told him I don't accept less than five,'' Zuckerman said.
</P>
<P>
   The rampant cameo turns is yet another example of the blurring
of the line between life and entertainment and of the endless
gradations of celebrity. Advertisers like to pepper their ads with
marginally famous or formerly famous or soon-to-be famous ``niche
celebrities'' who give knowing consumers a sense of being clued in
and hip.
</P>
<P>
   Plimpton may be on to something with his modest proposal for
recognizing the famous who labor in obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think they need to give out a little Oscar, a small
one, to people from other disciplines who appear in films,'' he
said. ``You think of Jerzy Kosinski in `Reds.' Gosh, he was good.
It's not easy. People get tongue-tied. I kept forgetting my lines
in `Nixon.' Why not some recognition?'' &QL;

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: THE CREAM STILL RISES, EVEN FROM BARREL BOTTOM
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Greenspan isn't a mere actor. He's an appliance
on the fritz. Plug him in and watch the mechanism go haywire: he
shakes and rattles, swivels and squeaks so persuasively you half
expect smoke to rise from a crack in his forehead.
</P>
<P>
   Onstage, his stock in trade is the alien among us, but not in
the vein of Mork from Ork. Greenspan, an Obie-winning performer and
playwright, alights from somewhere beyond the outer limits. Whether
he's intimidating the other guests as a particularly spooky Harold
in ``The Boys in the Band'' or waxing oleaginous in an enigmatic
Mac Wellman extravaganza, he is always strung out in one way or
another, on a supercilious tear or on the brink of total
neurological collapse. And that's why he is ideal for ``High
Life,'' Lee MacDougall's new lowlife comedy at Primary Stages about
a cockeyed gang of junkie grifters who botch an ATM heist and end
up killing one of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Any week in New York City, you can find two or three new Off
Broadway plays that, like ``High Life,'' ruminate about lowlifes.
As the nation becomes ever more affluent, it seems, the theater
becomes increasingly obsessed with the drunk, the disorderly, the
dysfunctional. It's not a return to the 1960's and the theater of
social awareness, however; few in this genre are intended as
exercises in consciousness-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, many of these plays seek to capitalize on our insatiable
need for the goriest details and on our appetite for reminders of
what we all might easily become. They are, in their way, extreme
reactions to the sanitized domains of television sitcoms, where the
people and the apartments almost always are more attractive than
the real world.
</P>
<P>
   In ``High Life,'' the diminutive Greenspan is eminently
entertaining as Donnie, the most reptilian and tightly wound of a
quartet of sociopathic drug addicts in this only slightly
diverting, extended sketch of a play. Like the dramatic situation,
Greenspan's performance ultimately trails off into irrelevance. But
before that happens, the actor does something remarkable: he makes
the burnt-out ends of drug-filled days seem, well, funny. It's an
eccentrically winning embodiment of the effects of mind-altering
chemicals, in the tradition of Richard E. Grant's bravura turn as a
tanked-up, out-of-work actor in the cult film ``Withnail and I.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's impression of a human Osterizer is the best thing
about ``High Life,'' because it's so exhaustively resourceful in
ways the script does not appear to call for; even in obvious bits,
as when Donnie reports on his recent bout of pneumonia while
sucking on a cigarette, his work is fresh. Yet despite other
assets, including Casey Childs' crisp direction and Isiah Whitlock
Jr.'s flash-fire portrayal of one of Donnie's homicidal partners in
crime, ``High Life'' remains long on exposition and short on
revelation. In fact, given the plethora of plays these days that
sift society's dregs, the details of ``High Life'' are positively
fungible.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best of these lowlife dramas, with their echoes of
older playwrights like Sam Shepard, succeed because of
self-consciously withering humor (as in ``Killer Joe'') or
delicately textured atmosphere (``Ecstasy'') or devastatingly real
characters (``This Is Our Youth''). But many others are simply
imitative of better plays. They are flawed works that walk on the
dark side chiefly because that's where the theater crowd has taken
them.
</P>
<P>
   Three Off and Off Off Broadway productions that opened in recent
weeks _ MacDougall's ``High Life,'' Jessica Goldberg's ``Stuck''
and George F. Walker's ``End of Civilization'' _ fall into this
latter category. All serve up crime and degradation, but little in
the way of elucidation or even cheap thrills.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goldberg's play, for instance, produced by Rattlestick
Productions at the Theater Off Park, is a Gothic riff on ``Thelma
and Louise'' with a bit of Shepard's ``Buried Child'' thrown in.
Directed by Abby Epstein, it is the tale of two lost young women
working in a video store in ``Middletown, U.S.A.,'' and aching for
an escape from a stultifying life of alcoholic parents, predatory
men, tabloid-television culture and unwanted children.
</P>
<P>
   The relentlessly depressing outlook of ``Stuck'' is the opposite
of what we've come to accept as the American Dream, that children
born into an environment that chokes off hope use the negative
energy to their advantage. ``Hi, stupid baby! Who's the stupidest
baby?'' one of the video store women, played by Jenny Maguire, coos
nastily to the infant daughter she has carelessly brought into her
deadwood world. Ms. Maguire's Margaritah is a former high school
prom queen who falls in love with a right-wing Argentine
businessman (Michael Irby) whose father has bought the town's
pollution-spewing factory; her best friend, Lula (Jennifer Albano)
hits the bars and winds up in bed with the father of one of her old
school chums.
</P>
<P>
   Playing soul mates in benumbed despair, Ms. Albano and
particularly Ms. Maguire are heroically believable, and Ms.
Goldberg is skillful at the portrait of rapport. Evidence of a
sharp intellect is abundant, but as with ``High Life,'' ``Stuck''
lacks the forward thrust of compelling theater. Until the
horrifying final scene, which only reiterates rather than enlarges
the play's themes, the drama lives up to its name. By the time
``Stuck'' ends, it feels as if the story has only just begun.
</P>
<P>
   Walker's ``End of Civilization'' at Raw Space tries to add an
air of mystery to the lowlife genre, but all it really adds is
confusion. The play, which jumps around so arbitrarily that the
only time you can be sure of is the one on your wrist, takes place
in that lowlife staple, a tacky motel, where Henry and Lily, a
despairing, unemployed man and his dutiful wife, have taken a room
while he looks for work. During their short stay, a serial killer
starts knocking off job seekers in all the employment offices Henry
visits, while Lily takes up life as a hooker.
</P>
<P>
   The play offers some real howlers: ``I think Henry is going to
kill a lot of people because Henry is feeling very demeaned,'' Lily
helpfully informs the dimwitted detectives on the case. Of course,
it all ends with a single gunshot. This production, directed by
Randy White, inadvertently poses the question at the heart of all
down-and-dirty drama: How low, really, can you go?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is, when the theatrical experience is potent, there
is no bottom to the barrel. As demonstrated by Greenspan's
memorable work in ``High Life,'' the creepiest stage behavior,

WILL FLEURY JOIN KINGS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Hockey League's trading deadline is 49 days away
and it's a safe bet that at some point in the next seven weeks,
Calgary right wing and prospective unrestricted free agent Theoren
Fleury will be changing uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Several questions (with answers provided) emerge with this
likelihood:
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will Fleury wind up with the Los Angeles Kings? A: The Kings
are trying, but so are a lot of other teams.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What will it take to get him? A: Calgary dropping from the
playoff picture, and a team's willingness to send the Flames at
least a couple of good young players, prospects and/or draft
choices.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How great is the risk of trading for Fleury, then losing him
as a free agent after the season? A: A definite possibility and the
biggest reason for teams to exercise restraint when putting
together a package to send to the Flames for the scrappy winger,
who has said repeatedly he will not sign a contract until testing
the market after the season.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Is there a chance Calgary could trade Fleury, then re-sign him
this summer? A: Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Would Fleury put fans in the Staples Center? A: In the
short-term, yes. In the long-term, only if the Kings win
consistently.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could he provide the spark needed to lift the Kings into the
playoffs? A: Yes, but if that is something the Kings hope Fleury
will do, sooner is better than later. They have 33 games remaining.
By the March 23 trading deadline, the Kings will have 12 games left
and the addition of Fleury might be too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Kings were to acquire Fleury and miss this year's
playoffs, there would be a couple of benefits to such a deal. For
one thing, by acquiring Fleury the Kings would provide the
strongest indication to date that they are serious about spending
money to build a contending team. Fleury's contract probably will
pay him in the neighborhood of $7 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   For another, the team that owns Fleury's rights at season's end
will have the exclusive chance to negotiate with him until the
league-wide signing period begins on July 1, which is two days
after Fleury turns 31, the age at which players become eligible for
unrestricted free agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are far from the sole suitors for Fleury's services.
New Jersey, Buffalo, Toronto and San Jose all are expected to make
strong bids for Fleury. And the New York Rangers, smarting over
losing to Florida in the Pavel Bure sweepstakes, might pose the
most formidable opposition to the Kings in the Fleury bidding.
</P>
<P>
   To acquire Fleury, the Kings probably would be willing to trade
any of their prospects with the exception of center Olli Jokinen.
Also, the Kings are believed to want to keep the rights to
defenseman Aki Berg, who spent this season in Finland after failing
to reach contract terms with the Kings. Berg might have a future
with the Kings, even after this lost season.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the expected availability of Fleury represents
another opportunity for the Kings to add a high-profile player to
their lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Will this be the one that works out? A: Stay tuned.
</P>
<P>
   __ Lost opportunities:At least in the short-term, Bure has made
the Panthers look wise for acquiring him, scoring seven goals in
five games. But if the Kings were reluctant to deal for Bure, it
had nothing to do with his talents on the ice. A big concern was
the Russian Rocket's reported lifestyle away from the rink,
specifically his alleged associations with shady characters in
Moscow, which have been chronicled in several publications, most
recently the Toronto Globe &AMP; Mail.
</P>
<P>
   As for 23-year-old center Alexandre Daigle, the chronic bust was
traded last week to Tampa Bay by Philadelphia in a three-way deal
with Edmonton. According to a source in Philadelphia, the Kings
offered defenseman Steve Duchesne straight-up for Daigle, but the
Flyers declined. Kings general manager Dave Taylor denied the
report and it is highly debatable whether there would be any
benefit at this point to adding a player viewed as a project.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rinkside: Former NHL/Kings star Jari Kurri is doing color
commentary on Finnish television games and is involved in a sports
bar in Helsinki. Kurri, who attended last week's NHL All-Star Game
in Tampa, said he is interested in trying his hand at coaching. ``I
think I'd want to start (in Finland) first to see if I like it,''
he said. . . . Colorado was a beneficiary when Vancouver hired
former Avalanche coach Marc Crawford to replace the fired Mike
Keenan. Crawford had a year remaining on his contract when he
rejected Colorado's offer of a new two-year deal last May. He then
was replaced by Bob Hartley. In an arrangement brokered by NHL
Commissioner Gary Bettman, the Avalanche will receive a
second-round draft choice and $200,000 from Vancouver as
compensation for Crawford. If the Canucks finish in the NHL's top
12 (which is very doubtful), the Avalanche will get a first-round
pick. Vancouver would have to pay Colorado an additional $200,000
if they advance to the second round of the playoffs, and $200,000
more for a second-round triumph. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Nazarov, recently traded by Tampa Bay to Calgary for
Michael Nylander, disputes a recent article in The Hockey News that
labeled him the most dangerous player in hockey. ``No one called me
to my face (a) dirty player,'' Nazarov said. ``My opinion about me
is, when I play, I don't go and try to hurt people _ or try to kill
someone. I just try to play the game. Sometimes, things happen.
Sometimes, you hit somebody so hard, they get hurt. Sometimes, I
get hit so hard, I get hurt. This has happened, too.''

NEW JERSEY TAKES HARD LINE ON NEEDLE EXCHANGES
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Conn., Pa.)  (ms) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. _ Heroin addicts are, by definition,
creatures of habit, so it seemed odd that the bedraggled young man
who ambled up to the needle exchange in New Brunswick was uncertain
about what kind of syringe he would prefer.
</P>
<P>
   He closely examined several different types of needles. Finally,
he selected one, abruptly announced that he was an undercover agent
from the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office and arrested an AIDS
activist named Diana McCague for violating New Jersey's ban on
possessing or distributing syringes. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``I should have known right away he was a cop,'' said Ms.
McCague, who had been distributing clean needles to drug addicts
since 1994 and has been arrested twice. ``Users are very particular
about the kind of works they use _ they don't need to compare them.
He seemed a little too clean to be real, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCague's arrest, in the fall of 1998, forced her
organization, the Chai Project (chai is Hebrew for life), the last
of New Jersey's organized needle exchange programs, to stop
distributing syringes. Volunteers now set up their van twice each
week outside a soup kitchen in New Brunswick, distributing condoms,
HIV-prevention pamphlets and bleach kits to sterilize needles, but
no syringes.
</P>
<P>
   The needle-less campaign, and the unusually aggressive tactic of
using sting operations to snare advocates for AIDS victims, has
made New Jersey the most active front in the nation's fierce
political battle about the merit of needle exchanges. The state's
unrelenting opposition to the programs also places Gov.
Christie &UR;  &LR; Whitman in the uncharacteristic role of hard-liner.
</P>
<P>
   With her centrist views on social issues like abortion, gay
rights and gun control, the governor has carefully cultivated a
national reputation as a leader of the Republican Party's moderate
wing. But mention needle exchanges, and the fact that New Jersey
has the nation's third-highest rate of intravenous HIV infection,
and Whitman can grow heated.
</P>
<P>
   Republican governors in New York, Connecticut and Pennsylvania
use state money to pay for the programs, arguing that they save
lives and spare taxpayers the high cost of treating AIDS victims,
which can top $20,000 per patient per year. Whitman lauds the
county prosecutor who arrested Ms. McCague for ``enforcing the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National
Institutes of Health and the Surgeon General have all released
studies concluding that needle exchanges significantly decrease the
spread of HIV without increasing drug use. Whitman dismisses their
research as ``dubious, at best.''
</P>
<P>
   Her appointed attorney general, Peter G. Verniero, released a
study in 1998 that was critical of needle exchanges. The study
cited as one of its sources an article by the right-wing Heritage
Foundation, which also advocated conversion to Christianity as a
cure for drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
   And when Whitman was asked recently to explain the factual basis
for her unflinching belief that needle exchanges send the wrong
message to children, she grew frustrated, as if the hypocrisy of
the programs were so obvious it needed no explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a mother, I know that it sets a bad example,'' she said
during an interview last month. `` `Do as I say, not as I do' is a
lousy way to lead, whether you're running a family or running a
state.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight over needle exchanges began more than a decade ago,
and today 113 programs exist in 30 states, and exchange 17.5
million syringes annually, according to a CDC survey. About half
the programs operate legally, and 16 others are illegal, but
tolerated by their local governments. The rest operate underground.
</P>
<P>
   With a few notable exceptions, medical experts from the American
Medical Association to the National Academy of Sciences to the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services view needle exchanges as a
matter of public health and say that the goal of decreasing HIV
infection rates far outweighs the drawbacks of providing syringes
to drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
   But the needle exchanges involve such a morass of social and
moral issues that they have inspired bitter political brawls.
</P>
<P>
   But some law enforcement officials, led by Gen. Barry R.
McCaffrey, the White House director of drug policy, oppose the
programs as a matter of principle: Drugs are illegal, they
maintain, and government sends the wrong message to children by
providing addicts with the means to break the law.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton acknowledges that needle exchanges reduce HIV
infection without fostering drug use. But last year he gave in to
pressure from Republicans in Congress and prohibited the use of
federal money to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   In fighting the needle exchanges, Whitman has encountered an
unlikely adversary, David W. Troast, whom she chose in 1996 to head
the state's Advisory Commission on AIDS. As a wealthy businessman
and an acquaintance in Whitman's social circle, Troast was hardly
someone who would be expected to side with drug users and radicals.
</P>
<P>
   After taking the job, however, Troast interviewed dozens of
experts in public health, epidemiology and AIDS prevention, and was
stunned by the magnitude and severity of New Jersey's AIDS problem.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey has 26,000 people with AIDS, and the nation's highest
rate of HIV infection among women and children. The state also has
9,100 orphans whose mothers have died of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Troast said he was also struck by the overwhelming consensus
among health experts that any serious attempt to slow the spread of
HIV, which now infects 2,100 additional New Jersey residents each
year, must include a needle exchange program.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman rejected the commission's proposal, and when Troast
pushed the idea again several months later, she rejected it again.
As their wrangling became highly publicized, Troast began to notice
a pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever my council's actions got the attention of the media,
the authorities cracked down on Project Chai, and Diana McCague got
locked up,'' Troast said. ``I feel personally responsible for her
plight.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1998, Whitman wrote a letter telling the
commission that she would never change her opposition to needle
exchanges, and urging them to move on to more productive matters,
like developing strategies to cut the infection rates among
pregnant women and adolescents. Troast said the commission did
focus on those problems, but arrived at the same conclusion: that a
small needle exchange program could cut the state's number of new
HIV infections by as much as 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman insists that her position is a deeply held conviction,
based on common sense and firsthand experience with some of the
seriously impaired children born to drug-addicted mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Before her first run for governor in 1993, Whitman visited a
Newark hospital that treated children born addicted to cocaine, and
held some of the children who had been born with profound
developmental disabilities because of their mothers' drug use. The
experience convinced her that it would be better for society to
discourage drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that Whitman will not reverse her position, Ms.
McCague and other advocates are now concentrating on protests
calling for changes in the state's law after the governor's term
expires in 2001.

DARKLY COMIC ADVENTURE WINS NEWBERY MEDAL
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By EDEN ROSS LIPSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The 1999 Newbery Medal for children's literature
was announced on Monday for a darkly comic novel about a
schoolboy's mysterious adventure. The winning book, ``Holes,'' by
Louis Sachar (Frances Foster Books/Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux), is
about a boy named Stanley Yelnats who is convicted for a crime he
did not commit and serves time at Camp Green Lake, a bizarre
juvenile detention center in a dry Texas wasteland. The award is
given by the American Library Association.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Holes,'' which won the National Book Award for young
people's literature in November, was the popular and critical
favorite, it was an exceptionally strong year for both fiction and
nonfiction, and librarians and publishers expressed surprise that
only one honor book, or secondary award, was given, for ``A Long
Way from Chicago,'' a novel by Richard Peck (Dial Books for Young
Readers).
</P>
<P>
   There was something of a wintry theme on the picture book side.
The Caldecott Medal for illustration went to Mary Azarian, a
Vermont artist, for ``Snowflake Bentley'' (Houghton Mifflin), her
account of the life of Wilson Bentley, an early photographer of
snowflakes, illustrated with distinctive woodcuts.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the four honor books are also set in the cold: ``Snow''
written and illustrated by Uri Shulevitz (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux)
and ``Tibet Through the Red Box,'' written and illustrated by Peter
Sis (Frances Foster Books/Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux). The association
also cited Brian Pinkney for his illustrations for ``Duke
Ellington: The Piano Prince and His Orchestra'' by Andrea Davis
Pinkney (Hyperion Books for Children) and ``No David'' written and
illustrated by David Shannon (Blue Sky Press/Scholastic).
</P>
<P>
   In a separate development, the Young Adult Library Services
Association, a division of the American Library Association, has
agreed to the establishment of a separate award for the best young
adult book for readers ages 12 to 18 based on literary merit.
</P>
<P>
   As with the Newbery and Caldecott awards, the winner will be
announced at the midwinter meeting of the association. Only books
published by youth divisions or dedicated children's publishers
will be considered, not adult books with crossover appeal to
adolescents. Curiously a British middle-grade children's novel,
``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' is sitting firmly on the
adult best-seller list.
</P>
<P>
   Librarians have long championed fiction written especially for
adolescent readers, but publishers' interest has waxed and waned.
Now publishers and the entertainment business are showing renewed
interest in teen-agers' spending power and tastes with the success
of the magazine Teen People and movies like Adam Sandler's ``Water
Boy.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30th-anniversary Coretta Scott King awards were also
announced. The author award went to Angela Johnson for ``Heaven''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster) and the illustrator award to Michele Wood for
``I See the Rhythm'' (Children's Book Press.)

CLINTON TO PICK TEAM TO ASSESS CHINA'S ACQUISITION OF U.S.
TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Responding to a House committee's finding that
China stole sensitive American military technology over a period of
two decades, President Clinton will name a team of experts to
assess the damage and report back to Congress, an administration
official said on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take this issue very seriously, and we are organizing an
interagency team, including nuclear weapons and
counterintelligience experts,'' said David Leavy, a spokesman for
the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Leavy declined to say whether the president had determined that
the loss of sensitive data to China had, in fact, damaged national
security, the bedrock conclusion of the select House committee
headed by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official who has followed the issue closely
said on Monday night that there had been spirited debate within the
White House over whether there had been a threat to national
security. Leavy conceded that the decision to name a team of
experts to investigate the Chinese activities was a signal that the
damage might indeed have been very far reaching.
</P>
<P>
   Leavy said the damage-assessment team's findings would be
reviewed in turn by a panel of independent experts before they are
given to Congress. He said he could provide no details about who
would make up either the team or the outside panel or how the
members of each would be recruited.
</P>
<P>
   He said the work of the teams would be submitted to Congress
``in a timely fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of military and commercial deals with China has been
explosive in Washington for many months. In December, the Cox
committee, consisting of five Republicans and four Democrats,
concluded unanimously that China had obtained over the past 20
years some of the United States' most sensitive military
technology, including designs for nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Some information was obtained through theft, the committee
concluded, while other material was obtained by American
scientists' sharing knowledge with their Chinese counterparts
during satellite launchings involving both countries.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's findings, highly unusual in their bipartisan
nature, blamed Republican and Democratic administrations alike for
having allowed the security lapses to develop. It called China's
gleaning of American secrets a ``serious, sustained'' activity.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox committee began its inquiry last spring, after The New
York Times disclosed that American satellite makers had helped
Chinese scientists correct failures in their rocket programs and in
so doing had conveyed information applicable to long-range
ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The committee held 33 hearings, all closed, over six months. It
took testimony from intelligence officials, industry executives and
nuclear-weapons experts.
</P>
<P>
   Leavy said the White House agreed with the majority of the
committee's recommendations, which call among other things for
tighter controls on exports of technology and stiff penalties for
American companies that violate those controls.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Cox, the Republican members of the committee were Reps.
Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania, Porter J. Goss of Florida, James V.
Hansen of Utah and Doug Bereuter of Nebraska.The Democrats were
Norm Dicks of Washington, John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina,
Robert C. Scott of Virginia and Lucille Roybal-Allard of
California.
