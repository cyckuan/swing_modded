<HEADLINE> Local Cement Entrepreneurs Say No to New Factory in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Local owners of cement
industries in Bangladesh Saturday suggested the government not to
allow any more new cement factory in the country, saying it will
destroy the local industry.
</P>
<P>
"At present, cement production is exceeding the demand. The
manufacturers are driven to unhealthy competition and the quality
of cement has been hampered," Ahmed Akbar Sobhan, president of the
Bangladesh Cement Manufacturers Association said at a press
conference Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, the president said many cement
industries would turn sick and their owners become bank loan
defaulters if new investments are allowed in this sector.
</P>
<P>
The statement said in the year 2002, the country's 62 cement
factories would produce 16 million metric tons of cement and
another 2 million tons will be imported, but the market demand
would remain at only 5.5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The association predicted a sharp fall in cement price by 2002,
which would finally make the country's cement industries cripple.
</P>
<P>
They sought the intervention of the authorities to enable the
country's cement factories to survive, and urged the government to
discourage production in the sectors as they see a grim future
ahead due to excess production.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Fascist War Anniversary Observed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- People from all walks of life
here today attended a discussion marking the 55th anniversary of
the War of Resistance Against Japanese Invaders (1937-1945) and
the International Anti-Fascist War.
</P>
<P>
On the same day in 1945, a representative of the Japanese
Government signed a letter of surrender, symbolizing the final
victory of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Invaders and of
the anti-Fascist war.
</P>
<P>
During a six-week massacre after they entered into Nanjing, the
Japanese troops killed 300,000 innocent Chinese people. Many
participants of the discussion held that this was the cruelest
atrocity committed by Japanese soldiers in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
After the war, a handful of Japanese still insist upon
glorifying their militarism. In recent years, some right-wing
forces in Japan paid homage to Japanese soldiers that died during
the conflict at the Yasukuni Shrine, a bastion of the wartime
government-sponsored shintoism and symbol of militarism in Japan
before and during the World War Two. They also have modified
textbooks containing this period of history and held anti-China
rallies.
</P>
<P>
"We should bear in mind the history and prevent the recurrence
of this tragedy. We should speed up the process of modernization
of China and contribute more to world peace and stability," said a
participant attending the discussion.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Third Parliament Elections Since Civil War Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The second and final round of
the third parliament elections since Lebanon's civil war ended
Sunday evening after voters in Beirut, Bekaa and southern provinces
cast their ballot.
</P>
<P>
Polls closed at 6 p.m. (1500 GMT) when about 800,000 voters cast
their ballots. Some 1.4 million people of 2.5 million eligible
voters registered and got electoral cards.
</P>
<P>
The voters will choose 65 deputies from 259 candidates. In
Beirut, 19 deputies will be picked up. Twenty-three parliament
members will be chosen from the provinces of Bekaa Valley and South
each. The rest of the 128 parliament members have already been
chosen from the provinces of North and Mount in the first round
ballot last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
President Emile Lahoud urged the winners on Sunday to "work
together and save Lebanon from the current economic depression."
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Michel Murr said in a news conference Sunday
that the authority holds "a neutral position and democratic
freedom" in the election process and the ministry has not received
any report about security problems in the three provinces. At least
22,000 troops and policemen were positioned in and around the poll
stations.
</P>
<P>
There is also no complaint about the work of preparation and
logistics, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
The final result will be announced after two or three days.
</P>
<P>
The focal point of Sunday's elections remained in Beirut, where
former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri waged battles against
reigning Prime Minister Salim Hoss and conservative deputy Tammam
Salam.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the Beirut battle will have a crucial bearing on
the makeup of the post-election government, local political
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The Amal Movement, headed by Speaker Nabih Berri, made alliance
with Hezbollah in south Lebanon, where elections was held for the
first time since Israel's occupation in 1978.

<HEADLINE> Somali President Calls for Arab Assistance to Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Somalia's new president,
Abdiqasim Salad Hassan, on Sunday called on the Arab states to
provide assistance to his country's reconstruction process.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the opening ceremony of the two-day 114th Arab
League Foreign Ministers Council, Salad said Somalia is facing
formidable tasks, starting with rebuilding the infrastructures,
ravaged during the long-standing civil war.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of reconstruction process for not
only Somalia itself but also the whole Arab world as the collapse
of the Somali state had caused "a dangerous security vacuum" in the
Arab region.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has been in anarchy since 1991 when former president
Mohammed Siad Barre was toppled. A reconciliation conference hosted
by Djibouti formed a transitional parliament on August 13, which
elected Salad to the presidency on August 25. Both the parliament
and the president are the first in a decade in the Horn of Africa
country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters later, Salad said his top priority is to
create a government by first appointing a prime minister.
</P>
<P>
After that, the government will start collecting weapons from
the numerous militia groups, he said.
</P>
<P>
Salad, who arrived here Saturday on his first international tour
since his election, will move on from Cairo to New York Tuesday to
attend the United Nations General Assembly.

<HEADLINE> French Firm Contracted to Keep Alexandria Clean Over 15 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Alexandria signed on Sunday with
Onyx, an offshoot of French conglomerate Vivendi, a contract worth
500 million euro (450 million U.S. dollars) to keep the Egyptian
Mediterranean city clean over the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The deal to handle 1 million tons of garbage a year produced
by the city of 3.5 million residents was a departure from
traditional methods, Henri Troglio, the boss of Onyx's parent,
Vivendi Environnement, said after he inked the contract with
Alexandria Governor Mohamed Abdel Salam al Mahgoub, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Onyx will collect household, business, medical and non-toxic
industrial waste, clean urban areas and beaches, operate three
sorting and disposal plants, close three tips and open a new one,
and build and operate an incinerator.
</P>
<P>
Company heads said the contract, one of the largest signed by
Onyx in terms of the population to be served, was an important step
in developing Vivendi Environnement's activities in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
The group also specializes in water management, energy and
transport.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Prime Minister Atef Obeid, who attended the signing
ceremony, said that negotiations are underway with environment
firms to clean cities in 11 of Egypt's 26 governorates.
</P>
<P>
Some of the contracts are expected to be signed by the end of
the year, Obeid added.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Refutes Iranian Allegations Over Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraq rejects all the
allegations made by Iran over the recent riots in an Iranian city,
an Iraqi foreign ministry said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the spokesman said it is proofless for Iran to
claim that Iraq was behind the riots in the western city of
Khoramabad, capital of Iran's Lorestan Province.
</P>
<P>
The riots, which broke out on August 26 after two leading
intellectuals were blocked from entering the city to address a
nationwide conference, have left one policeman dead and many others
injured. The riots touched off days of violence between supporters
of the pro-reform group and Iran's conservative radicals.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has nothing to do with the unrest, which is completely
Iran's internal affairs, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Iranian authorities have issued a decree to probe the unrest and
reveal the "behind-the-scene factors" in the violent incident.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokesman accused Iran of supporting Iraq's
opposition groups both "politically and financially."
</P>
<P>
For years, Iraq and Iran have been trading accusations for
harboring each other's opposition groups engaged in terrorist
activities. The dispute has been a major obstacle to the
normalization of bilateral ties, which remain tense more than 10
years after the 1980-1988 bloody war.
</P>
<P>
The war ended with a United Nations-brokered ceasefire in 1988,
but the two neighbors have never signed a peace treaty.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Want Implementation of Signed Agreements: Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
said here Sunday that the Palestinian side did not ask the
impossible from Israel but only the proper implementation of all
signed agreements between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the remark in response to the urge of Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak that the Palestinians should show flexibility
in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was speaking after his return form the Egyptian capital
of Cairo, where he took part in the Arab League foreign ministers'
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Terming the meeting as significant, Arafat said the Arab foreign
ministers supported the Palestinian rights.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Arab foreign ministers' meeting early on Sunday,
Arafat said there would be no peace without the declaration of an
independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who is going to New York to take part in the United
Nations Millennium Summit, said his government would not accept any
peace step unless Arafat showed more flexibility.
</P>
<P>
United States President Bill Clinton is expected to meet Barak
and Arafat, who is also going to attend the U.N. event, separately
in New York on September 6 on the sidelines of the U.N. summit in
another bid to reach an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the gap is still wide between the two parties on the final-
status issues, particularly the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. suggestion to share control over Old Jerusalem was turned
down by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Maguid said, "The holy
city of Jerusalem is a Palestinian Arab, Muslim and Christian city
and the heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Control over Jerusalem
should not be shared by the Palestinians and Israel."
</P>
<P>
It was also announced during the meeting that an Arab summit
will be held in Cairo early 2001. This summit will be the first of
its kind since 1996.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-Palestinian Summit Crucial for Peace Process: Arafat's Adviser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
adviser Nabil Abu-Rudienah described here on Sunday the coming
summit between Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton, to be held
on September 6 on the sidelines of the United Nations Millennium
Summit, as decisive for the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting will be an important occasion for reviewing the
overall situation and a crucial turning point to either
constructive ideas on the peace process or the whirlwind of the new
negative Israeli policy that could be imposed on the region," Abu-
Rudienah told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians urge for a more effective U.S. role and a more
serious Israeli attitude towards the peace talks, he said.
</P>
<P>
The coming few days will test Israel's seriousness and the
effectiveness of the United States administration in pressuring
Israel to respect the signed accords, he added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will address the opening session of the millennium summit
to identify the guidelines of the Palestinian position on Mideast
peace in the coming period and assert the Palestinians' right to
declare statehood, Abu-Rudienah said.
</P>
<P>
Abu-Rudienah said Arafat will also meet a score of world leaders
in New York, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, on the sidelines of the U.N. summit.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Tired, old looking and worn and faded textiles appear
to be popular nowadays in the European carpet market.
</P>
<P>
This trend is a stark contrast to the medieval, 16th to 19th
century European taste for genuine, brightly colored and patterned
Islamic woven textiles.
</P>
<P>
As bright, spirited colors are no longer required for the
European market and carpets are usually woven in bright colors,
they pose a selling problem.
</P>
<P>
Such a phenomenon is a reflection of the tiredness, loss of
innocence, of vitality and of the barrenness of European taste
although there are other possible explanations.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran's Majlis (parliament) passed a bill on Sunday to
exempt non-oil exports from duties.
</P>
<P>
The bill is intended to remedy the country's floundering economy
and over-dependence on volatile oil income.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago the Majlis also passed almost unanimously a draft
bill that would encourage as well as protect foreign investment,
desperately sought by the country as a key to raising production
and solving unemployment.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey has increased its exports to Russia by 15
percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Union of Chambers and Commodities Exchanges and the
Exporters Council plan to set up a "Turkish Trade Center" in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Russian and Turkish businessmen met over the weekend at the
Chamber of Commerce in Izmir, southwestern Turkey, to discuss ways
to promote the bilateral trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Russian officials said Russia holds interest in Turkish leather,
metal and food sectors, and that they expect the trade volume
between Russia and Turkey to reach 3.3 billion U.S. dollars this
year.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish import of crude oil reduced by 3 percent
in 1999 to 22.9 million tons from 23.7 million tons in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Out of the total imports last year, 4.77 million tons of oil
were imported from Iraq, 4.75 million from Iran and 3.6 million
from Libya.
</P>
<P>
The costs of oil imports increased by 34.2 percent from 2.4
billion dollars to 2.7 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
The domestic production of crude oil dropped to 2.9 million tons
in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Omani Minister Terms Peace With Israel as Arab Strategic Option </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Omani Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs Yousef Bin Alawi Bin Abdullah said Sunday that
Arabs have chosen "just and comprehensive" peace with Israel as a
strategic option.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the inaugural session of the Arab League
Foreign Ministers Council, Bin Alawi stressed that such a peace
should lead to the establishment of an independent Palestinian
state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
The peace should also secure the return of the Golan Heights
that Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War through the
implementation of U.N. Security Council resolutions 242 and 338, he
said.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day session, the Arab foreign ministers will
focus their discussions on the Middle East peace process,
especially the issue of Jerusalem, which lies at the heart of the
Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Peace will not be guaranteed in the Middle East if Israel has
full control over Jerusalem and the Palestinian national right to
East Jerusalem which was also occupied by Israel in the 1967
Mideast war are not secured, the Omani official said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their
future independent state.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Mideast peace process and Jerusalem, the Arab
ministers are also due to discuss other issues related to the Arab
world, including international trade sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries must work to end the tragedy suffered by Iraq and
its people as soon as possible, Bin Alawi told his Arab
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the "deep wounds" caused by Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait, Arab countries still "have the responsibility" to exert
efforts to find a solution to the "tragic situation" of the Iraqi
people, he said.
</P>
<P>
He described the Iraqi crisis as "an Arab-Arab crisis," which "
the U.N. Security Council has been unable to solve."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. economic sanctions since its invasion
of Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Ministers of Trade, Transport to Visit Iraq on Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A senior Jordanian delegation
headed by Minister of Trade and Industry Wasif Azar is expected to
visit Iraq on Monday to discuss ways of boosting trade ties between

the two countries, Jordanian officials announced on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Azar and his delegation, which also includes Minister of
Transport Mohammad Kalaldeh, will meet Iraqi Minister of Trade
Mohammad Mehdi Salah and other senior Iraqi officials during the
four-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Iraq, the most important trade partner of Jordan,
has exported to Jordan various products valued at some 206 million
U.S. dollars in the first half of this year, which accounted for 67
percent of Jordan's total imports, said Jordan's official
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, the only source of crude oil for Jordan, provides the
kingdom with 50,000 to 750,000 barrels per day at a preference
price
of 19 dollars per barrel, which is much lower than the
international market prices.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been trying to strike a diplomatic balance between
Iraq and Iraq's arch Arab foes Kuwait during the 1990 Gulf crisis,
which was triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Jordan had been isolated by Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other
Arab countries for its sympathy with Iraq during the Gulf crisis.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming Jordan-Iraq talks in Baghdad will also cover Iraq's
imports via Jordan's red sea harbor Aqaba, which declined
drastically during the first seven months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, which used to import most of its commodities through
Aqaba, imported only 28,482 tons in the first seventh months of
this year compared to 6.8 million tons in 1998, Jordanian officials
said. Baghdad is reportedly unhappy with a lack of support for
the
Iraqi government from Amman despite Jordan's constant calls for an
end to the sufferings of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two Arab neighbors have witnessed a major
improvement since the July visit to Amman by Iraqi Vice President
Taha Yassin Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein held talks with Ramadan. It
was the first time for him to to meet a senior Iraqi official since
he assumed the throne in February last year.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Prime Minister Ali Abu Ragheb, who took office on June
19, has pledged to forge closer ties with Iraq and help end the U.
N. sanctions imposed on Baghdad since its invasion of Kuwait in
1990.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: U.S. Peace Envoy Ends Mideast Shuttle Diplomacy Qi Deliang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special Middle East
peace envoy Dennis Ross returned to Washington Saturday night after
winding up his two-week mediation between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the visit was to study the grounds for
another Camp David summit and persuade both Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to soften their
positions on key issues such as Jerusalem so that they could reach
a peace accord on the Israeli-Palestinian final status soon.
</P>
<P>
Ross, during his shuttle diplomacy which started on August 16,
held several rounds of talks with Barak and Arafat and other
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators to this end.
</P>
<P>
He also traveled twice to Egypt to discuss these issues with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, a major peace promoter in the
region, and asked for help from the the Egyptian leader.
</P>
<P>
Although Ross refused to disclose any details about his talks,
he had reportedly spent a lot of time with the two sides on the
Jerusalem issue, which was the main reason for the failure of the
Camp David summit held in July between Arafat, Barak under the host
of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Control of the Temple Mount in East Jerusalem, on which the Al-
Aqsa Mosque (Islam's third holiest site) and the Wailing Wall
(Jewish holy site) are located, is at the core of the dispute in
the Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks. Both Barak and Arafat
refused to give up sovereignty over their holy sites.
</P>
<P>
Ross, by the end of August, brought to the two sides a new U.S.
proposal for resolving the sovereignty over the Temple Mount.
</P>
<P>
In the proposal, the U.S. suggested to divide the Temple Mount
area into four sections, each containing a different mix of powers
for the two sides. The four sections would be the Islamic holy
site, the Temple Mount Plaza, the external wall and the sub-terrace
spaces.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether the proposal can be accepted by the two
sides, but it is certain that further discussions will be held in
the coming days when Barak and Arafat hold separate talks with
President Clinton in the United States.
</P>
<P>
If it turns out that the dispute over the Temple Mount and the
Old City in East Jerusalem can not be resolved, Israel is
reportedly ready for a mutually-agreed postponement on the
Jerusalem issue for five years, during which the status quo will
remain in effect.
</P>
<P>
In that case, however, the Palestinian side will not accede to
Israel's demand to declare "the end of the conflict." Israel
proposed stating in the agreement, if reached, that the 52-year-old
Israeli-Palestinian conflict has ended while both sides still have
conflicting claims over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Ross concluded his mediation by saying that "the two sides have
come a long way...and obviously there are still differences." He
also said that he will report to Clinton about the outcome of his
mission and let the president decide when to call another Camp
David-style summit.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Israeli Prime Minister's Office repeatedly
accused Arafat of demonstrating no flexibility since Camp David,
while the Palestinian side says that Israel needs to compromise on
all the key issues, particularly the issue of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Next week, Clinton will meet separately in New York, on the
sidelines of the United Nations Millennium Summit, with Barak and
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The New York meetings will be decisive as to how Clinton, who is
leaving office by the year end, will further help push the Israeli-
Palestinian final-status talks forward.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Parliamentarians Propose Amnesty to Political Exiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Some 40 Iranian Majlis
(parliament) members on Sunday proposed a draft bill to grant
amnesty to those who escaped from the country because of their
affiliations to outlawed political parties.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft, all exiled members of outlawed political
groups would be granted amnesty except for those who took up arms
and conduct terrorist operations against Iran, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the draft said they sponsored the amnesty to mark
the Imam Ali Year, designated by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei in the advent of the current Iranian year, 1379 (started
March 2000).
</P>
<P>
They urged the Majlis to pass the bill and enforce the law not
later than the end of the current Iranian year. But the report did
not say when the bill is to be discussed in the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
The amnesty will certainly exclude members of the Iraq-based
Iranian military opposition Mujaheddin Khalq Organization (MKO),
which was outlawed in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Labeled by Iran as a "terrorist group," the MKO has launched
numerous cross-border attacks inside Iran in recent years,
including assassinating senior Iranian officials.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Crisis Worsens in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 3 (Xinhua) -- An acute shortage of fuel
persists in Zimbabwe despite the government assurances that the
problem will end soon.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has been facing shortages of petrol, diesel and
paraffin since November last year, largely due to the shortage of
foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
A survey by the Zimbabwe News Agency on Sunday showed the most
service stations in Harare, the country's capital, were dry.
</P>
<P>
In Bulawayo, the second largest city in Zimbabwe, service
stations completely ran out of petrol and diesel supplies on
Sunday, as the fuel crisis in the city continued to worsen, the
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"I have been sleeping in the queue since Friday, but nothing
has come yet," one motorist queuing in the city center told the
agency.
</P>
<P>
"How can they increase the price of fuel by over 40 percent,
yet the commodity is not available. Something is terribly wrong
with our government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Although the National Oil Company of Zimbabwe increased the
price of fuel by 41 to 101 percent with effect from Thursday night,
the commodity is still unavailable on the market.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: U.N. Summit to Hammer Out Strategies to Meet Challenges in New Century (by Gu Zhenqiu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is
scheduled to open the Millennium Summit here Wednesday in what
will turn out to be a historic occasion for the 188 member states
to address the challenges of the new century.
</P>
<P>
Momentum is building for the three-day event, which is expected
to be the largest-ever gathering of heads of state or government
in the history of the world body, with more than 150 heads of
state or government indicating their intentions to take part in
the September 6-8 forum to focus on the role of the United Nations
in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that it is essential
that the Millennium Summit should provide an opportunity for a "
moral commitment" to the principles of the U.N. Charter and new
political momentum for global cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who has promoted the meeting as the most important in
the 55 years since the establishment of the United Nations, said
in his report, "The new millennium, and the Millennium Summit,
offer the world's peoples a unique occasion to reflect on their
common destiny, at a moment when they find themselves
interconnected as never before."
</P>
<P>
The summit will be convened in the face of the complex and
volatile international situation, and the world has witnessed the
disgraceful hostage-taking of U.N. peacekeepers by Sierra Leonean
rebels, the marginalization of the United Nations in the
maintenance of world peace and security, and the "human rights
over sovereignty" and "neo-interventionist" fallacies.
</P>
<P>
The decision to hold the summit stems from the conviction that
the turn of the century presents "a unique and symbolically
compelling moment to articulate and affirm an animating vision for
the United Nations in the new era," in words of the December 1998
resolution of the United Nations General Assembly, which
designated its 55th session as the Millennium Assembly, with the
Millennium Summit taking place at its outset.
</P>
<P>
In addition to making formal speeches at the summit, the heads
of state or government will have the opportunity to participate in
one of four interactive round tables, each to be chaired by a head
of state or government nominated from a different region.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state or government have also been invited by Annan to
take the opportunity of the summit to sign or deposit instruments
of ratification for multilateral treaties they may not yet have
joined, especially 25 core treaties representing key U.N.
objectives. Those treaties range from human rights, as well as
civil and political rights to the destruction of anti-personnel
landmines.
</P>
<P>
Under the summit's overarching theme of "the Role of the United
Nations in the 21st Century," member states have agreed to discuss
four specific themes during the three-day summit: poverty and
development, conflict prevention, environmental problems, and
strengthening the role of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, world leaders are also expected to focus their
attention on the reform of the U.N. and the Security Council, the
negative impact of globalization on the developing world, the
upholding of the Security Council authority in the maintenance of
international peace and security, U.N. back dues, HIV/AIDS, U.N.
peacekeeping operations, the information technology, disarmament
and human rights.
</P>
<P>
All these problems are posing grave challenges to the United
Nations, which, under the charter, has the primary responsibility
for the maintenance of international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The Millennium Summit will be the first summit to be attended
by the leaders of all U.N. member countries since October 1995,
when the international organization held a special meeting to
celebrate the 50th anniversary of its establishment.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has unanimously chosen the presidents of
Namibia and Finland to be the joint chairmen of the upcoming
Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state or government of the 15 members of the Security
Council, will hold a summit on September 7 to discuss the U.N.
peacekeeping operations in the world, in Africa in particular. The
council has met only once at summit level, on January 31, 1992, a
few weeks after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, founded in 1945 after World War II by 50
countries for the purpose of saving "succeeding generations from
the scourge of war," has neither achieved nor been equipped for
attaining that high ideal.
</P>
<P>
With 188 members, the United Nations is overwhelmed by demands
and crises, and has undergone numerous reforms. The declaration
the heads of state or government will adopt on September 8 points
to various areas that have made world headlines: globalization,
management of the world economy, peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The declaration deals with basic human freedoms: freedom to
live and raise children in dignity, and freedom from hunger, from
fear and violence, oppression or injustice. It calls for equality
among nations and individuals, tolerance and respect for nature.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state or government are also expected to hammer
out strategies to carry out programs by specific target dates: the
halving by 2015 the current 22 percent of the world's population
living on less than one U.S. dollar a day; halving the current 20
percent of people without drinking water; and giving equal access
to boys and girls to all levels of education. By 2020, programs to
improve the lives of 100 million slum dwellers should be
implemented in developing and transitional countries.
</P>
<P>
The world, the developing nations in particular, always turns
its eyes to the United Nations at the time of crisis and for the
establishment of a fair and just international political and
economic order, but the world body is currently deep in the
financial crisis largely due to the U.S. reluctance to pay its
back dues in full, on time and without any condition.
</P>
<P>
In fact, however ambitious a program is, the non-profit-making
United Nations, as always, needs unequivocal political will and
generous financial support from member states, especially the rich
Western countries, to carry out what has been agreed upon by the
international community. Otherwise, the most universal body will
simply let the world community down.

<HEADLINE> S. African Olympic Team Bound for Sydney with High Hopes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The South African Olympic
team will leave for Sydney on Sunday night with high hopes of
bettering the nation's medal tally of five from the 1996 Atlanta
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping for eight medals, anything else will be a bonus
for us," enthused President of the National Olympic Committee of
South Africa (NOCSA) Sam Ramsamy before the team's departure.
</P>
<P>
In response to the president's comment, the South African
Olympic squad's upbeat mood seemed to grant Ramsamy his wish.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 athletes, out of a total squad of 129, on Saturday
night gathered at the squad's holding camp at Esselen Park outside
Johannesburg to take care of last-minute arrangements and the
atmosphere was electric.
</P>
<P>
According to Ramsamy, South Africa's medal winners four years
ago at Atlanta Olympic Games were Penny Heyns, Josia Thugwane,
HezekielSepeng and Marianne Kriel.
</P>
<P>
However, Kriel, who won bronze in the backstroke, has now
retired.
</P>
<P>
It will be remembered that Heyns won gold in the 100m and 200m
breaststroke, setting world records in the process; Sepeng became
South Africa's first Black Olympic medalist when finishing a close
second in the 800m track event; and Thugwane won the closest
Olympic marathon in history to become the nation's first non-White
gold medalist.
</P>
<P>
But what prospects do the Millenium Olympics in Sydney from
September 15 to October 1 hold for the Rainbow Nation?
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the likely medal contenders are Heyns in both the 100m
and 200m breaststroke; Brendon Dedekind in the 50m freestyle;
RykNeethling in the distance freestyle; Llewellyn Herbert in the
400m hurdles; Sepeng in the 800m track event; Hestrie Cloete in
the women's high jump; the men's 400m track relay team and Frantz
Kruger in discus.
</P>
<P>
Then the fringe contenders are Elana Meyer, the 10,000m silver
medalist at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics; Thugwane and Colleen de
Reackin the marathon; the under-23 soccer tournament; the women's
hockey team, ranked sixth in the world; the tennis team, where the
best hopes lie with the world's fifth-ranked men's doubles
combination of David Adams and John laffnie de Jager; and rowing,
where women's light-weight pair appear the best equipped to reach
a final.
</P>
<P>
But then there is also the omnipresent pressure of the Olympic
Games, injury, illness, stage-fright and the plain old bad day at
the office to contend with.
</P>
<P>
Realistically then, anything more than five medals will be a
bonus for the South African Olympic squad.
</P>
<P>
As someone once said, competing at the Olympics is not all
about winning, but the joy of taking part, going faster, further
or higher than ever before will be a triumph in itself for most of
the South Africans in Sydney.

Fermin Cacho announced on Sunday that he would not compete at the
Sydney Olympic Games because he is suffering from tendinitis.

<HEADLINE> Overhaul of China's Futures Market Effective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The overhaul of China's
futures market has proved effective with trading of major futures
items witnessing upward trend.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that in the first seven months of the year,
the transaction value of bronze futures increased to 287.2 billion
yuan, up 49.71 percent than that of the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the trading of soybean futures rose 22 percent
year on year to 72.8 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts said that increased trading volume showed that
China's futures market had, on the whole, embarked on a new road
of steady growth.
</P>
<P>
At present, the country has three futures exchanges, which are
based in China's largest commercial center of Shanghai, the
northeast coastal city of Dalian and the central China city of
Zhengzhou.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai futures exchange integrates the operations of the
former metals, commodities, grain and oil futures exchanges, while
the other two futures trading centers specialize in soybean
trading, and red bean and green bean trading, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Before the overhaul of the futures market, China had 14 futures
trading centers.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Court Again Postpones Verdict on Brotherhood Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's High Military Court on
Sunday deferred for the second time the announcement of sentences
on 20 Muslim Brotherhood members charged with reactivating the
banned movement.
</P>
<P>
The court at the Huckstep military base, 30 kilometers north of
Cairo, was due to pass verdict on Sunday but postponed the hearings
until November 7 without giving reasons, the country's Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The defendants, including two university professors and a former
legislator, have been in jail since their arrest last October which
marked the biggest crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood in four
years.
</P>
<P>
They are accused of damaging social peace, belonging to an
illegal organization, trying to gain control of professional
unions, obstructing the constitution and instigating anti-
government propaganda.
</P>
<P>
The trial began on December 25 and a verdict had been expected
July 30 before the first deferral.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim Brotherhood was banned in the 1950s, but is partly
tolerated by the government, as it says publicly it is seeking to
establish an Islamic state through peaceful means.

<HEADLINE> Former President Files Writ Against Scrapping of Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi former President and
Jatiya Party Chairman H.M. Ershad Sunday filed a writ petition
with the High Court, challenging a notification of the Parliament
Secretariat which vacated his parliament membership following
conviction in a corruption case.
</P>
<P>
The writ petition that challenged the notification for
cancellation of Ershad's parliament membership, was issued on
August 30 under the signature of Mohammad Muktadir Chowdhury,
additional secretary of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
In his petition, Ershad termed the cancellation of his
parliament membership as illegal, saying nobody has the right to
cancel his parliament membership.
</P>
<P>
The writ petition challenged the authority of issuing the
notification which was signed by the additional secretary of the
parliament, who is not permitted by the law to issue such sort of
notification while the speaker was outside the country.
</P>
<P>
Further contention of the writ petition is that the issue of
notification of canceling Ershad's parliament membership is in
violation of the provision of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
It was also contended in the petition that there had been a
serious violation of Ershad's fundamental right on the question of
principles of natural justice without hearing Ershad or notifying
him before declaration of the cancellation of his parliament
membership.
</P>
<P>
The Parliament Secretariat on August 30 canceled the parliament
membership of Ershad as the High Court, upholding the verdict of a
lower court with certain modifications, sentenced the former
president to five years' imprisonment on a corruption Case.
</P>
<P>
"As per Article 66 (2) of the Constitution, Ershad is no longer
qualified to remain a member of Parliament following his
conviction by the High Court," the notification said.

WASHINGTON, September3(Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Al Gore and George W. Bush begin the final stage of the
presidential campaign this weekend in the closest rate the country
has seen in two decades, with Bush on the defensive for the first
time in six months, struggling to reverse the gains Gore made at
his convention last month.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton on Saturday called on Congress
to give workers a one-dollar raise in the minimum wage and on New
Yorkers to elect his wife to the Senate. September 4 is the
nation's Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton's decision not to authorize even initial
construction of a national missile shield had been shaped by
events as far back as January, senior administration and Pentagon
officials said, when the Russians first made it clear they would
not negotiate changes in the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972.
</P>
<P>
-- Labor Day is the unofficial opening of the general election
campaign, but for most voters the race is already over.
Strategists on both sides agree that more than 90 percent of the
electorate has by now settled on either George W. bush or Vice
President Al Gore.

<HEADLINE> Building Efficient Government with Information Technology: Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji has
called on governments at all levels to vigorously promote the use
of advanced information technologies in the building up of a clean
and highly efficient government.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, also member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, made the
call at a science and technology lecture held here recently by the
science and technology leading group of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
At the lecture, officials from the General Administration of
Customs and the State Administration of Taxation reported on the
operation of their electronic systems -- part of the country's "
golden customs" and "golden tax" projects.
</P>
<P>
The premier spoke highly of the projects, noting that the
projects will be of much help in preventing and cracking down on
economic crimes such as smuggling, and tax and exports rebate
frauds.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China put a lot of efforts in the anti-smuggling
campaign and achieved huge successes. A total of 80 billion yuan
worth of smuggled goods were uncovered, and the customs tariff
increased by 71 billion yuan as a result.
</P>
<P>
Without efforts to continue improving the "golden customs"
project, large-scale smuggling may run rampant again, the premier
warned.
</P>
<P>
Currently, he said, a new task for the government is to
resolutely strike against the cheats of exports rebates. China
raised the rate of export rebates in the second half of last year,
which helped increase exports by 38.3 percent in the first half of
the year, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The premier noted that without advanced technological means and
modern information technology, China could not have succeeded in
dealing with economic crimes and safeguarding economic order and
the interests of the country.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels should speed up and improve the
construction of the "golden customs" and "golden tax" projects,
the premier said.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Zhu also highlighted the importance of computer
networks of various departments in the reforms and management of
governments.
</P>
<P>
It is an urgent job to improve professional and technological
training for government workers, the premier said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Barak Heads to New York to Seek Peace Breakthrough by Lou Jian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak is to leave for New York Sunday night to attend the upcoming
U.N. Millennium Summit, trying to determine the fate of the
Israeli-Palestinian talks there.
</P>
<P>
The summit, a gathering of 159 of the world's leaders, is slated
for September 6-8. Barak plans to meet with U.S. President Bill
Clinton on the sidelines of the summit, and Clinton will meet
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat separately. The meetings will be
the first since the three convened a peace summit at Camp David in
July.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-sponsored Camp David talks lasted 15 days, but failed
to reach any agreement due to significant gaps between Israel and
the Palestinians over the fate of Jerusalem and the return of
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Barak's office had repeatedly denied in recent days that there
are any plans for another summit between the three in New York,
highlighting the frustration and gloominess felt by Israelis toward
the stagnant peace process.
</P>
<P>
Since the collapse of the Camp David talks, there were lower-
level negotiations between Israeli acting Foreign Minister Shlomo
Ben-Ami and Palestinian negotiators Saeb Erekat and Mohammed
Dahlan. However, there were no reports about significant progress
on the core issues, especially on the future status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Mideast special envoy Dennis Ross, meanwhile, had left the
region empty-handed Saturday night after a two-week peace
exploration. And Egyptian officials had raised new ideas for a
solution of the sovereignty of East Jerusalem, Old City and Temple
Mount. Nevertheless, no proposals could be accepted by the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, Barak had repeatedly accused Arafat of
showing no flexibility and openness in the talks, and claimed that
the ball now is in the Palestinian court.
</P>
<P>
Finger-pointing does not help the peace process, analysts
believed. The Palestinians, meanwhile, insisted that Israel should
be the side that makes further compromises in future talks.
</P>
<P>
Other warning signals showed that Barak, who lost his
parliamentary majority ahead of the Camp David talks, may begin
preparations for an early election in case that the talks ended
without an agreement.
</P>
<P>
On August 14, Barak's Finance Minister Avraham Shochat announced
that purchase taxes on 630 products will be abolished or
dramatically lowered.
</P>
<P>
A week later, Barak made another dramatic announcement about a
package of civil reform proposals, in which he will deliver a
constitution within a year, approve civil marriages, call for
national military service for all and cancel the Religious Affairs
Ministry. These moves were obviously aimed at attracting votes from
secular Israelis in the next election.
</P>
<P>
Barak also reached out to right-wing Likud party to explore the
possibility to form a so-called "broad-based" coalition. But as
officials in Jerusalem claimed, such a socioeconomic-oriented
coalition might shelve the Israeli-Palestinian talks at least for a
while.
</P>
<P>
In this context, the summit meeting between Barak and Arafat in
New York could be the last chance for the two sides to bridge gaps
and renew their talks. With control over only 40 seats in the 120-
member Knesset (parliament), Barak will surely face great pressure
from rightist elements in the parliament once the Knesset
reconvened at the end of October after the summer recess.
</P>
<P>
Although recent signals showed that the Palestinians may
postpone the target date for declaration of statehood from
September 13 to November 15, the question is whether Barak is able
to sustain for so long.
</P>
<P>
Some right-wing parties have launched a drive to prevent Barak
from signing any agreement without a parliamentary majority and
grassroots protesters demonstrating outside the Prime Minister's
Office Sunday morning already claimed Barak no longer has the
mandate from the people.

At moments, the demonstrators, whose emotions ran high, scuffled
with the police. Two policemen were injured.
</P>
<P>
Deri arrived at the prison late in the afternoon and met there
with Shas spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef.
</P>
<P>
As the first former cabinet minister ever sentenced to prison
terms in the country, Deri is required to report to the prison
authority Sunday noon after having exhausted appeals process since
the sentence.
</P>
<P>
In a low-key address to an estimated 10,000 supporters outside
the prison, Rabbi Yosef vowed that Shas would survive despite Aryeh
Deri's incarceration.
</P>
<P>
Yosef called for restraint on the part of the crowd and urged
them to get more Jews to study the Torah.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the crowd of supporters, Deri said: "I am going
behind these walls with a happy heart. I accept the Lord's decision
with a happy heart."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Deri, a father of nine children, declared that he will
not seek a presidential pardon. But his wife, Yaffa, is expected to
go to the presidential residence Beit Hanassi to ask President
Moshe Katsav to pardon her husband. Reports here said she would
bring her children with her to plead for the pardon.
</P>
<P>
Deri's nine-year-old daughter, Hadas, appeared at a mass rally
for him last week and succeeded in bringing tears to the eyes of
Deri's supporters.
</P>
<P>
President Katsav has urged Shas supporters to exercise restraint
and act properly. He also called for respect for the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
In a counter-rally against Shas supporters, representatives of
youth movements are holding a vigil outside the Supreme Court in
Jerusalem to air support for the arms of law and order.
</P>
<P>
Deri, 41, once a charismatic and promising political star and
the state's youngest ever interior minister, was convicted on
charges of bribery taking, breach of trust and fraud while he
served as the minister in the 1980s, and was sentenced to three
years in prison later.

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM Briefs Cabinet on His Forthcoming U.S. Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak Sunday briefed his ministers on his expected trip to the U.S.
for the United Nations' millennium summit, saying that he saw no
sign of flexibility from the Palestinian side ahead of his trip.
</P>
<P>
At Sunday morning's weekly cabinet meeting, Barak said that
during the summit due to take place on September 6-8, he will meet
more than 30 world leaders, including United States President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will also meet Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who is
also scheduled to fly to New York for the summit. These meetings
are widely regarded as the last chance to revive the Israeli-
Palestinian talks.
</P>
<P>
The two-way meetings are the first since July's Camp David
talks, which failed to reach any Israeli-Palestinian agreement due
to significant gaps between the two sides over the fate of
Jerusalem and the return of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Barak said Sunday that during the upcoming week he will see if
the Palestinians are receptive to the ideas raised by Clinton at
the Camp David summit and/or similar ideas which have been raised
recently by other countries, according to a statement issued by
Barak's office.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister stressed that up until now he has not seen
any sign of flexibility or openness on the Palestinians' part that
could indicate the possibility of resuming the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He added that he is now waiting for a decision by Arafat and it
would not be correct on Israel's part to do anything at this stage
but wait.
</P>
<P>
Barak reiterated that neither a three-way meeting similar to the
Camp David summit, between him, Arafat and Clinton, nor a two-way
meeting with Arafat has been set so far.
</P>
<P>
Barak's office had denied such rumors several times in the past
few days.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Vows to Continue Battling for Sovereignty Over East Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
vowed on Sunday that the Palestinian people will "continue to
battle for sovereignty over Jerusalem," making it the capital of
their future independent state.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem is "in danger" due to Israel's illegal practices to
judaize the holy city and its attempts to impose such solutions on
the Palestinians, which will fail to secure Palestinian national
rights, Arafat said while addressing the opening ceremony of the
114th session of the Arab League Foreign Ministerial Council here.
</P>
<P>
But "the Palestinian people who have long history of resistance
and uprising will carry on with the struggles to recover East
Jerusalem," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks are "at a decisive
crossroad," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day Arab foreign ministers meeting will focus
discussions on the Middle East peace process, especially Jerusalem,
in a bid to reach a common Arab position on supporting the
Palestinians' negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians will not accept any settlement that will not
guarantee the return of the Islamic holy sites, Al-Aqsa mosque,
Islam's third holiest site, in particular, the Palestinian leader
said.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that peace will not be realized in the Middle East
if the Palestinians can not secure the legitimate national right to
establish an independent state with Jerusalem as the capital.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem lies at the heart of the Palestinian-Israeli peace
negotiations. Israel occupied Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967
Mideast War and later declared the whole of the city its "eternal
and indivisible capital," a claim never recognized by the
international community.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their
future state.

<HEADLINE> China's Fastest Locomotive Engine Comes off Production Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A bullet-shaped locomotive
designed with a maximum speed of 305 km per hour, the highest
locomotive so far in China, came off the production line today in
the Zhuzhou Locomotive Plant in central China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
The electric-powered train engine called "Lanjian" ("Blue Arrow
") has been designated as one of China's key technological
research programs. Ten academicians from the Chinese Academy of
Engineering (CAE) observed the production with engineers and
experts from the plant here today.
</P>
<P>
The train will be put into use on the Guangzhou-Shenzhen line
in south China's Guangdong Province next year. With a motor
vehicle, five carriages and a controlling compartment, the train
can accommodate more than 420 passengers.
</P>
<P>
The train is equipped with state-of-the-art technology such as
an APT control signal system.
</P>
<P>
Wang Dianzuo, vice director of CAE, said the production of the
train has signified that China has had an edge on the world's high-
speed traction technology.
</P>
<P>
The train will improve the railway transport between big cities.
With the up-coming operation of fast trains, passengers can reach
their destinations over a night trip on major railway lines within
a distance of 2,000 km like Beijing-Shenyang, Beijing-Shanghai and
Beijing-Guangzhou.

<HEADLINE> Vice Premier on Tibet's Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- China's strategy on large-scale
development of the western region will bring Tibet into a new
economic development era, said Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing
during his recent inspection tour of the highland region.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee,
urged local officials to seize the opportunity to boost economic
and social development.
</P>
<P>
He has visited higher learning institutes, companies and
cultural establishments, and listened to farmers and grassroots
officials.
</P>
<P>
He noted that great social and economic changes have taken
place in Tibet since reforms were introduced in the region. As the
growth of the regional economy is taking bolder steps, Tibet's
infrastructure, science and technology, education and sanitary
conditions have been much improved.
</P>
<P>
"This has proved the correctness of the party's ethnic policy
in Tibet," Li said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the ethnic unity and social stability are
still of paramount importance in guaranteeing the economic
development and steadily raising the living standard in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
He asked local officials to stay on alert against separatist
activities backed by the Dalai clique.
</P>
<P>
Li also pointed out that science and education are always the
key to Tibet's reform.
</P>
<P>
He said that Tibetans should rely on science and technology to
tackle problems in developing energy, telecommunications,
transportation and information industries, while protecting
natural forests and grasslands.
</P>
<P>
Building education can not only eradicate illiteracy, but also
provide the region with urgently needed talented professionals in
the course of economic development, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged central departments and well-developed areas of
the country to give more efficient support to Tibet.

YINCHUAN, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A gallery of rock paintings
at Mount Helan in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region
was opened to visitors today.
</P>
<P>
And an international symposium on rock paintings was also held,
attracting more than 130 Chinese and foreign scholars.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the tens of thousands of rock paintings carved
by nomads in northern China some 2,000 years ago at Mount Helan
are of great historic, artistic and scientific value, and Ningxia
will become a center of world rock painting research.
</P>
<P>
However, the tourist value of the rock paintings has long been
neglected. In order to better protect the paintings and attract
more visitors, Ningxia established an administration committee for
the rock paintings and built a new road leading up to the mountain.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia is also planning to set up a World Rock Painting Museum
at Mount Helan.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Agrees to Dismantle Religious Affairs Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli cabinet Sunday
morning unanimously agreed to dismantle the Religious Affairs
Ministry, a move that may infuriate the religious society.
</P>
<P>
At the weekly cabinet meeting, cabinet ministers approved Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's decision to disband the ministry as part of
his civil reform plan.
</P>
<P>
The plan was unveiled by Barak two weeks ago, in which he
promised to deliver a constitution within a year, approve civil
marriages, call for national military service for all and cancel
the Ministry of Religious Affairs.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the ministry's current departments will
be transferred to other ministries and local authorities.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed to set up a ministerial committee to be
headed by Religious Affairs and Justice Minister Yossi Beilin,
which will handle the actual issue.
</P>
<P>
Beilin recently charged that the ministry, which was under the
control of the ultra-Orthodox religious Shas party before its
resignation from the government this July, had been plagued by
political favoritism and cronyism.
</P>
<P>
It is still not clear whether or not Israel's religious society
will react harshly to Barak's plan, as the issue may fuel the
flames between the secular and religious Israelis, who had
developed more and more strain relations in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
But it was widely believed that the move will further reduce
Shas's chances to return to the coalition.
</P>
<P>
The party, which holds pivotal 17 seats in Israel's 120-member
Knesset (Parliament), was needed by Barak to restore his
parliamentary majority. Barak's coalition now controls only one
third of the Knesset seats.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel Radio Sunday quoted Beilin as saying that there
was no connection between the decision of dismantling the ministry
and the developments connected with Shas.

MANILA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Three Filipino workers were
rescued by police from their kidnappers in the southern island of
Jolo Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The three had been held captive in Talipao, Jolo, for more than
a month by one of the factions of the Abu Sayyaf group who
abducted and later released two Filipino journalists in July, the
ABS-CBN news channel reported.
</P>
<P>
The three workers are now undergoing health check in a hospital

</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf seized its latest captive, Jeffrey Schilling
from the United States, in the southern city of Zamboanga last
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Besides Schilling, the rebel group is holding two Finns, one
French, one German and one Filipino of the original group of 21
hostages kidnapped from Malaysia in April, and two French

"There are already indications that militants may create some
sensation by resorting to massacres. We are already on the job and
see what lies in the store," a senior security official in Kashmir
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to a Border Security Force (BSF) officer, the BSF is
working on intelligence inputs in order to thwart any militants'
plan and has intensified operations against the militants all over
the region.
</P>
<P>
Special emphasis was given to the protection of areas inhabited
by minority communities, which according to the past experience
easily became the target of militant attacks, the PTI noted.
</P>
<P>
During U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to India in March
this year, 35 innocent Sikhs were massacred at Chattisinghpora in
India-controlled Kashmir. Then in early August, militants again
launched a series of bloody attacks and slaughtered some 100
civilians overnight, just in an attempt to sabotage peace talks
between the Indian government and a major militant outfit in
Kashmir.

HONG KONG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- China failed to convert its
halftime lead into victory as they lost to Canada 86-73 in the

But Canada turned the tables in the second half as Nash scored
almost at will on drives to the basket and from behind the three-

</P>
<P>
Nash finished with 26 points for Canada while Rowan Barrett
scored 21 and Philadelphia 76er Todd MacCulloch added 12.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Tibet Welcomes Foreign Journalists for Objective Reporting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lhasa, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A senior Tibetan official said
today that Tibet welcomes foreign journalists to come for
objective and just reporting, but not those who take distorted
views.
</P>
<P>
Raidi, deputy secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Regional
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and chairman of
the Standing Committee of the Tibetan Autonomous Regional People's
Congress, made the remarks at a meeting here with a press
delegation of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
He said the Dalai Lama, under the pretext of religion, engages
in activities aimed at splitting the country. His cheating and
hypocrisy actually goes against the doctrine of Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
Head of the delegation, Tullaya Sirikulpipatana, agreed with
Raidi, saying the purpose of the Dalai Lama to bring Tibet back to
a society of surfs goes against historical trends.
</P>
<P>
Through the visit, the delegation found that the Western media
reported Tibet as a miserable place without freedom and human
rights, which did not accord with the reality, he said, adding
that the delegation would give objective reports about Tibet to
the Thai people.

<HEADLINE> Barak Marks 100th Day After Lebanon Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak Sunday marked the 100th day since the Israel Defense Forces
withdrawal from south Lebanon in May.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before Sunday morning's cabinet weekly meeting, Barak
claimed that the withdrawal from the former Israeli-occupied
security zone in south Lebanon was his government's great
achievement.
</P>
<P>
"Thus we did when we brought the 18-year-long Lebanese tragedy
to an end. Thus we did when we got Israel out of its dangerous
diplomatic isolation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel launched a large-scale invasion against Lebanon in 1982
to drive out the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) based
there. And it set up a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with a claimed aim to prevent terrorists from attacking
Israel's northern communities.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Barak's office quoted Barak as saying that
the past 100 days have given hope and opportunity for different
relations with Lebanon and Syria, which is the major foreign power
broker in Lebanon and had related its peace talks with Israel to
Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"For the past 100 nights, the parents of soldiers who served in
Lebanon have slept better. For 100 nights, we have not seen
helicopters flying the wounded to Ramban Hospital in Haifa," the
prime minister added.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese Muslim resistant groups, such as Hezbollah and
Amal, inflicted heavy Israeli casualties during the Israeli
occupation.
</P>
<P>
Barak said that the successful withdrawal, in which Israel
suffered no casualties at all and the border area between Israel
and Lebanon has been quiet since then, proved again that his
government could make difficult decisions and that it has not shied
away from them.
</P>
<P>
"This is a government whose responsibility is to lead and not to
be led, to initiate and not to sit on its hands and, mainly, to
promise and to carry out," he declared.
</P>
<P>
He promised that he will keep this way and do with the social-
civilian change in Israel, including the cancellation of the
Religious Affairs Ministry as part of his civil reform plan.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet will vote on Barak's decision on Sunday to disband
the ministry in a few weeks and transfer its departments to other
ministries and local authorities.
</P>
<P>
A ministerial committee headed by Religious Affairs and Justice
Minister Yossi Beilin will be formed to handle the issue. Beilin
recently charged that the ministry had been plagued by political
favoritism and cronyism.
</P>
<P>
It is still not clear whether or not Israel's religious society
will react harshly to Barak's plan. But it was widely believed that
the move will further reduce the ultra-Orthodox religious Shas
party's chances to return to the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Shas, which holds pivotal 17 seats in Israel's 120-member
Knesset (parliament) and controlled the ministry before its
resignation from the government in July, has condemned the move.

<HEADLINE> Arab FMs Open Meeting on Mideast Peace Process, Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League opened here on
Sunday the 114th meeting of its foreign ministers council to
discuss the Middle East peace process and rally support for the
Palestinians in their peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem will be the main subject of the two-day meeting of the
Arab foreign ministers, who will release a statement at the end of
the meeting, expressing support for Palestinian demand that East
Jerusalem be the capital of their future independent state.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem is an Arab, Palestinian and Islamic city that is the
core of the decades-old Arab-Israeli conflict, Arab League
Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid said in his opening address.
</P>
<P>
It is an Arab national right to recover East Jerusalem, which is
guaranteed by United Nations Security Council resolutions, Abdel-
Meguid said, stressing that there will be no bargaining or
concessions.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who attended the meeting, was
also due to address the opening session. He was expected to brief
the participants on the latest developments of the peace talks with
Israel and call for unanimous Arab support for the Palestinian
people.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied East Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast War and later
declared the whole of the holy city its "eternal and indivisible
capital," a claim the international community has never recognized.
The Arabs are insisting on Palestinian sovereignty over the eastern
sector of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the issue of Jerusalem and the Mideast peace
process, the Arab foreign ministers are also due to discuss a
proposal on convening regular Arab summits.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting Saturday night, the foreign ministers of Egypt,
Oman, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen, which formed a summit committee,
approved a mechanism for holding Arab summit in March every year.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the league's charter has made no provisions for
summits and considers the foreign ministers council the league's
highest body.

<HEADLINE> Russian President Arrives in Tokyo For Three-Day Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin
arrived here Sunday, starting a three-day official visit to Japan.
</P>
<P>
While in Tokyo, Putin is scheduled to hold three rounds of
talks with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori on Monday and
Tuesday over a wide range of bilateral and international issues.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Putin and Mori, which are expected to focus
on their plan to resolve a long-standing territorial dispute and
the signing of a bilateral peace treaty, will be the first full-
fledged negotiations in more than two years.
</P>
<P>
Japan and Russia agreed in 1997 to conclude the peace pact by
the end of 2000, but negotiations have stalled because of
differences over ways to resolve the row over a group of Russian-
held islands off Japan's northernmost prefecture of Hokkaido.
</P>
<P>
The islands are known as the Northern Territories in Japan and
the Southern Kuriles in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Japan has called for the return of the islands, which were
seized by Soviet troops at the end of World War II, but Russia has
rejected the calls.
</P>
<P>
As the gap between the two countries remains wide, analysts
said that Putin and Mori might again end up their talks merely
confirming the two countries' resolve to continue negotiations on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
Japan has maintained its stance that the territorial issue is
an inseparable part of peace treaty talks, while Russia has called
for separating the territorial row from peace treaty negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Putin stressed his position in comments earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
"We are not talking about turning over the (Southern) Kurile
Islands," Putin reportedly told reporters Sunday morning in Yuzhno-
Sakhalinsk, capital of Sakhalin, before leaving for Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
"Some people say the Russian government is trying to turn over
the (Southern) Kurile Islands, but we are only negotiating over
the issue. It is no more than that," Putin said.

<HEADLINE> S. African Hockey Team Excluded From Sydney Olympic Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- For South African
national field hockey captain Craig Jackson, the countdown to the
2000 Olympic Games in Sydney is a painful reminder of his dead
Olympic dream.
</P>
<P>
"We've put so much work into this sport and made a lot of
sacrifices," said Jackson, stressing: "Olympic competition is the
pinnacle for us. Now it's been taken away."
</P>
<P>
The National Olympic Committee of South Africa (NOCSA) earlier
this year excluded the predominantly white men's hockey squad, the
reigning African champions, from the Sydney Games, igniting an
explosion of protest that included debate in the South African
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, NOCSA still refused to yield. NOCSA President Sam
Ramsamy said the hockey squad does not have enough black players
to represent South Africa and can't erase doubts that the team
will improve on its 10th place finished at the 1996 Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
"This decision has more to do with politics and prejudice than
it does with merit. This has been a very sorry saga and a serious
setback for hockey in South Africa." said South African Hockey
Association President Clare Digby.
</P>
<P>

ninth in Sydney, the NOCSA's standard for the team's going, since

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Calls for Restraint in Jail Day Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- As tens of thousands of
people staged "Jail Day" protests here on Sunday over former Shas
party leader Aryeh Deri's imprisonment, Israeli President Moshe
Katsav urged them to show restraint and act in proper fashion.
</P>
<P>
Katsav, who defeated Regional Cooperation Minister Shimon Peres
in last July's presidential ballot with the help of the ultra-
Orthodox Shas party, calls upon Shas supporters to accept the
verdict of the court, officials in Katsav's office said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Shas spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef and Deri
himself also called on supporters to act in the framework of law in
Sunday's protests.
</P>
<P>
Deri, once a charismatic and promising political star and the
state's youngest ever interior minister, was convicted on charges
of bribery taking, breach of trust and fraud while he served as the
minister in the 1980s, and was sentenced to three years in prison
later.
</P>
<P>
As the first former cabinet minister ever sentenced to prison
terms in the country, Deri is required to report to the prison
authority Sunday noon after having exhausted appeals process since
the sentence.
</P>
<P>
Large crowds of Deri's supporters had begun their rally Sunday
morning to accompany Deri to jail and launched a series of "Jail
Day" protests against the sentence.
</P>
<P>
At the first hour of the protesting march, Deri was prevented
from speaking as his supporters, carrying black flags and placards,
pressed against his car, according to Israel Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
The convoy now is leaving Jerusalem for Ramle, where Deri is
expected to begin the process of becoming an inmate, including
prison warden's interview, talks with a psychologist, and meetings
with social workers.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of policeman had manned the streets to prevent
possible disturbances and any actions of violence, police
spokesman said Sunday. Some roads are being closed to traffic.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is to leave for the U.N.
Millenium Summit in New York Sunday night for a week of talks that
could determine both the fate of the peace process and his
government.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Prime Minister's Office have said that if Barak
is able to reach an agreement, he will bring it back to the Knesset
(parliament) and breathe new life into his government. If he comes
back empty-handed, however, new elections appear almost certain.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Activists of Israeli ultra-Orthodox Shas Party preparing
demonstrations to accompany former Shas leader Aryeh Deri to prison
on Sunday have warned that the vicinity of the Ayalon Prison in
Ramle, near Tel Aviv, could see violent confrontations between the
protesters and police.
</P>
<P>
Deri has been ordered to present himself at the Ayalon Prison at
noon and is expected to arrive at the head of thousands of
supporters who leave from his home in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Deri was convicted of taking bribes and is sentenced to three
years in prison. He was ordered to begin his sentence on Sunday
after exhausting the appeals process.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is to officially announce
Sunday that he will disband the Ministry of Religious Affairs as
part of his civil reform plan.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's office said Sunday night that Barak would
set up a ministerial committee headed by Justice Minister Yossi
Beilin, who has also been serving as acting religious affairs
minister.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States has put a Patriot missile battery stationed
in Germany on alert for possible deployment to Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post reported that senior Pentagon officials said
the action stems from concerns that Iraq might try to fire missiles
at Israel during the U.S. elections in November.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak shrugged off any threat of
Iraqi missiles. He did, however, promise to be ready for the
possibility, no matter how remote it may be.

KUALA LUMPUR, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Inspector-
General of Police Norian Mai has been directed to proceed to

the sovereignty of the country and the people's will and
determination to forge ahead.

<P>
The Malaysian consulate in Pontianak, West Kalimantan,
Indonesia, was reportedly attacked last Thursday by some 50

park.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Not to Abolish Death Penalty: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will not abolish the
death penalty until it has achieved full national consensus on the
issue, the country's Legal Affairs Minister Vincent Malambo said
here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by Sunday Mail newspaper as saying that Zambia is
not party to the Second Optional Protocol on Civil and Political
Rights which obliges state parties to abolish the death penalty
for all crimes.
</P>
<P>
"Our position as government is that we will only accede to this
protocol when we have achieved full national consensus on the
abolition of the death penalty," he told the Catholic Commission
for Justice and Peace conference on the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
He said the death penalty in his country has a constitutional
basis and is in line with the International Convenant on Civil and
Political Rights which reserves the death penalty to only the most
serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a Lusaka lawyer appealed to the government to abolish
the death penalty because it is a cruel, inhuman and degrading
punishment.

<P>
BEIRUT, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The second round of voting in
parliamentary elections started Sunday morning in seven
constituencies of Lebanon's three provinces -- Beirut, the Bekaa
Valley and the South.
</P>
<P>
Polls opened at 7:00 a.m. (0400 GMT). About 1.4 million voters
will choose 65 parliament members from 259 candidates, and decide
whether the opposition will consolidate its first round gains with
former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri back to power.
</P>
<P>
In Beirut, 19 deputies will be picked up; and 23 deputies will
be chosen in each of the provinces of the Bekaa Valley and the
South.

from the provinces of North and Mount in last Sunday's first round,
which saw opposition gains.
</P>
<P>
Elections are being held for the first time since 1972 in the

from the border strip on May 24, after a 22-year occupation there.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry has deployed 22,000 troops to guard the
elections. A ministry source said Sunday morning that the process

BAGHDAD, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Minister of Transport
Mohammad Kalaldeh, Minister of Trade and Industry Wasif Azar will
arrive here on Monday for closer trade ties between the two
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian officials are expected to hold talks with their
Iraqi counterparts and other senior officials on ways of boosting
bilateral economic cooperation and trade exchanges, the official
Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The 20th session of the Iraqi-Jordanian Joint Committee of
Cooperation, held last February, reached an agreement on
strengthening bilateral trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two Arab neighbors have witnessed a major
improvement since the July visit to Amman by Iraqi Vice President
Taha Yassin Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein held talks with Ramadan. It
was the first time for him to to meet a senior Iraqi official since
he assumed the throne in February last year.

<P>
AMMAN, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian police have recovered
two well-preserved ancient mummies from local treasure hunters from
the southern Karak district of the kingdom, police sources said on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two mummies, both females and about 3,700 years old, were
found by local treasure hunters in the Ghor Al Safi region of the
Karak district, 125 kilometers south of the capital city of Amman.
</P>
<P>
The would-be sellers were arrested by police upon a tip-off when
they tried to sell the mummies for 100,000 U.S. dollars to
potential buyers.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian archaeologists believed the two, died at 16 and 26
years of age, were mummified with substances from the high-saline
Dead Sea which prevented the bodies from decomposing.
</P>
<P>
Further police investigations are under way into the mummy
smuggling effort.

JERUSALEM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Special Middle East
peace envoy Dennis Ross returned to Washington Saturday night after
winding up his two-week-long mediation between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Before departure, Ross held his last round talks with Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak, but no details of the talks had been

</P>
<P>
Ross' mission to the region was to study the grounds for another

Yasser Arafat to soften their positions on key issues such as
Jerusalem so as to reach a peace accord on the Israeli-Palestinian
final-status talks soon.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides have come a long way...and obviously there are
still differences," Ross told reporters here Friday after meeting
with Barak.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Prime Minister's Office continue to say that
Arafat has demonstrated no flexibility since the July Camp David
summit.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinian side says that Israel is the side that needs
to compromise on all the key issues, particularly the issue of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The 15-day marathon Camp David summit failed to reach a
framework agreement on final-status issues including Jerusalem,
borders, Palestinian refugees and Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Ross returned to the region on August 17 and shuttled between
the two sides. He will report to Clinton on where the two sides
stand, before a decision can be made on whether or not to bring
Barak and Arafat together again soon.

<HEADLINE> Sugar Shortage in Kenya Artificial: Authority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The current sugar shortage in
Kenya is artificial and the government would crack down on
unscrupulous traders who hoard the commodity thereby worsening the
crisis, the Kenya Sugar Authority (KSA) has said.
</P>
<P>
The People daily Sunday quoted KSA chief executive Francis
Chahonyo as saying that the government will withdraw licenses from
such traders and confiscate their hidden stocks for release into
the market.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has experienced a nationwide sugar shortage since last
month, which has driven the price up from 45 shillings (about 60 U.
S. cents) a kilogram to 80 shillings (about 1.04 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Mombasa, a port city in southeastern Kenya,
Chahonyo vowed to crush a powerful cartel lobbying for a sugar
duty waiver for cheap sugar imports at the expense of the Kenyan
farmers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
The government might be forced in the coming week to intervene
and stabilize market prices to avert a further shortage, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Agriculture Minister Chris Obure last Wednesday
attributed the sugar shortage to the El Nino weather phenomenon
which devastated the country's sugarcane-growing areas in 1998 and
the current prolonged drought.

<HEADLINE> Russia Not to Transfer Kuriles to Japan: Putin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir
Putin said Sunday that Moscow recognizes the presence of
territorial problem with Tokyo, but will not transfer the Kuriles
Islands to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Putin made the remarks in Russia's Far East city of Yuzhno-
Sakhalinsk on Sunday morning before leaving for Tokyo for a three-
day official visit, Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
"Russia recognizes there is territorial problem between Russia
and Japan, but there is no question of turning over the Kuriles,"
he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We admit the presence of the problem, but no more than that,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Moscow never stated intentions to hand over these
islands to Japan and is just negotiating with Tokyo over the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the sovereignty of the Kuriles, which Japan
calls "Four North Islands," has had a negative influence on the
development of the Russian-Japan relations for a long time. It has
been the biggest obstacle for the two countries to conclude a
peace treaty since the end of the World War II.
</P>
<P>
Observers say the two sides will hardly achieve any progress in
this issue during Putin's visit to Japan.

<HEADLINE> Russia Welcomes U.S. Delaying of Missile Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir
Putin on Sunday reaffirmed that Moscow welcomes U.S. President
Bill Clinton's decision to put off the deployment of a national
missile defense system and is ready to continue constructive talks
with Washington on anti-ballistic missile issue.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's decision is of significance for strengthening global
strategic stability and international security, and will make it
possible for Russia to hold constructive dialogue with the United
States as a strategic partner in the future, Putin told Russian
media in the Far East city of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk before leaving for
Japan for a three-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
"Neither Russia, nor other partners, have any doubts that
Clinton's decision has been made exclusively in the interests of
the United States," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think this carefully weighed-out decision has been taken
following Clinton's consultations with the allies. I hope the
Russian position is also being taken into account. Such a decision
is important for international security, and is enhancing the
United States' prestige," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Putin confirmed that differences still exist
in the positions of Russia and the United States on the 1972 Anti-
Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. argues that the ABM treaty must be adjusted.
Clinton's decision on this issue "gives hope for a constructive
dialogue with the U.S. partners," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Friday, U.S. President Bill Clinton announced in a speech at
Georgetown University that he will leave to his successor the
decision on beginning the deployment of a national missile defense
(NMD) system because "there is not yet enough confidence in
technology and in the effectiveness of the system."

<HEADLINE> Election Fever Grips War-Torn Jaffna in Northern Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Election fever is gripping Sri
Lanka's war-torn Jaffna as 18 political parties and four
independent groups have handed in their nominations to vie for the
nine lawmakers' seat for the electoral district in the October 10
general elections, election officers said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Nominations for the northern Jaffna district were accepted as a
military operation continued in the peninsula since Thursday with
troops extensively using MIG-27 bombers and multi-barrel rocket
launchers against the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE).
</P>
<P>
The ruling People's Alliance is running in Jaffna as an
independent group while the main opposition United National Party
is running under its own banner. The other mainstream southern
parties include the JVP or People's Liberation Front, Sinhala
Urumaya (Heritage) and the New Left Front.
</P>
<P>
The entry of Sinhala Urumaya in the poll fray is interesting as
the party advocated a military solution to end the conflict with
the LTTE and is firmly opposed to any political solution based on
granting administrative autonomy to the north and the east where
minority Tamils inhabit in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil parties in the fray include Eelam People's Democratic
Party (EPDP), Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF)
, People's Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE), Tamil
Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO) and the Tamil United
Liberation Front (TULF).
</P>
<P>
The position taken by the banned LTTE is not clear as yet. It
is believed that they will support independent groups who will
follow their line.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE, fighting a 17-year war for a separate Tamil state in
Sri Lanka's north and east, has not allowed even the
democratically elected municipal councils to function smoothly in
Jaffna. They have gunned down two elected mayors belonging to the
moderate TULF before.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner of elections is to decide soon with the
security forces how the campaigning will be done in troubled
Jaffna as the nominations for the election will conclude by noon
next Monday.

<HEADLINE> China, Iceland Agree to Further Strengthen Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
REYKJAVIK, Iceland, September 2 (Xinhua) -- China and Iceland
agreed here on Saturday to step up efforts to further develop
bilateral relations in such fields as economy, trade and culture,
and cooperation in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached when visiting top Chinese legislator
Li Peng met separately with Icelandic President Olafur Ragnar
Grimsson and Prime Minister David Oddsson, shortly after his
arrival here on a four-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with President Grimsson, Li Peng, Chairman
of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC)
of China, said that although China and Iceland are located far
apart geographically, the two countries share a great deal of
common interests in safeguarding world peace and promoting common
development.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also hold identical and similar views on many
important international issues, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said China attaches great importance to developing
cooperative relations with Iceland and is willing to further
promote its cooperation with Iceland in every possible area.
</P>
<P>
The top Chinese legislator also expressed his hope that his
current visit would help push forward relations between the
legislative bodies of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Grimsson agreed with Li's comment on the development of
relations between the two countries. He said that the friendly
relationship between Iceland and China is an outstanding example
of equal and mutually-beneficial cooperation between countries of
different size.
</P>
<P>
China has always been upholding the principle that all
countries, regardless of their size, are equal members of the
international community, Li said, adding that he reiterated this
principle at the just-concluded millennium summit of the presiding
officers of national parliaments at the United Nations
Headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
And parliamentary leaders from many countries agreed with the
points China advocated at the summit, Li said.
</P>
<P>
At a separate meeting with Icelandic Prime Minister Oddsson, Li
said he was deeply impressed by the achievements Iceland has made
in its economic and scientific and technological development.
</P>
<P>
These achievements prove once again that every country can
surely succeed in its national development, so long as the people
of the country choose the path of development, or the model of
economic development, according to the specific conditions of the
country, the Chinese leader said.
</P>
<P>
Oddsson said he hoped Iceland and China would continue to
double their efforts to further develop friendly cooperation in
every possible field.
</P>
<P>
He noted that although there are some differences between the
two countries, the development of bilateral cooperation is not
adversely affected by them.
</P>
<P>
Like President Grimsson, the prime minister also highly
appreciated China's stance that all countries around the world
should be equal members of the international community regardless
of their difference in size.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Banks Issue Unsecured Student Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Freshmen of two Shanghai
universities have become the first group to benefit from the
education loans without security newly launched by the Shanghai-
based banks.
</P>
<P>
A freshman of the Tongji University from a poverty-hit area
said he had thought it rather complicated to get a loan, but it
was actually a simple procedure. With the loan, he did not have to
worry about the tuition.
</P>
<P>
Another Tongji student said though he was from a well-off
family, he wanted to apply for the loan as well, just to propel
himself to study hard and to learn to shoulder responsibility.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China has recently issued a new student
loans regulation, which allows loans without security.
Postgraduate students of the Shanghai No.2 Medical Sciences
University only presented their entrance notices, ID cards and
certificates from the university to apply for the loan.
</P>
<P>
The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Shanghai Branch has

<HEADLINE> Kayin Ethnic Armed Group Members Surrender in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-seven members of the
Kayin National Union (KNU), Myanmar's largest anti-government
ethnic armed group which has not made peace yet with the
government, surrendered to the government forces in late last
month, official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 57 members, led by Pado Chit Po, "exchanged arms for peace"
in Tanintharyi township, southern Tanintharyi division, on August
26.
</P>
<P>
They brought along with them 17 assorted arms, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The KNU has been operating for over five decades since the
early days of Myanmar's independence. In early 1995, the KNU lost
their headquarters at Manerplaw and Kawmura on Myanmar-Thai border
during attack by its splinter group, the Democratic Kayin Buddhist
Army, backed by the government.
</P>
<P>
Again since December that year, four rounds of peace talks were
held between the government and the armed group but failed to
produce result.
</P>
<P>
According to official disclosure, up to now, 17 anti-government
ethnic armed groups as well as the Mong Tai Army, led by former
drug warlord Khun Sa, have made peace with the government with
cease-fire agreements reached between them.

<HEADLINE> Cybercrime Surges in First Six Months in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of cybercrime
cases reported in the first six months of this year is already
about two-thirds those committed over the whole of last year, the
Sunday Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted a policy source as saying that the increase is
likely to continue as more people use computers and hook onto the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
Between January and June, 127 computer crimes, including three
hacking cases, were reported, compared with 185 such cases for the
whole of last year which included 13 incidents of computer hacking,
the police source said.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, in 1997, however, there were only 39.
</P>
<P>
Using other people's email accounts and computer passwords
without their permission, made up the bulk of the cases so far
this year.
</P>
<P>
The Police attributed the increase to the rising capacity for
computer misuse and abuse as a result of increasing reliance of IT
as an efficient means of carrying out day-to-day activities.
</P>
<P>
If the six-month trend for the year continue, said the Police,
the number of computer crimes could hit 254 by year-end, or 38
percent more than last year.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Economic Growth Rate This Year to Be No Lower Than 4.1 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's economic growth
rate this year would not be lower than 4.1 percent, The Thai News
Agency (TNA) reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chatumongkol Sonakul, the Governor of The Bank of Thailand (BOT)
, the country's central bank, was quoted as saying that Thailand's
economic growth rate this year would not be lower than 4.1 percent,
despite a current oil price hike.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed a recent projection of the Thailand Development
Research Institute (TDRI) that the Thai economy would grow no more
than 4.1 percent this year, citing strong exports that reached six
billion U.S. dollars in July, the highest monthly level in three
years, and continued U.S. economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices will not have a significant impact on the Thai
economy this year. Indeed, the psychological effect of a current
oil price hike is higher than its real effect on the country's
manufacturing sector, said the BOT chief.
</P>
<P>
Before the current oil price surge, the central bank and the
Finance Ministry forecast that the Thai economy would grow 4.5-5.5
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Finance Ministry reported that Thai exports,
based on a Customs Department report, in the first seven months of
this year reached 39 billion U.S. dollars, a 21.2 percent increase
from the same period of last year; while imports touched 34.07
billion U.S. dollars, an increase of 25 percent from the same
period of 1999.
</P>
<P>
In the January-to-July period, Thailand had a trade surplus,
based on the Customs Department figure, of 4.929 million U.S.
dollars, a slightly higher than that of 4.920 million U.S. dollars
in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Ministry's Department of Internal Trade also
forecast that the country's overall inflation this year would be
no more than 2.5 percent, as earlier targeted by the government,
though the consumer index in August rose by 0.6 percent from July'
s level.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar will hold this year's
mid-year gems emporium, which is the ninth of its kind, on October
3 to put on sale locally-produced gems, pearl and jewelry through
competitive bidding or tender, official newspaper The New Light of
Myanmar reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The event will be sponsored by the Myanma Gems Enterprise of
the Ministry of Mines.
</P>
<P>
Mid-year gems emporiums were introduced since 1992 in addition
to annual events which have been held since 1964.
</P>
<P>
At the 37th annual Myanma gems emporium, held in March this
year, a total of 23.847 million U.S. dollars were fetched,
breaking the past highest record of 1990's 27th emporium which
earned 14.839 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The 37th annual gems emporium attracted 437 foreign gems
merchants of 215 companies from 11 countries and regions as well
as 183 local gems traders.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is a well-known producer of jade, ruby and sapphire in
the world and the country earned a total of over 300 million
dollars from its 37 annual and eight mid-year gems emporiums,
according to official statistics.

<HEADLINE> China's Pawnshops Status under Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- China's 1,300 or so pawnshops
have been transferred from the control of the central bank to that
of the State Economic and Trade Commission, according to today's
Business Weekly of China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The change of status from financial institution to industrial
and commercial enterprise is expected to lead to many changes,
such as looser regulations and better taxation policies.
</P>
<P>
"To regulate pawnshops as industrial and commercial enterprises
is actually a proper response to market demand," said Li Cheng,
general manager with the Beijing-based Baoruitong Pawnshop.
</P>
<P>
China's 1,500-year-old pawnshops were wiped out after the
founding of new China in 1949, but emerged again in 1987. As small
financial enterprises under the control of the bank, pawnshops
could focus on individuals and private businesses and grant small
loans with a simpler application process than that in commercial
banks.
</P>
<P>
Pawnshops have been restricted in many respects including the
capital funds, the setting-up of branch organizations and business
scope.
</P>
<P>
Also, pawnshops have not been able to settle "dead pawns"--
items given up by customers-- but have to o it through
intermediaries. This means a kind of broker gets involved to sell
the item the customer no longer wants.
</P>
<P>
This has not only increased costs for pawnshops, but has also
meant they are unable to settle some dead pawns as China's
intermediary market is still immature, said Duan Ming, general
manager with the Beijing Jinbao Pawnshop.

<P>
-- Wei Jianxing, a member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee, met with a delegation from the All-Japan Prefectural

</P>
<P>
Wei, also a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee and president of the All-China Federation of Trade
Unions (ACFTU), said that China places great importance on
developing friendship and cooperation with Japan, and trade unions
of the two countries have long-standing exchanges. He expressed
the hope that workers and trade unions of the two countries
further promote exchanges and mutual understanding and friendship.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
-- China said that U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision not
to deploy the National Missile Defense is "rational".
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao, in a statement
on the matter, said that China has taken note of such a decision
made by President Clinton on September 1, and held that the
decision is rational.
</P>

China reiterates that the maintenance of the global strategic
stability and security is in the interests of all countries, and
conducive to world peace and stability as well as to international

<P>
-- As the Chinese government is reforming its fiscal system to
increase revenue and reduce expenditure, experts here believe that
the State treasury is capable of making ends meet after the
country's accession to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
According to the Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng, China will
reform the tax system in the coming years. Instead of taxing
production, China will target consumption in order to gradually
shift its value-added tax levy.
</P>
<P>
The country will adopt a unified income tax system for Chinese
and foreign-funded enterprises instead of its current preferential
policies, which aims to serve the government's goal of increasing
the amount of foreign capital of the country, said Liu.
</P>
<P>
The anticipated tax reform is also expected to improve the
country's personal income tax system and adopt an inheritance tax
to narrow the gap between the rich and the poor.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Aceh Cease-Fire Accord Extended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government and
the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) have reached an agreement to extend
their three-month cease-fire accord which expired Saturday (Sep. 2)
, an official statement said here.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued by a body called "Joint Forum for the
Humanitarian Pause" Saturday evening, said the two sides "
reconfirmed their support for the Humanitarian Pause in Aceh and
have agreed in principle to extend it to the second phase."
</P>
<P>
The three-paragraph statement did not say for how long the
accord was to be extended.
</P>
<P>
But, "the requirements from both sides for Phase II will be
discussed in detail at a Joint Forum meeting scheduled for mid-
September in Switzerland," Antara News Agency reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Saturday, Indonesian Coordinating Minister for
Political, Social and Security Affairs Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono
said that President Abdurrahman Wahid had approved the temporary
extension of the cease-fire or called Humanitarian Pause.
</P>
<P>
Signed in Davos, Switzerland last May 12, the original
agreement took effect more than a fortnight later on June 2 for
three months.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Indonesian government and the GAM
agreed to reduce tension and stop violence in the province.
</P>
<P>
Rebels in Aceh have been fighting for 25 years for independence,
a greater share of oil profits, and the right to impose Islamic
religious laws. Thousands have been killed in decades of fighting
between Indonesian security forces and Aceh rebels.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Arms Trafficking Ring Leaders Captured in Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A Peruvian and a Spaniard, two
alleged leaders of an arms trafficking ring that delivered
thousands of rifles to the Colombian guerrillas, were detained
here on Saturday, Peruvian National Police said.
</P>
<P>
Former Peruvian army lieutenant Luis Frank Aybar and Spanish
citizen Juan Manuel Lopez Rodriguez were arrested when they were
riding in a car driven by Jose Alejandro del Mar, also a Peruvian,
said the police in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Aybar and Lopez, who had tried to change their physical aspect
to dodge police investigation, have been detained in the Police
State Security Department, where they are being interrogated by
the special prosecutor in charge of the case, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Aybar and other members of the ring reportedly pretended to be
Peruvian army generals and in that guise bought 50,000 Russian-
made rifles from Jordan to deliver them to the guerrilla
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
</P>
<P>
The arms trafficking ring was uncovered by the Peruvian
information services after the presence of a Russian cargo plane
was detected in the Peruvian jungle, that supposedly had arrived
from Ukraine to buy two tons of compact wood.
</P>
<P>
It was established during the investigation that in 1999, the
Russian plane flew from Jordan with a cargo of 10,000 AK rifles
that were dropped with parachutes when the aircraft was flying
over Colombian territory controlled by the FARC.
</P>
<P>
The case was first unveiled by Peruvian President Albert
Fujimori in September 1999.

China will be able to generate more tax revenue after its WTO

people's income will rise, said Li Jingwen, an expert with the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>

China's incorporation into the world economy will allow more
foreign companies to invest in the country, which means more

Factories in Three Gorges Urged to Curb Pollution
</P>
<P>
The State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) has
urged factories in the Three Gorges area to bring pollution under
control as required.
</P>
<P>
So far, about half of the factories, either in operation or
under construction in this area, are not up to the state pollution
control standards, posing a threat to the quality of water in the
middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River covered by the huge
reservoir at the Three Gorges, the SEPA said.
</P>
<P>
According to the SEPA, a project in the Three Gorges area must
curb pollution right from stage of designing, construction to
operation.

Chinese Seaside Resort Combats Water Pollution
</P>
<P>
All of the polluted water in Beidaihe, one of China's most
famous summer resorts, has been disposed of and cleaned before
flowing into the sea, an official source said.
</P>
<P>
The quality of sea water there has been significantly improved
this summer and has met the requirements of the state's first-
class sea water standard, according to the local environment
monitoring center.
</P>
<P>
Last year the local government invested 120 million yuan (15
million U.S. dollars) on a sewage-disposal factory which started
operation earlier this summer. The government also launched a
drive to clean the rubbish so as to protect the ocean from being
polluted.

<P>
Shanghai to Recycle Sewage for Manufacturing Use
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is stepping up research of techniques in recycling
waste water for manufacturing use.
</P>
<P>
Within one year's time, it is expected that large quantities of
sewage and waste water produced by the city, estimated at 5.8
million cubic meters per day, together with abundant rainwater,
will become a major water source for washing vehicles, watering
plants, and irrigating farmland.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that with the new technique, the city's
pollution will be reduced and water resources will used more
efficiently.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Lee Hyung-Taik, who was
playing for his first major tennis tournament, surprised all by
reaching the round-of-16 at the U.S. Open here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 182nd-ranked Lee defeated German Rainer Schuttler 6-2, 3-6,
6-4 and 6-4, with his impending clash against four-time champion
Pete Sampras for a quarterfinal spot on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sampras never heard of Lee before this week, nor had he ever
heard of the guy he struggled against in the steamy heat on
Saturday, Argentina's Agustin Calleri, in a 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-3),
6-3 win.
</P>
<P>
"I was told by someone in the locker room that he was a lefty
that stays back," Sampras said. "He was a righty that hits the
ball big. Bad information."
</P>
<P>
"He's going to come out swinging away, like the guy I played
today did," Sampras said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Galo Blanco of Spain knock off two-time champion
Patrick Rafter, and Arnaud Clement of France beat defending
champion Andre Agassi in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
No Korean man had ever gone beyond the first round in a major
tournament, making Lee, 24, not only a surprise here but a
celebrity in his homeland.
</P>
<P>
"He's the highest-ranked Korean player ever, so he's just
creating history in Korea when it comes to tennis," said Lee's
interpreter, Chris Kim of MBC, a Korean television network.
</P>
<P>
The tournament produced another string of upsets with Conchita
Martinez, Anna Kournikova, Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Mark
Philippoussis becoming the latest victims.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov, seeded No. 5, lost to Dominik Hrbaty 6-4, 7-6 (7-5),
6-1, and Jan-Michael Gambill upset the 15th-seeded Philippoussis 6-
4, 6-4, 6-4 in the
final second-round match postponed by rain Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Martinez, seeded seventh, lost to Elena Dementieva of Russia 6-
4, 6-1, and Justine Henin of Belgium ousted Kournikova, the No. 12
seed, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5).
</P>
<P>
In another men's match, ninth-seeded Lleyton Hewitt defeated
Jiri Novak of the Czech Republic 6-3, 6-3, 6-3. Also getting
through were No. 2 Lindsay Davenport, No. 4 Mary Pierce and No. 10
Anke Huber.
</P>
<P>
Davenport beat Tamarine Tanasugarn 6-2, 6-1, Pierce defeated
Lisa Raymond 6-4, 7-6 (7-6), Huber down Elena Likhovtseva 6-2, 6-3,
Lilia Osterloh beat Shinobu Asagoe 7-5, 6-0, and Jelena Dokic
stopped Francesca Schiavone 7-6 (4), 7-5.

<HEADLINE> UAE to Use European Food Safety Regulations for Reference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates'
General Secretariat of Municipalities (GSM) is consulting the
latest European Union white paper on food safety to modify the UAE
food safety specifications.
</P>
<P>
The white paper will be used as a base reference to boost the
emirates' own safety specifications, reported the official news
agency WAM on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The GSM, established in 1981, has been coordinating with UAE
municipalities to have a unified, standard safety code which will
include Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) food specifications, WAM
added.
</P>
<P>
According to a source from the GSM, other international food
safety specifications have always been studied during the period of
reviewing UAE standards.
</P>
<P>
The source said the GSM is now studying whether to add local
specifications according to GCC standards and other international
standards.
</P>
<P>
"The white paper is so useful because we know how one of the
biggest import and export unions for food products in the world is
drawing up legislation, keeping us abreast of what's happening and
it gives an opinion on what types of food are not fit for
consumption," added the source.
</P>
<P>
The EU white paper was issued in Brussels on January 12. The
paper deals with food and animal health, additives, flavouring and
packaging.

<HEADLINE> UAE Urged to Form Federal Tourism Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
United Arab Emirates has recommended the setting up of a federal
tourism authority to promote the country as a tourist destination
worldwide, reported local media on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Tariq bin Faisal Al Qasimi, chairman of the Economic
Development Department, has stressed the importance of establishing
such a federal authority to further promote the image of the
country in the world, and to support the national economy by
boosting the local tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Tariq commented that setting up such an authority has
become a vital need since the tourism industry in the UAE is
growing day by day, saying "wherever you go in the world, you find
countries have their own national tourism ministries or
authorities. So there is no reason why we should not have the same
here in the UAE."
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he said, it will support federal tourism
development and boost local tourism plans in each emirate as well.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has yet an unified authority in charge of the country's
tourism business, while the tourism is now operated by individual
emirates, facing many difficulties in building big infrastructure
projects in the field of tourism.

LAGOS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- More than 5,000 volunteers in
Nigeria are to launch a campaign to clean up the country's beaches
so as to raise people's awareness on environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The volunteers, including students, government or non-
governmental employees, are expected to start the exercise on
September 16 on beaches in Nigeria's coastal cities like Lagos,
Port Harcourt.
</P>
<P>
They will remove millions of kilograms of pieces of debris and

Ene Bab-Owoh, chairman of Clean-up Nigeria, a non-governmental
organization and organizer of the exercise, said on Sunday here

Nigeria needs the kind of awareness and efforts on
environmental protection in other parts of the world, he said.

<HEADLINE> S. African Government Urged to Ban Plastic Bags </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- South African
Environmental Affairs and Tourism Minister Valli Moosa said on
Sunday he hoped legislation would be introduced in Parliament
early next year to ban the general use of plastic bags in the
country once and for all.
</P>
<P>
The bags were the most visible symbol of a country which was
becoming dirtier by the day, especially in the poorer areas, he
told South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
He said he had received widespread support for the move when he
had announced it a year ago and government regulations on plastic
bags had already been issued.
</P>
<P>
Turning to tourism, Moosa said South Africa should not allow
itself to become paralyzed by a series of Cape Town bombings or
high crime levels.
</P>
<P>
Moosa said his department and tourist agencies were currently
embarking on the biggest-ever international marketing campaign to
attract more tourists for South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, Europe had yielded the most, but the United
States market had also grown and one of the biggest markets which
had now opened was Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moosa said most foreign tourists were now coming from this
continent.
</P>
<P>
South Africans also needed to be made more aware of what their
own country had to offer, Moosa said.
</P>
<P>
The government was doing all in its power to ensure that
opportunities were created for black South Africans to become more
involved in tourism service industries like hotels and restaurants.

<P>
LONDON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Commercial property in the City
of London is facing a downturn as companies cut back on office
holdings following a wave of mergers, according to a new research
released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Surveying firm DTZ Debenham Tie Leung predicts that merger and
acquisition activity will lead to the release of at least 6.4
million sq ft of surplus office space in central London by 2003.
</P>
<P>
The firm said that Royal Bank Scotland's acquisition of NatWest
and Deutsche Bank's acquisition of Bankers Trust will have the
biggest impact over the period.
</P>
<P>
According to APR, an independent property research group, this
situation is potentially damaging for the health of the City
property market.
</P>
<P>
Paul Ives, head of the research, said, "The space will drag
down rents in the City. It is due for a downturn next year, anyway,
and this could accelerate the process."
</P>
<P>
The report by DTZ comes at a time when there is growing concern
among property companies and investors that London's property
market may have reached its cyclical peak.
