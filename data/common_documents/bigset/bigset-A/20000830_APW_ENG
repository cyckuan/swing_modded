Rebels Threaten To Kill American Hostage
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Muslim rebels in the Philippines threatened
Tuesday to kill an American man they have kidnapped unless the United States
accepts their demands. Jeffrey Craig Edwards Schilling, of Oakland, Calif., was
seized Monday by a faction of the Abu Sayyaf rebel group, which this week
released six other Western hostages in return for a reported $6 million ransom
but was still holding 18 other captives. But the faction holding Schilling
insisted the prospect of more ransom was not behind the latest kidnapping. In
past abductions, the faction has demanded the release of Muslim militants jailed
in the United States for the World Trade Center bombing and other planned
attacks.

   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- President Clinton said Tuesday he should not be

Aid Offered to Drought-Stricken Texas
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BOYD, Texas (AP) -- Gazing across a field of shrunken yellow watermelons on
withered vines, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman Tuesday promised federal aid
to four more counties in drought-stricken north Texas. Glickman's visit marked
the 60th consecutive day without measurable rainfall in north Texas, where crops
are parched and reservoirs are drying up. The previous record was 58 days, set
in 1934 and 1950. ''These folks are really hurting,'' he said. ''I don't like to
be here on a day setting records -- not these kinds of records, anyway.''
Glickman has previously declared 153 Texas counties either primary or contiguous
agricultural disaster areas.

Mont. Gov.: Declare Disaster Area
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   RED LODGE, Mont. (AP) -- Montana's governor asked President Clinton to
declare Montana a federal disaster area Tuesday because of its huge wildfires,
as exhausted firefighters looked hopefully toward the weekend and the
possibility of rain. Gov. Marc Racicot told Clinton the state has exhausted its
fire fighting resources and asked for a federal disaster declaration that would
free up more federal money. The governor estimated wildfires are costing Montana
businesses $3 million a day. The National Interagency Fire Center in Boise,
Idaho, said there were 31 large fires burning on 674,000 acres in Montana
Tuesday.

Ford Denies Withholding Information
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. said Tuesday that its first report
of problems with Firestone tires on Explorer sport utility vehicles in Venezuela
came in 1998 -- two years before it began replacing tires for customers there.
Ford officials in Venezuela said they began recalling tires in May only after
waiting for Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. to act. The automaker denied charges that
it withheld information about defective tires that may have caused at least 10
deaths here, and also said the design of the Explorer did not contribute to
tread separations and blowouts in Firestone tires.

Police Raid Japan Milk Manufacturer
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Police on Wednesday raided the Tokyo headquarters of Japan's
largest dairy products maker, which is under investigation for selling
bacteria-tainted milk that caused a massive food poisoning. Investigators also
searched Snow Brand Milk Products Co.'s regional main office in Osaka on
suspicion of professional negligence. No arrests were made. Most of the 14,800
people sickened in the June food poising live in Osaka, about 254 miles west of
Tokyo. The Snow Brand case and a chain of other recent contaminations of food
with bugs, broken pieces of plastic and other objects have triggered a national
food scare and loss of public trust in Japan's food industry.

fell victim to lanky Australian qualifier Wayne Arthurs' 26 aces in a 4-6, 6-3,
7-6 (4), 7-6 (1) defeat. If the fans thought that upset would be a prelude to
another, Serena Williams quickly set out to disabuse them of that notion by
ripping a return winner on the first point as she proceeded to crush 19-year-old
Slovenian Tina Pisnik 6-3, 6-2.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Minorities Become Majority  </HEADLINE>
By TOM VERDIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- California's minority population became the
majority in 1999, continuing a demographic evolution that could
have wide-ranging consequences for the state's political future.
</P>
<P>
   The state's non-Hispanic white population was 49.8 percent last
year, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates released Wednesday.
In 1990, non-Hispanic whites were 57 percent of California's
population.
</P>
<P>
   That marks the first time since 1860, when accurate census data
for California started being recorded, that whites did not have a
majority, according to the state Department of Finance.
</P>
<P>
   To Californians, however, the landmark passed quietly. The
state's demographics have shifted gradually over the past decade as
it became a destination for waves of immigrants from Asia, Mexico
and Central and South America.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state as a whole has been pretty aware of the trend and
the projections for some time,'' said Bruce Cain, a political
science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. ''We
already know that we have to adjust to diversity, but it makes the
point that much more salient when you hit the 50 percent mark.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's changing face already is being reflected in state
politics. In 1998, for example, Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante became the
first Hispanic elected to statewide office since 1871.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say issues important to immigrant communities --
such as better education for students in urban school districts --
will take priority as more Hispanics gain political power.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues also could polarize a populace that in the 1990s
voted to end many social programs for illegal immigrants, limit
bilingual education and ban racial and gender quotas.
</P>
<P>
   One source of possible friction: White retirees who might be
less willing to fund programs for poorer inner-city communities
that are largely young and non-white, said James P. Allen, a
population geographer at California State University, Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   ''The big block of voters are whites, many of them older,'' he
said. ''Many whites are in a tax-revolting mood and don't want to
fund education.''
</P>
<P>
   Asians and Hispanics are the fastest growing of the state's
ethnic groups, with both populations increasing by nearly 35
percent between 1990 and 1999, according to the census projections.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics account for 31.5 percent of the state's population,
while Asians are just more than 12 percent. The state's Asian
population of roughly 4 million accounts for more than 37 percent
of all Asians in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   California's non-Hispanic white population was the only ethnic
group to decline, from 17 million in 1990 to 16.5 million in 1999.
The populations of blacks and American Indians increased slightly,
with blacks accounting for 7.5 percent of California residents.
</P>
<P>
   The demographic shift occurs as the state's population growth
continues to outpace the nation's. California's population grew to
33.1 million in 1999, a 10.6 percent increase since 1990, according
to the Census Bureau.

<HEADLINE> Larry Hagman Backs Pesticide Plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Larry Hagman is just wild about baked
bugs, roasted rat and broiled bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Dallas'' and ''I Dream of Jeannie'' TV star joined other
pesticide opponents Tuesday by pushing for the use of extreme heat
in school buildings rather than pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Hagman also has thrown his support behind a proposal that would
require schools to notify parents and post public notices before
and after pesticides are used in schools. It would encourage
schools to seek alternatives like heat treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forsberg, president of the Western Crop Protection
Association that represents pesticide manufacturers, retailers and
distributors, fears opponents have the ulterior motive of trying to
''stigmatize pesticide use.''
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate the new heat treatments, supporters of the
technique draped the exterior walls of a Capitol storage building
with tent-like material, then pumped in superheated air that topped
130 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   As the cockroaches and rodents scattered, Hagman equated it to
pasteurizing milk to kill bacteria: ''It's an old process that has
been rejuvenated.''

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- An overqualified busker plans to
serenade downtown workers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   John Mellencamp, whose hits include ''Pink Houses,'' ''Small
Town'' and ''Jack and Diane,'' was to perform for free at
Legislative Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   All summer, the singer-songwriter has been traveling the country
with two acoustic performers -- a fiddle player and an accordionist.
Then he picks a spot in a city, sets up and plays.
</P>
<P>
   The singer has said he wants to perform on the streets for free
to give something back to his fans. ''I'm just playing for the
people. I don't want the newspapers writing that 'He was out
promoting his new record,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rocker has already performed similar low-tech shows in
Chicago, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Detroit and Cleveland. On
Tuesday, he played Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   His next free acoustic performance was scheduled for lunchtime
Thursday in Bloomington, Ind. Mellencamp also was scheduled to
appear Sept. 17 at the Farm Aid 2000 relief concert in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Port Spruced Up For Clinton  </HEADLINE>
By JAVIER BAENA
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) -- No matter how bad things get in
Colombia, the violence-wracked South American country can always
put its best face forward with Cartagena, the gem of a
Spanish-colonial seaport being visited by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The walled Caribbean city is the government's ace-in-the-hole
for providing foreign dignitaries with flawless weather, fresh
seafood, pulsating music and relative peace.
</P>
<P>
   The city was even more attractive than usual for Clinton's
9-hour visit Wednesday thanks to a mildly controversial $850,000
makeover that forced vendors and beggars off the street, repaved
roads and repainted pastel-colored buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Some local politicians have questioned the makeover for the
brief visit, given the city's tight budget and a severe nationwide
recession including 20 percent unemployment. Others say Clinton
should be given a more realistic view of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be better if he didn't just see Cartagena's beauty,
but also got a look at what goes on in Colombia and visited areas
affected by guerrilla violence and drug trafficking,'' said
Adalberto Martinez, a court employee.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Gina Benedetti defended the work, and many residents were
brimming with pride.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've never seen Cartagena so beautiful, peaceful and safe,''
said taxi driver Nelson Duran. ''Clinton should come more often.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Guillermo Fernandez joked Tuesday that Clinton
is ''the best public works chairman Cartagena has ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton is impressed, Cartagena may get more than just a
makeover. The city is reportedly seeking exemption from a U.S.
government travel advisory that warns U.S. citizens to stay away
from Colombia and its rampant crime and kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   The city is a relative oasis in the country's sea of violence,
despite its large population of war refugees. It is by far
Colombia's top tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to painting houses and walls that withstood attacks
by English pirates more than 300 years ago, workers have been
patching potholes, fixing broken street lamps and raking trash off
the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Between meetings to discuss a $1.3 billion aid plan to help
Colombia stem the country's booming cocaine and heroin trade,
Clinton was to tour the UNESCO-protected seaport.
</P>
<P>
   He also was scheduled to ride a horse-drawn carriage around
Cartagena's walled historic center, erected by the Spanish at the
edge of a breezy turquoise bay. Street vendors who typically clog
the cobblestone streets were banned during the visit, and homeless
children who often harass tourists for change are put up in
temporary housing.

   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- A tropical storm brushed against Taiwan on Tuesday,
dumping heavy rain on the northern part of the island barely a week after a
typhoon killed 14 people and collapsed hundreds of homes. The storm, named
Prapiroon, caused little damage because its winds were relatively weak, but
officials were on alert for mudslides and flash floods that frequently follow
heavy rainfall on this mountainous island. In Miaoli county, downpours triggered
a landslide that blocked traffic on a mountain road, state radio said.
Forecasters predicted that mountainous areas around the capital, Taipei, could

Drug Reduces Heart Failure Deaths
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, The Netherlands (AP) -- A new heart drug has proven effective in
treating people with severe heart failure, reducing deaths by 35 percent,
research shows. The drug, carvedilol, belongs to a relatively new class of
medications called beta blockers, which lighten the heart's workload. It had
already proven effective in prolonging the lives of people with mild to moderate
stages of the disease, but doctors had been reluctant to give it to severe heart
failure patients. Experts say the findings, presented Tuesday at a conference of
the European Society of Cardiology, should allay long-standing concerns that
beta blockers could make heart failure worse because they depress the heart
rate.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Edgar Martinez hit a come-from-behind grand slam
off Jeff Nelson with two outs in the eighth inning, and the Seattle
Mariners stunned the New York Yankees 5-3 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte (16-7), who had won seven straight starts, took a
no-hit bid into the sixth inning and three-hit shutout into the
eighth before allowing one-out singles to David Bell, Carlos
Guillen and Rickey Henderson that loaded the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Javier hit a liner to left that Luis Polonia dropped while
attempting a back-handed catch -- it was ruled a hit -- driving in
the first run and chasing Pettitte.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Nelson, who has griped in recent weeks about being
unappreciated, came in and struck out Alex Rodriguez on a 1-2
pitch, before Martinez poked a pitch into the right-field bleachers
for his 32nd homer of the season and fourth career slam.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Tomko (7-4) pitched two scoreless innings of two-hit
relief as Seattle won for just the third time in 16 games. Kazuhiro
Sasaki pitched a 1-2-3 ninth for his 30th save in 33 chances.
</P>
<P>
   New York's AL East lead was cut to four games over second-place
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte, who hadn't lost since July 20, had been backed by
seven or more runs in 15 of 25 starts coming in, including seven in
a row. But this time, New York's offense failed him.
</P>
<P>
   He lost his no-hit bid in the sixth when Guillen dumped a bloop
single between second baseman Luis Sojo and right fielder David
Justice.
</P>
<P>
   David Justice and Glenallen Hill hit RBI singles in the first
off Jamie Moyer, who threw a run-scoring wild pitch in the second.
</P>
<P>
Notes: 1B Tino Martinez was out of the Yankees' starting lineup
after he hyperextended his left foot in Monday night's game.
Martinez was replaced at 1B by C Jorge Posada, who was replaced by
Chris Turner at catcher. Martinez is expected to be able to play
Wednesday night. ... The Mariners activated Rob Ramsay from the
15-day DL, giving them two LHPs in their bullpen. The other is
Arthur Rhodes. They made room for Ramsay, who was sidelined by a
strained left biceps, by optioning RHP Joel Pineiro to Triple-A
Tacoma. ... Safeco Field's retractable roof was closed for the
first time since July 22, when the roof became stuck open and there
was a 54-minute rain delay.

<HEADLINE> Cubs 7, Padres 6, 13 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Pinch-hitter Ricky Gutierrez had a sacrifice fly
in the 13th inning Tuesday night as the Chicago Cubs outlasted the
San Diego Padres 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Young led off the bottom of the 13th with a double off
Trevor Hoffman (4-6). Damian Jackson, who had just moved to left
field from second, misjudged the ball and slipped in the grass as
he tried to move.
</P>
<P>
   Young took third on Gary Matthews Jr.'s sacrifice, and the
Padres loaded the bases with intentional walks to Sammy Sosa and
Mark Grace.
</P>
<P>
   That brought up Gutierrez, who lofted a liner to center. Mike
Darr fielded it, but Young beat the throw home. He jumped up to
celebrate as the Cubs poured out of the dugout. It was only their
eighth win in 20 extra-inning games this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs could have had the win four innings earlier, but Rick
Aguilera blew a save in the ninth after converting nine straight
opportunities. Aguilera gave up a leadoff single to Jackson, struck
out Ryan Klesko and walked Phil Nevin. Darr then singled to right,.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Heredia (7-3) gave up three hits and one intentional walk
in two innings.
</P>
<P>
   Nevin drove in two runs in the third, giving him 100 RBIs in a
season for the first time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs had far bigger problems than Aguilera's blown save.
Chicago pitchers walked nine, five by starter Jamie Arnold in
five-plus innings. Arnold also forced in the Padres' first run with
a walk to Ryan Klesko in the third inning, and loaded the bases
twice more.
</P>
<P>
   But, for once, the Cubs actually got some clutch hits.
</P>
<P>
   With the score 5-5 in the sixth, Todd Erdos loaded the bases
with a walk to Matthews, a single by Sosa and another walk to
Grace. Roosevelt Brown then hit a sacrifice fly to right field,
giving the Cubs the 6-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Padres starter Adam Eaton had gone 3-0 with a 1.29 ERA in his
previous four starts, but he never looked sharp. With two outs in
the third, he walked Sosa and Grace. Brown then hit an RBI single
just inside the first-base line, Joe Girardi followed with an RBI
single past a diving Jackson, and Willie Greene singled to tie it
at 3.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs got two more in the fifth on Girardi's sacrifice fly
and Greene's fielder's choice.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres tied the game in the sixth as Wiki Gonzalez drove in
a run with a broken-bat single and Desi Relaford hit a sacrifice
fly.
</P>
<P>
Notes: This was only the third time this year that Eaton gave up
more than four runs. He gave up five runs and seven hits in
four-plus innings. ... Grace, who spent the morning at Northwestern
Memorial Hospital after leaving Monday night's game with dizzy
spells, went 1-for-3 with two walks and two runs scored. ...
Tuesday was the 11th anniversary of the ''Dwight Smith Game,'' when
the Cubs rallied from a 9-0 deficit against Houston and won it 10-9
in 10 innings. Smith, who entered the game as a late-inning
defensive replacement, went 2-for-2, hitting the game-tying
sacrifice fly and the game-winning single.

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Spending The Same  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush spent more than $40 million
trying to reach voters through advertising and by mail and
telephone, nearly as much as Al Gore doled out for his campaign
during the presidential primaries, an analysis of campaign spending
records show.
</P>
<P>
   The study of campaign spending through July 31 shows that Bush,
the Republican presidential nominee, spent $43 million -- nearly
half of his record-shattering $100 million campaign treasury -- on
efforts to reach voters, including $25 million on television and
radio ads.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Gore spent just $14 million on similar voter-targeted
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign strategists say the spending spree should give Bush an
edge with voters for the fall campaign, when each candidate will be
limited to spending $67.6 million in federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are building brand familiarity,'' said former Rep. Bill
Paxon, R-N.Y., an adviser to Bush's campaign. ''It's very much like
automobile advertising. People don't focus on buying a car until
they buy a car but by then the advertising has had an impact on
their decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic media consultant Glenn Totten questioned whether
Bush got his money's worth. Recent national polls show him in a
dead heat with the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ''After spending $25 million on television and having spent some
of that money attacking both Mr. Gore's and President Clinton's
agenda, he should be enjoying a much more substantial lead,''
Totten said. ''If you can outspend your opponent by more than 2 to
1, you ought to be in awfully good shape, and he's not.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Campaign Study Group, a nonpartisan
organization that compiles and analyzes finance data for news
organizations, Gore spent $46 million on his successful primary
campaign through the end of July -- including $11 million on
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   And despite Bush's advantage in fund raising, Gore spent nearly
as much on campaign overhead, such as salaries and operating
expenses, as the Texas governor. The vice president spent $16
million on campaign operations compared to just $18 million for
Bush, the analysis showed.
</P>
<P>
   As the first major party nominee to shun federal matching funds
and spending limits for the primaries, Bush was allowed to spend as
much money as he could bring in.
</P>
<P>
   He raised $100 million and spent a record $93 million through
the end of July -- more than double Gore's expenditures. The vice
president's spending was restricted since he abided by federal
spending limits and received $15 million in federal campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also dwarfed Gore's spending on fund raising -- $18 million
to just $8 million for the vice president, the analysis showed.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the difference in spending was attributed to Bush's
efforts to reach voters.
</P>
<P>
   While running ads in Republican-leaning states like South
Carolina and New Hampshire, Bush also spent millions on commercials
in the battlegrounds of Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign spokesman Douglas Hattaway said he wasn't
concerned about Bush's spending.
</P>
<P>
   ''The message matters more than money,'' he said. ''Al Gore is
the one who's going to use our prosperity wisely to benefit
everyone, not just the few. Bush can run all the ads he wants but
he's wrong on the issues and can't hide that.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Storm Causes Flash Flooding  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TWENTYNINE PALMS, Calif. (AP) -- Heavy rain caused flash flooding
in desert areas of Southern California, as waves of water shoved
vehicles off roads and poured mud into nearby homes.
</P>
<P>
   Six people in the Yucca Valley area were rescued from vehicles
mired in the flooding, according to the San Bernardino County Fire
Department. No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Several desert thoroughfares were blocked when 3-foot waves
poured over shallow sections of the roads, and some cars were
partially buried in mud.
</P>
<P>
   Two teen-age girls returning home from the first day of school
were rescued by fellow motorists when they were swept away trying
to flee a car trapped in fast-moving floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I could get through it, but we got stuck. I tried to
put it in reverse, but we just went down that way,'' said driver
Jamie Hall, gesturing to a stream of water still pouring across the
road.
</P>
<P>
   Heaps of mud and large rocks remained on the roads when the
floods subsided late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nine houses were flooded with mud and water when flooding poured
through the hardpan desert.
</P>
<P>
   The storms brought the first measurable rain to downtown Los
Angeles since April 18.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-inch of rain fell in many areas of the San Fernando
Valley, with heaviest concentrations reported in Van Nuys and
Northridge, the National Weather Service said.

<HEADLINE> Missing Mexican Plane Found  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A plane from the Mexican attorney general's
office that disappeared on its way to pick up a drug suspect was
found Tuesday, crashed into a mountainside. The two pilots and a
technician on board were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found the wreckage of the King Air 300 aircraft 10
miles outside the Ensenada, Baja California, airport, the attorney
general's office said. The cause of the crash has not been
determined.
</P>
<P>
   The small plane left its base in the western border state of
Sonora early Saturday en route to Ensenada, on the Pacific coast,
to pick up the son of an alleged Mexican drug lieutenant and bring
him back to Mexico City. The son is also wanted on drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly an hour and a half after takeoff, the pilot asked the
Ensenada control tower to turn the runway lights on. The tower had
no further contact with the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Aldo Ismael Higuera Avila, was detained Friday on
drug charges by Ensenada police. The attorney general's office said
Tuesday that a judge had placed him under 90-day house arrest while
authorities build a case against him.
</P>
<P>
   Higuera Avila is the son of Ismael Higuera Guerrero, allegedly a
top lieutenant for the Tijuana-based Arellano Felix gang, one of
Mexico's most violent drug organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The son is accused of working with his father for the drug gang.
Higuera Avila was carrying a pistol and a false ID at the time of
his arrest, and tried to bribe police with $1,000, the attorney
general's office said.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Higuera is being held at a maximum security prison
pending trial on charges of aiding and financing drug trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Elusive Line Between Faith, Politics  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Joseph Lieberman's upfront expressions of
religious faith are making some constitutional activists and
religious scholars nervous. ''Parading piety,'' one calls his
words.
</P>
<P>
   But Al Gore's running mate is also drawing interest from an
unlikely source -- religious conservatives who have struggled
through enduring ridicule to inject God into politics and now
welcome the Democrat to the fight.
</P>
<P>
   More now than just a way of introducing himself to the nation,
Lieberman's invocations of God are threaded through his campaign,
and he's making no apologies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to keep on doing what I'm doing because it's the
American way,'' he said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's pushing it too far,'' said Martin E. Marty, emeritus
professor at the University of Chicago and a scholar who was
initially upbeat when Lieberman began talking about his Jewish
values in the campaign. Now Marty sees Lieberman ''parading
piety.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he says Lieberman is lending legitimacy to the right's
decades-long campaign to place religious values at the core of
politics -- a point precisely echoed by a leader of that effort.
</P>
<P>
   ''While some Republicans dislike the Lieberman selection
intently -- it endangers their victory -- for those who want to
advance the cultural issues, this selection is a home run,'' said
Paul M. Weyrich, president of the conservative Free Congress
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It validates cultural questions as the centerpiece of the
national political debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Schlafly, a figure from the early days of the Christian
conservative movement and still an influential activist, said she
in some sense welcomes what Lieberman is doing even though he is at
odds with her side on abortion, gay rights and more.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's an element in this country that treats religious
people like smokers,'' she said -- '''You can go down the dark alley
and hide in the doorway and have your cigarette, but for heaven's
sake don't be around the rest of us.'''
</P>
<P>
   But she added, ''It's clearly a double standard'' for people to
attack the right while not calling Lieberman to account.
</P>
<P>
   So far the toughest response has come from the Anti-Defamation
League, whose chairman and director joined in a statement saying an
emphasis on religion is ''inappropriate and even unsettling'' in
this religiously diverse society. The league fights anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Lieberman ''believes, as I do, in separation of church
and state. I believe in what he's saying. He's a man of great faith
and I knew that when I selected him.''
</P>
<P>
   Religious conservatives were not extending a wholehearted
welcome to Lieberman. Weyrich said he should have to explain how he
squares his support for abortion rights with his religious values.
</P>
<P>
   And Schlafly attributed Lieberman's conduct to a political
calculation by the Gore campaign that religion sells and helps
insulate Gore from President Clinton's moral failings.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Mark Fabiani said Lieberman is speaking as his
own man and laughed at any notion that his words arise from some
campaign strategy. ''We're not that organized,'' Fabiani said.
</P>
<P>
   John C. Green, a political scientist at the University of Akron,
says religion and politics have become increasingly intermixed.
''For most Americans,'' he said, Lieberman's religious discourse
''is in their comfort zone.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ''It's one of those things that should be stamped,
'Handle with Care.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman pitched a Medicare prescription drug plan as something
that serves the spirit of the Fifth Commandment, which demands that
mothers and fathers be honored. Celebrating the Clinton-Gore
administration's accomplishments, he said it was as if ''the Red
Sea finally parted and more Americans than ever before walked
through behind President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Comments like those troubled Green.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's potentially dangerous,'' he said. ''It connects, by
rhetoric and symbol, God's will with a particular policy
prescription.''
</P>
<P>
   Green's book, ''The Diminishing Divide,'' written with three
other authors attached to the Pew Research Center, points to polls
indicating that public acceptance of religion in politics has grown
since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lieberman's argument that religious voices have a very
important role to play in political debate is something that many
Americans will find quite plausible,'' Green said. What's unusual
is for a Democrat to be presenting that argument, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Green and Marty agree that Lieberman is being judged differently
than religious conservatives but said a double standard is in some
ways understandable: Christian conservatives outnumber Jews and
seek more profound changes in government than Lieberman has
advocated.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has used some of the language more identified with
conservative evangelicals, including his contention that the
Constitution does not demand ''freedom from religion,'' but only
freedom ''of'' religion.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has gone way beyond what is appropriate for the political
season,'' said Barry Lynn, head of Americans United for Separation
of Church and State.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your ability to understand Scripture may be appropriate in
Iran,'' he said, ''but it sure is not appropriate here.''

<HEADLINE> Sports writer Lundquist dies at 86  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORT ORANGE, Fla. (AP) - Carl Lundquist, a longtime sports
writer for United Press, died Saturday night at a hospice in Port
Orange, Fla. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   He contributed a column to College and Pro Football for 20
years, and was a frequent contributor to The Sporting News before
retiring in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, he wrote ''United We Stand,'' a history of United Press
and its successor, United Press International, and was inducted
into the Brooklyn Dodgers Hall of Fame and Babe Ruth Baseball Hall
of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Lundquist was born on Oct. 24, 1913, in Kansas City, Mo., and in
1929 became a reporter for the Kansas City Journal-Post, covering
high school sports. He moved to the Kansas City Grover's Telegram
from 1931-37, then joined UP in its Kansas City bureau in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   In 1943, he moved to New York and was a baseball and football
editor through 1956. Lundquist, who covered his first World Series
in 1942, was the main lead writer for UP at the World Series from
1947-55, competing with Jack Hand of The Associated Press and Bob
Considine of International News Service.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, Lundquist moved to Columbus, Ohio, to become the public
relations director of the National Association of Professional
Baseball Leagues, the governing body of the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Lundquist returned to New York in 1963, getting involved with
advertising and promotions with the Yankees and Mets. In 1967 and
'68, he handled publicity for the Generals, New York's first team
in the North American Soccer League.
</P>
<P>
   From 1985-92, he handled public relations for the New York State
Games for the Physically Challenged.
</P>
<P>
   Lundquist is survived by a daughter, Susan; son, Richard; seven
grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral will be Saturday at the Westminster by the Sea
Presbyterian Church in Daytona Beach Shores. There will be a
memorial service on Long Island on Oct. 21, according to Marty
Appel, former public relations director of the New York Yankees.

<HEADLINE> Angels 9, Blue Jays 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Darin Erstad went 3-for-5 to reach 200
hits faster than any player in 65 years as the Anaheim Angels
rallied from a four-run deficit to beat the Toronto Blue Jays 9-4
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels trailed 4-0 before Troy Glaus hit a three-run homer
in the fourth inning and Mo Vaughn tied it with a solo shot in the
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim broke it open with four runs in the sixth, capped by
Erstad's two-run single. Erstad reached 200 hits in Anaheim's 132nd
game -- the fastest since the Cardinals' Ducky Medwick did it in 131
games in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Carpenter (9-11) issued a one-out walk to Glaus, who
scored on Kennedy's line-drive double past the glove of first
baseman Carlos Delgado.
</P>
<P>
   Bengie Molina greeted Paul Quantrill with an RBI single. Kevin
Stocker followed with a double and Erstad hit a two-run single off
Mark Guthrie to make it 8-4.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Holtz (2-2) retired Dave Martinez with the bases loaded --
the only batter he faced -- to end the sixth for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, starting for the first time since being demoted to
the bullpen on Aug. 3, allowed six runs and six hits in 5 1-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus' 38th homer put him within one of the club record Reggie
Jackson set in 1982. Vaughn's 32nd home run left him needing one
RBI to reach the 100 mark for the sixth time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   The first inning was an eventful one for the Blue Jays, in terms
of milestones. Dave Martinez had an RBI single that gave him at
least one hit in all 19 games he has played for Toronto since the
Aug. 5 trade from Texas -- and equaled the longest hitting streak of
his career.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado followed with a double for his 400th career extra-base
hit and 88th this season, breaking the club record set last year by
Shawn Green.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto increased its margin to 4-0 in the third with five
consecutive one-out hits to chase Scott Karl, who allowed four runs
and nine hits in 2 1-3 innings of his Angels debut.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Erstad is the fastest AL player to reach 200 since Al
Simmons of the Philadelphia A's did it in 125 games in 1925. ...
The Angels won for the 12th time after trailing by at least three
runs. ... The Blue Jays lead the majors with 217 homers and need
four more to tie the club record. They are 6-18 when they don't
homer. ... Martinez is the first player in Toronto history to hit
safely in his first 19 games with the club.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Lieberman To Confront Bush  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Keeping the focus on health care,
Democrats Al Gore and Joseph Lieberman were demanding that
Republican rival George W. Bush say what he is willing to do to
save Medicare while promoting their own $400 billion bailout of the
program.
</P>
<P>
   ''Medicare is a lifeline for millions of seniors and their
families,'' Gore said in remarks prepared for delivery Wednesday at
a town hall meeting. ''You ought to know what both sides are
proposing to do to preserve it and make it strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides noted that Bush has spoken approvingly of a Medicare
commission that has recommended changes, some controversial, to
shore up the health care program for the nation's elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he will not support many of the panel's
recommendations, which include raising the eligibility age for
Medicare from 65 to 67, and increasing premiums and copayments.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not going to support the commission's recommendations to
raise the eligibility,'' he said. ''I am not going to support the
commission's proposal to raise premiums and raise copayments.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides were careful to note that Bush has put no money in his
budget for Medicare, and said Bush should be asked to explain how
he would keep the system from running out of money.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gore's proposed $400 billion bailout, Medicare would be
taken off-budget or put into a ''lock box,'' where its surpluses
could not be spent for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has spoken approvingly of the commission's report, but has
not specifically endorsed it.
</P>
<P>
   He also has praised as ''a blueprint for success'' a proposal by
Sens. John Breaux, D-La., and Bill Frist, R-Tenn., which does not
seek to raise the eligibility age.
</P>
<P>
   He is expected next Tuesday to lay out details of his plan to
add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman, meanwhile, will have to be careful on the
issue. Lieberman, a senator from Connecticut, voted in 1997 to
raise the eligibility age to 67. But on issues where the two
differ, Lieberman has said he will defer to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Blasting Bush for being vague on policy details is Gore's theme
this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to change Medicare to improve and update it,'' he
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He reminded Bush that there was still time to offer a health
care agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is still time, even before Labor Day, to offer these
specifics,'' Gore told voters before he and Lieberman headed for a
reunion in the Pacific Northwest. ''It's all about you. You deserve
a full discussion of all the issues that need to be addressed.''

<HEADLINE> Mo. Executes Killer of Three  </HEADLINE>
By JIM SALTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   POTOSI, Mo. (AP) -- A man was executed by injection early
Wednesday for killing a woman and her two sons during a 1992
robbery because he feared the family would identify him.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Gary Lee Roll and two accomplices went to the
Scheper's Cape Girardeau home in southeast Missouri early Aug. 9,
1992, with the intent to commit robbery. Sherry Scheper, 47, was
beaten to death with a gun; Randy, 17, was shot and killed; and
Curtis, 22, was stabbed to death.
</P>
<P>
   The men then left with 12 plastic sandwich-sized bags full of
marijuana and $214 in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The slaying went unsolved for several weeks until. However, one
of the accomplices began to fear that Roll might harm him, too. So
he wore a tape recorder during a conversation with Roll. On the
tape, Roll admitted to the crime, saying he killed the Schepers
because ''they knew everybody ... and I figured then they know me
...''
</P>
<P>
   The accomplice gave the tape to a friend, who turned it over to
police. Roll and the teens were arrested in November 1992. Roll
later pleaded guilty to all three slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Roll, 47, said in an interview that constant pain caused by a
botched oral surgery 18 years ago led him to a life of drugs and
crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''It affected my life so much,'' Roll said. ''It changed me.''
</P>
<P>
   He was the third inmate executed in Missouri this year and the
44th since the death penalty was reinstated in 1989. Gov. Mel
Carnahan had denied his request for clemency late Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Visit Colombia  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's trip to Colombia is aimed
at propping up the nation's fight against drugs and insurgents, yet
his itinerary includes sightseeing in a scenic Caribbean port city
far from the violence and poppy and coca fields that yield most the
cocaine and heroin used in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   With $1.3 billion in U.S. aid in his pocket, Clinton was
traveling to South America on Wednesday to back Colombian President
Andres Pastrana's $7.5 billion initiative to ease the
narco-traffickers' grip on his nation, make peace with insurgents
financed by drug profits, rev up the economy and strengthen the
justice system.
</P>
<P>
   ''Colombia's democracy is under attack,'' Clinton said in an
address televised to Colombians on the eve of his visit. ''Profits
from the drug trade fund civil conflict. Powerful forces make their
own law, and you face danger every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was spending all his time in Cartagena, a 467-year-old
coastal city with churches, monasteries and shaded plazas. Situated
on the northern tip of Colombia, Cartagena is several hundred miles
from the nation's capital, Bogota, and farther still from the
southern sections of the country where guerillas and paramilitary
groups rule.
</P>
<P>
   His stay is short partly because of security concerns in a
nation the State Department calls one of the most violent in the
world. Ninety percent of the cocaine in the U.S. market and
two-thirds of the heroin on the East Coast comes from Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit includes a tour of the Port of Cartagena where
he will be briefed on drug-interdiction efforts, meet with
Colombian National Police and talk with widows of police officers
who have been killed in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he will go to a low-income neighborhood to tour a Casa de
Justicia, one of 20 centers funded by the U.S. Agency for
International Development that gives Colombia's poor greater access
to the justice system. People can walk into these centers and see
ombudsmen, social workers, public defenders, mediators and others
who can help them resolve civil and criminal matters.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to bolster law and order in a country overrun by
lawlessness.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana himself was kidnapped by the Medellin drug cartel in
the late 1980s and freed in a dramatic rescue. But besides fighting
drug traffickers, the one-time mayor of Bogota and former fellow at
Harvard University is trying to nudge the nation out of recession.
</P>
<P>
   Economic growth declined 3.5 percent in 1999, although it was up
by 2.2 percent in the first quarter of this year. Unemployment
reached 20 percent in mid-1999, but is on the decline.
</P>
<P>
   Elected on a peace platform, Pastrana also is trying to
negotiate an end to hostilities with Marxist guerillas and
right-wing paramilitary groups. In conflict with the state for 36
years, both engage in kidnapping and other acts of violence against
citizens, foreigners, the government and commercial installations,
such as oil pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very tough place,'' said Sandy Berger, Clinton's
national security adviser. ''I think we can either ... help
Colombia in its effort to deal with that problem, or stand back and
let Colombian democracy collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. part of Pastrana's ''Plan Colombia'' is aimed at
helping the Colombian military take control of cocaine-producing
regions held by the guerrillas and paramilitary groups. The U.S.
assistance includes funds for 60 combat helicopters and training
for the Colombian military, plus money for building schoolrooms,
water systems and roads, judicial reform and protecting human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Clinton waived conditions for the release of the U.S.
aid that are aimed at overcoming military abuses and bringing human
rights violators to justice. The decision prompted protests from
human rights groups and some lawmakers, including Sen. Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt. ''There will be tough questions when they come back to
Congress this fall for the next installment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is providing the Blackhawk and Huey
helicopters and training to support a military push into Southern
jungles where guerillas and the militias take payoffs to protect
peasant drug plots and traffickers' airstrips and labs.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials insist that Washington is not being embroiled in
a Vietnam-style civil conflict. They say, however, that
U.S.-trained troops and equipment will be used against guerrillas
who try to block efforts to eradicate drug crops and destroy labs.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rios, a commander of the most powerful guerrilla group
known as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, has vowed to
resist what he calls ''U.S. aggression.''

<HEADLINE> Cheney Avoids Religion Subject  </HEADLINE>
By GINA HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Dick Cheney wasn't using his Bible Belt
tour to talk about faith, discussing instead another popular issue
in the South -- the military.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential nominee was making stops Wednesday
in North Carolina and Georgia to talk about defense spending and
his concerns that the military is overstretched.
</P>
<P>
   In Charlotte, N.C., the former defense secretary was making a
luncheon speech before discussing military problems at an
international studies center in Atlanta. His final stop on a
five-state sweep was to be Florida on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Before attending a fund-raiser Tuesday night in Jackson, Cheney
said the armed forces have been given too many duties and suffered
from low retention rates, lack of housing and poor equipment
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to go thoroughly scrub those commitments and look for
ways to ease some of the burden on the troops,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said he would not support more base closures, a concern
in Mississippi, where pilots train in Columbus and Meridian. The
military has more than 21,500 uniformed and civilian personnel
scattered across 12 Mississippi communities. The largest private
employer is Ingalls Shipbuilding, which builds vessels for the
Navy.
</P>
<P>
   The base closing process has gone about as far as it can because
the Clinton administration ''lost the trust of Congress'' with the
last round of closings, Cheney said. He criticized Clinton's
decision during his 1996 re-election campaign to allow private
contractors to assume work at some bases recommended for closure by
a nonpartisan commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had one more round of base closings and Bill Clinton
played fast and loose with the procedure and kept open a couple of
places in California that the commission had said to close,'' he
said. ''Congress then lost all confidence that the process would be
run in a fair and impartial fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney and his wife Lynne spent Tuesday night in Jackson, where
they celebrated their 36th wedding anniversary. ''I can't think of
a better place to spend it than Mississippi,'' he told several
hundred people who greeted the couple at the local airport.
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of religion, the former Wyoming congressman told
reporters before the Jackson fund-raiser that although he was
raised in a religious family ''I also as a matter of course
throughout my career have not talked a lot about my faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic vice presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman said
earlier this week that America ''is the most religious country in
the world and sometimes we try to stifle that fact or hide it.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican businessman Mike Marsh of Brandon said he appreciated
Cheney's approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very apprehensive about somebody who makes a big deal out
of their religion,'' Marsh said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans To Reopen Peace Quest  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a deadline closing in, President Clinton
will make a fresh attempt next week to reopen summit talks with
Israel and the Palestinians and try to mediate a settlement on
Jerusalem's future and the shape of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   The odds against him appear long. A senior U.S. official
involved in the drive told The Associated Press on Tuesday that at
this point the two sides were too far apart on the issues to call
another summit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans separate meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat against the backdrop of
the United Nations' Millennium Summit, which will bring scores of
government heads to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and the Palestinians have set a Sept. 13 deadline for
settlement of their half-century-old dispute. Arafat has said he
would declare Palestinian statehood if there is no accord.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's immediate aim is to set up a three-way session; his
overall goal is the wide-ranging agreement that appeared to be
taking shape last month at Camp David, in Maryland's Catoctin
Mountains, but fizzled mostly over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's too early to speak of a three-way summit,'' Saeb Erekat,
the top Palestinian negotiator, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are instructions from President Arafat to us to exert
every effort for an agreement,'' he said. ''We want peace, but not
at any price.''
</P>
<P>
   At the summit, Arafat demanded Palestinian sovereignty over the
eastern part of Jerusalem, held by Israel since Jordanian troops
were expelled in the 1967 Six-Day War. He would make it the capital
of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Barak offered the Palestinians administrative control over some
neighborhoods inside the city and in suburbs, as well as most of
the West Bank for a state. But the talks collapsed over Jerusalem
and over Palestinian demands that Israel grant hundreds of
thousands of Palestinian refugees the right to resettle in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In a move to make headway, Clinton's Middle East envoy, Dennis
Ross, is drafting a paper to summarize points of near-agreement at
Camp David, Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said Tuesday in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on Israel radio, he described the paper as a catalogue
of U.S. impressions and summations of the Camp David discussions.
Then, the summary will be put to Israel and the Palestinians for
their comments.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Palestinians will relate properly to this catalogue,
then we are in a positive game,'' Ben-Ami said. ''If their comment
will be entirely negative, it won't work.''
</P>
<P>
   After a 90-minute meeting Tuesday in Cairo, Clinton and Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak committed themselves to finding a solution
but indicated no breakthrough was near.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said the session was
''good, positive and important.''
</P>
<P>
   Moussa said Clinton brought no new plan, ''but there are ways
and proposals and ideas'' that could help Israel and the
Palestinians move closer together in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   ''But this will require a great effort,'' Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
   Ross then briefed Barak in Jerusalem on the Clinton-Mubarak
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued by Barak's office afterward said the prime
minister estimated chances of reaching an agreement with the
Palestinians as ''50-50,'' an assessment he has made before.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiator Erekat said the gap between the two sides
remained wide.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Israelis are accusing us of backsliding and not being
flexible, then they say they are proposing new ideas and that this
has brought progress,'' he said. ''But that is not true.''

Rebels Threaten To Kill American Hostage
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Muslim rebels in the Philippines threatened
Tuesday to kill an American man they have kidnapped unless the United States
accepts their demands. Jeffrey Craig Edwards Schilling, of Oakland, Calif., was
seized Monday by a faction of the Abu Sayyaf rebel group, which this week
released six other Western hostages in return for a reported $6 million ransom
but was still holding 18 other captives. But the faction holding Schilling
insisted the prospect of more ransom was not behind the latest kidnapping. In
past abductions, the faction has demanded the release of Muslim militants jailed
in the United States for the World Trade Center bombing and other planned
attacks.

Clinton: Disbarment Too Harsh
</SUBHEAD>

   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- President Clinton said Tuesday he should not be
disbarred over his testimony in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case, telling
a state judge that losing his law license is too harsh a penalty. In a five-page
response to a complaint filed by the Arkansas Supreme Court Committee on
Professional Conduct, the president said that he would not receive such a stiff

Aid Offered to Drought-Stricken Texas

   BOYD, Texas (AP) -- Gazing across a field of shrunken yellow watermelons on
withered vines, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman Tuesday promised federal aid
to four more counties in drought-stricken north Texas. Glickman's visit marked
the 60th consecutive day without measurable rainfall in north Texas, where crops
are parched and reservoirs are drying up. The previous record was 58 days, set
in 1934 and 1950. ''These folks are really hurting,'' he said. ''I don't like to
be here on a day setting records -- not these kinds of records, anyway.''
Glickman has previously declared 153 Texas counties either primary or contiguous
agricultural disaster areas.

Mo. Executes Killer of Three

   POTOSI, Mo. (AP) -- A man was executed by injection early Wednesday for
killing a woman and her two sons during a 1992 robbery because he feared the
family would identify him. Prosecutors said Roll and two accomplices went to the
Scheper's Cape Girardeau home in southeast Missouri early Aug. 9, 1992, with the
intent to commit robbery. Sherry Scheper, 47, was beaten to death with a gun;
Randy, 17, was shot and killed; and Curtis, 22, was stabbed to death. The men
then left with 12 plastic sandwich-sized bags full of marijuana and $214 in
cash.

Calif. Storm Causes Flash Flooding
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TWENTYNINE PALMS, Calif. (AP) -- Heavy rain caused flash flooding in desert
areas of Southern California, as waves of water shoved vehicles off roads and
poured mud into nearby homes. Six people in the Yucca Valley area were rescued
from vehicles mired in the flooding, according to the San Bernardino County Fire
Department. No one was injured. Several desert thoroughfares were blocked when
3-foot waves poured over shallow sections of the roads, and some cars were
partially buried in mud. Two teen-age girls returning home from the first day of
school were rescued by fellow motorists when they were swept away trying to flee
a car trapped in fast-moving floodwaters.

Eric Young led off the bottom of the 13th with a double off Trevor Hoffman
(4-6). Damian Jackson, who had just moved to left field from second, misjudged
the ball and slipped in the grass as he tried to move. Young took third on Gary
Matthews Jr.'s sacrifice, and the Padres loaded the bases with intentional walks
to Sammy Sosa and Mark Grace. That brought up Gutierrez, who lofted a liner to
center. Mike Darr fielded it, but Young beat the throw home.

<HEADLINE> E. Timor Celebrates Independence  </HEADLINE>
By HEATHER PATERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor (AP) -- East Timor marked the first anniversary
of its historic independence ballot Wednesday, with tearful prayers
for those killed in the long fight for independence and calls for
forgiveness for the Indonesian generals held responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people walked or rode in U.N. trucks and motorbikes
to a cathedral in Dili, East Timor's capital, to give thanks for
their freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ''We pray for the heroes who died for our liberation,'' Bishop
Carlos Belo, the territory's spiritual leader and Nobel Peace
laureate, told the teary-eyed congregation at a special Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Belo urged the East Timorese to put the years of violence behind
them and look to the future.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must forgive our enemies, the Indonesian generals, the
autonomy leaders, those who support integration (with Indonesia)
and the militia commanders,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, for many it was a time to remember their sad and bloody
past.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's military invaded the former Portuguese colony in
1975. About 200,000 lives were lost to disease, famine and military
repression before the Aug. 30, 1999, ballot in which East Timorese
voted overwhelmingly for independence.
</P>
<P>
   The result infuriated pro-Indonesian militias, which went on a
rampage. Hundreds of people were killed and most of the territory's
buildings were damaged or burned. The violence and destruction came
to a halt after international peacekeepers arrived in September.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations, which is administering East Timor during its
transition to independence, has started to rebuild. Schools have
been reopened and houses constructed. A democratic government is
being set up.
</P>
<P>
   But even the venue for Wednesday's service had ties to the past.
The whitewashed Dili Cathedral was built by Indonesia's former
dictator Suharto, who had ordered the 1975 invasion, in a failed
attempt to win the hearts of the mainly Catholic Timorese.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today we celebrate our freedom,'' Juanzho Teles, a member of
the congregation, said as the cathedral bells tolled. ''But we also
remember those who were killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands gathered at Dili's Santa Cruz cemetery, the scene of a
1991 massacre that focused attention on the brutality of Indonesian
rule. They placed floral wreaths and pink and white bougainvillea
petals around a simple black steel cross.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are at the resting place of those who gave their lives so
that East Timor can be free,'' said Jose Ramos-Horta, another Nobel
laureate. ''Those who survived have the burden of building a better
East Timor, a country that is worth the sacrifice of so many.''
</P>
<P>
   Heavily armed peacekeepers stood guard amid fears that militia
groups might try to disrupt anniversary celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. peacekeepers and militiamen exchanged gunfire Tuesday near
the border with Indonesian West Timor, the latest in a series of
recent clashes that have killed two peacekeepers and several
militiamen.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations warned that increasing militia attacks appear
to be a coordinated attempt to undermine the transition to
independence and discredit the U.N. administration.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Secretary-General Hedi Annabi told Security Council
members they should prepare for a worst-case scenario in which the
militias may try to destabilize East Timor through ''offensive
guerrilla-style operations'' against civilians and U.N. troops.
</P>
<P>
   Annabi suggested that Indonesian forces, implicated in the 1999
violence, may have at least allowed the recent attacks to occur,
noting that some militia members were found with army uniforms and
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's U.N. Ambassador Markarim Wibisono said army uniforms
did not imply army involvement, noting ''such material can be
easily acquired on the black market.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Denies Visa to Cuban Diplomat  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The president of Cuba's National Assembly says
the Clinton administration, by denying him a visa to attend an
international conference in New York, has shown contempt for him
and the gathering of parliamentarians he was to join.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also is violating its obligations to the
United Nations and to the Inter-Parliamentary Union by keeping him
from attending a four-day meeting beginning today of the presiding
officers of the group, the Cuban legislator, Ricardo Alarcon, said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, anticipating rejection of his visa application,
Alarcon wrote Anders Johnsson, the Inter-Parliamentary Union's
secretary-general, to request a response to the U.S. action.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible, the Cuban legislator said, ''to ignore the
contempt and lack of respect for our organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Two deputies in the Cuban assembly will be permitted to attend,
a U.S. official told The Associated Press on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 140 countries are expected to send delegations,
including many legislative leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Alarcon's visa was rejected under the provisions of a 1985
presidential proclamation that bars entry to the United States if
the visit is considered contrary to U.S. interests, said two U.S.
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Alarcon's personal assistant, Alberto Gonzalez Rodriguez, also
was denied a visa.
</P>
<P>
   However, visas were approved for assembly deputies Ramon Pez
Ferro and Ada Martinez. They are not senior Cuban officials and
therefore were considered qualified for entry under the
proclamation, one of the U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department spokesman, Philip Reeker, declined to
identify which Cubans were denied visas and which were receiving
them. He said he was bound by the ''confidentiality'' of the visa
process.
</P>
<P>
   However, Reeker confirmed that ''we have authorized issuance of
visas to some Cuban officials who applied to travel to this
interparliamentary Union event'' and ''determined not to issue
visas to some people that had applied.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Najma Heptulla, president of the
Inter-Parliamentary Council, which is the overseeing body of the
Inter-Parliamentary Union, called the U.S. decision to bar Alarcon
unfortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a conference of presiding officers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Heptulla said the United States, meanwhile, had not paid its
dues ''and we are working on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuba and the United States have limited diplomatic relations,
but Cuban officials have been permitted to travel here to attend
U.N. meetings in New York and to staff the small Cuban diplomatic
mission in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The parliamentary group is not a U.N. organization and therefore
the United States is not required by agreements with the United
Nations to issue visas to individuals attending the group's events
in News York, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Alarcon is scheduled to be the host of a formal
session of the parliamentary union in Havana in April.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Monday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright accused Cuba
of arbitrarily denying exit permits to Cubans with U.S. visas,
thereby separating families and forcing would-be immigrants to
attempt high-risk escapes by boat.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Albright said Cuba's actions violated agreements
with the United States, international standards and ''fundamental
human decency.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she ordered a formal protest lodged with Cuba's
diplomatic office in Washington. ''The government of Cuba is
increasingly obstructing the safe, legal and orderly migration of
individuals from Cuba,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Already-bumpy relations with Cuba declined amid a protracted and
touchy U.S. dispute with Cuban-Americans last spring over
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, the only survivor of a November boat
passage to Miami that also killed his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Elian returned to Cuba with his father June 28, after a lengthy
legal battle with emigre relatives in Florida. The Cuban government
cited the incident in June when it indefinitely suspended
immigration negotiations with the United States.

Rebels Threaten To Kill American

<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- The Philippine government is
considering a tougher approach toward Muslim rebels after they
kidnapped an American man and threatened to kill him, an official
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Sayyaf rebels announced Tuesday they had abducted Jeffrey
Schilling of Oakland, California. The extremist group is still
holding 18 other hostages on southern Jolo island after releasing
six Westerners earlier this week for a reported $6 million
bankrolled by Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have warned that the large ransom payment will encourage
more kidnappings in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot go on like this,'' said presidential Executive
Secretary Ronaldo Zamora. ''Otherwise we will be doing exactly what
those against ransom have been saying right from the beginning. We
are just setting ourselves up for more problems in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   In a radio interview, rebel spokesman Abu Sabaya said the
guerrillas are willing to begin negotiations with U.S. Embassy
officials on Thursday for Schilling's release. He demanded that
representatives of North Korea, China, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Libya
take part in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Sabaya said Tuesday that the rebels would announce their demands
in three days and would kill Schilling if the United States did not
accept them.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling is being held by the same hard-line Abu Sayyaf faction
that kidnapped about 50 schoolchildren and teachers in March on
neighboring Basilan island. The group beheaded two teachers after
the United States ignored their demand for the release of several
Arab terrorists held in U.S. jails.
</P>
<P>
   Sabaya said the rebels believe Schilling is a CIA agent because
he had introduced himself as a Muslim convert but knew little about
Islam.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Consul General John Caulfield called the allegation
''ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This individual is a completely innocent person who has been
unjustifiably seized,'' he said. ''We want to see his immediate
release and we look to the Philippine government to do everything
possible to secure that.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling arrived in the Philippines on March 8 and has been
living with his Muslim Filipino girlfriend, Ivi V. Osani, in
southern Zamboanga city.
</P>
<P>
   Osani's mother, Aida Ajijol, said Osani and Abu Sayyaf spokesman
Sabaya are second cousins. Sabaya had invited the couple to visit
the rebels' camp on Jolo, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Oakland, Schilling's mother, Carol, said her son went to
visit the Philippines in March partly because of a longtime
interest in the region but stayed after he fell in love with Osani.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried to get him out of the country three times but he
didn't come out. He was too much in love,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had looked forward to him coming home, and now I'm just
scared,'' she said, her voice trembling and her eyes rimmed red.
''I don't know what's going to happen now. I'm just hoping
everybody will pray for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Zamora said President Joseph Estrada would decide later
Wednesday on the government's response to Schilling's abduction.
</P>
<P>
   Zamora said the government had been forced to negotiate with the
Abu Sayyaf after they abducted 21 people, mostly foreigners, in
April because of pressure from their governments for a nonmilitary
solution.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, he said, the United States has taken a more
aggressive approach toward international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the United States is considering military action,
Caulfield replied: ''I am not going to speculate on any area like
that.''

<HEADLINE> Postal Service Facing a Loss  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After five years in the black, the Postal
Service may be facing a loss in the fiscal year that ends next
month.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not optimistic. Right now, our cash flow is down,''
Postmaster General William Henderson said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson said the agency could be in the red as much as $300
million when the books are tallied at the end of September.
</P>
<P>
   His comments came in an interview after the monthly meeting of
the postal board of governors.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson said the agency has faced a series of unexpected
costs. At the same time, there has been a decline in the volume of
first-class mail.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, however, he said advertising mail has
rebounded. It had dropped last year as enthusiasm grew for online
Internet sales, Henderson said, but that market has not expanded as
fast as businesses had expected and they have returned to postal
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   He reported a 5 percent growth in advertising mail this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, we're making money,'' he explained. The outcome of
the fiscal year ''depends on how far down our revenue falls this
last quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm pessimistic,'' he said. ''I'd love to be surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Internet usage by consumers was hurting the Postal
Service's bottom line, Henderson said the decline was not a
''diversion'' to other types of communication. There was a
diversion last year in advertising mail, he admitted, noting that
is now coming back.
</P>
<P>
   This quarter, which ends Sept. 30, usually is a weak one for the
post office, a lull before the heavy flow of pre-Christmas catalogs
and holiday cards and letters.
</P>
<P>
   The post office expects revenue of about $65 billion for the
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   While the post office made a profit in fiscal in 1995 and every
year since, surpluses have been shrinking as costs increased.
Profits have been used on new equipment, modernization, postponing
rate increases and reducing accumulated losses. The post office
still carries a $3.5 billion accumulated deficit, built up over
many years of operating in the red.
</P>
<P>
   A 1-cent rate increase took effect in January 1999, and the
agency has applied for another penny increase -- to 34 cents for
first-class mail -- to take effect next January.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the plan had been to finish this fiscal year about
$100 million in the black, but Henderson said a series of added
costs have forced the agency to cut back spending to make ends
meet. He cited an extra $150 million for workers' compensation
costs, $350 million in increased gasoline costs, $400 million
awarded to letter carriers through arbitration and a revenue
shortfall of more than $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring Henderson said in a speech that he was seeking to
make about $4 billion in savings at the agency by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The post office is starting negotiations with several of its
major unions, including clerks, mail handlers and rural carriers,
and must factor increased labor costs into its future planning.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service last showed a loss in 1994, when it was $913
million in the red. That was its fifth straight year of red ink.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress established the Postal Service as a
semi-independent federal agency in 1971, it phased out taxpayer
subsidies and instructed managers to operate it like a business
with a goal of breaking even over time.

<HEADLINE> Police Probe Japan Milk Maker  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Police on Wednesday raided the Tokyo headquarters
of Japan's largest dairy products maker, which is under
investigation for selling bacteria-tainted milk that caused a
massive food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also searched Snow Brand Milk Products Co.'s
regional main office in Osaka on suspicion of professional
negligence. No arrests were made.
</P>
<P>
   Both raids were being conducted by Osaka investigators, police
said. Most of the 14,800 people sickened in the June food poisoning
live in Osaka, about 254 miles west of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The Snow Brand case and a chain of other recent contamination of
food with bugs, broken pieces of plastic and other objects have
triggered a national food scare and loss of public trust in Japan's
food industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Snow Brand illnesses were initially blamed on staph bacteria
in a production-line valve for lowfat milk at the Osaka plant,
which was closed down indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Later, local government and company officials said it may have
been caused by staph bacteria toxins in powdered milk produced at
another Snow Brand factory on the northern island of Hokkaido but
used at the Osaka plant to make milk products.
</P>
<P>
   The powdered milk was not sold separately on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Police suspect Snow Brand failed to take necessary sanitary
measures at its plants resulting in the food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   Snow Brand's president has resigned. No company officials have
been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ''We apologize for the trouble we have caused to so many
people,'' Snow Brand said in a statement, repeating earlier
apologies. ''We will cooperate in the investigation in any way we
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspections conducted by Health and Welfare Ministry officials
found that that Snow Brand had also recycled milk returned from
stores, including some with expired expiration dates for freshness.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Snow Brand spokesman Joji Tsugai said the
company's own internal probe has discovered that the Hokkaido plant
workers were routinely printing false production dates in an
attempt to get rid of months-old excess inventory.
</P>
<P>
   At least 70 bags of powdered milk produced in April, which
investigators suspected of containing the toxic bacteria, were
later given July production dates, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The food poisoning caused Snow Brand to recall products and many
supermarkets stopped carrying anything made by the company.

<HEADLINE> Hispanic, Asian Population Booming  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   DORAVILLE, Ga. (AP) -- Still leery of his near-flawless English,
Jose Quintana is among an increasing number of Hispanics drawn to
this Atlanta suburb by a tight community of helpful immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, 17 people can come here together, live together,
look out for each other. We help each other,'' said Quintana, a
Salvadorean who moved to Georgia six months ago from Rochester,
N.Y., to live with his sister. ''No English? They'll help you. It's
a community.''
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau estimates released Wednesday show that increases
in the nation's two fastest-growing minority populations --
Hispanics and Asians -- are beginning to spur growth in
nontraditional immigrant destinations such as northern Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Between July 1, 1990, and July 1, 1999, the nation's Asian and
Pacific Islander population grew 43 percent to 10.8 million, and
the Hispanic population grew 38.8 percent to 31.3 million, the
Census estimates show. These are the last such estimates to be
released before detailed Census 2000 results come out next year.
</P>
<P>
   California, Texas and New York -- the three most populous states
-- still have the highest numbers of minorities, but Nevada, Georgia
and North Carolina experienced the biggest percent increases,
Census analyst Larry Sink said.
</P>
<P>
   In northern Georgia, a construction boom along with abundant
jobs at poultry processing and carpet-making plants have caused
Hispanic immigration to surge.
</P>
<P>
   Doraville sits on the edge of Gwinnett County, which saw its
Hispanic population surge 215.6 percent in the 90s to 26,731.
Another metro Atlanta county, Cobb, had a 158.9 percent jump to
24,350. Similar increases were seen among Asians, up 180.7 percent
to 28,793 in Gwinnett and up 135.7 percent to 18,758 in Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the white population increased 7.3 percent between
1990 and 1999 to 224.6 million. Blacks remained the largest
minority group, experiencing a 13.8 percent spike during the same
period to 34.8 million, while the American Indian and Alaska Native
population increased 15.5 percent to 2.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada's 50 percent population growth led all states during the
'90s. Its Asian population rose 123.7 percent to 88,208, the
largest such increase in the nation, while its Hispanic population
rose 144.6 percent to 304,364. Hispanics can be of any race.
</P>
<P>
   California had the biggest Hispanic population, with 10.4
million. Arkansas, meanwhile, had the largest percentage growth
among Hispanics, increasing 170.3 percent to 53,729 in the 90s.
</P>
<P>
   New jobs in construction, food processing and textile industries
make Georgia attractive to immigrants, said Robert Giacomini,
director of research for the state's data center.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews Tuesday, many Atlanta-area immigrants said an
abundance of jobs with decent wages had lured them to one of the
country's fastest-growing cities. Some, including Fernando Lopez,
said they moved from Texas after hearing friends say that
construction work paid better in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the money,'' said Lopez, rubbing his fingers together to
signify cash, who moved to suburban Atlanta last year from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The population changes can be seen in small ways: It's possible,
for example, to buy a daily Chinese newspaper at the Buford Highway
Farmers Market, a Korean-owned grocery with a majority Hispanic
clientele.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Yan, a manager of the Farmers Market, said Koreans flock
to Gwinnett County for the same reason so many others have moved to
Atlanta in recent years -- ''a lot of trees, fresh air and the
schools are OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Graciela Lopez Blancarte moved to Norcross, a neighboring
Gwinnett County suburb, from Mexico two years ago looking for work.
She doesn't speak English, but cleans houses and has found no
shortage of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good place to live,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Israelis Ready To Test 'Video Pill'  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA BLIJDENSTEIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- An Israeli company is ready to start testing
its ''video pill'' -- a tiny video camera that monitors human
intestines -- on patients.
</P>
<P>
   The M2A Swallowable Imaging Capsule transmits two images a
second. Designers for Given Imaging used their training in Israel's
military industries to design the two chips -- a sensor and a
transmitter -- that are the basis of the device.
</P>
<P>
   The video-quality images are picked up by a Walkman-sized
receiver worn on a belt around the waist, and are then loaded onto
a hard disk and examined by a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The capsule, which contains a miniature video camera, a battery,
a tiny light and a transmitter, passed preliminary U.S. Food and
Drug Administration tests on animals and healthy volunteers. Given
Imaging executives in Jerusalem said Monday that led to the
decision to launch clinical testing next month.
</P>
<P>
   FDA spokeswoman Sharon Snyder said Tuesday that she could not
confirm or deny the status of FDA action due to trade regulations.
She noted, however, that average elapsed time for FDA approval of
diagnostic devices in 1999 was just over 12 months. Given Imaging
applied for FDA approval in May.
</P>
<P>
   Company researchers claim the pill, 1 inch in length and
one-third of an inch in diameter, offers a better and less painful
alternative to conventional endoscopy, in which a probe is inserted
orally or rectally.
</P>
<P>
   ''The patient swallows it, and can go out, doing their own
business,'' said Eitan Scapa, a gastroenterology specialist at Tel
Aviv's Assaf Harofe hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers have expressed skepticism that the images
would match fiber-optic endoscopes for detail, and raised concerns
that the camera's view might be obscured by bubbly saliva or green
bile.
</P>
<P>
   The capsule cannot be stopped or steered to collect close-up
details of the small intestine's millions of interior wrinkles
where ailments often occur. Nor is it fitted with surgical tools
like a conventional endoscope to take biopsies or treat bleeding
lesions or remove polyps.
</P>
<P>
   The pill, excreted after about four hours, was designed to
examine the small intestine especially, Scapa said. Current probing
methods can only reach the upper third of the intestine.
</P>
<P>
   An independent gastroenterologist, however, said the capsule
posed medical risks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a revolution, no question about it,'' said Simon
Bar-Meir, director of the gastrointestinal department of the Chaim
Sheba Medical Center in Tel Hashomer. ''But the main problem is
that if there is a partial obstruction in the small intestine there
is a risk that the pill will get stuck there.''
</P>
<P>
   He said such a situation could become life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ''A patient who might have come in for diagnostical reasons may
end up in the emergency room for intestinal obstruction,'' Bar-Meir
said.
</P>
<P>
   Given Imaging officials said such complications were unlikely --
but acknowledged that for now, it would prohibit use to those who
have had major abdominal operations or a history of abdominal
obstruction, pregnant women, those with pacemakers, and diabetes
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials say the pill itself will cost about $300 for
patients and the entire system will cost $30,000 for hospitals,
including the receptors and computer station.

<HEADLINE> Japan Island Readies For Evacuation  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GUTTENFELDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIYAKE ISLAND, Japan (AP) -- An earthquake and small eruption
rocked a volcanic island south of Tokyo early Wednesday, and naval
forces stationed a destroyer off the coast in preparation for a
quick evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   The seismic rumbling followed two larger eruptions of the
2,686-foot Mount Oyama on Tuesday that blanketed the island with
ash and cinder and forced the evacuation of 235 children and school
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Tokyo city government on Wednesday announced it was
preparing to accept the island's remaining 2,000 inhabitants and
shelter them on vacant city housing and evacuation centers. Tokyo
oversees the island.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are almost ready to evacuate all of them in a very short
time, if and when a large scale eruption occurs,'' said Koichi
Harukawa, a city official handling the evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   A destroyer and two minesweepers requested by Tokyo reached the
island Wednesday. The destroyer can carry 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's rumblings were the latest since the volcano came
back to life early last month after a 17-year silence and forced
the evacuation of about half the island's 4,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   Oyama spewed a 1.6-mile-high column of smoke and ash at 4:24
a.m. Wednesday. That was followed by a magnitude-4.8 quake at 10:37
a.m. centered near the island at a depth of six miles.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of damage or injuries, and the
Meteorological Agency said there was no danger of tsunami tidal
waves from the quake.
</P>
<P>
   On the island, residents -- wearing towels over their faces --
were busy sweeping up the 6 inches of ash from their cars and
yards, many climbing onto their roofs to shovel off the debris and
carting it away in wheelbarrows.
</P>
<P>
   Sulfur dioxide from recent eruptions has been blown toward
Tokyo, where levels of the noxious gas have risen to about 10 times
normal, but not yet serious enough to warrant a health warning.
</P>
<P>
   Experts have said that shifts in huge underground pools of magma
are responsible for the recent volcanic and seismic activity on
Miyake, about 118 miles south of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-square-mile island, part of the Izu chain, has now
erupted eight times since July 8. It and neighboring islands have
also been shaken by thousands of earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Oyama's last big eruption was in 1983. Five hundred homes
were destroyed when lava flowed over its western flank, though
timely evacuations prevented any casualties.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Disbarment Is Too Harsh  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES JEFFERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The testimony at the center of
President Clinton's disbarment lawsuit was so minor that stripping
him of his law license would be too severe a penalty, his lawyers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Their comments came Tuesday in a five-page response to a state
disciplinary panel's complaint that the president gave misleading
testimony during the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and is no
longer fit to be a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the basis of the relevant facts, the governing law and the
applicable decisions of the Arkansas courts ... a sanction of
disbarment would be excessively harsh, impermissibly punitive and
unprecedented in the circumstances of this case,'' Clinton's
lawyers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Jones filed suit in May 1994, alleging Clinton made a crude
sexual advance toward her three years earlier in a Little Rock
hotel room. Jones' lawyers had hoped to use evidence of Clinton's
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky as part
of an attempt to show a pattern of predatory behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed June 30, the Arkansas Supreme Court Committee
on Professional Conduct accused the president of lying under oath
in 1998 about his relationship with Lewinsky to spare himself
embarrassment. In the response filed Tuesday, Clinton's lawyers
acknowledged that the president was attempting to save face.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ''took actions motivated in part by a desire to protect
himself and others from embarrassment,'' the lawyers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Pulaski County Circuit Judge Leon Johnson said he expected to
receive Clinton's filing Tuesday but otherwise would not discuss
the case, including when it might be scheduled for a hearing or
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Marie-Bernarde Miller, the prosecutor, would not comment on
Clinton's filing. She had asked that the matter be cleared up
before the end of the year when Johnson leaves office, but would
not say if the filing would help her meet that timetable.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Glavin, president of the Southeastern Legal Foundation of
Atlanta, which had asked for Clinton's disbarment, said the
proposed sanctions were not too harsh.
</P>
<P>
   ''Honesty and candor are absolute prerequisites in our bar,''
Glavin said. ''The Supreme Court has made it clear what's required
for membership in the Arkansas bar. Mr. Clinton doesn't meet those
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was found in contempt and fined more than $90,000 last
year by U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright, who said he
intentionally gave misleading testimony about Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, however, said the Lewinsky material was not essential to
Jones' case, and later dismissed Jones' lawsuit.

<HEADLINE> Head of CNN Domestic Said Leaving  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The head of CNN's national operations, Rick
Kaplan, is departing as the cable news network struggles to turn
around sagging ratings.
</P>
<P>
   A CNN staff meeting in Atlanta was scheduled for Wednesday to
discuss the changes, said a network executive speaking on condition
of anonymity. The executive confirmed Kaplan's departure.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan did not return a phone call placed to his office late
Tuesday. Network spokesmen would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan, who won 34 Emmy Awards as a longtime producer at ABC,
joined CNN as president of its USA operations in August 1997, given
the mission to bolster the network's viewership during times it
didn't have breaking news to depend upon.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, CNN has frequently found itself eclipsed by CNBC as the
appetite for financial news increased and beset by increased
competition from Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   The network proclaimed itself ''America's Campaign
Headquarters'' and placed a strong emphasis on political coverage
this year. But its ratings for the GOP convention, for example,
were 27 percent below convention coverage four years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan survived a major scandal less than a year into his
tenure, when the network had to retract a story that claimed the
U.S. military used nerve gas on defectors during the Vietnam War.
Two producers were fired as a result of the May 1998 report and
correspondent Peter Arnett left CNN within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan also feuded with longtime CNN financial anchor Lou Dobbs,
who left CNN for an Internet venture.
</P>
<P>
   The network, founded by Ted Turner, celebrated its 20th
anniversary this spring.

<HEADLINE> Documentary Captures Gingrich Fall  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY McMURRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Filmmaker Michael Pack says it was pure luck
that in his project to chronicle six ordinary months in the life of
then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich, he turned up six extraordinary
ones.
</P>
<P>
   When Pack's cameras started following the Georgia Republican in
September 1998 during a dinosaur bone search in Montana, the intent
was to contrast this moment of relaxation with an otherwise hectic
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Little did he know how vivid the contrast would turn out to be.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the House would ponder whether to impeach President
Clinton, and Gingrich's grasp on one of the country's most powerful
posts would unravel in lightning speed. Pack's 90-minute retelling,
''The Fall of Newt Gingrich,'' airs at 8 p.m. EDT Wednesday on PBS
stations.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to tell who got the better end of a pre-taping
arrangement: Pack's behind-the-scenes access to fascinating
political theater, or Gingrich's assurance the footage wouldn't be
made public until well after the fact.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once people grant you access, sometimes they forget about the
cameras,'' said the Manifold Productions president, whose credits
include a documentary last year on the Rodney King incident and
another on the Gingrich-led Republican takeover of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ''We weren't news cameras. They knew there would be at least a
six-month lag; that they weren't in some gotcha journalism trap.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, perhaps the documentary's most stunning revelation was
the presence of cameras themselves during sensitive closed-door
leadership meetings, when Gingrich and his allies hash out how to
punish a president for lying about a sex act under oath.
</P>
<P>
   In one such meeting, Rep. David Hobson makes the case that many
people want to dispose of the matter quickly so they can ''get on
with their lives,'' but fellow Ohio Republican John Boehner insists
he hears the opposite sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich appears almost bored during these proceedings and any
time a member of the press or congressional candidate brings up
impeachment. He tries to step out of the spotlight and allow
Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde to lead the charge, but the question
continues to haunt him.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Pack the following March -- after Clinton's
impeachment and Gingrich's resignation under fire -- the former
House speaker seems to criticize independent counsel Kenneth
Starr's graphic report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way Starr wrote the report was much too sex-oriented, and
not legally oriented enough,'' Gingrich said. ''On the other hand,
do you believe the American people ought to have the right to have
information about their government?''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich even concedes conviction in the Senate probably
wouldn't have been the correct response to the allegations. Such
doubts could have been a prime weapon for Clinton defenders had
they known about them at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Pack also interviews Gingrich's former wife, Marianne, who
discusses Gingrich's ability to fall asleep on a campaign bus and
wake up exactly 15 minutes later without an alarm clock.
</P>
<P>
   The film only gives passing reference to their divorce and
Gingrich's recent marriage to a longtime congressional aide. Pack
says his purpose was to show the speaker as a political figure, not
provide exhausting details about his personal life or personality.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras also chronicle the Nov. 3 election night, when
Republicans lose five House seats despite Gingrich's earlier
predictions they would gain more than 20.
</P>
<P>
   Even that night, Gingrich's senior political director, Joe
Gaylord, expresses confidence -- which ultimately will be exposed as
overconfidence -- that ''we would gain seats, it was only a matter
of how many we gain.''
</P>
<P>
   As the night progresses, smiles disappear from Gingrich's ''war
room,'' and multiple shots capture the speaker, mouth widened in
disbelief. Later, he tells Pack he was ''genuinely confused.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich goes on camera to accept his share of the blame, but
even in the walk to the interview room, he tries to cast the losses
in the best possible light, explaining to his advisers that most
GOP incumbents were victorious.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, a somber-looking Sen. Paul Coverdell is seen
slumping in a chair and talking on the phone beneath a sign that
reads: ''Speaker Newt Gingrich's Victory.'' Coverdell, who helped
Gingrich map out a strategy in the 1970s to get Republicans elected
in Georgia, died last month from a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   The film doesn't conclude why Republicans lost so badly, and
Pack says he doesn't even know for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it simply breezes through the well-documented
resignations of Gingrich and heir-apparent Bob Livingston, who
steps down on the day Clinton is impeached after admitting his own
extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   As a lame duck, Gingrich had tried to keep a low-key profile
during impeachment. But he tells Pack that as soon as the Louisiana
congressman resigned, he called Illinois Republican Dennis Hastert
to ''draft'' him as the next speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the film, Pack reveals the fierce rivalry between
Gingrich and Clinton, whom, the speaker says, he found ''routinely
unreliable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He won the personality contest, and I won the policies,''
Gingrich said. ''It's a swap I would have taken.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Fighting Drugs in Colombia  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton headed to Colombia Wednesday
with $1.3 billion in U.S. aid earmarked for propping up the South
American nation's fight against drugs and insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   His brief visit was confined to the scenic Caribbean port city
of Cartagena, site of a major hemispheric drug summit 10 years ago
and far from the violence and poppy and coca fields that yield much
of the cocaine and heroin used in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's trip was aimed at boosting Colombian President Andres
Pastrana's $7.5 billion initiative to ease the narco-traffickers'
grip on his nation, make peace with insurgents financed by drug
profits, rev up the economy and strengthen the justice system.
</P>
<P>
   ''Colombia's democracy is under attack,'' Clinton said in an
address televised to Colombians on the eve of his visit. ''Profits
from the drug trade fund civil conflict. Powerful forces make their
own law, and you face danger every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was spending all his time in Cartagena, a 467-year-old
coastal city with churches, monasteries and shaded plazas. Situated
on the northern tip of Colombia, Cartagena is 400 miles from the
nation's capital, Bogota, and farther still from the southern
sections of the country where guerillas and paramilitary groups
rule.
</P>
<P>
   His stay is short partly because of security concerns in a
nation the State Department calls one of the most violent in the
world. Ninety percent of the cocaine in the U.S. market and
two-thirds of the heroin on the East Coast comes from Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit includes a tour of the Port of Cartagena where
he will be briefed on drug-interdiction efforts, meet with
Colombian National Police and talk with widows of police officers
who have been killed in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he will go to a low-income neighborhood to tour a Casa de
Justicia, one of 20 centers funded by the U.S. Agency for
International Development that gives Colombia's poor greater access
to the justice system. People can walk into these centers and see
ombudsmen, social workers, public defenders, mediators and others
who can help them resolve civil and criminal matters.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to bolster law and order in a country overrun by
lawlessness.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana himself was kidnapped by the Medellin drug cartel in
the late 1980s and freed in a dramatic rescue. But besides fighting
drug traffickers, the one-time mayor of Bogota and former fellow at
Harvard University is trying to nudge the nation out of recession.
</P>
<P>
   Economic growth declined 3.5 percent in 1999, although it was up
by 2.2 percent in the first quarter of this year. Unemployment
reached 20 percent in mid-1999, but is on the decline.
</P>
<P>
   Elected on a peace platform, Pastrana also is trying to
negotiate an end to hostilities with Marxist guerillas and
right-wing paramilitary groups. In conflict with the state for 36
years, both engage in kidnapping and other acts of violence against
citizens, foreigners, the government and commercial installations,
such as oil pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very tough place,'' said Sandy Berger, Clinton's
national security adviser. ''I think we can either ... help
Colombia in its effort to deal with that problem, or stand back and
let Colombian democracy collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. part of Pastrana's ''Plan Colombia'' is aimed at
helping the Colombian military take control of cocaine-producing
regions held by the guerrillas and paramilitary groups. The U.S.
assistance includes funds for 60 combat helicopters and training
for the Colombian military, plus money for building schoolrooms,
water systems and roads, judicial reform and protecting human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Clinton waived conditions for the release of the U.S.
aid that are aimed at overcoming military abuses and bringing human
rights violators to justice. The decision prompted protests from
human rights groups and some lawmakers, including Sen. Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt. ''There will be tough questions when they come back to
Congress this fall for the next installment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is providing the Black Hawk and Huey
helicopters and training to support a military push into Southern
jungles where guerillas and the militias take payoffs to protect
peasant drug plots and traffickers' airstrips and labs.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials insist that Washington is not being embroiled in
a Vietnam-style civil conflict. They say, however, that
U.S.-trained troops and equipment will be used against guerrillas
who try to block efforts to eradicate drug crops and destroy labs.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rios, a commander of the most powerful guerrilla group
known as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, has vowed to
resist what he calls ''U.S. aggression.''

<HEADLINE> Indonesia May Aid in Clinton Probe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia's attorney general has asked
police here to help U.S. investigators probe a local businessman's
contributions to President Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The businessman, James Riady, is one of the central figures in
the campaign fund-raising scandals of 1992 and 1996. Clinton has
said he does not remember a 1992 limousine ride in which Riady
purportedly pledged to funnel $1 million in donations to his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have asked the police to investigate,'' Attorney General
Marzuki Darusman said in reply to a question about the possible
involvement of Riady, the billionaire owner of Lippo Group, in
Clinton campaign fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Darusman said that during a March visit, a senior U.S. Justice
Department official requested Indonesia's assistance in
establishing whether Riady had worked to illegally funnel
contributions to Clinton's White House campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have written to police, suggesting to them to cooperate
with FBI in its investigation of the case,'' Darusman said.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI summary released last year said Democratic fund-raiser
John Huang, a Riady employee, alleged that Riady had told the
then-Arkansas governor during a limousine ride that he wanted to
raise $1 million for his campaign. In the following weeks, Riady
employees donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the
Democratic Party, the summary said.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, Clinton told federal investigators that he did not
have ''a specific recollection of what the conversation was, or
this fact of the car ride.'' He said he only remembered seeing
Riady ''sometime in '92 after I became the nominee,'' and that
Riady pledged to help his campaign.

<HEADLINE> Hispanic, Asian Population Booming  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN BACHMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DORAVILLE, Ga. (AP) -- Jose Quintana is among an increasing
number of Hispanics drawn to this Atlanta suburb, welcomed by a
tight community of helpful immigrants who came before.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, 17 people can come here together, live together,
look out for each other. We help each other,'' said Quintana, a
Salvadoran who moved to Georgia six months ago from Rochester,
N.Y., to live with his sister. ''No English? They'll help you. It's
a community.''
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau estimates released Wednesday show that increases
in the nation's two fastest-growing minority populations --
Hispanics and Asians -- are beginning to spur growth in
nontraditional immigrant destinations such as northern Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   And in California, the state's minority population became a
majority during the 1990s, marking the first time since 1860 that
whites did not constitute a majority. Non-Hispanic whites were 57
percent of California's population a decade ago, according to the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Between July 1, 1990, and July 1, 1999, the nation's Asian and
Pacific Islander population grew 43 percent to 10.8 million, and
the Hispanic population grew 38.8 percent to 31.3 million, the
Census estimates show. These are the last such estimates to be
released before detailed Census 2000 results come out next year.
</P>
<P>
   While California, Texas and New York -- the three most populous
states -- still have the highest numbers of minorities, Nevada,
Georgia and North Carolina experienced the biggest percent
increases, Census analyst Larry Sink said.
</P>
<P>
   In northern Georgia, a construction boom along with abundant
jobs at poultry processing and carpet-making plants have caused
Hispanic immigration to surge.
</P>
<P>
   Doraville sits on the edge of Gwinnett County, which saw its
Hispanic population surge 215.6 percent in the 90s to 26,731.
Another metro Atlanta county, Cobb, had a 158.9 percent jump to
24,350. Similar increases were seen among Asians, up 180.7 percent
to 28,793 in Gwinnett and up 135.7 percent to 18,758 in Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the white population increased 7.3 percent between
1990 and 1999 to 224.6 million. Blacks remained the largest
minority group, experiencing a 13.8 percent spike during the same
period to 34.8 million, while the American Indian and Alaska Native
population increased 15.5 percent to 2.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada's 50 percent population growth led all states during the
'90s. Its Asian population rose 123.7 percent to 88,208, the
largest such increase in the nation, while its Hispanic population
rose 144.6 percent to 304,364. Hispanics can be of any race.
</P>
<P>
   California had the biggest Hispanic population, with 10.4
million. Arkansas, meanwhile, had the largest percentage growth
among Hispanics, increasing 170.3 percent to 53,729 in the 90s.
</P>
<P>
   New jobs in construction, food processing and textile industries
make Georgia attractive to immigrants, said Robert Giacomini,
director of research for the state's data center.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews Tuesday, many Atlanta-area immigrants said an
abundance of jobs with decent wages had lured them to one of the
country's fastest-growing cities. Some, including Fernando Lopez,
said they moved from Texas after hearing friends say that
construction work paid better in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the money,'' said Lopez, rubbing his fingers together to
signify cash, who moved to suburban Atlanta last year from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The population changes can be seen in small ways: It's possible,
for example, to buy a daily Chinese newspaper at the Buford Highway
Farmers Market, a Korean-owned grocery with a majority Hispanic
clientele.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Yan, a manager of the Farmers Market, said Koreans flock
to Gwinnett County for the same reason so many others have moved to
Atlanta in recent years -- ''a lot of trees, fresh air and the
schools are OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Graciela Lopez Blancarte moved to Norcross, a neighboring
Gwinnett County suburb, from Mexico two years ago looking for work.
She doesn't speak English, but cleans houses and has found no
shortage of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good place to live,'' she said.

   Then there's the romantic black comedy ''Whipped,'' opening
Friday. Peet stars as the deceptively sweet Mia, who gets her kicks
by viciously turning the tables on three best friends who spend
their time scamming women into sex and then boasting of their
exploits.
</P>
<P>
   ''I loved that, that eventually these womanizing pigs got what
was coming to them,'' Peet said.
</P>
<P>
   Tough talk. But it is a fictional comeuppance Peet refers to.
Good thing for Brian Van Holt, who plays one of those womanizing
pigs. Van Holt is Peet's real-life boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Peet does talk tough and bluntly, whether about men and women,
sexual squeamishness by the movie industry's film raters, or the
frustrations early in her career, when she acted in a string of
independent features that never made it to theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those movies are nowhere. You can't find them,'' Peet said in
an interview while sitting on an inflatable sofa at a funky West
Hollywood hotel. ''I really thought I was cursed.''
</P>
<P>
   Peet's sense of bad self-karma became so acute, she warned
''Whipped'' writer-director Peter Cohen about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was like, 'Peter, you should not put me in this movie
because it's never going to go anywhere if you do,''' Peet said.
''He always laughed about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, though, Peet might have felt her indie curse was
continuing. Independently financed, ''Whipped'' was shot over a few
weeks in early 1998. Then Cohen was unable to land the sharp satire
at a major film festival, where he had hoped it would catch
distributors' attention.
</P>
<P>
   He used his own money to pay for a finished print to show
distributors, and Destination Films finally acquired the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen laments that had it sold earlier, ''Whipped'' could have
been at the vanguard of a new wave of hip sex comedies, including
''There's Something About Mary,'' ''American Pie'' and the HBO
series ''Sex and the City.''
</P>
<P>
   But the delay could prove beneficial. Peet's profile has risen
dramatically in the last year or so through roles in ''The Whole
Nine Yards'' and ''Simply Irresistible,'' plus her WB network
series ''Jack &AMP; Jill.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Whipped'' now has the appearance of a well-timed coming-out
party for a supporting player stepping into the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''You try not to think of things that way,'' Peet said when
asked if ''Whipped'' could be her breakout role. ''You just kind of
do your press interviews and pray for good grosses for the sake of
everybody. I'm proud of this movie, though. I'm proud of it for
personal reasons. It was such a small movie, it's like a Cinderella
story.''
</P>
<P>
   New Yorker Peet, 28, had a Cinderella-like start after deciding
to pursue an acting career in college at Columbia University. She
landed parts early on in Edward Burns' ''She's the One'' and the
Michelle Pfeiffer-George Clooney romance ''One Fine Day.'' Then
came those movies that went nowhere, such films as ''Origin of the
Species,'' ''1999'' and ''Touch Me.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I wasn't ready, but I just wanted to work. I had the
philosophy that work begets work,'' Peet said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only way you get better is by working. You cannot do it in
a class, and you cannot do it in the mirror at home, and you cannot
do it by fantasizing. You can watch all the Meryl Streep movies in
the world and all the Katharine Hepburn movies in the world, but
you can't learn to do it until you're up there doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Simply by making it to theaters, ''Whipped'' has broken Peet's
unlucky streak. Her ''Whipped'' colleagues credit that largely to
Peet's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm really proud of her because she cares so much,'' said Van
Holt, who plays a Wall Street sleaze in ''Whipped'' and began
dating Peet six months after the movie was shot. ''She's very
disciplined and works very hard. Of course, she has that natural
talent and beauty, which helps.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend had recommended Peet to Cohen, who was looking for an
actress who could make Mia strong and pitiless yet endearing at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I needed the audience to fall in love with her as well as our
characters,'' Cohen said. ''And I needed someone who was more
unique than the typical Hollywood blond bombshell. It was a strong
female lead and portrayed women where they really kind of win, in
the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said Peet was instrumental in crafting the movie's ending,
in which Mia and her friends talk brazenly about men, echoing the
male characters' bull sessions earlier. Peet and a friend rewrote
the dialogue to better reflect a female perspective about scamming
men, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   The dialogue hit too hard with movie raters for the Motion
Picture Association of America, which initially gave ''Whipped'' an
NC-17 rating, which would have barred anyone younger than 17. Cohen
said he repeatedly toned down the dialogue, mostly among the women,
finally gaining an R rating.
</P>
<P>
   ''They just were not pleased seeing women talking the way we
did,'' Peet said. ''I think it's totally sexist in that they don't
want to see women talking about sex in a glib way, because women
aren't supposed to be aggressors or really sexualized people.
</P>
<P>
   ''Interestingly, what they were responding to was dialogue.
Everything they responded to was verbal. It's OK for somebody to
shoot somebody. It's OK to show rape and non-loving sex. But it's
not OK to have a satire where a movie makes fun of men trying to be
cruel and fearless and unfazed by sex.''

<HEADLINE> Tarsha Vega Aims for Stardom  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Politely but firmly, Tarsha Vega corrects anyone
who wonders how her life will change if she becomes a big music
star.
</P>
<P>
   ''When,'' she says, interrupting a question. ''I deal not in
ifs.''
</P>
<P>
   Excuse us. Maybe that attitude is the necessary brash exterior
for someone bred in the Bronx, or simply the self-confidence of a
singer who watched record companies scramble after her in a bidding
war before her first disc was made.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Vega doesn't bother to doubt where she's headed.
Judging by her debut, due out in October, she has the goods to back
it up. Her infectious modern pop is calculated for mass appeal, and
RCA, the record company that launched Christina Aguilera's career,
is giving her a big push.
</P>
<P>
   ''It all happened very fast,'' said Vega, who declines to give
her age. ''It wasn't something I had to struggle for, or knock down
doors. I purposely put it in my brain to be instant, and it
happened that way. If I think about something and I believe in it,
it happens instantly.''
</P>
<P>
   The song, ''Be Ya Self,'' is on the radio now and illustrates
the strategy for world domination. A rapping message of
self-determination to girls, it's built around the hook and key
lyric of Rick Nelson's ''Garden Party'': ''If you can't please
everyone, you've got to please yourself.'' Vega's version urges
listeners to ''be yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The song is designed so no one -- mom, dad or daughter -- will be
tempted to change the station when it comes on the car radio.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was important to me,'' she said. ''Why not get parents
and kids to relate to the song? Why not get the black kids and the
white kids to relate to it?''
</P>
<P>
   One claim about her upbringing in the Bronx already sounds like
future legend: When Vega and her mother moved out of her
grandmother's home for a place of their own, they had enough money
for a bed or a stereo system, not both. She said she chose the
music and slept on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother tried to make Vega culturally rounded, taking her to
museums as she grew up. She took drama and dance courses in school,
and was drawn to Manhattan for a variety of experiences: singing
and acting in commercials, working at ''CBS Evening News'' and
modeling.
</P>
<P>
   With some friends who appeared in the off-Broadway musical
''Stomp,'' Vega went out one night and met the duo of Dave Schommer
and Sam Hollander. Known as Pop Rox, they are music producers who
worked on such cuts as Sisqo's ''Thong Song'' and DMX's ''Party Up
in Here.''
</P>
<P>
   She visited them in the studio, and they did a double take when
they heard her voice.
</P>
<P>
   They worked together on a demo tape that quickly caught the
interest of record companies eager to sign anyone who could appeal
to the powerful new youth demographic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I describe my music as intelligent pop, hip-hop and soul,''
she said. ''I made it to be really consciously world music, as
opposed to one specific genre. I'm always thinking on a real
positive level, but not fluffy. I didn't want it to be all pink and
yellow.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides being smart and sassy, her album is a name-checker's
delight. Vega references some expected figures, like Bob Marley,
Sisqo and Big Pun. But others she mentions may send her audience to
books, or at least to their parents: Shirley Chisholm, Frank Zappa,
Ben Folds, Katharine Hepburn and David E. Kelley.
</P>
<P>
   She even salutes Seymour Stein, a record company executive who
courted her but lost out to RCA.
</P>
<P>
   ''He discovered Madonna,'' she said. ''He was so cool in his
vibe and was great. He was one of the first people to give me love.
Just because we didn't go with him doesn't mean I don't respect
him.''
</P>
<P>
   At her song publisher's suggestion, she met with RCA last
Thanksgiving. Vega's tape immediately struck RCA executives as
''very current and fresh and very catchy,'' said Jack Rovner, the
company's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think she's got the ingredients to have that success,'' he
said. ''She has a very positive approach. She's very endearing --
anybody she has touched so far comes back with a strong feeling
about her.''
</P>
<P>
   One of RCA's first steps was to try to place one of Vega's songs
in a big-budget movie this summer. The good news is they succeeded.
The bad news is the movie was ''The Adventures of Rocky and
Bullwinkle,'' one of the year's biggest flops.
</P>
<P>
   Vega duets on her album with Carole King, a legendary music
figure whose music Vega was familiar with through years of
listening to soft rock radio stations. It was a suggestion that,
oddly, came when one of the producers' wives had a dream about Vega
singing with King.
</P>
<P>
   King was contacted and -- Vega imitates her raspy voice -- said,
''Let me hear the child's music.'' She was impressed enough to fly
east to sing on ''Rooftops,'' and gave Vega an autographed picture
with the inscription, ''U-D-B.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That stands for 'u da bomb,''' Vega translates.
</P>
<P>
   Her song ''Time'' is dedicated to the class of 2001. It is a
blistering indictment of schools with teachers who ''leave ya up
the creek like Dawson.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I love education and think education is extremely important,''
she said. ''But as far as the public school system is concerned, it
needs a lot of work. If anybody can take their kid out of public
schools, do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in school, Vega obviously had her mind on other things. She
is so sure of her destiny that she kept her circle of friends small
and has always avoided having her picture taken with big groups so
there are fewer folks who will one day have evidence that they
''knew her then.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew all my life that I would be an entertainer,'' she said.
''I just didn't know where. So I've always been preparing for it.''

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Works Literary Magic  </HEADLINE>
By PETER MUELLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's best-known wizard sits at
his computer, idly pulling on a cigarette and checking his e-mail.
He doesn't part the clouds these days or slip unperceived through a
crowd, though he hasn't forgotten how.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always was and always will be a wizard,'' Paulo Coelho says.
''But those tricks are pretty useless.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Coelho weaves a more practical sort of magic by
enchanting readers with tales of his quest for spiritual
enlightenment and turning homespun parables into worldwide best
sellers.
</P>
<P>
   With some 28 million books sold in 45 languages and more than
120 countries, Coelho is by far Brazil's most widely read author.
Awards have poured in -- France recently made him a Knight of the
Legion of Honor -- and his fans include Julia Roberts, Madonna and
even President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said Chelsea gave him a book of mine to read, and he loved
it,'' Coelho says with a laugh. ''I asked if I could quote him on
that, and he said, 'Sure.'''
</P>
<P>
   His appeal seems boundless. On a recent visit to Iran, 1,500
fans were on hand to meet his plane -- at 2 a.m. A book signing drew
5,000 people, then was canceled when security agents said they
couldn't control the raucous crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was extraordinary, beyond all my expectations,'' Coelho
says, shaking his head. ''You know where I sell the most books?
Iran and Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   He stares bemusedly out the picture window of the airy,
high-ceilinged apartment on Avenida Atlantica, as if beguiled by
his own success. The long curve of Copacabana Beach stretches away
toward Sugarloaf in the golden afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what the secret is,'' he says finally. ''Maybe
there's no secret. Or maybe it's that I just offer the question,
not the answer, like a direction to find your own way home.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before my first book, I thought the spiritual search was
complicated. I thought it was for an elite. But it's just a
question of looking around and perceiving.''
</P>
<P>
   In faded jeans, gray hair retreating into a tiny pony tail and a
butterfly tattoo on his arm, the 53-year-old Coelho looks like an
aging hippie -- which he is. His first fling with fame came in the
1970s, as a lyricist for legendary Brazilian rocker Raul Seixas.
</P>
<P>
   With Seixas, he also had a brush with black magic -- a little too
close. In his book ''The Valkyries,'' Coelho describes his terror
at the mad, bodiless laughter that pursued him and the swirling
black whirlpools that appeared to him in the kitchen floor. He
renounced black magic, lost his job and friends -- and changed his
life.
</P>
<P>
   It was during a visit to the Dachau concentration camp in
Munich, Germany, that he says a spirit appeared and encouraged him
to become a wizard.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Coelho made the ancient, mystical pilgrimage along the
500-mile Road of Santiago across the north of Spain. Walking six
hours a day for 70 days along the ''sacred path'' from the Pyrenees
Mountains to the city of Santiago de Compostela, he discovered an
honorary society of wizards, founded in the tiny northern Spain
village in 1492 by a group of magicians. Coelho drew on his travels
to write ''The Pilgrimage'' and ''The Alchemist.''
</P>
<P>
   Success was almost immediate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Alchemist,'' the tale of a shepherd boy's quest for
spiritual fulfillment -- his ''personal legend,'' as Coelho says --
became a No. 1 best seller in 29 countries. His Web page claims it
is recommended reading at schools in France, Italy, Spain,
Portugal, Taiwan, Brazil and the United States, including the
University of Chicago's graduate school of business.
</P>
<P>
   His newest book is ''Veronika Decides to Die,'' published by
HarperCollins. It is a tale of spiritual growth in a mental
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho again draws on his own experience as a teen-ager, when
his parents -- worried about his rebelliousness and his involvement
with leftist opposition to Brazil's military regime -- placed him in
an institution.
</P>
<P>
   Veronika leads a comfortable life in Slovenia but wearies of the
routine and tries to kill herself with pills. She awakes in a
mental hospital, where she is told she has a week to live. The
hospital and the imminence of death free Veronika from conventions,
and she discovers hate, love, sex and life with fellow inmate
Eduardo -- Coelho's thinly disguised persona.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your destiny is your personal legend -- it is written. But
often we must live the destiny that others impose, like fathers on
their sons,'' Coelho says.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was in the hospital, I asked why God wanted me to go
through all these things. When I learned other people had panic
attacks, it helped me to heal. When you know you're not alone, it
creates a complicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, he sees a positive side to his ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it was the first time that I had to confront the
realities of life. There are certain experiences that will either
kill you or make you stronger. That was an experience that made me
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   While readers love the simple tales and upbeat messages, critics
often are less than kind.
</P>
<P>
   ''Critics don't ignore me -- either they are very positive or
very violent,'' Coelho says. ''If the critics weren't so rough I
wouldn't sell so many books. It makes me take a position, and the
reader, too. It means I'm touching a nerve. I'm the vanguard.''
</P>
<P>
   Coelho's literary idols are Argentina's Jorge Luis Borges and
Henry Miller, especially for his ''Tropic of Cancer.'' He calls
James Joyce's ''Ulysses'' the ''great lie of the century,''
inspiring generations of imitators to write obscure and difficult
books nobody reads.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays Coelho turns out a book about every two years. He works
intensely, writing 15 hours a day and having a first draft ready in
two to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always write at night when I'm very tired,'' he says. ''Then
there are no blocks, no self-censorship. It's more natural.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many Brazilians, his spirituality is nonexclusive. On his
wrist is a red ribbon, typical of Brazil's African-based spirit
religions, but he remains a devout Catholic and attends mass.
There's a painting of Jesus over the bed and statues of Catholic
saints on the night table, and the Bible next to the computer is
open to the New Testament.
</P>
<P>
   Fame has brought a constant demand for lectures and public
appearances, but Coelho finds time to take part in UNESCO's
interreligious committee. Royalties from his books fund the Paulo
Coelho Institute, a nonprofit group that supports underprivileged
elderly Brazilians and helps sponsor the Children of Light Day Care
Center in Rio's Pavao-Pavaozinho shantytown.
</P>
<P>
   On a rare day such as this, he can relax at the apartment he
shares with his wife, artist Cristina Oiticica, or stroll along the
beach, graciously accepting a stream of compliments,
congratulations and occasional requests for money.
</P>
<P>
   He is wary of the pitfalls of success.
</P>
<P>
   ''Defeat and victory can paralyze you,'' Coelho says. He plans
to keep moving forward -- and admits it's been a good life so far.
</P>
<P>
   ''I married the woman I love, wrote the books I wanted, lived
intensely, asked forgiveness of the people I had to -- I did
everything,'' he says. ''I lived a life few people ever do.''

<HEADLINE> Fall Brings Crop of Beatle Books  </HEADLINE>
By HILLEL ITALIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Thirty years after their breakup, and 20 years
after the death of John Lennon, it's time yet again to meet the
Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   In bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   At least nine Beatle-related titles are expected this fall, from
the authorized ''The Beatles Anthology'' to a biography of their
late manager, Brian Epstein. Other books include an illustrated
volume of Paul McCartney's paintings, a reissue of Lennon's
collection of verse, ''In His Own Write,'' and a look at the
Beatles' time in India with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.
</P>
<P>
   While a generation has been born and raised since the Beatles
were together, they remain a major moneymaker and cultural
presence. The band's albums sold more than 50 million copies
worldwide over the past decade. Dozens of Beatles fans clubs still
exist, from Australia to Russia to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Beatle books have been coming out since the group first started,
but readers apparently still want more. ''The Beatles Anthology,''
an oral history assembled by the three surviving Beatles and
Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, has advance orders of more than 1 million
and will be published in at least eight languages.
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember being at the booksellers convention a couple of
years ago and Linda McCartney was there to promote one of her
vegetarian cookbooks,'' says Constance Sayre, director of Marketing
Partners International, a publishing consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ''The publisher gave a party and you should have seen the lineup
of people to shake Sir Paul's hand. You've never seen such a crowd.
The Beatles are certainly a big deal with booksellers.''
</P>
<P>
   A minor surprise is the reissue of ''Lennon Remembers,''
Lennon's famously bitter, marathon interview with Rolling Stone
publisher Jann Wenner, given just as the group was breaking up.
Lennon had agreed to the interview on the condition that Wenner not
put it out in book form. When he did so anyway, Lennon was enraged
and spoke bitterly about Wenner right until the end of his life.
</P>
<P>
   But the new publication arrives with the approval of Yoko Ono,
who contributed a forward. Material originally edited out has been
restored and some lyrics never recorded will be included.
</P>
<P>
   '''Lennon Remembers' is classic Lennon,'' Ono writes. ''It's not
a sit-back-and-put-your-feet-up read. ... It's a jolt on your
nerves like bad, bad espresso. People with weak stomachs should
close the window before reading. You might just feel like jumping
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Beatles, this fall marks another ongoing publishing
obsession, the Clintons. The titles can almost be divided into
subgenres: attack books, memoirs and policy papers.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the attack genre are ''I Feel Your Pain: The Explosion
and Abuse of Power During the Clinton-Gore Years'' and ''Sell Out:
The Inside Story of Bill Clinton's Impeachment.'' Memoirs include
''Eyewitness to Power,'' by former adviser David Gergen, and
''POTUS Speaks,'' by speechwriter Michael Waldman. (POTUS is
Washingtonian for President of the United States.)
</P>
<P>
   Among those sticking to policy are former labor secretary Robert
B. Reich, who critiques e-commerce in ''The Future of Success,''
and former national security adviser Anthony Lake, who reviews
foreign policy in ''Six Nightmares.'' Bob Woodward reviews the
economy in ''Maestro: Inside Greenspan's Fed and the American
Boom.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Clinton aide Paul Begala looks to this year's
presidential campaign with ''Is Our Children Learning?'' an actual
quote from Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Al Gore, meanwhile, gets
the treatment in ''Al Gore: A User's Manual,'' by Alexander
Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair. The true specialist might look for
reissues of books by vice presidential candidates Joseph Lieberman
(''In Praise of Public Life'') and Dick Cheney (''Kings of the
Hill: Power and Personality in the House of Representatives'').
</P>
<P>
   Also this fall, Tom Wolfe comments on contemporary culture in
''Hooking Up,'' Matt Drudge sums up his life -- so far -- in ''Drudge
Manifesto'' and Ted Koppel looks back at recent news events in
''Off Camera.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the market remains tiny, some titles will be available
only as e-books. They include ''Blair Witch: Graveyard Shift,''
which anticipates November's sequel to ''The Blair Witch Project,''
and the science fiction series ''Star Trek S.C.E.'' Stephen King
fans can expect more installments of his online novel, ''The
Plant.''
</P>
<P>
   Back on paper, King remembers his near fatal car accident in
''On Writing'' and Mary Karr, author of the best-selling ''The
Liar's Club,'' writes about her teen-age years in ''Cherry.'' J.D.
Salinger's daughter, Margaret, reflects on her family in ''Dream
Catcher.'' The McCourt franchise continues with ''Singing Him My
Song,'' Malachy's McCourt sequel to ''A Monk Swimming.''
</P>
<P>
   Memoirs also are due from historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., the
late football star Walter Payton, Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli,
Natalie Cole, Jerry Butler, the Neville Brothers, Jerry Stiller,
Tina Sinatra and the pro wrestler Chyna.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bellow'' is James Atlas' highly anticipated biography of Nobel
laureate Saul Bellow. Ian Kershaw, author of an acclaimed history
about Hitler's rise to power, is coming out with the second volume.
David Levering Lewis completes his two-volume series on civil
rights pioneer W.E.B. DuBois. Other biography subjects this fall
include President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Robert Kennedy, George
Orwell and Robert E. Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The fiction list seems especially strong, with books expected
from Margaret Atwood, Ha Jin, Carlos Fuentes, William Trevor,
Michael Chabon, John Updike, Kazuo Ishiguro, Jane Hamilton, Caleb
Carr, Alice Walker and Nobelists Gunter Grass and Jose Saramago.
Notable new authors include Bonnie Burnard, Nomi Eve, Allen B.
Ballard and F.X. Toole.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee Williams fans should look for a collection of his
letters and a volume of his early plays. Also expected are the
letters of Dashiell Hammett, essays by Arthur Miller, stories from
Isaac Bashevis Singer and the original, unedited version of Thomas
Wolfe's novel, ''Look Homeward, Angel,'' published upon the
centennial of the author's birth.
</P>
<P>
   Among commercial titles, the biggest seller could well be ''The
Mark: The Beast Rules the World,'' the latest apocalyptic thriller
from Jerry B. Jenkins and Tim F. LaHaye. Other names to look for
include Anne Rice, Tami Hoag, Elmore Leonard, Johanna Lindsey,
Richard Paul Evans, Colleen McCullough, Patricia Cornwall and
Philip Margolin.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the season's more unusual titles could be labeled
detective stories. In ''Author Unknown: On the Trail of
Anonymous,'' handwriting expert Don Foster reveals how he unmasked
''Primary Colors'' novelist Joe Klein. ''The Island of Lost Maps''
follows the cartographic trail of Gilbert Bland, Jr., an antiques
dealer with an unfortunate passion for stealing vintage maps from
research libraries throughout the United States and Canada.

   ''Island'' has a first printing of about 50,000 and author Miles
Harvey already suspects who some of those readers will be. He
recalls speaking to a gathering of librarians at last June's
BookExpo America. He told a true tale of horror, about Bland and
Gary Menges, a librarian at the University of Washington who had
spent five years trying to save a copy of ''America,'' an
encyclopedia and atlas of the United States from 1672.
</P>
<P>
   ''Menges raised the money by himself to preserve this book,''
Harvey says. ''He even threw in $50 of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ''For months, no one asked about the book. But one day a guy who
identified himself as 'James Perry' walked into the library. Menges
happened to be working at the research desk and when this fellow
requested 'America,' Menges got all excited. He said, 'I sure hope
you like this book.'
</P>
<P>
   ''When I got to the part of the map being dislodged from the
book, there was an audible gasp from all those librarians in the
room. It was extraordinary. I think this book will do very well
with librarians.''

<HEADLINE> Fall Preview: Verdi Dominates Season  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Come Jan. 27, the music of Giuseppe Verdi will
fill the opera houses and concert halls of the world, celebrating
the 100th anniversary of his death with his ''Requiem'' and
performances of his 28 operas.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most human composer after Mozart,'' Sir Georg Solti said a
few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The music world certainly agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Without Wagner's pomposity, and with more intensity than Mozart,
Verdi created enduring works from 1839-93. The anniversary of his
death has caused opera companies and symphonies to center not only
the 2000-01 season around him, but in many cases 2001-02, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are about human beings, these are about human emotions,
these are about people with which you can be empathetic,'' Donald
Runnicles, music director of the San Francisco Opera, said last
week. ''It's great music, great tunes. It's always music that can
be sung in a taverna or whistled in the streets. There's something
eminently approachable about the characters.
</P>
<P>
   ''That in contrast to a Richard Wagner, who created dwarfs and
giants and larger-than-life characters, mythical figures.''
</P>
<P>
   The ''Requiem,'' which Verdi wrote in 1874 and dedicated to
Italian novelist Alessandro Manzoni, will be played Jan. 27 by the
Berlin Philharmonic (chief conductor Claudio Abbado with soloists
Angela Gheorghiu, Roberto Alagna, Daniela Barcellona and Julian
Konstantinov); the Bavarian State Opera Orchestra in Munich,
Germany (Zubin Mehta conducting Andrea Bocelli, Renee Fleming, Rene
Pape and Dolora Zajick); and the Symphony Orchestra of Madrid,
Spain (Garcia Navarro conducting Silvie Valayre, Alicia Nafe, Johan
Botha and Erwin Schott).
</P>
<P>
   Later in the season, the ''Requiem'' will be played by the State
Opera, Unter der Linden in Berlin (April 13 with Daniel Barenboim
conducting Jane Eaglen, Waltraud Meier, Botha and Eldar Aliev); the
Chicago Symphony Orchestra (April 24, 26, 28 with Barenboim
conducting Deborah Voigt, Violeta Urmana, Botha and Pape); the
Metropolitan Opera Orchestra (April 29 at Carnegie Hall, with James
Levine conducting Fleming, Pape, Olga Borodina and Marcello
Giordani); the Vienna Philharmonic (May 19 at the State Opera with
conductor Riccardo Muti, Urmana, Miriam Gauci, Giuseppe Sabbatini
and Alastair Miles); and the Concertgebouw of Amsterdam at Paris'
Chatelet Theatre (May 31 with Riccardo Chailly conducting Barbara
Frittoli, Violeta Urmana, Acquiles Machado and Orlin Anastassov).
</P>
<P>
   The Concertgebouw, with Inez Salazar replacing Frittoli, repeats
the program the next day in Toulouse, France.
</P>
<P>
   The Teatro La Fenice in Venice, Italy, will perform the
''Requiem'' on Dec. 5, 7, 9, 12 and 14; the Opera de Monte Carlo
will perform it on Jan. 19 and 21; the San Diego Opera on May 19
(Edoardo Mueller conducting Elena Zelenskaya, Marianne Cornetti,
Richard Leech and Kevin Langan); and the Sarasota Opera in Florida
on Jan. 26 and 28.
</P>
<P>
   As for Verdi's staged works, the Metropolitan Opera has a new
''Il Trovatore'' opening Dec. 7. Carlo Rizzi conducts Marina
Mescheriakova, Dolora Zajick, Neil Shicoff, Roberto Frontal and
Dimitri Kavrakos in a production by the controversial Graham Vick,
whose garishly colored ''Falstaff'' last year reopened The Royal
Opera, Covent Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Luciano Pavarotti makes his only scheduled U.S. opera
appearances of the season -- and, perhaps, his last ever -- at the
Met in ''Aida,'' starting Jan. 15, with Voigt in the title role and
Levine conducting. The matinee performance on Jan. 27 will be
broadcast live around the world.
</P>
<P>
   On March 8, for the first time since 1960, the Met will stage
''Nabucco.'' Levine conducts a cast that includes Maria Guleghina,
Marianna Tarasova, Fabio Armiliato, Juan Pons and Samuel Ramey in a
new Elijah Moshinsky production.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Met revives ''A Masked Ball'' and ''La
Traviata.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lyric Opera of Chicago has a new Christopher Alden
production of ''Rigoletto'' on Oct. 21, with Fabuo Luisi conducting
Alexandru Agache, Andrea Rost, Ramon Vargas and Jennifer Dudley.
</P>
<P>
   ''Attila,'' not performed with great frequency, is revived for
Ramey in a Moshinsky production that returns to Chicago on Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Opera has a new Francesca Zambello production
of ''Luisa Miller'' opening its season Sept. 9, with Runnicles
conducting Patricia Racette, Elena Zaremba, Giordani and Paolo
Gavanelli.
</P>
<P>
   And a ''new'' David Edwards production of ''Simon Boccanegra,''
borrowed from Covent Garden, opens June 19 with Runnicles
conducting Carol Vaness, Gavanelli, Giordani, Ramey and Nicolai
Putilin. There also is a revival of ''La Traviata.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the smaller companies, the Houston Grand Opera, borrowing
a production from San Francisco, has a strongly cast ''Don Carlo''
starting April 20 (Vargas, Ramey, Racette, Dwayne Croft, Beatrice
Uria-Monzon and Patrick Summers conducting).
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Opera stages ''Falstaff''; the Los Angeles Opera
presents ''Aida'' with Voigt and Botha (in a production borrowed
from Houston); and the Washington Opera stages ''Don Carlo'' (in a
production borrowed from Chicago) and ''Il Trovatore'' (a
co-production with Los Angeles and the Goeteborg Opera in Sweden).
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the New York Grand Opera Company began performing all
28 Verdi operas in the order in which they were composed, a feat
never before attempted. Next summer, Vincent La Selva, who has
conducted all 25 so far, will present ''Aida,'' ''Otello'' and
''Falstaff.'' On Jan. 27, the 100th anniversary of Verdi's death,
La Selva will conduct his ''Requiem'' at Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, Verdi is celebrated at La Scala in Milan, which opens
its season Dec. 7 with Muti conducting Leo Nucci, Barbara Frittoli
and Urmana in a new Hugo De Ana production of ''Il Trovatore.''
</P>
<P>
   Muti, La Scala's music director, also conducts a new production
of ''A Masked Ball'' and revivals of ''Rigoletto,'' ''La
Traviata,'' ''Macbeth'' and ''Falstaff,'' with the latter
performances at Verdi's hometown of Busseto on April 10 and 12.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, the most ambitious tribute is in Austria, where from
Jan. 8-31 the Vienna State Opera presents nightly performances from
among 12 Verdi operas: ''Aida,'' ''A Masked Ball,'' ''Don Carlo,''
''Ernani,'' ''Jerusalem.'' ''Macbeth,'' ''Otello,'' ''Rigoletto,''
''Stiffelio,'' ''La Traviata,'' ''Il Trovatore'' and ''I Vespri
Siciliani''
</P>
<P>
   In Munich, the Bavarian State Opera presents a Verdi festival
from Jan. 16-28, with Mehta conducting a new Eike Gramss production
of ''Falstaff'' starring Bryn Terfel, Elizabeth Futral and Patricia
Risley. Mehta also leads revivals of ''Don Carlo'' and ''Otello,''
while John Fiore conducts ''Aida.''
</P>
<P>
   The Deutsche Oper Berlin presents 16 Verdi performances from
Jan. 7-Feb. 4, staging ''A Masked Ball,'' ''Falstaff,'' ''Luisa
Miller,'' ''Nabucco'' ''La Traviata'' and ''Il Trovatore.''
</P>
<P>
   In London, The Royal Opera stages three revivals -- ''Falstaff,''
''La Traviata'' and ''Otello'' with Argentinean tenor Jose Cura
singing the title role under the baton of Daniele Gatti starting
April 19.
</P>
<P>
   Cura also sings in the Vienna ''Otello'' and in a Juergen Flimm
production at the Chatelet starting March 26 (Myung-Whun Chung
conducting Karita Mattila and Anthony Michaels-Moore).
</P>
<P>
   The Opera de Paris has revivals of ''Nabucco'' and ''Don
Carlo,'' and the Chatelet presents ''Falstaff'' with Sir John Eliot
Gardiner conducting the Revolutionary and Romantic Orchestra and
Jean-Philippe Lafont, Juan Diego Flore, Michaels-Moore and Rebecca
Evans.
</P>
<P>
   The Teatro Real in Madrid has new productions of ''Don Carlo''
(Roberto Scandiuzzi, Neil Shicoff, Dario Volonte, Dmitri
Hvorostovsky and Navarro conducting) and ''Il Trovatore'' (Navarro
conducting Cura, Michele Crider, Carlo Guelfi and Nina Terentieva).
The Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona has a new production of ''A
Masked Ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the music labels, a new recording of the ''Requiem'' is
being released by Universal Classics, with Valery Gergiev
conducting the Kirov Opera Orchestra and Bocelli, Fleming, Borodina
and Ildebrando D'Arcangelo. Universal also is releasing a Verdi
disk by Bocelli with Mehta conducting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Aroldo'' (Shicoff and Vaness), ''Jerusalem'' (Giordani) and
''Alzira'' (Mescheriakova, Gavanelli and Vargas) will be released
by Philips, leaving the original French version of ''Les Vespres
Sicillennes'' as the only Verdi opera not available on CD.
</P>
<P>
   As for other composers, the Met has new stagings of Beethoven's

Gambler.'' The Met season starts Sept. 25 with Levine conducting
Fleming and Terfel in Mozart's ''Don Giovanni.''

   Chicago has new productions of Tchaikovsky's ''The Queen of
Spades,'' Janacek's ''Jenufa'' and Wagner's ''The Flying
Dutchman,'' and imports the Met's world premiere production of John
Harbison's ''The Great Gatsby,'' which opened to mixed reviews last
December.
</P>
<P>
   Also this season, Voigt sings the title role in Puccini's
''Tosca'' for the first time, at the Florida Grand Opera in Miami,
with Renata Scotto directing. At the Baltimore Opera, Scotto sings

<HEADLINE> Angels, Ogres, Witches in New Movies  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Loads of comedy. Horror. Animation. And all
that serious stuff by movie types hoping to bag an Oscar. This is
Hollywood serving up its usual fall feast.
</P>
<P>
   But amid the crowd of year-end movies, aren't we all really
waiting to hear two catch phrases culled from the small screen:
''Good morning, Angels'' and ''You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch''?
</P>
<P>
   Two of the year's most anticipated movies hit theaters in
November. ''Charlie's Angels'' arrives Nov. 3, with Drew Barrymore,
Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu starring as the trio of glamorous
detectives in this update of the campy 1970s TV series. Bill Murray
co-stars as office bean counter Bosley, and John Forsythe is back
as the voice of the Angels' wealthy, mysterious boss.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Nov. 17, Hollywood goes Whoville with ''Dr. Seuss' How
the Grinch Stole Christmas,'' starring Jim Carrey as that holiday
ogre with spiders in his brain and a heart full of unwashed socks,
who simply must find a way to stop Christmas. The live-action
adaptation of the children's book and TV chestnut from the 1960s
co-stars Molly Shannon, Jeffrey Tambor, Christine Baranski and
Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou Who.
</P>
<P>
   ''The great thing about the Grinch is he's a little manic, kind
of a kook, kind of crazy. Jim devised a multidimensional, very
entertaining Grinch that's not just a one-note grouch,'' director
Ron Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   Other fall highlights:
</P>
<P>
   Sports: Denzel Washington as a football coach in ''Remember the
Titans''; Robert Redford's golfing fable ''The Legend of Bagger
Vance,'' with Will Smith and Matt Damon.
</P>
<P>

Witch 2,'' about thrill-seekers visiting the woods depicted in the
blockbuster first film; ''Wes Craven Presents: Dracula 2000,''

Legends: Final Cut.''

Day''; Carrie-Anne Moss and Val Kilmer as Mars adventurers in ''Red
Planet.''
</P>

d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival.

Groove,'' featuring the voices of David Spade, John Goodman and
Eartha Kitt; another entry borrowed from Japan, ''Digimon: The

the steamy ''Original Sin''; Damon again in the adaptation of the
best seller ''All the Pretty Horses''; Glenn Close's return as
Cruella De Vil in ''102 Dalmatians''; ''Bounce,'' with Gwyneth
Paltrow and Ben Affleck in a romance that arises from a plane
crash; and Sally Field's directorial debut with ''Beautiful,''

</P>
<P>
   There's ''Get Carter,'' starring Sylvester Stallone as a mobster
investigating his brother's death; Michael Douglas and Catherine
Zeta-Jones in the drug saga ''Traffic,'' directed by Steven
Soderbergh; ''Miss Congeniality,'' with Sandra Bullock playing an
FBI agent undercover as a beauty contestant; Cate Blanchett, Hilary
Swank and Keanu Reeves in the spooky Southern thriller ''The
Gift''; and ''The Yards,'' a crime drama starring Mark Wahlberg.

</P>
<P>
   Joel and Ethan Coen return with ''O Brother, Where Art Thou?'',
a 1930s retelling of Homer's ''The Odyssey'' focusing on three
chain-gang escapees. George Clooney, John Turturro, Holly Hunter
and John Goodman co-star.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Coen's wife, Frances McDormand, is back with a reissue of
the overlooked ''Wonder Boys'' from last winter and a stellar role
in ''Almost Famous,'' the first film by writer-director Cameron
Crowe since ''Jerry Maguire.''
</P>
<P>
   McDormand plays a character based on Crowe's mother in the
autobiographical story of the director's adventures as a
15-year-old music writer for Rolling Stone in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've read a few mother roles in my life. Ever since I was 25,
I've been offered mother roles,'' McDormand said. ''I haven't done
that many because I'm not interested in generic roles. That didn't
really interest me. But this one, she's full, she's complete. She
quotes Goethe, for God's sake. It was heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   After a long layoff since her Oscar-winning performance in
1997's ''As Good As It Gets,'' Helen Hunt returns in a big way,
appearing in four films.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt co-stars with Richard Gere in Robert Altman's ''Dr. T &AMP; the
Women,'' the story of a gynecologist with lady trouble; with Kevin
Spacey and Haley Joel Osment in ''Pay It Forward,'' the tale of a
scarred teacher's unusual relationship with a boy and his mother;
with Mel Gibson in ''What Women Want,'' about an ad exec who uses
his newfound mind-reading skills to his advantage; and with Tom
Hanks in Robert Zemeckis' ''Cast Away,'' the story of a man
stranded on an island after a plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just very busy this past year,'' said Hunt, who took a
year and a half off after ''As Good As It Gets'' and the final
season of her TV series ''Mad About You.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't really find anything that interested me for a while,
then they all just kind of came in, bang, bang, bang, bang. It was
great because they were all different parts and different kinds of
movies and directors, and needed a different process for each
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert De Niro has two films coming. In ''Men of Honor,'' he
plays reluctant mentor to the Navy's first black master diver (Cuba
Gooding Jr.). In the comedy ''Meet the Parents,'' De Niro is an
ex-CIA profiler casting a cold eye on his daughter's jittery
prospective husband (Ben Stiller).
</P>
<P>
   ''De Niro's on him like only De Niro can get on him,'' director
Jay Roach said. ''He's the sort of guy you'd imagine has fat
dossiers on every single boyfriend who's ever come through.''
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan re-teams with his ''The Sixth
Sense'' star Bruce Willis for ''Unbreakable,'' another flick with
supernatural elements. Willis plays the sole survivor of a train
wreck, who comes through without a scratch. His ''Die Hard With a
Vengeance'' sidekick Samuel L. Jackson plays a stranger offering a
bizarre explanation for his survival.
</P>
<P>
   It's a different game for Shyamalan, with expectations through
the roof after ''The Sixth Sense'' surprised Hollywood by grossing
$300 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to hit it out of the park for people to be happy,''
Shyamalan said.
</P>
<P>
   Has he achieved that with ''Unbreakable''?
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope, man,'' Shyamalan said.
</P>
<P>
   John Travolta faces the opposite situation; anything is bound to
be an improvement over last spring's ''Battlefield Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Travolta returns with a more promising role in the lottery scam
''Lucky Numbers,'' a dark comedy directed by Nora Ephron and
co-starring Lisa Kudrow. The movie is loosely based on a real-life
scheme to rig the lottery. Travolta's character, a TV weatherman,
enlists the help of the station's lotto-ball girl (Kudrow), a woman
with a serious criminal streak, Ephron said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have never seen her do this. She makes Barbara Stanwyck
look sweet,'' Ephron said. ''Lisa's the kind of person who can play
someone sort of pathologically evil and still have you like her.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of evil, the devil gets his due with a slew of demonic
thrillers and comedies. Adam Sandler plays Satan's addlebrained son
in ''Little Nicky,'' a comedy that pits him against his devilish
older brothers. Elizabeth Hurley gives the devil a bombshell body
in ''Bedazzled,'' co-starring Brendan Fraser as a chump who sells
his soul for wealth and fame. There's a new cut of the horror
classic ''The Exorcist,'' plus added footage and improved sound.
''Lost Souls'' stars Winona Ryder as a woman trying to prevent a
satanic conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Lost souls bring us back to the Grinch. The movie features a
score by Oscar winner James Horner (''Titanic'') and two songs from
the TV cartoon including ''You're a Mean One,'' which Carrey's
Grinch sings as a soliloquy on his own wickedness.
</P>
<P>
   In this version, the meanness of the Grinch, a ''sort of
ultimately benign misanthrope,'' stems from deep-seated hurts in
his past, director Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   The film adds some new characters and fills in the back story of
how the Grinch arrived in Whoville, what prompted him to live alone
in a cave and, most important, what stirred his hatred for the
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ''We plant the seeds for his outrage at Christmas and his
annoyance with the Whos and show that it's not just a petty thing
with him,'' Howard said. ''It runs deep.''

<HEADLINE> Author Tells About Bout With Cancer  </HEADLINE>
By MARTHA WAGGONER
<TEXT>
<P>
   HILLSBOROUGH, N.C. (AP) -- He's a snake-handling ex-Marine who
wears metallic blue nail polish on his big toes, a heavy drinker
who swore off alcohol almost overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Tim McLaurin is also a man who had lived such a full life that,
until love unexpectedly knocked at the door a few months ago, he
was ready to die.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wondered if my role at that point was that it was time for
me to die (and) to chronicle that in writing, straightforward and
honestly, and I was willing to do that,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Not many would envy McLaurin his life. But anyone who has ever
waved at the parade instead of leading the band would envy his
courage to not only live it, but revel in it.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up poor, shooting squirrels and birds for dinner, a way
of life chronicled his 1991 childhood memoir, ''Keeper of the
Moon,'' a tribute to a disappearing rural South. He's one of six
children whose father was a machine operator at a bakery and a
part-time farmer and whose mother was a housewife.
</P>
<P>
   The book won a local award for nonfiction and was included on
The New York Times list of the best books of the year.
</P>
<P>
   At 18, he joined the Marine Corps, which he considered his only
chance to see a part of the world other than North Carolina. He's
been married and divorced twice, and has two teen-age children. He
was a Peace Corps volunteer in Tunisia and a traveling snake
showman in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He went to college intermittently, finally graduating in 1985
from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. From grammar
school on, he showed a talent for writing, but he mostly let that
talent lay dormant until college. Author Doris Betts mentored
McLaurin on his first novel, ''The Acorn Plan,'' which won a state
prize for fiction writing.
</P>
<P>
   By the age of 44, both of his hips had been replaced because of
arthritis, a result of treatment for multiple myeloma, a type of
cancer formed by malignant plasma cells. His battle with the cancer
10 years ago, including a bone marrow transplant from a brother,
culminated in a four-day canoe trip down the Neuse River to raise
awareness for the need for bone marrow donors.
</P>
<P>
   The trip, he says, was a way to get back to his real life after
eight months in the sterile world of hospitals. ''It was just total
solitude, and it was just exactly what I needed,'' he says, despite
rain that fell so hard the first day that he had to bail out the
canoe with an empty Spam can.
</P>
<P>
   Less well-known is his bout in the past year with cancer of the
esophagus.
</P>
<P>
   The diagnosis and treatment required a 15-page epilogue for his
seventh book, ''The River Less Run,'' a chronicle of his life from
June 1998 to June 1999, to be released in September by North
Carolina-based Down Home Press.
</P>
<P>
   It was in November, when swallowing became painful, that he was
diagnosed with esophageal cancer. He underwent two rounds of
chemotherapy and one of radiation. Cancer of the esophagus is a
take-no-prisoners kind of disease: life expectancy beyond five
years after diagnosis is only about 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet McLaurin's doctors have declared him free of it. The
46-year-old McLaurin again may have beaten death.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't his plan at first. This time, he had wondered if it
was time to die. His children were old enough to have memories of
him, his book was finished, what he thought was his last trip West
was finished and he wasn't involved with a woman.
</P>
<P>
   When a record-setting two feet of snow fell on North Carolina in
January, he took it as an omen. He had always dreamed of such a
snowfall and thought it might have foretold his death. More than
anything, he was simply tired.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just didn't want to deal with the hassle of being sick. I
didn't want to deal with being poked and prodded and that loss of
privacy,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   What turned him around was the arrival of Carol Quaine, a friend
of a friend who says she felt called to McLaurin's door.
</P>
<P>
   Even she fits in with McLaurin's contradictory life. By
profession, she does free-lance statistical analysis and is
finishing her doctorate in business. By calling, she's a healer
trained in Reiki, a healing technique developed in Japan by a
Buddhist monk in the late 1700s and early 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   She arrived one day in mid-February and offered the touch of her
healing hands.
</P>
<P>
   McLaurin says the first time she placed her hands on his chest,
he thought she was using a heating pad. ''Almost everyday for three
weeks she returned and placed her hands upon me, wafted fragrant
smoke upon my body, lit candles and rang bells,'' he wrote in a
newspaper story. ''She told me that sometimes when I talked to her,
leaves and feathers fell in a shower from above my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Her love and trust made him rethink his reluctance to fight. ''I
started thinking maybe your story isn't to end right here, to tell
people how to die. Maybe you've got other stories to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither credits Quaine alone with saving McLaurin's life. She
says he was cured ''by some of the best Western medicine and some
of the deepest love.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaurin wants to memorialize his survival by having a phoenix
tattooed on his chest where he received radiation. The bird will
join tattoos of family names, flowers and animals that adorn his
right arm and the snakes and birds on his left arm.
</P>
<P>
   The toenails are a simpler matter. The first time, a young
visitor painted his two big toenails a metallic blue, a color
favored by halter-topped teens. Since then, he and Quaine have
repainted them a couple of times.
</P>
<P>
   ''I kind of like it,'' McLaurin says. ''Some people might look
at it and think it's weird, but I don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as a child, McLaurin was willing to be the odd man, to
question what he was told. He was taught that snakes were to be
feared and killed. But when he chopped up a harmless rat snake, he
felt guilty enough to read about snakes, learning that most of what
he had been taught was a myth.
</P>
<P>
   ''Snakes,'' he says, ''represent a way of overcoming ignorance
and fear. And overcoming ignorance in small steps is a way to fix a
lot of what's wrong with the world.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, he finds comfort in the world he and Carol have made in
Hillsborough with McLaurin's bulldog, Roy Lee, his red-tail boa,
bull and Gaboon viper snakes and an African spur-footed tortoise
named George.
</P>
<P>
   He smokes two cigars a day -- 45-cent Phillies Blunts that he
prefers to Cuban cigars. ''I don't see that big a difference,'' he
says. ''Maybe I cropped so much tobacco growing up that I'm immune
to the finer qualities.''
</P>
<P>
   What he doesn't do anymore is drink. He went on an epic drunk in
November 1998 that landed him in the hospital. He says it was
deliberate -- one last blowout so he could walk away from the bottle
once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   ''I used that part of my life up until it was dust in my palm
and I could blow it away and it was gone,'' McLaurin says.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes his children live their lives as he has, with a sense
of adventure, a courage to look death in the eye without flinching
and to walk away with the will to live.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope they want to travel and seek and explore -- I hope they
make it to the moon,'' he says. ''I always thought that during my
lifetime, I'd make it to the moon -- that by the age of 46, there
were Pan-Am excursions to the moon. But we stopped going to the
moon.''

<HEADLINE> Poland Solidarity Has 20th Birthday  </HEADLINE>
By MONIKA SCISLOWSKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   GDANSK, Poland (AP) -- Solidarity union members gave a standing
ovation to founder Lech Walesa at a congress Wednesday marking the
20th birthday of the former East Bloc's first independent labor
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Solidarity sprang up in 1980 in a wave of strikes that began the
demise of communism. Wednesday's congress gathered more than 2,000
former and present union members, including Walesa and other
leaders of the historic strikes as well as advisers like Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, Poland's first post-communist premier.
</P>
<P>
   Walesa was cheered by the crowd as he entered the one-day
congress, held at a Gdansk sports hall. He took a front-row seat
along with Marian Krzaklewski, his successor as union chairman --
and rival long-shot candidate in this fall's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   In a message read by Gdansk Cardinal Tadeusz Goclowski,
Polish-born Pope John Paul II gave thanks for ''all the good which
those two decades brought to our homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   Solidarity toppled the communist system in 1989 and has held
power since then except for a 1993-97 hiatus. The movement has
carried out democratic and market reforms to transform Poland from
an inefficient communist country into a modern, Western-style
nation.
</P>
<P>
   However, the reforms, which filled stores with consumer goods
and brought $40 billion in foreign investment, also caused
dissatisfaction among many social groups. Growing unemployment and
a shrinking social safety net have resulted recently in a sharp
decline in public support for Solidarity, which itself is now
plagued by divisions and internal feuding over power and influence.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech, Walesa stressed how much Solidarity activists had
accomplished. He urged them to stay united and ''on the side of
Poland.''
</P>
<P>
   The charismatic strike leader who became Poland's first
post-communist president avoided directly addressing Solidarity's
divisions.
</P>
<P>
   A much more dramatic analysis came from Prime Minister Jerzy
Buzek, a Solidarity activist. He appealed for a return to historic
Solidarity ideals in the face of opinion polls showing President
Aleksander Kwasniewski, an ex-communist, could easily get
re-elected in the Oct. 8 balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Solidarity has tenuous control of Poland's parliament, but
Kwasniewski looks likely to keep his hold on the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be a lack of responsibility for the country if we
ignored clear signs that today this force (ex-communists) is even
closer to a monopoly of power,'' Buzek said. ''The way to avoid it
is unity.''
</P>
<P>
   The congress is a part of three days of festivities marking the
anniversary. The celebration began Tuesday with the opening of the
exhibition ''Roads to Freedom'' at the historic Gdansk shipyard,
where Solidarity was born in August 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight comes Thursday with commemorations marking the
signing of the so-called Gdansk Agreement. That pact, meant to
bring more freedom and better conditions for workers, ended a
two-week nationwide strike and marked Solidarity's beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements were signed by Walesa, then a little-known
shipyard electrician who led the strikers, and communist Deputy
Prime Minister Mieczyslaw Jagielski. But Poland's communist rulers
backed away from the deal in December 1981 and tried to crush the
union with martial law. It took eight more years of steady
resistance before Solidarity toppled the regime.

<HEADLINE> Actor Renfro Charged With Theft  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Actor Brad Renfro was charged with
grand theft after allegedly trying to steal a yacht the day before
filming was to begin on his latest movie.
</P>
<P>
   Two people sleeping in a nearby boat were awoken by the sound of
an engine at about 4 a.m. Monday. They saw Renfro, 18, and a friend
trying to maneuver the 45-foot yacht away from the dock, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't untie the dock lines and the $175,000 boat was
yanked back into the dock, damaging its stern, authorities said.
The two people called authorities and held Renfro and Harold Bond,
24, until police arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Renfro was released from jail Monday night after posting $10,000
bail. Filming of the movie ''Bully'' began Tuesday. Bond remained
in jail Wednesday on $10,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Renfro struck a plea bargain on cocaine and marijuana
charges, agreeing to random testing for drugs. Police were
investigating whether he and Bond had been under the influence of
drugs or alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Renfro ''seemed to be the most distraught about being
arrested,'' said the boat's manager, Paul Roydhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Renfro was discovered as a fifth-grader and cast in the 1994
movie ''The Client,'' based on the John Grisham novel. He has
appeared in 12 films, including ''The Cure,'' ''Telling Lies in
America'' and ''Sleepers'' with Brad Pitt.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Legislator Lashes Out on Visa  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The president of Cuba's National Assembly says
the Clinton administration, by denying him a visa to attend an
international conference in New York, has shown contempt for him
and the gathering of parliamentarians he was to join.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also is violating its obligations to the
United Nations and to the Inter-Parliamentary Union by keeping him
from attending a four-day meeting beginning today of the presiding
officers of the group, the Cuban legislator, Ricardo Alarcon, said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. officials disclosed today that an Iranian
suspected of terrorism and two Yugoslavs also were denied visas to
attend the conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian, Mohsen Rezai, is suspected of masterminding the
bombing of a U.S. Marine Base in Lebanon in 1983 in which 241
Americans were killed and of participating in the takeover of the
U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Rezai currently serves on a council that reviews moves for
reform in the Majlis, the Iranian legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The officials declined to identify the two Yugoslavs also denied
visas, saying the information was confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, anticipating rejection of his visa application,
Alarcon wrote Anders Johnsson, the Inter-Parliamentary Union's
secretary-general, to request a response to the U.S. action.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible, the Cuban legislator said, ''to ignore the
contempt and lack of respect for our organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Two deputies in the Cuban assembly will be permitted to attend,
a U.S. official told The Associated Press on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 140 countries are expected to send delegations,
including many legislative leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Alarcon's visa was rejected under the provisions of a 1985
presidential proclamation that bars entry to the United States if
the visit is considered contrary to U.S. interests, said two U.S.
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Alarcon's personal assistant, Alberto Gonzalez Rodriguez, also
was denied a visa.
</P>
<P>
   However, visas were approved for assembly deputies Ramon Pez
Ferro and Ada Martinez. They are not senior Cuban officials and
therefore were considered qualified for entry under the
proclamation, one of the U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department spokesman, Philip Reeker, declined to
identify which Cubans were denied visas and which were receiving
them. He said he was bound by the ''confidentiality'' of the visa
process.
</P>
<P>
   However, Reeker confirmed that ''we have authorized issuance of
visas to some Cuban officials who applied to travel to this
interparliamentary Union event'' and ''determined not to issue
visas to some people that had applied.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Najma Heptulla, president of the
Inter-Parliamentary Council, which is the overseeing body of the
Inter-Parliamentary Union, called the U.S. decision to bar Alarcon
unfortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a conference of presiding officers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Heptulla said the United States, meanwhile, had not paid its
dues ''and we are working on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuba and the United States have limited diplomatic relations,
but Cuban officials have been permitted to travel here to attend
U.N. meetings in New York and to staff the small Cuban diplomatic
mission in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The parliamentary group is not a U.N. organization and therefore
the United States is not required by agreements with the United
Nations to issue visas to individuals attending the group's events
in News York, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Alarcon is scheduled to be the host of a formal
session of the parliamentary union in Havana in April.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Monday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright accused Cuba
of arbitrarily denying exit permits to Cubans with U.S. visas,
thereby separating families and forcing would-be immigrants to
attempt high-risk escapes by boat.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Albright said Cuba's actions violated agreements
with the United States, international standards and ''fundamental
human decency.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she ordered a formal protest lodged with Cuba's
diplomatic office in Washington. ''The government of Cuba is
increasingly obstructing the safe, legal and orderly migration of
individuals from Cuba,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Already-bumpy relations with Cuba declined amid a protracted and
touchy U.S. dispute with Cuban-Americans last spring over
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, the only survivor of a November boat
passage to Miami that also killed his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Elian returned to Cuba with his father June 28, after a lengthy
legal battle with emigre relatives in Florida. The Cuban government
cited the incident in June when it indefinitely suspended
immigration negotiations with the United States.

<HEADLINE> Delays Contributed to Russia TV Fire  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- As fire spread in the Russian capital's television
tower, firefighters had to wait three hours before getting
authorization to cut the tower's power supply, the city fire
service chief said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fire chief Leonid Korotchik said that firefighters battling the
weekend blaze had to climb a long ladder of command before finally
getting a personal cutoff order from President Vladimir Putin, even
though safety regulations call for an immediate power cut in such
fires.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we had cut the power earlier, we would probably have been
able to localize the fire,'' said fire chief Leonid Korotchik.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the fire lasted 26 hours, spreading through much of the
landmark 1,771-foot Ostankino Tower and knocking out almost all TV
service to the Moscow region's 15 million people for three days.
</P>
<P>
   The fire chief's account of the long delay comes on the heels of
widespread criticism of Putin and the Kremlin for a slow and
seemingly confused response to the sinking of the nuclear submarine
Kursk this month, in which 118 crewmen died.
</P>
<P>
   Korotchik said firefighters arrived at the tower within 10
minutes of receiving a call that smoke was seen streaming from its
upper reaches on Sunday afternoon. They quickly evacuated 300
people who were inside the tower, including scores of sightseers on
the observation deck and patrons in the restaurant at the
1,050-foot level, and climbed to 1,440 feet to fight the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to cut the power to the tower resulted in new
short-circuits that kindled new fires all along the giant tower,
Korotchik said. The 33-year-old tower lacked fire-prevention
systems in its hollow shaft, where the burning cables were located,
and the numerous short-circuits and pieces of burning cable
insulation quickly spread the fire downward.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Deputy Moscow Mayor Valery Shantsev, who arrived at
the scene, called Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, and he called Putin to get
the permission to switch the power off, Korotchik said. Putin
immediately gave the order.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shantsev called Luzhkov, then he called the president and the
power was cut off,'' he said at a news conference. He did not
explain why Putin's go-ahead was needed.
</P>
<P>
   Korotchik, who was among the firefighters high up in the tower,
said he and his men were at substantial risk as they tried to put
out the fire while the electricity was still on.
</P>
<P>
   ''We faced mortal danger,'' he said. '''But we wanted to save
this unique facility.''
</P>
<P>
   With elevators in a burning shaft still working, Vladimir
Arsyukov, who led a local fire service branch, got into one of them
to move down and try to localize the fire. But he got stuck inside
it together with the lift's 24-year-old operator and a tower
worker. The elevator apparently got stuck, then plunged 785 feet;
the three were found dead at the bottom of the shaft.
</P>
<P>
   Korotchik said the electrical cables in the tower caught fire
because they overheated, as the tower contained more equipment that
could be operated safely.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was huge overloading,'' he said. ''The cause is a run
for money.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has said the tower will be repaired and restored
as Moscow's chief broadcasting facility, but it has given no
timeframe for the work or its cost. Two state-run channels resumed
broadcasting over a single shared frequency on Wednesday evening,
using a temporary transmitter placed on the tower.

<HEADLINE> E. Timor Celebrates Independence  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL COONEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor (AP) -- In a day of tears and dancing, prayers
and forgiveness, war-weary East Timor marked the first anniversary
of the independence ballot that ended 24 years of bloody occupation
by Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   East Timorese leaders promised Wednesday to work hard to bring
democracy and a peaceful and prosperous future to the tiny
Southeast Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must come together to build this country,'' East Timor's
charismatic independence leader Jose ''Xanana'' Gusmao said after
he was re-elected as head of a coalition of pro-independence groups
-- making him the likely first president of East Timor when it
achieves full independence.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke before a cheering crowd in front of the rambling
seafront building that served over the years as the seat of
Portugal's colonial rule and Indonesia's occupation government. It
now houses the temporary United Nations administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will show to all the people that there is democracy,''
Gusmao said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the euphoria of the rally, for many it was also a time
to remember the sad and bloody past.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's U.S.-trained military invaded the former Portuguese
colony in 1975. Some 200,000 lives were lost to disease, famine and
military repression before the Aug. 30, 1999, referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Four-fifths of East Timorese voted for independence in the
U.N.-sponsored vote. The overwhelming result infuriated
pro-Indonesian militias, which reacted by murdering hundreds of
people and laying waste to much of the territory.
</P>
<P>
   The violence and destruction came to a halt after international
peacekeepers arrived in September.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations, which is administering East Timor during its
transition to independence, has started to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   Schools have been reopened and houses constructed. A democratic
administration is being set up.
</P>
<P>
   During a special anniversary Mass, Dili's Roman Catholic Bishop
Carlos Belo told a teary-eyed congregation to pray for ''the heroes
who died for our liberation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We must forgive our enemies, the Indonesian generals, the
autonomy leaders, those who support integration (with Indonesia)
and the militia commanders,'' Belo said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, thousands gathered at Dili's Santa Cruz cemetery, the
scene of a 1991 massacre that focused the world's attention on the
brutality of Indonesian rule. They placed floral wreaths and pink
and white bougainvillea petals around a simple black steel cross at
the site.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are at the resting place of those who gave their lives so
that East Timor can be free,'' said Jose Ramos-Horta, who shared a
Nobel Peace Prize with Belo in 1996. ''Those who survived have the
burden of building a better East Timor, a country that is worth the
sacrifice of so many.''
</P>
<P>
   Security was tight in Dili as heavily armed peacekeepers stood
guard amid fears that militia groups might try to disrupt
anniversary celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   In West Timor, some 2,000 militiamen staged a noisy protest to
demand that Indonesia's ex-President B.J. Habibie be tried for
treason for allowing the Aug. 30 referendum.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Fighting Drugs in Colombia  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) -- In a show of solidarity, President
Clinton visited Colombia Wednesday with $1.3 billion in U.S. aid
aimed at propping up the South American nation's fight against
drugs, insurgents and recession.
</P>
<P>
   His nine-hour visit was confined to the scenic Caribbean port
city of Cartagena, site of a major hemispheric drug summit 10 years
ago and far from the violence and poppy and coca fields that yield
much of the cocaine and heroin used in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's trip sought to boost Colombian President Andres
Pastrana's $7.5 billion initiative to ease the narco-traffickers'
grip on his nation, make peace with insurgents financed by drug
profits, rev up the economy and strengthen the justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stepped off Air Force One to a red-carpet welcome, his
daughter, Chelsea, clutching his arm. The U.S. delegation, totaling
about 35, included 11 members of Congress, including House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, and officials, including Attorney General Janet
Reno, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Barry McCaffrey,
director of the National Drug Control Policy office.
</P>
<P>
   Residents lined the streets along Clinton's route, cheering and
waving large U.S. and Colombian flags.
</P>
<P>
   ''Colombia's democracy is under attack,'' Clinton said in an
address televised to Colombians on the eve of his visit. ''Profits
from the drug trade fund civil conflict. Powerful forces make their
own law, and you face danger every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was spending all his time in Cartagena, a 467-year-old
coastal city with churches, monasteries and shaded plazas. Situated
on the northern tip of Colombia, Cartagena is 400 miles from the
nation's capital, Bogota, and a relative oasis from the guerrilla
and paramilitary violence that wracks the country.
</P>
<P>
   His stay is short partly because of security concerns in a
nation the State Department calls one of the most violent in the
world. Ninety percent of the cocaine in the U.S. market and
two-thirds of the heroin on the East Coast comes from Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's first stop was a tour of the Port of Cartagena where
he patted a drug-sniffing dog and was briefed on drug-interdiction
efforts, met with Colombian National Police and talked with widows
of police officers killed in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   His trip also included a tour of a low-income neighborhood to
see Casa de Justicia, one of 20 centers funded by the U.S. Agency
for International Development that gives Colombia's poor greater
access to the justice system. People can walk into these centers
and see ombudsmen, social workers, public defenders, mediators and
others who can help them resolve civil and criminal matters.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to bolster law and order in a country overrun by
lawlessness.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana himself was kidnapped by the Medellin drug cartel in
the late 1980s and freed in a dramatic rescue. But besides fighting
drug traffickers, the one-time mayor of Bogota and former fellow at
Harvard University is trying to nudge the nation out of recession.
</P>
<P>
   Economic growth declined 3.5 percent in 1999, although it was up
by 2.2 percent in the first quarter of this year. Unemployment
reached 20 percent in mid-1999, but is on the decline.
</P>
<P>
   Elected on a peace platform, Pastrana also is trying to
negotiate an end to hostilities with Marxist guerillas and
right-wing paramilitary groups. In conflict with the state for 36
years, both engage in kidnapping and other acts of violence against
citizens, foreigners, the government and commercial installations,
such as oil pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very tough place,'' said Sandy Berger, Clinton's
national security adviser. ''I think we can either ... help
Colombia in its effort to deal with that problem, or stand back and
let Colombian democracy collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. part of Pastrana's ''Plan Colombia'' is aimed at
helping the Colombian military take control of cocaine-producing
regions held by the guerrillas and paramilitary groups. The U.S.
assistance includes funds for 60 combat helicopters and training
for the Colombian military, plus money for building schoolrooms,
water systems and roads, judicial reform and protecting human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Clinton waived conditions for the release of the U.S.

<HEADLINE> Feds Propose Yearly Gun Inventory  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federally licensed importers, manufacturers
and dealers of guns would have to conduct at least one inventory
each year to identify any missing firearms, under a rule proposed
by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal by the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms would ''help strengthen enforcement of federal
firearms laws and reduce the avenues in which violent criminals and
juveniles acquire illegal firearms,'' James Johnson, Treasury
undersecretary for enforcement, said in a statement Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 27,000 lost or stolen firearms were reported by
federal licensees between 1998 and 1999. Stolen firearms are a
''significant source of guns for criminals,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Inventory discrepancies, recordkeeping errors and employee
theft (problems which often only become apparent when a physical
inventory is conducted) accounted for almost 40 percent of the
reported incidents,'' ATF said in the Federal Register, which
published the proposal Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is subject to public comment and possible revision
before taking effect. Interested parties must weigh in by Nov. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Existing law requires licensed importers, manufacturers and
dealers to report any theft or loss of firearms from their
inventories to the ATF or appropriate local authorities within 48
hours after it is discovered.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would require licensees to do at least one annual
physical inventory of their firearms and reconcile that inventory
with their records. Any missing firearms would have to be reported
within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the proposal clarifies that when guns are lost in
transit or during shipment, it is the responsibility of the party
sending the firearms to report a stolen or missing gun. Existing
regulations do not specify whether the sending or receiving
licensee is responsible for making such a report.
</P>
<P>
   ''The lack of clarity ... may result in neither party reporting
the theft or loss,'' ATF said in its proposal.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, there were 1,271 crime guns traced in which the
licensee claimed that it never received the firearm shipped to it
and the firearm had not been reported lost or stolen, ATF said.

<HEADLINE> Confused UK Vigilantes Target Doctor  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLINE RNE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Vigilantes vandalized the home of a prominent
children's doctor in Wales, apparently after confusing her title of
pediatrician with ''pedophile,'' police said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Yvette Cloete, a specialist in pediatric medicine at the
Royal Gwent Hospital, fled her home after her windows and front
door were spray-painted with the word ''paedo'' -- an abbreviation
for the British spelling ''paedophile,'' said Karl Close, chief
inspector with the Gwent Police.
</P>
<P>
   ''Are they just so dull they don't realize the difference
between the two?'' Close said of the attack, which took place
Saturday. ''This is a pediatrician who is committed to helping
children and somebody targeted her.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain has seen a rash of vigilante attacks -- most against
victims of mistaken identity -- since The News of the World tabloid
published pictures of sex offenders this summer. Across Britain,
several people who shared surnames with alleged offenders named by
the paper also have had their homes attacked.
</P>
<P>
   The country has been obsessed with the subject of pedophiles
since July, when the naked body of an 8-year-old girl was
discovered in a south England field, two weeks after she
disappeared while playing outside.
</P>
<P>
   Cloete said she has moved into a friend's home and did not plan
to return to the rented house, where she lived with her 24-year-old
brother Andre. Police said they were satisfied neither sibling had
any connection to pedophilia and that the doctor was the intended
target of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is just unbelievable,'' she said Wednesday. ''It is
terrible that people think that they have the right to vandalize
your property like this no matter what you have done.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You think that your home is a place to go to be safe, so it is
a shock when something like this happens,'' Cloete said. ''I
suppose I'm really a victim of ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
   Close said police were making inquiries, but had not yet made
any arrests.
</P>
<P>
   In Portsmouth, England, 70 miles southwest of London, police
said five innocent families have so far been forced to leave their
homes after threats from neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   One man reportedly was suspected of pedophilia simply because he
lived alone and talked about how much he loved his mother.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, there have been isolated cases of
vigilante violence since passage in recent years of laws requiring
public notification about sex offenders.

<HEADLINE> Philippines To Get Tough On Rebels  </HEADLINE>
By BULLIT MARQUEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Muslim rebels threatened Wednesday
to behead an American they are holding captive, and the Philippine
government considered a tougher approach on hostage-takers, fearing
that ransoms paid for other hostages could encourage more
abductions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not joke,'' said Abu Sabaya, spokesman of the Abu Sayyaf
rebels. ''When we say we will behead someone, we will behead him.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels announced Tuesday they had abducted Jeffrey Schilling
of Oakland, Calif., said they would announce their demands in three
days, and warned they would kill Schilling if the United States
didn't accept.
</P>
<P>
   The extremist group is holding 18 other hostages on southern
Jolo island after releasing six Westerners earlier this week for a
reported $6 million paid by Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have warned that the large ransom payment will encourage
more kidnappings in the southern Philippines. Abu Sayyaf has
received more than $11.5 million in ransom for the releases of the
six hostages this week and other releases in recent months,
including another Westerner and nine Malaysians, according to
estimates by negotiators and the military.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot go on like this,'' said presidential executive
secretary Ronaldo Zamora. ''Otherwise we will be doing exactly what
those against ransom have been saying right from the beginning. We
are just setting ourselves up for more problems in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Several senators, including Senate President Franklin Drilon,
urged the government to consider military action against the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy said the American government would make no deal
with the rebels. ''We will not pay ransom, change policies, release
prisoners, or make any concessions that reward hostage-taking,'' it
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Radio Mindanao Network, Sabaya said the
guerrillas are willing to begin negotiations with U.S. Embassy
officials on Thursday for Schilling's release.
</P>
<P>
   But he demanded that representatives of North Korea, China,
Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Libya take part in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope this will proceed smoothly,'' he said Wednesday. ''We
are not afraid of a rescue operation by the Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling is being held by a faction of the hard-line Abu Sayyaf
group that kidnapped about 50 schoolchildren and teachers in March.
The group beheaded two teachers after the United States ignored
their demand for the release of Arab terrorists held in U.S. jails.
</P>
<P>
   Sabaya said the rebels believe Schilling is a CIA agent because
he introduced himself as a Muslim convert but knew little about
Islam.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Consul General John Caulfield called the allegation
''ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This individual is a completely innocent person who has been
unjustifiably seized,'' he said. ''We want to see his immediate
release and we look to the Philippine government to do everything
possible to secure that.''
</P>
<P>
   Zamora said the government had been forced to negotiate with the
Abu Sayyaf after they abducted 21 people, mostly foreigners, in
April because of pressure from their governments for a nonmilitary
solution. In contrast, he said, the United States has taken a more
aggressive approach.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling arrived in the Philippines March 8 and has been living
with his Muslim Filipino girlfriend, Ivi V. Osani, in Zamboanga.
</P>
<P>
   Osani's mother, Aida Ajijol, said Osani and Sabaya are second
cousins. Sabaya had invited the couple to visit the rebels' camp on
Jolo, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Oakland, Schilling's mother, Carol, said her son visited the
Philippines because of a longtime interest in the region but stayed
after he fell in love.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried to get him out of the country three times but he
didn't come out,'' she said. ''He was too much in love.''
</P>
<P>
   Police on Wednesday said Abu Sayyaf rebels have also kidnapped
their fourth young woman in less than a month -- a 16-year-old girl
on her way to school -- with the intention of forcing her to marry
an Abu Sayyaf member.
</P>
<P>
   The three other women -- a high school student, a teacher and a
midwife -- were kidnapped earlier this month for the same purpose,
police said.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Shares of brokerage companies surged Wednesday
following news that Credit Suisse had agreed to buy Donaldson,
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, but the overall market was mixed in lackluster
trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was off 91.75 to 11,123.35 in
midafternoon trading. The Nasdaq composite index was up 2.99 at
4,085.16, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 8.32 at
1,501.52.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerages and financial services stocks gained after Credit
Suisse Group said it was buying DLJ for $11.5 billion, sending DLJ
shares up $4.50 to $88.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in other brokerages rose on anticipation of further
consolidation in the industry, including J.P. Morgan, up $3.75 at
$152.75. Shares of Lehman Brothers rose initially but were down
12.5 cents at $140.38 by midafternoon.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, off $23 at $129.88, was leading some computer shares lower
in profit-taking.

   Helping the Nasdaq, Amazon.com rose $3.38 to $43 following some
bullish comments from a Goldman Sachs analyst.

   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by a narrow margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 555.91 million
shares, up from Tuesday's pace.

<HEADLINE> Laser Knocks Down Two Rockets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE, N.M. (AP) -- An experimental laser
that someday may protect Israel's northern border blew up two
rockets in simultaneous flight during a test in the New Mexico
desert, the U.S. Army said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tactical High Energy Laser, or THEL, blew up a single
artillery rocket in June. Monday's test was closer to conditions
the THEL could face on the battlefield: multiple rockets coming
from different directions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's certainly a milestone for the program,'' said Gerda
Sherrill, a spokeswoman at the Army's Space and Missile Defense
Command at Huntsville, Ala. The command oversees the $200 million
program being developed jointly by Israel and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   An unidentified official familiar with Monday's test told the
Albuquerque Journal that the laser blew up both rockets on its
third try. In each of two tests earlier in the day, the laser shot
down only one rocket.
</P>
<P>
   The laser beam, which has a range of a few miles, heats the
rockets until they explode. The biggest technical challenge for
THEL lies in tracking the incoming rockets.
</P>
<P>
   THEL's targets are Katyushas, Russian-made short-range artillery
rockets. Hezbollah guerrillas launch volleys of the 10-foot rockets
from southern Lebanon into northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   If deployed, THEL could become the first destructive laser
system in the world to see action.

<HEADLINE> Online Cancer Diary Draws Attention  </HEADLINE>
By JOE McDONALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- After painful surgery and doses of
radiation failed to stop the tumor growing in his neck, Lu Youqing
decided he'd suffered enough.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old real-estate developer halted his treatment and
prepared to die. But instead of retreating into privacy to await
death, Lu made his story public by creating a diary on a Shanghai
Web site chronicling his final weeks.
</P>
<P>
   His ''Diary of Death'' has become a minor literary sensation.
Lu's candid account of his failing health, bouts of depression and
sense of loss have attracted thousands of Web surfers a day and
touched off a debate about death.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to awaken the concern and love of society toward
cancer patients,'' Lu said in an interview. ''I think I have the
responsibility to speak out.''
</P>
<P>
   Lu posted his first entry Aug. 3 and said he expected to live no
more than 100 days.
</P>
<P>
   An operation and six radiation treatments had failed to stop the
spread of a malignant tumor on a salivary gland in front of his
right ear. He said he halted treatment in February against his
doctor's advice.
</P>
<P>
   Coming six years after Lu lost 80 percent of his stomach when
surgeons removed a separate cancer, the new treatment left him weak
and emaciated.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt the routine treatment method wasn't helping my illness,
but I still had to suffer terrible physical and spiritual pain, as
well as paying a lot for it,'' Lu said. ''I have the right to
choose the way I want to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Lu begins his day at 6:30 a.m., settling into a sofa in his
bedroom to write on a laptop computer. A 2,000- to 3,000-word entry
takes four to five hours, and he sometimes nods off from fatigue.
He posts a new entry every two to three days.
</P>
<P>
   Lu no longer has the energy to work at the real-estate company
where he is assistant general manager. His wife has quit her
teaching job to care for him. The couple have a 10-year-old
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Lu said he already has lived longer than his doctors predicted.
He gives some of the credit to a new sense of purpose the diary has
given him.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people are surprised at how he managed to live so
long,'' said his wife, Shi Muyan. ''Supported by his strength of
will, we have managed to travel this far. I think every day he
lives is a bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   Lu's way of dying has drawn mixed public reaction in letters to
newspapers and comments on Web sites. Some praise Lu's composure,
while others appeal to him to fight death.
</P>
<P>
   ''A really brave person ... should battle unfair fate and take
responsibility for his family. He should receive 36, even 60,
radiation treatments,'' a reader wrote to the Shanghai Youth Daily
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   In his diary, Lu reminisces about childhood and talks about his
family and love of singing. Though he says the diary is meant to
lift readers' spirits, he also writes frankly about his sorrow at
seeing his life cut short.
</P>
<P>
   ''God gave me less than 40 years of life, probably only half the
time he gives to others. Even if he has shown me the most beautiful
paintings of living, I still have the right to complain that I
don't get enough time to appreciate them,'' says one entry.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his occasional flashes of dark humor, Lu writes that
he wished he died in the Concorde jetliner crash July 25 outside
Paris. Death would be quick, he says, and Air France would pay his
family compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Diary of Death'' appears on the Shanghai-based literary
Web site www.Rongshu.com. It shares the site with more traditional
artistic fare such as poetry, Chinese painting and a series of
photographs by American artist Cindy Sherman.
</P>
<P>
   The diary, which is in Chinese, gets 2,000 to 3,000 readers a
day, said Jin Jun, Lu's editor at Rongshu.com. He said that number
was limited by the site's slow Web access, and could be much higher
without such technical constraints.
</P>
<P>
   Rongshu.com is considering publishing the completed diary as a
book, Jin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a terrific story,'' he said.

   LONDON (AP) -- A food fight at the Oscars of heavy metal music
left actress Britt Ekland hospitalized with a broken wrist and
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Ekland slipped on a piece of melon left over from a raucous
celebration as she went on stage to make a presentation Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being in severe pain, Ekland, 57, let a bouncer carry
her to the stage and presented an award to singer Marilyn Manson.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was very, very kind to her and he did talk to her and look
after her afterwards,'' Ekland's agent, Suzanne Martin, said of
Manson. ''He had a nice sensitive side.''
</P>
<P>
   Ekland was once married to comedian Peter Sellers and dated rock
star Rod Stewart.
</P>

3-9:
<TEXT>
<P>
   80 years ago: D.W. Griffith's movie ''Way Down East'' opened.

films. He had made five.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago: Vanessa Williams canceled a fall singing tour to
appear in ''Eraser,'' an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.
</P>
<P>

<P>
	   SADDLE BROOK, N.J. (AP) - An elderly man was killed Wednesday
when his car slammed into the back of a bus that was taking on
passengers at a Route 46 bus stop.
</P>
<P>
   NJ Transit spokesman Ken Miller said the victim, whose name was
not immediately available, drove into the back of a bus on the No.
161 line between Paterson and New York shortly before noon.
</P>
<P>
   The bus was facing east on Route 46 and had stopped at a bus
stop when the accident occurred, he said. The car also was
traveling east on Route 46.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the 12 passengers aboard the bus, plus the bus driver,
complained of minor neck and back injuries and were taken to a
local hospital for treatment, Miller said.

<HEADLINE> Profit sharing proposed in merger unlikely  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW BRITAIN, Conn. (AP) - If Connecticut Light &AMP; Power makes
bigger profits after the proposed merger with Consolidated Edison,
the company promises in its merger application to share some of the
wealth with shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   But CL&AMP;P's parent company, Northeast Utilities, acknowledges in
paperwork before state regulators that such increased profits are
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   NU chief executive Michael Morris told the Waterbury
Republican-American the profit-sharing proposal may never come into
play. But he said the profit-sharing offer is a risk the utilities
are willing to take to make the merger better for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The plan ''may or may not materialize, but we need to work hard
on that to make sure we deliver as much as we can to our
customers,'' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   To sweeten the deal for regulators, the company also has pledged
to freeze rates until the end of 2005 - two years longer than
mandated by law - and write off $50 million in old debts.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who has been vocal in his
opposition to the merger, claims the profit-sharing proposal and
other offerings for consumers will make little difference.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Public Utility Control is poring over reams of
paperwork on the proposed merger, which would create the largest
electric and gas distribution company in the country. The agency is
scheduled to issue a draft decision on the merger Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Under the profit-sharing proposal, CL&AMP;P would share 40 percent
of the profits it takes in over a certain amount of profits after
the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Under state regulations, CL&AMP;P can only earn up to a 10.3 percent
profit off its net revenues. NU has proposed sharing any profits
above 12.3 percent of net revenues after the merger.
</P>
<P>
   The company has said this profit-sharing proposal was made to
address concerns that CL&AMP;P may see a sudden windfall after the
merger.
</P>
<P>
   But in Aug. 11 filings with the DPUC, company officials say ''it
is unlikely that CL&AMP;P will experience earnings higher than 10.3
percent as projected in its budgets.''
</P>
<P>
   Another benefit the companies have proposed for consumers is a
$50 million reduction in the amount of stranded costs consumers
will have to pay under the state's deregulation law.
</P>
<P>
   Stranded costs include old utility debts from building power
plants under state regulations that would not otherwise get paid
off under deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said the offer is so small as to be insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   ''Think of it as a $100,000 mortgage: If you reduce that by
$5,000, you'd pay it off a few years earlier, but you would
continue to pay it virtually unchanged until that date. The
question is, how many consumers care about reducing the stranded
costs by a few years sometime so far in the future?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said the offer amounts to real savings for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ''When they say it's not really a $50 million guarantee to
customers, it's an artistic way of twisting around something that's
real,'' Morris said. ''That is a real $50 million that consumers
wouldn't be able to save without this merger.''

<HEADLINE> A cautionary state report about dormitory fire safety  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Within a report on fire safety at college
dormitories in New York are some findings that you don't need a
baccalaureate degree to recognize as troubling.
</P>
<P>
   FACT: There are more than 1,000 buildings used as residences at
public and private colleges in New York which do not have either a
complete smoke detection-alarm system or a full sprinkler system.
</P>
<P>
   FACT: Only 15 percent of the college dormitories in New York
have full sprinkler systems.
</P>
<P>
   FACT: Campuses reported an average of more than 300 fires in New
York college dormitories per year over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   The task force which compiled these numbers was appointed by
Gov. George Pataki in response to a dorm fire in another state. In
January, three students at Seton Hall University in New Jersey died
and 58 others were injured in a blaze.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey responded to the tragedy in July when Gov. Christie
Whitman signed into law a bill requiring all colleges in that state
to install dormitory sprinkler systems within four years. The
legislation made a $93 million loan pool available to help colleges
pay for the fire safety improvements.
</P>
<P>
   As the New York task force pointed out, New Jersey's program
will provide water sprinklers for 9.5 million square feet of
college dorm space. The task force figured that New York's private
and public colleges have about 37 million square feet of
unsprinklered dormitory footage, all of it built before tougher
building codes went into effect in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The task force did not recommend that the state adopt a
hard-and-fast deadline like New Jersey's on the ''retrofitting'' of
existing dorm buildings with sprinklers. But it did say that,
eventually, the safest course will be to outfit all residence
buildings with sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will this process be expensive - the task force never
does venture a cost estimate - but it will also be disruptive to
the campuses where the work is being carried out, the panel
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the task force recommended taking a range of
measures to enhance fire safety, such as stepping up fire
inspections of dorms, better educating students about fire dangers
and more severely punishing students who disable fire alarms or set
off false alarms.
</P>
<P>
   But the state would only be marking time with steps short of
mandating proper fire alarm and sprinklers, said the chairman of
the state Assembly's higher education committee, Manhattan Democrat
Edward Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eventually, and I think as soon as possible, we are going to
have to have all dormitories sprinklered,'' Sullivan said. ''There
is no point fiddling with it.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey is not alone in moving toward getting sprinklers in
more dormitory buildings.
</P>
<P>
   In Kentucky, sprinklers and more advanced fire-alarm systems
were installed in public universities as part of a statewide effort
to make the dorms safer following a 1998 fire at Murray State
University which killed one student.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, officials said dozens of dormitories on state
university campuses still lack sprinkler systems despite a 1996
fraternity house fire that killed five students at the University
of North Carolina's Chapel Hill campus.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts and Pennsylvania officials each announced plans
this year to install sprinklers in dormitories on public college
campuses.
</P>
<P>
   But in New York, the discussion about mandated sprinklers barely
got going in 2000. Pataki has promised to build a legislative dorm
fire safety agenda in 2001 around the task force's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the proposals will attract little or no opposition. But
when hundreds of millions of dollars are involved - as they would
be with a sprinkler mandate - fierce political battling can be
expected.
</P>
<P>
   If taxpayers pick up the tab for sprinklers throughout the State
University of New York system, the question will undoubtedly arise
whether it is then fair to make private colleges or the students
who attend them pay for the same improvements. Democrats in the
Assembly seem to be receptive to providing special state aid to the
state's private colleges to make the sprinkler upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   And Sullivan said the situation could get even more complicated
and expensive should the state extend the sprinkler requirements to
the off-campus housing so many college students call home during
their academic careers.

<HEADLINE> Clinton and Lazio roll out big guns in New York Senate race  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Senate candidates Hillary Rodham Clinton and
Rep. Rick Lazio rolled out the big guns Wednesday, with the first
lady releasing a fund-raising letter from President Clinton and the
congressman running a TV ad starring John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have worked as hard as I could to turn our country around,''
the president writes in the appeal. ''Now, the work must be carried
on by others. No one is more qualified than Hillary to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new Lazio ad, McCain casts doubt on Clinton's claim that
she is willing to give up unlimited soft-money campaign
contributions if her Republican opponent does the same.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's pretty clear there's only one Senate candidate who really
wants campaign finance reform - Rick Lazio,'' the Arizona senator
says.
</P>
<P>
   The president's letter ''about the Senate candidate I know
best'' warns that his wife's opponents ''will spare no expense and
respect no boundaries in their efforts to defeat her.''
</P>
<P>
   The president says he is making the appeal ''not just out of
personal interest, but also in the hope of advancing the values and
highest ideals of our party and our nation.''

<HEADLINE> Bomb Found Before Clinton's Visit  </HEADLINE>
By JAVIER BAENA
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) -- Colombian police said they found a
small bomb in a Cartagena neighborhood hours before President
Clinton was to appear there Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A Secret Service official said that only explosive materials --
not a bomb -- had been found. But Carlos Perdomo, spokesman for the
National Police, said a 4.4 pound explosive device had been
deactivated.
</P>
<P>
   Perdomo said the device was apparently not designed to cause
damage or injuries, but to spread propaganda of the leftist rebels
of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   He said two rebels were seen planting it and were arrested by
police. They had in their possession dozens of pamphlets denouncing
Clinton's one-day visit to Colombia on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's purpose was to scatter FARC propaganda against the visit
of President Clinton,'' Perdomo said.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrillas frequently plant pamphlets when they set off bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service official said three people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Perdomo said the device was placed five blocks from the House of
Justice, a neighborhood government building which Clinton and
Colombian President Andres Pastrana were to inaugurate later
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides traveling with Clinton said they had no
immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel group, known as the FARC, is the largest and oldest
guerrilla movement in Colombia.

<HEADLINE> Putin Dismisses Bolshoi Director  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID McHUGH
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin has shaken up the
leadership of the troubled Bolshoi Theater, dismissing its director
and asserting tighter government control over one of Russia's most
renowned cultural institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's order, published Wednesday, puts the 224-year-old ballet
and opera theater under direct control of the Ministry of Culture
as it struggles to finish a long-delayed renovation of its landmark
building in central Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ''As minister, I have the task of putting in order the work of
the Bolshoi Theater and the financing of the reconstruction,''
Culture Minister Mikhail Shvydkoi was quoted as saying by the
Kommersant newspaper Wednesday. ''How can I answer for financial
flows if they don't go through my hands?''
</P>
<P>
   Though it is a state institution, the Bolshoi had a substantial
degree of autonomy after the collapse of the Soviet Union. It was
not under the control of any ministry and reported directly to the
Russian president.
</P>
<P>
   But the theater fell on hard times. Government funding dried up,
an autocratic director was dismissed in 1995 after the ballet
company's dancers rebelled and foreign tours brought poor or mixed
reviews. Critics flayed Bolshoi head Vladimir Vasiliev for his
production of the classic ballet ''Swan Lake,'' in which he changed
the story by eliminating the part of Odile, the Black Swan.
</P>
<P>
   The Bolshoi recently appeared to be recovering from its
troubles, receiving good reviews from a U.S. tour this summer and
winning several prizes in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Vasiliev's job of artistic and general director was eliminated
by the order, which was signed Monday. It didn't specifically say
he was fired, but news reports said Vasiliev was out and Shvydkoi
was quoted as saying he had chosen Anatoly Iksanov, former head of
St. Petersburg's Bolshoi Drama Theater, as the new executive
director.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper quoted Gennady
Rozhdestvensky, a world-famous orchestral conductor who formerly
worked at the Bolshoi, as saying he was in negotiations for the job
of artistic director.
</P>
<P>
   Shvydkoi said the changes were made to streamline the stalled
effort to renovate the Bolshoi building. The work can't proceed
until the government comes up with the money to finish a second
structure next door, which is to provide a place for performances
while the original building is closed for renovation.
</P>
<P>
   The theater, built in 1825, had its interior reconstructed after
an 1856 fire. Backstage areas are cramped and dark. The electrical
wiring, some of which hangs in bundles tacked on the walls, has not
been replaced since the 1940s -- an invitation to another disaster
like the fire that shut down Moscow's television tower Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Many saw the shakeup as a move by Shvydkoi to expand his
ministry's authority. It also was seen as a general tightening of
control by Putin's government over institutions that went their own
way under former president Boris Yeltsin, who resigned Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ''It reflects a general trend of the government establishing
more central control over every sphere, including culture,'' said
Yevgeny Volk, a political analyst with the Heritage Foundation in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office, Putin has won legal curbs on the powers of
Russia's regions and established stronger Kremlin control over the
parliament, which is dominated by a pro-Putin party.
</P>
<P>
   In the cultural sphere, Shvydkoi recently expanded his authority
by taking control of Goskino, the state filmmaking company. He
fired leading conductor Yevgeny Svetlanov from a government
orchestra for spending too much time conducting overseas.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 96; Nasdaq Gains 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Shares of brokerage companies surged Wednesday
following news that Credit Suisse had agreed to buy Donaldson,
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, but the overall market was mixed in lackluster
trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was off 95.82 at 11,119.28 in
late afternoon trading. The Nasdaq composite index was up 4.15 at
4,086.32, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 7.09 at
1,502.75.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in market where a lot of people are already leaving for
the long weekend,'' said Al Goldman, chief investment strategist at
A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis. ''Business is thin and nobody
wants to take a big stance. There's just a lot of boredom on the
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Brokerages and financial services stocks gained after Credit
Suisse Group said it was buying DLJ for $11.5 billion, sending DLJ
shares up $4.56 to $88.56 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in other financial companies rose on anticipation of
further consolidation in the brokerage industry, including J.P.
Morgan, up $3.94 at $152.94. Shares of Lehman Brothers rose
initially but were down 6.2 cents at $140.44 by 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, off $2.75 at $130.13, was leading some computer shares
lower in profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
   Helping the Nasdaq, Amazon.com rose $3.31to $42.94 following
some bullish comments from a Goldman Sachs analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by a narrow margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 555.91 million

<HEADLINE> Japan Concerned Over Food Safety  </HEADLINE>
By MARI YAMAGUCHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The initial shock was bad enough. Not only had
Japan's biggest dairy company sickened nearly 15,000 people with
contaminated milk, it had routinely -- though secretly -- recycled
old milk to make other products.
</P>
<P>
   But what has followed is enough to ruin anyone's appetite: dead
lizards in potato chips, worms in pastries, flies in canned juice.
Barraged for week with such daily horror stories, many Japanese are
wondering if it's safe to eat or drink anything anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every day we hear about some new problem, and it's shocking,''
said Tokyo housewife Toshie Ojima. ''But these things were probably
happening all along and we just didn't know about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns over food safety have grown so strong they are now
being debated on the parliament floor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many of the incidents are the result of sloppiness and
complacency,'' Deputy Health Minister Yutaka Fukushima said at a
recent parliamentary meeting. ''Manufacturers should return to the
very basic and think again about food safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Food makers aren't the only problem. The media has been
dominated recently by reports that another big brand name --
Mitsubishi Motors -- hid consumer complaints for years instead of
examining whether their vehicles had potential dangers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is enough to really make one wonder,'' said a front-page
editorial in the Asahi, one of Japan's largest newspapers.
''Consumer trust in corporate sincerity is growing shakier.''
</P>
<P>
   The food scare began in late June, when some 14,800 people were
sickened by staph bacteria in lowfat milk produced by Snow Brand
Milk Products Co.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation revealed the company routinely recycled milk
returned from stores, including some with expired freshness dates,
for use in cheese and other products.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the discovery of any foreign object in food or drink
has been enough to prompt huge recalls.
</P>
<P>
   So far this month, at least 18 cases of food contamination led
to recalls, according to the state-funded Japan Food Hygiene
Association. These included by Kikkoman Corp.'s recall of 25,300
cans of Del Monte-brand tomato sauce and 36,000 jars of pasta sauce
after broken glass was found in one. Yakult Honsha Co. had to
recall 446,800 cans of fruit juice after one was found to contain a
shard of plastic.
</P>
<P>
   Such stories are taking their psychological toll.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey published by the nation's largest newspaper, the
Yomiuri, showed more than half of 1,983 respondents are afraid they
or their family members may suffer food poisoning before the summer
is out.
</P>
<P>
   Some 45 percent indicated they don't trust manufacturers'
hygiene standards and nearly 54 percent said they believe even
drinking tap water is unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kazuya Fujiwara, spokesman for Japanese Consumers'
Cooperative Union, one of Japan's largest food distributors, said
food contamination is not on the rise. It is merely getting more
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Snow Brand case only triggered the existing problem of
food contamination to become a social issue,'' he said. ''It is a
reminder to consumers of the abundant dangers of what they eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Just four years ago, for example, food contaminated with E. coli
bacteria claimed 12 lives and sickened more than 10,000 people in
Japan. Most of the victims were children and the elderly, who have
less resistance to bacterial infections.
</P>
<P>
   Fujiwara said the problem cannot be solved unless the government
adopts stricter legal protections for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   And many analysts familiar with Japan's corporate system see the
recent food contamination cases -- and the Mitsubishi Motors scandal
-- as the inevitable result of lax concern for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Very basic principles of manufacturing are falling apart at
many companies in various industries,'' Keio University business
professor Keinosuke Ono wrote in the recent issue of the Weekly
Toyo Keizai magazine, a respected economic journal.
</P>
<P>
   ''These cases remind us of the considerable lack of
responsibility and commitment among corporations,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   A slew of high-profile incidents involving food and drink
contamination are creating an uproar in Japan. Here are some recent
examples:
------
</P>
<P>
   -- BAD MILK: Lowfat milk produced by Snow Brand Milk Products
Co., Japan's largest dairy products maker, sickened nearly 14,800
people in western Japan because of staph germ contamination. The
company shut down operations at 20 factories nationwide from late
June to early August for government inspection. But despite a
recent go-ahead, this week it was forced to issue another recall,
for powdered skim milk.
------
</P>
<P>
   -- LIZARD CHIPS: Japan's top snack food maker, Calbee, was forced
to temporarily close one of its plants this month after a dead
lizard was found inside a bag of garlic butter-flavored potato
chips. Company president Masahiko Matsuo apologized and recalled
62,000 bags distributed in Tokyo and several nearby cities.
------
</P>
<P>
   -- BUG IN A BUN: Yamazaki Baking Co., the nation's top baked-
goods producer, recalled 700,000 cups of pudding in July after
consumers complained of a sour taste and smell caused by excessive
levels of lactic-acid bacteria and yeast. Yamazaki also recalled
17,000 moldy potato curry sandwiches. And Yamazaki was back in the
headlines this week, when a quarter-inch-long bug was found in one
of its custard cream buns.
------
</P>
<P>
   -- SMELLY CHEESE: Hokkaido Hidaka Nyugyo voluntarily recalled
280,000 packs of mozzarella cheese from supermarkets nationwide
after consumers complained of foul odor caused by excessive
fermentation triggered by hot weather. No toxins or germs were
found.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Theft Suspect Assaulted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUIS TRICHARDT, South Africa (AP) -- A 14-year-old girl
suspected of shoplifting underwear was painted white by a security
guard, police said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, who is black, had picked some underwear and brought it
to the shop's counter Tuesday afternoon when the clerk accused her
of trying to steal the goods, worth about 40 cents, police said.
The clerk, who is black, called the store's white manager, who in
turn called the black security guard.
</P>
<P>
   The three brought the girl to a back room, where the manager
ordered the security guard to paint the girl with white paint,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her blouse was taken off and her stomach, chest, back, neck,
arms and head were painted white,'' Northern Province police
spokesman Phuti Setati told the South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
   The three store employees -- manager Thelma Strydom, clerk Julia
Munyai and security guard Albert Mbedzi -- then allegedly took $18
from the girl before she was allowed to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Police refused to describe the incident as racist. All three
store employees were charged with theft. Strydom also was charged
with assault, while Mbedzi faces indecent assault charges.
</P>
<P>
   The managing director of Pep Stores, the franchise to which the
store belongs, offered an apology Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If these allegations are proved to be true, we want to
apologize sincerely to the girl and her parents for what has
happened, whatever the provocation,'' Andri Labuschaigne said.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Trichardt is located 250 miles northeast of Johannesburg.

<HEADLINE> Head of CNN domestic operations to leave  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - With ratings dwindling and competitors chipping
away at its dominant news role, CNN announced a restructuring
Wednesday that included the ouster of the head of its U.S. network,
Rick Kaplan, after three years.
</P>
<P>
   CNN said it plans to more aggressively integrate its television
and Internet operations. Its parent company, Time Warner, is about
to complete its merger with America Online.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether Kaplan's job, president of CNN/USA, will
be filled. In the restructuring, his duties were dispersed among
other executives.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Kent, formerly president of Turner Broadcasting System
International, was appointed president and chief operating officer
of the CNN News Group. Eason Jordan, who has controlled CNN's
international news operation, will become CNN's chief news
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan was offered other opportunities within Time Warner but
chose not to take them, said Terence McGuirk, who oversees CNN for
Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe it best that I now move on,'' Kaplan said in a
statement. ''I have had a wonderful experience over the past three
years. I thank the fine group of journalists that I have been
privileged to work with. ... I believe that we have enhanced the
quality of news coverage and improved the depth of reporting.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan, a colorful 34-time Emmy winner during his long career as
producer for ABC News, joined CNN as president of its USA
operations in August 1997. He was given the mission of boosting the
network's viewership when it didn't have breaking news to depend
upon.
</P>
<P>
   Those efforts, particularly a nightly newsmagazine called
''Newsstand,'' largely failed. Fox News Channel and MSNBC siphoned
off viewers and, during good economic times, so did the financial
network CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   CNN has also been hurt by a growing number of local 24-hour
cable news networks and the reliance by more consumers on the
Internet for news updates, said Tom Johnson, chairman of the CNN
News Group.
</P>
<P>
   CNN's average daily viewership sank from 463,000 people during
the third quarter of 1997, when Kaplan started, to 288,000 during
the second three months of this year, according to Nielsen Media
Research. The prime-time dropoff was even steeper, at 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The network's second-quarter ratings were the lowest since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the things that CNN has suffered from is the lack of
long-running breaking news stories,'' said Tom Wolzien, a media
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co. ''We had a huge number of
these stories in the early 1990s when they were growing.''
</P>
<P>
   McGuirk praised Kaplan in an internal memo for ''making us
smarter, faster and more committed than ever to producing the best
news coverage in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing here that's going on that has to do with
ratings, really,'' he said in an interview. ''We have got a major
merger with AOL coming up. We have a news business that is making
the transition toward a digital future that is slightly different
from its analog present.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan, whose friendship with President Clinton made
conservative activists suspicious, is a strong-willed personality
who feuded with one of his best-known anchors, Lou Dobbs, before
Dobbs left for an Internet venture.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan survived a major scandal less than a year into his
tenure, when the network had to retract a story that claimed the
U.S. military used nerve gas on defectors during the Vietnam War.
Two producers were fired as a result of the May 1998 report, and
correspondent Peter Arnett left CNN within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Walton, who has been president of the CNN/Sports Illustrated
sports news network, will be responsible for CNN's domestic news
networks and Web sites.

<HEADLINE> Study: Gas Tax Loophole Saves Cos.  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A loophole exempting light-duty trucks such as
sport utility vehicles from a federal tax on gas guzzlers enabled
automakers to avoid up to $10.2 billion in taxes last year even as
production rises of more polluting, inefficient vehicles, according
to an environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1978 law passed by Congress to encourage production of
fuel-efficient vehicles, U.S. and foreign auto manufacturers must
pay taxes ranging from $1,000 to $7,700 for each new passenger car
that gets below 22.5 miles per gallon on a combined city-highway
average.
</P>
<P>
   Light-duty trucks, which include pickups, minivans, full-size
vans and SUVs, were exempted on the theory that many were used in
businesses such as construction and on farms. At the time, these
vehicles made up about a quarter of new vehicle sales.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, light-duty trucks are almost half of all new
sales, and are frequently used more for commuting and other daily
chores as well. The study released Wednesday by the
Washington-based nonprofit group, Friends of the Earth, concluded
that if these vehicles were held to the same 22.5 mpg standard, the
industry as a whole would have paid the federal government $10.2
billion alone in additional gas guzzler taxes in 1999 -- and $43.1
billion over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Automakers are avoiding paying taxes and cranking out
polluting and gas-guzzling vehicles,'' said Brian Dunkiel, director
of tax programs at Friends of the Earth. ''It's not fair, it's bad
for the environment, and it's making America more dependent on
foreign oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Taxes that could have applied to SUVs alone in 1999 amounted to
$5.6 billion, the study found. Pickup trucks avoided $3.9 billion
and vans and minivans, which tend to be more fuel efficient, $811
million.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Internal Revenue Service collected only $48
million in gas guzzler taxes on passenger cars in 1998 -- the most
recent year complete data was available -- mainly on luxury sedans
and high-end sports cars.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. auto industry has acknowledged room for improvement in
the fuel efficiency of SUVs. Ford Motor Co. recently announced it
will increase the fuel economy of its SUV fleet by 25 percent, from
18 mpg to 23 mpg, by 2005. General Motors Corp. says it will offer
pickups and buses that burn up to 50 percent less fuel and
DaimlerChrysler AG has a gas/electric version of its Dodge Durango
SUV ready for market if it can be priced competitively.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Bergquist, spokeswoman for the Alliance of Auto
Manufacturers representing 13 major U.S. and foreign auto
companies, said extending the gas guzzler tax to light-duty trucks
would inevitably raise costs for consumers while not hastening the
availability of more fuel-efficient, less polluting vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Automakers are already competing with each other to bring more
fuel-efficient vehicles to market,'' she said. ''Our view is that
competition is going to drive more progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials also said that the Friends of the Earth
report produced inflated estimates of the potential tax avoided
through the loophole, noting that the federal fuel efficiency
standard for a company's entire light truck fleet is 20.7 mpg,
compared with 27.5 mpg for cars.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists said even if light-duty trucks were given
a similar fuel-efficiency discount for tax purposes, the loophole
would still permit them to avoid billions of dollars in taxes every
year. They said the loophole acts as a subsidy for larger vehicles
that burn more gas and cause more pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe we should close the tax loophole that gives the
worst vehicles an advantage,'' said Ralph Nader, the longtime
consumer advocate who is running for president on the Green Party
ticket.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Leaders Mull Divine Rule  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israelis and Palestinians who have spent months
wrangling over which side should control Jerusalem's holy sites are
turning their attention to an idea first floated at Camp David: put
God in charge.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal to declare God the sovereign over Jerusalem shrines
that are holy to both Muslims and Jews is still tentative, but it
has the potential to help defuse the most emotional dispute in the
Mideast peace talks. It has won the guarded endorsement of
Jerusalem's hawkish Israeli mayor and a top Palestinian official --
marking the first time the two sides have found any common ground
on how to share the city.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was first proposed when July's Mideast summit at Camp
David broke down because both Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat insisted they could never give up
control over holy shrines, political scientist Menachem Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very promising solution,'' said Klein, a member of
an Israeli think tank that has been advising Barak in negotiations
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal comes as Israel and the Palestinians are working on
a final peace treaty resolving all the remaining issues between
them. Those issues include the future of Palestinian refugees who
want to return to land in Israel and the fate of Jewish settlements
in heavily Palestinian territories like the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But the toughest issue is the future of Jerusalem, and the
stickiest of the sticking points is the dispute over Temple Mount,
known to Muslims as Haram as-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-acre walled, raised platform in the heart of Jerusalem's
Old City is Islam's third holiest shrine and home to two major
mosques, al-Aqsa and Dome of the Rock. The mosques are built on the
site of the ancient Jewish Temples. One of the remnants of the
Second Temple, the Western Wall, runs alongside the mosque compound
and is the most revered site of Judaism today.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat demands full Palestinian sovereignty over all of
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, including the Old City and its
holy places. He has said the mosques are sacred to millions of
Muslims around the world and that he does not have a mandate to
surrender them to the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has made the same argument, saying no Israeli prime
minister could ever give up the Temple Mount, the object of Jewish
longing through the ages.
</P>
<P>
   If God is declared sovereign, both leaders might be able to save
face and no longer have to fear being branded a traitor to their
religion. Klein said negotiators could then start working out the
details of how sovereignty is expressed, such as who would be in
charge of security and who would issue permits for renovations.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, the division of powers between the Arafat-appointed
Muslim clerics and the Israeli government is complex. For example,
Muslim leaders have carried out extensive renovations in the mosque
compound despite Israel's strenuous objections. On the other hand,
mosque guards partner with Israeli police in escorting devout
Jewish visitors to make sure they don't violate a ban on Jewish
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiator Ahmed Qureia on Monday dismissed the idea
of transferring sovereignty to God and said it was never formally
raised in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we want from the Israelis is acceptance of Palestinian
sovereignty over east Jerusalem. When they do, we will be ready to
negotiate several issues of interest to them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Klein said divine sovereignty was one of several
creative solutions, and perhaps even the main one, considered by
Egyptian and U.S. mediators who also brought it up with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   And on Wednesday, the idea won unexpected -- if guarded -- backing
from Jerusalem's hawkish mayor, Ehud Olmert, who has opposed giving
the Palestinians a role in running the city and is a leading figure
in the main opposition party, Likud.
</P>
<P>
   ''Divine sovereignty is something that can be pursued,'' Olmert
told a news conference. His caveat: Future arrangements must be
based on the current situation, in which Israel has overall control
over security and Muslim clerics run the day-to-day affairs inside
the mosque compound.
</P>
<P>
   Ziad Abu Zayyad, the Palestinian Cabinet minister in charge of
Jerusalem issues, also said the idea had merit on two conditions:
that Palestinians be put in charge of security in the compound and
that the Islamic Trust, which administers the two mosques, become
part of a future Palestinian government.
</P>
<P>
   ''If de facto we will be the landlord there, why argue about the
issue of sovereignty?'' Abu Zayyad said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   KINGSTON, N.Y. (AP) - A Long Island man pleaded guilty to
first-degree murder and arson Wednesday, admitting that he killed
his parents and burned down their vacation home.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Roberts, 23, entered his plea in Ulster County Court.
District Attorney Donald Williams Jr. said he accepted the plea
because it was the top count in the indictment. Williams said he
did not make any sentencing agreement in accepting the plea.
</P>
<P>
   The charred bodies of Seth and Ronna Roberts, who were
immigration attorneys from Great Neck, Long Island, were found in
the rubble of their Woodstock vacation home after it was torched
last Nov. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Their son, a former Syracuse University student, was accused of
killing the couple and setting their home ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Fidler, Roberts's uncle, said Seth and Ronna Roberts took
their son to their Woodstock home to kick a heroin addiction cold
turkey. Fidler said Roberts snapped and killed his parents two days
after arriving in Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   Sentencing was set for Oct. 6. Roberts could receive a prison
term of up to 25 years to life.

<HEADLINE> Death Concerns War Crimes Tribunal  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Prosecutors at the Yugoslav
tribunal voiced concern Wednesday that the apparent murder of a
potential witness would have a chilling effect on people
considering testifying against war criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Milan Levar, a former Croat soldier who provided evidence on
comrades suspected of murdering Serbs, was killed Monday in an
explosion outside his home in Gospic, Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will no doubt have an impact on other witnesses,'' said
Deputy Prosecutor Graham Blewitt. He said the U.N. tribunal ''will
continue to do everything possible to provide adequate protection
for all of our witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Blewitt confirmed that Levar was interviewed ''during 1997 and
1998 in relation to investigations being conducted by the
tribunal,'' formally known as the International Criminal Tribunal
for the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   No indictment has so far been served as a result of Levar's
evidence, the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   But he noted the Croat had rejected the tribunal's offer of
protection, choosing instead to give details of his allegations to
Croatian media.
</P>
<P>
   ''He obviously took the view a couple of years ago that his best
protection was by going public,'' the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   Levar claimed that military leaders Tihomir Oreskovic and Mirko
Norac were responsible for a murderous campaign against Croatia's
Serbian minority, and some Croats, during Croatia's war of
independence against Serb-dominated Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Levar's allegations shocked many Croats, who generally view
themselves as victims of Serb aggression.
</P>
<P>
   A Croatian investigative judge told state-run television on
Tuesday that ''Levar died a violent death.'' And a leading Croatian
human rights organization criticized both the tribunal and the
Zagreb government for failing to provide Levar with proper
protection.
</P>
<P>
   Blewitt also said Wednesday that chief war crimes prosecutor
Carla Del Ponte will tour countries surrounding Bosnia and Serbia
this fall in an attempt to tighten the screws on indicted suspects.
</P>
<P>
   He said the campaign is partly aimed at turning up the heat on
the U.N. tribunal's most-wanted men -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's being done to reinforce in President Milosevic's mind and
in Karadic's -- in fact in the minds of all fugitives -- that they
really are prisoners within their own borders,'' Blewitt told a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   As part of her campaign, Del Ponte will visit Bulgaria and
Romania in September, and Greece and Cyprus later this year,
Blewitt said. She recently visited Macedonia, Slovenia, Hungary and
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Blewitt said several countries have already agreed to implement
measures to help capture suspects wanted by the tribunal. He
declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has been indicted for war crimes against Kosovar
Albanians which provoked NATO's 78-day air campaign against Serbia
last year. Karadzic and his military chief Ratko Mladic are wanted
for genocide in the 1992-95 Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   Even if NATO peacekeepers stationed in the Balkans fail to
arrest the Serb leaders, prosecutors want their international
isolation to continue.

<HEADLINE> Spraying scheduled for Nassau, lower Manhattan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A 52-year-old Staten Island man has tested
positive for the West Nile virus, the sixth human case of the
potentially deadly disease this year, city officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The man, who was not identified, is at home recovering, said
city health commissioner Neal Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the other people infected with West Nile have recovered,
while an 87-year-old Brooklyn woman remains hospitalized in
critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, state agriculture commissioner Nathan Rudgers
said that a horse on Staten Island had been euthanized Aug. 20
after it contracted the virus, and the city announced that two more
birds in Queens had also tested positive.
</P>
<P>
   Pesticide spraying is scheduled for the next three nights in
portions of Manhattan, Queens and Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   Nassau County also ordered its first mosquito spraying of the
year for Bethpage, Farmingdale, Massapequa and Massapequa Park,
using the pesticide Scourge. County health officials said infected
mosquitoes were found in two pools of water in Bethpage State Park
and north of the Sunrise Mall in Massapequa. Spraying will take
place Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials had earlier called spraying unnecessary because no
Nassau county mosquitoes had tested positive for the virus. Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani criticized the decision, saying failure to act
could be harmful to public health.
</P>
<P>
   Seven people in the metro area, including one from Nassau
County, died from virus-related symptoms in 1999 and scores more
were hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a Long Island environmental group said an unusual
die-off of a large number of blue claw crabs may be tied to last
year's spraying program in Great South Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Smith, a spokesman for Fish Unlimited, said area fishermen
have been taking a count of the crabs and collecting samples for
testing by an independent laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   He says an unusual die-off of lobsters occurred in Long Island
Sound a year after pesticide spraying in north shore areas.
</P>
<P>
   Suffolk County has been spraying the pesticides Resmethrin and
Sumethrin, both deadly to marine life, Smith said.

<HEADLINE> Three Neo-Nazis Convicted of Murder  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLE, Germany (AP) -- A German court convicted three neo-Nazis
of beating an African immigrant to death and handed down tough
prison sentences Wednesday in an attempt to signal that a ''long
chain of attacks'' on foreigners here must stop.
</P>
<P>
   The state court sentenced Enrico Hilprecht, 24, to the maximum
of life in prison. His two 16-year-old co-defendants, Christian
Richter and Frank Miethbauer, were each given sentences of nine
years -- one year less than the maximum allowed for juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder called the decision ''a
suitable verdict for a heinous crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The case offered a glimpse into Germany's violent skinhead
scene: Fueled by beer and illegal racist rock music, it directs
rage at foreigners and often revolves around the decaying
communist-era housing developments that dot the country's east.
</P>
<P>
   It was in a park in the eastern city of Dessau that the three
men brutally beat and kicked 39-year-old Alberto Adriano in the
head on June 11. Adriano died three days later, leaving behind a
wife and three children.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the verdict Wednesday, Judge Albrecht Hennig said the
court concluded that the three defendants killed Adriano solely
because of his skin color. He said none of the three cared whether
Adriano would survive the beating.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the latest in the long chain of attacks to which we
must put an end,'' Hennig said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Animals show mercy to opponents lying on the ground, but
rightist extremists apparently do not,'' he said. ''They are
pitiless, without mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   The defendants looked stone-faced as the verdict and sentences
were read. Richter, who had grinned at one point during the reading
of the indictment last week, briefly blinked away tears. Defense
lawyers said they were considering whether to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, conceding Germans hadn't paid enough attention to the
growing problem of right-wing violence, planned a visit Thursday to
a makeshift memorial marking the spot where the Mozambican man was
attacked.
</P>
<P>
   The previously unscheduled stop on Schroeder's two-week tour of
eastern Germany is an attempt to demonstrate a renewed government
commitment to fighting resurgent neo-Nazi attacks that have left at
least three dead this year -- triggering a broad political debate.
</P>
<P>
   According to government statistics, 129 xenophobic offenses were
registered in June, 29 more than in the same month last year. That
included 28 violent right-wing attacks that left one person dead
and 26 injured.
</P>
<P>
   In a ZDF television interview Wednesday, Schroeder said Germany
had ''too often simply ignored problems in this area, or dealt with
them only sporadically.''
</P>
<P>
   He reiterated his call for toughness by police and the courts,
better job and training prospects for ''young hangers-on'' to pull
them out of the neo-Nazi scene and courage by citizens to stand up
against extremism.
</P>
<P>
   Adriano's widow, Angelika, was not in court Wednesday for the
verdict. She decided to stay away after receiving death threats,
said Razak Minhel, a liaison with the foreigner community in
Dessau, where she lives with the couple's three children.
</P>
<P>
   Albino Lemos, a diplomat from the Mozambican Embassy in Berlin
who attended the sentencing, said the German government had woken
up slowly to the racism problem. He welcomed the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will put a bit of fear into those young people,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hennig noted that around the country, neo-Nazi attacks were
being reported nearly daily over the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In the northern town of Luebeck, two neo-Nazis suspected of
kicking and beating a 33-year-old African man appeared in court
Wednesday -- and offered to pay the man $1,400. They face charges of
causing bodily harm, racial incitement and slurs, but prosecutors
said a judge released them without bail after they expressed
remorse and offered damages. Prosecutors were reviewing the
decision to see if they would accept it.
</P>
<P>
   And in another western city, police arrested two suspects
Wednesday in an arson attack on a home for asylum-seekers in
Stuttgart.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran Nazi hunter said Germany can do more to fight the
revival of Adolf Hitler's master-race ideals among youths, a
phenomenon not limited to the formerly communist east.
</P>
<P>
   Willi Dressen, who retires Thursday as head of a special German
prosecutor's office that has tracked Nazi war criminals since 1958,
said the German legal system has been too lenient with Nazi war
crimes suspects -- just as it has been with neo-Nazis. He urged
courts to consistently impose harsh sentences on right-wing
extremists.
</P>
<P>
   ''They must be taken from the streets, that's most important,''
Dressen told The Associated Press by telephone from Ludwigsburg,
the southwestern city where his office is based.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 112; Nasdaq Gains 32  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Shares of brokerage companies surged Wednesday
following news that Credit Suisse had agreed to buy Donaldson,
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, but the overall market was mixed in lackluster
trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 112.09 at
11,103.01, according to preliminary figures.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index was up
32.36 at 4,114.53, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down
4.75 at 1,505.09.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in a market where a lot of people are already leaving
for the long weekend,'' said Al Goldman, chief investment
strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis. ''Business is thin
and nobody wants to take a big stance. There's just a lot of
boredom on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Trading volume has been at its lowest level of the year for more
than a week now, with many traders taking vacations ahead of the
long Labor Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerages and financial services stocks gained after Credit
Suisse Group said it was buying DLJ for $11.5 billion, sending DLJ
shares up $6.13 to $88.38 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in other financial companies rose on anticipation of
further consolidation in the brokerage industry, including J.P.
Morgan, up $2.06 at $151.06.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, off $2.88 at $130, was leading some computer shares lower
in profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
   And retail stocks continued to get hammered on fears of reduced
consumer spending in the second half of the year. Wal Mart Stores
fell $1.75 at $48.188.
</P>
<P>
   Helping the Nasdaq, Amazon.com rose $3.31 to $42.94 following
some bullish comments from a Goldman Sachs analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by a narrow margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 813.27 million
shares, up from Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 1.94 at 531.57.

<HEADLINE> Parents upset about sex offender housing in school neighborhood  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) - Parents and city leaders are upset that
the state is housing two convicted sex offenders in the
neighborhood of a Roman Catholic elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services said
Wednesday it is reviewing the housing arrangements for the two men
following complaints about their proximity to St. Joseph's School.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to make sure the interests of both the clients and
community are met,'' said agency spokesman Dr. Wayne Dailey.
</P>
<P>
   The men, Cale R. Campbell, 19, and Christopher A. Czyzewski, 20,
wear electronic monitors on their ankles and have 24-hour
supervision, but some parents believe they pose a threat to
students and the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's too close to home,'' said Cindy Terry, whose two
children attend St. Joseph School. ''It's definitely too close to
the school.''
</P>
<P>
   Some city leaders also say they will fight to move the men away
from the school.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an absolutely a horrendous place to put such a
facility,'' City Councilor Reid Burdick said.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are in compliance with the terms of their probation and
with Megan's Law, which requires convicted sex offenders to
register their whereabouts with state police, said Ginny Apple, a
spokeswoman for the state Judicial Branch.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell was convicted in March 1999 of third-degree sexual
assault and risk of injury to a minor. His probation expires in
March 2009.
</P>
<P>
   Czyzewski was convicted in September 1998 of indecent assault
and battery. His probation expires in August 2001.
</P>
<P>
   They are in the Young Adult Services program, which helps
clients over age 18 make the transition between the Department of
Children and Families and the Department of Mental Health and
Addiction Services.
</P>
<P>
   The state probation office reviews housing for the people it
monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Coyne, the chief probation officer for New London, would
not comment on the cases because of confidentiality rules. But he
said his office carefully reviews housing options and an offender's
history.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not all sex offenders are the same. We will assess each
offender and see how they accessed their victims and their history,
and if they do pose a risk to a particular location, such as a
school,'' Coyne said.
</P>
<P>
   No homeless shelters in southeastern Connecticut accept single
young men, and there are few places to put offenders where they
would not be near some youths, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The primary importance to us is that offenders receive any
support they can from us, and that offenders not live in the
community homeless, with no means of support and no one to
supervise them,'' Coyne said.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Cote, principal of St. Joseph's School, said Tuesday
she is waiting to hear more and does not want to alarm the school
community.
</P>
<P>
   ''As any school parent or teacher would be, I'm somewhat worried
about the issue,'' Cote said. ''I believe it poses a danger to our
students - if not a physical danger, then an emotional one when
parents understand what's going on in our neighborhood.''

<HEADLINE> Seagram CEO testifies he thinks MP3.com purposefully violated copyrights </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Seagram Chief Executive Officer Edgar Bronfman
Jr. testified Wednesday that he believes MP3.com purposefully
violated the copyrights of record companies to build an online
catalogue of 80,000 CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Bronfman's testimony in a civil trial in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan was brief because Judge Jed Rakoff decided that the
executive's opinions were not relevant to deciding whether MP3.com
intentionally infringed on copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   Before the reluctant witness finished his testimony, he said he
doubted MP3.com ''accidentally bought 80,000 CDs'' to load into a
service that allows customers to access favorite music from
anywhere once they prove they own the CD.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, I do believe it was a willful disregard of the law,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Universal Music Group and Interscope Records, the music arms of
Seagram, are the last plaintiffs in a lawsuit brought by the
recording industry against the San Diego-based fledging Internet
music company.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent fiscal quarter, MP3.com set aside $150
million for legal costs, including the price of settlements with
four other major music makers - Warner Music Group, BMG, EMI and
Sony Music Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com had hoped to settle with Seagram prior to the trial but
believed it was unable to do so because Seagram wanted to compete
in the Internet music space itself, the judge said as he stopped
the questioning of Bronfman.
</P>
<P>
   The judge told courtroom spectators that lawyers for MP3.com had
revealed earlier during a private conversation that they were
questioning Bronfman to expose Seagram's ''competitive motives for
pursuing this lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems to the court that that is completely irrelevant to
any issue before the court,'' the judge said. ''No one is obliged
to settle a lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Rakoff said it was common that money and competitive motives are
at the root of lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Bronfman's testimony would be irrelevant to whether
he decides MP3.com purposefully violated the copyrights or whether
stiff penalties must be imposed to warn others against violating
copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   If the judge rules against the company, MP3.com could face
penalties of up to $150,000 for each of an estimated 5,000 Seagram
CDs it put in its online music collection. Such a penalty could
approach three quarters of a billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he dismissed Bronfman because the continued
questioning of him would be ''not only a colossal waste of time but
also a misuse of a court proceeding for the airing of hard feelings
that understandably exist between the defendants and the remaining
plaintiffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he feared the trial otherwise could turn into ''a
publicity circus and we are not about to have that.''

<P>
   MASHANTUCKET, Conn. (AP) - Past the dizzying patterns,
flickering lights and frenzied tourists at Foxwoods Resort Casino
lies a secure area off limits to patrons who play by the rules.
</P>
<P>
   But those who gamble with the law are escorted by plainclothes
detectives down a lackluster white hallway and into a three-room
office that functions as a state police barracks.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the casino unit made 362 arrests at Foxwoods and 152
arrests at Mohegan Sun Casino in neighboring Montville.
</P>
<P>
   The troopers also conduct background checks on gaming employees
- more than 28,000 at Foxwoods since the casino opened in 1992 -
and escort employees carrying cash and chips across the floors of
the world's largest casino.
</P>
<P>
   Under a deal struck before Foxwoods opened, the state and the
Mashantucket Pequot tribe agreed to house a state police unit to
function as the primary law enforcement agency within the casino.
The tribe also has its own police department and state police from
the Montville barracks have jurisdiction on the reservation outside
the gaming floor.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could consider this the only foot patrol in the
Connecticut State Police,'' said Detective Patrick Graham. ''We're
constantly walking.''
</P>
<P>
   Detective Ronald Coleman, who works from midnight to 8 a.m.,
said he walks up to 20 miles per shift.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been here since day one and we handle the crimes that
take place ranging from breach of peace to disorderly conduct up to
thefts and employee schemes,'' said unit commander Lt. Edmond
Brunt.
</P>
<P>
   One ongoing case involves a man accused of stealing hundreds of
thousands of dollars from his stepfather who is suspected of
stealing the money from Mohegan Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Gahner, 22, was charged in August with concealing
information from police during their investigation of the case. He
has been in custody since early July when he was charged with
raping a woman at his Norwich home.
</P>
<P>
   His stepfather, Harlan Gahner, 54, a former Mohegan Sun
employee, was arrested several days before the alleged rape when
casino officials allegedly spotted him stuffing nearly $100,000 in
cash into his overalls while counting money in one of the ''soft
count'' rooms, police said
</P>
<P>
   State police are investigating both Gahners for the possible
theft of up to $600,000 in casino money.
</P>
<P>
   Two other people were also charged in July with hindering
prosecution and interfering with a police officer for allegedly
lying during the investigation into the Gahners.
</P>
<P>
   ''This place sort of attracts the weirdest of the weird,'' said
Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   On a night when there were just six people at the Foxwoods dance
club bar - including employees - a man pulled out a knife and
attempted to stab another man for no apparent reason, Coleman said.
The two men had never met. The assailant managed only to cut the
victim's shirt and was charged with first-degree assault.
</P>
<P>
   Graham recalled a late-night case involving a man who broke into
a gaming table and stole about $7,500 worth of chips. He was caught
on camera but got away. About a month later, he returned to the
casino where surveillance employees tracked him on camera for about
eight hours as he tried to break into a car in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Fingerprints on the car matched prints on the glass cover of the
gaming table and detectives were able to make an arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ''He then bonded himself out with the stolen chips,'' said
Graham.
</P>
<P>
   In August a Massachusetts man was charged with larceny in the
theft of two human corneas that had been donated for
transplantation.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Dellaria, 47, told state police that he thought the
plastic foam package he had stolen from a train station in Boston
was filled with lobsters, Detective Jeff Megin said. The package,
which belonged to the New England Eye &AMP; Tissue Transplant Bank, was
about the size of a 12-pack beer container. It is not clear why
Dellaria brought the ''lobsters'' to the casino, police said.
</P>
<P>
   There are few instances of violent crime at the casinos. The
most common charge is criminal trespassing, with 92 arrests at
Foxwoods in 1999 and 46 at Mohegan Sun. That includes people who
are prohibited from returning to the casino for a variety of
reasons, including drunken behavior, and compulsive gamblers who
ask the casino to keep their photograph on file and boot them out
if they refuse to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Larceny is the second most common charge with 79 arrests last
year at Foxwoods and 36 at Mohegan Sun.
</P>
<P>
   There has only been one robbery at the casino, said Coleman. A
former casino security guard knocked over a security guard as he
grabbed some bills off a gaming table.
</P>
<P>
   State police say the only people they ever found armed were
licensed firearms owners who forgot they were carrying a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Only one sexual assault arrest was made at Foxwoods last year
and troopers say there is no apparent problem with prostitution
within the casino itself. There were four narcotics arrests at
Foxwoods in 1999 and three at Mohegan Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Brunt says that he is not aware of a suicide within the casino.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a very rare suicide in the parking lot,'' said Graham,
adding that there may be others at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month each casino saw the arrest of parents who left
their children unattended while they gambled. But Sgt. Alex Aalberg
said there is not a significant problem with abandoned children.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you have a city of 40,000 or 60,000 people, you're going
to have a problem,'' said Brunt, referring to the number of casino
patrons. ''Also you have a bigger chunk of males 18-to-40.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 79 women were arrested at Foxwoods compared to 283
men. At Mohegan Sun, the ratio was 17-135.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a female suspect who kicked in an office wall bearing
the bar that held her handcuffs. Since then, the casino added a
steel panel to better secure the bar. Also added was a second area
with steel paneling and a bar to hold additional suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had small armies in here between prisoners and
security,'' said Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Troopers who volunteer to work in the unit spend a week in
Atlantic City learning to play all the games so that they can

<HEADLINE> Venice Festival Honors Eastwood  </HEADLINE>
By CANDICE HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENICE, Italy (AP) -- When Clint Eastwood came to Italy to make
the ''spaghetti'' Western that would catapult him to stardom, he
was so unknown that director Sergio Leone didn't bother to meet him
at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   That was 36 years ago. On Wednesday, the 70-year-old actor and
director was honored with a Golden Lion for lifetime achievement at
the Venice Film Festival's gala opening.
</P>
<P>
   The award was accompanied by the European premiere of ''Space
Cowboys,'' a movie about four old geezers who still have the
''right stuff,'' and a documentary tribute to Eastwood.
</P>
<P>
   It was a triumphal return by any standard and Eastwood seemed to
be savoring every moment. At a news conference with his fellow
''cowboys''-- Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland and James Garner --
Eastwood said making movies keeps him young.
</P>
<P>
   ''Acting is like being a child,'' he said. ''It's great fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Famously laconic on film, Eastwood is easy and articulate in
real life. Asked if the award had made him reflect on his legacy,
Eastwood said he didn't feel he was close enough to the end of a
career to have one.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always felt I was in the middle of it, not the end,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He did, however, reflect on the irony of a Hollywood actor
getting his first break abroad. The movie was ''A Fistful of
Dollars,'' the first of three ''spaghetti'' Westerns that Leone
directed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a little bit strange,'' Eastwood admitted.
</P>
<P>
   The movie was made on such a shoestring budget that Eastwood
even recycled his old costume from the TV series ''Rawhide.'' But
''A Fistful of Dollars'' led to a fistful of hits. Eastwood became
a Hollywood star with enough clout to realize his true desire,
directing. His 1992 Western ''Unforgiven'' won four Oscars,
including best movie and best director. There were flops along the
way as well, but Eastwood has persisted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Space Cowboys'' is a hit in the United States. It doesn't
pretend to be great art, but it's full of charm and funny jokes
about old guys. Eastwood and his co-stars all said they had a huge
amount of fun making it.
</P>
<P>
   The gala opening of the festival was the big night for Hollywood
in Venice. The next nine days will be devoted to a potpourri of
more than 150 movies from around the globe, including 20 in
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the competitors -- a dozen -- are from Europe, although
one of America's most stalwart independent filmmakers, Robert
Altman, is in the race with ''Dr. T and the Women,'' a comedy
starring Richard Gere as a gynecologist trying to juggle the women
in his life. The other U.S. entry is Julian Schabel's ''Before
Night Falls,'' starring Johnny Depp.
</P>
<P>
   The French presence is heavy this year, perhaps a sign that the
French film industry is serious about challenging Hollywood's
global domination. Two French films and six French co-productions
are in competition.
</P>
<P>
   Italy, which was snubbed by the Cannes Film Festival, is also
amply represented this year on the Lido. Four Italian films were
chosen for the competition, some say in reaction to the Cannes
snub.
</P>
<P>
   Also competing are films from Portugal, Britain, China, South
Korea, Australia, Iran, India and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The Venice Film Festival, the world's oldest, fancies itself
more artistic than the glitz-packed Cannes. Winning a Golden Lion
in Venice rarely brings commercial success, but it can endow a
filmmaker with considerable prestige.
</P>
<P>
   The festival also can serve as a good launching pad for movies,
like last year's ''Being John Malkovich,'' which won favor with
audiences and critics here.

<HEADLINE> Firefighters, family mourn man killed in shooting spree  </HEADLINE>
By NATASHA GURAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATERBURY, Conn. (AP) - Connecticut native Dennis Page traveled
eight hours from Virginia on Wednesday to join hundreds of fellow
firefighters paying last respects to Jaime Quinones, a Waterbury
firefighter killed in a weekend shooting rampage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know anyone here. It's just a big brotherhood,'' said
Page, who grew up in Killingly, graduated from the University of
Connecticut and now works as a firefighter and paramedic in
Henrico, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing black bands across their badges, the firefighters lined
the street outside the Immaculate Conception Church as Engine 10
carried the coffin of Quinones, 38, beneath crossed aerial ladders.
An American flag was suspended from the ladders.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of others - including residents who said they knew
Quinones - looked on as a police motorcade led the procession. The
Connecticut Fire Fighters Pipe Band escorted the engine, which had
its lights draped in black cloth. Color guards stood outside the
church as members of the city department lined the central steps.
</P>
<P>
   Quinones' family asked the Rev. John Blackall, pastor of another
city church, to celebrate the funeral Mass. Blackall had baptized
Quinones, a Waterbury native.
</P>
<P>
   ''The death of a fireman on duty is always an occasion for
showing the meaning of bonding,'' Blackall said. ''This bonding is
a particularly beautiful witness to the lives of firefighters.''
</P>
<P>
   Acting Fire Chief James Trainor praised Quinones for his 11
years as a Marine and 6 years on the city department.
</P>
<P>
   ''He served to protect our freedom to live in this country and
he served to protect our lives and homes,'' Trainor said of the man
he affectionately called ''Q.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the mourners were representatives of the Worcester, Mass.,
fire department, which lost six of its own members fighting a
warehouse fire in December.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a brother in the service, and when we lose a brother we
send him off fittingly,'' said Worcester Lt. Ed Ryan. ''This man,
though I've never met him, is our brother.''
</P>
<P>
   No estimate was available on the number of firefighters at the
funeral Mass, which was followed by a procession en route to a
burial service at Calvary Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Quinones was collecting money from motorists for the Muscular
Dystrophy Association ''Fill the Boot'' campaign Saturday when he
was killed.
</P>
<P>
   The rampage that began when Mark Cote, 29, got into an argument
with his neighbor, Brian Miller, remains under investigation. Cote
shot Miller, 30, twice and then stole his car.
</P>
<P>
   Cote then drove to the intersection where Quinones was killed.
Police said Cote fired at least eight shots at Quinones, then
traveled to the home of an ex-girlfriend and shot her mother,
40-year-old Maria Hernandez. Police said Cote let the ex-girlfriend
and her three children go before turning the gun on himself.
</P>
<P>
   During the Mass, Waterbury Mayor Philip Giordano asked for a
moment of silence for the other victims.

<HEADLINE> Italy Heat a Worry For Wine Growers  </HEADLINE>
By GIOVANNA DELL'ORTO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Italy's grape pickers are working 12- to 15-hour
days to complete the earliest wine harvest in memory, hurried along
by torrid summer heat that threatens to turn the crop to raisins on
the vine.
</P>
<P>
   July rains followed by two weeks in the high 90s could make for
a great year of high-alcohol, full-bodied wine -- or grapes of wrath
if the harvest isn't in soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''We try to pick the bunches that aren't too sunburned,''
harvester Barbara Chiarolanza said Wednesday on a day of picking
that started at 8 a.m. in Tuscany's Col D'Orcia vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're managing to save a lot of them. But all the vineyards
are in the sun, so we pray that from time to time we get a cloud,''
Chiarolanza said.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing hats and long pants to protect against cuts, she and the
rest of her 50-member crew are selecting, cutting, and filling
33-pound crates with the Sangiovese grapes that make what many
consider Italy's finest red wine, Brunello di Montalcino.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what's hotter -- the sun or the ground,'' the
27-year-old Chiarolanza exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   For the vineyard's wine expert, it's an unprecedented -- and
unsettling -- experience.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have been working in this territory for 20 years and
certainly this is the earliest harvest,'' Col D'Orcia oenologist
Pablo Harri said. ''Brunello in August just doesn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   From the Tuscan hilltop town of Montalcino down south to the
island of Sicily, Italy's wine growers are rushing harvesters to
scorched fields.
</P>
<P>
   ''The heat is dehydrating rather than maturing the grapes now,
so it's harvest time for everybody,'' said Giuseppe Genna with
Sicily's regional wine and vine institute in Marsala.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we can't keep harvesters working around the clock ...
Otherwise we get them withered too,'' said Enrico Viglierchio of
the Banfi winery at Montalcino, which produces Brunello along with
Merlot, Sauvignon, Chardonnay and Pinot Grigio.
</P>
<P>
   This year's harvest will end around the middle to the end of
September, its usual starting date.
</P>
<P>
   The heat and accelerated ripening mean red grapes will have a
higher sugar -- and thus alcohol -- concentration, while white grapes
risk losing a bit of their aroma.
</P>
<P>
   ''August's sun has burned the product a bit,'' said Ezio
Rivella, an internationally known wine expert. ''Quantitatively,
the harvest is meager. Qualitatively, it's good, if not great.''
</P>
<P>
   The Col D'Orcia's Harri said the Sangiovese grapes in his
vineyard appear worth the rush -- ''exceptional.''
</P>
<P>
   Northern Italian vineyards also are gearing up for an early
harvest.
</P>
<P>
   There, the harvest is expected to be good unless vineyards get
too much rain, said Beppe Veglio, an oenologist with a large wine
cooperative in the northern region of Piedmont. Piedmont produces
Barolo, which vies with Brunello as one of Italy's finest red
wines.

<HEADLINE> Report: Congressional candidate caught in nasty divorce spat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Congressional candidate Larry Seabrook is
embroiled in a bitter divorce flap with his ex-wife, who claims he
divorced her without her knowing it, according to a newspaper
report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In sealed court papers obtained by the New York Daily News,
LaVerne Seabrook said while she was in the dark about the 1993
divorce she and Larry Seabrook continued signing joint tax returns
and he got her to co-sign a $140,000 bank equity loan, the Daily
News reported. LaVerne Seabrook claimed she did not know about the
divorce until last year.
</P>
<P>
   Seabrook, a Democratic state senator from the Bronx, denied that
his ex-wife was unaware of the split. But he refused to discuss the
divorce, saying he was barred from doing so by a court order.
</P>
<P>
   Seabrook, 49, is locked in a tight primary battle with six-term
incumbent Rep. Eliot Engel in the New York Democratic Primary Sept.
12. Engel's district covers the north Bronx and southern
Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday Seabrook lashed out at Engel accusing the
congressman of attempting ''a public lynching of an opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Engel camp has denied leaking the documents.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, LaVerne Seabrook issued a statement through her
ex-husband's campaign saying she did not provide the documents to
the Daily News and said the story was painful for the couple's
children
</P>
<P>
   ''I am a private person and wish to remain so,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She could not be reached for additional comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Daily News, LaVerne Seabrook claimed in court
documents that during the years she believed they were still
married she and Larry Seabrook appeared together as husband and
wife at various political events - including a visit to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   LaVerne Seabrook acknowledged receiving the initial divorce
summons in 1990 but said she ignored it because she believed her
marital problems would blow over, the News reported. She said her
husband never again brought up his intention to divorce her and
they continued living together until 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Seabrook's lawyer said in the court documents that he never
served LaVerne Seabrook with a copy of the final 1993 divorce
decree. The divorce was granted by default, according to the News.
</P>
<P>
   Seabrook's accountant wrote a letter stating that, except for
one year, she filed joint tax returns for the Seabrooks from 1989
through 1996, the Daily News reported.
</P>
<P>
   Seabrook campaign spokeswoman Danica Gallagher said Wednesday
that tax joint returns and the equity loan the LaVerne Seabrook
co-signed for occurred the year the couple was in the midst of the
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Internal Revenue Service, a person who
knowingly files a joint tax return when no longer married could be
guilty of filing a false statement.

<HEADLINE> Osteoporosis Drug Also Works in Men  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHANIE NANO
<TEXT>
<P>
   A drug used to treat osteoporosis in women works just as well in
men who have the brittle-bone disease, a study found.
</P>
<P>
   Men account for 20 percent of the 10 million people with
osteoporosis, but there are no osteoporosis drugs approved for
general use in men.
</P>
<P>
   The latest research, reported in Thursday's New England Journal
of Medicine, is the first large study of men given an osteoporosis
drug.
</P>
<P>
   ''We perceive it as a women's disease and have totally ignored
the fact that a lot of men are affected,'' said one of the
researchers, Dr. Eric Orwoll of the Oregon Health Sciences
University in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Osteoporosis weakens bones and leads to painful and crippling
fractures. It afflicts an estimated 8 million women and 2 million
men in the United States, according to the National Osteoporosis
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Men are at less risk because they have larger, stronger bones
and do not suffer the bone loss experienced by women after
menopause. The risk factors for men include low testosterone
levels, medications such as steroids, smoking, heavy drinking and
lack of exercise.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, researchers found that the drug Fosamax, also
known as alendronate, was equally effective in men and women in
increasing bone density, reducing fractures of the spine and
preventing decreases in height.
</P>
<P>
   Orwoll said the researchers expected to see comparable results.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the fact that the results were so similar -- that there was
absolutely no difference between the genders -- is surprising,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year study involved 241 men ages 31 to 87 who have
osteoporosis. One hundred forty-six received a daily dose of
Fosamax; 95 got a dummy pill. All participants were also given
calcium and vitamin D.
</P>
<P>
   In the Fosamax group, bone density increased 7 percent in the
spine; 3 percent in the hip; and 2 percent overall. Those who took
a dummy pill had a 2 percent increase in bone density in the spine
but no significant change in the hip or whole body.
</P>
<P>
   There were fewer spine fractures in the Fosamax group (0.8
percent) than in the comparison group (7 percent). Height decreased
by 0.09 inches in the comparison group, while the decrease in the
Fosamax group was 0.02 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. C. Conrad Johnston Jr., president of the National
Osteoporosis Foundation, said the study is good news for men who
have osteoporosis, which he said is underdiagnosed in both men and
women.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly any man who has a fragility fracture -- just like any
woman -- ought to be evaluated because they could well have
osteoporosis,'' he said. ''And now we know drugs work as well in
men as they do in women.''
</P>
<P>
   Merck &AMP; Co., which makes Fosamax and funded the study, is
seeking approval of Fosamax for treating osteoporosis in men.
</P>
<P>
   Fosamax was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1995
for postmenopausal osteoporosis and is the top-selling osteoporosis
drug. Fosamax and another drug, Actonel, are approved for
osteoporosis caused by steroid use in both men and women.

<HEADLINE> Wildfire Fight To Cost $1 Billion  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal cost of fighting wildfires across
the West soon will exceed $1 billion with Congress likely to dip
into the treasury again this year to pay the final tab, federal
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the federal government has tallied at least $626 million
in costs to battle scores of fires from Montana to New Mexico,
spending as much as $18 million a day, according to the National
Interagency Fire Center, which is coordinating the firefighting
effort.
</P>
<P>
   But several senior administration officials -- after an internal
review of the worst outbreak of wildfires in half a century -- said
it has become clear the firefighting costs will exceed $1 billion
before long.
</P>
<P>
   ''Actual costs will be right at about a billion dollars,''
predicted Hank Kashdan, budget director for the U.S. Forest
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the fire control center said their running tally of
$626 million is conservative and may understate overall costs
because it focuses only on direct firefighting and does not include
tens of millions of dollars spent this year on preparedness and
training and other fire activities.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of the bills won't come in until after the fire season
is over,'' said Lorraine Buck, a spokeswoman for the interagency
group that has set up headquarters in Boise, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Forest Service and the Interior Department already have
spent just over $1 billion this year on all of their fire programs
-- direct firefighting and preparedness -- with another month of the
fire season remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're depleting all available reserves. ... We're going to be
looking at fire suppression costs far in excess of what we have
available,'' said Kashdan.
</P>
<P>
   Just before leaving for its summer recess, Congress came up with
an additional $350 million for fighting the wildfires, bringing the
total amount budgeted for direct firefighting to $836 million this
year.
</P>
<P>
   While that is expected to fall short of what will be needed,
officials emphasized the money will be found.
</P>
<P>
   ''Money is not an issue. The money is there to do what is
necessary,'' said Linda Ricci, a spokeswoman for the
administration's Office of Management and Budget. She said the
Forest Service and Interior Department have discretion to
temporarily shift funds from other areas of their budget and that
the administration is prepared to ask Congress for additional funds
if needed when lawmakers return in September.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money so far has been spent on salaries and support
for more than 27,000 firefighters battling the western blazes,
including several thousand soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service has 16,000 people involved in firefighting
activities, half of its work force, according to an agency
spokeswoman. More than 1,200 fire engines, 240 helicopters and 42
tanker aircraft have been deployed.
</P>
<P>
   This year's fire season is believed by Interior Department and
Forest Service officials to be the worst in 50 years. So far nearly
73,000 fires have burned nearly 6.3 million acres, about a third in
Idaho and Montana. Two million acres have been scorched in the two
states alone.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration estimates that the value of lost
forest, rangeland and wildlife habitat -- as well as economic losses
to businesses -- could exceed $10 billion. In Montana alone, the
fires were estimated to be costing businesses $3 million a day as
vast areas of forest were closed to the public.
</P>
<P>
   This year's fires also have unleashed a political firestorm, as
Republicans have contended the Clinton administration's policy of
limiting logging contributed to the fire risk, and that the
administration was unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   ''The (federal) agencies knew with certainty that fire seasons
such as the one we are currently experiencing were going to
occur,'' claimed Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, chairman of the House
Resources Committee. He cited a General Accounting Office report
last year that concluded 40 million acres of federal forest in the
interior West were at high risk of catastrophic wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   Young said the administration ''should have geared up'' their
fire activities.
</P>
<P>
   However, Congress was not giving fire activities top priority
either. Last fall, it approved $957 million for all fire programs
for this fiscal year, $15 million less than the White House had
sought, according to the Office of Management and Budget.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the worst fire season we've had in a long time,'' said
Jon Wright, an Interior Department spokesman. ''Nobody could have
predicted that we would have this many fires going on at the same
time.''

<HEADLINE> Gore to appear on ''Late Show'' on Sept. 14  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Get ready for questions about The Kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has accepted an invitation to appear on
the ''Late Show'' with David Letterman on Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic presidential candidate will undoubtedly be asked
about his convention lip-lock with his wife, Tipper. The ''Late
Show'' has repeatedly run taped footage of the lengthy kiss.
</P>
<P>
   It will be Gore's first appearance with Letterman since they
both donned eye goggles in 1993 to watch Gore smash ashtrays with a
hammer.
</P>
<P>
   Letterman has invited Gore and Republican presidential candidate
George W. Bush to debate on his show. The two haven't agreed to do
this.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's office has promised an answer within the week on whether
he will appear on the show - with or without Gore, CBS spokeswoman
Rosemary Keenan said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush appeared on the ''Late Show'' on March 1.

<HEADLINE> Ramapo College delays opening by a week due to water contamination  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MAHWAH, N.J. (AP) - Ramapo College of New Jersey will delay the
start of its fall semester after bacteria were discovered in the
school's water supply.
</P>
<P>
   The college will pump large doses of chlorine through its pipes
and is advising people not to drink water from the system until the
problem is cleared up.
</P>
<P>
   Classes originally scheduled to begin on Sept. 6 will instead
begin Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   The contamination was discovered after tests were conducted as
part of the school's application for a certificate of occupancy in
the newly constructed Maple Hall.
</P>
<P>
   After the chlorination is finished, new tests will be done to
ensure the bacteria are gone.
</P>
<P>
   College spokeswoman Bonnie Franklin said Mahwah officials told
the school such contamination often occurs with new construction.
The college gets its water from Mahwah's municipal water system,
which draws it from wells, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the college and municipal officials don't know how the
coliform bacteria got into the pipes, but said the contamination
could have occurred while pipes were exposed outdoors before being
installed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may never know,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the college said, drinking fountains have been
turned off and bottled water is being provided. The Mahwah Health
Department has determined the water is safe to use for all
nondrinking purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman orientation and move-in is now scheduled for Sept. 9,
and upperclassmen are to move in the following day.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Be Sued in Diana Case  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The father of Dodi Fayed said Wednesday he
will file suit in federal court to gain access to U.S. intelligence
information about the deaths of Princess Diana and his son in a
Paris automobile accident.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since that tragic day three years ago, I have not rested in my
search for the truth,'' Mohamed Al Fayed said in a written
statement read at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Al Fayed, who owns Harrods department store in London, repeated
his claim that the Aug. 31, 1997, deaths were a murder conspiracy
plotted by people who disapproved of Diana's relationship with his
son.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was seeking documents from the CIA, the Justice
Department and the National Security Agency, which he said
monitored Diana's telephone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States' intelligence gathering network, which
through the most sophisticated satellite systems, allowed the NSA
to spy on Diana,'' Al Fayed said. He charged that the agency gave
files on the monitored conversations to British intelligence and
still has over a thousand pages of documents concerning the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe they are withholding some of the documents at the
request of the British secret services,'' Al Fayed said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Justice Department spokesman Charles Miller nor NSA
spokeswoman Judi Emmel would comment, citing the pending
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   NSA officials acknowledged in 1998 that the agency had picked up
mentions of Diana in its international electronic monitoring, but
said those references were casual and incidental and that she was
never a target of U.S. intelligence efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In April, an appeals court rejected Al Fayed's request for the
information, upholding the decision of a lower court judge who said
Al Fayed had tried ''to make an end run around'' the Freedom of
Information Act.
</P>
<P>
   Al Fayed's lawyer, Mark Zaid, said the new Freedom of
Information Act lawsuit would be filed in U.S. District Court in
Washington on Thursday, the third anniversary of the crash. The
lawsuit seeks information about more than 20 individuals and events
related to the deaths, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one suspects the U.S. government was involved'' in the
accident, Zaid said. But he said that government might be
withholding information.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also seeks CIA and Justice Department documents
concerning Oswald LeWinter, who attempted to sell Al Fayed phony
information about a murder plot against Diana and his son. LeWinter
was convicted of attempted criminal fraud and sentenced to four
years in an Austrian prison in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield also declined to comment on the
specifics of the lawsuit because it hasn't yet been filed or
reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We understand Mr. Al Fayed's grief and tremendous sense of
loss but any suggestion that the CIA spied on Dodi Fayed or
Princess Diana, has knowledge of any plot to murder them, or had
anything to do with this tragic accident is totally unfounded,''
Mansfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Doubts already have been cast on a number of Al Fayed's
allegations concerning Diana's death, including that a mysterious
nurse heard last words from the princess and that Diana and Dodi
Fayed planned to marry.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Zaid and John Macnamara, director of
security for Harrods, showed security camera footage of Diana, Dodi
Fayed and their driver Henri Paul before the accident, to dispute
allegations that Paul was drunk. Paul also died in the crash and
was found to have high levels of alcohol in his blood.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a lot of unanswered questions, but without the
cooperation of the United States government, I don't believe we
ever will get'' the answers, Macnamara said.
</P>
<P>
   Diana and Dodi Fayed died after they left the Ritz Hotel and set
off at high speed in their chauffeured car, trying to elude
photographers. Mohamed Al Fayed owns the Ritz and was Paul's
employer.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, Paris judge Herve Stephan dismissed charges
against nine photographers and a press motorcyclist implicated in
the accident. The judge's terse conclusion came in a one-page
statement: Alcohol, drugs and excessive speed caused the crash that
ended the life of the ''people's princess.''
</P>
<P>
   A French court is expected to rule September 15 on an appeal by
Al Fayed and Paul's family to reopen the crash investigation.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Readies Clinton Security  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) -- Colombian troops and police mounted
one of their biggest security operations ever for President
Clinton's visit Wednesday, posting snipers on rooftops and along
the stone wall around this colonial city.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton coming to cement a $1.3 billion U.S. aid package to
fight drug trafficking and rebels who protect drug crops, Colombian
security forces were prepared for any attack.
</P>
<P>
   Two Colombian warships patrolled the azure Caribbean waters off
Cartagena, and police helicopters buzzed the city. Military divers
clad in wetsuits searched Cartagena's bay and port for bombs.
</P>
<P>
   On highways approaching the city, soldiers had days earlier
erected roadblocks and frisked motorists and bus passengers for
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the precautions, police dismantled in a Cartagena
neighborhood what they described as a small homemade explosive
device meant to scatter rebel leaflets denouncing Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Troops were on edge, ready to respond to any threat.
</P>
<P>
   At midday, a half-dozen Colombian marines posted at the city's
clock tower went onto the alert when someone heard an electronic
beeping sound from under a wooden cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that it might be a bomb, the soldiers anxiously peered
under the cabinet. They saw that the beeping was coming from a
cheap wristwatch whose alarm had gone off.
</P>
<P>
   Some 5,000 Colombian police and soldiers participated in the
operation to protect Clinton, the military said. They were
augmented by hundreds of U.S. personnel.
</P>
<P>
   But the Colombians took pains not to make this city, declared a
World Heritage Site by UNESCO and which was first settled in 1533,
not to appear like an armed camp.
</P>
<P>
   Many security members wore civilian clothes and mixed in with
the crowds who greeted Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a lot of security, but we're not drawing attention to
ourselves,'' said Colombian marine corporal Carlos Martinez, one of
the troops stationed at the clock tower. ''Our objective is to be
unseen.''
</P>
<P>
   Above him, barely visible, was a sniper peering through his
scope.

<HEADLINE> State Labor Department orders Pepsi to pay overtime and release records </HEADLINE>
By LORI HINNANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The state Department of Labor has ordered
Pepsi Bottling Group to pay overtime and interest to 13 workers and
to turn over wage records for other employees at its four New
Jersey facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, released Wednesday, followed five years of
litigation and will affect more than 300 Pepsi employees in New
Jersey, according to James L. Linsey, an attorney at the law firm
Cohen, Weiss and Simon, which represented the employees.
</P>
<P>
   The Somers, N.Y., company plans to appeal, according to
spokesperson Kelly McAndrew.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that the commissioner of labor has erred in a
number of issues in this decision,'' McAndrew said.
</P>
<P>
   In the case, a group of 13 employees involved in shelving Pepsi
beverages and maintaining the stock at large grocery stores and
small delicatessens claimed they were due overtime wages for time
worked in addition to their regular 40-hour week.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi claimed the employees served as sales representatives and
were exempt from New Jersey wage laws.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Labor upheld a previous ruling by an
administrative law judge in deciding that the 13 employees in the
original case were not sales representatives and were entitled to
overtime pay and interest dating to 1993. It also ordered Pepsi to
begin paying all other such employees overtime.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Wednesday decision also demanded that the
company turn over wage records dating back to 1993 to determine if
other employees are eligible for past overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The administrative law judge's decision did not require
interest, nor did it request wage records for other employees.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Smith, a spokesman for the state Department of Labor, said
the Wednesday decision affirms that the employees ''are hourly
workers and that they're covered under New Jersey's wage law.'' The
wage records, he said, will allow the department not only to see
which other employees might be affected by the decision, but also
''to see what the pattern is what the workers are doing and how
they're being paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Linsey said the number of other employees that could be affected
is more than 300 in New Jersey and added that the decision, which
he estimated could cost Pepsi as much as $20 million, has national
implications both for Pepsi and similar companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't believe their system for manufacture and distribution
in New Jersey is unique,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Linsey said he was not concerned about the possibility of an
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each time Pepsi's appealed something,'' he said, ''it's gotten
worse for them, not better.''

<HEADLINE> Jury begins deliberating in officer shooting case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MAYVILLE, N.Y. (AP) - Jurors on Wednesday began deliberating the
case of a Jamestown man accused of shooting and critically wounding
an undercover police officer last September.
</P>
<P>
   James Lewis Jr., 19, is charged with two counts of first-degree
attempted murder for allegedly shooting Police Officer David
Mitchell in the face and then shooting at his partner, Officer R.
Scott DePietro.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell lost an eye and some of his hearing in the shooting but
has since been promoted to detective in the Jamestown Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   During closing arguments Wednesday, defense attorney Ned Barone
told jurors there was no evidence to convict Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ballistics came back negative, the fingerprints came back
negative. There was no actual testing of the blood on any of the
objects,'' Barone said. ''There was no physical evidence,
whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney James Subjack disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the gun, we have the clothing. We have a description
of the clothing. We have a description of him,'' he said. ''There's
plenty of evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to attempted murder, Lewis is charged with one count
each of aggravated assault on a police officer, attempted
aggravated assault on a police officer and criminal use of a
firearm.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, he could face 50 years to life in prison.

<HEADLINE> Compromise Sought in Burundi Talks  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYNE SAMBIRA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) -- Four Tutsi political parties who
refused to sign a Burundi peace agreement without a cease-fire said
Wednesday they were ready to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   Burundi President Pierre Buyoya signed a power sharing accord
Monday, paving the way for ending a 7-year civil war, with
President Clinton, mediator Nelson Mandela and 12 African leaders
looking on in the Tanzanian city of Arusha. The Tutsi-led
government and army as well as Hutu and Tutsi political parties
also signed.
</P>
<P>
   But Hutu rebels and four out of 10 Tutsi parties refused to sign
the document, despite pressure from Mandela who promised to obtain
the cease-fire later.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not saying that we will not sign. But we have put
forward conditions and we're waiting,'' said Joseph Nzeyimana,
leader of the Raddes party. ''We are going to put a lot of pressure
on Mandela, just like he did on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela had criticized the four parties for refusing to sign the
agreement, which would create an ethnically balanced army,
government and parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Buyoya said the peace process was incomplete and warned he would
struggle on against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the rebels continue to refuse to negotiate, we will ask the
region, the international community and all the others to help us
fight the rebels until they realize they will not get anywhere with
violence and massacres,'' Buyoya told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II on Wednesday said Burundi had been ''bloodied
by seven absurd years of civil war,'' and implored the combatants
to commit to a lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ask you to pray so that the populace's desire for
reconciliation will come to be realized by all the interested
parties and the neighboring states, so that a lasting and stable
peace can be reached quickly,'' John Paul said at his summer
retreat at Castel Gandolfo. About two-thirds of Burundi's people
are Roman Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the four balking Tutsi parties said they wanted
changes in the document to ensure that rights for the minority
Tutsis be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Tutsis dominate the army and economy of Hutu-majority Burundi.
Civil war broke out in 1993 upon the assassination of Burundi's
first and only democratically elected president, a Hutu. Fighting
since then has killed 200,000 people in the nation of roughly 6
million.

<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - Xerox is going trendy.
</P>
<P>
   The business machine maker has just launched the most expensive
advertising campaign in its history featuring Blue Dog, the popular
pup with bright yellow eyes who has a cultlike following.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Blue Dog - the subject of popular paintings by New
Orleans artist George Rodrigue - is no accident for a manufacturer
often seen as a stodgy, Old Economy company.
</P>
<P>
   At a cost of more than $200 million, Xerox hopes the ads will
spread the word that it makes high-tech inkjet printers for the
small and home office market for as little as $149.
</P>
<P>
   The company's outdated image - it is best known as a maker of
old-style, high priced copiers - is just one of the problems at
Xerox, once considered a symbol of corporate success.
</P>
<P>
   Its products were so popular in the 1960s and '70s that it
fought to ensure that ''Xerox'' did not become a generic verb for
photocopying.
</P>
<P>
   But profits are down sharply, a botched sales force
reorganization has alienated customers and its stock price has
plummeted to one-third of its value a year ago. The stock has
hovered around $16.50 a share, near its recent low of $14.56 and
far below its high of $50.12&AMP;frac12; a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the company announced it would slash 5,200 jobs and
close manufacturing plants to reduce its cost structure so it could
stay competitive with companies such as Hewlett-Packard, Canon and
Ricoh.
</P>
<P>
   And both the company and the Securities &AMP; Exchange Commission
are investigating accounting irregularities involving its Mexican
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The last year was not supposed to be a nightmare for Xerox. In
April 1999, the company made Rick Thoman its chief executive.
Thoman was a former IBM executive credited with helping to engineer
that company's turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Thoman, who had joined Xerox in 1997, had already been
instrumental in the company's push to sell its digital products in
low-end retail outlets such as Staples and Office Max.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Xerox was already struggling to reduce costs as it
shifted from old-style copiers that operate with lenses and lights
to multipurpose digital models that can be upgraded to print, scan
and fax documents when connected to personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   The company was also in the midst of cutting 9,000 jobs, or just
under 10 percent of its worldwide work force.
</P>
<P>
   But the sales force realignment was executed clumsily and slowed
productivity and sales. The idea was to reorganize the sales force
by industry, rather than the traditional geographic organization
used by Xerox for years.
</P>
<P>
   Thoman was fired in May, just 13 months after he took the helm.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Allaire, who Thoman had replaced as CEO, agreed to come
back on a temporary basis. The company elevated Anne Mulcahy to
President and Chief Operating Officer and made it clear she was
being groomed for the CEO job.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Xerox had to report embarrassing problems in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Although the company was initially vague about the problems, it
later disclosed that several senior managers had collaborated to
circumvent Xerox accounting policies. They allegedly created false
product orders to inflate revenues.
</P>
<P>
   That resulted in a $78 million charge against second-quarter
earnings to cover bad debt and unrecorded liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox fired several top Mexican executives, including the
general manager and finance director.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican charge, coupled with a revenue decline for certain
products, helped push second-quarter earnings down 68 percent to
$145 million, or 19 cents per share, compared with $448 million, or
62 cents per share in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In July, during a conference call with analysts, Xerox
executives were surprisingly candid about the extent of the
company's problems.	   Allaire warned analysts to lower their expectations for
the
second half of the year. And Mulcahy said things had gotten so bad
that, ''Xerox people have lost confidence in management.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a feeling the company has lost its sense of
direction,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, she said, employees had grown increasingly frustrated
with the company's slow reaction to the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our issues kept us focused internally instead of on the market
and the competition,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mulcahy said the reorganization of the sales force is now
complete and the turnover rate for salespeople has dropped. She
said the company hoped to keep its strongest producers through
pumped-up salaries and bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Both Allaire and Mulcahy declined requests for interviews for
this article.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the company's internal problems are really just
symptoms of a larger problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cause of their problems really has to do with the fact
that they're caught between a rock and a hard place,'' said Shebly
Seyrafi, an analyst at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons. ''Their core market is
the copier market and that copier market is in decline.''
</P>
<P>
   The market is down in part because many workers prefer to use
printers linked to their computers rather than copying machines.
</P>
<P>
   In the digital copier market, Xerox has been No. 1 for two years
in a row.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the company had 37 percent of the market, followed by
Sharp, at 18 percent, and Canon, at 11 percent, according to
figures provided by IDC, formerly known as International Data
Corp., a market research and consulting company based in
Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But in the total copier market - analog and digital - Canon led
in 1999, with 31 percent, followed by Xerox, 29 percent, and Sharp,
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It is in the small and home office market that Xerox really lags
behind its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   In the inkjet market of multifunction machines - those that can
copy, fax and print all from a computer - Hewlett-Packard is
crushing Xerox and other competitors. H-P had 52 percent of the
market in 1999, compared to only 8 percent for Xerox. Canon came in
second with 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox has tried to make inroads in the small and home office
market. In March, the company announced a $2 billion alliance with
Sharp and Fuji Xerox to develop and manufacture inkjet products for
small and home offices.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox has also formed a partnership with Dell Computers under
which that company will sell Xerox laser printers.
</P>
<P>
   The new Blue Dog advertising campaign is aimed at showing
customers that this one-time maker of old-style copiers now also
makes products for small and home offices.
</P>
<P>
   In new television commercials, brightly colored paintings of
various small businesses are featured in an art gallery, with the
Blue Dog prominent in each, while an announcer extolls the virtues
of a $149 Xerox printer. ''They're just a smarter breed of inkjet
printer,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Always faithful to its owner,'' reads a print ad showing Blue
Dog watching over a printer.
</P>
<P>
   But will the new campaign work?
</P>
<P>
   ''The market sees them as this purveyor of antiquated or older
technology and the market has moved on. Copying was big in the
'60s; printing has been big for 10 years,'' said Seyrafi.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have praised the company's decision last year to
purchase the color printing division of Tektronix Inc., a move that
makes Xerox second only to Hewlett-Packard in the office color
printing market.
</P>
<P>
   But they say it may be a while before Xerox can pull out of its
recent slump.
</P>
<P>
   ''They may be coming out of it, but if they do they are going to
be coming out of their problems in the 2001 time frame, not anytime
this year,'' said Seyrafi.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Kmetz, a director at IDC, said Xerox will be able to turn
things around, but not in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're too much of a major player and a dominant provider of
products to just crumble and die,'' Kmetz said. ''I would expect to
see Xerox rally.''

<HEADLINE> Notorious art dealer faces more than seven years in prison  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A notorious art dealer convicted of threatening
to kidnap a lawyer's 4-year-old daughter was sentenced to seven
years and one month in prison Wednesday after apologizing to his
victims.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew J. Crispo, 55, told U.S. District Judge Alvin K.
Hellerstein, ''I deserve my punishment and I am ready to accept
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Crispo, a prominent art and antiques dealer, was convicted by a
jury of attempted extortion and obstruction of justice after he
threatened to kidnap the 4-year-old child of an attorney, Sandy
Mayerson, who worked on his bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Hellerstein ordered the prison term and required Crispo to pay
$45,000 in restitution to the mother of the child he threatened and
another $45,000 in fines. After the sentencing, Mayerson declined
to comment to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I accept full responsibility for my actions and have no ill
will for the victims of this matter,'' Crispo told Hellerstein.
''My character's been bared before this court, both good and bad,
and I am ready to accept my fate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hellerstein urged Crispo to mend himself in prison so that he
can return to his profession and contribute to society.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a life after prison,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He imposed a sentenced harsher than what federal sentencing
guidelines would normally require because of what he called the
''extreme psychological injury'' he caused on his victims.
</P>
<P>
   Crispo's latest legal troubles arose after he filed for
bankruptcy in May 1996 and a trustee was appointed to overlook his
estate, which included several businesses, a Manhattan penthouse
and a multimillion-dollar Charleston, S.C., mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors alleged Crispo made numerous threats to Mayerson,
who worked for a law firm that was helping administer his estate.
</P>
<P>
   The threats grew especially serious on May 21, 1999 when Crispo
became angry that a check was not ready for him, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   He then told a paralegal that he would kidnap Mayerson's
4-year-old daughter, saying he knew what park she played in and
that he had photographs of her, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, investigators found a book in Crispo's
apartment entitled, ''Missing, Stranger Abduction, Smart Strategies
to Keep your Child Safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The threat to kidnap the child was taken seriously because of
Crispo's prior threats and because he was believed to have arranged
to have the girl photographed as she played in Central Park two
years earlier, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Crispo grew up in a Philadelphia orphanage before gaining
prominence in his career and then attracting notoriety in the 1980s
when he was implicated but never charged in a Rockland County
murder.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, one of Crispo's employees was convicted in the killing
of a Norwegian fashion student whose body had been found in
Rockland County wearing only a mask used in sadomasochistic
rituals. He was partially burned with two bullet holes in the back
of his head.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant accused Crispo of ordering the killing at the end
of a sexual encounter. Crispo was never charged and he was
acquitted in 1988 of charges of torturing another man.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 112; Nasdaq Gains 22  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chip stocks tumbled in sluggish trading
Wednesday as investors remained wary of a slowdown in profits in
the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of brokerage companies surged early in the session on
news that Credit Suisse had agreed to buy Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette for $11.5 billion. But the boost wasn't enough to lift the
broader markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 112.09 at
11,103.01.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index was up
21.64 at 4,103.81, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down
7.25 at 1,502.59.
</P>
<P>
   So-called old economy stocks fell after appliance maker
Whirlpool said its earnings would probably fall in the second half
following a major distributor's decision to leave the appliance
business. In addition, the company said pricing pressures in North
America and Europe could also drag down profits.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest in a series of profit warnings issued by old
line, industrial companies.
</P>
<P>
   After plunging early in the session, Whirlpool closed unchanged
at $37.88. But Whirlpool competitor and Dow component General
Electric fell $2 to $57.81 on similar concerns that pricing
pressures will reduce earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Retail stocks were again hammered on fears of reduced consumer
spending in the second half of the year. Wal-Mart dropped $1.75 to
$48.19.
</P>
<P>
   John Caldwell, director of portfolio strategies for McDonald
Investments in Cleveland, said investors traded mostly on momentum
Wednesday, and, lacking any positive news, the momentum was
downward.
</P>
<P>
   Other Dow components such as IBM, down $2.56 at $130.31, fell on
profit-taking after several days of gains, Caldwell noted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in a market where a lot of people are already leaving
for the long weekend,'' added Al Goldman, chief investment
strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis. ''Business is thin
and nobody wants to take a big stance. There's just a lot of
boredom on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Trading volume has been at its lowest levels of the year for
more than a week now, with many traders taking vacations ahead of
the long Labor Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerages and financial services stocks gained after Credit
Suisse Group said it was buying DLJ for $11.5 billion, sending DLJ
shares up $6.13 to $88.38 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in other financial companies rose on anticipation of
further consolidation in the brokerage industry, including J.P.
Morgan, up $2.06 at $151.06.
</P>
<P>
   Helping the Nasdaq, Amazon.com rose $3.31 to $42.94 following
some bullish comments from a Goldman Sachs analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by a narrow margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1 billion
shares, up from Tuesday's pace of 985 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 2.70 at 532.33.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.40 percent.
Germany's DAX index was down 1.49 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
up 0.44 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.01 percent.

<HEADLINE> Senate president wants increases in prescription drug plan  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey Senate President Donald T.
DiFrancesco wants more seniors and disabled residents getting
state-funded discount prescription drug programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican lawmaker announced his $60 million prescription
plan at a news conference Wednesday in Newark, a day after he said
patients should have the right to sue HMO companies for medical
malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, DiFrancesco, who is considering a run for governor
next year, announced a $400 million property tax rebate program.
</P>
<P>
   The prescription plan would give coverage to seniors and
handicapped residents who can't get existing state programs,
DiFrancesco, R-Union, said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is designed to provide a safety net for middle-class
seniors and the disabled who are truly falling between the cracks
of prescription coverage,'' the senator said.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's share of the national tobacco settlement will cover
the tab, DiFrancesco said.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed ''Senior Gold'', the program would cover approximately
100,000 residents 65 or older or those receiving Social Security
benefits. Single people earning up to $28,588 and couples with an
income of up to $32,791 would qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Prescriptions would be filled at any pharmacy. Each prescription
would costs users a $15 co-payment plus 50 percent of the drug's
cost. Those with more than $3,000 in expenses a year would have all
of their drug costs covered with just the co-payment.
</P>
<P>
   The program's cost is the largest single price tag in the
package of bills DiFrancesco proposed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   All the other proposals would cost state taxpayers roughly $60
million if they became law.
</P>
<P>
   The largest items include funding for hospital charity care
programs that would increase by $30 million. Medicaid
reimbursements to physicians would jump by $7 million. Another $4
million would go to establish emergency room clinics in urban
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco also called for changes in state law that he said
would benefit health care consumers. Those included the ability to
sue HMO insurance carriers, require arbitration and mandate
financial accountability
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman offered similar proposals Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said DiFrancesco's suggestions ''dovetail nicely'' with
her legislative proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ''What he did today and what he outlined today means that we
share the focus on these issues and that means we stand a very good
chance of getting these things through,'' Whitman said at an
appearance in Mount Laurel.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for DiFrancesco said the prescription program
would be funded annually through the tobacco settlement payment.
</P>
<P>
   ''This gives us a solid program for at least the next two
decades,'' spokeswoman Rae Hutton said. The remainder of the
programs would be funded by state budget surpluses, she said.

<HEADLINE> State Dept. Rules Out U.S. Deals  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department Wednesday ruled out
paying ransom or making any deal with rebels in the Philippines who
are holding an American hostage and threatening to execute him if
their still-undisclosed demands are not met.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Wednesday in Washington and in Manila, the
department condemned the abduction of Jeffrey Schilling of Oakland,
Calif., and called for his safe release and for the release of 18
other hostages on southern Jolo island.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Abu Sabaya rebels said in Zamboanga,
Philippines, that they will behead Schilling. Six Western hostages
were released earlier this week for a reported $6 million ransom
paid by Libya.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department steered clear of what outsiders might do to
try to free Schilling. ''We have no comment about any steps which
might be taken to secure the release of the American hostage,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   It added, however, ''we want to make it very clear that the U.S.
government does not make deals with terrorists.''

<HEADLINE> Head of CNN Domestic Leaving  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- With ratings dwindling and competitors chipping
away at its dominant news role, CNN announced a restructuring
Wednesday that included the ouster of the head of its U.S. network,
Rick Kaplan, after three years.
</P>
<P>
   CNN said it plans to more aggressively integrate its television
and Internet operations. Its parent company, Time Warner, is about
to complete its merger with America Online.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether Kaplan's job, president of CNN/USA, will
be filled. In the restructuring, his duties were dispersed among
other executives.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Kent, formerly president of Turner Broadcasting System
International, was appointed president and chief operating officer
of the CNN News Group. Eason Jordan, who has controlled CNN's
international news operation, will become CNN's chief news
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan was offered other opportunities within Time Warner but
chose not to take them, said Terence McGuirk, who oversees CNN for
Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe it best that I now move on,'' Kaplan said. In an
interview, he expressed no bitterness but said he was disappointed
he wouldn't be able to see the job through to the end of the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they were very pleased and proud with everything we
did on the air,'' he said. ''I think we were all disappointed that
the ratings have fallen.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan, a colorful 34-time Emmy winner during his long career as
producer for ABC News, joined CNN as president of its USA
operations in August 1997. He was given the mission of boosting the
network's viewership when it didn't have breaking news to depend
upon.
</P>
<P>
   Those efforts, particularly a nightly newsmagazine called
''Newsstand,'' largely failed. Fox News Channel and MSNBC siphoned
off viewers and, during good economic times, so did the financial
network CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   CNN has also been hurt by a growing number of local 24-hour
cable news networks and the reliance by more consumers on the
Internet for news updates, said Tom Johnson, chairman of the CNN
News Group.
</P>
<P>
   CNN's average daily viewership sank from 463,000 people during
the third quarter of 1997, when Kaplan started, to 288,000 during
the second three months of this year, according to Nielsen Media
Research. The prime-time dropoff was even steeper, at 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The network's second-quarter ratings were the lowest since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the things that CNN has suffered from is the lack of
long-running breaking news stories,'' said Tom Wolzien, a media
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co. ''We had a huge number of
these stories in the early 1990s when they were growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan said it was difficult to attract attention to CNN's
programs without extensive advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not promoting when MSNBC and Fox are aggressively
promoting,'' he said. ''I think that is especially harmful to
CNN.''
</P>
<P>
   McGuirk praised Kaplan in an internal memo for ''making us
smarter, faster and more committed than ever to producing the best
news coverage in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing here that's going on that has to do with
ratings, really,'' he said in an interview. ''We have got a major
merger with AOL coming up. We have a news business that is making
the transition toward a digital future that is slightly different
from its analog present.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan, whose friendship with President Clinton made
conservative activists suspicious, is a strong-willed personality
who feuded with one of his best-known anchors, Lou Dobbs, before
Dobbs left for an Internet venture.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan survived a major scandal less than a year into his
tenure, when the network had to retract a story that claimed the
U.S. military used nerve gas on defectors during the Vietnam War.
Two producers were fired as a result of the May 1998 report, and
correspondent Peter Arnett left CNN within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Walton, who has been president of the CNN/Sports Illustrated
sports news network, will be responsible for CNN's domestic news
networks and Web sites.

<HEADLINE> NHTSA Wants More Info. on Recalls  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government wants more information
from Ford Motor Co. about the overseas recall of
Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. tires that began nine months before U.S.
officials started looking into whether the tires played a role in
scores of fatal accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Rae Tyson, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, said Wednesday that the information Ford previously
submitted ''raised some more questions,'' so the agency wants
additional documentation.
</P>
<P>
   The Firestone tires the NHTSA is investigating are standard
equipment on the Ford Explorer and other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Ford sent the federal agency 40 pages on the foreign recalls on
Aug. 3, including notices sent to dealers and customers in those
countries that described which vehicles were being recalled and
procedures for replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Now the NHTSA is asking Ford for information on Firestone
defects that have been reported anywhere else in the world, details
about its products in the countries where the recalls were issued
and the speed rating of tires used on all Ford Explores sold
oversees.
</P>
<P>
   Ford spokesman Mike Vaughn said Wednesday he did not have any
information about the NHTSA's new request.
</P>
<P>
   Ford was being criticized on another front Wednesday after a
California judge said he may order a recall of as many as 2 million
Ford vehicles over concerns that they are prone to stalling, and
accused the company of deceiving federal safety investigators and
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Ford denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Ford started recalling tires in the Middle East in August 1999,
followed by Malaysia and Thailand in February, and Venezuela,
Colombia and Ecuador in May.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgstone/Firestone announced a U.S. recall on Aug. 9 of 6.5
million Firestone ATX, ATX II and Wilderness AT tires that have
been the source of hundreds of complaints to the NHTSA, including
reports of 62 deaths and more than 100 injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials said the company did not tell U.S. officials
about the foreign recalls because they believed problems with tires
in those countries were related to high temperatures and unique
driving conditions, including faster speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials in Venezuela on Tuesday denied charges the
company withheld information about tires that may have caused at
least 10 deaths, and also said the design of the Explorer did not
contribute to tread separations and blowouts. Meantime, Venezuela's
consumer protection agency said it will issue a report this week
holding Ford and Bridgestone/Firestone responsible for the fatal
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Kane, president of Strategic Safety, which is researching
the case for lawyers suing Ford and Bridgestone/Firestone, said
what NHTSA learns about the tires in other countries could be key
to how the U.S. investigation proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are the countries who had the early warning signs,'' he
said. ''To the extent that the tires are essentially the same
tires, it's going to be very important for them to see why these
companies initiated programs first oversees and not the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA officials have said they did not receive reports of deaths
related to the tires until this year and were not told of the
foreign recalls. They said they opened an investigation when they
knew there was a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Congress plans to examine the recall next week. Rep. Billy
Tauzin, R-La., will preside over a joint hearing Wednesday of two
Commerce Committee subcommittees.
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin's spokesman said Tuesday he was ''miffed'' that Ford
chief executive Jac Nasser has declined to testify, saying he was
too busy overseeing the recall. In his place will be Helen
Petrauskas, vice president of environmental and safety engineering,
and Tom Baughman, who led the Ford team that analyzed the Firestone
data leading to Firestone's voluntary recall.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone/Firestone chief executive Masatoshi Ono has accepted
the invitation to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses can be subpoenaed to testify, but Tauzin spokesman Ken
Johnson said there are no plans to do that with Nasser.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were hoping that Mr. Nasser would testify voluntary, but
now that he's declined we have important business ahead of us next
week and we are moving on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain also had
scheduled a recall hearing for Wednesday, but pushed it back to
Sept. 12.

<HEADLINE> NJ and Pentagon promise cheaper, quicker base cleanups  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - New Jersey environmental officials and U.S.
military officials promise quicker, cheaper cleanups of
contaminated land at bases throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   State Environmental Commissioner Robert Shinn Jr. and
representatives of the Army, Air Force, Navy and Defense Logistics
Agency signed an agreement Wednesday that will allow the Pentagon
to address cleanups at more than 500 sites as a package rather than
one installation at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ''This agreement is important because it's going to help us
clean up military sites in New Jersey faster, better and cheaper,''
said Sherri W. Goodman, deputy under secretary of defense for
environmental security.
</P>
<P>
   It means, she said, ''cutting red tape.''
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department oversees and pays for the cleanup
projects, with the state acting as regulator.
</P>
<P>
   Through its Environmental Restoration Program, the Department of
Defense is responsible for cleaning up more than 27,000 sites at
over 8,500 military installations and properties, including active,
closing, and realigning bases and formerly used defense sites.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey has 567 contaminated sites at 29 military
installations, some of which have been partially or fully shuttered
in past rounds of base closings. Seventy-five additional
contaminated sites are on ''formerly used defense sites'' that the
military no longer owns, but is responsible to clean.
</P>
<P>
   The most widely contaminated installation appears to be
Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County, home to 175 of the state's 567
contaminated sites.
</P>
<P>
   That's no surprise, Shinn said, since use of Picatinny by the
military traces back to the Civil War. Back then, he said, disposal
strategy was little more than ''find a site and bury it.''
</P>
<P>
   The estimated cost to clean up all the New Jersey sites is $370
million. Goodman said the agreement could save $50 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   The most expensive individual project in New Jersey, according
to the Pentagon, is a $19.8 million cleanup at a formerly used
defense site in Cape May. Next, at $17.2 million, is a cleanup
project at Fort Dix.
</P>
<P>
   Not covered by the agreement are the most seriously contaminated
properties that are already part of the federal ''Superfund''
program.
</P>
<P>
   Properties that fall under the agreement include the Bomarc
missile site near McGuire Air Force Base, where the soil was
tainted 40 years ago when plutonium spilled from a nuclear warhead,
and the Warren Grove Bombing Range in Burlington County, where
dummy warheads dropped for target practice must be collected and
removed.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, cleanups will no longer be handled on a
case-by-case basis, with base commanders forwarding a request
through several layers of bureaucracy. Different branches of the
military will work cooperatively if each has a cleanup project at a
given base.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's good for us because we're going to do a lot more cleanups
a lot more rapidly,'' Shinn said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is similar to one struck in 1997 between the
Defense Department and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Defense officials said talks are under way with Virginia, West
Virginia, Maryland, New York, Illinois and North Carolina about
reaching similar agreements.

<HEADLINE> DiFrancesco pushes bills that sound like campaign planks  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The state constitution says he's the acting
governor when the elected governor is out of state.
</P>
<P>
   Many say Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco, R-Union, is
acting like a governor now, nearly 15 months away from when voters
will be asked to choose Gov. Christie Whitman's replacement.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, DiFrancesco talked health care reform. Last week,
it was property tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   The talk after his announcements: His news conferences seemed
more like campaign stops than legislative proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ''Will it bother me? Yes. Will I handle it? Yes,'' DiFrancesco
said Wednesday. ''I expect it. It's not going to deter me from
doing what I have been doing for these years as Senate president.''
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco repeatedly denounced all charges that his proposals
were designed to help put him in the governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for his $400 million in property tax rebates came after
talks with residents around the state all demanding relief,
DiFrancesco said.
</P>
<P>
   Work on his $60 million prescription drug offering and $60
million more in health care initiatives began in January, the
senator said.
</P>
<P>
   But still the talk that DiFrancesco is walking a candidate's
walk follows.
</P>
<P>
   ''You tend to ignore it. You laugh it off,'' DiFrancesco said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You say that's beside the point. These are things we're
planning to do anyway. These are things the majority should be
doing, the Legislature should be doing in these good times.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman is barred by state law from seeking a third term.
Republicans looking to succeed her include DiFrancesco or possibly
Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, R-Salem.
</P>
<P>
   Once again Woodbridge Mayor Jim McGreevey will likely be the
Democratic challenger. McGreevey thwarted a primary challenge from
U.S. Sen. Robert Torricelli.
</P>
<P>
   That battle grabbed attention, and possibly pushed McGreevey
into the public mind nearly a year before the gubernatorial primary
in June 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''Democrats have momentum in New Jersey and McGreevey can
piggyback on Gore and Lieberman,'' Rider University political
science professor David Rebovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans see that, he said. To pre-empt McGreevey and his
family-friendly agenda, Republicans are moving forward with plans
that get beyond tax cuts, Rebovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment and crime statistics are low. The economy is riding
high. Republicans in the Statehouse need to be seen doing more than
just helping the upper middle class, Rebovich said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do these good Republican numbers translate into electoral
success in 2001? Probably not unless Republicans get ahead and onto
these other important issues that people see as affecting them,''
Rebovich said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest boost to a GOP candidate could be the current
Republican governor.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman this week outlined her plans for health care
legislation, a proposal in her word that ''dovetailed'' with
DiFrancesco's offering.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman also wants her plan made into law by the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''It helps a lot. It will help her with her last year. These
will be things she can point to as her legacy,'' DiFrancesco said.
</P>
<P>
   ''She has that last say unless she supports that. Regardless of
what we say, she has the last say when she signs the bill. She can
point to it as hers and we can point to it as well. It helps.''

<HEADLINE> Georgia Pacific showing 10 mills to prospective buyers  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN BACHMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) - Georgia-Pacific Corp. has told about 2,700
employees at 10 paper mills that it plans to sell those plants and
has begun offering potential buyers tours of the facilities, as
part of the company's massive restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials began notifying the employees in eight states
last week about the tours, but stressed that it has accepted no
offers for any of the properties, company spokesman Ken Haldin said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had discussions with potential buyers, but we have not
yet made any final decisions,'' Haldin said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific, which makes Angel Soft bathroom tissue and
Sparkle paper towels, announced July 17 that it will buy
Illinois-based Fort James Corp. in a $7.8 billion merger that would
create the world's largest paper-products manufacturer.
Georgia-Pacific also would assume about $3.5 billion in Fort James
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Fort James makes brands such as Quilted Northern, Soft 'N
Gentle, Vanity Fair, Dixie, Brawny and Mardi Gras.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Georgia-Pacific said it would divest
250,000 tons of production capacity throughout its extensive,
80-plant pulp and paper-products manufacturing system, as well as
other ''non-strategic businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after the Fort James announcement, Georgia-Pacific sold
its timber business to a Seattle-based real estate investment trust
for $3 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The plants for sale are three pulp mills in Brunswick, Ga., New
Augusta, Miss., and Baileyville, Maine; as well as seven tissue
production plants in Alsip, Ill; Brattleboro, Vt.; LaGrange, Ga.;
Flagstaff, Ariz.; Gary, Ind.; Greenwich and Plattsburgh, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, the plants employ 2,715 workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a major transformation underway at the company,
transferring our portfolio of assets to focus on higher-margin
business that focus on the customer,'' Haldin said.
</P>
<P>
   Some employees at Georgia-Pacific's tissue plant in LaGrange
have expressed concern for their jobs if the operation is sold, but
company officials have told workers they expect the plants won't be
closed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just someone else's paycheck,'' said John Hodges, manager
of the LaGrange, Ga. plant, which will be toured Friday by a
potential buyer. He declined to reveal who has expressed interest
in buying the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific employs about 2,000 people at its three
Baileyville, Maine properties. Besides the pulp mill, the company
has two wood-products operations which are not currently for sale,
Haldin said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Georgia-Pacific told employees at the Plattsburgh
plant that negotiations have begun with a potential buyer. That has
made many workers ''very uncomfortable,'' said Timothy Barnard,
president of Paper Allied Chemical and Energy Local 387, which
represents about 350 plant employees.
</P>
<P>
   The plant is Plattsburgh's second-largest employer, with a
payroll of about $25 million, the Albany Times Union reported.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers say if DEP does not change sewer rules, they will  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Lawmakers of both parties said Wednesday
they would use the Legislature's oversight power to nullify sewer
regulations that environmental groups fear will permit too much
sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial regulations, which are in a review phase,
would change how development is managed by taking into account the
health of waterways. In the past, most attention was paid only to
sewage treatment capacity.
</P>
<P>
   But groups like the Sierra Club have condemned the proposed
rules as too loose by failing to place limits on sewer plant
expansion, which in turn paves the way for more housing. They also
say too little emphasis is paid to improving polluted waterways.
</P>
<P>
   Builders have complained about the rules as well, claiming that
new requirements to prevent too much rainwater runoff would add too
much to the cost of homes.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Legislature has the authority to pass resolutions
unilaterally that nullify or rewrite the regulations imposed by
state agencies if lawmakers conclude the agencies were not being
faithful to bills they passed.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Leonard Lance, R-Hunterdon, chairman of the Assembly
Budget Committee, called on the state Department of Environmental
Protection to revise the sewer rules to make sure water pollution
is reduced.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, if the DEP fails in this regard, I am confident that
the Assembly will move aggressively forward to override this
rule,'' Lance said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a news release, Sen. John Matheussen, R-Gloucester,
chairman of the Senate's oversight committee, promised prompt
action if the DEP does not change the proposal on its own.

<P>
	   VOORHEESVILLE, N.Y. (AP) - Friends of a 14-year-old killed by a
train Wednesday morning said he may have been playing a game of
dare.
</P>
<P>
   Albany County police said Matthew J. Savoie of Slingerlands
acknowledged the CSX train was approaching, even making eye contact
with the conductor, yet remained on the train tracks.
</P>
<P>
   He was hit by the v-shaped cowcatcher on the front of the train
and thrown some 30 feet with such force his shoes were knocked off.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he was probably trying to see how close the train
would come before he jumped off,'' said Chad Puglia, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   CSX officials called the incident a ''senseless'' reminder that
people should not be on or near railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The Albany County Sheriff's Department, along with CSX Corp.,
are continuing the investigation.

<HEADLINE> State police take aim at I-95  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - With accidents up nearly 10 percent and
complaints from drivers reaching a ''crescendo,'' state police on
Wednesday promised a tough new crackdown on aggressive drivers on
I-95 in Fairfield County.
</P>
<P>
   Public Safety Commissioner Arthur Spada said traffic enforcement
in recent years has become ''a neglected stepchild'' as state
police have focused many of their resources on gangs and narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   Spada said state police cannot reconfigure I-95 to make it safer
or reduce the heavy volume of traffic, but can deter aggressive
driving by having a ''plethora'' of state police cruisers on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will stay as long as necessary to reduce the mayhem on our
highways,'' Spada said at a news conference at the Troop G state
police barracks in Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown, dubbed ''Operation Putnam,'' or Patrol Uniform
Troopers Noticing Aggressive Motorists, will target I-95 drivers
from Greenwich to Bridgeport. Motorists who speed, make erratic
lane changes, follow too closely or commit other reckless driving
acts will be targeted and given summonses, Spada said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, state police have four patrols per shift on the
Greenwich to Bridgeport stretch of I-95, plus another two during
peak traffic hours.
</P>
<P>
   Under Operation Putnam, they will post three cruisers on spots
along the highway in Stamford, Norwalk and Bridgeport during peak
hours. They also plan to have three or four additional troopers
patrolling that stretch of highway at any given time, said Major
Edward J. Lynch, commanding officer of the Western District of the
state police.
</P>
<P>
   State police said accidents have increased 9.5 percent on I-95
in Fairfield County in one year. In 1998, state police investigated
3,132 accidents. In 1999, that number jumped to 3,429.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic volume on the highway has increased dramatically in the
last decade. State police provided figures that show daily traffic
volume on I-95 in Norwalk, traveling eastbound and westbound, has
grown from 113,000 cars per day in 1990 to 134,000 per day in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   I-95 is heavily traveled by Connecticut-New York commuters,
shoreline visitors and vacationers traveling along the Boston-New
York corridor.
</P>
<P>
   Spada drew chuckles from the assorted state police and state
representatives assembled at the news conference when he made a
veiled reference to a traffic stop he made himself.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Spada ordered his state police driver to pull over a
car from Massachusetts when it sped past them on Interstate 91,
just north of Middletown.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be substance to this campaign, even if I have to be
on the highway myself,'' Spada said.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Putnam is similar to two other crackdowns done in
Windham and New London counties.
</P>
<P>
   The new program is named after General Israel Putnam, a
Revolutionary War general who stemmed the British advance into
Greenwich.

<HEADLINE> Changing demographics are potential pitfall for future politicians  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE WATSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Politicians seeking future office may find that
the melting pot known as New York City's diverse population might
burn them if they're not careful.
</P>
<P>
   Experts and political junkies say statistical data released
Wednesday by the U.S. Census Bureau show that politicians must mix
the needs of not only whites and blacks, but Hispanics and Asians.
They had better, they say, because the voices of the groups that
once were the minority are getting stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, the number of non-Hispanic whites living in New York
has fallen about 12 percent, while Hispanic and Asian populations
rose steadily. Hispanics have passed the black population, which
has remained roughly stable, to become the city's largest minority
group.
</P>
<P>
   The population estimates are based on births, deaths and
migration. The numbers are separate from Census 2000 data, which is
not yet available.
</P>
<P>
   ''The job of a politician in New York is more complex, and
because of that you can't just represent one group,'' said Prof.
Mitchell Moss, director of New York University's Taub Urban
Research Center. ''No way does a politician get elected unless they
are able to forge alliances between the groups.''
</P>
<P>
   The changing face of New York's 7.4 million population is
similar to trends found throughout the United States. It's just
happening faster in New York than everywhere else, other than in
California where whites are no longer the majority.
</P>
<P>
   Considering demographic projections, New York is headed the same
way. In 1999, there were about 2.1 million Hispanics in the city, a
16 percent increase since 1990. They made up about 28 percent of
the city population. The Hispanic population has grown steadily
each year in all five boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Hispanics will elect more public officials and probably a
mayor in the not-too-distant future,'' said former Mayor Ed Koch,
who said he foresees State Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez as the best
bet. But Koch wouldn't discount Bronx Borough President Fernando
Ferrer in the 2001 mayoral election, even though Koch backs City
Council Speaker Peter Vallone.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Koch said he's already finding elected leaders are
acting differently, noting, ''You see more judges appointed who are
black and Hispanic.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's Asian residents are expected to eventually be another
force in New York politics. There are about 700,000 Asians in the
city, an increase of 200,000, or 40 percent, since 1990. Asians
made up about 9 percent of the city's 1999 population. Like
Hispanics, the increases were significant in all five boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   That's in stark contrast to whites, whose population fell in
each borough other than Staten Island. Whites make up about 37
percent of the city's 1999 population, just over 2.7 million
people. Black populations, amounting to about 1.8 million people,
declined in the Bronx and Brooklyn, but grew slightly in Manhattan,
Queens and Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   The data doesn't surprise most demographers, who've watched the
trend actually stretch back to the early 1980s. The population of
white residents has fallen through the years - seen as far back as
the 1970s when the term ''white flight'' was first penned after
700,000 fled the city seeking refuge in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, immigrants from across the globe have surged into New
York. About 970,000 immigrants have come to the city since 1990,
said Joseph Salvo, the director of the population division for the
Department of City Planning.
</P>
<P>
   For years, it was Eastern Europeans and people from Central and
South America. More recently, those numbers have been boosted by
Chinese, immigrants from the former Soviet Union, and the West
Indies, Salvo said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's really amazing is we don't get immigrants from one part
of the world,'' Moss said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Study: Dirty Air Affecting Parks  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The growing problem of dirty air over national
parks is disappointing tourists and keeping some away, costing
nearby businesses millions of dollars in lost revenue, concludes a
study commissioned by several environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   Pollution from coal-burning power plants, cars and factories
often drifts hundreds of miles causing serious haze problems in
otherwise remote and pristine parks and forest areas, a variety of
studies have determined in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In the East, places like the Great Smoky Mountains and
Shenandoah national parks have had summer-time visibility reduced
dramatically because of severe haze caused by man-made pollution
from sources miles away. Some parts in the West have seen
visibility plummet from 140 miles to 35 miles on some summer days.
</P>
<P>
   But the findings by Abt Associates Inc., an environmental
research firm in Bethesda, Md., sought to examine the economic
impact of dirty air and poor visibility in parks.
</P>
<P>
   The study acknowledges that its findings are ''very rough
estimates of economic benefit'' because it is ''difficult'' to
measure what visibility is worth to the public. Still, the report
assumes that cleaner air would bring additional people to the parks
-- based on the fact that surveys have shown that clean air and
unobstructed views are a top priority of park visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ''When confronted by poor visibility... travelers shorten their
stay or go elsewhere,'' said the study.
</P>
<P>
   Examining seven national parks which pollution problems, the
study estimated that a 25 percent increase in visitors would
translate into an additional $13 million to nearly $300 million in
additional economic benefits to local businesses, depending on the
park -- as well as increased fees for the park.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've known for years that hazy skies in our national parks
disappoint tourists and local residents alike,'' said Angela
Ledford of the National Campaign Against Dirty Power, one of the
environmental groups that commissioned the study. ''Now we know
that cleaning up the pollution that cause haze will pump millions
into the local and national economies.''
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency last year issued regulations
requiring that visibility at 156 national parks be improved by 15
percent each decade, returning to pristine conditions over a
60-year period. The agency is expected to issue new requirements on
pollution controls to meet those goals later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The study examined haze and visitor statistics at Acadia
National Park in Maine; Big Bend National Park in Texas; Grand
Canyon National Park in Arizona; Great Smoky Mountains National
Park in Tennessee and North Carolina; Indiana Dunes National
Lakeshore in Indiana; Mount Rainier National Park in Washington;
and Shenandoah National Park in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Other environmental groups involved in the report are the Clean
Air Task Force, National Environmental Trust, and the U.S. Public
Interest Research Group.

<HEADLINE> Wife: Lane Hit, Choked Me  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Fred Lane's wife told a 911 operator that
her husband choked and hit her and said her baby wasn't his child
before she fatally shot the NFL running back in their home,
according to a police recording released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-minute tape of the July 6 telephone conversation between
Deidra Lane and the operator was released by Charlotte-Mecklenburg
police one week after murder charges were filed against her in her
husband's death.
</P>
<P>
   Deidra Lane told an operator that she shot her husband twice,
minutes after he walked through the door of their suburban
Charlotte home, according to tapes released to the Charlotte
Observer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was standing here and he came in. I just had the baby seven
days ago,'' Lane says on the tape, screaming and sobbing. ''And he
came in and he started choking me. He was like, 'That baby's not
mine.' He started hitting me. He just got shot because he wouldn't
leave me alone. I kept telling him to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Deidra Lane, 25, turned herself in to police Aug. 23. She is
free on $100,000 bond while she awaits a murder trial in the death
of the former Carolina Panthers player. She could receive life in
prison or the death penalty if convicted of first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   Police had been fighting a judge's order to release the tape to
the media, but they decided to make it public Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought it was just time,'' police attorney Mark Newbold
told the Observer, declining to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Deidra Lane's attorney, Henderson Hill, and Mecklenburg County
Assistant District Attorney Marsha Goodenow, who is prosecuting the
case, both declined comment on the tape.
</P>
<P>
   The tape covered the time from when she called 911 until police
were inside her home. After she spoke with the 911 operator, Deidra
Lane spent several hours giving police a voluntary statement about
the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The 911 operator on the tape repeatedly tells a hysterical
Deidra Lane to take a deep breath, calm down and tell her what
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I shot him in the chest or stomach and I think I just
shot him again. I don't know. Please send somebody. There is blood
everywhere. There is blood all over me.''
</P>
<P>
   The operator asks if he is breathing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know. I didn't go near him,'' she responds. ''I'm
sorry Pilarr. ... I'm sorry,'' she says, speaking to her baby, born
a week before the shooting. She told the operator that she's
nursing the baby.
</P>
<P>
   Later, she told the operator: ''He just walked in the door like
two or three or four minutes ago. He wasn't even here that long. I
was just coming back from the kitchen and he just said, 'Someone
told me that's not my baby.' I don't even know if he dropped his
luggage or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said last week during a bond hearing that Deidra
Lane shot her husband to collect on a $5 million life insurance
policy. They said Deidra Lane of walking through her husband's
blood on the floor, putting the shotgun to the back of his head and
firing again.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Henderson Hill said after the hearing Deidra
Lane will present a much different picture of the facts at trial.
</P>
<P>
   On the 911 tape, she says, ''I was so scared, I just shot him
again.''
</P>
<P>
   She also tells the operator her husband had assaulted her
before.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was in the paper once, but I denied it. I mean I didn't
really tell my friends know. But I was so embarrassed because of
who he is,'' she said. ''He always told me if I ever told anybody,
he'd make it worse and I'd ruin his career.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, Deidra Lane filed a domestic violence complaint
against Fred Lane, accusing her husband of snatching a necklace
from her neck during an argument. But she later said her husband
''never put his hands on me.''

<HEADLINE> BCA Classic Makeup Date Proposed  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Black Coaches Association Classic, postponed
Sunday night by heavy rains and severe lightning, might be played
Dec. 1 at Virginia Tech. If so, the Hokies will have to face a
different opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech said Wednesday that it won't take part in a makeup
game against the No. 11 Hokies.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic director Dave Braine said the Yellow Jackets only
wanted to play a 12th game if it came at the beginning of the
season. They had no desire to play Virginia Tech at the end of the
regular season, a week after meeting rival Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did not play the game for money,'' Braine said. ''We end up
losing money, but we're doing what we think is best for our kids.
To bring them in a week early to prepare for this game, then ask
them to practice an additional week after the Georgia game, is not
fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech's decision sparked an angry reaction from the BCA.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Black Coaches Association is very disappointed and
frustrated by Georgia Tech's decision,'' said Bob Minnix, incoming
president of the BCA. ''We expected to raise approximately $300,000
from the BCA bowl to help promote our mission of assisting minority
coaches and athletic administrators. We expected all parties to act
in good faith to reschedule this game for Dec. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech athletic director Jim Weaver said his school had
no hard feelings toward Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ''We certainly understand that they have certain issues they're
dealing with,'' Weaver said. ''We're dealing with a different set
of issues. One of those issues is the fact that probably 53,000 of
the 56,000 fans at the game are Virginia Tech fans.''
</P>
<P>
   The BCA said an alternate opponent was being sought, but Weaver
said he's not sure Virginia Tech would be willing to play another
school. He planned to discuss the issue Thursday with coach Frank
Beamer.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not been our interest. Our interest has been in playing
Georgia Tech,'' said Weaver, adding that he's not even sure it
would be possible to line up another opponent on such short notice.
''We'll take a step back, look at the whole situation and see where
we are.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, college football schedules are set up years
in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech had no contractual obligation to reschedule the
game but did offer to return to Blacksburg, Va., at the beginning
of the 2001 season for a replay, according to Braine.
</P>
<P>
   ''We tried to make a good-faith effort to fulfill our commitment
of playing the game,'' Braine said. ''The ACC offered to help get
an exemption so the BCA could have two games next year. Virginia
Tech was in favor of doing that also, but it was my understanding
that ESPN was not in favor of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN or its sister network, ESPN2, have agreed to televise a
rescheduled game. But they probably wouldn't be interested in
televising a Virginia Tech-Georgia Tech matchup next year if the
Hokies super sophomore, Michael Vick, turns pro after this season --
a definite possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech coach George O'Leary, whose team is preparing for
Saturday's new opener against Central Florida, said he agreed with
the administration's decision not to replay the game at the end of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were three reasons why I wanted to play the game to
start with,'' he said. ''One was to set the barometer for our team
over the offseason and the summer. Two, we have an inexperienced
quarterback (George Godsey), and I wanted to get him in an early
game. Three, I just like early season games. Now, all three of
those reasons are no longer valid.''
</P>
<P>
   Godsey is replacing Heisman Trophy runner-up Joe Hamilton, who
led the Yellow Jackets to three straight bowl games.
</P>
<P>
   Braine said there were two scenarios to consider if the game was
played Dec. 1 -- neither favorable to Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ''One, we beat Georgia. What a way to end the year. Do you think
we could really get ready to go back to Blacksburg to play?'' he
asked. ''What if we get beat by Georgia and are not going to a bowl
game because we're 4-7. Do you think we could get ready to go back
to Blacksburg and play? No way, either way.''
</P>
<P>
   The stormy weather arrived in Blacksburg just as the Hokies were
getting set to kick off to Georgia Tech on Sunday night. Severe
lightning forced the players off the field. Within 30 minutes, the
field had puddles in many places from the heavy rains, and Virginia
Tech's sideline was a virtual quagmire. After an hour, officials
decided to call the game off.
</P>
<P>
   ''We fulfilled our obligation. We lined up to kick the game off.
Then a higher power told us not to play the game,'' said Braine, a
former athletic director at Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to lose friends on this deal, no question. But
you've got to separate all the other things. There are a lot of
folks who probably believe this is not the right thing to do, but I
do believe it is the right thing to do.''

<HEADLINE> Cuba: US Tries to Paw Immigration  </HEADLINE>
By MARK STEVENSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba on Wednesday dismissed a U.S. diplomatic
protest over cases of Cubans blocked from leaving the island and
charged the United States with manipulating immigration issues for
political gain during an election year.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the U.S. protest involved just 117 people -- out of
nearly 20,000 visas granted annually -- the Cuban Foreign Ministry
in a written statement called the U.S. protests ''a publicity
maneuver, suspiciously timed to coincide with visits to Miami by
presidential candidates'' Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The statement suggested that this year's spat was motivated by
the candidates' ''competition for funds and support'' from the
Cuban exile community in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between the two countries rose after Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright accused Cuba on Monday of arbitrarily denying
exit permits to Cubans with U.S. visas, thereby separating families
and forcing would-be immigrants to attempt high-risk escapes by
boat.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba, in turn, has accused Washington of luring Cubans to risk
their lives making the dangerous 90-mile crossing to Florida, by
promising automatic residency for any Cuban who makes it ashore.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba has suggested the U.S. policy is designed to make the
immigrants look like political refugees, when in fact such a policy
-- if extended to other Latin American nations -- would draw waves of
economic refugees from throughout the regions.
</P>
<P>
   The statement defended what it called the relatively few cases --
mainly involving doctors or relatives of dissidents -- in which Cuba
has refused to allow those with U.S. visas to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States' practice of trying to steal qualified
personal, trained for free from kindergarten, from an
underdeveloped country is shameful,'' the statement continued.
</P>
<P>
   As for dissidents and their families, Cuba said they would not
be given preference in immigration.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute follows a protracted and touchy U.S. dispute with
Cuban Americans over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was spirited from Cuba by his mother, who died at sea,
and taken home by his father after a lengthy legal battle with
emigre relatives in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government cited the incident in June when it asked
for a postponement of immigration talks with the United States --
but has since said it is ready to restart the negotiations, but
that the U.S. government hasn't proposed a date.

<HEADLINE> Charles Atlas finds no humor in DC Comics parody of an Atlas man  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Flexing its legal muscle, DC Comics managed to
knock out of court a lawsuit Charles Atlas Limited filed after the
comic book transformed the beachside muscleman hero into a bullying
brute.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald in a ruling filed
Tuesday declared DC Comics the winner in the legal dispute,
dismissing the lawsuit largely on First Amendment grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is precisely the type of expression of ideas that the
First Amendment is designed to protect,'' Buchwald wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Atlas Limited filed the lawsuit last year after learning
about the parody by DC Comics of a comic strip advertisement Atlas
used to promote its body building classes.
</P>
<P>
   In the Atlas comic strip titled, ''The Insult that Made a Man
out of Mac,'' a bully kicks sand in scrawny Mac's face at the
beach, causing him to take the Atlas course and develop a muscular
physique. Mac then finds the bully on the beach and punches him as
he receives newfound respect from a female companion and a halo of
sorts forms over his head.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the story in the 1991 DC Comics spoof of the
advertisement remains the same until a character similar to Mac but
named ''Flex Mentallo'' returns to the beach. There, Flex beats up
the woman with him by smashing her in the face and saying, ''I
don't need a tramp like you anymore!'' the judge recounted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here, DC's Flex Mentallo comic books imitate plaintiff's comic
ad and take it to an absurd conclusion,'' the judge said. ''It is
an undeniable twist on plaintiff's comic ad for the once-weak
character to gain strength only to himself become a brute and a
bully.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge added, ''In effect, the character Flex Mentallo is a
farcical commentary on plaintiff's implied promises of physical and
sexual prowess through use of the Atlas method.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was criticized by Jeffrey C. Hogue, president of
Charles Atlas Limited, which has executive offices in Harrington
Park, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think sometimes courts make mistakes. This was one of them.
There has to be a limit to how far you can let someone ridicule
your trademark,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They took that character and made him into something that was
not an Atlas man,'' Hogue said. ''We've always stood up for the
underdog. If anyone was beating a woman, we'd be the one stopping
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lillian Laserson, a lawyer for DC Comics, said the company
''certainly meant no harm to the Charles Atlas company.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Comic books are an important part of American culture and we
are very happy that Judge Buchwald recognized that they are
entitled to First Amendment protection,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> BoSox's Daubach Injured in Brawl  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Brian Daubach hyperextended his left
elbow during a brawl between the Red Sox and Tampa Bay Devil Rays
and flew to Boston for more tests that could determine how long he
might be out of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a fracture. That's all I know,'' the first baseman
said Wednesday before leaving the visiting clubhouse at Tropicana
Field, where the Red Sox concluded a three-game series. ''I don't
have anything to say today. I'll talk to you guys in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Daubach was injured Tuesday night when he entered a pile of
players during a bench-clearing brawl that broke out after Pedro
Martinez hit leadoff man Gerald Williams with his fourth pitch of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how Daubach was hurt, but the Devil Rays
complained that he threw some cheap shots during the scuffle and
targeted him for retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay starter Dave Eiland was ejected in the third inning
for hitting Daubach and Nomar Garciaparra. Relievers Cory Lidle and
Tony Fiore were tossed during the first baseman's at bat in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Lidle threw behind Daubach. Fiore threw inside on his first
pitch, then hit him with his second.
</P>
<P>
   ''For some unknown reason they singled out Daubach. I don't know
why they would do that. He just came in the pile to break it up,''
said third baseman Lou Merloni, who was hospitalized overnight
after sustaining a mild concussion during a pileup.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got a guy charging Pedro Martinez. You do everything
you possibly can to prevent them. He just came in to try to get him
out of it. ... I didn't see any cheap shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Merloni also missed Wednesday's game, but hopes to return to the
lineup Friday when the Red Sox open a weekend series against
Seattle at Fenway Park. He said he had a headache and stiff neck,
but was more concerned about the affect losing Daubach would have
on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach, whose status is day to day, is hitting .262 with 20
homers and 71 RBIs. He has hit safely in 11 of his last 14 games,
batting .346 during the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is we've got a very important part of our team
that could be out for a while,'' Merloni said. ''The bottom line is
the club's losing out on something that never should have happened
in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight Devil Rays, including manager Larry Rothschild, two
coaches and five players, were ejected in the first seven innings
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Chuck LaMar said videotape showing several
different angles of the first-inning brawl had been shipped to
Frank Robinson, baseball's disciplinarian, adding that the club
didn't feel Daubach handled himself in a ''professional'' manner.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Daubach doesn't jump in, nothing happens,'' said first base
coach Jose Cardenal, one of the Devil Rays ejected.

<HEADLINE> L.L. Bean To Pay For Recall Delay  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Retailer L.L. Bean has agreed to pay a
$750,000 civil penalty to settle allegations it violated federal
law in delaying a report that two of its backpack child carriers
were defective and have caused injuries, the government said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission alleges that L.L.
Bean, Inc. of Freeport, Maine, delayed in reporting that children
can work their way out of the harness and fall through a leg
opening or topple out of the top of the carriers. L.L. Bean knew of
39 incidents involving the two carriers before reporting the
defect, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   One child suffered a concussion and fractured wrist in a fall
from the backpack, and six children suffered contusions,
lacerations, bumps or bruises. Also, four children became entangled
in the carrier's shoulder straps, creating a risk of strangulation.
</P>
<P>
   The model number W695 backpack child carrier is teal green with
gray harnesses and a kickstand. The company sold about 13,000 of
these carriers for about $95 from January 1993 through March 1995,
and recalled them in April 1999. The model number AC25 carrier is
forest green and has gray harnesses with a kickstand. L.L. Bean
sold about 11,800 AC25 carriers for about $95 from January 1997
through October 1998, and recalled them in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Both carriers were sold through the company's Web site, in
catalogs and at retail stories in Maine, Oregon, New Hampshire and
Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   In agreeing to pay the civil penalty, L.L. Bean denied that it
violated the Consumer Product Safety Act or any other law.
</P>
<P>
   L.L. Bean characterized the delay as a misunderstanding of the
commission's rules. The company did not fight the fine because it
agrees with the commission's goal to reduce risk to children,
spokeswoman Mary Rose MacKinnon said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The company initially thought some customers may have been using
the backpacks improperly because company product testers did not
experience any problems, MacKinnon said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said consumers who have either of these carriers
should stop using them immediately and contact L.L. Bean at
1-800-555-9717 or visit the company's Web site at
www.llbean.com/recall for return and refund information.

<HEADLINE> Civilians Caught in Colombia's War  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW SELSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NELSON MANDELA BARRIO, Colombia (AP) -- By the thousands,
civilians caught in Colombia's war have been fleeing their villages
and winding up in huge squatter camps like Nelson Mandela Barrio,
outside Cartagena.
</P>
<P>
   It is a sight President Clinton isn't seeing Wednesday during
his visit to the charming Spanish-colonial city of nearby
Cartagena: children walking barefoot in the mud past ramshackle
huts, their bellies distended from malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
   The squalid scene underscores the desperation millions of
Colombian civilians face as the war widens and opposing sides gain
strength.
</P>
<P>
   While leftist guerrillas and rival right-wing paramilitary
groups have gotten stronger by profiting from the narcotics trade,
government security forces are receiving a huge injection of aid
from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups say civilians are being abused by all sides
-- which is apparent in listening to the horrific experiences of
residents of Nelson Mandela Barrio, or neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ''A group of 10 armed men entered my house, tied us up and
dragged away my son,'' said Juan de Dios Llorente in an interview
in his hut, made of burlap sacks strung along branches and
furnished only with two hammocks.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen were members of the country's biggest rebel group,
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, de Dios Llorente said,
and they accused his son of being an informant for the army.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, a friend told de Dios Llorente that his son's
body was on a nearby farm. De Dios Llorente retrieved the body. He
had been shot three times in the back of the head.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the climate of fear among Colombia's war victims that de
Dios Llorente would only tell his story in the relative privacy of
his shelter.
</P>
<P>
   So far, death squads have not come to Nelson Mandela Barrio,
many of whose residents are black and who respect the South African
leader for his fight to free blacks from apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   The squatter camp, located in a hilly green area a few miles
outside Cartagena, is only five years old but already holds 45,000
people. Some 95 percent have been displaced by the war, aid workers
say.
</P>
<P>
   There is no system to care for the war refugees, and most are
left to find food and shelter on their own. Only the most
malnourished children are fed by humanitarian organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is mirrored throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 2 million Colombians have fled their homes over the past
15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The number of displaced people is growing annually -- last year
alone, 288,000 people were displaced, according to a private
monitoring group, the Consultancy for Human Rights and
Displacement.
</P>
<P>
   Another 148,000 fled during the first six months of this year,
the group reported, and officials say as many as 40,000
coca-growing farmers could be uprooted when a U.S.-backed anti-drug
offensive gets underway in southern Colombia next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Rome-based World Food Program on Wednesday called for more
aid for Colombia's displaced, saying an appeal for $9 million worth
of aid has only resulted in about one quarter of the assistance
required.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the war refugees sought out President Clinton in
Cartagena on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ruby Arroyo, 29, spent more than eight hours in Cartagena hoping
to pass Clinton a letter in which she beseeched his help for her
family.
</P>
<P>
   ''Two years ago, the war between paramilitaries and rebels cost
the lives of humble campesinos who were brutally killed and their
humble homes destroyed and burned,'' the letter said. ''Terror
overcame us and we had to flee to save our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Arroyo's six siblings and two elderly parents, who had been
rural farmers, now sell goods on the street, work as maids and take
other menial labor. ''Sir, we need your help,'' the letter added.
</P>
<P>
   Benigna Blanco left her village of Maria la Baja two months ago,
joining dozens of her neighbors in the northern town who had fled
in previous months.
</P>
<P>
   She finally joined the stream of refugees because her six
children, the youngest eight years old, were becoming traumatized.
</P>
<P>
   ''Paramilitaries would come at night with lists of names in
their hands and shoot people in their homes,'' Blanco said.
</P>
<P>
   Misael Munoz, 34, surveyed the expanding Nelson Mandela Barrio,
ankle deep in mud after a torrential rain.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz left his hometown of Santa Marta along the Caribbean coast
two months ago after heavily armed men stormed into a neighbor's
house and shot three people dead.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know who the killers were, but even if I did I would
not say,'' Munoz said. ''I'm still very unnerved by what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Munoz has now uprooted his whole life. As men nearby banged
branches together with hammers to create frames for their shacks,
he considered his situation. As grim as it was, he was alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is better to be here in the mud than in a pretty casket,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   De Dios Llorente, meanwhile, prays that eventually his village
of Curulao will become safe enough for him to return.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want peace,'' he said. ''It's the only thing I want.
Peace.''

<HEADLINE> UN Inspector: Ready To Work in Iraq  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The chief U.N. weapons inspector for Iraq
said Wednesday he was ready to send teams to Baghdad to start up
new arms searches -- despite the flat refusal by Iraqi authorities
to allow inspectors in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Blix, executive chairman of the U.N. Monitoring,
Verification and Inspection Commission, said in a report that his
new agency had hired the core staff and recruited and trained the
required inspectors needed to deploy teams.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, he said, ''could plan and commence a number of
activities in Iraq which would be necessary to prepare for
monitoring, verification and inspection envisaged by the Security
Council.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz made clear
that Iraq would not allow a new weapons inspection team to enter
Iraq and said the country remained firm in its refusal to cooperate
with the Security Council resolution that established the new
inspection agency.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, known as UNMOVIC, was created in December to replace
the U.N. Special Commission, which oversaw the destruction of
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction in the aftermath of the 1991
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors from the Special Commission left Iraq in December
1998 ahead of U.S. and British airstrikes, launched to punish Iraq
for failing to cooperate with arms searches. Iraq has barred any
U.N. inspectors from returning.
</P>
<P>
   Blix also reported on a recent meeting of his advisory panel in
which commissioners discussed the inspection of so-called
''sensitive sites,'' in Iraq. Inspections on such sites led to a
crisis in arms searches two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some commissioners called for guildelines and operating
procedures for the controversial searches of presidential palaces
and other sensitive areas, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Many Reasons To Deal Kemp for Cavs  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Shawn Kemp's waistline and contract both got
too big for the Cleveland Cavaliers -- that's why he was sent to
Portland on Wednesday in a three-way trade.
</P>
<P>
   One other factor: Kemp wanted out of Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was looking to hopefully go somewhere else,'' Cavs general
manager Jim Paxson said at a news conference. ''And that was made
very clear to us last spring.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Cavs made it very clear to Kemp that they're not going
to cry now that he's gone.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for Kemp, a six-time All-Star coming off his worst
pro season, the Cavs got forwards Clarence Weatherspoon and Chris
Gatling plus a future first-round draft pick and cash from Miami.
They also got 36-year-old guard Gary Grant from Portland.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers re-signed free agent forward Brian Grant and sent
him to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the short term we have depth, we have a lot of players
fighting for time and positions,'' Paxson said. ''In the long term,
we have some flexibility that could create a chance to be able to
improve the roster.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal was finalized a few weeks ago, but under league rules
the teams were prohibited from announcing the package until the end
of the month because Gatling had been traded within the past 60
days. Also, Portland president Bob Whitsitt was out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp, who signed a seven-year, $98 million contract after coming
to the Cavs in a three-way trade in 1997, will join a Blazers' team
that nearly beat the eventual NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers in
the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers are hoping a return to the Pacific Northwest will
motivate Kemp, who began his career in Seattle where he worked with
Whitsitt.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp had a great first year for Cleveland -- he was an All-Star --
and was selected to the Cavaliers' 30th anniversary team. But he
has reported to training camp 50 pounds overweight the past two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The added weight grounded Kemp, who used to be one of the most
ferocious dunkers in the league. Too often last season he was
forced to adjust his shot or just had it blocked. He finished the
season averaging 17.8 points -- his lowest total since 1992-93-- and
with a career-low 41.7 field-goal percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp was also a liability on the defensive end, leading the
league in personal fouls and finishing third in turnovers -- a
remarkable stat for a frontline player.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old was a bigger headache off the court. He
regularly arrived late for home games, team meetings and flights,
failing to be the type of role model the Cavs wanted for their
young players.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a coach it's tough for me to see a guy leave who gave me 18
points and eight rebounds,'' Cavs coach Randy Wittman said. ''But
on my team, my best players have to be players that the other
people look up to and want to follow and emulate, and that didn't
always happen.''
</P>
<P>
   After the season ended, Kemp promised the Cavs that he would not
only work hard during this off-season, but that he would stay in
contact with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ''We never heard from him,'' said Wittman, who estimated the
club unsuccessfully tried to call Kemp 25-30 times. ''But it wasn't
uncommon at his other stops. A lot of things that went on here went
on in Seattle. I had a whole thing mapped out for him and it wasn't
able to be used.''
</P>
<P>
   Wittman said he wasn't sure if Kemp could ever shed the weight
and become a dominating player again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to say he won't,'' Wittman said. ''But the
weight affected his play last year. His ability to really explode
to the basket was hurt. The shots that he was getting blocked were
baskets for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Paxson and Wittman stressed that there were a lot of reasons the
Cavs dealt their only big-name player.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whenever you're considering trading, every factor comes into
it. To say strictly done for financial reasons, no. Strictly done
for the weight reasons -- everything factors in,'' Paxson said.
</P>
<P>
   After the season, Kemp asked the Cavs to see if they could work
out a trade. The prospects seemed slim since Kemp's contract calls
for him to make $71 million over the next four years, including
$46.5 million in the final two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It strictly wasn't just a money issue, but at the same time,
because of the back end of his contract, the flexibility of being
able to do anything to improve this team was greatly limited,''
Paxson said.
</P>
<P>
   Money isn't an issue for the Blazers with owner Paul Allen's
money and a burning desire to win an NBA title.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Partner Rolled Out  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Logictier Inc. of San Mateo, Calif., will
power a high-traffic Internet Web site for Utah's 2002 Winter
Games.
</P>
<P>
   The technology partner fills a new category of Olympic
sponsorship and was announced Wednesday by Mitt Romney, president
of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Logictier will provide computer servers and other equipment
needed to keep up with 30 million people who are expected to browse
the Web site or order tickets or merchandise. Salt Lake expects 23
times as many visitors on its Web site as the 1998 Nagano Games
had.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our business focus is providing Internet operations management
suitable for the world's most active and complex sites,'' said Mary
Ann Byrnes, president and CEO of Logictier, a company formed in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Logictier became a sponsor and supplier for the U.S. and Salt
Lake Olympic committees. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed, but
sponsors provide $20 million and suppliers generally $5 million to
$10 million worth of cash, services or products.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes two weeks after the Salt Lake Organizing
Committee selected NBC/Quokka Ventures to provide multimedia
content for the 2002 Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Winter Games organizers and NBC will merge their Olympic Web
sites next year at www.olympics.com, currently the home page for
September's Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers can be directed to the same place by typing
NBCOlympics.com, saltlake2002.com or olympics.com.
</P>
<P>
   NBC paid $545 million for the U.S. rights to broadcast the 2002
Games, part of a multibillion-dollar contract with the
International Olympic Committee for the same rights to every
Olympics through 2008.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Brings Aid To Colombia  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) -- In a country beset by decades of
violence, President Clinton delivered a $1.3 billion U.S. aid
package Wednesday which he said would help Colombia defeat its drug
traffickers without getting the United States into a Vietnam-like
quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not get into a shooting war'' with Colombian
guerrillas, he said, standing alongside Colombian President Andres
Pastrana, both in short sleeves in the sweltering heat of this
Caribbean port city.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana stressed that Colombia has no intention of drawing the
United States into its military conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as Andres Pastrana is president, we will not have a
foreign military intervention in Colombia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There were reminders, during Clinton's half-day visit to
Cartagena, of the fear and violence that bleeds this Andean nation.
Police said they discovered and deactivated a 4.4-pound bomb found
five blocks from a neighborhood Clinton planned to tour.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the bomb was intended to spread rebel pamphlets
and would have been unlikely to cause harm. A U.S. Secret Service
official, Terry Samway, insisted that only materials for explosives
were found, not a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual display of bipartisan support, Clinton was
accompanied by House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and 10 other
members of Congress. Hastert was instrumental in pushing the aid
package through Congress, despite misgivings by some who feared the
United States would get drawn into the guerrilla conflict and help
an army long criticized for human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was also accompanied by Attorney General Janet Reno,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Barry McCaffrey,
Clinton's chief drug policy adviser -- part of a delegation of 35.
Daughter Chelsea also came along.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why are we here today?'' Hastert said. ''Not only do we share
a great heritage of democracy, but we also share a great burden'' --
the threat drugs pose both to countries that produce drugs and
those that consume them.
</P>
<P>
   ''In our nation, over 14,000 young people, children, lose their
life every year to either drug use or drug violence, and it happens
in our wealthiest communities and the street corners of our most
devastated inner cities,'' Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. assistance is part of Pastrana's $7.5 billion ''Plan
Colombia,'' designed to end decades of civil war, fight drug
trafficking, strengthen the judicial system and revive an economy
in the doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana called the U.S. assistance ''a recognition that the
menace of illegal drugs is truly international and therefore
requires a concerted global response.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised the Colombian leader, who is foundering in
opinion polls, and urged the Colombian public to ''be patient with
him'' as he struggles to find a lasting solution to a guerrilla war
that feeds off the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   Security was heavy for Clinton's entourage wherever it traveled
in this Caribbean port city. Snipers stood atop buildings at the
airport, and armed security guards stood watch in patrol boats
along the shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   But those concerns didn't prevent Clinton from mingling with a
crowd of thousands that lined the streets in a poor neighborhood
where he visited a freshly painted community justice center, a
one-stop shop for Colombians needing help resolving criminal and
civil problems. ''Clinton, Clinton,'' they crowd chanted.
</P>
<P>
   After night fell, Pastrana escorted Clinton and his entourage on
a walking tour of Cartagena's historic district, which the
president, with Chelsea at his side, cheered street dancers and
tried on one of their straw hats. Chelsea broke into a dance as a
Vallenato band using traditional accordion instruments serenaded
the group.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana said Clinton's one-day visit -- the first by a U.S.
president since George Bush came on a similar anti-drug mission in
1990 -- ''leads us to know that we are no longer isolated in our
struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said there must be an end to human rights abuses by the
warring factions in Colombia, and that includes security forces as
well as the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The largest part of the $1.3 billion U.S. contribution to Plan
Colombia is for military assistance, including 60 helicopters to be
used mostly by the Colombian army in eradicating the lucrative drug
crop. The United States already has about 100 soldiers -- mostly
members of the Army's 7th Special Forces Group from Fort Bragg,
N.C. -- in Colombia to train counternarcotics battalions of the
Colombian army.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton dismissed predictions by some in the United States that
he is starting down the path of an open-ended military commitment
in a nation that has been mired in a guerrilla war for more than
three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ''A condition of this aid is that we will not get into a
shooting war,'' Clinton said. ''This is not Vietnam, neither is it
Yankee imperialism. Those are two of the false charges that have
been hurled at Plan Colombia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There won't be American involvement in a shooting war because
they don't want it and because we don't want it,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made a plea to Colombia's South American neighbors to
support Pastrana and set aside their concerns that an intensified
drug war will have a spillover effect with refugees and guerrilla
battles on their borders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's be candid,'' Clinton said. ''If it's successful, some of
that will happen.'' But he stressed that part of the $1.3 billion
in U.S. aid to Colombia is intended to deal with these spillover
effects.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand the reluctance of the leaders of other countries
to embrace this,'' Clinton added. ''It's a frightening prospect to
take on this.'' On the other hand, he said, it would be unfair to
corral all of the region's drug problem in Colombia and expect the
Colombian people to bear the full burden.

<HEADLINE> Report: Global Warming a Threat  </HEADLINE>
By JILL LAWLESS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Global warming could fundamentally transform a
third of the world's plant and animal habitats by the end of this
century, threatening many species with rapid extinction, an
international conservation organization warned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a new report, researchers for the World Wide Fund for Nature
-- known as the World Wildlife Fund in the United States and Canada
-- singled out the Arctic and northern latitudes as the most
vulnerable to the changing climate. They estimated 20 percent of
the species there could die out due to shrinking habitat.
</P>
<P>
   The report raises the specter of a tundra denuded of its walrus
and polar bear populations and a New England stripped of its spruce
and fir forests if the amount of carbon dioxide pumped into the
atmosphere is not reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists believe that high concentrations of CO2 and
other so-called greenhouse gases trap the sun's heat in the
atmosphere, driving up temperatures and changing weather patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ''As global warming accelerates, plants and animals will come
under increasing pressure to migrate to find suitable habitat,''
said the report's co-author, Adam Markham, executive director of
the U.S.-based group Clean Air-Cool Planet.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some will just not be able to move fast enough,'' Markham
said.
</P>
<P>
   The northern latitudes of Canada, Russia and Scandinavia, where
climate change is expected to occur fastest, could lose 70 percent
of their habitat -- a level that rises to 82 percent for Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   In several countries -- including Russia, Sweden, Finland,
Estonia, Latvia, Iceland, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Georgia -- and
in seven Canadian provinces and territories, more than half the
existing habitat is at risk, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   More than a third of habitat is in danger in the U.S. states of
Maine, New Hampshire, Oregon, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Utah,
Arizona, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The projected habitat changes and species extinctions would not
be limited to northern latitudes, however. Coastal and island areas
would be at risk from warming oceans and rising waters, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   The exact nature and rate of global climate change remains
contentious. According to a study published in the July issue of
the Dutch journal Climate Change, Arctic temperatures in the late
20th century were the warmest in four centuries.
</P>
<P>
   But, critics of the global warming theory argue there's little
evidence that forces other than natural temperature swings are at
work. They have also argued that while ground monitors have shown a
sharp increase in Earth's temperatures, satellite and weather
balloon observations have shown little or no warming -- a
discrepancy that has still not been fully explained.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers evaluated data from 100 separate studies of
environmental factors in North America, Europe and Asia, including
air temperature measurements, air circulation, precipitation, sea
ice, glaciers and plant growth.
</P>
<P>
   They said parts of Alaska and Eurasia had warmed ''alarmingly''
-- by as much as 11 degrees -- during winter months during the last
30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''This compilation of research results make it undeniable that a
major warming is affecting the Arctic environment,'' said Michael
T. Ledbetter of the National Science Foundation in Washington,
which funded the study, co-authored by 11 climatologists from five
universities in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's report -- written by Markham and University of
Toronto professor Jay Malcolm -- used computer models to simulate
global climate and vegetation change under a variety of conditions.
Its projections are based on the concentration of carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere doubling from pre-industrial levels by the year
2100.
</P>
<P>
   And even that estimate is optimistic, the report said. Current
concentrations of carbon dioxide -- the gas primarily responsible
for global warming -- are about 30 percent higher than
pre-industrial levels, and could hit double the pre-industrial
level by 2050, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of habitat would place many plant and animal species in
a race for their lives, and scientists do not yet know whether they
would be able to migrate fast enough to outrun the change. The
report estimates that some species of vegetation would have to
migrate 10 times faster than during the last glacial retreat, about
10,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''A considerable portion of the globe could eventually become
devoid of tree cover,'' the report noted.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the most vulnerable species are those who live
in isolated or fragmented habitats, including the Gelada baboon of
Ethiopia; the Australian mountain pygmy possum; the monarch
butterfly, which spends its winters in Mexico; and the spoon-billed
sandpiper of Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   The report is designed to pressure politicians ahead of
November's international climate-change summit in the Dutch city of
The Hague, at which politicians will attempt to ratify the 1997
Kyoto agreement limiting greenhouse-gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many countries are trying to find loopholes in the Kyoto
agreement,'' said Andrew Kerr of the WWF's Climate Change campaign.
''They should know that the problem is much more of an immediate
threat than they realized.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Markham: ''Speed kills. We're night-driving on a mountain
road with the lights switched off.''

<HEADLINE> Colts Player Convicted of Battery  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Indianapolis Colts defensive back Mustafah
Muhammad, unable to refute testimony from his 6-year-old stepson,
was convicted Wednesday of one count of domestic battery for
beating his pregnant wife last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Nichole Muhammad, who was five months pregnant, died 10 days
later from excessive bleeding when she went into premature labor
following a car accident. Her child was stillborn.
</P>
<P>
   Mustafah Muhammad -- then known as Steve Muhammad -- was cleared
earlier this year of any responsibility in his wife's death.
Prosecutor Scott Newman instead charged Muhammad with three
misdemeanor counts of battery.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Evan Goodman, who conducted the bench trial in Superior
Court, merged two of the counts into one of domestic battery and
found Muhammad innocent of the third charge, that he struck his
stepson as the boy tried to help his mother with a toy baseball
bat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the real hero of this story is young Eric, that
6-year-old boy,'' Newman said. ''What he did in coming to the
rescue of his mother against a stepfather who is an NFL football
player, coming at him with that little yellow plastic wiffle bat is
something that is burned in my memory as an act of bravery. It was
capped off today by his coming into court and facing that man for
the first time and telling his story.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric, barely able to see over the top of the witness stand, told
how he heard his mother screaming, then he saw Muhammad twist her
arm and slam her against a window sill in the den of the family's
apartment. It was then, he said, that he went to his toy chest to
get the plastic bat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to stop daddy from hurting my mommy,'' Eric
testified.
</P>
<P>
   The boy said he hit his stepfather four times before Muhammad
grabbed the bat from his hands and struck him with it. Goodman said
Muhammad's reaction was inappropriate but ruled it did not
constitute battery.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman sentenced Muhammad to one year in jail, which he
suspended, and to one year's probation. He also ordered Muhammad to
undergo 12 weeks of domestic violence counseling and to perform 32
hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just glad to have this behind me,'' Muhammad said outside
the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was difficult to hear his stepson -- who no longer
lives with him -- testify against him.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the thing, to have your family on trial and pretty much
on opposing sides,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies who responded to a 911 call from Muhammad's wife last
Oct. 28 testified during the one-day trial that she was crying,
bruised and in pain when they arrived at the couple's apartment.
Muhammad admitted they had been arguing over money and he had tried
to grab an envelope of money from his wife's hands, but he denied
battering her or Eric.
</P>
<P>
   He denied they ever were in the den and answered ''No'' to each
of defense attorney James Voyles' questions about whether he at any
time grabbed her, threw her against a wall or the floor or twisted
her arm.
</P>
<P>
   However, Newman said the testimony from Eric was impossible to
ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought Eric's testimony was extremely compelling. This is a
kid who clearly had a clear picture in his mind and maintained a
clear picture in his mind of exactly everything that happened,''
Newman said. ''He held his ground, he told his story, he did it in
a way that was bright and articulate and powerful and strong for a
child who is only 6 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   The only defense witness was Muhammad himself.
</P>
<P>
   Also among eight prosecution witnesses were the two deputy
sheriffs who responded to the 911 call, the pathologist who
performed an autopsy on Nichole Muhammad's body and an attorney
whom Mrs. Muhammad called four days after the beating. All of them
testified about bruises they saw on the woman's body.
</P>
<P>
   Newman also played a tape recording of the 911 call, in which
she is heard screaming ''My husband is beating up on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad signed with the Colts in February 1999 as a free agent
after a season with the British Columbia Lions of the Canadian
Football League. He played in 11 games last season.
</P>
<P>
   Colts president Bill Polian would not comment on Muhammad's
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ''The club's stance throughout this matter is that the only
parties appropriate to comment are empowered by the legal or
judicial system,'' Polian said. ''The judicial system has reached
its decision, and the club will have no comment. We will have
whatever discussions the league deems appropriate. Should the
league wish to comment, it will.''
</P>
<P>
   A telephone message was left seeking comment from NFL spokesman
Greg Aiello.

<HEADLINE> Browns Finally Get Backup QB  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- After being booed and kicked out of
Philadelphia, Doug Pederson will get the red-carpet treatment in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Pederson, a seven-year veteran released by the Eagles on Sunday,
will be the Browns' backup quarterback for Tim Couch this season.
Cleveland has offered the 31-year-old Pederson a two-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns have been looking for a backup QB since losing Ty
Detmer, who tore an Achilles' tendon during an exhibition game
against Chicago and is out for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Spergon Wynn is currently Cleveland's No. 2 QB with
rookie Kevin Thompson the No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Pederson, who has also played for Green Bay and Miami, was
expected to arrive Wednesday night and will take a physical
Thursday morning. Barring any problems, he'll practice with the
Browns by afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Pederson had initially turned down an offer to come to
Cleveland, saying he wanted to spend some time with his family
following his release by the Eagles and a tumultuous '99 season in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Pederson started nine games for the Eagles, before being benched
in favor of rookie Donovan McNabb. Earlier Wednesday, Browns coach
Chris Palmer said he thought Pederson had been left ''emotionally
scarred'' after being treated harshly by fans and media in Philly.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were prepared to go with the two young backups,'' said
Dwight Clark, Cleveland's director of football operations.
''Personally, you feel more comfortable with someone who has
experience just in case Tim were to go down for whatever reason.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it'll take two or maybe three weeks for Doug to get up
to speed with the offense. I would anticipate he will be inactive
for a while until he learns the offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Pederson was Green Bay's third-string quarterback when the
Packers went to the Super Bowl in 1996 and '97. He has completed
137 of 259 passes for 1,445 yards and nine touchdowns in his
career.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Cops Arrest Drug Runner  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Police have arrested a convicted drug
trafficker for allegedly hijacking a Brazilian airliner carrying 72
people and fleeing with $3.3 million in stolen funds, authorities
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gerson Palermo, 43, who has two drug convictions, was arrested
late Tuesday in downtown Sao Paulo, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He used to be one of the biggest drug runners in Brazil,''
said federal police officer Gilberto Tadeu.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Palermo led four men armed with handguns in
hijacking the plane Aug. 16, forcing it to land at an isolated
airstrip in southern Brazil and fleeing in a waiting car with $3.3
million taken from the cargo hold. The money belonged to the
state-owned Bank of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 66 passengers aboard the Vasp Airline jet were
tourists from Italy, France and Japan returning from the famous
Iguacu Falls on the border with Argentina. They and the six crew
members were all unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers on the hijacked plane identified Palermo from photos
shown to them by investigators, Tadeu said. Detectives then traced
Palermo to a location near Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   No other arrests have yet been made in the case, and no cash has
been recovered, Tadeu said.
</P>
<P>
   Palermo was being held in the southern Brazil city of Londrina,
some 210 miles west of Sao Paulo, near where the airliner was
forced to land, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Palermo was a pilot and was raised in the area,
factors they claimed helped him in planning the robbery.

<HEADLINE> Press: Peru Press Needs Freedom  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Despite the appearance of a free press, Peru
needs to take steps to ensure against media interference by its
intelligence agency, a delegation of U.S. and Latin American
newspaper publishers said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That was one of several recommendations presented by a two-day
mission from the Inter American Press Association to President
Alberto Fujimori, the IAPA said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation, led by Houston Chronicle Publisher Tony
Pederson, president of the association, met with Fujimori on
Tuesday for about two hours in the Government Palace.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is freedom of the press in Peru, but there are threats
in motion,'' Pederson told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori said after the meeting that he recognized
''imperfections'' and that ''certain acts are committed that could
be considered attempts against press liberty.'' But he called those
cases ''isolated.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's critics contend that the National Intelligence
Service controls the editorial content of Peru's cheap tabloid
newspapers, which frequently launch coordinated smear campaigns
against government opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups also have long complained that journalists
are routinely subject to death threats and other forms of
intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   Pederson said the organization offered to work with Fujimori's
government to improve conditions for journalism, but that ''it is
difficult to comprehend (the government's) intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's difficult to be optimistic,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Vermont man pleads guilty to videotaping young girls  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUEENSBURY, N.Y. (AP) - A Starksboro, Vt., man will spend up to
25 years in federal prison after he admitted sneaking into an
elementary school locker room to videotape young girls.
</P>
<P>
   George E. Hall, 62, pleaded guilty Wednesday to three counts of
felony burglary and one count of possessing a sexual performance by
a child. As part of the plea bargain, 10 other counts were
dismissed but Hall agreed to stand in a lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Hall is expected to receive 8 1-3 to 25 years in a federal
penitentiary when he is sentenced Oct. 4.
</P>
<P>
   If he is identified in the lineup, he may face other charges
including sexual abuse, according to Warren County District
Attorney Sterling Goodspeed. Those charges are not believed to be
connected to the taping of the elementary school girls.
</P>
<P>
   Hall also faces federal weapons charges in Vermont. He had three
prior felony convictions for lewd conduct with a child in Vermont
and one previous conviction for lewd conduct and indecent assault
on a child in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Hall was arrested in March after he was reported acting
suspicious wearing a wig in a Queensbury elementary school. Police
said they found video tapes in Hall's car revealing what are
believed to be images of sexual contact with girls.
</P>
<P>
   Queensbury is 50 miles north of Albany.

<HEADLINE> Judge Won't Rule on Reform Party  </HEADLINE>
By KIA SHANT'E BREAUX
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYNCHBURG, Va. (AP) -- A federal judge ruled Wednesday that he
does not have jurisdiction to decide who is the Reform Party's real
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Allies of Pat Buchanan sought an order barring an opposing
faction from operating under the party's name. U.S. District Judge
Norman K. Moon said he lacked jurisdiction because the power
struggle did not raise any constitutional issue.
</P>
<P>
   During the party's convention in Long Beach, Calif., earlier
this month, delegates opposed to Buchanan declared his nomination
illegitimate and walked out. That group then held its own
convention across the street and nominated John Hagelin, a
physicist from Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are seeking $12.6 million in Federal Election
Commission money and have been working to get on state ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Cooter, attorney for the Buchanan faction, said he will
take the issue to a state court, possibly as early as next week. He
wasn't sure where he would file.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hagelin hasn't seen the last of me just yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cooter said he was disappointed with the judge's ruling. ''We
felt this was the appropriate place to get a speedy and fair
decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Moon presided over a power struggle between opposing
party factions seeking control of $2.5 million in party funds. Moon
ruled that Pat Choate, the 1996 running mate of party founder Ross
Perot, was the party's legitimate chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Mangia, a Hagelin backer, called Wednesday's ruling ''a
small victory.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This dispute will go on until Pat Buchanan goes back to the
Republican Party where he belongs,'' Mangia said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan left the GOP last October to run under the Reform Party
banner.
</P>
<P>
   State election commissions across the country are grappling to
decide whether Buchanan or Hagelin should appear on their general
election ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Two states, Iowa and Montana, literally have pulled names out of
hats to decide who would be listed. Buchanan won in Iowa; Hagelin
won in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Several states reached ballot decisions Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, Hagelin will appear as the Reform Party candidate,
with Buchanan as the Colorado Freedom Party nominee. Buchanan's
supporters promised an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan's secretary of state rejected both candidates because
of ''discrepancies'' over who is the rightful chair of the Reform
Party of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, the State Election Commission said Buchanan
would be listed. In North Carolina, the state Reform Party sued to
stop the Board of Elections from printing ballots with Buchanan as
the Reform Party candidate. A hearing was scheduled for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   California Reform Party Chairman Ray Mills submitted Buchanan's
name as the nominee for a second time on Wednesday, but the state
party's board again said the move was illegitimate. A spokeswoman
for the secretary of state said elections officials would rule
Thursday on the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Virginia, Choate, who stepped down as party
chairman due to family illness, accused Hagelin's supporters of
trying to delay any decision in the dispute until after the
November election.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a tear-down strategy. What we need to do and what we
will do is get into court where we can put them under oath and
everyone will see the game that is going on,'' said Choate. ''I'm
very disappointed in Hagelin and the other people for not being
willing to come to court so that we can have it out under oath.''
</P>
<P>
   Mangia said the Buchanan faction has no case.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously the judge realized this was a bogus attempt to
subvert the democratic process, to subvert the Federal Election
Commission and federal election law and he wasn't going to stand
for it,'' said Mangia.
</P>
<P>
   Mangia said he has filed a complaint with the FEC alleging fraud
by the Buchanan faction. He claims the other side is seeking refuge
in the courts to keep the FEC from getting involved in the dispute
and deciding who gets the $12.6 million.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Affirms Palestinian Claim  </HEADLINE>
By SARAH EL DEEB
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Egypt (AP) -- Egypt's foreign minister said his
country was firm in its support for Palestinian sovereignty in
Jerusalem Wednesday after a meeting between President Hosni Mubarak
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting in Alexandria was the sixth time since the collapse
of the Camp David talks last July that the two leaders met. Neither
spoke with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''As there is Israeli sovereignty over west Jerusalem there
should be Palestinian sovereignty over east Jerusalem. This is the
logic of justice ... and of international agreements,'' Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak has emerged as a key mediator after the U.S.-brokered
Camp David summit between Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak collapsed over their rival claims to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton underlined Egypt's importance a day before,
when he stopped in Cairo to talk with Mubarak following a three-day
trip to Africa. U.S. and Egyptian officials stressed they will
continue their drive to achieve peace, but that there were no signs
of a breakthrough following the Clinton-Mubarak meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak said Tuesday the Egyptians were working to help the
Israelis and Palestinians draft a framework agreement to guide
their negotiations. Moussa added Wednesday that Jerusalem was not
the only issue to be ironed out.
</P>
<P>
   With little apparent flexibility on Jerusalem, it was difficult
to predict progress.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no concessions or ambiguities regarding the position
on east Jerusalem as a capital for the Palestinian state,'' Moussa
said. East Jerusalem was captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast
war.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Wednesday, Israeli Foreign Minister Schlomo Ben-Ami
urged Arafat to respond to new ideas put forward by Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Berlin after discussing the peace
process with his German counterpart, Joschka Fischer, Ben-Ami said
that he welcomed Egypt's efforts to mediate an end to the
half-century-old conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ''As to Mubarak's proposals, they need to be studied and we need
to see what is forthcoming from the Palestinian side,'' Ben-Ami
said. ''If we are to start considering new ideas, we have to know
if Arafat is also interesting in contemplating them.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released later by the Israeli Foreign Ministry,
Ben-Ami said Germany must tell Arafat in the clearest possible way
''that the moment of truth has arrived, and he can no longer evade
fateful decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel and the Palestinians have set a Sept. 13 deadline for
concluding peace talks.

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Green Party presidential candidate Ralph
Nader told a U.N. meeting of grass-roots organizations Wednesday
that multinational corporations are the biggest threat to
democracies today.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations concentrate power and wealth in the hands of the
few at the expense of the many, Nader told the closing session of
the annual U.N. conference of non-governmental organizations that
is being held ahead of the U.N. Millennium Summit next week.
</P>
<P>
   Naming tobacco, pharmaceutical and banking industries, the
longtime consumer advocate said corporations exert too much control
over governments, threatening them with ultimatums and the loss of
access to markets.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my judgment and the judgment of many ... the global
corporation is now the major threat to democratic processes in our
world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls have given Nader, who has supporters among American
environmentalists, labor unions and foes of the World Trade
Organization, between 4 percent and 6 percent support.
</P>
<P>
   Nader didn't mention his Republican or Democratic challengers in
his speech.

<HEADLINE> Yankees Not Counting on Knoblauch  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Chuck Knoblauch's sore elbow might sideline him
for the remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our plan has to be that we're not going to have him,'' New
York Yankees manager Joe Torre said before Wednesday night's game
against Seattle. ''To start counting on him isn't healthy for me.
There's been no improvement in his elbow.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees second baseman has been on the disabled list since
Aug. 3 because of tendinitis in his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Torre expected to see Knoblauch on Friday night, or soon
thereafter, when the Yankees return home to play Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's not sure.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a question I can't answer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch is in Tampa, Fla., on a rehabilitation assignment. He
started at second base for Tampa in Kissimmee, Fla., on Friday
night but was hit by a pitch in his left knee and was taken out of
the game as a precaution. A magnetic resonance imaging test showed
his knee was fine.
</P>
<P>
   His elbow is not.
</P>
<P>
   ''He doesn't feel well enough to play,'' Torre said. ''His elbow
is bothering him. I feel bad for Chuck. I was hoping we'd get some
at bats for him, but I don't know if that's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch has played in 78 games this season. He's hitting .291
with five home runs, 22 RBIs and 11 stolen bases. He's committed 15
errors.
</P>
<P>
   Without Knoblauch, the Yankees can play Luis Sojo or Jose
Vizcaino at second. Sojo has hit safely in 17 of 19 games since
joining New York. He was acquired Aug. 7 from Pittsburgh. Vizcaino
came to the Yankees June 21 in a trade with Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Sojo was in the lineup at second base Wednesday night for the
third time in the Mariners series.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said it wasn't the right time to see where Knoblauch was
by giving him at-bats for the Yankees, who are trying to win the AL
East title against Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to be able to test people in a pennant race,''
Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Paul O'Neill was back in the Yankees' lineup
Wednesday night after missing six games in a row because of a right
hip pointer. He was removed from a game against Texas last
Wednesday night as a precaution because of a sore right hip.
</P>
<P>
   ''It feels better every day,'' O'Neill said before taking
batting practice. ''It's a lot better today.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He said he was ready to go,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder David Justice was in the lineup Wednesday night
after being taken out of Tuesday night's game, a 5-3 loss to the
Mariners, for a pinch-runner in the seventh inning. He has a tender
groin.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nothing he can't play with, but it affects the way he
moves around,'' Torre said. ''It's something he plays in spite
of.''

<HEADLINE> Tex., Va. Execute Convicted Killers  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GRACZYK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A paroled burglar was executed
Wednesday for beating and stabbing his parents and sister to death
12 years ago. Also Wednesday, a man was executed in Virginia for
crushing the skulls of his neighbor and her young daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffery Henry Caldwell, 37, was the sixth Texas inmate given a
lethal injection this month and the 32nd this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy final statement, he expressed love for his family,
including two brothers who had testified during his punishment
phase that he remained a threat to society.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can forgive you all but you must ask for forgiveness from
God,'' Caldwell said. ''I leave now to join my parents and my only
sister.''
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell was on parole and had previous convictions for burglary
and robbery when the killings occurred. He told police that his
parents, Henry and Gwendolyn Caldwell, and his 19-year-old sister,
Kimberly, had run into his knife during an argument over money in
their Dallas home.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, in an interview on death row, Caldwell blamed the
fatal attacks on a Jamaican mob angry because he had stolen some of
their drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, Russel W. Burket, 32, who had been given a last
minute stay by the Supreme Court two months ago, also was executed
by injection Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Burket's attorney, Anthony A. Protogyrou, had argued that his
client was mentally disabled and wasn't thinking correctly when he
pleaded guilty in 1994 to killing his neighbor, Katherine Tafelski,
and her 5-year-old daughter, Ashley, by crushing their skulls with
a rusty crowbar.
</P>
<P>
   Protogyrou also had sought more tests on a washcloth found at
the crime scene with traces of semen. Previous testing matched the
DNA to about 8 percent of all white men, including Burket and his
brother. Lester Burket Jr. was questioned by police about the 1993

</P>
<P>
   Russel Burket's execution originally was set for June 21, but
the Supreme Court granted him a stay 75 minutes before he was
scheduled to die. Eight days later, the court refused to hear his
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Burket made no final statement from the death chamber Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Bobby West said Burket was in a ''good frame of mind''
before the execution and understood what was about to happen. ''He
has repented all his sins,'' West said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Confirms Fighting in Congo  </HEADLINE>
By ARNAUD ZAJTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) -- Rebel and government forces exchanged
attacks in northern Congo, U.N. officials said Wednesday, in the
first fighting since the government unilaterally suspended a
cease-fire a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ugandan-backed Congolese Liberation Movement rebels fired shells
at government soldiers near the town of Emate in Equateur province,
U.N. observer squadron leader Pete Riley told journalists at a
press conference in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, President Laurent Kabila's forces bombed the
rebel positions at the town of Lokutu, west of the Congo River port
city of Kisangani, Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks, which ended a two-week lull in fighting, likely
occurred in recent days. But few details are available, Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting in Congo broke out in August 1998 when rebels,
backed by Rwanda and Uganda, accused Kabila of corruption and
harboring Hutu militiamen who fled Rwanda after committing genocide
there in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila and his allies -- Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia -- signed a
cease-fire agreement last year with Rwanda, Uganda and the rebels.
But the fighting has continued.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the government announced its unilateral decision to
suspend the cease-fire deal amid mutual accusations of violations.
</P>
<P>
   That announcement came one day after the Congolese government
gave permission for U.N. peacekeeping forces to deploy throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council has proposed a monitoring force of
5,537 observers and troops to oversee the peace accord but say it
is waiting for all sides to respect the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   The council said Wednesday that even though Congo has approved
the deployment, it still must clarify whether it intends to abide
by the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   The council members, meeting at U.N. headquarters in New York,
said they hoped the upcoming Millennium Summit of world leaders
would give the warring sides in Congo a chance to recommit
themselves to the agreement and advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats have expressed doubts about how the United Nations
could deploy a peacekeeping force to monitor a cease-fire agreement
that Congo is not participating in.

<HEADLINE> Mets 1, Astros 0  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Rick Reed and two relievers combined on a
three-hitter to make an early run stand up, and the New York Mets
beat the Houston Astros 1-0 Wednesday night to hold on to their
share of the NL East lead.
</P>
<P>
   New York, a major league-best 31-16 since the All-Star game,
remained tied with Atlanta at 79-54. The Braves beat the Cincinnati
Reds 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Holt (6-13) didn't allow much. But his wildness led to a
first-inning run, and it was too much for the Astros to overcome as
he dropped to 0-3 in four career appearances against the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Holt walked Benny Agbayani in the first and gave up a single to
Darryl Hamilton. Agbayani advanced when Edgardo Alfonzo bounced
into a double play and came home when Holt bounced a wild pitch
with Mike Piazza batting.
</P>
<P>
   New York only advanced one more runner past second, but it
didn't matter because Mets pitchers allowed no one past second and
only one runner past first.
</P>
<P>
   Reed (9-4) gave up three hits in seven innings, struck out six
and walked two. Turk Wendell pitched a 1-2-3 eighth, and Armando
Benitez struck out the side in the ninth for his 36th save in 40
chances.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros lost a 1-0 game for the first time since Aug. 23,
1996, to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   New York, tied with Atlanta since Monday night, improved to
26-15 in one-run games, while Houston dropped to 10-27, the worst
in baseball. The Mets also played their fifth 1-0 game of the
season, winning for the third time.
</P>
<P>
Notes: LHP Al Leiter felt better Wednesday, manager Bobby
Valentine said, a day after the pitcher left after three innings
with a strained muscle in his right buttocks in an 11-1 loss to the
Astros. ... OF Derek Bell (bruised left knee) felt better, but was
still a day or two from playing. ... Holt's seven wild pitches tied
Scott Elarton for the Astros' high. ... New York has won 19 of its
last 24 home games but plays just 12 of its last 29 games at Shea
Stadium.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Russian-born ballerina Tatiana Riabouchinska,
an internationally celebrated star in the 1930s and 1940s who
taught dance in Southern California for a half-century, died Aug.
24 of heart failure. She was 84.
</P>
<P>
   She won renown for her classical performances, including the
title role of ''Giselle,'' but was most identified with a part she
didn't actually dance: the hippopotamus ballerina in Walt Disney's
1940 animated movie ''Fantasia.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney animators sketched her at rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, Riabouchinska studied ballet with Alexander Volinine
and Mathilde Kschessinskaya.
</P>
<P>
   Choreographer George Balanchine later recruited her for the
Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo, then based in France. At age 15,
Riabouchinska was the oldest of three publicized by the company's
as its ''baby ballerinas.''
</P>
<P>
   She was later featured in ''La Concurrence,'' ''Cotillon,''
''Jeux d'Enfants,'' ''Les Presages,'' ''Cendrillon'' and
''Paganini.''

<HEADLINE> Japan's Aid To China In Peril  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China's stepped-up naval activities near Japan
imperil aid from Tokyo, Japan's foreign minister said Wednesday,
urging both sides to settle their differences and improve ties.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo is committed to helping China's economic development, but
opposition in Japan is forcing a more critical look at that aid,
Foreign Minister Yohei Kono said in a speech to the Chinese
Communist Party's main training institute.
</P>
<P>
   Future economic cooperation with China ''hinges more than ever
upon receiving the full understanding and support of both the
Japanese and Chinese peoples,'' Kono told scholars at the Central
Party School.
</P>
<P>
   His speech pinpointed areas of mistrust -- Chinese missile
buildups and fears of resurgent Japanese militarism.
</P>
<P>
   But he offered lengthy suggestions for opportunities to
cooperate, among them a Northeast Asian security forum involving
Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Russia, China and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Japan gives China more than $3.6 billion in economic aid
annually, widely seen as a form of compensation for Japan's brutal
wartime occupation of much of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers from Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party
postponed approval of $160 million in low-interest loans last week,
reflecting worries over the Chinese navy's increased
intelligence-gathering near Japanese waters, sometimes under the
guise of conducting oceanic surveys.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kono said he and Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan
took a ''meaningful step forward'' this week by agreeing to inform
each other of scientific expeditions around each other's waters.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese worry about China's increased military spending and
growing arsenal of missiles, Kono said.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, in a meeting Wednesday with Kono,
said he wanted to promote trust by meeting public and government
figures during his planned visit to Japan in October.
</P>
<P>
   Friendly China-Japan ties ''are hard won'' and should be
treasured ''so as not to cause misunderstanding and unfriendly
voices,'' China's official Xinhua News Agency reported Zhu as
saying.
</P>
<P>
   Central Party School scholars have been highly critical of the
U.S.-Japan alliance and have at times accused Tokyo of secretly
harboring ambitions of military expansionism.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently seeking to allay those suspicions, Kono said Japan
would never allow a return to a militarist state and called a
competitive military expansion by either China or Japan ''utterly
unfathomable.''
</P>
<P>
   China's Communist Party drew much of its early support from
resistance to Japanese invaders and deep antipathy toward Japan
endures among many politically active Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The government and the state-controlled media help keep memories
of Japanese wartime aggression and atrocities fresh. The southern
city of Nanning was to hold a day of mourning Wednesday for more
than 360 residents who died in a 1938 bombing of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese President Jiang Zemin -- apparently seeking to smooth
concerns in Tokyo over Chinese naval activities -- said Tuesday that
there was ''no change'' in his country's friendly attitude toward
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Kono and his Chinese counterpart, Tang Jiaxuan, have agreed that
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji would visit Japan from Oct. 12-17.

<HEADLINE> Giants 2, Pirates 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Russ Ortiz won his sixth consecutive start and
Barry Bonds hit his 484th career home run as the San Francisco
Giants beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 2-0 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz (11-10) allowed four hits in seven innings and matched his
career high with 12 strikeouts. He was 6-0 with a 1.31 ERA in
August.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates loaded the bases with one out in the sixth, but
second baseman Ramon Martinez made a leaping catch of Warren
Morris' liner and Emil Brown struck out on a 95 mph fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz left for a pinch-hitter in the eighth after throwing 113
pitches. He improved to 5-0 with a 1.39 ERA in seven career
appearances against Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Robb Nen pitched a perfect ninth for his 32nd save. The NL
West-leading Giants have won 11 of their last 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds' home run was his 39th of the season and came in the
fourth off Jimmy Anderson (4-7). Bonds doubled with two outs in the
sixth and scored on Ellis Burks' single.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds has 89 homers at Three Rivers Stadium, second only to
Willie Stargell's 147.
</P>
<P>
   Giants manager Dusty Baker expects to give Bonds the day off
Thursday, meaning this might have been the All-Star outfielder's
final game at Three Rivers, where his major league career began in
1986 with Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson lost his third consecutive start.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates, who beat the Giants 8-0 on a one-hitter Tuesday,
have not won consecutive games since they defeated San Diego at
home on July 28-29.
Notes: Bonds has passed Stan Musial, Stargell, Dave Winfield and
Carl Yastrzemski on the career home run list this year. His next
target is No. 17 Lou Gehrig at 493. ... The Pirates are guaranteed
of a single-digit win total this month. They're 8-20 this month
with one game left. ... Ortiz's other 12-strikeout game came
against Houston on June 25.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Homes Inspected for Mercury  </HEADLINE>
By BENNIE CURRIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPERVILLE, Ill. (AP) -- A gas company announced Wednesday it
will test 200,000 homes across Chicago's far northern and western
suburbs for possible contamination by mercury, a toxic metal that
can damage the kidneys and brain.
</P>
<P>
   The first homes inspected will be those where old-fashioned gas
regulators have been removed within the past five years, Nicor Gas
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our primary goal is to give our customers the peace of mind
that they deserve,'' said Nicor CEO Tom Fisher. ''We believe that
we have been careful over the decades but we want to make sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Naperville-based company had inspected 255 homes by Monday
and found higher than normal mercury levels in about one-sixth of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Nicor began looking into possible mercury spills on July 20 when
the company discovered traces from a liquid mercury spill after a
contractor replaced an old gas regulator, which controls the flow
of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Company inspectors went through homes in 11 suburbs this month,
and on Friday it detected mercury in a home where one of its own
technicians had removed an outdated regulator.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 322 homes have been inspected, Nicor spokesman Lee
Haines said Wednesday. He said there had been some evacuations and
cleanups, but he did not know how many.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois Attorney General Jim Ryan said Nicor told his office
Tuesday that it could take up to six months to complete the
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Nicor is paying for blood and urine tests, and the Illinois
Department of Public Health said Monday that results which had come
back so far show only one person out of 10 with an elevated level
of mercury.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury, a silver, odorless liquid, has been used in everything
from thermometers and blood pressure gauges to older gas meters.
Most health experts agree that short exposures to small amounts are
relatively harmless -- for example, when a thermometer breaks. The
trouble comes, they say, when the liquid vaporizes.
</P>
<P>
   Ten families filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Nicor and
contractor Henkels &AMP; McCoy seeking damages of more than $50,000 for
each person exposed to spilled mercury. A similar lawsuit was filed
last week.
</P>
<P>
   April Panfil and her family have been living in hotels for five
weeks, ever since Nicor inspectors found mercury in their house
believed to have been tracked in by her children from a neighbor's
home.
</P>
<P>
   As they soon as they conducted the tests and discovered mercury,
''we were (evacuated) right then and there with the clothes we were
wearing,'' Panfil, 28, said.
</P>
<P>
   The furniture, their clothing, toys and anything lying on the
floor was taken from the home, she said, and the family was sent to
a physician who found traces of mercury contamination. ''But they
haven't told us what that means,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 4, Marlins 2  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Will Clark homered in the second inning and added
an RBI double in the ninth, giving the St. Louis Cardinals a 4-2
win over the Florida Marlins on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Edmonds snapped an 0-for-21 streak with a single in the
sixth and added another base hit leading off the ninth with the
game tied at 2. Clark followed with a double to right-center,
scoring Edmonds from first for the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   Clark moved to third on a sacrifice and scored on Ray Lankford's
single off Antonio Alfonseca (4-6).
</P>
<P>
   Dave Veres pitched the ninth for his 24th save in 29 chances.
Matt Morris (2-3) pitched the eighth for the win.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins took a 1-0 lead in the first. Andy Fox singled,
moved to second on a walk to Cliff Floyd and scored on Preston
Wilson's fielder's choice. Fox scored from second as the Cardinals
tried to turn an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis went ahead 2-1 with back-to-back home runs to lead off
the second. Clark hit his eighth of the season on a 2-0 pitch from
Reid Cornelius. Craig Paquette followed two pitches later with his
10th.
</P>
<P>
   Cornelius kept the Cardinals quiet after the homers. He retired
15 of the next 18 batters before getting pulled for a pinch hitter
in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Cornelius allowed four hits in six innings en route to his
eighth no-decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins tied the game in the sixth. Floyd led off with a
double and scored on Mark Smith's broken-bat single to right field.
Florida loaded the bases with two outs, but pinch-hitter Kevin
Millar struck out looking.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Marlins OF Henry Rodriguez left the game in the fifth
inning after experiencing dizziness. ... Florida's Luis Castillo
got his major league-leading 48th infield hit with a bunt single in
the third. ... Wilson struck out twice, giving him 166 this season,
23 shy of Bobby Bonds' major league record set in 1970. ... St.
Louis recorded back-to-back homers for the 14th time this season
and first time since May 24 against the Marlins. ... Cornelius was
charged with his league-leading fourth and fifth balks.

1.5M Kids Have Parent in Prison

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly 1.5 million American children have a mother or

swelling of the nation's prison population, the Justice Department reported
today. The department's Bureau of Justice Statistics said that at the end of
last year 1,498,800 children under age 18 had a parent in prison in this
country. That was a 60 percent increase since 1991 -- up 562,300 from the
936,500 children in that category then. During the same interval, the nation's
prison population grew by an almost identical 62 percent, to 1,284,894 prisoners
in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Judge Blasts Texas Medicaid Plan  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas has failed to adequately care for the
1.5 million low-income children in its Medicaid program, a federal
judge has ruled, giving the state until October to find a solution.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling lands in the middle of the presidential race, fueling
Al Gore's argument that Texas Gov. George W. Bush has failed to
provide health care to his state's children.
</P>
<P>
   The court found that Texas was not adequately providing dental
care, regular checkups, transportation to doctors or information
about what services are available to children in Medicaid, despite
a 1996 agreement in which the state promised to make major
improvements in its program.
</P>
<P>
   ''A poor and often-isolated population should not be robbed of
their rights to services,'' wrote U.S. District Judge William Wayne
Justice, a Democrat who has issued sweeping rulings on racial
segregation, education for immigrants and prison conditions since
being appointed by President Johnson in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   The state's attorney general said Wednesday that Texas would
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his top aides traveling with him were caught off guard.
The Texas governor told reporters he had not reviewed the judge's
order. ''But we have a good record signing people up to Medicaid,''
he said, without mentioning the services children get once they are
signed up -- the subject of the court case.
</P>
<P>
   Gore declined to comment, saying he hadn't read the decision.
But others in his campaign wasted little time criticizing Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush has an obligation to explain that strong and
very troubling court decision,'' said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, Gore's
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign spokesman Mark Fabiani called the ruling a ''sweeping
indictment of the way George Bush has run his state's Medicaid
system.''
</P>
<P>
   It fits Gore's rap on Bush. The vice president regularly
complains that there are 1.4 million Texas children without health
insurance and that Bush tried to limit eligibility for a new
program aimed at getting insurance to the children in working poor
families.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign said the governor is working to fix the
problems in Medicaid and pointed the finger at the Democratic
administration that preceded Bush, who was elected in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a decade-long challenge that Texas is addressing,''
said Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett. ''We are aggressively working to
provide health care to those children.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial class-action lawsuit was filed in 1993. The state
signed a consent decree promising change in 1996. On Aug. 14, the
court issued a 175-page ruling that found the state had failed to
fix its problems in the program, which serves about 1.5 million
Texans under age 18.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the poor in Texas declined to blame Bush, but said
he did not provide leadership when the system needed it.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want to bring about change then you talk about it, you
give speeches about it, you lay out proposals and you put your name
on it and say 'this is my plan,''' said Lisa McGiffert, a health
expert at Consumers Union in Austin, Texas. ''Bush can do it and
has done it on tort reform and other issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The sweeping order is likely to force the state to consider
major changes -- including higher payments to dentists and
reconsideration of its managed care plan.
</P>
<P>
   The court found Texas had failed to inform families about the
benefits available -- even when they asked. About 1 million kids
never saw a dentist last year, and most who did were there for
emergency treatment -- such as an inability to eat -- that could have
been prevented.
</P>
<P>
   It found major problems for children enrolled in health
maintenance organizations and other managed care plans. Like other
states, Texas is in the process of moving its Medicaid population
into managed care, which is cheaper and has a reputation for
providing strong preventive care.
</P>
<P>
   But the court found that the checkups ''were grossly inadequate
and incomplete'' -- taking just 12 to 20 minutes when a proper exam
would take an hour. Fewer than 10 percent of kids had received
proper immunizations.
</P>
<P>
   For poor families who don't own a car, getting to the doctor is
often the most difficult part of getting health care, so Medicaid
pays for transportation. The court found that Texans often were not
reimbursed for months, could not get vouchers to which they were
entitled, and spent entire days arranging and waiting for
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The burden this creates ... can be overwhelming,'' the judge
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   A toll-free number was established to give participants
information about what preventive services are available, but the
court found that it took a long time for anyone to answer the phone
-- the record wait was 13 minutes and 2 seconds -- and the staff that
did answer were ''often unhelpful or lack knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling also concluded that Texas failed to address the needs
of about 13,200 abused and neglected children under state
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett said the state had added staff and increased budgets in
an attempt to reach more children and provide more families with
transportation. He said that the portion of children getting
preventive care has climbed since 1993, and he said that while only
38 percent of kids saw a dentist last year, that's better than the
national average.
</P>
<P>
   But the court found that much of the data used to show
improvement was inflated. And while more money may be spent on
transportation, the court found that only 2 percent of those
eligible had used it in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling gives the Texas Health and Human Services Commission
60 days to prepare a plan of corrective action -- meaning it is due
just weeks before Election Day.

<HEADLINE> Cuba To Deport Swedish Journalists  </HEADLINE>
By VIVIAN SEQUERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Three Swedish journalists detained for working in
Cuba without proper visas will be sent back to Sweden, Swedish
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban authorities on Tuesday detained Peter Goetell, Birger
Thureson and Helena Soederqvist, reporters with provincial Swedish
newspapers, for working as journalists and attending seminars in
Cuba after entering the country on tourist visas.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban Ministry for Foreign Affairs sent Swedish officials a
message Wednesday saying the three would be put on an Air France
flight at 8 p.m. Thursday, Swedish Foreign Ministry spokesman Johan
Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh had sent a formal protest to
Cuba on Wednesday over the detentions.
</P>
<P>
   The organization that sponsored them, the Swedish International
Liberal Center (SILC), a foundation close to that country's Liberal
Party, said they were on a personal trip to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're in Cuba as individuals on their free time, to meet
independent journalists in Cuba and talk with them how the Swedish
freedom of press works,'' Madeleine Sjoestedt, the SILC's secretary
general, told the Swedish news agency TT.
</P>
<P>
   The three remained in detention Wednesday, Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Swedish Embassy in Havana had talked with the
three ''several times ... they are all right,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government had no immediate comment on the detentions,
which Sjoestedt described as ''harassing people who want to express
their free thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuba, like many other countries, requires foreign journalists to
apply for visas to do reporting work in the country. Most of Cuba's
domestic press works for state-owned media outlets, and independent
journalists here have complained of alleged government harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Party leader Lars Leijonborg suggested in a letter to
Lindh that ''Sweden should withdraw its aid to Cuba until Cuba
shows greater respect for the human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Thureson worked for Nya Dagen, a small religious newspaper;
Goetell for the daily Sundsvalls Tidning, and Soederqvist for Avika
Nyheter, a small regional paper.

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested in Train Derailment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKINGS, S.D. (AP) -- Authorities have arrested a man they
suspect tampered with a rail switch, causing a train derailment
that killed one man and seriously injured another, federal
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Goltz, 20, was arrested Tuesday night. He is to be
arraigned Thursday in Sioux Falls on a charge of willful derailment
or damage to a train involved in interstate commerce, U.S. Attorney
Ted McBride said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the Saturday incident, the Dakota, Minnesota &AMP; Eastern
Railroad train was diverted to a side track and plowed into parked
rail cars. One crew member died and the train engineer was
seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   According to an affidavit by FBI agent Douglas Heilman, Goltz
admitted that he broke a lock off the switching mechanism, moved
the switch to direct the train off the main track and covered a
warning reflector with a plastic garbage bag.
</P>
<P>
   ''Goltz claimed to have committed these acts as a 'prank,'''
Heilman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Goltz was being held without bail Wednesday night in the
Minnehaha County Jail, and jail officials declined to allow him to
be interviewed. It was not clear whether he had hired an attorney
or whether one had been appointed for him.
</P>
<P>
   Goltz has no connection to the DM&AMP;E nor any group opposed to the
railroad's $1.4 billion plan to renovate some tracks and build a
new line into the Wyoming coal fields, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal law stipulates a punishment of life in prison or the
death penalty if the crime results in death. The Justice Department
will make a recommendation to Attorney General Janet Reno on
whether to seek the death penalty for a conviction, McBride said.

<HEADLINE> Orioles 5, Tigers 1  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Jose Mercedes pitched a two-hitter for his
first complete game since 1997 as the Baltimore Orioles sent the
Detroit Tigers back under .500 with a 5-1 victory Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes (10-5) allowed only three baserunners in improving to
5-1 over his last seven starts. Damion Easley got an infield hit in
the second inning, Jose Macias walked in the third and Brad Ausmus
homered in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Ausmus was the only runner to get past first base against
Mercedes, who is 3-0 against the Tigers this season. Mercedes
retired 16 straight batters before Ausmus connected, ruining the
right-hander's bid for his second career shutout.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third career complete game for Mercedes, who struck
out five. He went the distance twice with the Milwaukee Brewers in
1997, including a four-hit shutout against the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Lewis had three hits and two RBIs for the Orioles, who have
won seven of 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers, who started the season 9-23, have reached .500 three
times this month. But they've failed on each occasion to rise above
the break-even point.
</P>
<P>
   Hideo Nomo (5-11), vying for his third straight win, allowed
four runs and five hits in five-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles used four-run sixth to take a 5-0 lead. After Delino
DeShields chased Nomo with a single to load the bases, Albert Belle
singled in two runs off Willie Blair and Jeff Conine added an RBI
single.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Richard then greeted Matt Anderson with a run-scoring
single. One out later, Lewis drew a bases-loaded walk.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo matched Mercedes through four innings before Baltimore
broke through in the fifth. Chris Richard drew a leadoff walk, got
to third with one out and scored on Lewis' single off the
right-field scoreboard. It was the Orioles' first run against Nomo
in 12 innings this year.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Easley was ejected in the eighth by umpire Scott Higgins
for arguing a called third strike. ... Orioles CF Luis Matos will
be out 3-5 days with a bruised left shoulder, an injury that
occurred during a play at first base Tuesday. ... Lewis was 5-for-5
in stolen base attempts before being cut down in the fifth. ...
Belle is 5-for-8 with 12 RBIs with the bases loaded. It was his
first multiple-RBI game since Aug. 12.

<HEADLINE> Suharto's Trial Attendance Unsure  </HEADLINE>
By GEOFF SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Ex-President Suharto is too ill to
attend the opening of his corruption trial Thursday, one of the
former dictator's lawyers said following a medical exam.
</P>
<P>
   Security concerns surrounding the trial were heightened when a
small bomb exploded late Wednesday inside an empty bus less that
300 yards from the venue of the hearing. No one was injured and
damage was minimal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not possible,'' said Denny Kailimang, a member of the
eight-man defense team, replying to a question on whether Suharto
would go to court. He declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Kailimang's comments came after a medical team that had been
examining Suharto left his central Jakarta residence in a four-car
convoy.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's lawyers claim that 2&AMP;frac12; years after student protesters
dislodged him from power, Suharto, 79, has become a frail old man,
brain-damaged by strokes and unable to understand simple questions.
</P>
<P>
   But Indonesian Attorney General Marzuki Darusman said the former
leader must attend and that recent medical tests, including brain
scans, by state doctors say that he can.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prosecutors will do all they can to bring Suharto before
the court for the opening session,'' Darusman said.
</P>
<P>
   If Suharto doesn't come to court Thursday, a panel of judges
that is deciding the case is expected to order government
physicians to examine him before deciding how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto is charged with stealing $583 million of state funds,
according to a copy of the indictment obtained by The Associated
Press. He had denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is seen as a key test of Indonesia's determination to
stamp out corruption and deal with the excesses of decades of
authoritarian rule. President Abdurrahman Wahid, however, has said
he will pardon Suharto if he returns ill-gotten wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The 45-page indictment alleges that Suharto enriched himself,
his family and cronies with state money through tax-free charitable
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment alleges Suharto, who ruled the world's fourth
most populous nation with an iron hand for 32 years, issued
presidential decrees to pilfer the public purse.
</P>
<P>
   It alleges he skimmed 2 percent of the country's income tax
revenue, took funds from sales taxes and snatched a percentage from
the monthly paychecks of civil servants and military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,200 police are guarding the Agriculture Ministry,
where the trial is to be held in a converted conference room able
to hold hundreds of spectators and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Judges and prosecutors have been assigned bodyguards and bomb
squads are on standby.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Wednesday night's blast, which damaged the interior
of the bus, was a message to the trial's participants.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an act of terror to intimidate people before the trial
starts,'' Jakarta's chief detective, Col. Hari Montolalu, said.
</P>
<P>
   Some students complain the charges against Suharto are not broad
enough -- that he stole billions not just millions and that he
should also be prosecuted for human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is excellent that he is being forced to stand
trial,'' said Gina Ariyani, 23, a college student. ''But his people
are playing games and attempting to destabilize the country. They
still have power and money.''

<HEADLINE> BoSox's Fassero Sent to Bullpen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Boston Red Sox manager Jimy Williams
has reworked his starting rotation for the second time in three
days, sending Jeff Fassero to the bullpen and replacing him with
Pete Schourek.
</P>
<P>
   The move was announced after Fassero allowed three runs and
eight hits in 3 1-3 innings of the Red Sox's 3-1 loss Wednesday
night to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   ''Manager's decision,'' Williams said. ''So Fassero will have to
help us out of the bullpen, which I really think he can as a
left-hander.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero, who complained after being pulled in the sixth inning
of his previous outing Friday at Kansas City, declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek, currently on the 15-day disabled list with left
shoulder soreness, threw in the bullpen before Wednesday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy to be starting,'' Schourek said. ''I've got a lot of
confidence. I like the way I'm throwing. I had a good side session
today. As far as pain and discomfort, it's at a minimum right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams dropped Tim Wakefield from the rotation Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not look at this as a demotion,'' Williams said. ''We
have more veteran pitchers in our bullpen. I think that makes us
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield's replacement, Ramon Martinez, is scheduled to start
Saturday against Seattle.

<HEADLINE> Cheney Laments State of Military  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Dick Cheney said Wednesday a military made strong
in the 1980s by GOP-led defense spending is now low on morale,
weapons and soldiers because of ''eight years of neglect and
misplaced priorities'' by the Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, the former defense secretary and now GOP vice
presidential candidate, said troops that were victorious in the
Persian Gulf War have been hurt by spending cuts that have gone
''far beyond any careful weighing of the national interest.''
</P>
<P>
   ''A commander in chief leads the military built by those who
came before him,'' he said in a speech to the Southern Center on
International Studies. ''That is why we were able to win the Gulf
War -- because we were commanding a military rebuilt in the 1980s,''
said Cheney, who was defense secretary under President Bush during
the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   The speech came one week after Cheney was called on to defend
the military cuts that he had overseen as Pentagon chief, many of
them related to the end of the Cold War. Cheney said Wednesday he
cut ''what was no longer needed and nothing more.''
</P>
<P>
   The military budget began dropping after 1985, the high point
under President Reagan. It continued to decline under the Bush
administration and through most of the Clinton administration,
although it has been up in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential candidate,
responded to Cheney's speech by pointing out recent budget boosts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the strongest military in the world and we reversed
the decline of the Bush-Quayle years,'' Gore told reporters as he
was flying to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said the buildup under Reagan enabled President Clinton
and Gore to send troops on overseas deployments, missions he said
have left them stretched to the limits. He said today's military is
''still the most formidable in the world'' but is woefully
underfunded, putting troops at higher risk if the country were to
have to fight wars.
</P>
<P>
   If elected, George W. Bush will review overseas deployments, pay
soldiers more, improve schools for soldiers' children and keep the
''faith with our veterans ... treating them with dignity and ...
earning their trust in return,'' Cheney said, drawing applause.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Gen. Colin Powell, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff during the Bush administration, supported Cheney's
observations on the state of the military.
</P>
<P>
   ''Readiness has declined, investment has declined, maintenance
has declined, training has declined,'' said Powell, who serves as
an informal adviser to Bush on military matters and is widely
viewed as a likely secretary of state in a Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign accused Cheney of twisting the facts and said
Gore wants to use part of the budget surplus for defense, while
Bush wants it for tax cuts that will benefit the wealthy
</P>
<P>
   ''By twisting facts about our military for partisan gain,
Governor Bush has demonstrated that he is not ready to be America's
commander in chief,'' said spokeswoman Kym Spell.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Gore want to spend more on defense. Gore has
proposed a 10-year, $127 billion defense package that includes the
3.7 percent military pay increase enacted this year, investments to
modernize equipment and more funding for veterans hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has proposed $1 billion a year more for military pay over
the next five years and $310 million to fix schools on military
bases.
</P>
<P>
   In his earlier speech, Cheney quoted ''one observer'' as saying.
''Our military faces readiness problems.'' That observer, he said,
was Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, Gore's vice presidential
running mate, a statement that sent a murmur running through the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign accused Cheney of taking Lieberman's words out
of context. They provided the text of the Feb. 24, 1999 speech in
which, after citing readiness problems, Lieberman immediately
added, ''The Department of Defense deserves credit for highlighting
these problems. The administration deserves credit for increasing
the budget to address them. And our colleagues who have crafted
this bill deserve credit for bringing these issues into clear
focus.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign also cited a Lieberman speech three months
later, in which the senator said he was ''pleased and proud that we
reversed the 14 years of declining defense dollars and added the
money to readiness and procurement to fix the most urgent,
near-term readiness problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is just the latest regrettable incident of the Bush
campaign resorting to false and negative attacks,'' said Gore
spokesman Mark Fabiani.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss said Lieberman's full
remarks did not absolve the administration of the fact that
problems existed for years under Clinton-Gore. ''He's saying that
the problem still exists. He's giving the administration credit for
finally addressing the problem, and that is not leadership by any
measure,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Rebels Release 5 Captives  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- A Sierra Leone rebel faction on
Wednesday released five British soldiers held captive in the
country's jungle interior since last week, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The troops were ''in British hands and on their way towards
Freetown,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Tony Cramp, the British forces
spokesman. ''They were all in very good condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Six others were still believed held by the small rebel group,
known as the West Side Boys, and their status was not immediately
clear.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are delighted with this development but obviously our
thoughts and concerns still remain with those being held,'' Cramp
said. ''Talks are continuing and we hope for early release of the
remainder.''
</P>
<P>
   Cramp declined to reveal details of where and how the five were
released or whether a deal had been struck with the captors.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still have others in detention,'' Cramp said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the British military force and the U.N.
peacekeeping mission to this West African country have been in
radio contact with the captive soldiers as well as with leaders of
the West Side Boys. There have also been face-to-face talks, the
British Ministry of Defense has said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, a British Foreign Office
spokesman said Wednesday the five were released with the help of
the U.N. and specifically the Jordanian contingent of Sierra
Leone's U.N. peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations for the release of the other hostages would
continue first thing in the morning, the Foreign Office spokesman
added.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers, members of the 1st Irish Regiment, were stationed
at Benguema, about 25 miles east of Freetown, where British
instructors are training Sierra Leonean army recruits under a
bilateral agreement.
</P>
<P>
   They disappeared Friday in an area occupied by the West Side
Boys, who have fought with both the government and the rebels in
this war-ravaged country. In recent weeks, the West Side Boys --
known for their brutality and ill-discipline -- have broken away
again from the Sierra Leone army and appear to be acting on their
own.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone's main rebel group, the Revolutionary United Front,
reignited the West African country's nine-year civil war in May by
seizing about 500 U.N. peacekeepers and keeping 233 others
surrounded for 2-&AMP;frac12; months. The move embarrassed the United Nations
and prompted a reassessment of the U.N. mission here.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Britain circulated a draft resolution at the United
Nations Wednesday to increase the 13,000-strong U.N. peacekeeping
force in Sierra Leone to 20,500.
</P>
<P>
   The draft parallels recommendations made last week by
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and, once adopted, would signal a
major new commitment by the Security Council to reassert U.N.
authority in Sierra Leone following the embarrassing seizure of 500
U.N. peacekeepers by rebels in May.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution is expected to be in negotiation for several
weeks -- primarily because the United States needs to give Congress
at least two weeks notice before signing off on any costly increase
in peacekeeping forces.

<HEADLINE> Autopsy: Ark. Student Shot Teacher  </HEADLINE>
By MELISSA NELSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A student who had just been dropped
from a graduate program bought a box of bullets less than an hour
before walking into his adviser's office at the University of
Arkansas, shooting him three times and killing himself, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsy results released Wednesday determined that James Easton
Kelly killed English professor John Locke on Monday and then shot
himself in the heart.
</P>
<P>
   A receipt for a 50-round box of ammunition was discovered
Wednesday in Kelly's rental car, parked near the English
department's offices.
</P>
<P>
   The receipt was stamped 11:27 a.m. by a Wal-Mart 10 miles from
the Fayetteville campus. Police were summoned to Kimpel Hall at
12:14 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''He went immediately to campus,'' university police Chief Larry
Slamons said.
</P>
<P>
   Slamons said the bullets purchased at that Wal-Mart were the
same ones used in Kelly's .38-caliber revolver and the same bullets
that killed Locke. An attache case found in the office contained
the rest of the bullets and 46 additional rounds, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't say whether other professors could have been
targets.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot speculate at this time about the other professors,''
Slamons said. ''He had the ammunition. In the event he had left
that building, it would have been available to him.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the car rental records, Kelly rented the car on
Aug. 21, the same day he was notified of the graduate school's
decision to dismiss him. Kelly had been taking graduate classes at
the university for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Locke, Kelly's adviser, was also chairman of the committee that
voted to deny his reinstatement to the comparative literature
program. Locke abstained from the vote, but he likely was the one
who notified Kelly of the decision, Slamons said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was the most visible and he was giving him the bad news,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's meeting between Locke and Kelly wasn't listed in the
professor's appointment book, and Locke had previously told a
colleague that he was apprehensive about meeting with Kelly in
private.
</P>
<P>
   In the attache case found after the shootings, police discovered
five letters addressed to Kelly -- including the one telling him he
could no longer take classes for credit toward an advanced degree.
</P>
<P>
   English professor Brian Wilkie said Kelly had been dismissed
from the graduate program because he was not making satisfactory
progress toward his doctorate.
</P>
<P>
   The university said Kelly had enrolled in, then dropped, English
department classes several times over the past three years. He was
enrolled as a non-degree student for the fall semester.
</P>
<P>
   After the first shot rang out in Kimpel Hall on Monday, graduate
student Bethany Edstrom said she heard someone say: ''I didn't do
anything.'' Slamons said the shot through Locke's hand indicated he
raised his arm in a futile attempt to defend himself, Slamons said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers responding to at least three 911 calls said a man
behind Locke's office door said he had been hurt but that they
shouldn't enter. Slamons said the Locke and Kelly may have
struggled, with Locke perhaps landing a blow before being fatally
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, they heard Kelly kill himself with the final of
four shots. Two bullets remained in the revolver when officers
finally entered the cluttered office, Slamons said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Kelly had no criminal record and there was no
indication of discipline problems on his university record.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 7, Expos 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- The Arizona Diamondbacks gave Randy Johnson
plenty of offensive support.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson pitched a five-hitter to win his 17th game and
Steve Finley homered twice to lead the Arizona Diamondbacks to a
7-0 win over the Montreal Expos on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson (17-5), coming off his first no-strikeout game in 11
years, struck out 10 in his third shutout of the season and 28th of
his career.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt like every time I got our offense back out there, we
were able to get a few more runs,'' Johnson said. ''As a starting
pitcher, when you go out there and get runs, it's a lot easier to
go out there and feel like you can make a mistake, if it should be
made.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also pitched shutouts in a 1-0 win over Pittsburgh on
April 9 and a 6-0 win in Chicago on April 30.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew we were in trouble after he threw the first fastball
tonight,'' Expos manager Felipe Alou said. ''Some of the young guys
really struggled out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley hit a two-run homer off Felipe Lira (3-5) to cap a
four-run first. He added a solo homer in the fifth -- his 33rd -- for
his third two-homer game of the season, the 17th multihomer game of
his career.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Johnson) had a rough outing his last start,'' Finley said.
''He doesn't have too many of those a year, so he came back tonight
and redeemed himself and pitched a great ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis Gonzalez hit his career-best 27th homer homered leading off
the third to put Arizona ahead 5-0. Gonzalez hit 26 homers last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Lira allowed seven hits and five runs in 2 1-3 innings as the
Expos lost for the 16th time in their last 20 games to finish a 2-4
homestand.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm running out of explanations,'' Alou said.
</P>
<P>
   The win was Johnson's first in five starts against Montreal, the
team he made his major league debut with in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a very good team,'' Johnson said. ''I've watched them
the last two nights. They're a team that kind of lays low. When you
score a few runs on them, they come right back and string some hits
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson retired the first eight Expos he faced -- five on
strikeouts -- before reliever Mike Johnson lined a single to left
with two outs in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ''You give Randy Johnson one run in the first inning and you're
in trouble,'' Alou said. ''We gave him four so the game was decided
in the first inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Damian Miller's sacrifice fly in the sixth drove in Arizona's
seventh run.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Johnson has 2,981 career strikeouts. ... Finley's last
two-homer game was on May 2 at Milwaukee. ... 3B Matt Williams,
1-for-20 on the Diamondbacks' current road trip, didn't start.
Craig Counsell started at third base. ... The Expos lineup featured
five switch-hitters, the third time Montreal has had that many
switch-hitters in their batting order this season. The Expos had
Wilton Guerrero batting leadoff, Milton Bradley batting second,
Jose Vidro hitting third, Geoff Blum in the fifth spot and Fernando
Seguignol batting sixth.

<HEADLINE> Braves 5, Reds 2  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Braves went behind closed doors to
clear the air. When they emerged from the clubhouse, they looked
more like the team that has won eight straight division titles.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Glavine pitched a three-hitter to become the NL's first
18-game winner, Andres Galarraga hit a two-run homer and the Braves
ended a four-game losing streak with a 5-2 victory over the
Cincinnati Reds on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The victory ended the Braves' longest losing streak of the
season and kept them tied with New York for first in the NL East.
The Mets defeated Houston 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there was any urgency,'' Glavine said. ''But
there was probably a little more enthusiasm than we've had the last
couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   After batting practice, the clubhouse doors were closed and the
players held a rare private meeting to talk about their woes, which
included five losses on the first six games of the homestand and a
13-14 record in August.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes, it doesn't hurt to get in there and clear the
air,'' Glavine said. ''There's no problems. No one is mad at each
other. It's just that time of year where you've got to bear down.
You've got to overcome the fact that you're tired and overcome the
fact that you've got injuries. So does everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves manager Bobby Cox picked up his 1,600th victory, passing
Tommy Lasorda for 14th place on the career list.
</P>
<P>
   ''I forgot about it,'' Cox said. ''Someone said something about
wins as I was coming down the tunnel. I thought Tommy had done
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine (18-6) won for the 11th time in 12 starts -- including
four in a row -- as he closes in on the fifth 20-win season of his
career. The left-hander retired the last 11 hitters for his third
complete game of the season and 48th overall.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine has become the Atlanta stopper, going 8-1 when he's
pitched after the team lost. Five of those wins have come in
August, helping to prevent the Braves' slide from being more
pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a challenge,'' he said. ''Don't get me wrong. It's nice
knowing I can go out there after a loss and turn things around. But
for morale purposes, I'd much rather be pitching in the midst of a
winning streak rather than trying to stop a losing streak.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds knew they were facing a pitcher at the top of his game.
</P>
<P>
   ''You expect that kind of pitching from the Braves,'' manager
Jack McKeon said. ''He was outstanding. He mixed his speeds well.
He had good control. He stopped us cold.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves pounded Cincinnati starter Elmer Dessens (6-5) for 12
hits and five runs in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wasn't sharp with his location. He got the ball up,''
McKeon said. ''If he gets the ball up, he gets murdered. But at
least he kept us close.''
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones had an RBI double in the first and Javy Lopez led
off the second with his 22nd homer, putting the Braves ahead for
good. They put the game away in the fifth after Dessens retired the
first two hitters.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. Surhoff reached on an infield single and took an extra base
when second baseman Pokey Reese threw the ball into the dugout.
Galarraga followed with his 25th homer, an opposite-field drive to
the right-field bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga was stymied on his two previous at-bats. Reese made a
great diving stop on a grounder to end the first, then Surhoff was
thrown out at the plate to end the third after the Big Cat singled
to left-fielder Alex Ochoa.
</P>
<P>
   ''I needed a home run to get an RBI,'' Galarraga said with a
grin.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati scored on Juan Castro's RBI single in the second and
Dante Bichette's sacrifice fly in the sixth. Otherwise, the Reds
hardly touched Glavine, who retired the side in order six times.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves outhit Cincinnati 14-3.
</P>
<P>
   Former Atlanta closer Mark Wohlers made his first appearance at
Turner Field since he was dealt to Cincinnati in April 1999 with
his career in shambles because of control problems. He pitched two
scoreless innings and didn't walk anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a lot more confident than I thought I'd be,'' Wohlers
said. ''I still have a lot of friends here. I was just hoping to
get through it.''
</P>
<P>
Notes: Braves RF Brian Jordan sat out his second straight game
because of a sore right shoulder. Reggie Sanders started in his
place and made a nice diving catch on Ken Griffey Jr.'s liner to
end the third. ... Dessens was the first Cincinnati starter to lose
since April 20, when he took the defeat vs. Pittsburgh. In between
those losses, Cincinnati starters went 6-0 with a 2.85 ERA in nine
games. ... John Riedling, called up Monday when Scott Williamson
went on the disabled list, made his major league debut by pitching
a scoreless eighth.

<HEADLINE> Grant Sent To Heat, Kemp To Blazers  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Portland, Cleveland and Miami completed a
five-player deal Wednesday, with the Trail Blazers sending power
forward Brian Grant to the Heat and getting Shawn Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal, which has been known for weeks but
finally met league approval, Grant signed a seven-year, $86 million
deal with the Blazers. In exchange for Grant, the Heat sent Chris
Gatling and Clarence Weatherspoon, along with a first-round draft
choice and cash, to the Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland also gets Portland's 36-year-old backup point guard,
Gary Grant, who almost certainly will be cut.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp's weight problems, bloated contract and surly attitude made
him unwelcome in Cleveland. Kemp, who played for Seattle when
Blazers general manager Bob Whitsitt was there, is due to make $71
million in the next four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's had a great career and still has good games in him,''
Whitsitt said. ''He'll do what is needed of him to win. He's not a
statistics guy. He's done that.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's done everything a guy can do in the NBA, but win a
championship. He's hungry for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland guard Steve Smith, practicing with the U.S. Olympic
team in Hawaii, said the 6-foot-10 Kemp will be a big help guarding
the Los Angeles Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got so many guys. We're the other Dream Team,'' Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Grant was slowed by knee and foot injuries last season
when he averaged career lows of 21 minutes, 7.3 points and 5.5
rebounds. One of the league's most emotional players and fiercest
rebounders, he also was frustrated by giving up the spotlight to
Rasheed Wallace, who had a breakout season playing the same
position.
</P>
<P>
   ''Brian wanted to make sure he was playing for a team that had a
chance to win a championship, a team where he would play a major
role and he would be the starting power forward, with a great coach
and a terrific city,'' said Mark Bartelstein, Brian Grant's agent.
''Miami has all that covered and more.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got a lot to prove, and he's looking forward to proving
it. He's got a lot of pride, and it hurt him to go through what he
went through last season.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant had been courted by the New York Knicks and Cleveland, but
Miami could offer the kind of raise he was looking for. He made
about $7.7 million with the Blazers last season. The Los Angeles
Lakers also were interested, but the most they could afford was the
$2.25 million exception.
</P>
<P>
   When Miami traded its own power forward, P.J. Brown, to
Charlotte for Eddie Jones, it opened the door for Grant.
Bartelstein also represents Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The deal gives the Heat an imposing front line that also has
Alonzo Mourning and Anthony Mason, and puts coach Pat Riley in his
best position to make it back to the NBA Finals since he's been in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks fabulous on paper, looks like we're going to come out
of the East, but I've seen some of the most talented teams not win
anything,'' Mourning said. ''Look at Portland: The last time they
won it was when Bill Walton was there. There's always a lot of
talent there, but they never win. So talent alone won't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kemp, who joins a Portland team that nearly beat the eventual
NBA champion Lakers in the Western Conference finals, signed a
seven-year, $98 million contract after coming to the Cavs in a
three-way trade in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whenever you're considering trading, every factor comes into
it,'' Cavaliers general manager Jim Paxson said. ''To say strictly
done for financial reasons, no. Strictly done for the weight
reasons -- everything factors in.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of the back end of his (Kemp's) contract, the
flexibility of being able to do anything to improve this team was
greatly limited. So in the short term we have depth, we have a lot
of players fighting for time and positions, and in the long term we
have some flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers are hoping a return to the Pacific Northwest will
motivate Kemp. He has reported to training camp 50 pounds
overweight the past two seasons in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The added weight grounded Kemp, who used to be one of the most
ferocious dunkers in the league. Too often last season he was
forced to adjust his shot or just had it blocked. He finished the
season averaging 17.8 points -- his lowest total since 1992-93-- and
with a career-low 41.7 field-goal percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, I expect him to be in shape to play, and I know he
will,'' Whitsitt said. ''If you look at what he did last year, you
have to be an athlete in good shape to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kemp also was a liability on the defensive end, leading the
league in personal fouls and finishing third in turnovers -- a
remarkable stat for a frontline player.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old forward was a bigger headache off the court. He
regularly arrived late for home games, team meetings and flights,
failing to be the type of role model the Cavs wanted their young
players to learn from.
</P>
<P>
   Gatling, who came to Miami in a pre-draft trade with Denver, who
has one year left on a contract that will pay him $5.4 million this
season. He averaged 11.9 points and 5.9 rebounds in 85 games last
season with Orlando and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Weatherspoon averaged 7.2 points for Miami. Gary Grant played in
just three games last season for Portland.

<HEADLINE> Rockies 5, Phillies 4, 11 Innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Rookie Ben Petrick hit a solo homer in the
11th inning and the Colorado Rockies, helped by Todd Helton's
three-run double, beat the Philadelphia Phillies 5-4 Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Helton went 1-for-4 with a walk. His batting average dropped a
point to .395.
</P>
<P>
   Petrick connected with two outs for his third homer of the
season off Wayne Gomes (4-6).
</P>
<P>
   Gabe White (9-1) pitched two innings, allowing one hit, to pick
up the win. Jose Jimenez got three outs for his 18th save in 24
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Rockies manager Buddy Bell was back in the dugout after serving
a two-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Glanville had four hits and drove in two runs for
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado rallied from a 4-1 deficit in the sixth inning against
starter Kent Bottenfield. He had retired 15 of 16 batters in the
first five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Petrick led off the sixth with a walk and Jeff Frye and Juan
Pierre followed with singles, loading the bases. After Neifi Perez
struck out, Helton delivered a double to the left-center field gap
to tie it at 4.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Abreu hit a two-run homer, his 22nd, off starter Julian
Tavarez in the third inning as the Phillies took a 2-1 lead. It was
Abreu's fourth homer in four games.
</P>
<P>
   Tavarez walked the bases loaded in the fourth and Glanville hit
a two-out, two-run single, padding the lead to 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield went seven innings, surrendering four hits and three
earned runs. Tavarez lasted five innings and issued a season-high
five walks.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado scored an unearned run to take a 1-0 lead in the
second. Todd Walker singled and advanced to third when Glanville
misplayed the ball in center for an error, and later scored on Jeff
Cirillo's groundout.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Phillies 3B Scott Rolen missed his second straight start
due to a sore back. ... Country music stars Faith Hill and Tim
McGraw were in attendance. Tug McGraw, Tim's father and the star
reliever on the Phillies' 1980 World Series championship team, was
inducted into the Philadelphia Wall of Fame before the game. ...
Glanville made a great leaping catch against the wall to rob
Jeffrey Hammonds of extra bases in the sixth. ... Pat Burrell
struck out with the bases loaded in the Phillies sixth, dropping
his average to .778 (7-for-9) with the bases full. ... Hammonds was
ejected by plate umpire Rob Drake in the 10th inning for arguing a
called third strike.

<HEADLINE> Mariners Lose Olerud for the Night  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Mariners first baseman John Olerud missed
Seattle's game against the New York Yankees on Wednesday night
because his wife, Kelly, gave birth to have the couple's second
child, a girl.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan Marie Olerud weighed in at 7 pounds, 1 ounce.
</P>
<P>
   With Olerud absent, manager Lou Piniella started Raul Ibanez at
first. Piniella said he expected Olerud, the only Mariners' player
to play in all of the team's first 132 games, to rejoin the team
Friday in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, Mariners left fielder Rickey Henderson was
forced to leave because of lower back spasms.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners expect to have right fielder Jay Buhner back for
the Boston series this weekend. Buhner, who has been on the 15-day
disabled list with a sprained right wrist and right pinky finger,
is back taking batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully, we'll get Jay off the DL Friday,'' Piniella said.
''He's about 80 percent improved. Our plans are tentatively to have
him back this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Gil Meche, who made 15 starts for Seattle this
season, visited Dr. James Andrews, an orthopedic specialist, in
Birmingham, Ala., this week and was advised to rest for six weeks,
Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dr. Andrews said there was nothing wrong with him,'' Piniella
said. ''The doctor seems to think rest is the answer. Total rest.
No throwing at all. That's good news.''
</P>
<P>
   Meche came out of a rehabilitation start at Class A Everett
after one inning Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Meche, 21, was supposed to be a mainstay in the Mariners'
rotation this season, but has been limited to 15 starts. He has
been on the disabled list twice this season with a strained right
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Meche made his last start for the Mariners July 4 in Anaheim,
going 5 2-3 innings in a 7-6 loss. He was put on the DL July 31.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella had hoped to add him to his rotation in September.

   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Richie Sexson hit a game-winning single in the
bottom of the ninth inning as the Milwaukee Brewers snapped a
three-game losing streak with a 3-2 win over the Los Angeles
Dodgers on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Adams (6-7) gave up a bloop single to Geoff Jenkins
leading off the ninth. Shortstop Alex Cora raced out to get the
ball in short left field and threw wildly over the head off second
baseman Mark Grudzielanek, allowing Jenkins to go to second on
Cora's error.
</P>
<P>
   Sexson followed with a line-drive single to center, scoring the
winning run.
</P>
<P>
   Ray King (1-1) earned his first major league win by pitching a
perfect ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers starter Darren Dreifort allowed four hits and two runs
in eight innings. He walked one and struck out a career-high 11.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort allowed solo homers to Jenkins in the first and Tyler
Houston in the fifth as Milwaukee took a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Brewers starter Jamey Wright allowed two runs, six hits and
seven walks in eight innings. Wright has not won since July 28,
when he defeated Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Wright walked Tom Goodwin, Grudzielanek and Shawn Green to open
the first. Eric Karros followed with a sacrifice fly. After a
groundout put runners on second and third, Adrian Beltre hit a
grounder toward shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   The ball hit Green as he was running to third and second base
umpire Jeff Kellogg called him out. Beltre was credited with a
single.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' tied the score at 2 in the sixth inning on an RBI
double by Jim Leyritz.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Karros' sacrifice fly in the first was his team-leading
ninth of the season. ... Jenkins is tied with Jeromy Burnitz with a
team-leading 24 homers. ... Wright's double in the third was his
first of the season and seventh of his career. ... Dreifort's
previous strikeout high was 10 on July 25, 1998 against Arizona.

<HEADLINE> Obese Kid Said at Risk With Parents  </HEADLINE>
By MARY PEREA
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE (AP) -- The parents of a 120-pound, 3-year-old girl
put her ''at grave risk'' by repeatedly feeding her solid foods
while she was on a doctor-ordered liquid diet, a social worker said
in court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Anamarie Martinez-Regino's parents say they lost custody of the
toddler last Friday because they couldn't control her weight. The
child is living in a foster home, and her parents were allowed to
visit her for an hour Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Adela Martinez and Miguel Regino said Wednesday their child has
been on a liquid diet since June 10, except for one time when a
relative accidentally fed her solid food.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said her daughter ''seemed to be doing OK'' during
their visit Wednesday. As her parents were getting ready to leave,
Anamarie ''started to (cry) but we said, 'We're going to see you
again,''' Martinez said. The mother said she was told her daughter
had lost 4 pounds since Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A social worker's affidavit for a custody order reviewed by The
Associated Press on Wednesday said Anamarie's doctor recommended
the child be removed because of life-threatening concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The parents admitted giving their daughter solid foods while she
was on a strict liquid diet limited to 550 calories a day, Liza
Perez said in the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Family attorney Troy Prichard said, ''There's obviously a lot of
factual allegations in that affidavit, some of them are true some
of them are not.''
</P>
<P>
   Anamarie was born April 11, 1997, and weighed 6 pounds, 13
ounces, the affidavit said. By March 31, 1998, she was 50 pounds, 9
ounces, and her height was 33 inches. She was placed on a diet and
referred to endocrinologists.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1999, she weighed 97 pounds and slept sitting up
because she was unable to breathe while lying down, the affidavit
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time she was taken, she weighed 120 pounds and was 3&AMP;frac12;
feet tall -- three times heavier and 50 percent taller than an
average 3-year-old, according to the girl's physician.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit says Anamarie has been tested for a variety of
conditions but doesn't specify the cause of the weight gain. Her
family says the problem has medical roots and is not caused by
overeating or bad nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   A custody hearing is scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Hartz, the head of New Mexico's Department of Children,
Youth and Families, said she could not comment specifically on the
case. But she said the department removes children from their
parents only when abuse and neglect are involved.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main issue is not weight, the main issue is safety,'' she
said. ''That's all we would be concerned about.''

<HEADLINE> Orioles Send Parrish to Rochester  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles optioned slumping rookie
left-hander John Parrish to Triple-A Rochester on Wednesday night
and activated reliever Alan Mills off the 15-day disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish (2-3) started off well with the Orioles after being
recalled from Rochester on July 24, but was shelled in his last two
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a loss to Chicago in which he walked five and gave up
five runs in 1 2-3 innings, Parrish was touched for six runs in 2
1-3 innings Tuesday night in a 12-2 loss to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   He threw 68 pitches, half of them outside the strike zone, and
walked off the mound with a 6.23 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a chance for him to catch his breath,'' said manager
Mike Hargrove, who announced the move after the Orioles' 5-1
victory over Detroit. ''This gets him out a pressure situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Parrish will pitch Sunday for the Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   ''For lack of a better term, it's a tuneup,'' Hargrove said.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Jay Spurgeon will take Parrish's place in the Orioles'
rotation and start Sunday in Cleveland, Hargrove said.
</P>
<P>
   In his debut with the Orioles last month, Parrish had nine
strikeouts in seven innings against the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   In his next start, the left-hander allowed only four hits in six
innings against Cleveland to earn his first major league victory.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a month later, Parrish is looking like a 22-year-old rookie
who never pitched above the Double-A level before this season.
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what he is.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think John is a 22-year-old pitcher, and sometimes he
pitches like a 22-year-old pitcher,'' Hargrove said before
Wednesday's game. ''He's got good stuff, and he needs to learn how
to trust that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Parrish will rejoin the Orioles in Minnesota on Tuesday,
Hargrove said.
</P>
<P>
   Mills has been sidelined since Aug. 4 with inflammation in his
right shoulder.

Indians-Rangers:
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: Jim Thome entered Wednesday night 228 career homers,
all with the Indians, No. 2 in club history behind Albert Belle's
242. ... The Indians completed a July 28 trade with Milwaukee by
sending minor league second baseman Marcos Scutaro to the Brewers.
Scutaro hit .275 with five homers and 54 RBIs in 124 games for
Triple-A Buffalo this season.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: All-Star C Ivan Rodriguez returned from in Puerto Rico to
have his broken right thumb examined by team Dr. Bobby Wroten.
Wroten said the thumb is healing normally. Rodriguez is wearing a
cast that extends from his thumb to past his wrist, but expects to
have a splint in two weeks. ''It's healing but it's still weak,''
Rodriguez said. Team medical personnel still estimates it will take
3-5 months for the thumb to heal. Rodriguez sustained the injury on
July 24. ... LHP Darren Oliver will make his fifth and final rehab
start with the Rangers' Triple-A Oklahoma affiliate on Thursday.
Oliver has been on the DL since July 31 with weakness in his left
shoulder.
Red Sox-Devil Rays
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: 1B Brian Daubach returned to Boston after hyperextending
his left elbow during Tuesday's bench-clearing brawl. ''It's not
fractured, that's all I know,'' Daubach said. He will undergo
additional tests in Boston. ... 3B Lou Merloni was released from a
hospital after undergoing observation for a concussion he received
during the first-inning brawl. ''I feel all right now. I've just
got a headache and a real stiff neck,'' Merloni said. ''It's no big
deal.'' ... The Red Sox were greeted by the song Kung Fu Fighting
when they started batting practice. Other BP musical selections
included Macho Man and See You in September. The Red Sox close out
the regular season Sept. 29-Oct. 1 at Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: The Devil Rays sent a tape of Tuesday's first-inning
brawl to the commissioner's office. After the game, the Devil Rays
accused Boston 1B Brian Daubach of throwing sucker punches in the
pile. ''Brian Daubach did not conduct himself in a professional
manner,'' Tampa Bay general manager Chuck LaMar said. ''The action
of Mr. Daubach led to most of the ejections.'' Tampa Bay had five
players, two coaches -- who were serving an acting managers -- and
manager Larry Rothschild all ejected. ... It was just the second
time in major league history one team had three managers ejected in
one game. The other occurred on Aug. 12, 1984, when San Diego
manager Dick Williams, along with acting managers, coaches Ozzie
Virgil and Jack Kroll were thrown out. Current Yankees' manager,
then Atlanta skipper, Joe Torre was also ejected. It appears
Tuesday was the first time one team had eight ejections while their
opponent had none. ... LF Greg Vaughn, who has been limited to DH
duties since Aug. 7, will have his ailing right shoulder examined
Friday. ... Tampa Bay extended its working agreement with
Charleston (S.C) of the South Atlantic League through 2004.
Tigers-Orioles:
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: LHP Steve Sparks has a 1.69 ERA in August, tops in the
AL for the month. ... OF Wendell Magee is 8-for-20 as a pinch
hitter. ... RHP Jeff Weaver's victory Tuesday was his ninth of the
year, matching the total he reached last year as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: OF Luis Matos will be sidelined for a few days with a
bruised left shoulder, an injury that occurred Tuesday night during
a play at first base. ... After Thursday's home game against
Detroit, the Orioles depart on their longest road trip of the year.
They will play 13 games in 13 days in four cities. ... Baltimore
relievers have only three blown saves since June 28.
Twins-Royals:
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: The Twins activated C Chad Moeller from the 15-day DL
and sending C Danny Ardoin to Triple-A Salt Lake City. The Twins
lost their last four of the season to the Royals and lost the
season series to Kansas City 7-5. Redman's ERA rose from 4.46 to
4.78.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: Sweeney reached the 100-RBI mark this season faster
than anyone else in team history. Another team record in jeopardy
is Steve Balboni's 36 home runs, set in 1985. Jermaine Dye is at 31
with 30 games to go. ... Jerry Spradlin was released a few minutes
after giving up three runs and not recording an out in the ninth
inning of the Royals' 8-7 victory. He was replaced by LHP Scott
Mullen, whose contract was purchased from Triple-A Omaha.
White Sox-Athletics:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: RHP Jon Garland, sidelined since Aug. 18 when a line
drive struck him just below his right elbow at Tampa Bay, was
impressive in a rehab start at Double-A Birmingham. Garland struck
out 10 in six shutout innings, giving up four hits and one walk
Wednesday. ... Also with Birmingham, Olympics-bound pitcher Jon
Rauch threw a two-hitter Tuesday in a 2-0 win over Huntsville.
Rauch is 4-0 with a 1.50 ERA over his last five starts, recording
42 strikeouts in 36 innings. Rauch, 21, will join the U.S. baseball
team on Sept. 2 to began preparation for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: 1B Jason Giambi had a cortisone shot in his sore left
shoulder after Wednesday's game and is expected to miss Friday
night's opener of a three-game series at Toronto. ... Oakland sent
RHP Jon Ratliff back to Triple-A Sacramento and called up 1B Mario
Valdez. Ratliff spent four days with the Athletics and did not make
an appearance. ... SS Miguel Tejada had 62 pairs of spikes around
his locker before one game this week, but not to keep him stocked
up. Tejada has the shoes shipped back to his native Dominican
Republic for children who can't afford spikes.
Blue Jays-Angels:
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: David Wells, going for his major league-leading 19th
victory Wednesday, has a shot at his first 20-win season. Pitching
coach and assistant GM Dave Stewart, the last major leaguer with
four consecutive 20-win seasons, has enjoyed watching Wells go
after his first one. ''Winning 20 is not easy,'' Stewart said. ''It
takes maturity, it takes skill and it takes luck -- being in the
right place at the right time. But for Boomer, the time is right.''
... The Blue Jays, vying for their first postseason appearance
since winning the 1993 World Series, will play 26 of their final 33
games against teams with a realistic shot at a division title or
wild card berth. ''With our schedule, we've got to face all the
first-place teams and all the wild card teams we're up against. So
for us, every game is a playoff game,'' reliever John Frascatore
said. ... Toronto needed five home runs to break the club record of
221, set in 1998. ... Leadoff hitter Shannon Stewart has hit safely
in 21 of 23 games and is hitting .398 over that span, raising his
average to .341.
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: The Angels' who led the majors with 41 home wins
entering Wednesday, play only nine of their final 29 games at
Edison Field. But that doesn't bother rookie manager Mike Scioscia,
whose team is seven games under .500 away from home. ''This club is
playing consistently right now and doing the things we're capable
of doing, so it doesn't matter where we're playing,'' Scioscia
said. ''Just because we're going to be on the road, it doesn't mean
that there's some kind of intimidation factor where we don't have
the confidence to win those games.'' ... Tim Belcher will make
another rehab start Friday at Class-A Lake Elsinore, and is cleared
to make 100 pitches. But whenever he is activated, he will have to
serve a three-game suspension stemming from his June 27 ejection by
plate umpire Mike DiMuro. Belcher had a heated argument with DiMuro
after a balk was called against him that allowed a run to score in
the Angels' 5-3 loss at Seattle. ... The Angels claimed RHP Ben
Weber off waivers from San Francisco's Triple-A Fresno club, then
assigned him to Triple-A Edmonton.
Yankees-Mariners:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: 2B Chuck Knoblauch's sore elbow might sideline him for
the remainder of the season. ''Our plan has to be that we're not
going to have him,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ''To start
counting on him isn't healthy for me. There's been no improvement
in his elbow.'' Knoblauch has been on the DL since Aug. 3 because
of tendinitis in his right elbow. Knoblauch is in Tampa, Fla., on a
rehabilitation assignment. ... RF Paul O'Neill was back in the
Yankees' lineup after missing six straight games with a right hip
pointer. ''It feels better every day,'' O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: 1B John Olerud missed the game because his wife, Kelly,
gave birth to have the couple's second child, a girl. Jordan Marie
Olerud weighed in at 7 pounds, 1 ounce. With Olerud absent, manager
Lou Piniella started Raul Ibanez at 1B. ... In the first inning, LF
Rickey Henderson was forced to leave because of lower back spasms.
... The Mariners expect to have RF Jay Buhner back for the Boston
series this weekend.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Padres-Cubs:
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: RHP Donne Wall has a sore shoulder which acted up
after he threw one inning Tuesday. His status was day to day. ...
3B Phil Nevin's streak of games in which he reached base via a hit
or a walk ended at 49. ... RHP Brian Tollberg has walked two or
less batters in 10 of his 14 starts. He had not allowed a run in 10
innings but the Cubs ended that streak with a run in the first. The
team season high was 11 innings set by Adam Eaton. ... The Padres
are 26-19 since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Manager Don Baylor and some of his coaches took part in
a clinic at 9 a.m. Wednesday despite playing a 4-hour, 48 minute
game the night before that ended just before midnight. ''In this
game, you learn to sleep fast,'' Baylor said. ... Because of the
lateness of Tuesday's game, 1B Mark Grace said he didn't get a
chance to talk to his agent Barry Axelrod about contract
discussions with the Cubs. Grace will be a free agent at season's
end. ... SS Ricky Gutierrez is nursing a sore quadriceps but was
expected to return to the starting lineup Thursday. ... RF Sammy
Sosa posted his first Wrigley Field multihomer game since Aug. 21
last year. In 69 games at Wrigley, Sosa has 20 home runs. He has
hit 25 in 63 road games.
Cardinals-Marlins:
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: OF Jim Edmonds returned to the lineup after getting a
day off Tuesday. Edmonds, whose average dipped below .300 for the
first time since opening day, was in an 0-for-19 slump and batting
just .220 since Mark McGwire left the lineup July 6. ... The Cards
play 17 of their remaining 29 games at home.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: OF Mark Kotsay, who fouled two balls off his shin
Tuesday and left in the eighth inning with a bad bruise, did not
start Wednesday's game: ''If he had start, he could. I just didn't
think he would be able to walk today,'' manager John Boles said.
... Rookie RHP Chuck Smith (3-5, 3.55 ERA) has left quite an
impression on the Marlins, especially after giving up four hits and
one run in eight innings against St. Louis: ''Next year, without
any additions or subtractions, he's our No. 3 starter. ... SS Alex
Gonzalez, on the DL since July 28 with a sprained knee, will be
recalled Friday. RHP Brad Penny and Chris Clapinski will be
recalled Saturday and Monday, respectfully.
Diamondbacks-Expos:
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: 3B Matt Williams, 1-for-20 on the road trip, didn't
start. Craig Counsell started at third base. ... The Expos are the
only team that Randy Johnson has faced and yet to win against.
Johnson is 0-2 in four career starts against Montreal. Johnson, who
made his major league debut with Montreal in 1988, has never
pitched against the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: The Expos lineup featured five switch-hitters, the
third time Montreal has had that many switch-hitters in their
batting order this season. The Expos, who also had five
switch-hitters face Johnson on Aug. 9, had switch-hitters Wilton
Guerrero batting leadoff, Milton Bradley batting second, Jose Vidro
hitting third, Geoff Blum in the fifth spot and Fernando Seguignol
batting sixth.
Giants-Pirates:
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: The Giants' trip to Philadelphia and Pittsburgh
represents the third time this month they've crossed the country.
Adding to the challenge is a flu bug that's attacked the team. ''I
think about half the people in here are on medication,'' manager
Dusty Baker said. ... After two consecutive shutouts, Livan
Hernandez was pounded for seven hits in two innings by the Pirates
on Tuesday. Said C Bobby Estalella, ''He didn't have the stuff he
normally has and he got behind in the count a lot. He just hasn't
been hit like that -- not since spring training.'' ... Reliever Alan
Embree has been a second-half star for the Giants. Entering
Wednesday's game he was on a streak of 12 consecutive scoreless
appearances and had stranded 18 of the 19 runners he'd inherited in
that span. ''He's been awesome,'' Baker said. ''He's always been a
good second-half pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: Kris Benson was lifted after eight innings Tuesday
even though he was working on a one-hitter. Benson had just been
given extra rest between starts because of a tired arm and had
thrown 119 pitches in the game. To manager Gene Lamont, the move
was perfectly logical so he became upset when he was asked on
Wednesday if he thought about letting Benson finish. ''That's a
dumb question,'' Lamont said. ''If you ask that question, you don't
know anything about our team and what's been going on. If you ask
that question, you either don't know anything about baseball or
you're dumb.'' ... Kevin Young pulled a groin muscle Monday and
hasn't played since then. If the Sept. 1 roster expansion weren't
coming up this week, Young might be on the DL. The Pirates have
been using John Vander Wal at first base.
Astros-Mets:
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Tony Eusebio's 24-game hitting streak, which ended
Tuesday, matched the fifth-longest for a catcher since 1900,
trailing only Benito Santiago (34 games for San Diego in 1987),
Sandy Alomar Jr. (30 for Cleveland in 1997), John Flaherty (27 for
San Diego in 1996) and Brian Harper (25 for Minnesota in 1990).
Mike Piazza (Mets, 1999) and Gabby Hartnett (Cub, 1937) also had
24-gamers.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: LHP Al Leiter felt better Wednesday, manager Bobby
Valentine said, a day after the pitcher left after three innings
with a strained muscle in his right buttocks in an 11-1 loss to the
Astros. ... OF Derek Bell felt better, but was still a day or two
from playing. He did, however, laugh repeatedly while watching
''Judge Judy'' in the clubhouse before Wednesday's game. ... A day
after joining the Mets and pitching two innings in his major league
debut, RHP Jerrod Riggan was optioned to Binghamton of the Double-A
Eastern League. New York filled the spot by purchasing the contract
of OF Timoniel Perez from Norfolk of the Triple-A International
League.
Rockies-Phillies:
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Has Brent Mayne's pitching heroics rubbed off on other
Rockies? Before batting practice on Wednesday, 1B Todd Helton and
3B Jeff Cirillo were working on their windups while playing catch.
Cirillo used a conventional motion while Helton appeared to be
emulating LHP Mike Myers' swooping sidearm approach. Mayne, a
catcher, became the first position player to record a win in 32
years when he beat Atlanta on Aug. 22. ... Buddy Bell returned
after serving his two-game suspension. ... Colorado will play its
final 30 games on grass. ... Friday's starter Pedro Astacio (11-8,
5.15 ERA) has 186 strikeouts and is on pace for 226. He established
the club record of 210 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: Manager Terry Francona said he didn't even check
on 3B Scott Rolen's condition before deciding to sit him Wednesday.
''That decision was made before he even got to the clubhouse,''
Francona said. ''It's the best thing for him.'' Rolen is suffering
from a sore back and he believes the artificial turf has
re-aggravated the injury. He had played eight straight games on
turf before sitting out Tuesday. ... RHP Wayne Gomes and his wife,
Melissa, became parents of a son, Miles, on Tuesday. ... Tug McGraw
and Sam Chapman were inducted into the Philadelphia Wall of Fame.
McGraw won 49 games and saved 94, including the World Series
clincher in 1980 -- the Phillies lone championship in their 117-year
history. Chapman compiled 1,273 hits, 174 homers and 732 RBIs
during an 11-year career with the Philadelphia Athletics from
1938-41; 1945-51.
Reds-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: The Reds went into Wednesday having beaten the
Braves four times in a row, the first time that's happened since
1996. ... Cincinnati also clinched its first season series victory
over the Braves since 1990, when the Reds went 10-8 with their last
World Series-winning team. ... Juan Castro's run-scoring single in
the second inning assured the Reds of their 133rd consecutive game
without being shut out this season. The club record is 141 straight
games, which ended with last year's 5-0 loss to the New York Mets
in a one-game playoff to determine the NL wild card. ... Cincinnati
relievers had pitched 418 1-3 innings before Wednesday, most in the
majors.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: The Braves held a closed-door meeting in the clubhouse
after batting practice, perhaps to address the team's woes over the
past week. Atlanta came into Wednesday night's game having lost
four in a row and five of six on the current homestand, dropping
their record to 13-14 in August. ... RHP Kevin Millwood, who was
supposed to miss Thursday's scheduled start because of a broken
nose, will pitch against the Reds after all. Millwood broke his
nose and suffered a deviated septum when struck in the face by a
ball while bunting in the indoor batting cage prior to Monday's
game. ... 1B Andres Galarraga expects baseball to hear his appeal
in Atlanta sometime next week. Galarraga was suspended three games
for charging the mound against Colorado Aug. 22. Galarraga believes
the suspension should be reduced because he was provoked by Rockies
RHP John Wasdin. ''He got two days and I got three. Why?''
Galarraga asked. ''He started the fight.'' ... NASCAR Winston Cup
car owner Richard Childress attended the game as a guest of Braves
third-base coach Ned Yost, a rabid racing fan and close friend of
Childress and his star driver, Dale Earnhardt. Childress strolled
around the field during batting practice with two cameras, snapping
pictures like a awestruck fan.
Dodgers-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: Chan Ho Park's 14 strikeouts Tuesday were the most
by a Dodgers pitcher since Hideo Nomo struck out 17 Marlins in
April 1996. ''This year he's a complete pitcher,'' manager Davey
Johnson said. ''He was strictly a thrower last year. He overthrew a
lot. Now, when he's in a that groove, he can get good hitters out.
It gets like he's playing catch and it's fun to watch.'' ... The
Dodgers entered Wednesday with an 8-1 record without Gary
Sheffield, who is in L.A. recovering from the flu. ... The Dodgers,
who have 184 home runs this season, are on pace to hit a
club-record 226 homers. The record in L.A. is 191 in 1977 and the
franchise record is 208 in Brooklyn in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: Slumping 2B Ron Belliard (.262) wasn't in the
starting lineup Wednesday. He has a sore back that may require
offseason surgery. ''My understanding is that if he does have
surgery, he would be ready for spring training,'' manager Davey
Lopes said. ... INF Jose Hernandez, also with a bad back, is
completing a short rehab assignment in Triple-A Indianapolis and
may rejoin the Brewers on their road trip that starts Friday in
Colorado. ''If everything feels fine, he's available for our first
game in Colorado,'' Lopes said. ... The Brewers acquired INF Marcos
Scutero from Cleveland as the player to be named in the
seven-player deal July 28 that brought Richie Sexson to Milwaukee.
Scutero will report to Indianapolis on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Ivory Coast Junta Postpones Vote  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- Ivory Coast's military junta on
Wednesday postponed elections to restore civilian rule amid rising
tensions in one of Africa's most prosperous nations.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential ballot was originally scheduled for Sept. 17.
Information Ministry official Venance Konan said the military
regime decided to delay it until Oct. 22. A second round of voting,
if necessary, would follow in November, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons for the postponement were murky. Konan said the decision
was taken in part because of a shortage of funds and other
''problems affecting the work of the electoral commission.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivory Coast was considered a bastion of stability in volatile
West Africa before junta leader Gen. Robert Guei came to power in a
Dec. 24 coup d'etat that toppled the elected government of Henri
Konan Bedie.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover was initially popular among many Ivorians, who had
grown tired of corruption and ethnic favoritism under Bedie. But
many have become disillusioned with the new regime.
</P>
<P>
   Disgruntled soldiers have mutinied twice over bonuses and perks
they say they were promised for supporting the coup. Many believe
Guei's policies are fueling the same ethnic and political tensions
that divided the country under Bedie. There has also been no
improvement in the declining economy, which is one of the world's
largest cocoa and coffee producers.
</P>
<P>
   Konan says the vote was also delayed because the electoral body
needs time to assure the vote is carried out fairly and to register
18 to 21 year-olds who have only recently been granted voting
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''The international community needs to be assured that there is
fair play. If we had held the vote on Sept. 17, it could have
affected the credibility of the vote,'' he told The Associated
Press without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen candidates have applied, including Bedie and Guei, who
is standing as an independent candidate despite concerns about his
military position and influence.
</P>
<P>
   Both the United States and France, the country's former colonial
ruler, have discouraged Guei from running.
</P>
<P>
   The eligibility of a popular opposition leader, Alassane Dramane
Ouattara, is in question under a new constitution adopted following
a referendum in early August. A last-minute constitutional
amendment stipulates that both parents of presidential candidates
be ''of Ivorian origin'' -- a change widely believed to be aimed at
excluding Ouattara.
</P>
<P>
   Ouattara says both his parents were Ivorian. His opponents
insist they were from Burkina Faso. Ouattara is a former prime
minister and International Monetary Fund official who has been a
popular advocate for Ivory Coast's marginalized northern Muslims
and foreign immigrant community.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A grand jury has indicted a man suspected of
attacking several Asian women in Chicago suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Anthony Lewis, 33, of Chicago was in Cook County Circuit
Court on Wednesday as the indictments were read. He faces 212
counts, including rape, aggravated criminal sexual assault,
kidnapping, and hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted on at least two counts of aggravated criminal
sexual assault, he could be eligible for life in prison, said Mark
Cavins, chief of the sex crimes division at the state attorney's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Cavins said 10 women were attacked between April and July by an
attacker who posed as a census taker, an FBI agent, an immigration
official or a police officer to get into women's homes.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was arrested in the Philippines last month and is being
held without bail. He has denied involvement in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   His attorney, Robert Sharp, could not be reached for comment
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have said DNA analysis linked Lewis to three victims
and his car matches the description of one seen at the scene of an
attack.

<HEADLINE> Chavez: Colombia May Mirror Vietnam  </HEADLINE>
By HAROLD OLMOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Colombia's U.S.-backed efforts to combat
drug traffickers and leftists guerrillas could engulf much of South
America in a Vietnam-like war, Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez was in Brasilia for the first South American summit,
called by Brazil to boost economic and physical integration among
the South American nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be very dangerous if the operation leads to a
military escalation of the conflict,'' Chavez said. ''It could lead
us to a Vietnamization of the whole Amazon region.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time a South American leader had cautioned that
''Plan Colombia,'' a $7.5 billion initiative launched Wednesday by
Colombian President Andres Pastrana and President Clinton, could
degenerate into guerrilla warfare of continental dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela shares a 1,400-mile border with Colombia, while Brazil
shares 960 miles of Amazon frontier with Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some sectors in Colombia and other places may think that the
conflict has a military solution. That is incorrect,'' Chavez said.
''Peace negotiations are the only way to achieve a solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez said Venezuela was ''the most affected country by the
conflicts in Colombia after Colombia itself'' because of the
fleeing refugees who have crossed into Venezuela over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials in Brazil also have expressed concern that
the initiative could force drug traffickers and guerrillas to cross
into Brazil, which has placed army and police troops in the region
on alert.
</P>
<P>
   In Colombia, President Clinton pledged solidarity and $1.3
billion to that country's anti-drug campaign while dismissing fears
that conflict could lead to a new Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ''A condition of this aid is that we are not going to get into a
shooting war,'' Clinton said. ''This is not Vietnam, neither is it
Yankee imperialism.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez said he would propose to his South American colleagues
the creation of a South Atlantic Treaty Organization, which would
have similar objectives as NATO.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Venezuela would propose to the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries an automatic oil price band that
would increase or decrease oil production by 500,000 million
barrels per day whenever oil prices rise over $28 per barrel or
fall below $22 during a period of 20 consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil closed Wednesday at a two-month high of $33 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez did not specify when the proposal would go into effect or
if it was still to be discussed by OPEC.

<HEADLINE> Town evacuated after rail car leaks ammonia  </HEADLINE>
AP Photos XGLF101-102
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT EDWARD, N.Y. (AP) - About 800 residents headed into their
second night away from home Wednesday, evacuated nearly 24 hours
earlier when a rail car began leaking ammonia.
</P>
<P>
   Safety officials and repair crews were still on the scene late
Wednesday, figuring out how to stop the escaping anhydrous ammonia
that was headed to a local paper plant when the leak happened.
</P>
<P>
   The spill is being blamed on a gasket on top of the tanker car.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials said 61 people were treated at a local hospital,
some of them children who suffered asthma symptoms as a reaction to
ammonia vapors and stress. None of the injuries was believed to be
serious and no one was admitted to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said a 30,000 gallon tank from Canadian Terra
International began leaking ammonia vapor at 11 p.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning at about 1 a.m., police, fire and rescue officials
went door to door to evacuate all downtown homes in the Washington
County village, including those downwind from the leaky Canadian
Pacific rail car.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 of the evacuated residents gathered a local school,
and others went to the homes of friends or relatives. Since then,
an emergency shelter has been opened at the roomier Hudson Falls
High School.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen ambulances and rescuers from Washington, Warren and
Saratoga counties were sent to the scene. Emergency response teams
were trying to put a temporary cap on the valve, said Max Fruchter,
spokesman for the Fort Edward Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   Roads around the village were closed for the duration.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no train accident, just a valve malfunction,''
Fruchter said, adding that if the cap effort was unsuccessful,
people would be unable to return home for 24 to 36 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Edward is 43 miles northeast of Albany.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scholar's Copyright Upheld  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld an
Israeli scholar's copyright on the deciphering of one of the Dead
Sea Scrolls, the musty documents chronicling Holy Land life in the
time of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   The decision -- the latest in the years-long battle between
overseas academics and scholars here over who controls the scraps
of parchment -- levels fines against a trio of U.S.-based scholars
for copyright violation.
</P>
<P>
   Amos Hausner, a lawyer for U.S. scholar Robert Eisenman, said
the decision inhibits the free use of scientific knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like copyrighting scientific truth, like Einstein
copyrighting 'e equals mc2,''' Hausner said. ''These ancient texts
are part of the scientific knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue was research by Elisha Qimron, a scholar at Ben Gurion
University in the Israeli desert town of Beersheva.
</P>
<P>
   After years of painstaking study of hundreds of fragments sifted
from 15,000 found in cave near the Dead Sea, Qimron pieced together
a 2,000-year-old missive from the leader of a Jewish sect based in
the Judean Desert to a Jewish leader in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1992, three scholars included Qimron's paper in a book
they published and edited, ''A Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea
Scrolls.'' They did not have Qimron's permission. The publisher,
Hershel Shanks, obtained a draft of the paper circulating among
scholars for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Yaakov Tirkel, writing for a unanimous three-judge panel,
agreed that Qimron could not claim copyright on the scroll
fragments, nor on those fragments that were pieced together by
physical resemblance.
</P>
<P>
   However, the deduction of the 40 percent of the text that was
missing emerged from Qimron's ''creative depths,'' Tirkel said, and
the scholar was therefore was entitled to the copyright.
</P>
<P>
   The court acknowledged the lesser role of Eisenman and James
Robinson in the copyright violation, fining them $2,500 as opposed
to the $10,000 it fined Shanks. Tirkel said the two were still
liable because they did not demand that Shanks remove their names
as editors once they discovered he was to include Qimron's work.
</P>
<P>
   Shanks, editor of the Washington-based Biblical Archaeology
Review, said he ''respectfully'' disagreed with the decision but
would abide by it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think our publication was in the context of a campaign to
free the scrolls,'' he said. ''The implication is now that a
scholar can use it (the scrolls) for his scholarly work, and to
that extent the Supreme Court decision is an improvement over the
lower court,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The scrolls, mostly in fragments by the time of their discovery
in caves near the Dead Sea in the late 1940s and early 1950s, are
believed to be from the archives of Jewish sects who lived in the
area around the time of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Israel gained control of them during the Six-Day War in 1967 and
gave exclusive access to a small committee that locked out other
scholars.
</P>
<P>
   The scrolls found whole were published, but 20 percent of the
documents, mostly thousands of confusing bits, remained unavailable
until Shanks began publishing copies in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ''A Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls,'' was
another part of Shanks' campaign to open the scrolls to others.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints from academics and the campaign for more access
forced changes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case allowed the (Israeli) establishment to maintain a
monopoly on the scrolls,'' said Eisenman, a professor of Middle
East Religions and Archaeology at California State University-Long
Beach. ''It's had a chilling effect on my work.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the ''monopoly'' is over. The scrolls -- and the
scholarship by Qimron and others -- are now available for study on
CD-ROM and in book form.
</P>
<P>
   That, Qimron acknowledged, was a result of the publication of
the book by Shanks, Robinson and Eisenman.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all open now,'' he said. ''The (Israel) Antiquities
Authority decided to open it up after they published.''
</P>
<P>
   Although overjoyed that the case was over -- Eisenman's lawyer
said an appeal was unlikely -- Qimron said he has regrets about the
access others now have to the scrolls. He said it robbed scholars
such as himself of the leisurely pace they once enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now there are a lot of people, and they work in haste to beat
each other to publication,'' he said. ''That's not proper.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisenman said he expected the decision: ''It's a hometown
court,'' he said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Shanks acknowledged that the decision to include
Qimron's work was his own -- and was made despite his and Robinson's
objections -- yet the court still fined them in its decision.
</P>
<P>
   That was proof, Eisenman said, that Israel has assumed a
''monopoly'' over the scrolls and that authorities here are not
ready to countenance study of the texts by others.
</P>
<P>
   ''After the way we were treated, young scholars now will not
stand against the establishment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Osnat Gouez, a spokeswoman for the Antiquities Authority,
dismissed the claim as ''outrageous'' and not worthy of further
comment.

<HEADLINE> Protests, Support for Clinton Visit  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- President Clinton's visit to Colombia
Wednesday was greeted by a bomb scare, scattered rebel attacks and
some violent street protests demanding the ''gringos'' go home.
</P>
<P>
   But his presence and growing U.S. military aid to the war-torn
country appear to enjoy broad support here, despite the traditional
sensitivity about U.S. involvement in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Policies such as the long-standing U.S. trade embargo against
Cuba, the 1989 U.S. invasion of Panama and Washington's support for
Nicaraguan rebels and the Salvadoran military during the 1980s have
bred resentment in the region.
</P>
<P>
   But in a Gallup poll published over the weekend, 56 percent of
Colombians said they would support direct U.S. military
intervention to resolve their country's 36-year guerrilla conflict.
Forty percent said they were opposed to such an action, in the
telephone survey with a 5 percent margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   Another poll published Tuesday in El Espectador newspaper found
74 percent of Colombians approve of Clinton's visit, and just 20
percent oppose it. The poll had a 2.4 percent error margin.
</P>
<P>
   ''Colombia can't wipe out its drug trafficking problem by
itself. We need help, and I personally welcome the aid from the
United States,'' said Mauricio Lopez, a businessman, as he ate at a
McDonald's in an upscale Bogota neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   People waved Colombian and U.S. flags and cheered Clinton's
motorcade Wednesday as it wound through the cobblestone streets of
the Caribbean port of Cartagena, the site of the one-day stop.
</P>
<P>
   But Colombians opposed to a $1.3 billion aid package for the
South American country -- largely for helicopters and troop training
-- were also out in force.
</P>
<P>
   In Bogota, at least 2,000 labor unionists and students marched
from the National University to the U.S. embassy, chanting
anti-Clinton slogans and burning American flags and effigies of
Pastrana and Clinton. Ski-masked students torched a bus, and a riot
police officer died after being struck in the head by a homemade
grenade thrown from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-drug aid package ''violates our national sovereignty,''
said Pablo, a 20-year-old student leader. The real goal of U.S.
policy is to squash the rebels and enforce economic policies that
favor multinational business at the expense of the poor, Pablo
claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters also burned American flags in Medellin and Cali,
Colombia's second-and-third largest cities. In Cartagena, police
scuffled with protesters outside the convention center serving the
foreign press and arrested four of them. One demonstrator had been
shouted into a megaphone: ''Go home Clinton, violator of human
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas also made their feelings known with scattered
attacks apparently timed to mar Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Police blamed the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or
FARC, for a small bomb discovered in a Cartagena neighborhood hours
before Clinton was scheduled to appear there Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Perdomo, spokesman for the National Police, said the bomb
was apparently intended to spread propaganda leaflets, not cause
injuries. Two FARC members seen planting the device were arrested,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, two guerrillas died in clashes with the army
outside Cali and two others died when a bomb they tried to lay on a
highway in eastern Arauca state accidentally exploded.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, FARC set off small bombs, skirmished with troops and
shot at rural police stations in seven of the country's 32 states --
killing two officers and at least seven civilians.
</P>
<P>
   While opposing growing military ties between the United States
and Colombia, even the rebels insist they have nothing against the
American people.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we oppose are the imperial policies of the United States
government,'' a bearded FARC rebel leader, Alfonso Cano, told The
Associated Press in southern Colombia last week.

<HEADLINE> Small Plane Crashes, Kills 2 in Va.  </HEADLINE>
By KIA SHANT'E BREAUX
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Va. (AP) -- A small plane crashed in front of a
fraternity at Washington and Lee University on Wednesday, killing
both passengers, one of whom either fell from the plane or tried to
jump, police said.
</P>
<P>
   One person on the ground was hit in the head by a piece of
debris but wasn't seriously injured, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that it only damaged a sidewalk and maybe a brick
wall is remarkable,'' said Lt. Steve Crowder of the Lexington
Police Department. Few students were on campus since most fall
classes won't begin for another week.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses told police they heard a noise like an explosion and
saw someone hanging onto the side of the two-seat plane as it
spiraled toward the ground about 5:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Trooper Mike Hamilton said one of the victims either jumped or
fell out and one body was found outside the wreckage. Neither
victim's identity was immediately released.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton said the plane was heading for Daytona Beach, Fla., and
had made a stop at Martinsburg, W.Va. At some point, the pilot
changed the flight plan to land at Columbia, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Gordon, a house mother at a fraternity house, was in the
parking lot when she saw the plane diving toward her.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could see it coming down and I thought, 'That crazy fool,
what is he doing?''' Gordon said. Then she noticed a wing of the
plane was missing and saw the aircraft explode in midair.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hit the pavement,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration and the National
Transportation Safety Board are investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Another small plane crashed Wednesday in the Mississippi River
near Grafton, Ill., killing two people on board. Witnesses told
authorities the plane was flying low just before it nose-dived into
the river. The plane had left St. Charles County airport, northwest
of St. Louis.

<HEADLINE> Thai Doctors Accused of Murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thai police Wednesday accused two
doctors and a former hospital executive of killing two patients in
order to harvest their kidneys for sale to other patients who
wanted transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Police charged the three with conspiring to commit murder and
accused them of transplanting kidneys illegally from dead patients,
according to a report submitted to the state prosecutor's office.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear how the patients died.
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney will decide soon whether to prosecute them,
said Anuchart Kongmalai, a state attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Sirot Karnjanaprasertpol, the former director of Vachiraprakarn
Hospital, another doctor and the hospital manager were charged with
conspiracy to commit murder and falsifying documents certifying the
deaths of the two patients. They have already denied the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   They deny the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Police dropped the charges against a fourth suspect whom they
plan to use as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged offenses came to light last year, after a relative
of one of the victims took his story to the media.
</P>
<P>
   Previously published information on the case indicated that the
hospital officials were not accused of actively causing the
victims' deaths, but rather cutting corners in declaring a patient
legally dead.
</P>
<P>
   The case started in February, when Thailand's Medical Council --
a medical ethics board -- revoked or suspended the medical licenses
of several doctors at the hospital after finding they had illegally
traded in human organs.
</P>
<P>
   The council said it had sufficient evidence to show doctors had
procured kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   Trading in organs is prohibited in Thailand. Organ donation is
supposed to be done by agreement between donors and recipients with
no money changing hands.

<HEADLINE> Water Main Floods Cleveland Streets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- A private subcontractor installing a fiber
optic line hit a water main line Wednesday, causing the downtown
area to flood for the second time this year.
</P>
<P>
   City officials ordered the temporary closure of several streets
and issued a water boil order until 6 p.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of damage was not known, said Michael Konicek,
director of the city's Department of Public Utilities. He said
crews were digging a hole Wednesday night to reach the area where a
private subcontractor's backhoe hit the water main line, creating a
5-foot-long hole.
</P>
<P>
   Konicek said his department was investigating whether the
30-inch water main line, which was at least 80 years old, was
marked.
</P>
<P>
   The break sent water into the basements of four buildings.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 12, a 36-inch water main break sent 25 million gallons
of water through downtown streets. Much of the water froze before
city workers got the situation under control.

Clinton Brings Aid To Colombia
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) -- In a country beset by decades of violence,
President Clinton delivered a $1.3 billion U.S. package Wednesday which he said
would help Colombia defeat its drug traffickers without getting the United
States into a Vietnam-like quagmire. ''We will not get into a shooting war''
with Colombian guerrillas, he said, standing alongside Colombian President
Andres Pastrana. During Clinton's half-day visit to Cartagena, police said they
discovered and deactivated a 4.4-pound bomb found five blocks from a
neighborhood Clinton planned to tour.

Cheney Laments State of Military
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Dick Cheney said Wednesday a military made strong in the
1980s by GOP-led defense spending is now low on morale, weapons and soldiers
because of ''eight years of neglect and misplaced priorities'' by the
Clinton-Gore administration. Cheney, the former defense secretary and now GOP
vice presidential candidate, said troops have been hurt by spending cuts. Vice
President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential candidate, responded to Cheney's
speech by pointing out recent budget boosts. ''We have the strongest military in
the world and we reversed the decline of the Bush-Quayle years,'' Gore told
reporters.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal cost of fighting wildfires across the West
soon will exceed $1 billion with Congress likely to dip into the treasury again
this year to pay the final tab, federal officials said Wednesday. So far, the
federal government has tallied at least $626 million in costs to battle scores
of fires from Montana to New Mexico, spending as much as $18 million a day,
according to the National Interagency Fire Center, which is coordinating the
firefighting effort.

   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thai police Thursday accused two doctors and a
former hospital executive of killing two patients in order to harvest their
kidneys for sale to other patients who wanted transplants. Police charged the

will decide soon whether to prosecute them, said Anuchart Kongmalai, a state
attorney.

N.J. Construction Site Fire Spreads
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   EDGEWATER, N.J. (AP) -- Fire engulfed a five-story condominium complex under
construction along the Hudson River on Wednesday. The roaring fire, which could
be seen miles away and across the river in New York City, forced the evacuation
of homes in nearby Cliffside Park, police said. No one was living yet in the
Avalon River Mews condominiums being built on the former site of an Alcoa plant.
Police said no injuries were reported. Water from fire trucks was sprayed on
houses and trees across the street from the site in an effort to keep the blaze
from spreading.

Judge May Order Ford Recall
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A judge said he may order a recall of as many as 2
million Ford Motor Co. vehicles over concerns that they are prone to stalling,
and accused the company of deceiving federal safety investigators and consumers.
Ford denied the allegations. It's a new blow for the Dearborn, Mich.-based
automaker, which is involved in this month's recall of 6.5 million Firestone
tires, which were standard equipment on some Ford trucks and sports utility
vehicles. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating 62
deaths that may be linked to the tires.
