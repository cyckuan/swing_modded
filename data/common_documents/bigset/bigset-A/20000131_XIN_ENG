<HEADLINE> Sonia Gandhi Arrested During March to PM's House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 30 (Xinhua) -- India's National Congress
Party President Sonia Gandhi and 17 other senior party leaders
were arrested here on Sunday for "violating prohibitory orders"
while leading a protest march toward the prime minister's
residence.
</P>
<P>
Gandhi, along with the 17, was arrested under the Delhi Police
Act near Tees January Marg in Downtown Delhi, said R K Niyogi,
joint commissioner of the Delhi police.
</P>
<P>
Congress spokesman Ajit Jogi confirmed the arrest, saying
Gandhi and several other party members "courted arrest as they
were prevented from proceeding to the prime minister's residence."
</P>
<P>
"Subsequently, all of them were released," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
According to local police sources, Gandhi was "detained for a
minute" before getting freed and left immediately after the
release.
</P>
<P>
The march, which occurred at around 9:30 a.m. and was
participated by about 1,000 Congress workers, was organized to
protest the Gujarat state government's decision to lift a ban on
its employees from participating in activities of the RSS (
National Service Union), an organization close to the ruling BJP
party.

<P>
Witnesses said Gandhi was at the head of the procession when
she was stopped by the police at a road crossing close to the
prime minister's residence and then taken into custody.

<HEADLINE> Human Rights Group Urges Israel to Restrain in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 31 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli human rights group
on Monday called on Israeli government to act with restraint in
south Lebanon following losses it suffered there.
</P>
<P>
"Violent retaliation will only lead to a violent response by the
other side," said the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights
in the Occupied Territories (B'TSELEM) in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The vicious cycle of bloodshed and death will never end and
violations of the human rights of innocent residents on both sides
of the border will continue," it added.
</P>
<P>
Deputy commander of Israel's proxy militia, colonel Akel Hashem,
was killed on Sunday in a bomb attack near his home in the western
sector of Israeli-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon. The
Shiite Muslim militant group Hezbollah, or Party of God, has
claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
Three Israeli soldiers were blown up in a Hezbollah attack on
Monday, bringing total Israel losses to four so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who vowed in Cairo on Sunday
that Israel would punish these responsible for the killing, called
a special cabinet meeting on Monday to discuss the situation in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said after the meeting that there will be no peace talks with
Syria until it reins in Hezbollah, believed to be supported by
Syria and Iran.
</P>
<P>
At Monday's cabinet session, several ministers urged Barak to
take some action, while others called on Barak to order an
immediate withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In the Knesset (parliament), members from both the ruling and
opposition parties also divided on whether to retaliate.
</P>
<P>
Israel Air Force on Monday continued air strikes against
selected Hezbollah positions both inside and outside the security
zone, while SLA and IDF pounded Hezbollah targets.
</P>
<P>
The escalation of Hezbollah attack dealt the heaviest blow to
the SLA and IDF since Israel set up the security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985.
</P>
<P>
B'TSELEM said in its statement that based on previous
experiences and the nature of warfare in south Lebanon, retaliatory
attacks as air strike and shelling fail to distinguish between
military and civilian targets and often result in civilian
casualties.
</P>
<P>
The principle that every individual is responsible for his or
her own acts and should not be punished for the acts of others is a
fundamental principle of Israeli and international law, it added.

<HEADLINE> Barak Warns Syria to Rein in Hezbollah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak warned on Monday that if Syria does not prevent Lebanese
Hezbollah from military operations in south Lebanon, there will be
no peace talks between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Barak issued this warning after holding an urgent meeting with
his security cabinet ministers to discuss the new development
inside the Israeli-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel's peace talks with Syria will not resume until Syria
reined in Hezbollah, Barak said in a statement. The peace talks
were suspended indefinitely more than a week ago after two rounds
since December.
</P>
<P>
"Israel will not be able to negotiate peace (with Syria) as long
as the Syrians do not restrain the Hezbollah from acting against
the Israeli army in the security zone," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that Barak issued such a warning to
Syria and Hezbollah that Israel has included easing military
attacks against the Israel Defense Force (IDF) as a condition for
peace talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Israel's red line has traditionally been attacks on Israeli
civilian settlements along Israel's northern border. The tough
warning underscored the pressure Barak faces at home, where he is
under fire in a campaign financing scandal, and the killing of more
IDF soldiers and a senior commander of the proxy South Lebanon Army
(SLA) in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Three Israeli soldiers were blown up Monday and four others
wounded in a Hezbollah attack. Last Tuesday, another IDF soldier,
24-year-old Rafael Zangwill, was killed inside the security zone
when his outpost was hit by a missile.
</P>
<P>
Monday's incident was another serious blow to Israel following
the killing on Sunday of SLA's second-in-command, Akel Hashem.
</P>
<P>
Local media believe that due to the loss of lives of more IDF
soldiers, Israel might not keep quiet but take military actions to
retaliate against Hezbollah, or the Party of God, which Israel
blames for the current escalation in fighting in the security zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the buffer in 1985 with a self-declared purpose of
protecting its northern security.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is a Shiite Muslim militant group fighting against
Israeli occupation since the formation of the security zone.
</P>
<P>
The death toll of the IDF inside the security zone since the
beginning of this year reached four, as compared with 13 for the
whole of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Palestinian Statehood Definite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
said here Monday that the declaration of an independent Palestinian
state with Jerusalem as its capital is definite.
</P>
<P>
The issue is also on the agenda of all meetings of the central,
legislative and national councils of the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA), Arafat told reporters upon his return from Davos
World Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el Sheikh memorandum signed between Israel and
the Palestinians last September, the year 2000 would be the year of
Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
The declaration of Palestinian statehood would top the agenda of
the Palestinian Central Council session slated for February 2, in
Gaza, he added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat noted that his meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton
on the sidelines of the Davos forum was "positive and constructive
as usual."
</P>
<P>
Clinton showed keenness to exert his utmost to push forward the
peace process, he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat pointed out that he agreed with Clinton that a U.S. envoy
would visit the Middle East within the coming days to follow up the
peace process. He hinted that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright could visit the region for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross will arrive in the region on
Wednesday to enhance the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of meeting the February 13 deadline
of the Palestinian-Israeli talks, Arafat said the talks would reach
their set targets, and the Israeli third redeployment in the West
Bank which should have been carried out on January 20 must be
implemented as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak would sincerely
implement the Sharm el Sheikh accord," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian and Israeli negotiators started a 10-day
round of marathon talks near Jerusalem in a bid to meet the
deadline for reaching a framework agreement on the final status.
</P>
<P>
Other two negotiating teams started talks in Jericho on the maps
of the third redeployment of Israeli troops in the West Bank that
had been postponed for 10 days.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Searches for Condoning External Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's Foreign Minister Heinz
Moeller said Monday he will look for a condoning of the country's
external debt for 16 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Moeller said that Ecuador lacks the ability to reimburse the
debt and requires immediate outside credits to be covered by the
nation's petroleum exports.
</P>
<P>
From his position as former president of the Andean Parliament,
he promoted the condoning of his country's external debt.
</P>
<P>
According to the foreign minister, new crediting is justified
owing to having provided Manta air base for antinarcotic fighting
and allotted resources for programs of ecological protection.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador is looking for a renegotiating with creditors of
payments of its debt in Brady bonds, euro bonds and other
obligations.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador is the first country to restructure or default on Brady
bonds, which are themselves the product of a restructuring since
they were created to help Latin American countries overcome their
debt crisis in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The 12.4 million Andean nation is slumped in its worst economic
crisis in decades.

<HEADLINE> UNCTAD, Ethiopia Discuss Investment Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Conference for Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and Ethiopian
investment authorities held a seminar here on Monday focusing on
promotion of investment cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Opening the workshop, Ethiopian Trade and Industry Minister
Kassahun Ayele said that Ethiopia had initiated a profound
economic reform policy which paved a better way for attracting
foreign direct investment.
</P>
<P>
Supportive institutions to create suitable investment
environment in the country have also been established, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Kassahun, the Ethiopian government has approved
more than 5, 000 investment projects with a combined capital of 33
billion birr (about four billion U.S. dollars) so far following
the enactment of the new economic policy.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, despite the favorable investment environment
in Ethiopia, only 205 approved projects, with an aggregate capital
of 10 billion birr (about 1.2 billion U.S. dollars), are foreign
direct investment (FDI) projects.
</P>
<P>
This is because of the negative image attached to Ethiopia as a
result of recurrent drought, famine and civil strife in the
country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tesfachew Teffere, special assistant of UNCTAD Deputy General,
observed that reinforcing domestic investment opportunities and
building links among supportive institutions play a pivotal role
in attracting foreign direct investment.
</P>
<P>
On top of policy formulation and improving infrastructures,
encouraging local investors has a paramount importance to promote
investment in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, which was jointly organized by the UNCTAD, the
Ethiopian Investment Authority and the Ethiopian Science and
Technology Commitment

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President, Govt Condole Air Crash Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President and government
Monday extended their condolences to the families of those killed
in a tragic air crash of the Kenya Airways on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
"The government would do everything possible at the diplomatic
and political level to assist the relations of the victims," the
country's Minister of Aviation Segun Agagu said at Murtala
Muhammed International Airport.
</P>
<P>
He said "the president, the government, and the people of
Nigeria share the moment of anxiety with the families of the
unfortunate crash."
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to the victims' families to keep calm, as
relevant agencies are doing everything possible to acquire
information about the crash.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government had set up a crisis information center
at Murtala Muhammed International Airport, where the unfortunate
airplane was bound for, he said.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that at the time of the crash, all the facilities
and landing aids at Murtala Muhammed airport were fully
functional.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that Kenyan Airways Monday released in Lagos the
names of nine survivors of the crash.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest reports, 10 survivors were found during
the rescue operation off the coast of Abidjan. More than 70
bodies had been collected by the Cote d'Ivoire rescuers.
</P>
<P>
Flight KQ431, bound for Nigeria's economic capital Lagos,
crashed into the sea only one minute after it took off from an
Abidjan airport.
</P>
<P>
The plane, an air bus 310, was carrying 168 passengers and
11crew members when crashed into the cold Atlantic water. There
are more than 20 nationalities on board, but most of them were

<HEADLINE> Khatami Calls for Massive Turnout in Majlis Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 31 (Xinhua) -- President Mohammad Khatami on
Monday called on Iranians to turn out and cast ballots in the
coming parliamentary elections as a way to decide their own
destiny.
</P>
<P>
Khatami made the appeal while visiting the holy shrine of late
supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini with his cabinet on the
eve of the "10-day Dawn" marking the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
"The Iranian people should prove their determination to decide
their own fate and win dignity for their country with a massive
turnout in the elections" slated for February 18, he was quoted by
the Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's call came after a split appeared inside the moderate
camp over former President Hashemi Rafsanjani's candidacy in the
coming elections.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, the incumbent chairman of the powerful arbitral and
advisory State Expediency Council, had served as Majlis
(parliament) speaker for 10 years before being elected president in
1989. His candidacy in the elections is supported by the central-
rightist parties.
</P>
<P>
However, the leftist reformist parties, isolated when Rafsanjani
reigned, considered his nomination a hindrance to Khatami's
reforms, citing his close links with the conservatives,
particularly with supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani is widely believed a Majlis speaker hopeful if he
wins a seat in the parliament, while the leftists lack a candidate
as influential as him.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, nevertheless, called on political groups to treat the
elections with a positive attitude and not let any grudges diminish
election enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
The important thing is the holding of an enthusiastic election
with everybody thereafter feeling that the law was supreme, he
said, adding that the Islamic revolution does not grant special
privileges to any special group or individuals.
</P>
<P>
Election campaigns have already been kicked off by major
political parties. The moderates hope the elections could unseat
the conservative grip of the Majlis, while the conservatives try
hard to hang on power.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the crack inside the moderate coalition
which pins hope on winning a majority in the Majlis might cause a
backlash.
</P>
<P>
Some local newspapers said that the conservatives who suffered
major setbacks in elections during the past two years have changed
their tunes and tactics in an effort to maintain their domination
in the political arena.

<HEADLINE> Three Israeli Soldiers Killed In South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Three Israeli soldiers were
killed on Monday inside the security zone in south Lebanon and four
others wounded, Israeli military confirmed Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Among the wounded, one is in serious condition and has been
helicoptered to a Haifa hospital for treatment, the military
announced.
</P>
<P>
Their outpost inside the Israeli-imposed security zone was hit
by rockets earlier Monday and three soldiers of the Israel Defense
Force (IDF) were blown up on the spot, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
The killings were one of the heaviest casualties during Israel's
nearly 22 years' presence in south Lebanon, and brought Israeli
losses so far this year to four. Last Tuesday, another IDF soldier,
24-year-old Rafael Zangwill, was killed inside the security zone
when his outpost was hit by missile.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli military did not give details of the attack, but
said the IDF returned fire against the assailants. According to IDF
regulations, the names of the killed could be only be announced
after their families are informed.
</P>
<P>
Monday's incident was another serious blow to Israel following
the killing on Sunday of deputy commander of the South Lebanon Army
(SLA), Akel Hashem.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak summoned his security cabinet
ministers for an urgent meeting to discuss the situation inside the
security zone.
</P>
<P>
Local media believes that due to the loss of lives of more IDF
soldiers, Israel might not keep quiet but take military actions to
retaliate against Hezbollah, or Party of God, which Israel blames
for the current escalation of fighting in the security zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up this buffer zone in 1985 after two invasion, with
a self-proclaimed purpose of protecting its northern security.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is a Shiite Muslim military organization fighting
against the Israeli occupation since the formation of the security
zone. It is believed to be backed by Syria and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 13 Israeli soldiers lost their lives in south Lebanon
where Israeli troops have been bogged down in a war of attrition
with resistance movements.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Continue Final-Status Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Israel and Palestinian
negotiators met secretly again on Monday near Jerusalem to discuss
a draft peace deal between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
This was the second meeting of the current intensive peace talks
between the two sides, which started at a secret location north of
Jerusalem on Sunday and will last for about 10 days.
</P>
<P>
To ensure this intensive talks going on smoothly, the two sides
agreed to impose a press blackout through the whole talks.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's deputy Mahmoud Abbas on
Monday gave a light picture of the current talks, saying that the
two sides would try to bridge gaps to reach a framework for a final
peace agreement which Palestinians hope will end in an independent
state.
</P>
<P>
Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, expressed his welcome to the
arrival of the U.S. special peace envoy Dennis Ross to the region,
saying the U.S envoy could help bridge any gaps between Israelis
and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Ross is scheduled to arrive here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"During the coming 10 days of intensive talks, the two sides
will explore the possibility of drafting a framework agreement,"
Abbas said, adding that "the American involvement would not be as a
direct participant in the talks, but would be around to try to help
when needed."
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el Sheikh peace deal signed in Egypt last
September, the two sides have to reach a framework on final-status
talks by February 13 and a final peace agreement by September this
years.
</P>
<P>
The fate of Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, borders, Jewish
settlements and water are the main thorniest issues waiting for the
two sides to settle during the current final-status talks.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Seeks Closer Military Cooperation With Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdel
Rauf Rawabdeh on Monday called for closer military cooperation
between Jordan and Saudi Arabia for an overall revival of bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh, who is also holding the defense portfolio, made the
remarks in a meeting with visiting Saudi Arabian Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff Saleh Bin Ali Muhayya, the highest-ranking
Saudi military official to visit Jordan in a decade.
</P>
<P>
The visit here by the Saudi Arabian general marked a step
forward in the warming up of relations between the two countries,
which had been severely damaged by the 1990 Gulf Crisis.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that both the Jordanian and Saudi
Arabian governments are keen to develop bilateral ties in all
fields following visions and directives from Jordanian King
Abdullah Bin Hussein and Saudi Arabian King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
For his part, General Muhayya said his country were ready to
cooperate with Jordan and other Arab countries in the military
field, including the exchange of military expertise.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the role and performance by the Jordanian armed
forces in regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
Jordan had been isolated by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other Arab
countries for its sympathy with Baghdad who triggered the Gulf
crisis by invading Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 Jordanian workers, most of whom are doctors,
lawyers, engineers and other well-paid professionals, were expelled
by Kuwait and some other Gulf states during the crisis, incurring
an annual remittances loss on Jordan of some 2 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, once the largest donor country to Jordan, also
suspended its financial aid and oil supplies to Jordan after the
crisis broke out.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's ties with Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have thawed since
Abdullah acceded to the throne last February after his father King
Hussein Ibn Talal died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
However, it will take time to restore the ties to the original
level prior to the Gulf Crisis as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have not
opened their markets to the Jordanian labor force.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Jordan has to strike a delicate diplomatic balance
between Iraq and Iraq's Arab foes, such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia,
because Iraq is the only supplier of crude oil and oil products to
Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Mobile Service Hooked up to Israeli Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian cellular phone company
Jawal on Monday was hooked up to Israel's telephone network, thus
enabling the company to expand its service to Israel and the
Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
The linkage was carried out under an agreement signed with the
Israeli Orange company for telecommunications in last November.
</P>
<P>
The two companies, which apply the same digital technology GMS
in providing wireless service, had agreed to expand their service
coverage by sharing each other's signal transmission network.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Orange had also agreed to provide mobile phone
service to Jawal's subscribers inside Israel as from January 31.
</P>
<P>
Jawal's service used to be confined to Gaza and the West Bank
areas, especially close to Ramallah. And its subscribers in Israel
can only enjoy one-way service, which means they can make phone
calls to Israel but no way to receive calls from the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
So far, Jawal has extended its service to 11 countries including
Egypt, Jordan, Switzerland, Britain, Turkey, Greece, Australia,
Norway, France, China and Israel. And the number of its subscribers
has reached 7,000, according to September figures.
</P>
<P>
Jawal opened its first office in Gaza last June and the second
one in the West Bank last September.
</P>
<P>
Jawal has signed similar deals with 80 mobile phone service
providers in 70 countries to operate mobile service worldwide.

<HEADLINE> British Judge Backs Pinochet Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- A British judge on Monday backed
the government's decision to send former Chilean leader Augusto
Pinochet home because he is medically unfit to stand trial on
torture charges in Spain.
</P>
<P>
High Court judge Maurice Kay rejected an application from
Belgium and other human rights groups for judicial review of Home
Secretary Jack Straw's decision to send Pinochet back to Chile.
</P>
<P>
Straw said on January 11 that he was "minded' to release
Pinochet from 15 months of house arrest after four independent
British doctors found he was medically unfit to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
"In my judgment, neither Amnesty International and the other
human rights groups nor Belgium have arguable grounds for judicial
review and accordingly I shall refuse both applications," Kay told
the High Court.
</P>
<P>
He said that Straw had acted "lawfully, fairly and rationally"
and backed his decision not to disclose the results of a medical
examination carried out on the 84-year-old Pinochet by British
doctors earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Kay's ruling was set for further legal wrangling. Human rights
activists and lawyers had expressed anger and dismay at the ruling,
while Belgium said clearly that it would appeal against the ruling.
</P>
<P>
Amnesty said it was considering its legal options and would
decide later on Monday whether to take the case to the three-judge
Court of Appeal, Britain's highest court.
</P>
<P>
The decision to appeal by Belgium, which was acting in the case
on behalf of Chilean exiles, could mean Pinochet must endure at
least another week's exile in Britain.
</P>
<P>
A Pinochet lawyer predicted that the case could drag on for
three weeks or more.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Chilean air force plane is waiting at an airbase
northwest of London to whisk the general home if he is allowed to
go free.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested in London in October 1998 while he was
recovering from a minor back operation in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
A Spanish judge launched extradition proceedings to try him on
torture charges. It was alleged that more than 3,000 people died
or disappeared during Pinochet's iron-fisted rule of Chile from
1973 to 1990.

<HEADLINE> British Government Rocked by Minister's Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Britain's popular Junior Defense
Minister Peter Kilfoyle shook the government on Sunday night by
announcing his return to the backbenches with a hint that his
resignation is a mark of disillusion with Prime Minister Tony
Blair's New Labor.
</P>
<P>
Blair moved swiftly on Monday to replace Kilfoyle with Scottish
MP Lewis Moonie.
</P>
<P>
But Blair's official spokesman could or would not clear up why
a minister, part of a government way ahead in the polls, would
quit in mid-term when there was no hint of ill-health.
</P>
<P>
"Having reflected long and hard on how I can best use my
political energies in the interests of my constituents and the
Labor Party, I have concluded that I should return to the
backbenches," Kilfoyle said in his letter.
</P>
<P>
Kilfoyle, who hails from the northern city of Liverpool, one of
Britain's most deprived areas, later told a local newspaper he
would be a "critical friend" of the government.
</P>
<P>
"My decision has not been forced, but as a minister I do not
have the freedom to speak out about the issues I feel are most
important," he told the Liverpool Echo.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman would not comment on his motives but said the
government had done plenty for the poorer sections of society.
</P>
<P>
Last week, an opinion poll showed more than half of Britons
were dissatisfied with Blair's government for the first time since
it came to power in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Who Knows When UK Will Be In Euro-Zone: ECB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Prospects for Britain's entry
into the euro-zone have been set back further as Wim Duisenberg,
president of the European Central Bank, said it would take Britain
several years to be ready for membership.
</P>
<P>
In a BBC television interview Sunday, Duisenberg said he
thought it would be in Britain's interests to join the euro area.
"But it is up to the people of Britain to come to the same
conclusion," he said.
</P>
<P>
His comments came as an opinion poll released Monday shows
opposition to the single currency to be at a record high.
</P>
<P>
According to an ICM poll carried out for BBC Radio 4's Today
program, 69 percent of voters are opposed to the pound being
replaced by the euro and only 22 percent are in favor.
</P>
<P>
Duisenberg's comments and the BBC poll will strengthen the hand
of those Labor strategists who want to play down the prospects of
an early referendum so that it does not become a dominant issue at
the next election.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Council Extends Mandate of UNIFIL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Monday decided to extend the mandate of the
United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon for a further period of
six months until July 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution unanimously adopted, the Security Council
reiterated its strong support for the territorial integrity,
sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon within its
internationally recognized boundaries.
</P>
<P>
The Council called on the parties concerned to cooperate fully
with the Force for the full implementation of its mandate.
</P>
<P>
The Council condemned all acts of violence committed in
particular against the Force and urged the parties to put an end
to them.
</P>
<P>
It reiterated that the Force should fully implement its mandate
as defined in relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
In a related presidential statement, the Council expressed its
concern over the continuing violence in Southern Lebanon,
regretted the loss of civilian life, and urged all parties to
exercise restraint.
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL was established in 1978 to confirm the withdrawal of
Israeli forces from southern Lebanon, to restore international
peace and security, and to assist the Government of Lebanon in
ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area.
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL has, however, been prevented from fully implementing its
mandate. Israel has maintained its occupation of parts of south
Lebanon, where the Israeli forces and their local auxiliary
continued to be targets of attacks by groups that have proclaimed
their resistance to the occupation.

<HEADLINE> Russia Rejects U.S. Slam on Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Monday rejected
visiting U.S. State Secretary Madeleine Albright's statement on
Russia's possible isolation because of its underway anti-terrorist
military operation in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
There are clear differences in the positions of Moscow and
Washington on Chechnya, and Russia's continuing action in Chechnya
could lead to the country's further isolation in the world,
Albright told a joint news conference after her meeting with
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov in Moscow on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to Albright, at the meeting she warned Ivanov that
Russia could have to pay for its actions in Chechnya in the
international arena.
</P>
<P>
Washington believes that there is no military solution to the
problem of Chechnya and that political dialogue should begin, she
said.
</P>
<P>
However, Ivanov said at the same press conference that he
thinks Russia will not in fact be isolated.
</P>
<P>
"It is hardly justifiable to speak about Russia's being
isolated, and if there is any such isolation it is of a temporary
nature," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, Russian presidential aide in
charge of media coverage of Russia's anti-terrorist campaign in
Chechnya, also categorically refuted Albright's statement that
Chechnya could cause Russia's isolation in international community.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to imagine how Russia could be isolated, "
Yastrzhembsky said at a Monday news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Albright's statement "was aimed more at U.S. public opinion
rather than corresponding with the real possibilities and
intentions of our partners," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This problem has already grown beyond being only Russia's," he
said, adding that a base for international terrorists has been set
up in Chechnya where terrorist acts were prepared, including
attacks on the Georgian and Uzbek presidents.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky then expressed his confidence that Albright "will
receive additional information that will help her assess the
situation in a more complete manner" during her visit in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived in Moscow for an official visit Sunday night
and will remain in the Russian capital until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
She held talks with Ivanov Monday and Russian acting President
Vladimir Putin is expected to receive her.
</P>
<P>
She will also attend a ministerial meeting of the group for
multilateral talks on the Middle East. Russia and the U.S. are co-
sponsors of the Mideast peace process.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Personal Spending Rises Much Higher Than Income in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. personal income rose in
December while they spent all of it and more, giving the nation's
retailers their best holiday sales in years.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported Monday that personal income,
which includes wages, interest and government benefits, increased
by 0.3 percent last month, following a 0.4 percent rise in
November. But December's gain was the smallest increase since
September and was weaker than the surge analysts were anticipating.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, spending picked up a brisk 0.8 percent,
following a 0.7 percent gain in November, the report said. Last
month's increase in spending was the biggest rise since August of
1999.
</P>
<P>
With people spending more than they earned in December, the
personal savings rate, savings as a percentage of after-tax income,
was pulled to a record monthly low of 1.5 percent. In November,
the savings rate was 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
All that spending also pushed the savings rate to an all-time
annual low of 2.4 percent in 1999, compared with a 3.7 percent
rate the year before.
</P>
<P>
However, the record low savings numbers posted for December and
for the year do not reflect gains households have realized on
their savings from such things as rising stock market values and
higher real estate values for their homes.
</P>
<P>
Even with those rate increases, many economists believe the
economy continues to power ahead at a rapid pace that probably can
't be sustained without triggering inflation. But they expected
the Federal Reserve would boost interest rates by a quarter of a
percentage point at the end of a two-day meeting Wednesday to slow
the red-hot economy.
</P>
<P>
For all of 1999, the nation's personal income rose 5.9 percent,
matching the increase posted in 1998, and led by a 6.8 percent
boost in wages.In 1998, wages rose 7.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Spending in the year increased 7 percent, following a 6 percent
gain the year before, marking the biggest jump in spending since a
7.4 percent rise in 1989.
</P>
<P>
In December, wages rose by 0.7 percent, following a 0.3 percent
rise the month before, while spending in the month was led by a
big 1.3 percent increase in purchases of nondurable goods, such as
food and fuel.
</P>
<P>
For durable goods, such as washing machines and cars, spending
rose 0.8 percent in December, following a 2.2 percent increase the
month before.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Council Extends Mandate of UNOMIG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Monday decided to extend the mandate of the
United Nations Observer Mission in George for a further period of
six months until July 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
In its resolution unanimously adopted, the Security Council
reiterated its call for the parties to the conflict to deepen
their commitment to the United Nations-led peace process, continue
to expand their dialogue, and display without delay the necessary
will to achieve substantial results on the key issues of the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also reiterated that it considered
unacceptable and illegitimate the holding of self-styled
elections and referendum in Abkhazia, Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The Council called on the parties to continue to enhance their
efforts to implement fully the confidence-building measures on
which they agreed at the Athens and Istanbul meetings and observe
strictly the Moscow Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Council reaffirmed the necessity for the parties strictly
to respect human rights and supported the efforts of the U.N.
Secretary-General to find ways to improve their observance as an
integral part of the work towards a comprehensive political
settlement.
</P>
<P>
UNOMIG was originally established in 1993 by the Security
Council to verify compliance with the 27 July 1993 ceasefire
agreement between the Government of Georgia and the Abkhaz
authorities in Georgia, to investigate reports of ceasefire
violations and to attempt to resolve such incidents with the
parties involved.
</P>
<P>
After UNOMIG's original mandate had been invalidated by the
resumed fighting in Abhazia in September 1993, the Mission was
given an interim mandate by the Security Council to maintain
contacts with both sides to the conflict and with Russian military
contingents, and to monitor and report on the situation, with
particular reference to developments relevant to United Nations
efforts to promote a comprehensive political settlement.

<HEADLINE> Greece Hopes for Progress in New Round of Cyprus Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Greece Monday expressed hope
that progress can be made in the new round of U.N.-sponsored
proximity talks in Geneva between the two communities on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
To find a solution to the 26-year division problem in the
island, the Greek and Turkish Cypriots communities held their
first round of talks in New York last month and the second round
of talks began Monday in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
To comment on the proximity talks in Geneva, Greek government
spokesman Dimitris Reppas said that Greece's stance was that talks
on a resolution of the Cyprus problem must be substantive, to
proceed in depth and to embrace all the aspects of the issue.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that for progress to be marked in this sector, the
other side must show in practice a flexibility, good willingness
and intent to seek and find a solution.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Greece and the Cyprus Republic-led by President Glafcos
Clerides maintain that a federal solution to the Cyprus problem is
the only basis for discussion, in line with U.N. resolutions and
international law, but the northern Cyprus, illegally formed in
1983 and recognized only by Turkey, demands that a confederation
formed by two sovereign states be set up in the Mediterranean
island as a way out of the Cyprus crisis.
</P>
<P>
Turkey also reiterated Monday its standing position over a
confederation solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
In an announcement issue Monday, the Turkish Foreign Ministry
reportedly said that the proposal by Denktash of a confederation
of two states was the most realistic model for a solution to the
Cyprus issue.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Security Council to Take More Efforts on Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- China Monday called on
the U.N. Security Council to work harder for Africa in order to
avoid what has been described "more talk than deed" in the 15-
nation body.
</P>
<P>
The appeal came as Qin Huasun, the Chinese permanent
representative to the United Nations, took the floor at an open
Security Council session on Africa.
</P>
<P>
"It has always been a major task for the Security Council to
resolve the conflicts in Africa in a timely and effective manner,"
Qin said.
</P>
<P>
"We are heartened to see that the situation at the Central
African Republic, Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone and many other
places is moving towards reality," he said. "At the same time, we
have noted with concern that the proposed referendum in Western
Sahara is still elusive, chaos and fighting still rage on in
Somalia and the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (
DRC) has not been resolved."
</P>
<P>
"It is fair to say that in the past years, the Council has
made some efforts towards resolving African issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
After U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan presented a
comprehensive report on Africa in April 1998, the Security Council
held open debates on the report and adopted a series of follow-up
actions.
</P>
<P>
Twice at the Council, in 1997 and 1998, meetings on the level
of foreign ministers were convened to discuss African issues. Last
year, the Council met many times to review the issue.
</P>
<P>
"We should also note, however, that what the Council has done
is far from enough," he said. "There is still 'more talk than deed
'."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, "China has always paid much attention to
the African issues, supported the legitimate demand and reasonable
position of African countries and participated actively in Council
deliberations on Africa," he said. "As a matter of fact, my
Government gave me specific instructions to postpone my date of
departure so that I will be present at last week's open debate on
the DRC and today's wrap-up."

<HEADLINE> Greece: 1988 Memorandum Good Basis for Athens-Ankara Rapprochement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Greece said Monday that a 1988
memorandum signed between Greece and Turkey on building confidence
can be a good basis for further rapprochement between the two
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that Greece wants rapprochement between the
two neighbors to be dealt with in "a positive spirit and strong
will" from both countries, adding that a good basis to use to
achieve positive results in this sector is the memorandum signed
between the then foreign ministers of the two countries in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The 1988 memorandum outlines a broad framework of agreed rules
of behavior regarding national military activities in the high
seas and international airspace aimed at reducing tension and
avoiding incidents between Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
For decades, Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have closely
gone to war three times over their territorial disputes in the
eastern Aegean Sea and the division problem of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors have since last June taken effective steps to
improve their strained relations, with the holding of "low-level"
talks in Ankara and Athens between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou has paid an

<HEADLINE> Black Market Cigarettes Inquiry Demanded in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Anti-smoking campaigners
demanded an inquiry on Monday into allegations that British
American Tobacco (BAT) had benefited from the black market sale of
its cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
But the tobacco giant rejected the allegations, saying it
worked to eradicate cigarette smuggling, the Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
Documents published on the Internet by anti-smoking campaigners
showed that smuggling was "integral to the operation of the
international cigarette market", according to the London-based
group Action on Smoking and health (ASH).
</P>
<P>
ASH claimed in a statement: "The documents show that BAT sought
to control markets...in the early 90s in ways that went well
beyond any acceptable standards of corporate behavior."
</P>
<P>
ASH accepted that BAT, which sells cigarette brands Kool,Kent
and Lucky Strike, had not itself been involved in smuggling.
</P>
<P>
ASH director Clive Bates said he had written to Stephen Byers,
Britain's Trade Secretary, to demand an inquiry into the matter.
</P>
<P>
"We call on the DTI (Department of Trade and Industry) to
launch an investigation into BAT's conduct. It is simply not
acceptable for British multinationals to act to undermine
legitimate tax policies in developing countries," Bates said.

<HEADLINE> EU Warns Austria's Integrating of Far-Rightists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The European Union warned on
Monday that it would not promote bilateral official contacts with
an Austrian government integrating the far-right Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the EU's Portuguese presidency after
consulting member states said that national governments of the
union would not promote or accept any bilateral official contacts
at political level with an Austrian government integrating the
extreme rightists.
</P>
<P>
The union will neither support in favor of Austrian candidates
seeking positions in international organizations and Austrian
ambassadors in European Union countries will only be received at a
technical level, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
This was the first official reaction from the European Union
concerning the possibility of extreme-right Freedom Party's
joining the Austrian coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel
warned that Austria would set a "serious precedent" if its far-
right Freedom Party joins the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Michel described Freedom Party chief Joerg Haider as a"
dangerous man" and said that the coalition role Haider's Freedom
Party is negotiating with the conservative People's Party could
lead to a snowballing effect of acceptance of extreme-right
politics in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"Europe has to know that if Haider gets a place in the
coalition government, the extreme rightists will cease to be
something unusual in the political scene," said the foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
He further warned that if the Freedom Party joins the
government, it might prompt the European Union (EU) to take
actions but he did not say what kind of actions.

<HEADLINE> Ivanov, Albright Hold Talks, Sign Pacts on Space, Nuke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Monday
held here talks on a series of issues of common concern and signed
two Russian-U.S. agreements on cooperation in space and nuclear
security.
</P>
<P>
Their talks lasted for almost four hours. Diplomatic sources
said that in the first half hour the meeting was held one-on-one
and later the delegations joined in. No details of the talks have
been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the Russian-U.S. talks focused on global
strategic stability and disarmament issues, including missile
defense and the reduction of strategic offensive armaments. The
sides also discussed pressing international and regional problems,
such as Kosovo and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
At a signing ceremony held at the Russian Foreign Ministry
after the meeting, Ivanov and Albright inked two accords on
bilateral cooperation in space and nuclear aspects.
</P>
<P>
The first document is an intergovernmental agreement concerning
the protection of technology used in the launching of U.S.-
licensed spacecraft from Russian facilities.
</P>
<P>
The pact is aimed at curbing unauthorized access to protected
technology related to the launching of spacecraft produced along
with the U.S. from the Plesetsk and Svobodny cosmodromes and the
Kapustin Yar launch facilities.
</P>
<P>
The other document Ivanov and Albright signed is a protocol
amending a bilateral agreement on establishing centers for
reducing the nuclear threat.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony, Ivanov and Albright gave a joint
news conference.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov call the meeting "constructive, frank and useful." The
two sides "reaffirmed their preparedness for expanded cooperation
and a greater atmosphere of stability and predictability in
bilateral relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
They paid special attention to Russian-U.S. consultations on
strategic offensive weapons and anti-missiles defense systems,
according to the Russian minister.
</P>
<P>
For her part, Albright said Russia has paid a great price in
its international reputation because of Chechnya, noting, however,
that no one disputes Moscow's right to combat terrorism.
</P>
<P>
U.S.-Russian negotiations on the possible revision of the 1972
ABM (Anti-Ballistic Missile) treaty cannot be finalized within a
day because the stakes are too high, Albright said.
</P>
<P>
She said they intend to reduce the matter to a common
denominator with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov and Albright expressed their conviction that the two
nations will be able to find satisfactory solutions to the issues
and problems concerning anti-ballistic missile defense systems and
START-2 (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty-2).
</P>
<P>
"The Russian leadership has confirmed and does confirm that it
will be steadily striving to ratify START-2," Ivanov said, adding
that it is necessary to look for "other solutions enabling us to
set a reliable controls on the proliferation of rocket technology.
"
</P>
<P>
As for European security problems, Albright said she had
welcomed Russia's statements on the need to give new impetus to
its relations with NATO.
</P>
<P>
On Chechnya, Albright said there are clear differences in the
positions of Moscow and Washington on this issue and warned that
Russia's ongoing military action in the breakaway republic could
lead to the country's further isolation in the world.
</P>
<P>
But Ivanov made a strong rebuff, saying that he thinks it
impossible to isolate Russia in fact.
</P>
<P>
"It is hardly justifiable to speak about Russia's being
isolated, and if there is any such isolation it is of a temporary
nature," Ivanov emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived in Moscow for a three-day official visit
Sunday night. Acting Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected
to receive Albright on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
She will also attend a ministerial meeting of the group for
multilateral talks on the Middle East peace process, which Russia
and the U.S. co-sponsored.

<HEADLINE> Life Sentence Given to UK Doctor Serial Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Britain's family doctor Harold
Shipman was sentenced to life in jail on Monday for murdering 15
of his mainly elderly patients with lethal injections of heroin.
</P>
<P>
Shipman, 54, a father of four, went down in history for being
the UK's biggest convicted serial killer.
</P>
<P>
The verdicts were read out by the foreman of a 12 person jury
at Preston Crown court in northwest England.
</P>
<P>
Shipman had denied all the charges.
</P>
<P>
It will be up to the Crown Prosecution Service to decide
whether he should now be charged and tried for these murders.
</P>
<P>
It is believed police have investigated a total of 136 Shipman
patients' deaths, including the 15 murders, and that they are
ready to proceed with another 23 cases.
</P>
<P>
The defense said the case against the doctor was based solely
on"unreliable and unsafe" toxicological evidence gathered after
the bodies of nine of the women were exhumed and traces of
diamorphine found in each of them.

<P>
HARARE, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Argentine entrepreneurs are
prepared to establish nuclear reactors in Zimbabwe to help it
alleviate fuel shortage, Argentine Ambassador to Zimbabwe Enrique
Pareja said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear reactors would also help generate electricity,
Pareja told reporters after meeting with Zimbabwe's Vice-President
Joseph Msika. He said: "We have submitted to the Zimbabwean
government the first set of the documents on the study to
establish the reactors. The people from Argentina are ready to
come to Zimbabwe to establish a nuclear plant."
</P>
<P>
He said the project was long-term, so it might take some years
before the plan was established.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is experiencing the worst fuel shortage since its
independence in 1980 with most businesses coming to a halt and
winding queues at filling stations.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Pareja said he also discussed with Msika
the three agreements on bilateral scientific, economic and
technical cooperation signed between Zimbabwean Foreign Minister
Stan Mudenge and his Argentine counterpart Guido DI Fella last
year.
</P>
<P>
The agreements would reinforce economic and social development
in both Argentina and Zimbabwe, he said.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Carry Out Restrictive Fiscal Policy in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government will
carry out a restrictive fiscal policy in the year 2000, with an
aim to gain control over the rampant inflation rate and the huge
public expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Under this policy, Angola's inflation rate in 2000 will not
exceed 87 percent as the growth rate of the country's Gross
National Product (GNP) will surpass three percent, said Angolan
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said through the restrictive fiscal measures, the country's
public deficit will be limited to six percent of the GNP.
However, the president did not predict the amount of the GNP in
2000.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, the government will this year make
effort to restrict the administrative expenditure within the
limits of a controllable deficit.
</P>
<P>
It will also keep its monetary policy consistent, slow down the
 inflation, maintain the convergence of the national currency and
rehabilitate the purchasing power of the wage earners, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for public investment, the president said, the government
will give priority to the sectors of health, education, culture,
social communication and sports in a bid to improve the quality of
the public service for the population.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government will also pay more attention to the
construction and maintenance of infrastructures as preparation for
further development, he said.

NAIROBI, January 31(Xinhua) -- Rwandan population, estimated at
273 people per square kilometers in 1997, has the highest density
in Africa, Rwanda News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted a socio-economic survey contained in a
United Nations Economic Commission for Africa report as saying
that Rwanda has an annual population growth estimated at 3.6
percent per year and a crude birth rate estimated at 43.3 per 1000
people.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the population densities for Burundi, Uganda,
South Africa and Zimbabwe are only 245, 99, 33 and 29 people per
square kilometers, respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the annual population growth for

<HEADLINE> Europeans Not to Marginalize NATO: Robertson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General George
Robertson said Monday that the European Security and Defense
Identity is not designed to marginalize the North Atlantic Treaty
Alliance (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Addressing a conference on defense, the former British foreign
secretary said the European Security and Defense Identity is
designed to strengthen NATO's ability to respond to future crises
instead of reducing them.
</P>
<P>
Robertson said the fear that NATO's pursuit of such an organ
would otherwise marginalize NATO or the United States is simply
not right.
</P>
<P>
The proposal of the European Security and Defense Identity,
raised at the European Union summit last December in Helsinki of
Finland, caused anxieties of the United States which said it would
weaken the alliance's leading role that has existed for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
The trans-Atlantic relationship is and will remain solid, said
Robertson who replaced Javier Solona as head of the 19-member NATO.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Britain and France proposed to quicken the pace of
building the European Security and Defense Identity that will use
the existing assets of NATO in dealing with crises in Europe.
</P>
<P>
NATO, however, announced on January 22 that a five-European-
nation Eurocorps would take over the day-to-day patrolling duties
in Kosovo in April as a step to shape the European Security and
Defense Identity.
</P>
<P>
The Eurocorps consists of troops from France, Germany, Spain,
Belgium and Luxembourg.

WASHINGTON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Darrell Walker, a former
Washington Bullets guard, will be named the Washington Wizards'
interim coach today, president of basketball operations Michael
Jordan said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The decision to hire Walker was made after the club's plan to
hire Golden State Warriors assistant coach Rod Higgins came apart
when the Warriors demanded compensation, a league source said.
</P>
<P>
"I felt we should (make the coaching change) now while we still
can salvage something of the season," Jordan told the Washington
Post in a telephone interview. "That doesn't guarantee anything,
but I feel we've got to change the attitude on this team. We've
got to kick-start the team and that starts with the coach."
</P>
<P>
Walker, 38, will replace Gar Head, who was fired Satureday
night in the Wizards' first major move since Jordan joined the
organization 11 days ago. He will be introduced at a news
conference this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Walker, who coached the Toronto Raptors to a 41-90 record from
April 1996 to February 1998, has been coaching the CBA's Rockfort
Lightning this season.
</P>

Wes Unseld, no the Wizards' general Manager, coached the team -

<HEADLINE> Turkey Supports Confederation Formula in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Ankara views a proposal for
setting up a "confederation of two states" on Cyprus as the "most
realistic and viable model" for solving the Cyprus issue, said the
Foreign Ministry in a statement on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as a U.N.-brokered two-week proximity talks
on Cyprus kicked off in Geneva, Switzerland during the day.
</P>
<P>
The proximity talks are aimed at paving the way for negotiations
that may lead to a comprehensive settlement between Greek Cypriots
and Turkish Cypriots, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
However, both Greece and Greek Cypriots have rejected a
confederal solution to the Cyprus issue, insisting on a bi-zonal
and bi-communal federation formula.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
Mediterranean island in the wake of an aborted coup in Nicosia
seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been trying for decades to reunite the
divided island, but no tangible results have been achieved so far.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots put forward a proposal on August 31, 1998,
that a confederation formed by two sovereign states be set up in
Cyprus and their "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC)",
backed solely by Ankara, be recognized in talks with Nicosia on
equal basis.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey, as one of the two motherlands and a guarantee state,
fully supports the views of the TRNC and appreciates the
constructive leadership of Rauf Denktash, president of the TRNC, in
the efforts to seek a secure and lasting compromise between the two
states in Cyprus," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It argued that the acknowledgement of the equal status of the
two peoples and the two states remains to be an "indispensable
starting point for the formation of the necessary ground for
meaningful negotiations and proceeding to a comprehensive
settlement on this ground."

Greek Cypriot leader Glafcos Clerides met with Denktash last
December in New York during their first round of proximity talks

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Corporate India Enters New Century With a Bang  by Xiong Changyi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Corporate India has entered
the new millennium with a bang, seeing a sharp rise in profits and
sales turnover.
</P>
<P>
A study by a leading Indian financial daily Business Standard
indicated last week that 210 companies showed a 43.9-percent rise
in profits for the third quarter (October-December) of the 1999-
2000 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
It is not only bottom lines, even sales turnover of these
companies increased by 20.6 percent. These companies are also
optimistic that this show continued in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
The third-quarter performance also confirms a recent survey
conducted by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), the
premier industry chamber in the country.
</P>
<P>
The CII survey for April-November 1999 indicated that passenger
cars grew by 44 percent, medium and heavy commercial vehicles by
68 percent, personal computers by 40 percent, color TV sets by 25
percent,audio products by 25 percent and sugar by 53.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The index of industrial production for April-November 1999
stood higher at 6.4 percent as against 3.6 percent recorded in the
same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a higher volume growth, Reliance Industries, the
largest private-sector company in India, surprised analysts by
registering a 56-percent rise in its net profit to 6.27 billion
rupees (145.81 million U.S. dollars) for October-December in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the information technology sector again overshadowed
others and led the corporate brigade's resurgence by showing a
remarkable rise in bottom lines during the period.
</P>
<P>
Over a dozen software firms reported an average net profit
growth of 75 percent and sales growth of 60 percent, setting the
stock market bulls on fire.
</P>
<P>
Software blue-chip Infosys Technologies, the first Indian
company to list on the U.S. Nasdaq, announced a 84-percent jump in
net profit and a 67-percent surge in sales while NIIT Limited's
profit more than doubled and Satyam Computer Services Limited 's
profit went up by 83 percent. The profit of India's largest
software firm, Wipro, zoomed by 215 percent.
</P>
<P>
The sharp rise in profits and sales turnover indicated that the
current fiscal year will be a strong turnaround story for the
corporate sector, ending a decade of restructuring and
consolidation.
</P>
<P>
This is also a strong signal that the Indian industry has
successfully survived the first phase of the economic reform
process.
</P>
<P>
With better corporate performance, analysts are now predicting
a higher tax inflow for the government. Total tax collection in
April-December 1999 rose to 1.135 trillion rupees (26.4 billion
dollars) as against 970.53 billion rupees (22.57 billion dollars)
recorded a year ago.
</P>
<P>
This will help the Indian economy sustain an average 6- to 7.5-
percent growth per annum in the next five years, making it one of
the fastest growing economies in the world, analysts said.

KAMPALA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The police chief of Uganda's
capital urged residents on Monday to report crimes to police
authorities in order to improve security situation and bring down
rate of violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
"Security is not only the problem facing the police officers.
We are at present short of manpower and equipment. All citizens
should watch out for crimes," said Kampala Police Commander
Benjamin Namanya in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Armed robberies are on the increase because there are more than
10,000 guns owned by civilians in Kampala alone, the commander
said. He challenged those who possess weapons legally to take good
care of them.
</P>
<P>
He said that civilians could contribute to security by
providing clues which are indispensable to tracking down
criminals.

<HEADLINE> Mbeki Calls on Developing Countries to Be United in Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, SWITZERLAND, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Developing countries
should take a concerted stand in the new round of trade talks to
defend their own interests, South African President Thabo Mbeki
said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question by Xinhua at the press conference on the
sidelines of the 30th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (
WEF), Mbeki said that to ensure the new round to be the "
development round," the developing countries should play an active
role in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the gap between the developing countries and the
developed countries are widening in the digital society. To narrow
the gap, the developing countries have to enhance trade relations
among themselves.
</P>
<P>
The South African president said that his country is expanding
trade cooperation with other developing countries including China,
Brazil and India.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is important for the developing countries to be
united as one. Pointing out that poverty is not a problem only for
the developing nations, he said that the developed countries
should also do something in this regard to bridge the gap between
the two.

<HEADLINE> French Truckers Block Border Crossing with Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- French truck drivers have
blocked the border crossing with Belgium, demanding for shorter
work hours and higher pay, local media reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Belgian police have been diverting the traffic from the E17
European Highway between Kortrijk and Lille since the blockade
started Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The truckers have blocked highways at different locations in
France and more actions are expected at ferry ports and oil
refineries, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the French road haulage companies organized
a strike to protest against the decisions on work hours by the
government which would cut the standard work hours from 39 to 35 a
week. They argued that the reduced work hours would force them to
add more staff.
</P>
<P>
While the French government gave in to demands of the transport
company bosses for tax cuts on fuel and the right to work more
than 35 hours a week, the unions said they had been excluded from
relevant talks.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Stresses Importance of Sufficient Nuclear Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
said on Monday that France must keep a reliable and sure nuclear
deterrence force to protect its vital interests.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the army monthly "Armee d'aujourd'hui"
published on Monday, Chirac said the nuclear forces maintained at
a strictly sufficient level are the ultimate guarantee of the
nation's survival.
</P>
<P>
France's nuclear forces include submarine nuclear launchers and
strategic bombers with nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
"The forces don't threaten anyone, but they make it sure that
whoever attacks our vital interests will suffer unacceptable
damages which are out of the proportion of the stakes of the
conflict in return," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that although France has built a "reliable and sure"
nuclear force after its nuclear tests in 1995 and 1996, it should
adapt its force with a maximum of flexibility to all the possible
changes in the security situation.
</P>
<P>
"As long as the risks exist and we have not attained a general
and controlled disarmament... France should keep the capacity to
protect itself against any threat on its vital interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
France has stopped all nuclear tests after signing the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996, but continues to make
simulation nuclear tests to guarantee the reliability of its
nuclear warheads.

GUILIN, January 31 (Xinhua)-- A heavy snowfall paid an
unexpected visit to Guilin, the renowned tourist destination in
south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, early this morning.
</P>
<P>
This was the heaviest snow in Guilin in a decade, according to
the local meteorological bureau.

Though the temperature fell to an unusual zero degree Celsius
today, the local people were rather excited and enjoying
themselves in the silver world created by the snow.

</P>
<P>
"I'm so happy today to see snow in the new millennium", said

<HEADLINE> Head of Taliban Ruling Council Arrives in Islamabad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Afghan
Taliban's Council of Ministers Mullah Muhammad Rabbani arrived
here Monday for a two-day visit to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The second-highest ranking official in the Taliban hierarchy,
accompanied by 16 other officials, including eight ministers, came
to Pakistan by road due to a U.N. ban on air links with
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Rabbani is expected to hold a meeting
with Pakistan's Chief Executive General Pervez Musharraf and call
on Pakistani President Rafiq Tarar.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministers accompanying Rabbani will hold
meetings with their Pakistani counterparts.
</P>
<P>
These meetings will provide an opportunity to discuss subjects
such as transit trade, supply of wheat, repatriation of Afghan
refugees and other matters of mutual interest, said an official
press release here.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan tightened controls on Afghan transit trade last year
in order to curb rampant smuggling of the goods in transit.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani told reporters in Landikotal, a Pakistani border town,
that his visit was aimed at further cementing relations between
Pakistan and the Taliban regime.
</P>
<P>
He said the Taliban's relations with Iran had significantly
improved.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said Rabbani is likely to discuss with
Pakistan possible talks between the Taliban and its opposition
since Pakistan and Iran recently reached an agreement to
coordinate their efforts for the peaceful settlement of the civil
war in their common neighbor.

<HEADLINE> India Sets End of Cross-Border "Terrorism" as Precondition for Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 31 (Xinhua) -- India reiterated on Monday
its position that Pakistan must first stop "cross-border terrorism
" in Jammu and Kashmir and elsewhere in India and create a
conducive atmosphere before New Delhi could consider resuming
talks with Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
"Our position remains the same," said a Foreign Office
spokesman in response to a question about Pakistan's military
ruler General Pervez Musharraf's offer to meet Indian Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
The local media reported that Musharraf had said he was ready
for a meeting with Vajpayee provided the "centrality" of the
Kashmir issue in Indo-Pak relations was accepted.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi has insisted that for any talks to be meaningful,
there had to be first cessation of "cross-border terrorism" by
Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Euro Zone Posts Trade Surplus Last November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The 11-nation euro zone
registered a trade surplus of 4 billion euros (3.9 billion U.S.
dollars) with the rest of the world last November, Eurostat
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The statistical bureau of the European Union said that the 15-
nation union, however, posted a trade deficit of 2.6 billion euros
(2.54 billion dollars) with non-EU countries in the same month.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, the euro zone trade surplus with the rest of the
world was 7.2 billion euros (7.16 billion dollars) in November
1998 and the EU had an extra-EU trade surplus of 1.6 billion euros
(1.54 billion dollars ) in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, EU exports to China and the United States increased 11
percent and 10 percent respectively while its imports from Hungary
and China grew 17 percent and 14 percent, according to Luxembourg-
based Eurostat.
</P>
<P>
Among EU members, Germany enjoyed the largest surplus at 54.6
billion euros (53.3 billion dollars) whereas Britain had the
largest deficit of 41.9 billion euros (40.9 billion dollars).
Ireland continued to show the strongest trade growth to have the
second largest surplus at 19.9 billion euros (19.4 billion dollars)
.

<HEADLINE> Euro Zone Confident in Single Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The 11-nation euro zone Monday
showed confidence in the weakening single currency as its finance
ministers met here in a scheduled meeting.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after formal discussion, the euro zone
finance ministers said they shared the view with the European
Central Bank (ECB) that the euro zone sees robust growth currently
which is increasingly rooted in domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
"As a consequence," said the statement, "the euro has potential
for appreciation, firmly based on growth and internal price
stability. A strong economy goes along with a strong currency."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, European Union Finance Commissioner Pedro Solbes said
it seemed unnecessary to intervene in the foreign exchange market
to bolster the falling euro.
</P>
<P>
The euro fell as low as 0.9739 against U.S. dollar last Friday,
a more than 16-percent drop from its introduction last year. It
was introduced into the international market trading with U.S.
dollar at 1:1.17.
</P>
<P>
The euro's latest record dive below the one-dollar mark raised
pressure on the ECB to increase interest rates in the coming weeks
to curb inflation pressures.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the finance ministers promised to continue
fiscal consolidation and make a common commitment to strengthening
the structural reform process to ensure a high and non-
inflationary level of growth in the euro zone.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland, China to Further Cement Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- President of the Swiss
Federation Adolf Ogi and Head of Federal Department of Foreign
Affairs Joseph Deiss met Chinese Vice Premier Wu Bangguo in Bern
on Monday with both sides pledging to further strengthen bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
Wu extended the cordial regards of Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji to President Ogi. He said Switzerland
was one of the first western countries to acknowledge the New
China. The bilateral relations between both countries have
witnessed continuous development over the past 50 years since they
established diplomatic ties. The development has been especially
rapid since China's reform and opening-up. Leaders of both
countries have maintained constant contact and the two heads of
state have also paid successful mutual visits.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said, bilateral trade relations have developed very
rapidly, and their economic and technological cooperation enjoys
bright prospects for development.
</P>
<P>
He said China highly appreciates the Swiss government's
positive attitude toward and efforts for the development of the
Sino-Swiss ties.
</P>
<P>
"China attaches great importance to its ties with Switzerland
and its unique role in international affairs," said Wu. He added
that he contacted people from all walks of life during the visit
and has felt their enthusiasm in developing Sino-Swiss ties.
</P>
<P>
"This is very favorable to the further development of bilateral
ties and we'd like to join hands with Switzerland to push the
further development of China-Switzerland relations in the new
century," observed the Chinese leader.
</P>
<P>
President Ogi warmly welcomed Wu's visit to Switzerland on the
50th anniversary of the establishment of Sino-Swiss diplomatic
ties.
</P>
<P>
He said over the past 50 years, both countries have established
good rapport in various fields and deepened mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
He said that since China started the reform and opening drive,
its economy has secured rapid growth and great achievements have
been made in all fields. He was deeply impressed by all these
accomplishments during his visit to China last year.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the Swiss government actively supports
the development of China-Switzerland ties and believes that the
cooperative ties between the two countries will grow steadily.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice premier also met Head of Federal Department of
Economic affairs Pascal Couchepin Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who is in charge of China's industrial and communications
sectors, arrived in Switzerland on Wednesday for a six-day
official visit. Earlier, he had visited Britain and Belgium.

She made the remarks during a meeting with Legislative
Councilors Emily Lau and James To and five representatives of non-
governmental organizations. Comprehensive and constructive
discussions on a wide range of security-related issues were held
in the course of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
On legislative proposals to implement Article 23 of the Basic
Law, Ip explained that the article provides that the Hong Kong SAR
shall enact laws on its own to prohibit any act of treason,
secession, sedition and subversion against the Central People's
Government, theft of state secrets, political activities of
foreign political bodies and ties with foreign political bodies.
</P>
<P>
In regard to a request for an independent Police Complaints
Council, Ip reiterated that the administration does not see such a
need since effective checks and balances have been built into the
existing system to ensure that complaints are handled thoroughly
and impartially.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in view of technological change and legal and
judicial developments in other jurisdictions, the SAR government
is thoroughly reviewing the whole issue, taking into account the
feedback received, the latest legislation and practices adopted
overseas, so as to map out the best way forward.
</P>
<P>
"We will complete the review as soon as we can and it is our
intention to put forward revised proposals to the next term of the

HONG KONG, January 31 (Xinhua) -- An "Employment Information
Workshop" for trainees of the Youth Pre-employment Training
Program (YPTP) will be held by the Labor Department of Hong Kong
on February 26.
</P>
<P>
Through this employment service, trainees will be able to
acquire the latest employment market information, look for
suitable job vacancies and register at the workshop.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the graduation ceremony of the Job Attachment
Program run by the Hong Kong Jockey Club under the YPTP Monday,
Commissioner for Labor Matthew Cheung Kin-chung encouraged
trainees to make full use of the workshop.
</P>
<P>
"Some 1,800 trainees under the YPTP have successfully found
jobs so far since the YPTP started last September," he said,
pointing out that the employment market was constantly changing.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to expertise and experience, employees must update
themselves with new knowledge and skills so as to keep up with the
rapidly changing market. Self-upgrading, keeping in pace with the
environment and life-long learning are basically the spirit of the
program," he said.
</P>
<P>
The YPTP, launched in September last year, provides young
school leavers aged between 15 and 19 the opportunity to receive a
wide range of employment-related training and counseling, thereby
improving their employability.
</P>
<P>
On completion of the program modules, trainees have the
opportunity to go through workplace attachments to experience the
working environment personally.

<HEADLINE> First Batch of Master Trust Schemes Announced in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Mandatory Provident Fund
Schemes Authority (MPFA) announced Monday a list of Master Trust
Schemes that are ready to be introduced to the MPF market from
February 1.
</P>
<P>
The authority also showed samples of the 20,000 MPF
Intermediaries Cards that have been issued so far.
</P>
<P>
Forty-two Master Trust Schemes comprising 243 constituent funds
have been registered. With the registration of this first batch of
Master Trust Schemes and the MPF intermediaries, MPF scheme
providers can from Tuesday approach eligible employers and self-
employed persons.
</P>
<P>
"These schemes have been stringently vetted by the authority to
ensure that they comply with the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes
Ordinance, Regulations, Codes on MPF Investment Funds and other
guidelines issued by the MPFA," said Alan Wong, acting managing
director of the MPFA.
</P>
<P>
The Master Trust Scheme is open to relevant employees and self-
employed persons. By pooling the contributions of small employer
units together for administration and investment, such Master
Trust Schemes can enjoy a high degree of efficiency resulting from
economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
"Only qualified and properly registered MPF intermediaries are
allowed to sell or advise on MPF products," said Raymond Tam,
executive director of the MPFA.
</P>
<P>
The MPF schemes, designed to provide retirement protection for
the three million-strong workforce in Hong Kong, require employees
to contribute five percent of their monthly salaries and their
employers the same amount.
</P>
<P>
All contributions will be entrusted to privately managed
trustees approved by the MPFA for administration and investment.

provoked by Pakistan in the region of Jammu and Kashmir.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Describes Peace as Key to Middle East Prosperity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, SWITZERLAND, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Peace and free
markets are important to prosperity and stability in the Middle
East, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the plenary session at the 30th annual meeting of
the World Economic Forum (WEF), Arafat said, "This just and
comprehensive peace which is based on the freedom of people and
markets will in turn create the proper environment to establish a
strong regional economy that will revive our area again, and
enable it to catch up with the rest of the world."
</P>
<P>
He said the peace will also help to integrate the Middle East
with the world economy and to give it the chance to gain new
opportunities, which will make it more capable of utilizing its
human and natural resources for the benefit of its own peoples.
</P>
<P>
"Peace and freedom will open up the Middle East to regional
cooperation and joint ventures in the fields of high technology,
tourism, transportation, telecommunication, and other mega
projects that we have dreamed of for so long," said Arafat, also
Chairman of the Palestinian Liberation Organization Executive
Committee.
</P>
<P>
"These projects will provide the peoples of the Middle East
with water, energy, and shared growth opportunities, and will
enable us to transform the area in a way that can attract foreign
capital and technology," he said. "All this will open the door for
Palestine to develop as an emerging economy in the context of a
more integrated, and more developed regional economy."
</P>
<P>
Arafat urged the international community to give support for
the ongoing negotiations on the transitional period and the final
status of Jerusalem in a bid to achieve the peace.
</P>
<P>
"These negotiations are proceeding very, very slowly," said
Arafat, adding that the whole process has been threatened by
delayed fulfilment or failure to full implementation of the agreed
measures.
</P>
<P>
He urged a prompt action to save the peace process and help the
region move forward towards a new century of peace, freedom and
prosperity.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Sees Rise of Austria's Far-Rightist Party as Danger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Belgian Foreign Minister Louis
Michel said Monday that Austria would set a "serious precedent" if
its far-rightist Freedom Party joins the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper Le Soir quoted Michel as saying that
President of the Freedom Party Joerg Haider is a "dangerous man"
and that the coalition role his party is negotiating with the
conservative People's Party could lead to a snowball effect of
acceptance of extreme-rightist politics in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"Europe has to know that if Haider gets a place in the
coalition government, the extreme rightists will cease to be
something unusual in the political scene," said Michel.
</P>
<P>
He warned if the Freedom Party joins the government, it might
prompt the European Union (EU) to take actions, but he failed to
say what kind of actions.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt proposed last week that
the 15-nation EU should call a special meeting of foreign
ministers to discuss the issue. Yet his proposal has so far
received no public response from the EU's Portuguese presidency.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission's press service said Monday it has not
got any idea from Portugal about the proposed meeting. Portugal
took the six-month rotating presidency from Finland in January.

LONDON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Belgium and six human rights
groups Monday lost their legal bid to challenge Britain's decision
to free Augusto Pinochet, paving the way for him to return home.
</P>
<P>
They have appealed against British Home Secretary Jack Straw's
handling of the Pinochet case and challenged that Straw's refusal
to release details of the former Chilean leader's medical
condition was unfair.
</P>
<P>
But judge Morris Kay at the British High Court Monday refused
permission for judicial review of Straw's decision, saying that
the British home secretary had acted "lawfully, fairly and
rationally in the consultation process" and in his decision not to
disclose Pinochet's medical evidence.
</P>
<P>
The ruling means that general Pinochet could be allowed to fly
home within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Belgium Monday expressed their disappointment of British High
Court's ruling and planned to appeal against it.

<HEADLINE> Ottey to Compete in Valencia Indoor Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Jamacian sprinter Merlene Ottey
will run in the Valencia indoor athletics meeting on February 2
despite being embroiled in a doping controversy, the tournament
organisers said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the organisers Unipublic said Ottey, 39,
would compete in the 60 meters and possibly the 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
Ottey said at the weekend that she still planned to run in
Valencia, which will now be her first race since the announcement
of a positive test for the banned steroid nandrolone last summer.
</P>
<P>
Unipublic said that no pressure has yet been put upon them, by
either the Spanish athletics federation (RFEA) or the
International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) to withdraw their
invitiation to Ottey.
</P>
<P>
However RFEA president Jose Maria Odriozola said that he will
urge the meeting organisers to reconsider their position.
</P>
<P>
"We can't oblige them to do anything because legally she is not
banned. But it would be bad for athletics. It also gives the
impression that in Spain we are soft on doping," Odriozola said.
</P>
<P>
Ottey produced a positve dope test at a meeting in Lucerne on
July 5 but the news only emerged on August 18, two days before the
start of the world championships in Seville in which she was due
to compete for a record seventh time.
</P>
<P>
Ottey has vowed to clear her name and has strenuously denied
all allegations of drug-taking.
</P>
<P>
The Jamaican federation subsequently cleared Ottey, who has won
14 world championship medals and seven Olympic medals, of any
wrongdoing in November.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF have yet to accept the decision and has convened its
arbitration panel but under its regulations Ottey is entitled to
race until the sport's governing body bans her.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Banking Sector to Meet Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Branch of the
People's Bank of China will enhance its competitiveness to meet
challenges that may rise following China's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO), a senior banker said today.
</P>
<P>
At a working conference of the branch held here in Shanghai,
China's number one economic and financial center, branch director
Wu Xiaoling said the branch and the neighboring Zhejiang and
Fujian provinces under its jurisdiction must step up the reform in
setup, personnel affairs and distribution and encourage
shareholding and new lines of business in the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of last year, the GDP in
Shanghai and Zhejiang and Fujian reached 403.5 billion yuan, 535
billion yuan and 357 billion yuan, respectively, (1 U.S.dollar is
equal to about 8.3 yuan), increasing by about 10 percent over
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The savings deposits and credit loans in yuan of the banks of
the region amounted to 1.63 trillion yuan and 1.23 trillion yuan,
up 15.19 and 15.86 percent over 1998 respectively, higher than the
national average.
</P>
<P>
Wu said this year the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of
China will further bring into full play the role of the monetary
policy and support the effort to drive domestic demand while
preventing financial risks.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the banks in the region to popularize commercial
discounting business, increase individual housing loans and
economic housing development loans, investment in infrastructure
projects, simplify procedures on loans to the farming sector, and
suspend or cease loans to losing enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that in order to face the challenges that may come from
China's entry into the WTO, the banking sector is expected to
update its concepts of management and financial supervision and
raise their capabilities to resist financial risks.

BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- When Wu Kunling registered his
Investment Consultant Office with the Beijing Administration for
Industry and Commerce (BAIC) today.
</P>
<P>
He established the first individual proprietorship in the city
after the Law on Enterprises under Sole Individual Proprietorship
(LESIP) went into effect on January 1.
</P>
<P>
Wu, 37, who invest 200,000 yuan (22,000 US dollars), said his
business will include consultation services, conference organizing,
training programs, translation services, and corporate image
design.
</P>
<P>
Wanting to be his own boss, Wu said the LESIP offers him this
opportunity, and he will first of all try to build a reputation
for his office.
</P>
<P>
He Qingcai, an official with BAIC, said that an individual
owner such as Wu Kunling is highly motivated because he is
operating his own business with his own money and therefore has
unlimited liabilities.
</P>
<P>
Even though the LESIP makes it easier for individuals to run
their own businesses, He said he does not agree with the rumor
that one can set up a company with one dollar, because one dollar
will not earn a reputation for a company.
</P>
<P>
Officials with BAIC said that the registration of new
businesses under the new law will continue.

<TEXT>
<P>
Lee's "two states" statement exposed his true intent to split
the motherland, and this goes against the trend of peace across
the Straits and the country's reunification course.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Chinese government,
along with all the Chinese people, have fought staunchly against
Lee Teng-hui and his supporters who are promoting the "two states"
statement.
</P>
<P>
We should spare no effort to uncompromisingly continue the
struggle against any activities meant to split Taiwan from the
motherland, the participants noted.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, further progress has been achieved in
cross-Straits exchanges in the economy, culture, trade, and
science and technology, and according to government statistics,
Beijing and Taiwan have carried out 745 exchange programs, and
about 1.5 million Taiwan people visited Beijing in the period.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Beijing has sent 2,839 professionals to visit
Taiwan. By the end of 1999, Taiwan businesspeople had set up some
1,656 projects in Beijing involving a total investment of 1.29
billion US dollars.

<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- People from all walks of life
participated in a forum here today to mark the 5th anniversary of
the publication of President Jiang Zemin's eight-point proposition
on reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Those gathered hailed the eight-point proposition as a "
programmatic document for developing relations across the Taiwan
Straits and realizing peaceful reunification of the motherland."
</P>
<P>
They noted that Jiang's 1995 speech on the Taiwan issue
expounded the essence of Deng Xiaoping's theory of "peaceful
reunification, one country, two systems." On that occasion, Jiang
put forward the eight-point proposition for advancing cross-
Straits relations and promoting the peaceful reunification of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland has proved
the correctness and feasibility of the eight-point proposition,
they said. It also greatly inspired the Chinese people, including
Taiwan compatriots, to have absolute confidence and determination
to make contributions to resolving the Taiwan issue as soon as
possible and realize the peaceful reunification of China.

religious freedom and unswervingly lead religious groups to cater
to the country's socialist development, a top official pledged
here today to a group of China's religious leaders.

He explained that the policy is consistent with communist
theory that the natural laws governing the existence and
development of religions cannot be disrupted by governments, and
it is consistent with the ultimate goal of the CPC and the Chinese
government to serve the people wholeheartedly, and protect the
legal rights, including the right to religious belief or disbelief,
of all the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the policy reflects the Chinese traditional value
which stresses "harmony and unity of differences," Li said.
</P>
<P>
All the major religions in China propagate the ideas of loving
the motherland, serving the society, aspiring to good and lofty
ideals, and abandoning evils, all of which are positive factors
for social progress, Li added.
</P>

He asked all religious leaders and religious groups to do
their utmost to protect the dignity of state laws, protect the
interests of the people, protect unity among ethnic groups, and
protect national unity.

<HEADLINE> 2 Israeli Soldiers Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli soldiers were killed
and several others injured on Monday in an attack launched by
Lebanese guerrillas, Lebanese security officials said.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas waged the attack on an Israeli patrol near the
Israeli outpost at Beaufort, overlooking southern Lebanon and
northern Israel, before midday, the unnamed officials said.
</P>
<P>
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
The attack came one day after Akl Hachem, the No. 2 man of the
Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army(SLA), was killed when the Iran-
backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, detonated a roadside bomb in
Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The latest attack brings to three the number of Israeli soldiers
killed in Lebanon since the beginning of this year. One soldier was
killed last Tuesday in a rocket attack by the guerrillas in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a 15-kilometer deep border strip in south
Lebanon in 1985 as a self-styled security zone to buffer
guerrillas' cross border attacks. Lebanese resistance groups have
ever since been fighting to oust 1,500 Israeli troops and their 2,
500 allied militiamen out of the zone.

spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said on Monday his country rejects
foreign interference in its internal affairs, particularly the

Asefi's statement came in response to the remarks recently made

about the future elections is an indication of their lack of
information about the Iranian people and community, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also denied rumors of an alleged proposal by the
European Union (EU) to dispatch observers to Iran to monitor the
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
So far no such proposal has been offered by the EU and Iran's
policy is clear in this respect, he said.
</P>
<P>
The experience of many elections in the past has proven that
Iran is capable of sound management of any elections without
needing the presence of any observers or envoys, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the prevalence of different tendencies and ideas in the
society is a manifestation of freedom and institutionalization of
democracy in his country.
</P>
<P>
While the Interior Ministry announced that the election
campaigns will officially kick off on February 10, rival parties
and groups have already started their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives, who dominate most important state organs of
the country, hope to strengthen their control on the parliament,
while the moderates, main supporters of President Mohammad Khatami,
expect to win a majority in the powerful legislative body to push
forward Khatami's reformist programs.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the U.S. severed diplomatic ties in 1980 after the U.S.
embassy in Tehran was occupied by Iranian students in the heyday of
the 1979 Islamic revolution. 
</P>
<P>
After Iran's moderate President Khatami came to power in 1997,
Tehran and Washington lowed down their hostile tune against each
other and some U.S. officials have called for unconditional talks
between the two sides for normal ties.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Become World Food Center in 5 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has the potential to
become a world food hub in the next five years, judging by the
continuous trade surplus on agricultural products in the past
years, Thai Farmers' Bank Research Center said in a report
available Monday.
</P>
<P>
The prominent research center said the trade surplus on Thai
food, including seafood, canned vegetables and fruits, and other
processed food, have been maintained over the past years.
</P>
<P>
The country's trade surplus on agricultural products were at
319.7 billion baht (8.57 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998, while that
of 1999 and 2000 were estimated at 278.9 billion baht (7.47
billion dollars) and 281.6 billion baht (7.54 billion dollars),
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed that the country has maintained its trade
surplus on exports of agricultural products even after the
economic crisis broke out in 1997, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has set a target to make Bangkok a "world
supermarket" with its food supply widely reaching population
worldwide by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
To reach the goal, the research center suggested that Thai food
products exporters boost their competitiveness by following the
world trends and obtaining more accesses to information.
</P>
<P>
It also said that problems such as uncertainty of outputs,
rising production costs and heavy reliance on imported raw
materials should be properly addressed.

DAR ES SALAAM, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Burundian government
has recently released more than 80,000 civilians who were forced
to live in 10 "regroupment camps", Tanzanian media reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the 10 camps was a response to an earlier call
by the United Nations Security Council, which condemned the
practice as a violation of international law, the Guardian
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the UN Security Council earlier this month, former
South African President and the mediator for the Burundi peace
talks Nelson Mandela blamed leaders of the central African nation
for allowing the six- year civil war, which has claimed 200,000
lives, to go unabated and herding civilians into "regroupment
camps".
</P>
<P>
More than 350,000 civilians have been forcibly relocated in
more than 50 regroupment camps by Burundi's Tutsi-dominated
government to prevent Hutu rebels getting support from the
population.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- A British Airways plane carrying
122 passengers from Washington DC Monday made an emergency landing
at Heathrow Airport after one of its four engines failed, the BBC
reported.
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the incident which followed alerts
involving two BA Concorde jets which made emergency landings
earlier at Heathrow, the report said.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, a Concorde which had just taken off from the airport
turned back and landed at about 1330 GMT after a warning light
came on in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
A BA spokeswoman said the pilot performed an emergency landing
25 minutes after take-off.
</P>
<P>
Heathrow was put on full alert as the chartered flight carrying
100 passengers touched down. But later checks found it was a false
alert.
</P>
<P>
Only hours earlier, a different Concorde, on a flight from
Barbados, suffered a failure of one of its four engines on its
approach to Heathrow.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft landed safely, seven minutes before its scheduled
arrival time on Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
BA said an inquiry would be held into the causes of the engine
failure and stressed there were no links between the incidents.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman said passengers had not been at risk in the latest
incident as the jet can easily fly on one engine.
</P>
<P>
The airline said that the emergency landings were purely
coincidental and no extra checks of Concordes were planned.

<HEADLINE> Britain Is Years Away From Joining Euro: Cook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said on Monday that Britain will not join the single European
currency in the next few years, after a poll suggested record
hostility to Britain's euro entry.
</P>
<P>
Following remarks from the head of the European Central Bank,
Wim Duisenberg, that Britain is "many years" away from joining the
euro, Cook said that this was the common sense view.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to be joining the euro in a year or two,
therefore there I have no disagreement with him," Cook told the
BBC Radio.
</P>
<P>
Duisenberg said in the weekend that British economy was a long
way off reaching convergence with its European counterparts and
may not be able to join the euro soon even if the government
wanted to.
</P>
<P>
Cook's remarks came as a poll carried out for BBC Radio 4's
Today program suggested that a new high of anti-euro sentiment has
been reached by the public.
</P>
<P>
In the survey, 69 percent of voters said they were opposed to
the pound being replaced by the euro. Only 53 percent of those
polled were in favor of staying in the European Union (EU) itself,
with 34 percent backing withdrawal, a position not advocated by
any mainstream British political party.
</P>
<P>
Britain is due to hold a referendum on entry into the single
currency once its five economic tests have been met.
</P>
<P>
With the vote is not on the immediate political horizon, Cook
said: "There is no problem for us in the fact that most people
agree that we should not be joining now."
</P>
<P>
But he said the government will "continue to make the case" for
what he said were the benefits of joining the new currency, which
included safeguarding British jobs.

<HEADLINE> AFC to Focus on Youth Soccor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Football
Confederation (AFC) said Monday its main agenda in the new
millenium is to develop youth soccer programs.
</P>
<P>
Such agenda will be given priority in efforts to improve the
standard of football in the region, AFC General-Secretary Peter
Velappan said after attending a FIFA Referees and Assistant
Referees Seminar here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The AFC has made the Year 2000 as the "Youth Football Year"
where more age group competitions will be held, Velappan said.
</P>
<P>
The AFC encourages people in the region to play football at a
young age to master basics of the game, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We (AFC) will focus on more of such programs to make affliates
aware of its importance," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that among Asian nations who had shown tremendous
improvement from youth development programs were Japan when they
emerged runners-up in the World Youth Cup in Nigeria last April.
</P>
<P>
He said Japan had also produced international stars like
Hidetoshi Nakata who is now playing for AS Roma in the Italian
Serie A.
</P>
<P>
Velappan also noted that the AFC would also ensure that soccer
bodies were smoothly run to facilitate implementation of
development programs.
</P>
<P>
"Hence we will hold courses and seminars for three key
officials -- executive secretary, youth development director and
national coach," he said.

<HEADLINE> HK to Seek Public Views on LegCo Electoral Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Electoral Affairs
Commission of Hong Kong has proposed a set of guidelines that lay
down rules for electoral arrangements and activities in respect of
the Legislative Council general election in September and the
Election Committee subsector election in July.
</P>
<P>
"Broad principles embodied in the guidelines have been widely
accepted by the public and various electoral arrangements have
been working well over the years," said Justice Woo Kwok-hing,
chairman of the Electoral Affairs Commission, at a press
conference to launch a public consultation exercise on the
proposals.
</P>
<P>
"We have learned from the recent District Councils election,
and we are focusing our attention on fine-tuning practical details
with a view to plugging possible loopholes and making improvements.
We attempt to improve on our rules so that they can be enforced
more effectively," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the guidelines had incorporated many suggestions
from the public and political groups since the first set of
guidelines was issued in July 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Electoral Affairs Commission will listen to public views at
a public forum to be held on February 23. The proposed guidelines
are available at all District Offices, the Registration and
Electoral Office and the website.
</P>
<P>
After the consultation exercise ends, the commission will draw
up a regulation governing matters including election
advertisements, voting and counting arrangements, and put it to
the Legislative Council for negative vetting.
</P>
<P>
It plans to issue the final guidelines in mid-May before
nominations open for the subsector election at the end of May.

Therefore, the Vatican found an excuse not to recognize those

<TEXT>
<P>
Under the protection of the Constitution, the Chinese citizens
are able to exercise freedom of religious belief to the full. In
China, religious or non-religious people or people with different
religious beliefs show respects to one another and live in harmony.
</P>
<P>
All the religions have equal footing and coexist peacefully,
and have never been engaged in religious disputes.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, there have never happened the so-called "religious
persecution" or "violation of freedom of religious belief".
</P>
<P>
As to China's "interference in the ordination of the Catholic
Archbishop" alleged by the resolution, it is sheer nonsense.
</P>
<P>
On January 6 this year, which marked the Catholic Epiphany, the
Chinese Catholic Bishop Corps held a ceremony to ordain five
bishops. This was a normal religious activity of the Chinese
Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the Roman Pope also ordained 12 bishops. Hence
the rumors that the Chinese Catholicism put on a rival show with
the Vatican came up. The EP, therefore, used the case and
described it as an "interference" in the ordination of the
Catholic Archbishop. This is absolutely absurd.

believe in, or not to believe in any religion; nor may they
discriminate against citizens who believe in, or do not believe in,
any religion.

<P>
The believers could, in accordance with the respective
religious doctrines and custom, conduct all kinds of regular
religious activities in temples, mosques, churches and private
homes, and the state protects normal religious activities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, The Constitution also stipulates that no one may
make use of religion to engage in activities that disrupt public
order and impair the health of citizens both physically and
psychologically.

The EP's resolution also blames China for "controlling" the so-
called "underground religious organizations." This does not tally
with the facts.
</P>
<P>
In China, there are no "underground religious organizations" at
all. This is something fabricated by some western people. The
Chinese Christianity and Catholicism have their own religious
groups, with the Chinese Christianity having 12,000-odd churches
and over 25,000 meeting places, and the Catholicism having
altogether more than 4,600 churches and ritual venues.
</P>
<P>
As many other countries in the world, the Chinese religious
groups and their religious venues should go through the
registration formalities according to law, and their
establishments and activities are protected by law.
</P>
<P>
The individual religion followers do not need to get registered.
To some venues which lack the conditions of registration, the
government adopts the method of temporary registration, and
implements the formal registration after the conditions are
completed.
</P>
<P>
This is totally to ensure that the religions can conduct their
normal and lawful activities. How can it be described as "
controlling"? In China, there are no so-called "open churches" and
"underground churches", or "official churches" and "unofficial
churches" at all.

The EP's resolution also lists the explanation by the Standing
Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC) of the
relative clause in the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR, accusing
the Central government for failing to "abide by" the concerning
commitments it has made to Hong Kong. This is utmost distortion.
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 29, 1999, when the Hong Kong Final Judgment Court
handled the case of the right of abode in HK, it denied the
relative article in the Regulations on the Entrance into the HKSAR
enacted by the SAR's Provisional Legislative Commission, which
provides that the Hong Kong permanent residents' children who are
born in the mainland can gain the right of abode in HK only when
one or both of their parents are HK permanent residents at the
time when they are born.
</P>
<P>
The court deemed that the Basic Law of the HKSAR regulates that
the children of the Hong Kong residents, irrespective of whether
one or both of the parents are permanent Hong Kong residents
before or after they are born, can have the right of abode in HK.
According to this verdict, as many as 1.67 million people who now
live in the mainland would gain their right to reside in HK.
</P>
<P>
As the SAR's land and social resources are too limited to meet
the demand of housing, education, medicare and social welfare and
so on raised by the flux of the new comers, the chief executive
officer of the HKSAR government, appealed, as authorized by the
Basic Law, through the Central People's Government to the NPC
Standing Committee to make an explanation of the relevant clause
in the Basic Law. In accordance with the Constitution and the
Basic Law, the Standing Committee of the NPC is authorized to make
explanations of any clause in the Basic Law.

The central government and the various provinces have helped
Tibet build more than 100 infrastructure projects, thus pushing
Tibet onto the track of rapid economic development.
</P>
<P>
Its GDP has enjoyed two-digit growth rate for many years on end,
higher than the country's average, substantially raising the
living standard of the people there.
</P>
<P>
In the 200 years before the 1950s, the population of Tibet had
been hovering at the level of around one million. Now the figure
has risen to 2.44 million, of which 95 percent are ethnic Tibetans.
The average life expectancy of the Tibetan people has increased
from 36 years in 1959 to the present 65 years.
</P>
<P>
Great progress has also made in Tibet's culture, education and
public health. Tibetans enjoy the full freedom of religious belief
and regular religious activities.
</P>
<P>
Every year, Lhasa is paid tribute by pious pilgrims of more
than one million persons/time. The old Tibet, which was ruled by
the Dalai Lama, could be a place where human rights were trampled
down most seriously in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai regime practiced the feudal serf system, which was
even darker than that of the European countries in the Middle Ages.
Under such system, 95 percent of the Tibetans were reduced to
serfs and slaves and had no human rights at all.

<P>
Today's Tibet can be rated among those places where human
rights situation has shown fastest and best improvement. As to the
Karmapa Buddha, who succeeded, with the approval by the State
Bureau of Religious Affairs, as the 17th Karmapa through the
Tibetan Buddhist rite, he left Tibet, leaving behind a letter to
the temple where he lived.
</P>
<P>
The letter says: "I left to get the Black Hats and the musical
instruments belonged to the Karmapa ancestors. I will not betray
the State and nation". This is absolutely personal deed. How can
it be interpreted as "the signal of oppression"?

<HEADLINE> Chinese NPC Refutes EP Resolution (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The resolution also accused China of "not making any progress"
in ratifying the two international covenants on human rights. This
is both unfair and untrue.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has been actively involved in the
endeavor by the UN system to promote and protect human rights, and
has shown its earnest attitude to the accession to the
international human rights conventions. So far, the Chinese
government has successively ratified and acceded to 17 human
rights conventions, two more than the United States has.
</P>
<P>
In October 1997 and October 1998 respectively, the Chinese
government signed the International Covenant on Economic, Social
and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights. Now they are being deliberated under the normal
process for which we see no blame should have been incurred. The
United States had spent 15 years before ratifying the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and has not
yet ratified, up to now, the International Covenant on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights after 23 years of deliberation.
</P>
<P>
Some European countries also took a long time in ratifying the
above-mentioned two covenants. For example, Britain spent 8 years,
Italy 11 years, Belgium 15 years, and Germany and Austria 5 years
each. Why didn't you raise any objections to those deliberation
procedures, but flagrantly criticized China's normal deliberating
process? This has fully exposed the hegemonic move of some EP
members.

<HEADLINE> Chinese NPC Refutes EP Resolution (6) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some members in the EP blamed China for its decision to outlaw
the "Falun Gong" cult. It is also totally unreasonable. Like the "
Aum Doomsday" cult in Japan, the "Davidian Branch" and "People's
Temple" in the United States, the "Scietology" in France, the "Son
of Satan" in Italy and the "Temple of the Sun" in Europe, etc.,
the "Falun Gong" cult and its leader Li Hongzhi indulged in
unbridled propaganda that "the Earth is going to explode soon" and
that "the Doomsday is coming near".
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi falsely called himself the sole "savior" and said
that his superman strength was dozens of times higher than those
of Jesus and Sakyamuni. He cheated the "Falun Gong" practitioners
that he had countless magic bodies to protect them, and he said he
would install a "Wheel of the Law" in each of the ractitioner's
bellies.
</P>
<P>
He boasted that people could "be rescued" only by practicing
his "Falun Gong" and that they must absolutely obey his orders. He
controlled them in spirit and amassed millions of wealth only for
him to squander. Li also declared that those who practice "Falun
Gong" shouldn't take medicines in spite of having diseases. His
heretical ideas have fooled many kind people and led to serious
social subsequences.
</P>
<P>
According to incomplete statistics, so far 1,404 people around
the country have died because of practicing "Falun Gong", and
innumerable people have been disabled and distraught by the cult.
Some practitioners even murdered their own parents, wives and
children by cruel means, believing it could help the killed "rise
to the Heaven".
</P>
<P>
In face of such a cult organization which destabilizes the
society and harms the people, any responsible government cannot
bear to sit idle and let the cult go unchecked.

<P>
The Chinese government adopted timely and resolute measures to
outlaw the cult in accordance with the law, and put to justice the
few incorrigibly obstinate organizers and plotters, thus
liberating the majority of practitioners and preventing them from
being further harmed.
</P>
<P>
By outlawing the "Falun Gong" cult, the Chinese government aims
to safeguard social stability and protect the rights and interests
of the majority of the Chinese people. The action has the strong
support of the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
The measures taken by the Chinese government has no fundamental
differences from the actions adopted by the Japanese, American,
British, French and Italian governments in handling cult cases.
</P>
<P>
Why a cult organization can be punished according to law in
other countries, while in China, it should have been crowned as
religion and protected by the outside forces? Now you have so
leniently sided with the "Falun Gong" cult, which has claimed
thousands of lives, do you call it the rightful action of
maintaining the human rights?
</P>
<P>
The EP has made such a decision. If not out of ignorance of the
facts, then it must have been out of deliberately applying double
standards to China. Could there be any other explanations than
that?

Under such circumstances, the Standing Committee of the NPC
explained the relative clause in the Basic Law, making it clear by
defining that the original legislative meaning of the HK permanent
residents "who have borne their children of Chinese nationality in
areas outside HK" refers to those people who "at the time when
they are born", one or both of their parents must have the
identification of permanent HK residents. The purpose to make such
a rule is to effectively keep under control the overgrowth of the
HK population and safeguard the long-term stability of the HK
society.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the verdict on the issue of the right of abode in HK
made by the HK Final Judgment Court is not HK internal affairs but
something pertaining to the relationship between the mainland and
HK.
</P>
<P>
The explanation made by the Standing Committee of the NPC does
not replace the deliberations and verdicts conducted on the
concrete cases by the HK Final Judgment Court, and will not affect
the independent powers of judiciary and final adjudication enjoyed
by the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
It has won the support of the broad HK citizens. It is
irrational for the EP members to lash criticism on China before
obtaining the truth of the facts.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Announces Guidelines for Communications Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Monday announced
two guidelines on substantial lessening of competition and
dominant position in a communications market.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines aiming at establishing a framework and clear
powers for the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission
(CMC) to act against anti-competitive practices in the
communications industry will come into effect Tuesday, CMC
Chairman Syed Hussein Mohamed told a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
He said the Communications and Multimedia Act (CMA) 1998 adopts
a pro-competition stance and is aimed at developing a healthy
communications and multimedia industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the CMC had been given express authority under he CMA
to address anti-competitive behavior in the communications market.
</P>
<P>
He said the CMC established on November 1, 1998, is charged
with regulating the industries for broadcasting,
telecommunications and on-line services in accordance with the
national policy objectives set out in the CMA 1998.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of these guidelines is to clarify the meaning
of dominant position and the type of activity that could amount to
substantial lessening of competition, Syed Hussein said.
</P>
<P>
These guidelines would also assist in ascertaining dominant
players and the types of activity which were prohibited, he said.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hussein said the legal provisions on general competition
present in the CMA were new.
</P>
<P>
He clarified that in the absence of general competition policy
in Malaysia, these provisions were necessary as they clarified how
the CMC would approach its assessment of anti-competitive behavior
in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
Under the substantial lessening of competition guidelines, he
said the types of conduct that were prohibited included predatory
pricing, foreclosure, refusal to supply goods or services,
bundling and parallel pricing.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines provide penalty on misconduct, that is a fine
not exceeding 500,000 ringgit (about 131,578 U.S. dollars) or an
imprisonment not exceeding five years or both, and a further fine
of 1,000 ringgit (about 263 dollars) for every day or part of a
day during which the offense continues after conviction, according
to the official.
</P>
<P>
He said non-compliance with the CMC's directions is an offense
under the CMA, the penalty for which is a fine not exceeding 300,
000 ringgit (about 78,947 dollars) or a jail term not exceeding
three years or both.
</P>
<P>
Energy, Communications and Multimedia Minister Leo Moggie, who
was present at the press conference, said the guidelines were
formulated to allow a more orderly competition among companies
without putting a block from thinking innovative.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Kenya Airways has put in place
a series of accident response measures following the crash of its
Airbus A301 into the sea off Abidjan Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan plane, KQ431 flight, carrying 168 passengers and 11
crew, crashed into the sea shortly after take-off from Abidjan,
Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan airline technical director Steve Clark told the
press conference here Monday morning that an accident response
center has been formed at the headquarters of the airline, which
started operation at 00: 30 (local time).
</P>
<P>
In addition, a passenger information center, a friends and
relatives information and a press information center have been
set up in the capital Nairobi, Clark said.
</P>
<P>
Information centers are also to be set up in Abidjan and Lagos,
Clark said, adding that all the centers would remain open as long
as neccessary.
</P>
<P>
Clark also noted the airline has sought assistance from the
partner KLM, a Dutch airline which owns 26 percent stake of Kenya
Airways, and British Airways in the handling of the accident.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has dispatched a team of 29 officials and
 investigators to Abidjan to work closely with the governments of
Nigeria and Cote d'Ivoire for expediting investigations for
detailed reports.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Airways, a small airline with a previously sound safety
record, has 10 aircraft including Airbus A310 serving 25
destinations across Africa,
</P>
<P>
and the Middle East, India and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Kenyan airline announced a 750-million-U.S.
dollar expansion program in the next five years, designed to
replace its four Airbus A310 with new Boeing 767-300s.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Awaits Court Ruling, Chilean Plane Stands By </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- British High Court is due to
give a decision Monday on whether former Chilean leader Augusto
Pinochet could be allowed to return home while a plane from Chile
is waiting near London to take the general back.
</P>
<P>
Belgium and six human rights groups are mounting a legal
challenge to the proposal to free the general from house arrest in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
They are arguing that British Home Secretary Jack Straw's
decision not to release the medical report on Pinochet's health is
unfair and unlawful.
</P>
<P>
If the court's decision goes against them, Pinochet could be
flying home within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Straw said in mid-January that he is "minded" to release
Pinochet after a panel of medical experts decided he was unfit to
stand trial.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 84, has been fighting extradition to Spain since he
was arrested more than a year ago after coming to London for
medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
A Spanish judge made the extradition request to Britain,
alleging Pinochet had committed crimes against humanity while in
charge of Chile's military government from 1973 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
Belgium entered the dispute after Straw said he was "minded" to
release Pinochet. It was alleged that Pinochet was behind the
jailing and killing of Chileans whose relatives now live in
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
A Chilean air force jet is on standby at an air base northwest
of London to whisk Pinochet home as soon as he is allowed to leave
the country.

<HEADLINE> HK to Enforce New Law Against Money Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is going to enforce
the Organized and Serious Crimes (Amendment) Bill 1999 to enhance
Hong Kong's anti-money laundering regime, according to a
government press release Monday.
</P>
<P>
The new legislation that was passed by the Legislative Council
on January 19 this year requires all persons carrying on money
changing or remittance businesses, except for a number of
financial institutions currently under the supervision of their
respective regulators and the relevant legislation, to identify
customers before engaging in transactions over 20,000 HK dollars (
2,564 U.S. dollars) and to keep proper records of such
transactions for at least six years.
</P>
<P>
If money changers and remittance agents do not adhere to these
requirements, they will be liable to a maximum fine of 100,000 HK
dollars (12,800 U.S. dollars) and imprisonment for three months.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the passage of the Amendment Bill Monday, a spokesman
for the Narcotics Division of the Hong Kong government said, "The
new requirements will be simple and easy to enforce and yet
effective in fighting money laundering. They will not be too
onerous or costly for the affected businesses to comply with."
</P>
<P>
Money changers and remittance agents have been identified as an
important link in the money laundering chain by the Financial
Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF), a pre-eminent inter-
governmental organization established by the G-7 Summit in 1989 to
combat money laundering.
</P>
<P>
"The Amendment Ordinance will bring Hong Kong's anti-money
laundering regime fully in compliance with FATF's recommendations
and in line with the best international practices," the spokesman
said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese NPC Refutes EP Resolution (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full text of
the statement issued here today by the Foreign Affairs Committee
of China's National People's Congress (NPC) on the EP resolution
on China's human rights situation:
</P>
<P>
On January 20, the European Parliament (EP) adopted a
resolution on China's human rights situation. The resolution, in
disregard of facts, criticized China that its human rights
situation is "worsening continuously". It openly invited pressure
on China, and even called for an anti-China resolution with the U.
S. at the coming 56th Assembly of the U.N. Commission on Human
Rights.
</P>
<P>
In view of the EP's perverse move to insist on antagonizing
China in disregard of the overall situation of the Sino-EU
relationship, we hereby express our strong dissatisfaction and
resolute opposition.
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that China is a country where people play
the role of the master. The Chinese government commits itself to
doing everything for the interests of the people and protecting
and promoting people's human rights, and has already made great
achievements that have attracted worldwide attention.
</P>
<P>
As a developing country with the largest population in the
world, China has managed to feed its 1.2 billion people, 22
percent of the world population, with only 7 percent of the world
cultivated land through its own efforts within a short span of
several decades.

<HEADLINE> Chinese NPC Refutes EP Resolution (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the past twenty years of economic reform and opening up to
the outside world, when the world impoverished population has been
on the rise by 25 million annually, China has done its best to
have its impoverished people reduced from 250 million in 1979 to
30 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
This has made China a country where impoverished population
decreases the fastest in the world. All of these have added up to
manifest China's great accomplishments in its human rights
endeavor, which has not only guaranteed the Chinese people their
foremost right to subsistence, but made tremendous contributions
to the cause of the world human rights as well.
</P>
<P>
China attaches importance to the protection and promotion of
the people's rights to subsistence and development, in the
meantime, it also attaches importance to safeguarding and
advancing their civil, political and individual rights.
</P>
<P>
In governing the country, China emphasized the rule of law.
This is not only clearly defined in the Constitution to provide
broad citizen and political rights as well as economic, social and
cultural rights, but a series of laws and regulations have also
been formulated in a bid to safeguard the people's rights to
administering the State affairs as well as economic, cultural and
social affairs through various ways and means.
</P>
<P>
Together with the broad rights to democracy and freedom which
include notably, freedom of speech, press, assembly, association,
procession and demonstration, freedom of religious belief and the
right to supervise the State organs and functionaries, etc. have
also been provided and safeguarded.
</P>
<P>
In short, the human rights enjoyed by the Chinese people at
present and China's legal protection on the human rights are so
unprecedented that, without exaggeration, China ranks among those
countries whose human rights situation can be counted as the best
in the world.
</P>
<P>
In terms of human rights situation, China is by no means
inferior to the western countries and in certain aspects even more
practical than what they practice. The Chinese people are
satisfied with the situation. Now, some members in the EP still
cling to their ideological bias toward China and do not bother to
find out the reality in China. Turning a blind eye to China's
great efforts to protect and promote the cause of human rights and
the historic progress it has made in this aspect, they stubbornly
accused China for the "continuously worsening" human rights
situation. Isn't it quite unreasonable?

<HEADLINE> Chinese NPC Refutes EP Resolution (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The resolution says that the Chinese ethnic groups, especially
the Tibetans, Mongolians and the Uygurs, have been "harassed".
This is a sheer fabrication. China is a unified multi-national
country with 56 nationalities.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of new China in October 1949, the government
abolished the discriminating and oppressing system employed by the
old China against the ethnic groups and realized the policy of
equality, unity, mutual assistance and common prosperity among all
the nationalities.
</P>
<P>
Although in recent years, ethnic contradictions in many places
of the world are quite protruding and even lead to military
conflicts, China has all along maintained the unity of all
nationalities and thus the stability of the country. This has
demonstrated that China's ethnic policy is correct.
</P>
<P>
In order to faithfully realize equality among all nationalities,
the Chinese government has appropriated large amounts of money and
adopted a variety of methods to help the ethnic minority areas
speed up their economic and cultural development, making their
economic growth rate higher than the country's average for many
consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the people's income in those areas has more than
doubled in the past five years, the ethnic culture thrived and the
ethnic medicare rapidly developed. The ethnic population has
increased from 34 million in 1953 to near 100 million at present,
accounting for 8.9 percent of the country's total population,
compared to original 5.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The freedom of religious belief of all nationalities has been
guaranteed in earnest.
</P>
<P>
According to the provisions in the Constitution and laws, China
has, under the unified State leadership, instituted a system of
regional autonomy and established autonomous organs in all ethnic
areas.
</P>
<P>
Being masters of their own, the ethnic minorities exercise the
autonomous right of administering their own affairs, ensuring the
rapid development and progress in all ethnic areas.
</P>
<P>
Take Tibet for an example. Since the establishment of the
autonomous region in 1959, great changes have taken place there.
The central government has provided Tibet an input of one billion
Yuan and 200,000 tons of goods supply annually, applied such
preferential policy to the Tibetan herdsmen that all their income
belongs to themselves and the taxes and unified purchase are
eliminated.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Leader Meets Islamic Delegates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), met here today with delegates to the Seventh
National Congress of Chinese Islam.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting , Li, also member of the Standing Committee
of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC)
Central Committee, was briefed on the congress by Chen Guangyuan,
new president of the Islamic Association of China.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, the association has played an
important role in helping the party and government implement the
country's policies of religious freedom, Li said.
</P>
<P>
It has also done a lot in serving the Muslim masses, promoting
the reform and opening up, enhancing ethnic unity, and maintaining
social stability and national integrity, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that the new leadership of the association
will continue to carry on the good traditions of the group, adapt
to the new situation and make more contributions to the country.
</P>
<P>
A lot of Muslims live in the country's middle and western
regions. Muslim associations at all levels should seize the
historic opportunity of the country's western development and do
more for local economies and people's lives, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The congress, which concluded here on Sunday, called on the
association to give full play to its own advantages and actively
participate in the great cause of western development.
</P>
<P>
It should do more to promote and lead the Muslim religion to
fit into the socialist society, consolidate ethnic unity,
resolutely oppose all ethnic separatist and extremist forces, and
contribute to the maintenance of social stability and national
integrity.
</P>
<P>
The congress also asked the country's Muslims to uphold the
great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, rally around the CPC Central
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core and do its utmost
to the eventual revitalization of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few days, the congress approved the work report
of the previous leadership and revised the association charter.

<HEADLINE> Forum Held to Remember President's Statement on Reunification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- A forum was held here today by
three leading non-governmental organizations in China to mark the
fifth anniversary of President Jiang Zemin's important speech on
the reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The three sponsors were the All-China Federation of Trade
Unions, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth
League, and the All-China Women's Federation.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, heads of the organizations hailed Jiang's
speech as an accurate expression of the theory of "peaceful
reunification" and "one country, two systems" developed by late
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's Eight-point Proposition on the reunification of the
motherland is a show of determination and sincerity of the
Communist Party of China and the central government and is in line
with the wishes of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, trade unions from the two sides of
the Taiwan Straits have made breakthroughs in developing their
relations, according to Zhang Junjiu, a vice chairman of the All-
China Federation of Trade Unions.
</P>
<P>
Zhang challenged Lee Teng-hui's "two-state" remark, claiming
that Lee's statement has damaged the basis for developing the
cross-straits ties and harmed the interests of the people of
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In their speeches, leading officials of the Chinese Communist
Youth League and the All-China Women's Federation said that they
will continue to increase exchanges between the two sides and play
their due role in realizing the reunification and battling against
the separatists in Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Donates 3.2 Million Pencils for Iraqi School Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 31 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of the Jordanian
National Mobilization Committee in Defense of Iraq arrived here
Sunday evening carrying 3.2 million pencils for Iraqi school
children, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Head of the delegation and chairman of the committee, Jordanian
legislator Hamza Mansour told the INA that the Jordanian people
believe that "the battle of Iraq is just in confronting the
American tyranny."
</P>
<P>
Deputy chairman of the committee Salim al-Nahas described the "
One Million Pencil" campaign as "outcry in the face of those who
impose unjust embargo."
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian committee launched the campaign last December
because pencils are one of the items whose entry into Iraq is
banned for its dual usage under the United Nations sanctions
imposed on Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The committee announced earlier this month in the Jordanian
capital of Amman that "this campaign is the largest popular
activity in Jordan to publicly break the sanctions imposed on Iraq
for the past 10 years."
</P>
<P>
"There are American pressure on the (Jordanian) government to
prevent us from sending the pencils to the Iraqi school children,"
said a delegation member.
</P>
<P>
The committee, representing political parties and labor unions,
invited contributors to the campaign to escort the pencils to the
border with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
According to the committee, leading international opponents of
sanctions such as British parliamentarian George Galloway and
former Unites States Attorney General Ramsey Clark contributed 10,
000 and 15,000 pencils respectively to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Galloway is leading a campaign to get the U.N. sanctions on Iraq
lifted and Clark last week accompanied a multi-national delegation
of humanitarian organizations to Baghdad to deliver 2 million U.S.
dollars worth of aid items.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Palestinians from the West Bank town of
Ramallah had launched their "pencils for Iraqi school children"
campaign.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reclaims Sovereignty over Disputed Gulf Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Monday reclaimed its full
sovereignty over three disputed islands in the Gulf in response to
a renewed call of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for a peaceful
settlement to Tehran's "occupation" of the islands.
</P>
<P>
"As it has been emphatically reiterated, the three islands are
inseparable part of the Iranian territory," Iranian Foreign
Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi was quoted by the state-run
television as saying.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Iran is ready to hold direct and
unconditional talks with the UAE to "remove the prevailing
misunderstanding" between the two countries over the islands.
</P>
<P>
Iran took over the islands of Abu Musa, the Greater and Lesser
Tunbs at the mouth of the strategic Hormoz Strait in 1971 after
British colonist forces withdrew from the region, days before the
UAE's establishment.
</P>
<P>
Both Iran and the UAE have claimed full sovereignty over the
islands. Aub Dhabi has called for an international arbitration to
solve the dispute, but Tehran has insisted on bilateral talks based
on their 1971 agreement to "remove misunderstanding."

officers, duty officers, assistant duty officers, commanding post
officers and guard duty officers on the same footing with their
male counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The duty officer is in charge of managing personnel, enforcing
safety, establishing discipline and other essential unit tasks in
the barracks during off-duty hours in lieu of a commanding officer.
</P>
<P>
The revision of Article 67 of the Army Regulation was a result
of the persistent recommendation by women officers and soldiers
who maintain their exclusion from the duty officers system
unfairly discriminated them, said an army official.
</P>
<P>
South Korean women are now assigned to all but cavalry,
artillery, chaplain corps and air defense artillery.

<HEADLINE> Oil Company Reports High Earnings in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- China National Star Petroleum
Corporation (CNSPC) reported that its 1999 taxes and profits hit
476 million yuan (about 57.3 million US dollars), up 47.8 percent
from the 1998 figure.
</P>
<P>
The company's turnover grew by 18 percent to 6.2 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
CNSPC President Zhu Jiazhen said the company's newly-added oil
and gas reserves hit 164 million tons during the year, or 134.18
percent more than the State target. The company's just-added
proven reserves reached 93.21 million tons.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, CNSPC owned a cumulative proven reserve
total of 330 million tons, doubling the 1996 figure, when the
company was set up, combining the marine geology branches of the
former Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources.
</P>
<P>
The company's biggest exploration breakthrough in 1999 was its
strike of the first commercial oil flow in Lunpola basin in the
northern part of the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
According to CNSPC, the successful trial oil recovery marked an
end to Tibet's history of no crude oil production. An oilfield
with a geological oil reserve of more than 10 million tons is
expected to be built.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the company's exploration efforts have also
yielded encouraging results in northern Tarim basin, Sichuan basin
and the southern part of Songliao basin.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the company continued to use state-of-the-art
technology to fight against the natural decline in crude
production in 1999. For the whole year, the company produced 2.96
million tons equivalent of crude oil and gas, up 58 percent over
1998.

year term which cannot be renewed.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli police Sunday night launched investigation into
massive funding violations in last year's elections, with five
teams of investigators poring over reams of materials related to
breach of the Campaign Finance Law by One Israel, the Likud, Center
party, United Torah Judaism, and Yisrael Beiteinu.
</P>
<P>
Top police officials, Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein and
State Attorney Edna Arbel met with State Comptroller Eliezer
Goldberg and received the information that led to Goldberg's
scathing report on funding violations.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Goldberg Sunday told a closed meeting in his office that he
is furious at the fact that his report on party financing in the
1999 elections has become the subject of a political controversy
between the parties in the Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
The comptroller's report, issued last Thursday, was particularly
scathing with regard to the nonprofit associations utilized by
Prime Minister Ehud Barak's One Israel coalition to channel funds,
illegally in the comptroller's view, to pay for election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Barak vowed Sunday that Israel would punish those responsible
for killing one of the South Lebanese Army's (SLA) most senior
officers, while efforts continued to restrain the SLA from the kind
of retaliation that could lead to a major escalation in the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
Akl Hachem, commander of the SLA's western brigade and NO.2 in
the Israeli-backed army, was killed Sunday in a carefully planned
and executed bomb attack at one of his farmhouse in his home
village.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli and Palestinian negotiation teams met Sunday at a
secret location north of Jerusalem in what the Palestinians
described as the start of "marathon negotiations in which Israel's
seriousness will be put to the test".
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Barak met alone with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak in Cairo for nearly 90 minutes and United States Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright held talks with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat at Davos, Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Oil Experts Complete Assessment in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 31 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. oil expert team left here
on Monday morning after concluding two weeks of comprehensive
survey of the condition of the Iraqi oil production sector and of
its needs for spare parts and equipment.
</P>
<P>
The team, which comprised experts from Britain, Jordan, the
Netherlands and Russia, was set up by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan to report on alternatives for increasing Iraq's oil
production and export capacity, and on options for involving
foreign oil companies in Iraq's oil sector.
</P>
<P>
These U.N. oil exports inspected, during their stay, Iraq's oil
installations and held talks with Iraqi officials.
</P>
<P>
They also assessed the impact of holds placed by the U.N.
Sanctions Committee on contracts for spare parts and equipment for
the Iraqi oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. Security Council's resolution on Iraq adopted
last December, these oil experts will have to report by March 26 to
the Security Council on Iraq's existing oil production and export
capacity and to make recommendations in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council said in the resolution that it is ready to
authorize additions to the current allocation for oil spare parts
and equipment on the basis of the report and recommendations of
this oil expert team.
</P>
<P>
Since the fourth phase of the oil-for-food program which started
in May 1998, Iraq has been allowed by the Security Council to spend
300 million U.S. dollars from its oil revenues on oil spare parts
and equipment in each phase.
</P>
<P>
However, Baghdad has argued that the sum is far from enough to
rehabilitate its dilapidated oil industry and asked for raising
allocations for this purpose.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Reiterates Call for National Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada reiterated Monday his call for national unity as he said
the economy is showing strong signs of sustaining its recovery
form the Asian financial crisis, the presidential palace said.
</P>
<P>
A press statement released by the presidential palace quoted
Estrada as saying that the 3.6 percent economic growth for 1999
surpassed government's own expectations, paving the way for a
brighter economic future for Filipinos this year.
</P>
<P>
"We are on the way up because the 3.2 percent Gross Domestic
product and 3.6 percent Gross National Product is more than what
we expected for the year 1999," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out, however, that the only thing
standing in the way of this sustained economic recovery is
divisiveness among the Filipino people.
</P>
<P>
Such divisiveness, he said, threatens to block the gains made
so far under his one-and-a-half year old administration.
</P>
<P>
"That is why my theme was to call for national unity," he said,
referring to his prayer at the National Prayer Breakfast meeting
last week.
</P>
<P>
Estrada joined religious leaders on January 26 in calling for "
national unity" and putting an end to political differences.
</P>
<P>
"It reminds us of the extent to which we have been divided by
self-serving interests and conflicting opinions about the issues
of life and death around us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Certain policies of the Estrada administration have been
criticized by various sectors including former president Fidel
Ramos, the Catholic Church and militant groups.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey conducted by the Social Weather
Station, Estrada's net approval rating declined drastically from
28 percent in October 1999 to the all-time low record of positive
five percent in December of the same year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Continues to Play Supportive Role in Solving Great Lakes Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
continue to play a supportive role in solving conflicts in the
Great Lakes region, the Guardian newspaper quoted U.S. Ambassador
to Tanzania Charles Stith as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
During a three-day visit to Tanzania's southwestern Mbeya
Region on Sunday, the US envoy said that although his country was
concerned with what was happening in the region, it would be wrong
to interfere in African affairs.
</P>
<P>
"It is upon the African leadership to play a key role because
their people depend on good governance," Stith said.
</P>
<P>
He paid tribute to Tanzanians for their hospitality in
accommodating refugees and countries in ensuring that the problems
facing Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda
were settled amicably.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the new facilitator for Burundi peace talks Nelson
Mandela said US President Bill Clinton had agreed to participate
in the effort to bring peace to Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Mandela has invited leaders from the Middle East, Europe, U.S.
and Africa to join the next round of talks involving Burundi's
warring factions, to be held in northern Tanzanian town of Arusha
in the middle of February.
</P>
<P>
According to the former South African President, Clinton had
said he would participate through a video link-up via satellite if
he could not attend in person.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between Hutu rebels and the Tutsi-dominated army has
killed more than 200,000 Burundians since the conflict started six
years ago and has driven at least 300,000 more people into
UN-operated refugee camps in neighboring Tanzania.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices in Tokyo rose for
the fourth straight trading day Monday, with the key Nikkei index
hitting an almost 30-month closing high.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 104.92 points, or 0.54
percent, from last Friday's close to end at 19,539.70, the highest
close since August 8, 1997 when it finished at 19,604.46.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, added 5.35 points or 0.31 percent to 1,707.
96.

</P>
<P>
Nissan Motor was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
After opening lower following last Friday's plunge on Wall
Street, the Nikkei index gradually turned upward as the
establishment of new investment trusts this week led investors to
buy stocks.
</P>
<P>
The yen's weakness against the U.S. dollar also made investors
feel good about buying stocks, particularly those of exporters,
traders said.
</P>
<P>
Automakers were higher, helped by the weak yen.
</P>
<P>
Gainers also included non-banking moneylenders, real estate
firms and textile companies, while steelmakers, banks and
brokerage houses faced selling.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Appoints New Officials to Restructured Departments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Jin Shengguan, who has devoted
himself to reforming the leadership of Beijing's state-owned
enterprises (SOE), has been named the new director of Beijing
Municipal Economic Committee (BMEC).
</P>
<P>
The BMEC resulted from a restructuring of the CPC Beijing
industrial working committee, which occurred as part of a reform
mapped out at the request of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Jin and another eight appointees have been approved by the
Standing Committee of the Municipal People's Congress since the
official re-grouping of senior committees.
</P>
<P>
According to the reform plan, some departments under the
Beijing Municipal Party Committee were merged into functionally
similar departments under the Beijing Municipal People's
Government.
</P>
<P>
This has helped the Municipal Party Committee cut its
departments from 17 to 12, and will result in the reduction of 20
percent of employees.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal People's Government has reorganized its
67 offices and departments into 45. Those with overlapping
responsibilities were melded with others or just eliminated, such
as the bureau of geology and mineral resources, the bureau of
housing and land management, the bureau of taxi administration,
and the urban and rural planning committee.

KUNMING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Flights at the Kunming
International Airport resumed at noon today after being suspended
for more than 28 hours due to an expected heavy snow in Kunming,
capital of southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
The snow, the first and heaviest since 1983, started to fall on

at the airport.
</P>
<P>
According to airport officials, the airport is expected to
handle 113 departures and 123 arrivals today. But some scheduled

<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Foreign Affairs Committee
of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC) today issued a
statement to refute a recent resolution adopted by the European
Parliament (EP) concerning China's human rights situation.
</P>
<P>
The EP adopted the resolution on January 20, which, in
disregard of facts, criticized that China's human rights situation
is "worsening continuously". It openly invited pressure on China,
and even called for an anti-China resolution with the U.S. at the
coming 56th Assembly of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the EP's perverse move to insist on antagonizing
China in disregard of the overall situation of the Sino-EU (
European Union) relationship, we hereby to express our strong
dissatisfaction and resolute opposition," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> China's Challenge System Covers Ex-Judges, Relatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- To ensure justice and avoid
allegations of nepotism in the judiciary, China's Supreme Court
issued a set of regulations today, banning ex-judge-turned lawyers
from trying cases in their old courtrooms.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a relative of an incumbent judge who is currently
working as an attorney will also be removed from the court, the
regulations stipulated.
</P>
<P>
"Situations like this have appeared in recent years in many
parts of China," Liu Huisheng, spokesman for the Supreme People's
Court, said at a press conference here today. "It is probable that
the judges have had an unfair influence on court trials and have
prompted complaints from the opposing attorneys in litigation."
</P>
<P>
The regulations on the challenge system also made a few other
additions to the existing laws, including outlawing judges from
meeting litigants in private, providing attorneys for litigants,
accepting bribes, attending parties hosted by litigants, or
borrowing money from them.
</P>
<P>
Any judge found to have committed the above-mentioned
wrongdoing will be withdrawn from court and faces disciplinary
action and possibly criminal charges, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations, judges who don't enforce the
challenge system are also subject to disciplinary action, and
their cases will be dismissed and re-tried by other judges, so as
to be ordered by courts of the second instance.
</P>
<P>
In a widesweeping move to wipe out judicial corruption, the
Supreme Court has issued a series of regulations in recent years
to beef up its internal check and balance system.
</P>
<P>
Today's regulations constitute "another major step forward in
boosting the image of the Chinese courts and preventing the few
judges from abusing their power for the interests of their
relatives, friends or personal gains," said the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Scholar on Macao's Role in Cross-Straits Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 31 (Xinhua) -- With Macao returned to the
motherland, its unique role in the relationship across the Taiwan
Straits should be explored deeper, according to a Macao scholar.
</P>
<P>
At a recent seminar held in Macao, Wong Hon Keong, chairman of
the Macao Society of Social Sciences, said that the principle of "
one country, two systems" has been implemented successfully in
Hong Kong, and its successful implementation in Macao will be of
great significance for resolving the Taiwan question.
</P>
<P>
The principle will have a strong appeal to the people in Taiwan,
exert great pressure on the Taiwan authorities, and deal a heavy
blow to the separatist forces there, Wong said.
</P>
<P>
Due to historical reasons, Macao and Taiwan have maintained
close ties, he said. On the other hand, Macao people have a
tradition of patriotism and are ready to promote the complete
reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui's separatist remarks have seriously harmed the
cross-Straits relations, he said. "Under such circumstances, the
unique role of Macao should be better displayed," Wong Hon Keong
said.

<HEADLINE> Gulf States Consider Joining Port Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Some Gulf countries are
negotiating to sign the international Memorandum of Understanding
on Port State Control, which will enable them to carry out
inspections on ships calling at their ports.
</P>
<P>
Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Kuwait and
Bahrain had already proposed to join the port control treaty and
the countries have held a discussion in Bahrain recently on the
issue, David Gibons, executive director of Dubai Ports Authority,
was quoted by the Khaleej Times daily as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The official hoped that the initiative would prove successful
and would bring about the enforcement of port control in this
region.
</P>
<P>
"It is not possible to have any port control in any region
unless all coastal states agree to sign it," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is very important to sign the treaty because if Gulf states
fail to do so, substandard ships from all over the world would land
up in this region because they are not allowed to trade in other
regions, he noted, adding that currently there is a large number of
substandard ships operating in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf is one of the only two regions in the global maritime
industry that have not joined the treaty so far. The other is the
Black Sea region.
</P>
<P>
Under the treaty, all ships calling at ports of the member
states have to be registered with local authorities which have the
rights to carry out inspections on the ships and even refuse entry
if the ships do not meet required standards.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf states also include Qatar and Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Congress Urged to Support Estrada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Former Philippine president
Fidel Ramos has called on Congress to support President Joseph
Estrada by passing the reform bills proposed by the sitting
president to promote the country's economy, Philippine News Agency
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Ramos as saying in a news conference last
Friday in his hometown where he was inaugurating new projects,
that he was luckier when he was president because he got the
needed support from Congress.
</P>
<P>
He said when the East Asian financial turmoil hit the country,
most of the needed policies were already in place.
</P>
<P>
"That was why although we were hit (by the financial crisis),
we were perceived to be the least affected among our neighbors,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos recalled that President Estrada has proposed to Congress
the enactment of at least 10 reform bills in July 1998 in his
State-of-the-Nation address (SONA), starting with the 1999
national appropriations act.
</P>
<P>
Other bills include privatization of the National Power
Corporation, amendment of the Retail Trade Law, amendment of the
Philippine Central Bank Charter and amendment to the General
Banking Law.
</P>
<P>
He said that in his 1999 SONA, President Estrada again sought
these reform bills needed by the country to weather or confront
the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said even the national appropriations act of the year 2000
has not yet been passed until Monday although he admitted that
this also happened during his time.

<HEADLINE> hke013121-- Indonesia May Lose its Natural Forest in 15 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is facing a severe
depletion of forest resources and may lose its natural forest
areas within 15 years if no strong commitment is given by the
government and the private sector for sustainable forest
management, experts have said.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia's natural forest areas fell by a dramatic 48 million
hectares to 92.5 million hectares in 1999 from 140.4 million
hectares in 1970," the Jakarta Post daily quoted data issued by
the Indonesian Forestry Community for Reforms as saying.
</P>
<P>
Natural forest areas in Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Irian
Jaya had depleted rapidly in the last 13 years, with accumulative
average loss of 1.6 million hectares a year, head of the planning
office at the Ministry of Forestry and Plantations Moch. Toha was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said, the fast pace of the permanent disappearance of
natural forest areas was partly caused by the flawed policies of
the previous government.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1980s, the government increased the exploitation of
industrial forests in order to provide raw materials for the
country's rapidly growing pulp industry.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1988, no less than 600 forest concessions,
including those for industrial forests, operated on some 67
million hectares of forest areas, producing raw materials to
supply over 70 million cubic meters of timber for wood and pulp
industries.
</P>
<P>
Official data estimated that 60 percent of about 48 million
natural forest areas which disappeared in the last 30 years were
converted into commercial plantations, industrial sites,
agricultural expansion areas and new settlement of transmigration
sites.
</P>
<P>
Forestry management is likely to be on top of the agenda of the
meeting of the Consultatives Group on Indonesia (CGI) scheduled on
February 1-2. The meeting would be chaired by the World Bank (WB).
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has said that donor countries were seriously
worried about the way Indonesia managed its natural forest.
</P>
<P>
According to Moch. Toha, the government of Indonesia had
intended to uphold law enforcement and minimize the natural forest
conversion in a bid to curb the deforestation.

<HEADLINE> Permits Revoked for More Closed Overseas-Backed Ventures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Wuhan, capital of central China's
Hubei Province, revoked business permits of 320 shot down overseas-
backed ventures in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Information from the Wuhan City Administration for Industry and
Commerce said that the closed foreign-funded firms failed to
participate in annual reviews for five years straight, some were
sham operations posing as legitimate businesses, and some had
never even existed.
</P>
<P>
The shut-down companies affect industrial and commercial
management, payment of taxes, economic indexes and major decision-
making of local governments, said an official with the
administration, adding that closing them would help improve Wuhan'
s image as it opens further to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Despite a drop in the approved number of overseas-financed
projects last year, Wuhan, located on the mighty Yangtze River,
has made marked increases in the volume of contracted overseas
investment and in the volume of paid investment from overseas.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, overseas-financed enterprises in this central
Chinese city delivered 176 million U.S. dollars worth of
commodities for exports, and paid 1.53 billion yuan in taxes, both
showing double-digit growth from 1998.

<HEADLINE> HK Sets up Post Certification Authority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has established a
post certification authority as a public key infrastructure to
enhance the security of electronic communications over open
networks.
</P>
<P>
Security of electronic communication over open networks is a
major concern of those who use the Internet, said Secretary for
Information Technology and Broadcasting K C Kwong Monday at the
inauguration ceremony of the Hongkong Post Certification Authority.
</P>
<P>
It is also the primary reason why many people refrain from
purchasing goods or services over the Internet as they are
reluctant to give out personal or credit information in such an
open environment, Kwong said.
</P>
<P>
"To encourage the development of electronic commerce and to
enable it to take hold and flourish in Hong Kong, we must have a
safe and secure environment for the conduct of electronic
transactions," he said.
</P>
<P>
With the use of public key cryptography, digital signatures and
digital certificates issued by properly accredited certification
authorities, parties to an electronic transaction will be able to
authenticate the identity of each other, ensure the
confidentiality and integrity of the messages exchanged, and guard
against repudiation of the transaction made with those messages,
Kwong added.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Cuban President Fidel
Castro has extended his personal invitation for Malaysia Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad to attend the G-77 summit of developing
countries in Havana in April, Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The invitation, in recognition of Mahathir's role as a strong
advocate and supporter of South-South relations, was conveyed by a
special envoy of the Cuban president, Syed Hamid said.
</P>
<P>
"He (Special envoy) emphasized that it is a personal invitation
of Fidel Castro as Mahathir's presence will contribute effectively
and meaningfully to this summit (from April 11 to 14)," Syed Hamid
told reporters after meeting special envoy Miguel Angel Ramirez
Ramos here.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said the Havana gathering would discuss several key
areas such as globalization and its impact on developing economies.
</P>
<P>
Given the unstoppable nature of globalization which was having
an impact on South-South cooperation, it would only be natural for
the developing world to have its inputs to ensure that the process
would not affect them adversely, he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said he was informed by the special envoy
that the summit was intended as a preparatory discussion to enable
developing countries to play a more meaningful role when the
United Nations convenes its special assembly on the millennium in
New York in September.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Hold Parliamentary Elections in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe has announced that the country's parliamentary election
will be staged in the second week of April this year.
</P>
<P>
As he launched his two-pronged campaign in Epworth near Harare
on Sunday for the general election and a "yes" vote in the
up-coming referendum for a new constitution, Mugabe ruled out any
postponement of the elections as had been suggested by opposition
parties.
</P>
<P>
"The elections will be held in the second week of April after
the referendum on February 12 and 13. There is no need for anyone
to suggest that we postpone the elections to a later day because
it is mandatory that we hold them after five years, according to
the current constitution," he told a rally of about 15,000 people
in Epworth, about 15 km southeast of Harare.
</P>
<P>
He said it was important for Zimbabweans to give a nod for the
draft new constitution since the document scheduled to replace the
British-authored constitution would empower the people in many
ways.
</P>
<P>
"After the referendum, Parliament will pass the draft
constitution to be law and then elections will be held under the
constitution which seeks to empower the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the draft constitution sought to give land back to the
people, empower women and ensure children had the right to
education.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out any possibility that the government might pay farm
owners for land taken, unless the British government, Zimbabwe's
former colonial power, undertakes to do it.

<HEADLINE> WFP Pledges 40 Million Dollars for Uganda in Next Five Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP) is
planning to spend a total of 40 million U.S. dollars in Uganda in
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
WFP Deputy Country Director Michael Patrick Jones was quoted by
Monday' s Monitor daily as saying over the weekend that his agency
is doing its best to deal with food shortage in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
He said that WFP's supplies to the needy caters for up to 1.3
million Ugandans, adding that the assistance would also go to
other operational projects on education, health, rural
development and street children.
</P>
<P>
The WFP official also refuted some media reports that his
agency was pulling out of Uganda, arguing that they had been in
the African country for 25 years and could not plan to fund
projects and then retreat.
</P>
<P>
WFP is the United Nations' agency in the fight against global
hunger. In 1998, its relief workers fed 75 million people
including most of the world' s refugees. Headquartered in Rome,
Italy, WFP has food aid operations in 80 countries around the
world.

<HEADLINE> Public Bidding to Eradicate Lake Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 31 (Xinhua)-- China will hold a public bidding
for a project to clean up Dianchi Lake here in Kunming, the
capital of Yunnan Province in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
The bidding will invite international participants to find an
effective way to uproot the blue-green algae rampant in the lake,
and then to control all the sources of pollution in an area of
about 300 square kilometers around the lake, especially that from
pesticides, according to Li Jiating, governor of Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
The result of the bidding is expected to be announced in mid-
March. The Ministry of Science and Technology and the Yunnan
Science and Technology Commission will jointly handle the entire
bidding process.
</P>
<P>
Dianchi Lake, a famous scenic spot on a high plateau covering
307 square kilometers, is China's sixth-largest freshwater lake,
and plays a key role in balancing the ecological environment in
Kunming, known as the City of Spring.
</P>
<P>
However, the lake's water has become murky from the large
amount of industrial and domestic waste discharged into it over
the last 20 years, and fast-increasing algae, the growth of which
is encouraged by the chemicals and warm waters from sewage and
factories, is also clogging it up.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the Chinese government listed Dianchi Lake a key part
of the "three rivers and three lakes" (Liaohe, Huaihe and Haihe
rivers, and Taihu, Chaohu and Dianchi lakes) clearing project.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the government has earmarked billions of yuan to
clean up the deteriorating environment in the lake, and has
achieved some good results, said Li Jiating, but completely ending
the pollution will require constant efforts over a long period of
time.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Hopes for Cooperation with Multinationals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Province, one of
China's most important heavy industry bases in the northeast,
expects cooperation with multinational corporations in the fields
of machinery, metallurgy, petrochemicals, and electronics.
</P>
<P>
"Liaoning must facilitate cooperation with the multinationals
in order to cultivate new pillar industries of its own," said
Governor Zhang Guoguang, who led an economic and trade delegation
on a visit to the United States last year.
</P>
<P>
He said that Liaoning's machinery production will focus on
joint ventures producing both equipment in sets and key parts for
automobiles, jets, ships, and trains.
</P>
<P>
Zhang and his entourage visited U.S. companies including Boeing
and General Motors, and Canada's Ericsson, and the governor signed
nine contracts and 39 letters of intent with foreign businesses.
</P>
<P>
"Many multinationals were impressed by Liaoning's strong
industrial background, abundant resources, and geological edge,"
Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning, home to nearly one-tenth of China's large and medium-
sized state-owned enterprises (SOEs) with a total fixed asset of
500 billion yuan (over 60 billion U.S. dollars), is undergoing a
transitional period and industrial upgrading.
</P>
<P>
"Liaoning needs capital, technology, talent and management
experience during the process of industrial upgrading in order to
be competitive in the international market," Zhang said, adding
that Liaoning's development guidelines fully accord with the
strategies of many multinational corporations.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning plans to highlight its petrochemicals, in-depth
processing, plastics, chemical fibers, and fine process. The
metallurgy industry will invite foreign collaborators to produce
special steel and other steel materials badly needed on the
international market, and household electronic appliances are also
open to cooperative projects, he said.

WELLINGTON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Minister of
Foreign Affairs and Trade Phil Goff Monday welcomed the Biosafety
Protocol which was adopted Sunday at a United Nations-sponsored
conference in Montreal, Canada.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Goff said his country "is likely to be an early
signatory" when the document is open for signing at the next
meeting in May in Nairobi, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
"New Zealand has long pushed for a biosafety protocol to
protect against risks posed by the transfer of living genetically
modified organisms. We have a vital interest in protecting both
our agricultural production and natural biodiversity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Biosafety Protocol, strict rules are set for trade in
living organisms that have been altered genetically by scientists,
in an effort to protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
In addition to living organisms such as seeds, animals and
microbes, the deal also sets out trade rules for food, animal feed
and other products made from the organisms.
</P>
<P>
The Biosafety Protocol is regarded as creating a system
allowing countries to share research, set safety standards and
record shipments of bioengineered goods.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladeshi Opposition Protest Against Bill By Pan Xiaozhu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Opposition parties and student
organizations in Bangladesh Sunday strongly protested against the
enactment of Public Safety (Special Provisions) Bill - 2000 and
warned the government that they would stage tough campaigns
against it.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi parliament Sunday passed the controversial
Public Safety Bill. Offenses identified by the Bill include
hijacking, toll extortion, damage of vehicles and property,
obstruction to traffic, demanding ransom after kidnapping, causing
panic, false cases and instigation and abetting of crimes.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Sunday called on the people to
help her government enforce the law impartially to eliminate anti-
social acts from society and ensure public peace and safety.
</P>
<P>
She made the call immediately after parliament passed the bill
amidst the abstention of the main opposition parties and strong
criticism from a Jatiya Party faction MPs loyal to the government.
</P>
<P>
Allaying the opposition's fears about possible misuse of the
law as a weapon for political persecution, Hasina has said
repeatedly that in no way it would be used on political grounds.
</P>
<P>
Political parties and student organizations, including the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), Jatiya Party, Jamaat-e-Islami,
Islami Oikya Jote (Islami Solidarity Front) and an 11-party
alliance organized a series of protest rallies in the capital on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties termed the law as an anti-people one
designed to curb the fundamental rights of the people.
</P>
<P>
BNP Chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia on Sunday condemned the
government for the unilateral passage of "a new black law under
the cover of the Public Safety Act ignoring public opinion."
</P>

"It is not for public safety, the government, being isolated
and scared of mass movement, framed this black law to persecute
the opposition and the people," she said in a press statement.
</P>
<P>
She called for building a united movement against the enactment
of the law and urged people from all walks of life to observe a 36-
hour hartal (general strike) on Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader reportedly will ask President Shahabuddin
Ahmed not to give his assent to the controversial bill.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Hasina reportedly asked her
parliamentary deputies on Sunday to prepare for the next general
elections. She gave the instructions in a meeting of Awami League
Parliamentary Party held at Parliament House.
</P>
<P>
Although the elections are not due until next year, her remarks
suggest that parliamentary polls might be held anytime ahead of
the schedule, Awami League sources disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here said the core of politics in the
country is to show tolerance through compromises and understanding
and to create a law-abiding social environment. What is needed
most is not Public Safety Bill but the art of political compromise,
they said.

<HEADLINE> hke013115--Malaysia to Formulate Law on Efficient Energy Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has initiated
discussions on formulating a law pertaining to the efficient use
of energy to increase economic competitiveness and productivity, a
government minister said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Such a law has yet to be ready for implementation but
discussions have been initiated, Energy, Communications and
Multimedia Minister Leo Moggie said.
</P>
<P>
The government is more concerned about creating greater
awareness among the public in consuming energy more efficiently
instead of pushing the law, Moggie said at a function in Bangi
near here.
</P>
<P>
"First, you must make the public appreciate the fact that
energy efficiency is beneficial to them," he said, adding that
once this issue was resolved it could then look ahead to
implementing the law.
</P>
<P>
He said the law would be implemented gradually and no specific
timeframe had been set for it.
</P>
<P>
It would be better to introduce more products that can help use
energy efficiently, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said energy efficiency usage is one of the key components in
the national energy policy.
</P>
<P>
The government is taking steps to encourage the use of
renewable energy, he said, adding that with the greater use of
renewable energy, it would help cut down the consumption of energy
resources that are not renewable as well as reduce the negative
impact on the environment.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Canadians Urge for Early Reunification of China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The eight points offer a peaceful solution under the framework
of "one country, two systems" advanced by the late Chinese leader
Deng Xiaoping, though the Chinese government has never ruled out
using force in defense of national sovereignty and territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
Albert Tang, honorary President of the federation, said that
the people of Taiwan will sooner or later see the same benefits
their brothers and sisters in Hong Kong and Macao have already
enjoyed under the "one country, two systems" principle.
</P>
<P>
It is certainly in the interests of the people of Taiwan, which
would otherwise face the danger of war as a handful of separatists
attempt to split China in forms of "two countries", "one China and
one Taiwan" or "Taiwan independence", he noted.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Yao Rongping, head of a local Chinese school, said Taiwan
is an inalienable part of China and no secession should be allowed.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador Pei Ping told the gathering that more than
100 countries, including the United States and Canada, have
reiterated their support for the principle of "one China",
indicating the failure of attempts to use external influence to
split the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Canadian leaders believed the earlier the
reunification could be finalized, the better it would be for the
entire Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
They called on all overseas Chinese to unite in efforts to
promote the cause of reunification of the Chinese nation.

WARSAW, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Poland received 9 billion U.S.
dollars in foreign investment in 1999, 1.1 billion below the
record year of 1998, according to official statistics released
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Poland is the top eastern European country in terms of the
volume of foreign investment since 1994, with a total of 34
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Experts here attributed the fall in last year's foreign
investment partly to the poor performance of the country's macro-
economy troubled by growing deficits, high inflation and jobless
rates and slow economic growth.
</P>
<P>
They also cited political instability and lack of preferential
treatment as factors eroding foreign investors' confidence and
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
The statistics were based on a survey of foreign companies with
investment of over 1 million dollars in Poland.

<P>
OTTAWA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Canada's Jeremy Wotherspoon
wrapped up his third straight World Cup title Sunday, winning the
1,000 meters event in Calgary.
</P>
<P>
Wotherspoon, who broke his own world record in the 500m on
Saturday, won the 1,000m in one minute, 8.96 seconds. He set the
1,000m record of 1:08.49 earlier this year in the Canadian sprint
championships in Calgary.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that there was "a bit more pressure" because after
his world record-setting 500m victory, he was widely expected to
set a new world mark in the 1,000m event. "It alters your state
of mind when every person says they can't wait to see it happen.
When I'm getting ready for the 1,000 I'm not thinking I have to go
out and break a world record now."
</P>
<P>
Dutch star Jan Bos finished runner-up to him in 1:09.96.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Gianni Romme of the Netherlands broke his own world
record in the men's 5,000m, finishing in 6:18.72. He set the
previous mark of 6:21.59 two years ago in Calgary.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Gunda Niemannstirnemann broke her own mark in the
women's 3,000m. She finished in 4:00.51, improving the mark of 4:
01.67 set in Calgary in 1998.

BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese Foreign
Ministry official has warned the United States of a "serious
setback" in bilateral human rights talks if the U.S. introduces an
anti-China resolution to a UN human rights meeting in March, "
China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Sino-U.S. human rights dialogues will suffer a serious setback
if the United States introduces an anti-China resolution to the
United Nations Commission in March," today's China Daily quoted
Vice-Foreign Minister Wang Guangya as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that a dialogue on human rights between China and the
U.S. will not be possible if no concrete steps are taken by the U.
S. to eliminate the adverse effects of the anti-China resolution.
</P>
<P>
"Differences between developed and developing countries over
human rights should not become an obstacle to the development of
their relations, nor a means to interfere in other's internal
affairs," Wang said, who is also chief of the Chinese delegation
for Sino-U.S. human rights talks.
</P>
<P>
"Confrontation will not solve any problems, and no one should
venture to be the teacher of others," he said.

has also seen active progress, and the Chinese people have enjoyed
ever better social, economic and cultural rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And China now has the best human rights situation in its
history," Wang added.
</P>
<P>
Similar attempts to censure China have failed to get enough
votes eight times since 1990, the year of the 46th session of the
53-member U.N. Commission.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the United States again this year has raised "
concerns" about a range of issues, including the country's half-
year-old ban of the Falun Gong cult and China's treatment of
ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
Wang said this move shows that some people in the United States
"cling obstinately to the Cold War mentality and are trying to put
political pressure on China."
</P>
<P>
He said these people are using human rights as an excuse to
undermine China's political stability and development.
</P>
<P>
"That such a move is being launched, alongside the U.S.
partisan campaigns for the Presidential Election, indicates, to a
great extent, that it is catering to the wish of the anti-China
force in the U.S. and fishing for political capital," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Scapegoating China's human rights is without justification and
doomed to failure," he said.

<HEADLINE> Anti-China Attempt Would Hurt U.S. Ties: Paper (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the past year, the United States and other Western
countries have alleged that the Chinese government has intensified
its crackdown on "political dissent", for example by suppressing
the Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
"But to tolerate such a cult means trampling the basic human
rights of citizens," he said.
</P>
<P>
If the U.S. government can use military force to suppress the
Branch Davidian cult, how does the United States have the
qualification to make irresponsible comments on China's ban on
Falun Gong by law, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang stressed that only a very few Falun Gong activists who
have been proven by court to have broken the law have been
punished, adding that the United States itself has not scored well
in its human rights accounts among international circles.
</P>
<P>
Only two countries in the world did not join the Convention of
the Rights of the Child and the United States was one, the Chinese
vice-foreign minister said, adding that the U.S. congress also
took 15 years to approve the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights. Twenty-three years have passed since the U.S.
signing of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights, which promotes rights related to working, living
and education conditions. But the U.S. congress has yet to make
the international covenant legally binding in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. anti-China resolution also makes allegations
concerning China's Tibet Autonomous Region. Wang said that the
allegations are groundless.

<P>
Forty years ago, a very few top-ranking lamas and aristocrats
in Tibet controlled the lives of more than 95 percent of everyday
Tibetans, according to Wang. Today, Tibetans and members of other
ethnic groups, many of whom are sons and daughters of former serfs
and poverty-stricken farmers, manage the affairs of the autonomous
region. They account for 74.9 percent of the local government
officials.
</P>
<P>
In addition, forty years ago, no Tibetan woman was allowed in
local government. But today, Tibetan men and women are equal. At
present, Tibetan women are 32.8 percent of the region's leaders,
and Tibetans' freedom of religion is protected by law, he said,
adding that in recent years, China has engaged in dialogues and
exchanges with the E.U., U.S., Canada and other Western countries
on human rights.
</P>
<P>
China also has joined 17 international human rights covenants.
The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
will be considered by the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
"China consistently advocates handling and settling differences
on human rights between states through dialogue on the basis of
equality and mutual respect," he said.
</P>
<P>
Though faced with obstacles, China promised to participate
actively and constructively at the U.N. Commission meeting in
March, Wang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Winds and heavy snowstorm hit
Sweden, Denmark and Norway over the last weekend, causing damages
and great inconvenience in the region.
</P>
<P>
The strong winds blasted the southern areas of Sweden and
Denmark on Saturday, and swept across Norway and hinterland of
Sweden on the following day.
</P>
<P>
Winds gusted to more than 100 kilometers an hour, almost the
speed of hurricane, when reaching Denmark.
</P>
<P>
Power supplies and traffic were badly affected in Denmark where
transportation departments closed the Great Belt bridge and some
ferry boats shuttling between Stockholm and Malmo, the third
largest city of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
In Sweden, the winds, with speed of exceeding 70 kilometers an
hour, left 21,500 families out of electricity in Skaane, a city
near Denmark, and trains out of service for lacking power. Roads
around its western coast were also cut off, overwhelmed by weaves
as high as 1.5 meters.
</P>
<P>
Heavy snowstorm also hit northern parts of Sweden and Norway
along with the strong winds. Some roads and highways were closed
in both countries and the transportation departments urged
residents not to drive in case of danger.
</P>
<P>
At the night of Sunday, winds blowing in the southern and
middle parts of three countries became weakened while the weather
departments said the snowstorm in north was expected to continue
until Monday.
</P>
<P>
Europe has been attacked by several heavy storms since this
winter.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan National Constitution Assembly Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan National
Constitution Assembly was dismissed Sunday after a six-month term
during which it drafted a new constitution and restructured the
nation's judicial system.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela held national elections on three occasions on April
25, July 25, and December 15, last year, for the forming of the
assembly and the amendment of the constitution.
</P>
<P>
On August 3 the same year, the assembly was formed. However,
soon afterwards, it started strong confrontations with the former
National Congress and the Supreme Court, resulting in a much
weakened congress of only 20 members and in the resignation of the
Supreme Court president.
</P>
<P>
Because of the closure of the congressional member committee on
January 4, a 21-member "mini-congress" had to be formed on January
27 to handle legislative duties before the election of a new
National Congress in May or June when elections for state
governors, mayors and the presidency will also be held.

<HEADLINE> French Fencers Unhappy about Introduction of Transparent Masks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- A row has erupted among the world
's top fencers over the introduction of a new transparent fencing
mask aimed at making the sport more telegenic.
</P>
<P>
French fencers led the protests against the masks, especially
at a time when there are only seven months away from the start of
the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
French World team foil champion Jean-Noel Ferrari competing on
Sunday in the International Challenge here is ready to use his own
traditional mask, event at the expense of a fine. "There are too
many problems for respiration. I would rather pay a 50 dollar
fine than wear it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Other complaints about the new mask which had a trial run
during a junior competition in Budapest earlier this year included
lack of comfort, problems adjusting the visor and being too heavy.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the mask so I haven't tried it," said French
fencer Patrice Lhotellier. "We'll see, if there's a problem
perhaps we will see with our foreign colleagues and start a
petition, like the epee specialists."
</P>
<P>
Lhotellier was referring to an earlier protest led by double
Olympic and World epee champion Eric Srecki who will be competing
in his fourth and final Olympic games.
</P>
<P>
The current masks make it impossible to see the competitors
faces as in other sports. "They're acting like dinosaurs," said
Rene Roch, president of the International Federation of fencing (
FIE).
</P>
<P>
The FIE chief called on veteran fencers to support the
introduction of transparent masks, which was supposed to take
effect in April 99. But the athletes' commission appealed to wait
until after the World Championships in Seoul, which was accepted
by Roch.
</P>
<P>
A new attempt to bring the mask into competition will take
effect March 1 2000 but there are sure to be further protests.

<P>
LAGOS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- A major row was settled as the
Nigeria Football Association (NFA) has paid a 3,000 U.S. dollar
bonus to each player of the national team for their 4-2 victory
over Tunisia in the African Nations Cup, a team official said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The boys have now been paid their bonus for the win over
Tunisia. Each player received 3,000 dollars," said the official
who did not wish to be named.
</P>
<P>
The NFA held an emergency meeting in Lagos Saturday to discuss
the team bonuses and other issues.
</P>
<P>
After winning 4-2 in their opening match, Nigeria, one of the
tournament's favorites, drew 0-0 with lowly Congo. Local press
sited the dispute over win bonuses one of the reasons for that
result.
</P>
<P>
The national team refused 2,500 U.S. dollars offered each
player after the Tunisia match. The players insisted on the sum
of 3,000 each.

<HEADLINE> 376 Drug Cheats Caught in Australia in Last Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 31 (xinhua) -- Australia's high-profile anti-
doping stance has been tarnished after national figures revealed
on Monday that almost 400 drug cheats had been caught in the last
10 years.
</P>
<P>
The recent ban on cyclist Tim Lyons brought Australia's tally
of athletes caught using illegal substances in the last decade to
376, the Australian Sports Drug Agency (ASDA) said.
</P>
<P>
The staggering number of athletes included 111 from Olympic
disciplines in more than 30 sports.
</P>
<P>
The figures were disturbing reading for the the Australian
Olympic Committee (AOC), prompting calls for stricter penalties
for drug cheats.
</P>
<P>
"There is always the prospect of extenuating circumstances but
the general rule is that no athlete should be pleading: 'I didn't
know'," AOC secretary general Craig McLatchey said.
</P>
<P>
The record calls into question Australia's right to question
other countries' anti-doping policies.
</P>
<P>
Athletics Australia competition manager Brian Roe said the
figures showed Australia needed to ensure its own athletes were
clean before pointing the finger at others.
</P>
<P>
"We've always taken the view that it's improper to point the
finger because you never know when it's going to come back and
actually bite," he said.
</P>
<P>
ASDA chief Natalie Howson said the figures revealed Australia
had a drug cheat problem despite the fact positive results
represented less than two percent of the number of tests conducted.
</P>
<P>
"We do have problems, we're not foolproof -- we do have and
will continue to have people who will do anything to win and they
will cheat," she said.

<HEADLINE> Mummified Boy and Elderly Man Unearthed in NW China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI,January 31 (Xinhua) -- Mummified remains of a baby boy
and an elderly man, dating back some 4,000 years and 2,000 years
respectively, were recently unearthed in the ruins of an ancient
kingdom along the Silk Road in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists said the mummified boy, believed about 4,000
years old, was around six months old at the time of his death. He
was found wrapped in coarse swaddling and wearing a pointed felt
hat and leather boots. At his left side was a straw basket, which
Chinese experts speculated as the boy's favorite toy.
</P>
<P>
He lay in a tomb similar in shape and style to the funeral pit
of the first Caucasian mummy known as the "Loulan Beauty," which
was discovered at the same site in 1980 by Chinese archeologist Mu
Shunying.
</P>
<P>
"Though the mummified boy lay almost bare on the ground, he was
well-preserved. We can see clearly his light brown hair, deep-set
eyes and eyelids," said Zhang Yuzhong, deputy director of the
Xinjiang Research Institute of Cultural Relies and Archeology.
</P>
<P>
The race of the baby could not be determined yet. But
archeologists theorized he was Caucasian and lived in the same era
as the Loulan Beauty.
</P>
<P>
A cultural relics expert said the discovery of the mummified
boy unveils a period of history some 4,000 years ago about which
little is known, when a team of nomadic Europeans came to the
ancient Kingdom of Kroraina (Loulan), which locals call "China's
Pompeii in the desert," and then left the area, leaving a number
of mummies behind.
</P>
<P>
In another tomb about 100 meters from the boy's tomb, Chinese
archeologists excavated a 2,000-year-old mummified elderly man in
a coffin decorated with colorful paintings. Traditional designs
from central China were painted on both ends of the coffin.
</P>
<P>
"This was the first colored coffin ever discovered at Loulan.
The coffin was bright-colored and well-preserved when it was
unearthed," said an archeologist.
</P>
<P>
The man wore a robe, trousers, and socks made of white cotton.
The mummy's face was covered by two light yellow cotton cloths.
Much of his dark brown hair had turned gray at the time of his
death.
</P>
<P>
Experts inferred he was Mongolian and lived sometime between
the Han and Jin dynasties (221 B.C.-420 A.D.).
</P>
<P>
Also unearthed from the tomb was a wool blanket, and lacquer
dishes featuring designs popular in central China.
</P>
<P>
The discovery verifies the important position of Loulan, once a
thriving state along the Silk Road but later buried by the
shifting Taklamakan desert in Xinjiang, as a place of convergence
of four civilized nations -- China, India, Greece and Persia,
Zhang said. It also provides important clues to the research into
the origins of human race at Loulan.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Carbuyers to Obtain GM Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.-based General Motors
expects to begin extending credit to Chinese carbuyers after China
's entry to the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The company has invested two billion US dollars in China over
the past few years, and the GM Acceptance Corp that provides
financial services is busy preparing for its loan program in China,
today's China Daily quoted GM officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Zahner, president of GM China Group, said on Saturday
that discussions are underway between GM and Chinese banks, and
the service is likely to start as soon as China enters the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-U.S. pact on China's WTO entry reportedly allows U.S.
auto makers to offer financial services in China.
</P>
<P>
GM senior executives expect that China will become the world's
largest auto market and the company is apparently planning an
offensive approach towards the market.
</P>
<P>
GM sold 22,300 vehicles in China last year, and had reaped
profits of 600 million yuan (72 million US dollars) thanks to
extra production of Buick cars in Shanghai, Lawrence said.
</P>
<P>
GM's joint venture, Shanghai GM Automobile Co., plans to
produce 50,000 Buicks this year, while GM will also start mass
production of the Chevrolet Blazer and Chevrolet S-10 pickup
trucks in Shenyang, capital of Liaoning Province.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Calls For Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid Sunday called on the nation to strengthen unity
and their sense of brotherhood, national newspapers reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We should not be easily deceived by unconfirmed news or
information," Wahid said in a written address read out by the
Defense Forces' (TNI) Commander Admiral Widodo A.S. at a
commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the death of General
Sudirman, the founding father of the Indonesian military, in
Yogyakarta, East Java.
</P>
<P>
"Amid the present level of freedom it is easy for people to
manipulate news, to make the wrong right and the right wrong," he
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wahid also called on the people not to rashly blame others from
different groups for the nation's problems.
</P>
<P>
"Respecting one another is something far better to do. So, let
us develop our care for others as proof that we are good religious
followers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said Indonesians must maintain unity by avoiding mistrust
and not being easily incited into fighting each other.
</P>
<P>
The president admitted TNI faces many challenges in the reform
era, such as widespread public criticism over its past role.
</P>
<P>
"In this open era, what we actually need is a more civilized,
ethical and moral way of lodging criticism and suggestion," he
added.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Widodo called on the public to be patient in
allowing the process of reform within TNI, which he said would
take a long time.
</P>
<P>
Widodo added that TNI could only develop into a professional,
effective and efficient force in a conducive atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Army Chief of Staff General Tyasno Sudarto dismissed
concerns that the military would try to mount a coup while the
president was traveling overseas, saying that he would put his job
on the line.
</P>
<P>
"I guarantee there will be no coup. If there's one, I will
relinquish my job," Tyasno was quoted by the Antara News Agency as
saying in Surabaya, East Java, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
TNI officers have repeatedly dismissed the rumors of a coup as
"unfounded."
</P>
<P>
Minister of Defense Juwono Sudarsono, the first civilian to
hold the post, has also brushed aside the rumors, saying last week
that TNI had neither the ability nor the intention to mount a coup.

SHENYANG, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Benxi Iron and Steel Co. (
Group) has reduced its staff by two-thirds, while China's average
steel production per capita doubled to more than 100 tons last
year.
</P>
<P>
Benxi Iron and Steel Co. (Group) with a history of 95 years,
once had over 87,000 employees. However, most of them worked in
various supplementary units other than the iron and steel
production section.
</P>
<P>
It used to be that working in a state-owned enterprise (SOE) in
China was like working in a self-contained community complete with
school, clinic, grocery store, dining hall and post office.
</P>
<P>
Now, faced with heavy financial burdens, few SOEs are as
competitive as private businesses in the new market economy.
Liaoning Province, one of China's traditional industrial bases in
the northeast, pioneered the reform in 1994 to help SOEs establish
a modern enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
More and more SOEs separated themselves from the their
supplementary units, such as kindergartens, schools, and clinics.
</P>
<P>
Benxi Iron and Steel Co. has helped 22 of its auxiliary units
become independent, and by doing so, the big steel producer
markedly improved its efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yuying, chairman of the board of directors of Fushun
Special Steel Group Co., said that his company has returned to the
intensive market competition with a much lighter load.
</P>
<P>
"My company is a real company now," Zhang said, "I can spend
more time on the market. The company is no longer a 'mini-society'
in charge of everything."
</P>
<P>
Zhang's company gave up seven supplementary units, resulting in
the lay-off of some 4,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the provincial economic and trade commission said
that 60 key SOEs in the province have eliminated 768 units, which
account for two-thirds of all such units affiliated with SOEs of
the province.
</P>
<P>
The reform has saved three billion yuan (about 361 million U.S.
dollars) in government subsidies to these units, or 84 percent of
the total subsidies offered by the government.
</P>
<P>
The supplementary units, which will sell stock in the company
to their employees, will be diverted into subsidiary companies of
the SOEs and will then be responsible for their own profits and
losses, according to a provincial government official.

<HEADLINE> World's Earliest Cambrian Fossils Found in SW China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and German scientists
in southwest China's Guizhou Province claim they have discovered
the world's earliest fossilized animals belonging to the Cambrian
period.
</P>
<P>
Studies of the fossils, unearthed in Zhongnan village in the
city of Zunyi, reveal that the "Cambrian explosion" was not as
abrupt and dramatic as previously thought, said Professor Zhao
Yuanlong of the Industrial University of Guizhou.
</P>
<P>
The fossils, believed to date back 535 million years, are in
eight categories, including sponges, large bivalve arthropods,
algae, echinoderms, and hemichordates.
</P>
<P>
Studies of the fossils show that there were no abrupt changes
in the evolution of sponges during the Precambrian and Cambrian
periods, said Zhao, who headed the Sino-German joint research team.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, the Cambrian explosion theory, which
considers the period the origin of the diversification of life on
the planet as we now know it, needs to be rethought.
</P>
<P>
Dr. M. Stainer of the Berlin Industrial University and also the
man who discovered the fossils, said that the fossil find at Zunyi
is of great significance for research into the origin and
evolution of early life.
</P>
<P>
The research project, which began in early 1998, was jointly
sponsored by the China National Natural Science and the German
Natural Science Fund.
</P>
<P>
The Zunyi fossils are believed to date back 1-2 million years
earlier than fossils discovered in the mid 1980s in Chengjiang,
about 100 kilometers from the Yunnan provincial capital of Kunming.
</P>
<P>
Fossils found in Poland in 1975 were thought at that time to be
the earliest fossils belonging to the Cambrian period. But these
newly discovered fossils are estimated to be 500,000 to one
million years earlier.
</P>
<P>
An article explaining the significance of the finding will soon
be published in the supplement of the latest issue of the Chinese
periodical Paleontology Studies.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Department Stores Keep Calm About Gold Fever Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- A number of department stores
in Beijing did not anticipate a sudden fever for purchasing gold
bars.
</P>
<P>
Half of the 500 gold bars in Guiyou Department Store were sold
by January 26, one week since sales started. The rest of the gold
is expected to be sold before Spring Festival next Friday, said
Luo Min, manager of the store's Public Relations section.
</P>
<P>
Selling gold is not as profitable as people imagine. Stores
will only earn a dozen yuan of profits per gram after paying taxes
and other miscellaneous fees.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that continuous drop of gold prices on the
international market has discouraged people to buy up gold bars as
an investment.
</P>
<P>
Gold jewelry in stores values at 95 yuan (about 11.4 U.S.
dollar) per gram, while the prices for gold bars are 98 yuan and
104 yuan respectively, much higher than the market price.
</P>
<P>
Guiyou also has not looked forward to another frenzied bout of
gold buying.
</P>
<P>
Gold bars have been selling extremely well in other cities
across China including Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
The sales of gold bars in department stores suggest that gold
has become a new form of investment for the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that China has sold gold bars to the
public since 1949. The decision by the People's Bank of China to
share its 1.5 tons of coveted metal with the public is considered
by analysts as a bold step forward to opening China's gold market.

HEFEI, January 31 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province found
1,577 local people guilty of misconduct in the performance of
their duties and of taking bribery, embezzling public funds, and
practicing favoritism last year.
</P>
<P>
Cracking down on these cases has helped reduce economic losses
of more than 60 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The number of the convicted offenders grew by 4.2 percent over
the 1998 figure due to increased local efforts in cracking down on
dereliction of duty.
</P>
<P>
Of the total found guilty, 468 were once employees of the local
Party, government administration, judicatory, or economic

<HEADLINE> China's Steel Giant to Center on High Technologies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Capital Iron and Steel
Company, one of China's major steel producers, aims to become a hi-
tech-oriented complex in the next ten years.
</P>
<P>
By 2010, the company's output value from high and new
technologies will account for half of its total industrial output
value, said the company's general manager Luo Bingsheng recently.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this goal, the company will focus efforts on the
development, design, and production of software and computer chips
this year and in next few years, Luo added.
</P>
<P>
The company's three major production components -- software,
integrated circuits and micro-electronics -- have already signed
cooperative agreements with prestigious Qinghua University and the
Software Research Institute attached to the Chinese Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
A high-tech company with Luo as president was registered late
last month in Zhongguancun, known as China's "Silicon Valley."
</P>
<P>
Since they began producing large integrated circuits in
cooperation with NEC of Japan in 1995, the Capital Iron and Steel
Company has secured the country's second-largest market share for
these products, after Motorola.
</P>
<P>
The sales income and overseas business volume of the Capital
Iron and Steel Company from its non-steel sector has reached 15.31
billion yuan (1.84 billion U.S. dollars), making up 48.3 percent
of the company's total.
</P>
<P>
The company's pre-tax profits reached 980 million yuan (118
million dollars) in 1999, or 40 million yuan (4.8 million dollars)
more than 1998, despite a 10 percent cut in production.

<HEADLINE> Terra Cotta Museum Hosting More Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The museum housing the thousands
of terra cotta warriors and horses that were buried along with
Chinese emperor Qin Shihuang nearly 2,000 years ago had 1.56
million visitors last year, up 12 percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
The museum's revenue totaled 95.76 million yuan (11.3 million U.
S. dollars) in 1999, an increase of 17 percent over the previous
year, and ranking second only to the Palace Museum (Forbidden City)
in Beijing, according to the museum's curator, Wu Yongqi.
</P>
<P>
This year, the museum plans further excavations at the site in
cooperation with several archaeological teams to prepare for the
construction of a relics museum.
</P>
<P>
Repair work on the relics unearthed will be accelerated, said
Wu.
</P>
<P>
The museum, 37 kilometers east of Xi'an, the capital of
northwestern China's Shaanxi Province, opened to the public 21
years ago. It houses over 7,000 life-sized terra cotta warriors
and horses first discovered in 1974.
</P>
<P>
The lifelike soldiers and horses have been referred to as the
8th wonder of the world. They were made over 2,200 years ago
during the Qin Dynasty (221 BC - 207 BC) and were buried less than
a mile from the emperor's tomb to insure his glory in the
afterlife.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 31 (Xinhua)-- Traditional industries in
Liaoning Province in northeast China have survived thanks to the
persistent growth of capital investment from around the world.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians, Israel Discuss Maps of Third Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian and Israeli negotiators
on Monday resumed talks over maps of the third phase stage Israeli
redeployment in the West Bank under the Sharm el Sheikh memorandum.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak ordered the Israeli Defense
Forces to start redeployment through February 10, Radio Israel
quoted Israeli sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
No changes have been introduced to the original maps prepared by
the Israeli side, although the Palestinians demanded the handover
of areas other than Abu Dis, a town near Jerusalem, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The third redeployment from a further 6.1 percent of the West
Bank, originally slated for January 20, was postponed by the
Israeli government, which angered the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
During his recent visit to Cairo, Barak promised that Israel
would hand over more territories to the Palestinian side within 10
days.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said on
Monday that the Palestinians would not accept Abu Dis only as
capital of their future state, stressing their claim for the whole
city of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion of making Abu Dis capital of the future state
is "categorically unthinkable," Erekat said. "There is a unified
Jerusalem which has been occupied since the 1967 aggression and on
which the U.N Resolution 242 was passed," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Israel should hand over the Old City of Jerusalem which
includes the Aqsa Mosque and Doomsday Church, if it was true in its
pursuit of historic reconciliation," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh has earlier said
Abu Dis could be carved out of Jerusalem in order to become capital
of a future Palestinian entity.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Israeli right-wing Likud Eriel Sharon expressed
strong opposition to the idea, citing that it would be a prelude to
the division of the unified holy city.
</P>
<P>
Sharon entered a no-confidence motion in the Knesset
(parliament) against Barak's government, accusing Barak of making
light of the interests of the Jewish state during talks with the
Palestinians and Syrians. The Knesset started studying the move
this evening.
</P>
<P>
Israel claims the whole Jerusalem, including the east section it
seized from Jordan in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, its "eternal and
undivided capital". The Palestinians, however, want the
traditionally Arab part as their future capital.
</P>
<P>
On the other front, Palestinian and Israeli negotiators wound up
their second day talks on final status issues at midday Monday at
an undisclosed location near Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Palestinian chief negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo
said the talks made no progress and would be continued on Tuesday
and Wednesday. The marathon talks are designed to nail down a
framework agreement on the final status issues by February 13.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Back Home from Davos Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein returned home Monday after attending the 30th World
Economic Forum conference in Davos, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah's trip to Davos was part of his busy diplomatic agenda
to rally international support for the economy of his desert
kingdom. Jordan has been suffering economic woes since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Davos World Economic Forum was also attended by over 30
heads of state and hundreds of decision-makers, world-renowned
experts and business leaders.
</P>
<P>
The forum helped Abdullah build up his own image in the
international arena after he assumed the throne last February
following the death of his father, King Hussein, one of the longest
serving rulers of the world.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote speech to the forum on Sunday, he briefed the
participants on business and investment opportunities to attract
the much-needed foreign capital into the kingdom, which saw record-
high foreign debts of 7.8 billion U.S. dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The young king has made it his first priority to develop the
national economy and alleviate poverty among the 4.7 million
Jordanians, one third of whom are living under the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
He had encouraged his government to adopt a series of social,
economic and administrative reforms, including the privatization of
key but non-profitable public enterprises upon pressure from
international lenders and creditors.
</P>
<P>
The efforts started to pay off by the end of 1999, which saw an
economic growth rate of 1.5 to 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The chronic economic stagnation of Jordan was partly due to its
sympathy with Iraq after President Saddam Hussein's troops invaded
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
For nearly a decade, Jordan had been isolated by Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait and other Gulf states for its siding with Iraq during the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah has been making efforts to mend Jordan's ties with Gulf
states.

<P>
Barak issued this warning after holding an urgent meeting with
his security cabinet ministers to discuss the new development
inside the Israeli-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel's peace talks with Syria will not resume until Syria
reined in Hezbollah, Barak said in a statement. The peace talks

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Postpones No-confidence Vote Against PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Knesset, or
parliament, postponed the scheduled no-confidence vote Monday
evening against Prime Minister Ehud Barak over his funding
irregularities in last elections.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary sources said that the vote was put off because of
the current tense situation in the security zone in southern
Lebanon, where three Israeli soldiers were killed earlier Monday.
</P>
<P>
The motion, submitted by the largest opposition bloc Likud, was
a response to the state comptroller's report on the alleged illegal
funding activities of Barak's One Israel coalition in last year's
general elections.
</P>
<P>
During Monday's debate, Likud leader Ariel Sharon said the fund-
raising scandal has undermined Barak's peace process credibility,
including his pledge not to divide Jerusalem with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister in Prime Minister's Office Haim Ramon
responded to the motion by accusing the Likud of coming to discuss
the no-confidence motion with unclean hands.
</P>
<P>
He said that police also launched investigation against the
Likud over campaign financial improprieties.
</P>
<P>
State Comptroller Eliezer Goldberg published his report last
Thursday, saying that Barak's coalition established a system of
channeling illegal funds into a group of non-profitable
organizations (NPOs) to help his campaign.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen parties were found to have violated the Campaign
Finance Law, but Goldberg said violations by One Israel were the
most conspicuous and Barak's behavior should be put to a "public
trial.
</P>
<P>
"The criminal investigation into the funding violations, ordered
by Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein immediately after the
report's publishing, has been launched Sunday night."
</P>
<P>
Barak denied that he had any connection to the alleged
wrongdoings of the NPOs. He insisted that he had not been involved
in the details of fund-raising, and was unaware of the specific
activities outlined in the comptroller's report.
</P>
<P>
Some political analysts worried that at a critical point of
Middle East peace process, any embarrassment in the fund-raising
scandal will damage Barak's peace efforts.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Mission in East Timor Issues First Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The first three months
of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (
UNTAET) have seen "strenuous efforts" to set the foundations for
an independent East Timor, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In his first report to the Security Council on the work of the
UNTAET which covers the activities of the UNTAET since last
October 25, Annan said the UNTAET has established the basic
elements of an administrative structure and is actively
coordinating humanitarian assistance efforts.
</P>
<P>
The devastating effects of the systematic destruction and
violence last September, however, and the consequent cessation of
civil and public services will continue to be serious impediments
for the foreseeable future, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief noted 80 percent of the population currently
lacks visible means of support, and more than 50 percent is
illiterate.
</P>
<P>
He said substantial efforts will need to be made to educate
and train the population and for the time being, humanitarian
agencies are one of the largest employers in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The UNTAET was established in October 1999. Its mandate is to
provide security and maintain law and order throughout the
territory of East Timor; to establish an effective administration;
to assist in the development of civil and social services; to
ensure the coordination and delivery of humanitarian assistance,
rehabilitation and development assistance; to support capacity -
building for self-government; and to assist the establishment of
conditions for sustainable development.

<HEADLINE> Panama Looks for Treaty Revision with USA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Panama will start
consulting with all political and social sectors to review the
Neutrality Treaty of Panama Canal signed with the United States,
Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Aleman announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the treaty, which came into force for perpetuity
after 31 December 1999, the United States assumes the right of
unilaterally intervening in the Central American country if Panama
Canal security is in danger.
</P>
<P>
Aleman said Panama earned itself such respect because it is
capable of an efficient administration of the Panama canal,
delivered by the United States on December 31, and consolidating
its democracy.
</P>
<P>
"Our nation must make public manifestation, at highest level,
of its own policy of neutrality," Aleman said during a seminar on
relations between both nations held at the National University of
Panama.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Mission Blames Indonesia's Army for Violence in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The International
Commission of Inquiry on East Timor Monday blamed Indonesia's army
for violence which took place last year in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the United Nations, the commission, which
visited East Timor from November 25 to December 3 and interviewed
more than 170 people, concluded, "The intimidation, terror,
destruction of property, displacement and evacuation of people
would not have been possible without the active involvement of the
Indonesian army, and the knowledge and approval of the top
military command."
</P>
<P>
"The commission is of the view that ultimately the Indonesian
army was responsible for the intimidation, terror, killings and
other acts of violence experienced by the people of East Timor
before and after the popular consultation," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Particular individuals, who were not named in the report, were
directly involved in violation of human rights, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report recommended that the United Nations establish an
international human rights tribunal to prosecute those responsible
for the violence in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
In a separate letter to the United Nations, Indonesia's Foreign
Minister Alwi Shihab angrily denounced the probe, saying that it
was one-sided, selective and did not adequately address human
rights violations by pro-independence groups.
</P>
<P>
The commission was established in accordance with the U.N.
Commission on Human Rights resolution adopted on September 27,
1999, as endorsed by the Economic and Social Council in its
decision of November 15, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Diplomat Warns U.S. on Taiwan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- A Senior Chinese diplomat
warned here Monday that the proposed Taiwan Security Enhancement
Act in the U.S. Congress will bring about serious damage to the
bilateral relations between China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Yu Shuning, minister-counselor and spokesman of the Chinese
embassy in the United States, said that the act, if it is adopted
and becomes law, will undermine the very basis of China-U.S.
relations.
</P>
<P>
"The Taiwan issue is the most sensitive core issue in the China-
U.S. relations," Yu said at a press conference. "In the three
China-U.S. joint communiques, the U.S. undertook solemn commitment
to one China policy and Taiwan is part of China."
</P>
<P>
He said the act will harm peace and stability in the Taiwan
Straits and the Asia Pacific region and trigger another round of
arms race in the region.
</P>
<P>
It will also embolden the separatists in Taiwan to go further
on the road of independence, he said, urging the U.S. government
to take measures to prevent the act from becoming law.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said that on the Taiwan issue, increased U.S.
sales of advanced weapons to Taiwan, the U.S. support of Taiwan's
participation in the World Health Organization and the proposed
Taiwan Security Enhancement Act constitute serious infringement on
China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that in order to have smooth development of China-U.
S. relations, the principles as enshrined in the three China-U.S.
joint communiques, especially the principle of mutual respect for
each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-
interference in each other's internal affairs, should be strictly
adhered to," he said. "Otherwise, our bilateral relations will
suffer setbacks."
</P>
<P>
Yu said China is strongly opposed to the U.S. decision to table
an anti-China resolution at this year's session of the U.N. Human
Rights Commission in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Support of Falun Gong by the U.S. and its accusation against
China for banning this evil cult threaten to become another issue
which will come in the way of sound China-U.S. relations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Yu Shuning said China, as always, will work with the U.S. to
widen the common ground and handle the differences properly to
ensure a stable China-U.S. relationship to benefit the two peoples
and the world as well.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Currency Devaluates Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican currency, metical,
devalued against the U.S. dollar by 1.5 percent in January, an
alarming speed of depreciation in a single month.
</P>
<P>
On the official exchange market, metical started the year at
13,300 to the U.S. dollar. On Friday, the figure was 13,500, a
fall of about 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the illegal parallel exchange market, the fall was even
sharper -- from about 13,900 to 14,200 to the U.S. dollar, a
devaluation of 2.1 percent. The difference between the official
and the parallel rates is now 5.2 percent, considerably higher
than the Bank of Mozambique had hoped.
</P>
<P>
Cited in Monday's issue of the daily newsheet "Metical", one of
the central bank's administrators, Antonio Pinto de Abreu, said
that a devaluation of over one percent in a single month was
excessively high.
</P>
<P>
According to Abreu, metical had come under pressure from
several directions, including the strength of the American economy
and hence of the U.S. dollar, and the decision of the South
African Reserve Bank to align rand to the U.S. dollar rather than
let it depreciate still further.
</P>
<P>
Additional factors are the political uncertainty surrounding
the December general elections, and the annual drain on the
country's foreign currency, he said.
</P>
<P>
Metical has been a remarkably stable currency since 1996.

<P>
NAIROBI, January 31(Xinhua) -- Rwandan population, estimated at
273 people per square kilometers in 1997, has the highest density
in Africa, Rwanda News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted a socio-economic survey contained in a
United Nations Economic Commission for Africa report as saying
that Rwanda has an annual population growth estimated at 3.6
percent per year and a crude birth rate estimated at 43.3 per 1000
people.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the population densities for Burundi, Uganda,
South Africa and Zimbabwe are only 245, 99, 33 and 29 people per
square kilometers, respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the annual population growth for
Rwanda is also higher than that for other African countries, which
is 2.7 percent for Uganda, 2.6 percent for Burundi, 2.9 percent
for Zimbabwe and 2.3 percent for South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda's total population is estimated at 7.9 million with the
majority (94 percent) living in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda remains the least urbanized country in Africa, the

<HEADLINE> UNCTAD, Ethiopia Discuss Investment Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Conference for Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and Ethiopian
investment authorities held a seminar here on Monday focusing on
promotion of investment cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Opening the workshop, Ethiopian Trade and Industry Minister
Kassahun Ayele said that Ethiopia had initiated a profound
economic reform policy which paved a better way for attracting
foreign direct investment.
</P>
<P>
Supportive institutions to create suitable investment
environment in the country have also been established, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Kassahun, the Ethiopian government has approved
more than 5, 000 investment projects with a combined capital of 33
billion birr (about four billion U.S. dollars) so far following
the enactment of the new economic policy.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, despite the favorable investment environment
in Ethiopia, only 205 approved projects, with an aggregate capital
of 10 billion birr (about 1.2 billion U.S. dollars), are foreign
direct investment (FDI) projects.
</P>
<P>
This is because of the negative image attached to Ethiopia as a
result of recurrent drought, famine and civil strife in the
country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tesfachew Teffere, special assistant of UNCTAD Deputy General,
observed that reinforcing domestic investment opportunities and
building links among supportive institutions play a pivotal role
in attracting foreign direct investment.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Report on N.Ireland Decommissioning Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The presentation of a crucial
report on paramilitary arms decommissioning which will have an
impact on the Northern Ireland peace process has been delayed.
</P>
<P>
It is thought the report will be presented to the British and
Irish governments later on Monday, to allow extra time to try and
break the deadlock over the arms issue.
</P>
<P>
Senior government officials have been involved in last-minute
talks ahead of the report, which is being presented privately to
them by Canadian General John de Chastelain.
</P>
<P>
If the report concludes that the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in
particular has not moved towards disarmament, the future of
Northern Ireland's executive could be at stake.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the report may not be made public until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But while Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble has said there
is still time for republicans to move, he told BBC Radio Ulster's
Talkback program on Monday that he had a "suspicion that the
general would have nothing to report".
</P>
<P>
Trimble could be forced by his party's ruling council to honor
his November pledge to resign from the executive if General de
Chastelain does not report decommissioning has started.
</P>
<P>
But he repeated his suggestion that as a fallback measure the
British government could suspend the executive and temporarily
resume direct rule.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the general reported that the IRA had laid out a "form
of words," would that be enough to keep the process on track,
Trimble said republicans had already promised that decommissioning
would start"as soon as possible" during the November Mitchell
review.
</P>
<P>
He said his party had "taken risks" by forming the executive
with Sinn Fein before IRA decommissioning and they now expected "
action" in return.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland Assembly is due to debate the report on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ulster Unionist deputy leader John Taylor predicted
the executive will probably fall with a consequent return to
direct rule.
</P>
<P>
"The good news for unionists is that it is going to be a better
form of British direct rule than it was two years ago," he said,
referring to the dropped constitutional claim by the Republic over
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
British sources insisted on Sunday night they had not lost hope
of a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman said: "We are not suggesting a rabbit will be
pulled out of the hat. We are not saying the situation is
brilliant, but these things in Northern Ireland have a tendency to
go right down to the wire."
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams has insisted he could not
guarantee that the IRA would decommission its weapons even by May -
the objective set in the Good Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Adams said both sides had to give each other space, and
insisted Sinn Fein had not reneged on any understanding.
</P>
<P>
He said there was no prospect of decommissioning if the power-
sharing executive collapsed and this would lead to the creation of
a potentially dangerous political vacuum.

<HEADLINE> Argentine President Reiterates Selling Presidential Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Argentina's head of state
Fernando de la Rua ratified Monday his wish to sell Presidential
Airplane "Tango 01" and replace it with a smaller one in order to
halt high expenses for use of this craft.
</P>
<P>
De la Rua told a press conference he gave after returning from
his trip to Stockholm and Davos, where the president and his
committee traveled to in commercial airline planes.
</P>
<P>
The leader said there's no difference between traveling in "
Tango 01" and a commercial plane, therefore he wants to replace
this "Tango 01" for a smaller craft, according to the kind of
retinue which must be "reduced and austere."
</P>
<P>
Monday, upon arriving at Ezeiza international airport,
President De la Rua paid the taxes for purchases made outside at
the airport's customs and considered this "absolutely natural."
</P>
<P>
To this regard, De la Rua said with this attitude he wishes "
everyone to fulfill the law whereby we all have to pay our taxes,
there are no exclusions or privileges, nor ostentation" for
carrying ut this measure.
</P>
<P>
Two of the Argentine government's objectives are to reduce the
fiscal deficit and fight tax evasion harming the nation's welfare
so much.

<HEADLINE> Putin Calls for Tough Law Dictatorship in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Acting Russian President
Vladimir Putin on Monday urged to adopt tough legal system and law
dictatorship to restore confidence in Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Russian justice agencies should act more decisively and the
Justice Ministry should be more resolute in establishing the
uniform juridical space in the country, Putin said at an enlarged
meeting of the Russian Justice Ministry board here.
</P>
<P>
"We are suffocating from the absence of fundamental legislation
adequate to the changing situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This does not mean that everything should be dumped, but it is
impermissible that the country should be living according to laws
written under a different system of government," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the need for the dictatorship of law in Russia."
The dictatorship of law is the only kind of dictatorship which we
must obey," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the context of the need to speed up law making he said that
the whole job should not be lumped on the State Duma (the lower
house of the Russian Parliament) alone. The government, in
particular, the Justice Ministry should assume a more energetic
stance on the matter, Putin said.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the speedy approval of the land, labor,
civil and criminal proceeding codes.
</P>
<P>
Putin acutely criticized current situation of Russia's justice.
"So far Russia does not have a well-thought out, calculated law-
making policy," he said, adding that 20 percent of recent
legislation contradicts Russian laws and in some cases restricts
human rights.
</P>
<P>
He said the contradiction between laws in several Russian
regions and federal laws "may reach a critical point capable of
blasting the common constitutional space."
</P>
<P>
However, Putin said that freedom without law and order"
inevitably tumbles down to chaos and lawlessness." People should
have faith in the power of law. Russia can be made a strong power
only on the fundamental principals of observing law and personal
liberties," he said.

<HEADLINE> Simitis: Greece Awaits Turkey's Positive Moves for Better Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis Monday urged Turkey to take the moves that Greece is
awaiting to further improve the relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Simitis made the appeal following talks with his visiting
Swedish counterpart, Goran Persson, on the European Union (EU)
expansion, Greek-Turkish relations and Greece's entry into the
European Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
Simitis said in a joint press conference that Greece has taken
steps towards rapprochement, whereby Turkey must now prove in
earnest that the decisions at the EU Helsinki summit last December
are not simply an "acceptance of a candidacy, but a basis for
specific moves.""It is these moves that we are awaiting," he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Helsinki decisions set out a framework of
conditions that Turkey must gradually fulfill.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Greece and Turkey have been strained for
decades over their disputes in the territorial waters, air space
limits and the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean
Sea, and the Cyprus problem, but the two long-time rivals have
since last June taken some steps to improve their relations.
</P>
<P>
As a goodwill gesture, Greece abandoned its right at the EU
Helsinki summit to veto the union's decision to allow Turkey to
become a EU candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou also conducted an
official visit to Turkey late this month and signed with his
Turkis counterpart, Ismail Cem, four agreements for bilateral
cooperation on tourism, investment, security and the environment.

<HEADLINE> Europe's Main Stocks Slide On Rate Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 31 (Xinhua) - Europe's main stock markets all
ended sharply down Monday amid expectations of higher global
interest rates in the week.
</P>
<P>
The interest rates concern hit financial service, drug and
technology shares hardest. London's benchmark FTSE 100 closed 107
points, or 1.68 percent lower, at 6268.50.
</P>
<P>
The pan-European FTSE Eurotop 300, which reflects the mood
across the region, closed down almost 2 percent at 1498.38, with
its utility, mining and technology segments the worst hit.
</P>
<P>
The weak financial stocks weighed on the FTSE 100, with
National Westminster Bank the leading decline; it closed 7 percent
lower before Monday's midnight deadline for hostile takeover bids
from two Scottish banks.
</P>
<P>
Other financial stocks lost ground on the gloomy interest rate
outlook. Halifax, Britain's largest mortgage lender, fell 3.3
percent, while Alliance &AMP; Leicester slipped 3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Xetra Dax in Frankfurt was the weakest of the major bourses,
closing down 3.27 percent at 6835.60, while the CAC 40 in Paris
fell 1.2 percent to 5659.81.

The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 201.66 at 10,940.53.
The blue chip index fell 289.15 points last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 34.30 at 1,394.46 and the technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index rose 53.28 at 3,940.35.
</P>
<P>
Financial companies led the Dow's advance. Investors purchased
shares of big financial firms as relative bargains and American
Express and J.P. Morgan, which finished lower last week on fear of
high inflation, rose sharply today.
</P>
<P>
After a deep falling, the Nasdaq index turned around to finish
higher mainly because of Qualcomm's rise. The index lost as much
as 120 points early in the session.
</P>
<P>
Investors turned back to Qualcomm, cellular phone chipmaker,
for bargains after the company's shares were priced lower in
recent sessions. Qualcomm was one of the best performers in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Stock market crumbled last Friday after government data showed
inflation, labor costs and economic growth all higher than
expected for the fourth quarter. Investors feared that the data
would prompt the Federal Reserve to drastically raise rates to
ward off inflation at the next meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Exchange index fell 7.99 at 860.25 and the Russell 2000 index of

unchanged.
