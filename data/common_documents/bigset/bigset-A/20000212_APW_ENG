Indonesia's Wiranto Said Resigning
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Indonesian security minister Wiranto, accused of
responsibility for the violence in East Timor, will resign, President
Abdurrahman Wahid said. Wahid, in Bangkok for a U.N. trade meeting, said
Saturday he would meet with Wiranto after his return to Indonesia and expects
him to resign within two days. Wahid, who has been traveling outside Indonesia
for about two weeks, first called for Wiranto's resignation on Jan. 31 after an
Indonesian government investigation blamed the general for the mayhem in East
Timor last year when the territory voted to break away from Indonesia in a
U.N.-supervised ballot.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Britain resumed direct control over
Northern Ireland on Friday, stripping power from the province's new
Protestant-Catholic administration -- its best chance at self-rule -- in hopes
of preventing the coalition's collapse. But within hours of the move, the
British and Irish governments announced that the Irish Republican Army had
softened its traditional refusal to disarm. That hopeful news, following an
agonizing week of behind-the-scenes negotiations did not deter Northern Ireland
Secretary Peter Mandelson from revoking the Cabinet's substantial powers just 72
days after handing them over.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The same tail wing problem that has become the focus of
the investigation into last week's crash of an Alaska Airlines plane was found
during government-mandated inspections Friday in at least three other jetliners.
The Federal Aviation Administration ordered inspections of all MD-80 and similar
aircraft. Preliminary inspections, which affect about 1,200 planes, must be
completed by Monday, but the FAA is giving airlines 30 days to perform a more
detailed check.

Ventura Leaving Reform Party
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura, the Reform Party's marquee name
and top officeholder, cut his ties to the national organization Friday, branding
it a "hopelessly dysfunctional" group that drags down independent politicians
like him. Ventura encouraged Minnesota Reform Party officials to abandon the
organization, too, and move to reclaim the Independence Party name of the early
1990s. Ventura said he may become an independent unless an Independence Party is
formed. The Reform Party has been hampered for months by squabbling between
billionaire and founder Ross Perot's allies and Ventura supporters. They sparred
over the 2000 convention site, presidential candidates and the party's money.

long-delayed mission to vastly improve upon maps of the Earth. The six-member
crew extended a 197-foot radar antenna mast from the shuttle cargo bay. By using
two radar antennas scientists expect to obtain 3-D snapshots of Earth's terrain.
The snapshots taken are expected to be more accurate than any taken before, a

<HEADLINE> Criticism leveled against Thruway toll hike plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A plan to allow New York State Thruway tolls to
go up by as much as 3 percent each year drew a barrage of criticism at a public
forum in Rochester.
<P>
	   The Thruway Authority wants to tie future toll increases to a national
construction cost index. If the "indexed toll adjustment plan" is approved, the
first hike of 1.8 percent would begin June 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Toll increases are "a last resort - I didn't want to be the one that had to
do it," the agency's executive director, John Platt, told a group of
Rochester-area lawmakers at the first public hearing on the toll hike proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   After wrapping up an hourlong presentation Friday, Platt then took an earful
of complaints from civic and business groups and state Assemblyman David Koon, a
Rochester Democrat.
</P>
<P>
	   "Once this plan is in place, future toll increases of 3 percent or less
would not be subject to further public comment or review," Koon complained. "In
plain English, that means there will be little or no public accountability over
future toll increases - and that's wrong."
</P>
<P>
	   The Automobile Association's local chapter also argued that tying toll
increases to the Construction Cost Index - an average of construction material
and labor costs in 20 U.S. cities - "clearly diminishes the accountability of
the Thruway Authority."
</P>
<P>
	   Legislators should ensure that any extra tolls are used exclusively for
transportation needs such as maintaining roads and bridges and not "diverted to
unrelated projects" the Thruway has assumed control of in recent years, such as
the state Barge Canal system, said AAA Rochester spokesman Jim Ver Steeg.
</P>
<P>
	   Truckers are "diametrically opposed" to toll increases on what is already
"one of the most highly priced limited access highways" in the nation, piped in
Charles Goodwin, vice president of international trade and transportation at the
Rochester Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
	   Tolls were last raised in 1988 along the 641-mile Thruway, the nation's
longest toll road. The proposed hike would be used to fund about $1 billion in
improvements over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
	   Two more public hearings were scheduled in Syracuse and Albany next week.
Thruway officials plan to hold further public hearings before finalizing their
plan this spring.

<HEADLINE> AmerGen says it might pay more for Nine Mile nuclear plants  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - A Pennsylvania-based company now says it might be
willing to pay more than the $163 million it originally offered to buy the Nine
Mile Point nuclear plants.
<P>
	   The state Public Service Commission plans to reconvene settlement
negotiations Wednesday at which AmerGen Energy Co., Niagara Mohawk Power Corp.
and the plants' other owners and other interested parties will discuss the
proposed sale.
</P>
<P>
	   Those negotiations broke off Jan. 26 after the participants reached an
impasse. But in a letter calling for resumption of talks, PSC lawyer Kevin Land
said "exploratory discussions" with AmerGen during the past two weeks led
regulators to believe further talks would be fruitful.
</P>
<P>
	   "It appears to us that the potential for AmerGen to add value to the
transactions exists, and we would like to explore this possibility with the
parties," Lang wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   AmerGen officials would not discuss their bargaining position but said they
were confident they will win approval for the acquisition.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think this is a good sign," AmerGen spokesman Bill Jones said of the
renewed talks. "We're confident that in the end we'll own and operate the
plants."
</P>
<P>
	   AmerGen, a joint venture of PECO Energy and British Energy, agreed in June
to pay $163 million to acquire the 31-year-old Nine Mile Unit 1 plant and a 59
percent stake in the newer, bigger Unit 2. The two sister reactors are located
on Lake Ontario 45 miles north of Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
	   The principal sellers, Niagara Mohawk and New York State Electric &AMP; Gas,
agreed in turn to transfer their decommissioning funds to AmerGen and to buy
power from the nuclear plants at potentially above-market prices for several
years.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, Rochester Gas &AMP; Electric, a co-owner of Unit 2, matched AmerGen
in a counteroffer by exercising a legal right-of-first-refusal.
</P>
<P>
	   PSC staffers have sharply criticized the proposed deal, saying it would
leave utility ratepayers to continue paying off nuclear construction costs for
at least a decade after the plants change hands.
</P>
<P>
	   Niagara Mohawk has estimated that its ratepayers would owe $1.8 billion for
past nuclear investments not covered by the sale, plus a return on the utility's
investment that could raise the total to $3 billion or more.
</P>
<P>
	   PSC staffers grew increasingly dissatisfied with the AmerGen deal as it
became clear that other companies were interested in the Nine Mile Point plants
and they suggested that AmerGen's proposal might be rejected in favor of a
competitive auction.
</P>
<P>
	   Another likely bidder would be Entergy Corp., a New Orleans-based company
that is negotiating to buy the James A. FitzPatrick and Indian Point nuclear
plants from the New York Power Authority. FitzPatrick also is located at Nine
Mile Point. Power authority officials have said they would not sell their two
plants for less than $400 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Entergy also has brokered a tentative deal with RG&AMP;E to lease the Nine Mile
plants and operate them if RG&AMP;E succeeds in buying them.
</P>
<P>
	   A new potential buyer - Constellation Nuclear Group, a sister company to
Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. - also recently told the PSC it would be
interested in bidding on the Nine Mile plants if AmerGen's deal is rejected.

<HEADLINE> Space mapping project will help Cornell geologists studying Andes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) - The unrivaled three-dimensional map that will be
developed from the space shuttle Endeavour mission also will help unlock some of
the secrets of the Andes Mountains' geology, says a Cornell University
geologist.
<P>
	   "There are parts of the Andes that have never been topographically mapped
because of cloud cover, especially parts of the eastern side of the range," said
Bryan Isacks, chairman of Cornell's Department of Geological Sciences and
director of its Institute for the Study of the Continents. Not even satellites
have been able to penetrate the cover, Isacks said.
</P>
<P>
	   Isacks is one of six Cornell faculty members working on a 20-year-old
topography study in the Andes in collaboration with several Latin American
scientists.
</P>
<P>
	   The Endeavour lifted off Friday on a mission to map up to 80 percent of the
Earth's surface using a new high resolution radar antennae.
</P>
<P>
	   The radar will resolve details as small as 30 meters across, said an
enthusiastic Isacks. Except for limited areas, existing maps of many remote
mountainous regions such as the Andes, whether from radar or conventional
ground-based mapping, have a resolution of only about 1 kilometer, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   As important as the images are to scientists, Isacks and his colleagues are
equally interested in the raw data used to generate the detailed topographic
maps.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not just looking at a color picture of topography. That's what you
get at the end, but there's a lot of analysis before that. It will answer basic
questions about how the world works," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the Cornell work will focus on the Altiplano, a huge plateau
surrounded by higher peaks that spreads through northern Argentina, western
Bolivia and southern Peru. The two-mile high plateau is some 188 miles wide and
625 miles long that is home to Lake Titicaca, the highest navigable lake in the
world.
</P>
<P>
	   "How this thing got raised up that way is still a fairly big mystery,"
Isacks said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a general way, geologists know how the Andes mountain range formed.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the floor of the southeastern Pacific Ocean rests on a single huge
slab of the Earth's lithosphere, the outer skin comprising the crust and the
uppermost mantle, called the Nazca plate that is floating on semimolten magma.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 200 million years ago, the eastern edge of the Nazca plate began
shoving its way under the western edge of the South American plate, which makes
up the continent itself and part of the South Atlantic Ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
	   The land above was lifted and squeezed. The crust folded and began thrusting
up mountains so sharply that there is a drop of about 40,000 feet from the
western edge of the Andes to the Peru-Chile trench in the Pacific Ocean, a
distance of only 200 miles. A chain of volcanoes erupted along the mountain
range.
</P>
<P>
	   Understanding more about the region's geology might help scientists predict
and prepare for quakes and eruptions, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The new information also could provide more understanding about the
hydrology of the Amazon River system by giving scientists more information about
the topography of its upper headwaters.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will fill in huge gaping areas that we don't know about," Isacks said.

<HEADLINE> State assemblyman charged with burglarizing aide's home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   GENESEO, N.Y. (AP) - After a two-week stay in a psychiatric ward, a
state assemblyman surrendered to police and was charged with burglarizing a
female aide's home.
<P>
	   Jerry Johnson, 57, a four-term Republican whose district extends across
Livingston, Monroe and Allegany counties in western New York, was arraigned
Friday on a charge of second-degree burglary, a felony that carries a maximum
sentence of five to 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson pleaded innocent and was freed on $10,000 bail. The judge ordered
him to stay away from the woman and her husband, who live near this village 35
miles south of Rochester.
</P>
<P>
	   Flanked by relatives outside Geneseo Town Court, a solemn Johnson declined
to answer questions. But his attorney made it clear Johnson has neither
considered taking a leave of absence nor resigning from his post "at this time."
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson, who is divorced and has three daughters, was first elected in his
mostly rural district in 1992 and is up for re-election in November. He is a
ranking minority member of the mental health committee in Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   "He is on medication and we continue to receive medical care," his attorney,
John Parrinello, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson booked into Bry Lin Hospitals, a psychiatric center in Buffalo, on
Jan. 27 with the approval of Livingston County Sheriff John York, a personal
friend. York drove him to the courthouse Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation began in December when the woman, who was not identified,
told police her pocketbook had been stolen from her car. Authorities turned up
evidence that Johnson had entered her house without permission Oct. 22 and
placed a telephone call, York said, adding further charges could be filed soon.
</P>
<P>
	   "He has been treated the same as anybody else ... in a similar type of
investigation," the sheriff said. "It is very difficult. He's been a long-time
friend. But it's also been very difficult for the victim."
</P>
<P>
	   WOKR-TV in Rochester reported the woman alleged that Johnson stalked her,
made harassing phone calls and broke into her home to steal her underwear. York
declined to elaborate on the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   After serving in the U.S. Air Force, Johnson worked his way up the ranks at
Genesee and Wyoming Railroad to become president and general manager in 1977. He
began his political career in 1972, serving on the education board, as a town
councilman and then as town supervisor in the village of Nunda for seven years.

<HEADLINE> China Releases U.S. Detainee  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- An American woman who was detained by Chinese authorities for
taking a picture at a protest by the banned Falun Gong group was released and
left for the United States on Saturday, her boyfriend said.
</P>
<P>
	   After a week's detention, police put Tracy Zhao, 30, of Queens in New York
City, on a Northwest Airlines flight bound for Detroit on Saturday morning, said
Lin Chong-li, who is also from New York.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She's out of here, finally,'' Lin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Embassy declined comment, saying that because the Chinese had
allowed no consular access, officials had not obtained a privacy waiver from
Zhao.
</P>
<P>
	   Zhao, a Northwest Airlines flight attendant, was taking a picture of police
breaking up a protest by members of the Falun Gong meditation group around
midnight Feb. 4 at Tiananmen Square when police detained her.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Lin, she did not join the protest but was there to observe it
and show support. She was among at least 50 Falun Gong followers detained at the
protest, which was held as China welcomed the lunar new year. Police kicked,
punched and dragged many of the demonstrators before putting them in vans and
driving them away.
</P>
<P>
	   Zhao, who was born in Beijing, emigrated to the United States at age 20. She
had been practicing Falun Gong for about a year, according to her mother, Yan
Zuo. Zhao was visiting Beijing to celebrate the new year and to find out how
Falun Gong members in China were being treated, Yan said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chinese government banned Falun Gong in July as a menace to the public
and a threat to Communist Party control. Founded in 1992 by a former Chinese
government clerk who now lives in New York, Falun Gong attracted millions of
followers drawn to its mix of slow-motion exercises, Buddhist and Taoist
cosmology and message of moral living.
</P>
<P>
	   Protests by members persist despite a crackdown that has seen thousands sent
to labor camps and top group leaders sentenced to prison terms of up to 18
years.

    	   ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) - The unrivaled three-dimensional map that will be
developed from the space shuttle Endeavour mission also will help unlock some of
the secrets of the Andes Mountains' geology, says a Cornell University
geologist.
<P>
	   "There are parts of the Andes that have never been topographically mapped
because of cloud cover, especially parts of the eastern side of the range," said
Bryan Isacks, chairman of Cornell's Department of Geological Sciences and
director of its Institute for the Study of the Continents. Not even satellites
have been able to penetrate the cover, Isacks said.
</P>
<P>
	   Isacks is one of six Cornell faculty members working on a 20-year-old
topography study in the Andes in collaboration with several Latin American
scientists.
</P>
<P>
	   The Endeavour lifted off Friday on a mission to map up to 80 percent of the
Earth's surface using a new high resolution radar antennae.
</P>
<P>
	   The radar will resolve details as small as 30 meters across, said an
enthusiastic Isacks. Except for limited areas, existing maps of many remote
mountainous regions such as the Andes, whether from radar or conventional
ground-based mapping, have a resolution of only about 1 kilometer, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   As important as the images are to scientists, Isacks and his colleagues are
equally interested in the raw data used to generate the detailed topographic
maps.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not just looking at a color picture of topography. That's what you
get at the end, but there's a lot of analysis before that. It will answer basic
questions about how the world works," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the Cornell work will focus on the Altiplano, a huge plateau
surrounded by higher peaks that spreads through northern Argentina, western
Bolivia and southern Peru. The two-mile high plateau is some 188 miles wide and
625 miles long that is home to Lake Titicaca, the highest navigable lake in the
world.
</P>
<P>
	   "How this thing got raised up that way is still a fairly big mystery,"
Isacks said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a general way, geologists know how the Andes mountain range formed.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the floor of the southeastern Pacific Ocean rests on a single huge
slab of the Earth's lithosphere, the outer skin comprising the crust and the
uppermost mantle, called the Nazca plate that is floating on semimolten magma.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 200 million years ago, the eastern edge of the Nazca plate began
shoving its way under the western edge of the South American plate, which makes
up the continent itself and part of the South Atlantic Ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
	   The land above was lifted and squeezed. The crust folded and began thrusting
up mountains so sharply that there is a drop of about 40,000 feet from the
western edge of the Andes to the Peru-Chile trench in the Pacific Ocean, a
distance of only 200 miles. A chain of volcanoes erupted along the mountain
range.
</P>
<P>
	   Understanding more about the region's geology might help scientists predict
and prepare for quakes and eruptions, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The new information also could provide more understanding about the
hydrology of the Amazon River system by giving scientists more information about
the topography of its upper headwaters.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will fill in huge gaping areas that we don't know about," Isacks said.

<HEADLINE> State assemblyman charged with burglarizing aide's home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   GENESEO, N.Y. (AP) - After a two-week stay in a psychiatric ward, a
state assemblyman surrendered to police and was charged with burglarizing a
female aide's home.
<P>
	   Jerry Johnson, 57, a four-term Republican whose district extends across
Livingston, Monroe and Allegany counties in western New York, was arraigned
Friday on a charge of second-degree burglary, a felony that carries a maximum
sentence of five to 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson pleaded innocent and was freed on $10,000 bail. The judge ordered
him to stay away from the woman and her husband, who live near this village 35
miles south of Rochester.
</P>
<P>
	   Flanked by relatives outside Geneseo Town Court, a solemn Johnson declined
to answer questions. But his attorney made it clear Johnson has neither
considered taking a leave of absence nor resigning from his post "at this time."
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson, who is divorced and has three daughters, was first elected in his
mostly rural district in 1992 and is up for re-election in November. He is a
ranking minority member of the mental health committee in Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   "He is on medication and we continue to receive medical care," his attorney,
John Parrinello, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson booked into Bry Lin Hospitals, a psychiatric center in Buffalo, on
Jan. 27 with the approval of Livingston County Sheriff John York, a personal
friend. York drove him to the courthouse Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation began in December when the woman, who was not identified,
told police her pocketbook had been stolen from her car. Authorities turned up
evidence that Johnson had entered her house without permission Oct. 22 and
placed a telephone call, York said, adding further charges could be filed soon.
</P>
<P>
	   "He has been treated the same as anybody else ... in a similar type of
investigation," the sheriff said. "It is very difficult. He's been a long-time
friend. But it's also been very difficult for the victim."
</P>
<P>
	   WOKR-TV in Rochester reported the woman alleged that Johnson stalked her,
made harassing phone calls and broke into her home to steal her underwear. York
declined to elaborate on the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   After serving in the U.S. Air Force, Johnson worked his way up the ranks at
Genesee and Wyoming Railroad to become president and general manager in 1977. He
began his political career in 1972, serving on the education board, as a town
councilman and then as town supervisor in the village of Nunda for seven years.

<HEADLINE> Midwest Express Strike Threat Looms  </HEADLINE>
    By SHAUN TANDON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Midwest Express Airlines canceled more than a dozen
weekend flights and pilots picketed Friday as negotiators worked passed their
initial deadline to reach a contract to avoid a strike.
</P>
<P>
	   The Air Line Pilots Association was reviewing a comprehensive offer from
management late Friday and extended the deadline for negotiations until 1 a.m.
CST Saturday, said union spokesman Paul Omodt.
</P>
<P>
	   The original deadline was 11:01 p.m. CST Friday, but Omodt said the union
received the airline's offer 15 minutes before the deadline and wanted time to
review it.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the Midwest Express Center in downtown Milwaukee, about 30 of the
airline's 320 pilots held an informational picket, marching in a circle with
signs reading, "Contract or strike on February 12."
</P>
<P>
	   The union held a similar protest Friday at Mitchell International Airport,
the airline's hub. Midwest Express has 130 daily flights to 31 cities, including
Boston, Los Angeles, New York and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
	   The Air Line Pilots Association has been negotiating with Midwest Express
for 19 months to establish a contract -- the first between the two.
</P>
<P>
	   "The pilots are determined to get a contract and they want to support their
negotiating committee," said Omodt.
</P>
<P>
	   In preparation for the strike, the airline canceled 15 flights scheduled for
Friday evening and Saturday morning. The 200 affected passengers were put on
other flights, said airline spokeswoman Lisa Bailey. A decision on flights later
Saturday and Sunday had not been made, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Mediation Board, which was holding talks between the union and
the airline in Washington, asked both sides not to discuss the negotiations
publicly.
</P>
<P>
	   According to fliers the demonstrating pilots passed out, final talks hinge
on wages, and pension and health insurance for retirees.
</P>
<P>
	   The union says the average salary for a five-year veteran pilot at Midwest
Express is $86,000, compared with an industry average of $145,000.
</P>
<P>
	   As for retirement benefits, the union says the airline would give retirees
less than 40 percent of their preretirement income, compared to 58 percent at
comparable airlines. The union also wants the airline to guarantee insurance for
retired pilots.
</P>
<P>
	   Bailey declined comment Friday on the union's statements because of the news
blackout.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline said in the event of a strike, passengers would either be put on
other carriers, receive full refunds for their tickets or be allowed to book
tickets on future Midwest Express flights.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not too concerned today. My larger concern is getting back," said Peter
Voss of Milwaukee, who left Friday for a week in New York. "But if there's a
strike, I'm sure the airline will put us on comparable flights."

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Wiranto Said Resigning  </HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK MCDOWELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Indonesian Security Minister Wiranto, accused of
allowing pro-Indonesia militias to devastate East Timor, will resign next week,
the country's president said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   President Abdurrahman Wahid, in Bangkok for a U.N. trade meeting, said he
would meet with Wiranto after his return to Indonesia Saturday night and expects
him to resign within two days.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid, who has been traveling outside Indonesia for about two weeks, first
called for Wiranto's resignation on Jan. 31 after an Indonesian government
investigation blamed the general for the mayhem in East Timor last year when the
territory voted to break away from Indonesia in a U.N.-supervised ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, has refused to budge
from his Cabinet position, sparking fears of a coup attempt by the country's
powerful military.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid said Wiranto had not resigned already because the two had not had a
chance to meet face to face.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can expect the day after tomorrow, the announcement of his
resignation,'' Wahid said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Jakarta, an aide to Wiranto refused to comment on Wahid's comments.
</P>
<P>
	   Any agreement for Wiranto to step down is expected to provide a safe exit
for him, while establishing Wahid's authority over the once all-powerful
military.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid had asked the general to quit the Cabinet over the recent bloodshed
and devastation in East Timor. However, Wahid also recently suggested he might
pardon Wiranto if he were convicted of human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
	   Such a trade-off could protect Indonesia's fragile democracy after decades
of authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked why he believed Wiranto would resign, Wahid said: ``Because of his
sense of patriotism, his sense of loyalty to the country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid said he understood that Wiranto was concerned that he would have to
face questions in a court, and that his resignation might be seen as an
acknowledgement of guilt.
</P>
<P>
	   But he said it would be better for Indonesia if Wiranto steps down because
it would be sign that the country is serious about democratic reforms and
restoring stability.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His resignation will be seen by other countries as a sign we are serious,
that you can invest in Indonesia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto has continued to attend Cabinet meetings despite Wahid's calls for
him to resign.
</P>
<P>
	   But in an interview published Friday in Singapore's Straits Times newspaper,
Wiranto said Indonesia's military is loyal to the president and will not stage a
coup.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It never crossed my mind to seize power,'' Wiranto was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   When Wahid's foreign trip ends, he will have visited 18 cities in 16 days.
He had wanted to recruit foreign investment for his country, the world's
fourth-most populous nation, after its worst economic crisis in a generation.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, his trip was dominated by Indonesian government and U.N. reports
that accuse Wiranto's troops of backing militia gangs that terrorized East Timor
after its people voted overwhelming to end Indonesian rule last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto was military commander at the time, but denies responsibility for
the violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid said repeatedly while visiting European and Asian capitals that if
Wiranto refused to quit, he would be fired. Back in Jakarta, Wiranto defiantly
took part in Cabinet meetings.
</P>
<P>
	   A showdown previously seemed inevitable. But in recent days, Wahid has
tempered his resignation demands by praising Wiranto as an honest soldier who
had once thwarted a plot to murder him.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid took office last October as its first freely elected president in 44
years. Since taking office, he has reined in the power of the military by
replacing Wiranto as armed forces commander and insisting that he and other
generals in the Cabinet become civilians.

<HEADLINE> Kings 3, Stars 2  </HEADLINE>
    By KEN PETERS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jozef Stumpel had a goal and an assist Friday night as
the Los Angeles Kings ended a 22-game winless drought against Dallas with a 3-2
victory that also snapped the Stars' 11-game winning streak against them.
</P>
<P>
	   Los Angeles hadn't beaten Dallas since a 3-2 victory on April 6, 1995,
losing 16 and tying six during that stretch.
</P>
<P>
	   Stumpel put the Kings in front to stay when he scored 7:12 into the opening
period. After Dallas closed to 2-1 early in the second period, Stumpel assisted
on Luc Robitaille's goal that beat the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
	   Robitaille's 26th goal came after a scramble in front of the Stars' net that
left Dallas goalie Ed Belfour sprawling, tangled up with Los Angeles' Rob Blake.
</P>
<P>
	   Aaron Gavey had a goal and an assist for Dallas.
</P>
<P>
	   After the Kings went up 3-1, defenseman Richard Matvichuk trimmed the
deficit to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
	   Gavey set up the goal, taking advantage when Los Angeles goalie Jamie Storr
got caught out of position, trying to clear the puck from behind the net. Gavey
picked up the puck behind the goal line, tried a wraparound that bounced off the
goal post and slid it to Matvichuk.
</P>
<P>
	   The Stars pulled to 2-1 on Gavey's second goal of the season, 5:55 into the
second period. The score was set up by Jamie Wright, who skated behind the goal
and threaded a pass between defenders to Gavey, who beat Storr from 15 feet.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Galley put Los Angeles up 2-0 with 5:15 left in the opening period.
Skating alone down the crease, Galley took a pass from Jason Blake on the right
wing and beat Belfour from close range for his seventh goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Stumpel opened the scoring by finishing off a give-and-go with Ziggy Palffy.
The pair skated down 2-on-2 with Dallas defenders, and Stumpel got behind Mike
Keane as Keane converged on Palffy. Palffy passed to Stumpel near the left post
and Stumpel chipped in his shot to run his goal-scoring streak to five games.
</P>
<P>
	   The 11 consecutive victories over the Kings tied the Stars' record against
any NHL foe. The team also won 11 straight against Los Angeles from Feb. 24,
1971, through Nov. 25, 1973, while the franchise was still the Minnesota North
Stars. The 22-game unbeaten streak against the Kings also was the longest in the
Stars' history against any club.
</P>
<P>
	   The longest unbeaten streak in NHL history against one team is Montreal's
31-0-3 record against Washington from 1974-79.

<HEADLINE> No. 12 UC S. Barbara 69, Pacific 59  </HEADLINE>
    By DENNIS GEORGATOS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STOCKTON, Calif. (AP) -- Kristi Rohr scored 20 points and had 12 rebounds as
No. 12 UC Santa Barbara extended its winning streak to 16 by defeating Pacific
69-59 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Stacy Clinesmith added 13 points and Erin Buescher 12 for the Gauchos (20-3,
8-0 Big West), winners of at least 20 games for the fifth straight season.
Buescher scored in double figures for the 65th straight game despite foul
trouble that limited her to 23 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Santa Barbara hasn't lost in more than two months.
</P>
<P>
	   Selena Ho's 19 points led Pacific (12-8, 3-5), which lost for the fifth time
in seven games. Millie Kimpton added 15 points and Asha Johnson had 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Down by 13 at the break, Pacific started the second half with consecutive
layups by Ho and Johnson but the Gauchos then scored 18 of the next 23 points to
move in front 45-28. Rohr scored six straight points to fuel the surge and
Clinesmith capped it with a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
	   Pacific managed to pull within 47-34 on Johnson's driving layup but then in
quick succession Tawnee Cooper hit a 3-pointer and Rohr made a baseline jumper
to give the Gauchos an 18-point lead with just over 10 minutes left.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tigers made one last push with a 10-0 run near the end of the game but
Gauchos had enough of a cushion to withstand the late rally.
</P>
<P>
	   Santa Barbara led 32-19 at halftime even though Buescher played for just six
minutes after picking up two quick fouls. She finished with four.
</P>
<P>
	   Pacific couldn't take advantage of Buescher's absence because of poor
shooting. The Tigers converted just 19 percent of their shots in the period
(7-for-36), including 2-for-13 from behind the 3-point line.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gauchos took nine fewer shots but did a better job of making them,
alternating between driving to the basket and pulling up for outside shots. They
made 3-of-4 from beyond the arc, including two by Jess Hansen.
</P>
<P>
	   For the game, Pacific made 31 percent of its field goals while the Gauchos
converted 46 percent.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Britain resumed direct control over
Northern Ireland on Friday, stripping power from the province's new

of preventing the coalition's collapse. But within hours of the move, the
British and Irish governments announced that the Irish Republican Army had

like him. Ventura encouraged Minnesota Reform Party officials to abandon the
organization, too, and move to reclaim the Independence Party name of the early
1990s. Ventura said he may become an independent unless an Independence Party is
formed. The Reform Party has been hampered for months by squabbling between
billionaire and founder Ross Perot's allies and Ventura supporters. They sparred
over the 2000 convention site, presidential candidates and the party's money.

	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Endeavour launched Friday on a
long-delayed mission to vastly improve upon maps of the Earth. The six-member
crew extended a 197-foot radar antenna mast from the shuttle cargo bay. By using
two radar antennas scientists expect to obtain 3-D snapshots of Earth's terrain.
The snapshots taken are expected to be more accurate than any taken before, a
boon not only to the Pentagon but to environmentalists, airlines and emergency
relief groups.

<HEADLINE> Nursing Home Aide Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALEM, Mass. (AP) -- A former nursing home aide who raped and impregnated a
comatose patient has been sentenced to 11 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel Moret pleaded guilty to rape and abusing a patient in a long-term
care facility. The woman later gave birth prematurely to a baby who suffered
severe brain damage. The baby needs round-the-clock care just as her mother
does.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our family now has a second broken child because of what he did,'' the
victim's sister said Friday in court. ``He has sentenced our family to sorrow
for life. Our hearts sink when we hold her, hear the machines that keep her
alive, and anticipate her future.''
</P>
<P>
	   The victim was a 24-year-old resident of Town Manor Nursing and
Rehabilitation Center in Lawrence when her pregnancy was discovered in October
1998. Police used DNA analysis to identify Moret as the father.
</P>
<P>
	   Moret's lawyer, Lawrence McGuire, said his client wanted to apologize to the
victim's family.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He has also told me to tell this court and all who will listen that he
expects to do what he can for this child,'' McGuire said.

   PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- Episcopalians in North Carolina have made their
diocese the first in the South to elect a black bishop, choosing a Baltimore
minister to lead their 33,000 members.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Michael Curry was elected Friday from among six candidates at the
annual convention of the Episcopal Diocese of North Carolina. He will be
installed June 17, replacing the Rt. Rev. Robert Johnson Jr., who is retiring.
</P>
<P>
	   About 40 of the 500 delegates were black.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is both a joyous and a humbling experience,'' Curry said. ``I'm very
grateful and very thankful, and really looking forward to being part of the life
of the church in North Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
	   Curry will oversee 250 pastors, confirm new members and participate in a
rulemaking body within the national denomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Blacks have served in Southern dioceses as suffragan bishops, essentially
assistant bishops, but never as bishop. Curry, who has led the St. James Church
in Baltimore for 11 years, is considered moderate to liberal.

<HEADLINE> Methodists Drop Gay Wedding Case  </HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER COLEMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The United Methodist church has decided not to
bring charges against 68 ministers who blessed a lesbian wedding to protest
their church's ban on gay marriages.
</P>
<P>
	   Church investigators decided Friday that the charges were not serious enough
to merit a trial under United Methodist law. If the pastors had been convicted
of breaking church law, they could have faced punishment as severe as dismissal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No further steps or actions will be pursued,'' said Bishop Melvin Talbert
of the church's California-Northern Nevada Conference. He acknowledged, however:
``This decision will not resolve the tension within the community.''
</P>
<P>
	   The lead defendant was the Rev. Don Fado of St. Mark's United Methodist
Church in Sacramento, who performed the January 1999 wedding of church members
Ellie Charlton, 64, and Jeanne Barnett, 69.
</P>
<P>
	   Fado said he had been willing to go to trial if it would ``knock down a
barrier in someone's ministry,'' but was relieved by the decision.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've got other things to do with our money than bring our own to trial
for an act of conscience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The ceremony was attended by 1,500 guests and a total of 92 Methodist
ministers. Only 68 were named in a formal complaint because the rest were
outside the jurisdiction of the California-Northern Nevada Conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Fado compared the ceremony to an act of civil disobedience, which his church
has supported for civil rights and anti-war causes, and said he sought a church
trial to force the church to face the needs of gay members.
</P>
<P>
	   At a hearing before seven church investigators last week, Charlton said that
before the wedding ceremony, she and Barnett lived in two social groups, the gay
community and the church, that viewed each other with suspicion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now we share our church life with the gay community and share our gay life
with the church,'' she told the panel. ``It was very stressful being in two
different closets. Now we're not in any closet.''
</P>
<P>
	   The decision not to pursue charges Friday drew an immediate protest from the
Rev. Greg Smith of the Hope United Methodist Church in Sacramento. Smith said he
is considering the leaving the church.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today's decision effectively ended the rule of discipline,'' Smith said.
``We now follow our own individual conscience as far as I can see.''
</P>
<P>
	   Smith said he would ask the Methodists' national ruling body to affirm its
ban on gay marriages and make it clear that ministers who disobey it will be
punished, or to let those who disagree with Friday's ruling leave the church
with dignity.

<HEADLINE> Regent University Studies Hip-Hop  </HEADLINE>
   By SONJA BARISIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) -- Evangelical Christians are getting an earful of
rap music this weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Regent University, founded by religious broadcaster Pat Robertson, is
sponsoring a conference on ``The Hip-Hop Nation'' to try to help adults
understand urban youth culture and its appeal to teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Churches don't get the rap thing,'' the Rev. Eugene Rivers III, the
conference's featured speaker, said Friday. ``They still don't get rock 'n' roll
50 years later. They still don't get Elvis Presley.''
</P>
<P>
	   If evangelical Christians want to understand and communicate with their
teens, they must try to understand hip-hop, said Rivers, founder of Boston's Ten
Point Coalition, which works to reduce youth violence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Rap and hip-hop are the voices of the post-civil rights generation, for
kids black and white,'' Rivers said.
</P>
<P>
	   About 100 people attended the conference's opening session Thursday night.
The conference ends today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're interested in how faith and culture interact,'' said organizer
Benson Fraser, who is teaching a class on hip-hop culture this semester. ``We
feel faith can help shape culture but often doesn't, especially in the arts.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rivers said churches mistakenly condemn some hip-hop music as obscene
without understanding the reasons behind the lyrics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Obscene lyrics are in more cases than not a product of obscene
circumstances,'' Rivers said. ``If I'm going to decry the obscenity of the
lyrics ... I must decry as vigorously the obscene conditions which provoked the
lyrics,'' such as poverty.

<HEADLINE> Coach Landry's Condition Worsens  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DALLAS (AP) -- Former Dallas Cowboys coach Tom Landry has taken a turn for
the worse in his battle against leukemia, his son said.
</P>
<P>
	   "While the results of my father's latest chemotherapy treatments were at
first encouraging, it is now apparent that the leukemia has returned," Tom
Landry Jr. said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Aided by the efforts of doctors and nurses, dad has been battling this
disease for the last nine months. He is resting comfortably in a private room at
Baylor University Medical Center, surrounded by his family," Landry's son told
The Dallas Morning News.
</P>
<P>
	   "Although he can't receive visitors or flowers, the family wishes to thank
everyone for their continuing prayers and concerns."
</P>
<P>
	   Landry, 75, was diagnosed in May with acute myelogenous leukemia. He has
been in and out of Baylor University Medical Center and has undergone
chemotherapy treatments.
</P>
<P>
	   He was released Nov. 21, but was readmitted last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Landry coached the Cowboys for 29 seasons, beginning with their first season
in 1960. He is third on the NFL's career victory list with a 270-178-6 record.
His teams won two Super Bowls and 13 division titles and had an unprecedented 20
consecutive winning seasons from 1966 to 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Pilots Punished for Refusing Vaccine  </HEADLINE>
   By AMY FORLITI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- At least a dozen Indiana Air National Guard pilots in
Fort Wayne are barred from flying for refusing an anthrax vaccination required
for an upcoming mission overseas, pilots say.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the 122nd Fighter Wing, which is scheduled to be sent to the
Middle East in April, have until Sunday to begin the series of six shots. The
vaccination program had been voluntary until now.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everybody is worried about safety,'' said Capt. Bruce Everett, a
commercial pilot barred from flying for the Guard in January for refusing the
vaccine. ``I don't know if it's unsafe. All I know is that there hasn't been
enough research to prove that it is safe.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon has ordered all of its 2.4 million active and reserve personnel
be inoculated against anthrax, a deadly germ that can be used in biological
warfare.
</P>
<P>
	   About 200 to 300 people have refused the vaccine so far, according to the
Pentagon. Several men and women have been prosecuted, and many reservists have
quit because of the shots.
</P>
<P>
	   Twelve pilots now barred from flying at Fort Wayne plan to resign or
transfer to avoid inoculation, said Everett, Lt. Col. Tom Heemstra and two other
pilots who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Col. Perry Collins, chief of staff of the 122nd Fighter Wing, confirmed
only that some pilots are not being allowed to fly. He said squadron commanders
do not want to spend money training the pilots until they decide to stay with
the base.
</P>
<P>
	   The Guard said those who refuse to take the vaccine by Sunday's deadline
will be disobeying a written order and could face additional penalties,
including discharge.

<HEADLINE> Man Won't Sell Condoms, Loses Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A jury has rejected a federal discrimination lawsuit brought by
an Orthodox Jewish pharmacist who was denied a job at a drugstore because he
wouldn't sell condoms.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue before the jury was whether Eckerd Corp. knew about Hillel
Hellinger's religious beliefs and failed to make a reasonable accommodation for
him. The jury decided in Eckerd's favor Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Eckerd had said that there was no way to reasonably accommodate Hellinger's
wishes without hurting customer service.
</P>
<P>
	   Hellinger, a 41-year-old Hasidic Jew with nine children, had sought
unspecified damages for mental anguish, $100,000 in back wages and the part-time
job he didn't get in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   He testified that his only restrictions were against working on the Sabbath
and selling condoms because of a Jewish law against wasting semen.
</P>
<P>
	   Eckerd attorney Susan Dolin said Hellinger exaggerated his beliefs and
twisted anti-discrimination law. She said Eckerd has hired other Orthodox Jews
as pharmacists.
</P>
<P>
	   Hellinger reached confidential settlements of similar claims against the
Rite Aid and Walgreen drugstore chains. He acknowledged selling condoms while
with Rite Aid. Eckerd has about 2,900 drugstores in 20 states.

<HEADLINE> Preliminary Date Set for Nichols  </HEADLINE>
   By TIM TALLEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- A preliminary hearing to decide whether Oklahoma City
bombing conspirator Terry Nichols will stand trial on state murder charges will
begin Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Associate District Judge Robert Murphy Jr. set the date Friday during a
contentious hearing for Nichols, 44, where prosecution and defense attorneys
bickered about everything from the cost of copying documents to how to address
Nichols in court.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorney Brian Hermanson said he cannot be ready in time for the
preliminary hearing. He said there are approximately 2 million documents
involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Murphy also took under advisement a motion filed by prosecutors to enforce a
county court rule directing defense attorneys to address Nichols as ``the
accused'' or ``the defendant'' in court instead of ``Terry.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nichols was brought to Oklahoma City on Jan. 31 from Colorado, where he was
serving a life prison sentence after being convicted of federal charges of
conspiracy and eight counts of involuntary manslaughter in the deaths of eight
federal law enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
	   The April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building killed
168 people and injured hundreds more.
</P>
<P>
	   Nichols is charged in Oklahoma with 160 counts of first-degree murder for
the deaths of victims other than the eight federal agents. He could be sentenced
to death if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   Bombing co-conspirator Timothy McVeigh was convicted of murder at his
federal trial and sentenced to death.

<HEADLINE> Millionaire: Is it Too Easy to Win?  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Just how hard are the questions on "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire" anyway?
</P>
<P>
	   "They're only easy if you know them," said John Carpenter, the Connecticut
man who last November became the first of two million-dollar winners on ABC's
hit game show.
</P>
<P>
	   The British insurer responsible for paying out the show's top prizes
disagrees. Goshawk Syndicate filed suit in Britain's High Court of Justice to
get out of its contract, worried it would have to pay too much unless the show
asks harder questions and selects dumber contestants.
</P>
<P>
	   "Millionaire" host Regis Philbin said the company was "chicken."
</P>
<P>
	   "Can you believe this?" Philbin said on "Live with Regis &AMP; Kathie Lee"
Friday. "This is what insurance is all about. It's a risk. You can't take the
risk, don't insure the show to begin with."
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Davies, executive producer of "Millionaire," declined to talk about
the lawsuit on Friday. But last month, he vigorously defended the show's
questions.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have to answer every single question," he said. "The questions might be
easy within their category, but there is such a broad range, it is almost
impossible for anybody on a regular basis to be able to go through all the
questions in any given stack."
</P>
<P>
	   To win $1 million, a contestant must answer 15 multiple-choice questions in
a row correctly.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's much easier to play the game sitting in an easy chair at home than
sitting across from Regis in the studio," said Doug Van Gundy, a West Virginia
man who won $250,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The multiple-choice questions are frequently easy in the early rounds. They
get harder as the stakes grow higher.
</P>
<P>
	   Goshawk's policy required it to pay prizes of $500,000 or $1 million.
Goshawk's responsibility didn't kick in until a $1.5 million deductible was met,
and there was a ceiling of $5 million. The "Millionaire" production company,
Buena Vista Entertainment Inc., was responsible for all smaller prizes.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of the game shows that were rushed onto the air in the wake of ABC's
success, Fox's "Greed" and NBC's "Twenty-One," don't have outside insurers.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox looked into a policy but determined it was too expensive and decided to
pay the prize money itself, said Mike Darnell, executive vice president of
alternative programming at Fox.
</P>
<P>
	   An insurance policy is common for contests, including game shows, where big
prize money is offered, said Steve Goldstein, a spokesman for the Insurance
Information Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sometimes it takes some of the allure away," Goldstein said. "Part of the
reason people like the show is that they believe the network is paying out the
money. I did have people say to me, 'I didn't know they had insurance."'

<HEADLINE> New MRI Scans Reveal Strokes  </HEADLINE>
    By DANIEL Q. HANEY AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A souped-up scanner is giving doctors a clear new view
into the brain, revealing strokes that are missed three-quarters of the time by
older machines.
</P>
<P>
	   The device can pinpoint spots of dying tissue deep within the brain during
the first hours of a stroke, when a blood clot somewhere in the head is choking
off the oxygen supply.
</P>
<P>
	   Until recently, diagnosing strokes was a leisurely affair, since doctors
could do almost nothing for them. That changed about three years ago when they
learned the clot-dissolving medicine TPA can reverse a stroke, just as it does a
heart attack, if given within the first few hours of symptoms.
</P>
<P>
	   Suddenly, doctors want better tools to make on-the-spot decisions about
care. This made the new MRI machines a major topic of discussion Friday at a
meeting of the American Stroke Association.
</P>
<P>
	   "The question is, is it really worth the effort?" said Dr. David Tong of
Stanford University. "There is no doubt you can see a lot more stuff. But does
seeing all that actually make a difference?"
</P>
<P>
	   The answer from Tong's research and other work at the conference seems to be
yes. They say the new machines, while expensive, offer information that helps
doctors make more intelligent decisions for victims of strokes, which hit an
estimated 700,000 Americans annually and are the nation's No. 3 killer.
</P>
<P>
	   The new technology comes in two varieties: Diffusion-weighted imaging shows
exactly which brain tissue is already dead. Perfusion-weighted imaging shows the
parts of the brain that are still alive but starved of blood. Both work by
measuring how easily water flows through the brain.
</P>
<P>
	   Standard magnetic resonance imaging machines that many hospitals already own
can be upgraded to take the new scans for about $500,000. New MRIs now come with
the new capabilities built in, and they cost between $1 million and $3 million.
The pictures themselves take just a few minutes and cost the same as ordinary
MRI scans, about $1,000 to $1,500.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hospitals are getting this technology as they upgrade their scanners,"
which they do about very five years, said Dr. Alison Elizabeth Baird of Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Candice Perkins of Syracuse University-New York Stony Brook reviewed the
results of the new scans on 118 stroke patients. During the critical first six
hours, the scans revealed strokes that would have been missed three-quarters of
the time by CT scans, now the standard method of checking stroke patients.
</P>
<P>
	   Many strokes are apparent by symptoms alone, such as paralysis and slurred
speech, and doctors use this to guide treatment. But Perkins said the new scans
have prompted doctors to give TPA when otherwise they would not.
</P>
<P>
	   Strokes are more likely to show up on CT scans as time passes. However,
Perkins' work found that even a day later, one-third of strokes can be seen only
on the new MRI scans.
</P>
<P>
	   Tong looked at how the new scans affected treatment decisions at the
Stanford Stroke Center. He reviewed 39 cases and found that in one-third, the
new information prompted major changes in the way they were treated. The scans
were especially useful in revealing strokes that arise from blood clots
originating in the heart, since these strokes are treated with different drugs
than other kinds of strokes.
</P>
<P>
	   Ordinarily, doctors give CT scans first before administering TPA. The CT
scans are necessary to show whether strokes might actually result from broken
blood vessels inside the head. Giving TPA to such patients makes their condition
worse, not better.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Gottfried Schlaug, also of Boston's Beth Israel, said the new machines
have allowed his hospital to abandon this routine CT scanning, since the MRIs
can accurately reveal bleeding.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Looks to Social Security  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation to lift the outside earnings limit on Social
Security for people aged 65 to 70 is the next priority for House Republicans,
Speaker Dennis Hastert says.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The time has come to give our working seniors a break,'' the Illinois
Republican said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Current law penalizes thousands of senior citizens by $1 in Social Security
benefits for every $3 they earn over $17,000. Thousands of others are
discouraged from working or work only part of the year to avoid the cap,
advocates for the elderly say.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They don't understand why we have a public policy that takes away all of
their extra money,'' said John Rother, director of public policy for AARP.
</P>
<P>
	   GOP leaders are working on a bill to repeal or at least greatly raise the
limit. A repeal bill introduced by Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas, would cost roughly
$24 billion over 10 years, which would come from the projected budget surplus,
congressional aides said.
</P>
<P>
	   A House Ways and Means subcommittee on Social Security is scheduled to hold
a hearing on the issue Tuesday. Its chairman, Rep. E. Clay Shaw, R-Fla.,
estimated that 400,000 working older Americans are affected each year.
</P>
<P>
	   Like the 10-year, $182 billion tax cut the House passed this week for
married couples, ending the Social Security earnings limit is popular among
Democrats and Republicans. It also appeals to the key elderly constituency, one
of the main voter battlegrounds as the two parties wrestle for control of the
House in this year's elections.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton has spoken frequently about the need to eliminate the
earnings limit, but White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the president would
not endorse a ``piecemeal'' approach to Social Security, which faces insolvency
as the baby boom generation retires.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not going to have a debate about Social Security that doesn't
involve solvency,'' Lockhart said. ``That is where this debate starts, and
that's where the debate ends, as far as we're concerned.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Democrats on Capitol Hill watched a fourth of their number join majority
Republicans to send the GOP's 10-year, $182 billion ``marriage penalty'' tax cut
to the Senate. They don't look forward to another fight over an issue many of
them are on record as supporting.
</P>
<P>
	   A Democratic aide said while the party must be careful to avoid ignoring the
White House, the faithful will work to find an acceptable alternative to the GOP
bill.
</P>
<P>
	   The earnings limit, which ends after a person reaches age 70, is scheduled
under current law to rise to $25,000 in 2001 and to $30,000 in 2002, where it
will remain unless changes are made. The GOP also is eyeing for action a
separate earnings test that reduces Social Security benefits by $1 for every $2
of income above $10,080 for people under age 65.

<HEADLINE> Forgotten Painter Gets Major Show  </HEADLINE>
   By CARL HARTMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An exhibit of 74 paintings by a 19th-century artist who
was nearly forgotten until World War II opens Sunday at the National Gallery of
Art.
</P>
<P>
	   Gallery officials say the landscapes, thunderstorms, seascapes, hummingbirds
and sensuous magnolia flowers of Martin Johnson Heade may be the most varied
body of work of any American of his time.
</P>
<P>
	   Heade painted the portraits and landscapes salable in his day but preferred
salt marshes and thunderstorms. When that wasn't too successful he went back to
a boyhood love -- hummingbirds -- winning recognition from the emperor of
Brazil, a land considered the paradise of hummingbirds.
</P>
<P>
	   Heade died in 1904 at age 85 while painting under the patronage of Henry
Morrison Flagler, a rich Standard Oil. Heade was a celebrity in St. Augustine,
Fla. at the time of his death.
</P>
<P>
	   But after Heade passed away, his work was little remembered until one of his
looming thunderstorms made a sensation at the Museum of Modern Art in New York
in 1943.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His paintings keep turning up,'' said Franklin Kelly, the gallery's
curator of American and British paintings. ``It's worthwhile keeping an eye out
in junk shops.''
</P>
<P>
	   The painting that caused the sensation, ``Thunder Storm on Naragansett
Bay,'' was found by two dealers in an antique shop in Larchmont, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   Born on a Bucks County, Pa. farm, Heade called himself a ``monomaniac''
about hummingbirds. During the Civil War he took a boat to Rio de Janeiro.
Brazilian Emperor Pedro II shared his love for the birds and told him what hill
to climb to get the best view of the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Heade recorded the view and then went back to the hummingbirds. He painted
them fighting, feeding, courting, guarding a nest, reveling in the multiplicity
of varieties, much more numerous than at home.
</P>
<P>
	   He liked contrasting the tiny birds' brilliant colors with equally brilliant
blossoms -- orchids, passion flowers, Cherokee roses.
</P>
<P>
	   One enthusiastic critic compared Heade's sensual giant magnolias to
odalisques -- women slaves or concubines in a harem.
</P>
<P>
	   Heade studied in Rome and had some success as a painter in Britain, though
he failed to get enough support for a project of an album on hummingbirds. He
lived in many U.S. cities, where he cultivated local dealers who provided him
with a market when he had only moderate success in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, Heade did an impressive portrait of the Texan hero, Gen.
Samuel Houston. It now hangs in the Governor's Mansion in Austin.
</P>
<P>
	   Heade settled in St. Augustine and married at 64. Later the couple moved
into a small studio building that Flagler built behind his Ponce de Leon Hotel,
where they lived for the rest of Heade's life.
</P>
<P>
	   He did two of his biggest paintings for the hotel for $2,000 each, a large
sum for art at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ``Martin Johnson Heade'' will be at the National Gallery of Art through
March 7, and at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, May 29-Aug. 17.

<HEADLINE> Congressional Notebook: Elections  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- First the House Republicans, then Democrats, decamped
from Washington for brief retreats recently, and both sides came back saying
they were encouraged by election-season reports from their pollsters.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican survey reported that that a hypothetical GOP candidate
outpolled a hypothetical Democratic candidate, 41-36, with 23 percent undecided,
in a poll taken in 41 key, targeted congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans were urged to stick to an agenda with four main points: Social
Security, education, a flexible spending freeze with attention paid to
eliminating government waste and tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic poll, by contrast, had Democrats at 38 percent and
Republicans at 33 percent, with 29 percent undecided, in a survey taken in 35
targeted districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats also were cheered by the finding that among the 29 percent
undecided on the so-called generic ballot test, the issues that mattered most
were education, Social Security and health care, favorable terrain for their
party.
</P>
<P>
	   The two parties in the House are focused firmly on the fall elections, in
which the GOP is defending a narrow, 222-211 majority. The House also has two
independents, one in the Republican orbit, the other aligned with the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite a persistent public claim from Democrats that victory is only a
matter of time, officials speaking on condition of anonymity said House Minority
Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., told his troops to guard against overconfidence.
They said he put the odds of a takeover at 50-50.
</P>
<P>
	   Gephardt has also told fellow Democrats he believes the House may be on the
verge of a political realignment, and if the Democrats win control, moderate
Republicans could defect to their side. Several conservative Democrats switched
to the GOP in the months after the Republicans won a majority in the 1994
elections.
</P>
<P>
	   --------
</P>
<P>
	   One of the oddities in this election season is the steady growth in the
number of House members without major party opposition this fall -- 16 Democrats
and 10 Republicans thus far.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent additions to the list include Republican Reps. Bud Shuster and Jon
Peterson of Pennsylvania and Richard Burr and Howard Coble of North Carolina.
Coble serves on the Judiciary Committee, which conducted President Clinton's
impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats without GOP opponents include Reps. Chaka Fattah and William Coyne
of Pennsylvania and Alan Mollohan and Nick Rahall of West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   --------
</P>
<P>
	   With two weeks remaining until the filing deadline, Democrats are still
hoping former Nebraska Gov. Ben Nelson will decide to enter the race to succeed
a retiring Sen. Bob Kerrey. Nelson won two terms running statewide for governor,
although he lost a Senate race in 1996 to Republican Chuck Hagel. Even so,
Democrats view Nelson as their best hope to hold onto Kerrey's seat.
</P>
<P>
	   There are four Republicans in the race, including the state attorney
general, Don Stenberg; the secretary of state, Scott Moore; as well as Elliott
Rustad, a physician, and George Grogan, a businessman.

<HEADLINE> Chairman Blocks Dominican Rep Aid  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BRISCOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trying to get action in a 1991 murder case, the House
International Relations Committee chairman is holding up more than $8 million in
aid to the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican Rep. Benjamin Gilman invoked a seldom-used authority he has to
block foreign aid. His aim is to pressure the Dominican Republic government into
extraditing a man accused of gunning down his wife in Gilman's New York
congressional district.
</P>
<P>
	   Gilman informed Secretary of State Madeleine Albright by letter Friday that
he was stopping nearly all assistance to the Caribbean country until it
extradites Carlos Daniel Grullone to stand trial in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Gilman's office announced the decision late Friday. There was no immediate
reaction from the State Department or from the Dominican Republic government.
</P>
<P>
	   Grullone, 36, is wanted in the Oct. 16, 1991, death of his wife, Yolina
Arcenia Camacho, at a hotel where she worked in Tarrytown, N.Y. Police say he
shot her several times in front of five witnesses. He fled to the Dominican
Republic, his home country, and was jailed there for six months before being
released because of an error over the amount of his bail.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We in Washington must honor the need of Yolina's children to see justice
done in this case,'' Gilman said. Her two children, Dahiana, now 14, and
Richard, 10, are staying with her mother in Tarrytown.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright had informed Gilman's committee last week of plans to redirect
previously planned spending and give $3 million for the Dominican Republic to
strengthen human rights, $2 million for democratic initiatives, $1.65 million to
increase productivity of poor people, $1.3 million for strengthening civil
society and $1.6 million for AIDS prevention.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to Albright, Gilman said he was invoking his authority as
International Relations Committee chairman to put a hold on all but the AIDS
money. Under informal agreements, each of the chairmen of House and Senate
foreign affairs committees and foreign operations appropriations subcommittees
has the power to reject changes in foreign spending plans of the administration.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The government of the Dominican Republic's apparent callous disregard for
the anguish of these children is contemptible,'' Gilman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tarrytown Detective Sgt. Gene Buonanno, who has been pursuing Grullone's
extradition for nearly a decade, said the children want to visit relatives in
their homeland but cannot because their father is free there.
</P>
<P>
	   In a telephone interview Friday, Buonanno said he investigated the murder
and has pursued Grullone ever since. The man, he said, fled the scene after
shooting his wife during an argument in front of witnesses and was arrested two
months later in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
	   Reacting to Gilman's action, the detective said, ``This is what we've been
looking for. We need help. This man committed murder here eight years ago, and
we haven't been able to get him back.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said prosecutors have tried to have Grullone extradited, and his children
have written to Dominican President Leonel Fernandez asking for their father's
extradition.
</P>
<P>
	   Dominican authorities have cited technicalities in refusing to send Grullone
back to New York for trial, Buonanno said.

<HEADLINE> Charter Schools Movement Growing  </HEADLINE>
   By ANJETTA McQUEEN AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Four hundred new charter schools opened last school year,
reflecting families' increased interest in alternatives to more traditional, but
often lower-performing public schools.
</P>
<P>
	   About 250,000 children are now served by 1,500 charter schools, a 40 percent
increase in such institutions in the 1998-99 school year, the Education
Department reported in its fourth annual study on charter schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Charter schools -- public schools created by parents and teachers and run
with exemptions from most state laws and regulations -- represent a public
school-choice for parents in poor communities, where schools often struggle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can see that there is a continued need for our support of these
schools,'' Education Secretary Richard Riley said in releasing the report
Friday. ``Public charter schools are providing parents and students with choice
they want and deserve.''
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton and Republicans alike have supported public charter
schools with increased public funding since the nation's first charter school
opened in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration, though, favors public school choice over conservatives'
proposals to use public funds to send children to private or parochial schools.
Clinton is seeking a $30 million increase to a total $175 million for the
federal program that helps states open more of the public charter schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Just eight years ago, when Clinton was first elected, there was one such
school -- in Minnesota. Today, 1,484 schools, many with multiple sites, operate
in 27 states and the District of Columbia, with 37 states and the District
having laws supporting their establishment. New York, Oklahoma and Oregon passed
the latest measures last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 90,000 children were served by 421 newly opened charter schools in
the last school year, the department reported.
</P>
<P>
	   A charter school, created by a group of teachers, community members or
parents, is free of most state laws and regulations but must be approved by a
local chartering authority. A charter outlines its goals, procedures and
standards to that authority. Charters that fail to meet them are shut down; 27
schools closed under those circumstances last year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Though charters serve less than 1 percent of all public schoolchildren, the
charter school movement remains popular. Seven in 10 schools told department
researchers they have waiting lists.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet charters have opponents who note that they could drain the most
motivated students and families from traditional public schools -- not to
mention the public money needed to fix the failing schools in the first place.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, charters schools have run into trouble for serving specific
populations and about a quarter of them do just that, the report said. By virtue
of being based in minority communities where they have been especially popular
or opened with specific purposes such as helping troubled children, some schools
have ended up being predominantly black.
</P>
<P>
	   A growing number of parents are challenging decades-old desegregation orders
to protect their charter schools.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Justice Department has blocked just three charters; roughly 50 more
could be affected by court-ordered actions to end patterns of racial separation
in school districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike the schools in Lufkin, Texas; Oktibbeha County, Miss.; and Georgetown
County, S.C., most charters -- which are small -- usually don't affect racial
patterns, Justice Department officials have said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Helps Steel Industry  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. steel manufacturers have further protection from a
flood of foreign imports with a decision by President Clinton to impose penalty
tariffs of 19 percent and 10 percent on two types of steel.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House announced late Friday that Clinton had decided to impose
higher tariffs on certain imports of steel wire rod, which is used to hundreds
of products from coats hangers to fencing, and steel welded line pipe, used in
the construction of natural gas and oil pipelines.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration had delayed a decision in both cases for several months
as an internal debate raged over what action to take.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of tariffs argued that in an election year the administration had
to act to protect the domestic industry and its workers. Opponents contended
that the higher tariffs would impose inflationary costs on steel users in the
United States and signal a further U.S. retreat behind protectionist barriers.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan has already said it will bring cases against the United States before
the World Trade Organization, arguing that U.S. actions to impose penalty
tariffs on imports of various types of steel from Japan and other countries
violated WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore, campaigning for the Democratic presidential
nomination, has had to fend off criticism from labor groups, including the
United Steelworkers union, that the administration's trade policies have failed
to protect American workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Steel companies and the Steelworkers union praised Clinton's decision in the
two cases.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The relief announced today should help an industry that has been devasted
by an onslaught of wire rod imports that swelled to record levels in 1999,''
said Charles Owen Verrill Jr, a lawyer representing the domestic industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Roger Schagrin, an attorney for the domestic steel pipe industry, said the
action ``sends a strong message to our foreign trading partners that import
surges which lead to serious injury to the industry and its workers will not be
tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some 4,000 U.S. workers are employed making steel rod and 1,000 produce
steel line pipe.
</P>
<P>
	   South Korea, one of Asian countries hardest hit by the currency crisis, is
the largest foreign supplier of steel line pipe to the United States, accounting
for half of overall imports of the product.
</P>
<P>
	   Trinidad and Tobago, Brazil, Ukraine and Germany are among the biggest
suppliers of wire rod that will be subjected to the penalty tariffs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The action that the president has announced represents a clear statement
of the administration's commitment both to the vigorous enforcement of U.S.
trade laws and to the application of international trade rules,'' White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The tariff on steel rod will be an additional 10 percent on imports that
exceed 1.58 million tons in the first year. The level of imports will be allowed
to increase by 2 percent a year in the second and third years, while the tariff
penalty will drop by 2.5 percentage points a year.
</P>
<P>
	   For pipe, Clinton imposed an additional 19 percent tariff, although the
first 9,000 tons of steel from each supplier country will be exempt from the
higher tariff each year. The penalty tariff will drop to 15 percent in the
second year and 11 percent in the third year.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton acted following rulings by the U.S. International Trade Commission
that increased imports of wire rod and line pipe threatened serious injury to
American producers.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, the administration approved tariff cases affecting other types of
steel as the industry filed a wave of complaints alleging that various countries
were selling steel at unfairly low prices in the United States, a practice known
as dumping.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies involved in the pipe case decided Friday were Geneva Steel,
Vineyard, Utah; IPSCO Tubulars Inc, Camanche, Iowa; LTV Copperweld, Youngstown,
Ohio; Lone Star Steel Co., Dallas; Maverick Tube Corp., Chesterfield, Mo.;
Newport Steel, Newport, Ky.; Northwest Pipe Co., Portland, Oregon, and Stupp
Corp., Baton Rouge, La.
</P>
<P>
	   In the wire rod case, the companies involved were Birmingham Steel Corp.,
Birmingham, Ala.; Connecticut Steel Corp., Charlotte, N.C.; Keystone Steel &AMP;
Wire Co., Dallas; North Star Steel Co., Minneapolis; Northwestern Steel &AMP; Wire
Co., Sterling, Ill., and Atlantic Steel Industries Inc. of Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Austria Sees Cracks in Opposition  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT H. REID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Despite a diplomatic cold shoulder suffered by her
Cabinet colleague, Austria's foreign minister believes cracks are emerging in
Europe's opposition to the new government and its far-right-wing members.
</P>
<P>
	   France and Belgium have taken the most vocal stance within the European
Union against Austria's new coalition; their ministers walked out on a speech by
Austria's social affairs minister at an EU gathering in Lisbon, Portugal, on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   But Foreign Minister Benita Ferrero-Waldner insisted that other EU nations
were not as adamant in punishing Vienna for the inclusion of Joerg Haider's
far-right Freedom Party in the government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One thing is clear,'' Ferrero-Waldner said Friday after the snub. ``Two
countries stand at the very front. The others have gone along out of solidarity
but many of them don't like it.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``A handful'' of governments have privately expressed sympathy for Austria,
she said in an interview due to be published today in the Linz-based Neue
Volksblatt newspaper, though she refused to identify them.
</P>
<P>
	   A prominent German conservative, Bavarian state Gov. Edmund Stoiber,
criticized EU measures against Austria on Friday as ``completely exaggerated.''
</P>
<P>
	   During a visit Friday to the Bavarian capital Munich by Austrian President
Thomas Klestil, Stoiber said the EU must respect democratic decisions of a
sovereign member state.
</P>
<P>
	   In a clear reference to Haider, however, Stoiber said he was commenting
about a European political issue and not ``about a person with whom I have
nothing in common politically and don't want to have anything in common.''
</P>
<P>
	   The 14 other members of the European Union reduced ties with Austria after
the coalition of the Austrian People's and Freedom parties took office last
week. Haider has gained notoriety for past comments praising some Nazi policies,
though he has since apologized.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lisbon ministerial session was the first EU gathering since. The French
and Belgians walked out when Austrian Social Affairs Minister Elisabeth Sickl
rose to speak.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Austrians opposed to the presence of Haider's party in the
coalition showed no sign of easing up on their protests. Several thousand turned
out despite a cold rain for anti-Haider rallies Friday evening in Graz and
Salzburg.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have not elected this government,'' political scientist Barbara Wicha
told a crowd of about 3,000 people in Salzburg. ``We want to make it known that
this government is not Austria. Austria is something else.''
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Officials Seek Calm in Kosovo City  </HEADLINE>
   By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- After a week of violence that sent
hundreds of ethnic Albanians fleeing their homes, the head of the embattled U.N.
mission is promising new measures to restore calm to Kosovo's most volatile
city.
</P>
<P>
	   The violence, sparked by an attack that killed two Serbs, has claimed eight
lives and injured dozens of people, prompting the NATO-led command to send
reinforcements to help French troops barely able to control the deteriorating
situation.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. refugee agency estimates about 800 ethnic Albanians have been
driven from their homes in the Serb-controlled part of Kosovska Mitrovica. U.N.
officials fear that if the trend continues, all the 4,500 Albanians who lived in
the Serb area will soon be gone.
</P>
<P>
	   After a visit Friday to ethnic Albanians living in the Serb-held north side
of the Ibar River, U.N. mission chief Bernard Kouchner announced a series of
measures to bolster security.
</P>
<P>
	   New checkpoints will be set up in the city, new armed patrols will be
conducted and an additional 300 U.N. police will be deployed -- although
Kouchner did not say where they would come from. The United Nations has already
complained it lacks enough police to guarantee security province-wide.
</P>
<P>
	   Kouchner also said the United Nations would enforce a decree issued last
year authorizing police and troops to expel from the city or even the province
any ``troublemakers'' who foment discord. He also said a ``security zone'' would
be established where public protests would be banned.
</P>
<P>
	   About 140 British reinforcements have already moved into the city to
reinforce French troops. Several U.N. policemen have complained that the French
were slow to respond when the violence exploded last week.
</P>
<P>
	   The British joined about 150 German, Dutch, and Italian troops already sent
here as reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
	   The trouble started after a grenade attack on a U.N. relief agency bus
killed two elderly Serbs last week. That triggered a wave of grenade attacks,
shootings and clashes.
</P>
<P>
	   During his brief visit to the Serb area, Kouchner tried to reassure ethnic
Albanians still there of their safety.
</P>
<P>
	   On his way to the north side, Kouchner stopped briefly on the bridge to chat
with three elderly Albanians -- two men and a woman -- who were lumbering across
to the south side carrying clothes and personal items in plastic bags.
</P>
<P>
	   The ethnic Albanians said they were leaving after Serbs banged on their
doors and threatened them if they did not leave immediately.
</P>
<P>
	   Kouchner said he also visited an elderly couple who had been living in the
Serb part of the city for 25 years. He said they wept at the prospect of having
to leave.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I remember it was the same tears when I visited elderly Serbs in
Pristina,'' he said, referring to the Kosovo capital from which most Serbs have
been driven from their homes too.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People are suffering on both sides,'' Kouchner said. ``People are
suffering on the north side. They are looking desperate, and they believe they
have no future. And it's not true at all.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Uses Iced Tea Defense  </HEADLINE>
   By PETE YOST Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Call it the iced tea defense.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore told the FBI he may have been in the bathroom during
key parts of a strategy meeting about fund-raising telephone calls. He drank a
lot of iced tea and was out of the room when the subject came up, Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   Trying to raise questions about the vice president's truthfulness, the
Republican Party this week seized on Gore's statements in the fund-raising
investigation, circulating an e-mail message titled ``Did Al Gore Mislead the
FBI?''
</P>
<P>
	   On the campaign trail in this year's race for the presidency, Gore has tried
to neutralize his role in the fund-raising controversy of 1996 by saying he made
a mistake in phoning prospective donors from the White House during the
Clinton-Gore re-election effort. But political opponents from Bill Bradley to
the GOP are bringing up the topic in a search for vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore camp says the search is fruitless and that political opponents
could end up hurting themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This whole matter has been investigated for years now by everyone from the
FBI to partisan Republican members of Congress, and absolutely no one has ever
made any credible allegations of wrongdoing,'' spokeswoman Laura Quinn said
Friday night. ``There is absolutely nothing new here.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Republican Party has no agenda, they have no vision and they have no
message,'' Gore campaign press secretary Chris Lehane said. ``The only thing
they can do is focus on discredited charges from the past and they do that at
their own peril.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Voters have showed time and time again that they reject that approach in
favor of candidates who talk about the voters' future,'' Lehane added.
</P>
<P>
	   One FBI summary stated that in a 1997 interview, Gore said ``discussions of
the fund-raising calls for him and the president would not have been discussed''
at a key 1995 meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   The summary added that ``the issue of the vice president and the president
making fund-raising calls would have probably been referred to in the November
21 (1995) meeting, but probably only in passing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore also said ``the number of telephone calls to be made by the president
and vice president was never discussed with him and he doubts that the issue was
ever discussed with the president,'' the FBI summary added.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's account of the meeting took a new turn 10 months later when
handwritten notes turned up that appeared to quote the vice president as talking
about fund-raising phone calls at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   In the later FBI interview, Gore said 23 times that he was unable to recall
aspects of the Nov. 21, 1995 meeting and other fund-raising issues brought up by
questioners.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said he normally sits next to President Clinton in such meetings and
that the two sometimes consult while the meeting is going on, thereby missing
the surrounding discussion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The vice president also observed that he drank a lot of iced tea during
meetings, which could have necessitated a restroom break,'' the FBI summary
stated. ``It was not uncommon for him, and for that matter the president, to
excuse themselves from meetings to use the restroom.''
</P>
<P>
	   One handwritten note from the Nov. 21 meeting states: ``VP: `Is it possible
to do a reallocation for me to take more of the events and the calls?''' The
vice president's allocation is typed in as 10 calls. Another note states: ``VP:
`Count me in on the calls.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore ``did not specifically recall the (reallocation) quote, seemingly
attributed to him,'' said the FBI summary. ``He offered that ... it sounds like
the kind of thing he would have said. ... He felt it was the role of the vice
president to take the load off the president. ... He also could not recall'' the
count-me-in ``quote on that page, also seemingly attributed to him.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Leads Payroll; Bush in TV Ads  </HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN D. SALANT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush spent more money on television
advertising last year than any of the other presidential candidates still in the
race, a computer analysis of their latest spending reports shows.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Sen. Bill Bradley was second in TV spending, while his rival for the
Democratic nomination, Vice President Al Gore, had the largest payroll and
Republican Sen. John McCain's campaign spent more than one-third of its money on
fund raising, according to the analysis by the Campaign Study Group, a private
research organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican Bush, who has raised more than $70 million -- more than any other
presidential candidate ever -- spent more on television ads, $6.3 million, than
on payroll, $5.5 million, in 1999. Bob Dole, the 1996 GOP presidential nominee,
spent $7 million on TV throughout his campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spent $10.1 million on fund raising, more than a fourth of the $37.3
million he spent on his campaign through Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike the other candidates, Bush is not accepting federal funds and
therefore can spend as much as he wants. The other candidates are limited to
spending about $40 million before the nominating conventions next summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also spent $6.9 million on other ways to reach voters, including
campaign rallies, bumper stickers, phone banks, and mail such as a brochure sent
to Virginia voters touting his record on education.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's important to look at it in terms of voter contact,'' Bush spokesman
Scott McClellan said. ``We are maximizing our resources to reach the greatest
number of voters in the early key primary states.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, meanwhile, spent $14.2 million through Dec. 31, with more than a
third, $5.7 million, going for fund raising. He raised $15.7 million last year,
including $2 million transferred from his Senate campaign account.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That was the disadvantage McCain faced,'' said Herbert Alexander,
professor emeritus of political science at the University of Southern
California. ``Back then, he had to scrounge. He had a relatively impoverished
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   Since the reports were filed, McCain turned his Feb. 1 victory in New
Hampshire into a fund-raising bonanza, taking in more than $1 million over the
Internet the next day.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Democratic side, Gore spent almost as much money last year on his
campaign payroll than President Clinton spent during the entire 1996 re-election
campaign. Clinton spent $6.4 million on salaries. Gore spent $5.7 million
through Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president moved his campaign headquarters from Washington to
Nashville, Tenn., in October to cut costs and pare staff. Even so, he spent $1.1
million on rent and utilities in 1999, more than any other candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Alexander noted that Gore must limit his spending because he is accepting
taxpayer funds for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's got to worry about what happens once he gets the nomination,''
Alexander said. ``Because of the challenge by Bradley, he had to spend
considerably more than he should have. He didn't conserve enough for the year
2000.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore raised $29 million for his campaign while spending $23.2 million,
including $6.9 million to raise the money.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley took in $27.8 million while spending $19.5 million, including $3.8
million -- far less than Gore -- to get it.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's payroll was almost $1 million less than Gore's for the same
period, allowing the former New Jersey senator to spend 50 percent more than the
vice president on TV ads -- $4.2 million to Gore's $2.8 million.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bill Bradley has outspent us on television everywhere, but we've
out-organized him on the ground,'' Gore spokesman Douglas Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley campaign officials did not return a call seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> McCain Drops Negative Bush Ads  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fearing a backlash from his sharp attacks, Sen. John
McCain is returning to the campaign strategy that fueled his remarkable rise in
the Republican presidential race, again focusing on his dramatic personal story.
</P>
<P>
	   The abrupt change of strategy came after advisers determined the commercials
that went after Texas Gov. George W. Bush were compromising McCain's campaign as
a self-styled political outsider. McCain's new ad, released Friday, embraces his
character and courage, early themes for the maverick senator from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In Vietnam, John McCain stood up to his communist captors and refused
early release from prison,'' an announcer tells views. ``In Washington, he's a
leader attacking big government waste. Attacking the special interests.''
</P>
<P>
	   A week away from this state's critical Republican primary, McCain urged Bush
to follow suit and pledge to run strictly positive ads.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For the rest of this campaign, we will put up positive ads,'' McCain told
reporters in New York City. ``I'd like to encourage Governor Bush to do the same
thing. I hope that he will recognize the damage that this kind of thing does to
the electorate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush quickly rejected the proposal, suggesting that McCain's decision was an
act of politics, not principle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's an old Washington trick. It's a bait-and-switch trick. He runs ads
for 18 days defining me for something I'm not, and then all of a sudden says,
`OK, let's all be quiet.' I'm going to make sure that the people understand
exactly what I believe and exactly where I stand,'' Bush said between campaign
stops in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   The fracas began in the New Hampshire primary campaign, when a McCain ad
said that Bush did not set ``one dime'' from the surplus to protect Social
Security's future -- a charge whose accuracy depends on how the surplus is
defined.
</P>
<P>
	   When that spot aired in South Carolina, Bush fired back with an ad saying
McCain was distorting the truth. That prompted a pair of McCain ads that
compared Bush and his truth-telling to President Clinton. A Bush ad then
suggested McCain is a hypocrite on campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
	   But after a surge of momentum generated by a landslide New Hampshire
victory, McCain's own polling showed his progress slowed because of negative ads
by both campaigns. The surveys did not pick up major slippage but confirmed the
suspicion of some advisers that McCain's ads -- particularly ones linking Bush
to Clinton -- tarnished his clean-scrubbed political image.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls from Tuesday's Delaware primary showed about one quarter of the
Republican voters said McCain had made unfair attacks on his rivals.
</P>
<P>
	   The primary concern in McCain's camp, however, was voter turnout. His
advisers fear that the campaign's nasty tone is alienating independent and
Democratic voters who are the cornerstone of his campaign. Regardless of who
voters blame for the negative turn of events, McCain stands to lose the most if
the atmosphere suppresses turnout, his advisers concluded.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's no question that a negative war is going to lower turnout. We want
more people to come,'' said campaign manager Rick Davis. ``The more people who
show up the better off we are.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's camp, believing that McCain's ads only hurt McCain, had little
interest in letting the issue die. Bush released a new ad Friday that begins by
reminding viewers of McCain's charge: ``Politics is tough,'' Bush says, ``but
when John McCain compared me to Bill Clinton and said I was untrustworthy,
that's over the line.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's advisers say they plan to air another ad this weekend that is sharply
critical of the Arizonan. Though they may be forced to tone down upcoming ads in
response to McCain's challenge, aides said they do not plan to abandon their
strategy to redefine McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This guy runs two weeks of negative ads comparing us to Bill Clinton and
now he wants ease up? This is a guy who will say one thing and do another,''
said Bush strategist Karl Rove. ``He's bowing to the negative consequences of
accusing us of being like President Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain strategist Mike Murphy said his candidate was forced to attack after
Bush went negative, and was returning to his positive instincts. ``We had to
punch back to let our supporters know we're not like Bill Bradley,'' Murphy
said, referring to the Democratic candidate who was slow to respond to Al Gore's
criticisms.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's top advisers, including Murphy and Davis, had tentatively decided
to recommend a change in strategy Thursday, when a woman stood up in a McCain
event and emotionally accused Bush's campaign of making negative calls to South
Carolina Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain denounced Bush's campaign. The decision was sealed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The senator has good instincts,'' Davis said. ``He knew we couldn't go
negative after that.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Defends His Record in Senate  </HEADLINE>
   By MATT KELLEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite some high-profile losses, Sen. John McCain's
legislative record includes successes in giving the president line-item veto
power, banning lobbyist gifts and helping elderly wage-earners.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's defeats on campaign finance reform and the 1998 tobacco settlement
are well known. His GOP presidential rival, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, portrays
McCain as a do-nothing lawmaker rather than the maverick reformer McCain claims
to be.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said Friday he succeeded during his 17 years in Congress in reforming
Washington politics and helping to cut government regulation of business.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've passed more legislation than any other senator in the last session of
Congress,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   The record shows McCain successfully backed laws banning senators from
taking lobbyists' gifts, reducing the ``earnings test'' that cuts Social
Security benefits for the working elderly and giving the president line-item
veto authority, which the Supreme Court later struck down.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also has worked to block taxes on Internet commerce and has helped
pressure TV networks make their ratings system more understandable.
</P>
<P>
	   At least one Bush supporter, Sen. Bob Bennett, R-Utah, said the governor's
criticism was off base.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not fair to say McCain has been an ineffective senator,'' said
Bennett, citing McCain's work on military and business issues as successes.
</P>
<P>
	   Conversely, McCain has been on the losing side of issues ranging from
changing rules for telephone and cable television companies to authorizing
ground troops in the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's had a series of amendments on domestic and international issues that
haven't gone anyplace,'' said American University political science professor
James Thurber. ``His best coalition was behind campaign finance reform, and he
didn't get 60 votes to overcome a filibuster.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain entered the campaign finance fray during his first term as one of the
``Keating five'' senators with links to Arizona financier Charles Keating, whose
Lincoln Savings &AMP; Loan went under and cost the government $3.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate Ethics Committee said in 1991 that McCain had shown ``poor
judgment'' -- but did not break the rules -- by meeting with thrift regulators
after taking campaign money and vacation trips from Keating. Stung, McCain began
a drive to curtail political spending by special interest groups.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain and Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., have offered a series of campaign
finance reform bills, failing every year since 1996 to get the 60 supporters
needed to force a vote.
</P>
<P>
	   The fight has alienated some of McCain's Republican colleagues in the
Senate, who said his talk of the insidious influence of special interests tarred
all senators as corrupt.
</P>
<P>
	   Another uphill battle for McCain was tobacco. Asked by GOP leaders to handle
the legislation needed to implement a settlement of states' health lawsuits,
McCain became a zealous advocate of a measure that would have raised at least
$156 billion over 25 years by raising cigarette taxes. Republican opposition
killed the measure, and opponents criticized McCain for offering a tax increase.
</P>
<P>
	   As chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee,
McCain backed laws to limit businesses' liability for Y2K glitches and to impose
a moratorium on taxing Internet businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was the lone Republican to vote against the sweeping 1996
telecommunications bill, saying it did not go far enough to spur competition in
telephone and cable television markets.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also has pressed for more and longer flights to and from Reagan
National Airport near Washington, saying that would lead to lower fares and more
room for smaller airlines.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics have pointed out that the rules McCain championed would help some
large campaign donors, such as Arizona-based America West Airlines and regional
telephone company U S West. McCain says he has often voted against the interests
of campaign donors.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain headed the Indian Affairs Committee before taking over at the
Commerce Committee in 1997. He has drawn praise from tribal leaders for writing
bills that help tribes run government programs themselves, protect Indian
religious freedom and promote reservation economic development.
</P>
<P>
	   On social issues, McCain has opposed abortion and gun control and has
supported the death penalty and government-funded vouchers for private schools.
</P>
<P>
	   He voted last year to convict President Clinton on both impeachment counts.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain is a former Navy pilot who was shot down and spent 5 1/2 years as a
prisoner of war in Vietnam. He led a drive to restore formal relations with the
communist country.

	   He has criticized U.S. military involvement in Lebanon, Somalia and Bosnia,
but has worked to block efforts to cut funding for the Bosnia mission after
troops were stationed there.

<HEADLINE> Voting Record of Sen. John McCain  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   From the voting record of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.:
ABORTION:
</P>
<P>
	   Has opposed abortion, voting against allowing abortions at federally funded
clinics or military hospitals, supporting a ban on a late-term abortion
procedure opponents call ``partial birth abortion'' and voting to deny federal
employees insurance coverage for abortions. Some anti-abortion activists have
criticized McCain's vote in 1997 against a ban on research using fetal tissue.
CRIME/GUNS:
</P>
<P>
	   Voted repeatedly against gun control measures such as a five-day waiting
period before buying a handgun. Supported 1999 measure requiring background
checks for purchasers at gun shows and mandating trigger locks. Supported the
federal death penalty, including for killers who were under 18 at the time of
the crime, and measures to restrict death row inmates' appeals.
MILITARY:
</P>
<P>
	   Opposed some military spending he called unnecessary, such as the Seawolf
submarine and the B-2 bomber. Voted against delaying the military base-closing
process. Opposed a 1991 measure to lift the ban on women flying combat missions,
but also opposed a 1998 measure to require separate training for male and female
troops. Opposed allowing homosexuals to serve openly in the military. Criticized
sending troops to Lebanon, Somalia and Bosnia but voted in 1999 to preserve
funding for the Bosnia military mission.
EDUCATION:
</P>
<P>
	   Supported plans to issue government-funded vouchers to send students to
private schools. Supported cutting federal funding to schools that deny students
the right to voluntarily pray. Opposed allowing schools to distribute condoms or
other contraceptives without parental consent. Opposed President Clinton's

	   Opposed allowing ``salvage'' logging in spotted owl habitat. Supported
charging mining companies market value for mining claims on federal land.
Opposed raising grazing fees on federal land. Opposed setting aside California
desert wilderness area.

which reduces Social Security benefits for the working elderly. Supported
successful drive to raise the amount of income exempt from the earnings test.
CAMPAIGN FINANCE:
</P>
<P>
	   Co-sponsored a series of bills that failed to gain the 60 votes needed to
end a filibuster. First version would have banned donations from political
action committees and would have offered free and reduced-cost broadcast time to
candidates who adhered to voluntary spending limits. Next version would have
restricted some political advertising by groups not directly affiliated with
candidates and banned ``soft money'' -- the unlimited donations to political
parties that may be used to buy ads supporting or opposing candidates on the
issues. Latest version would only ban soft money.
INDIAN ISSUES:
</P>
<P>
	   Blocked a drive to repeal the Indian Child Welfare Act, which gives Indian
relatives the first opportunity to give foster care or adopt Indian children.
Sponsored bills to expand and streamline the process for tribes to take over
operations of government programs. Backed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act,
which sets the framework for tribes to offer gambling on reservations. Backed
measures to protect Indian sacred sites and promote Indian religious freedom.

<HEADLINE> President Sites 'Clinton Fatigue'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- ``Clinton fatigue'' is the term politicians use for the
suspicion that voters may tilt Republican this year because they're growing
tired of President Clinton and those associated with him after seven years in
office.
</P>
<P>
	   Tongue in cheek, Clinton gave the term a different twist Friday when asked
by a reporter what he thought of ``Clinton fatigue'' and whether ``Clinton
fatigue'' might limit his campaigning for Democrats this year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Well, I get tired from time to time,'' he said. ``That's the only one I'm
familiar with.''
</P>
<P>
	   But he went on to say that he gets more requests to appear at political
events than he can handle.
</P>
<P>
	   Anyway, ``I always feel that people running for office are the best judge of
what's in their own interest, not me,'' he added. ``And I got plenty to do
here.''
</P>
<P>
	   CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Another stretch on the road has yielded another
batch of ``Bushisms.''
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Gov. George W. Bush remarked to an audience at the seaside resort of
Kiawah Island on Friday that he was raised in the desert.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Last time I saw this much money, I mean water,'' Bush said, as the
well-heeled crowd laughed. Bush ignored his slip and plowed ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, addressing a student audience at the College of Charleston, Bush
said: ``I'm loving because I can't stand the politics of pitting one generation
of people against another.'' He was trying to explain why he is running for
president.
</P>
<P>
	   At another point, Bush spoke about a generation that has become wealthy
through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These young kids, who have become rich beyond their means,'' he said,
intending to say rich beyond their years.
</P>
<P>
	   During an earlier 18-day stretch through Iowa and New Hampshire, the
governor showed he could flub words just like his dad, former President Bush.
The governor congratulated pupils at an elementary school on their theme of the
month, perseverance, but repeatedly called it preservation.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   BY THE NUMBERS:
</P>
<P>
	   $2.3 million -- Amount of money raised by Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch in his
failed bid for the GOP nomination, as of Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   $2.1 million -- Amount of money raised by perennial Democratic candidate
Lyndon LaRouche in his 2000 campaign, as of Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   VOTER'S VOICE:
</P>
<P>
	   ``McCain seems like a fresh, hard-charging guy. Besides, I could wreak havoc
on them Republicans.'' Naylor Smith of Camden, S.C., a loyal Democrat who plans
to vote for McCain in the Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   THIS DATE FOUR YEARS AGO
</P>
<P>
	   Republican Lamar Alexander predicted: ``By the time we get out of New
Hampshire, there will be two candidates who really have a chance to be nominated
and elected. And one will be Senator Dole and the other will be me.''
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton drew huge crowds in two frenzied days of Iowa campaigning.
In a state soaked with negative GOP ads, he let Iowa sidekick Sen. Tom Harkin
carve up the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democrats' real opposition is the Republican House speaker, Harkin said.
``It's Newt Gingrich and his radical right-wing agenda.'' He added: ``Actually,
I like to call them Newtie and the blowhards.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   FRIDAY'S ROUNDUP
</P>
<P>
	   Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura broke free of the ``hopelessly dysfunctional''
Reform Party and recommended his state party do the same.
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush called on McCain to release names of all his Internet donors
and mocked McCain for raising money from special interests while championing
campaign finance reform. McCain, raising money in New York City, said it is a
``legitimate concern'' that fighting between the Republican candidates could
weaken the eventual nominee in the general election. He also said he won't run
any more negative ads.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore conceded his position on abortion has shifted over
the years and accused Bill Bradley of trying to drive a wedge between Democrats.
Bradley said Gore, who now speaks in favor of abortion rights, should explain
why he changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   WEEKEND'S TRAIL:
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley and Gore both campaign in California today, speaking to the state
Democratic convention. Bush campaigns in South Carolina today before flying to
Texas and taking Sunday off. McCain campaigns in South Carolina through the
weekend.

<HEADLINE> Party Strikes Back at Ventura  </HEADLINE>
   By ROCHELLE OLSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Reform Party is striking back at its dissenting
top officeholder, Jesse Ventura, by moving to oust chairman Jack Gargan, an ally
of the Minnesota governor.
</P>
<P>
	   Ventura's break with the national party on Friday was timed to pre-empt the
national party's meeting here today, at which members loyal to founder Ross
Perot were expected to vote to topple Gargan.
</P>
<P>
	   Gargan, who took office Jan. 1, has been unable to control the warring
factions loyal to Ventura and Perot. Members have fought each other over the
Internet, in the press and in court over the direction of the party, its rules,
where to hold the nominating convention and whom to support for president this
year.
</P>
<P>
	   The battling has hobbled the Reform Party on the cusp of an election year in
which it will bestow $12.6 million in federal funds upon its presidential
candidate. Indeed, it threatens the future of a party that put Ventura into the
highest elective office in the organization's history.
</P>
<P>
	   At a news conference Friday outside the governor's mansion in St. Paul,
Ventura said the Nashville meeting today would only cripple the party's national
growth.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Jack Gargan was elected through a total, fair process to be the leader of
our party, and tomorrow they're holding a meeting where they're going to try to
vote him out as the leader of the party,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're trying to do it illegally,'' Ventura added, referring to the much
fought-over party rules. ``You have a small group of power brokers in this party
that won't allow it to grow nationally, and that's not conducive to what we want
to do in Minnesota.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gargan arrived Friday afternoon at a Nashville airport hotel, the meeting
site, while maintaining that the gathering would be held in violation of the
party's rules.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the Minnesota state Reform Party was holding its own meeting
today, at which Ventura ally and state chairman Rick McCluhan was expected to
ask the state central committee to call a convention March 4 to vote on
disaffiliation.
</P>
<P>
	   Ventura and his supporters have never been close to the national Reform
Party. Perot, who ran for president in 1996 under the Reform banner, provided no
help in the governor's 1998 victory.
</P>
<P>
	   The party has been struggling ever since, not only to settle on leadership
but to find a unifying set of beliefs aside from a common disenchantment with
the Democratic and Republican parties.
</P>
<P>
	   Ventura said the national party had played ``zero'' role in his election;
meanwhile, former Reform chairman Russ Verney, a close Perot ally, said Ventura
provided ``zero'' leadership for the party. The governor's departure will have a
minimal impact, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It means that we're free of threats and we can once again go back to
grass-roots democracy where every elected leader of the party can respond to
their constituents instead of to ultimatums,'' Verney said.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, Ventura has never shown much interest in building the Minnesota or
national Reform parties. Some political observers considered Friday's move
merely the latest in a continuing sideshow.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It would be comical if it weren't so pathetic: the range of candidates
considering a Reform Party candidacy, the squabbling, the egomania,'' said
Thomas Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think
tank.
</P>
<P>
	   Former independent presidential candidate John Anderson called the Reform
Party ``badly fractured,'' but he held out hope for Ventura's role in a
third-party movement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think he could be the modern-day equivalent of the leader of a populist
revolt against the two-party system,'' Anderson said. He added that he, at 77,
would consider another presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
	   The third-party movement now represented by Reform was founded by Perot as
his vehicle in presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas billionaire won 8 percent of the popular vote in 1996, down from
19 percent in 1992 when he barreled onto the scene as an independent voice
agitating for balanced budgets, a tough stance on trade and campaign reform.

<HEADLINE> Church Battle Over First Amendment  </HEADLINE>
   By AMALIE YOUNG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A United Methodist church has been told by a city
official to limit worship services, sparking what could be a landmark fight over
the church's constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Derek Davis, a Baylor University religion scholar, said he believes this is
the first time a government official has tried to limit attendance at a
particular church.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's astonishing,'' said Mark Reid, co-pastor at Sunnyside Centenary
United Methodist Church. ``It's really out in left field to say that you can
only have a certain number of people in worship.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elizabeth Normand, the land-use hearing officer who issued the Jan. 17
ruling, said she doesn't understand what all the fuss is about. The target of
her ruling was a meals program for the homeless at the church.
</P>
<P>
	   Between 70 and 100 people attend the twice-a-week meals program, which is in
its 16th year. Normand's ruling would cancel the dinners.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunnyside is one of many older neighborhoods in Portland that has gone
upscale recently. Neighborhood concerns about the meals program have escalated
in the last two years, with some residents complaining of alcohol- and
drug-related activities and disturbances by people who attend the Wednesday and
Friday dinners.
</P>
<P>
	   The neighborhood association had asked the city to end the meals program at
the 100-year-old church.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've been there for a long time, and the congregation has a long history
of trying to do social ministries,'' said Tim Lewis, co-pastor at the church.
``Some people in the neighborhood who haven't been there very long have very
little understanding of what the church has been doing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis said that the church voluntarily shut down the meals program for three
months. They also started a telephone line for neighbors to call in concerns,
hired a security guard and trained a foot-patrol to walk the neighborhood during
the program.
</P>
<P>
	   Even so, problems persisted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Somehow, the people seem to blame us for whatever happens in the
neighborhood,'' Reid said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Normand's 30-page ruling also put a limit on the number of people who
can attend worship services, although it is not clear why she did that.
</P>
<P>
	   She has declined to explain her reasoning, calling the matter a
``quasi-judicial process.''
</P>
<P>
	   Her ruling also places conditions on the operation of Sunnyside's nighttime
shelter, a day-care center and its Indochinese Socialization Center.
</P>
<P>
	   Normand is perplexed that her decision to limit attendance at Sunnyside has
so passionately stirred the emotions of Portland's religious community.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That was not the main focus of the decision and it's interesting that this
is the thing everyone is talking about,'' she told The Oregonian. ``I'm getting
calls from citizens, newspapers, television stations, you name it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The church plans to appeal the decision in a March City Council hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Reid said the ruling has brought some blessings, because local religious
groups have banded together to denounce the decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Rabbi Joseph Wolf of Havurah Shalom called Normand's ruling an infringement
of religious freedoms protected by the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think very clearly the distinction being drawn in very arbitrary and
specious,'' he said. ``The church or synagogue is open to celebrate all week
long ... especially to dine and come to the table with one another and offer
prayer.''

<HEADLINE> Citrus Canker Emergency Declared  </HEADLINE>
   By JACKIE HALLIFAX Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida has already cut down and burned 500,000
trees in the war on citrus canker, many of them in back yards in Miami and Fort
Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
	   But state leaders say more must be done -- and fast.
</P>
<P>
	   The goal is to eradicate canker in south Florida in a year to protect the
state's $8 billion citrus industry and residential citrus trees. The cost: $110
million and the destruction of probably a million more trees.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, Bush declared a state of emergency in Miami-Dade, Broward and
four other counties to free money to speed the state's eradication program. The
state has been battling canker, mostly in Miami-Dade and Broward counties, since
1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, Bush said, ``it's time to take it up a notch or two.''
</P>
<P>
	   Agriculture Commissioner Bob Crawford said the state must fight harder to
block the canker's destructive spread.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we don't do it, the scientists assure me that it's all over and we've
lost, and it'll spread throughout the state,'' he said. ``Next we'll lose our
citrus industry, and people will lose their backyard trees as well.''
</P>
<P>
	   The emergency declaration allows a $35 million withdrawal from a state
emergency fund to fight the disease. Florida officials hope the federal
government will cover some of the rest.
</P>
<P>
	   Canker-infected trees show lesions on the leaves, stems and fruit. The
disease causes the fruit to fall prematurely and ultimately can kill the tree.
Burning exposed trees is the only way to prevent its spread.
</P>
<P>
	   Growers consider canker the primary threat to their industry and support the
eradication plan, according to Ron Hamel, executive vice president of Gulf
Citrus Growers Association, which represents 160 growers in southwest Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The sooner the better as far as we're concerned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The state already has lost 200,000 residential trees and 300,000 trees in
commercial groves to the disease. The plan announced Friday increases the range
in which exposed or infected trees must be cut and the number of crews working
to cut and burn the infected trees.

<HEADLINE> Grozny Refugees Fear of No Return  </HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW KRAMER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SLEPTSOVSKAYA, Russia (AP) -- A push by Russian troops to flush out the last
remaining rebels in Grozny raises little hope among refugees of returning soon.
There is hardly anything to go home to in the ruins of the Chechen capital.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When I left, whole buildings just didn't exist anymore,'' said Adam
Aktamirov, 41, who fled the city for neighboring Ingushetia in January as
Russian troops battled rebels for Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are no roofs left. Nobody will go back. Where will they go?'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly a week after Russian troops claimed to have the city under control,
Russian authorities appear to have no firm plans on returning the population of
the nearly deserted city. For now, they remain in tent camps near the border.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In principle, not one important question regarding the refugees has been
decided,'' said Timirkhan Akiyev, an official in the Migration Service in
Ingushetia, the Russian province on Chechnya's border.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Russia has pressured refugees from other parts of Chechnya to
return home as towns are secured, officials often express doubts about whether
Grozny residents can ever go home.
</P>
<P>
	   The military commander of Grozny, Maj. Gen. Vasily Prizemlin, has said the
city is uninhabitable.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's unlikely that the peaceful population will come back because the
entire city is ruined,'' he told the NTV television station last week after
troops raised a flag over the city center.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Grozny residents interviewed in camps said most apartment blocks in
the city were destroyed beyond repair, although some private homes may be
salvageable.
</P>
<P>
	   The city that now is a grim ruin -- its streets so wrecked that even tanks
have difficulty on them -- once was far different. Before the first Chechen war
started in 1994, Grozny had a population of 675,000, spread out in leafy suburbs
overlooking two rivers in the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   That war, which ended in 1996, wrecked much of the city. But 400,000 people
still lived there as of last summer, when the new fighting began, said Magomed
Gireyev, director of the Ingush Migration Service.
</P>
<P>
	   About 70,000 former residents are now refugees in Ingushetia, he said.
Others left for villages and towns inside Chechnya, and an estimated 15,000 to
40,000 remained in the city through five months of bombing.
</P>
<P>
	   The hardest-hit areas of the city were neighborhoods of high-rise apartment
blocks, refugees say. The buildings were used as fortresses in the street
fighting, and are now porous ruins.
</P>
<P>
	   Many refugees from these areas said they despair of ever returning.
</P>
<P>
	   Some people who lived in private homes on the city's outskirts said they
want to return eventually, but for now fear attacks on civilians by the Russian
troops and the possibility that rebels will stage a sneak attack on the city, as
they did during the 1994-6 war.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Russian officials appear to have stalled on deciding what to do
with the city, won at the cost of hundreds of dead soldiers and at least
hundreds of civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   President Vladimir Putin's envoy to Chechnya, Nikolai Koshman, said that
``today there is no money,'' to repair the city.
</P>
<P>
	   ``First we must study the scale of the destruction, then we can speak about
the future of the Chechen capital,'' he said. Koshman has earlier suggested
moving the capital to Gudermes, a smaller city east of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   Only a few refugees contemplate going home, and for them it is not a joyous
choice.
</P>
<P>
	   Magomed Usmanov, 34, who lived in the suburb of Staraya Sunzha on the city's
outskirts, said he hopes to return and rebuild his one-story house, explaining
``I have nowhere to go.''

<HEADLINE> Giuliani: 'Give me a break, I'm running'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - Five days after Hillary Rodham Clinton
formally announced she is running for the U.S. Senate, Rudolph Giuliani
informally did the same.
<P>
	   "Give me a break, I'm running," the New York City mayor said in his feisty
fashion. For Clinton, it had been, "I am honored today to announce my candidacy
for the U.S. Senate from New York."
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani's statement was no surprise. Like Clinton, he has been campaigning
for months, but it was the first time he had announced it so forthrightly. It
came after a stump speech on the porch of the clapboard house that serves as
party headquarters for the Westchester County Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if he was an official candidate, he said, "I don't know what an
official candidate is. I am very interested in running. I am running. Look what
I'm doing, I'm not walking. ... Give me a break, I'm running."
</P>
<P>
	   Until Friday, Giuliani had found various ways to avoid saying that. He came
closest when he said, "Looks that way" when a questioner asked if he planned to
run.
</P>
<P>
	   But he also said, "There's always doubt."
</P>
<P>
	   His campaign manager, Bruce Teitelbaum, said Friday that the mayor's
statement "should not be construed as his official announcement. ... There may
not be one."
</P>
<P>
	   Westchester County Republican Chairman Jim Cavanaugh said the mayor told
lunch companions that he didn't want to make "a Hollywood-style announcement."
</P>
<P>
	   "By kind of slipping it in like that, that seems to be how he wants to do
it," Cavanaugh said.
</P>
<P>
	   But the chairman himself was happy that his party headquarters was the scene
of the announcement. "Maybe we'll put up a plaque," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton campaign spokeswoman Karen Dunn said, "We welcome the mayor to the
race. Maybe now he will start talking about what he would do as a United States
senator."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton made her formal announcement Sunday, in a college gymnasium packed
with thousands of supporters and bedecked with red, white and blue posters.
Giuliani's statement Friday came before about 150 people, many of them local
Republican officials, on the porch, the snowy lawn and the sidewalk outside the
party headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   In his speech, the mayor poked fun at Clinton's house-hunting in
Westchester.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know what all the fuss is about," he said. "I'm just hanging around
here looking for a house."

Grozny Refugees Fear of No Return
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SLEPTSOVSKAYA, Russia (AP) -- A push by Russian troops to flush out the last
remaining rebels in Grozny raises little hope among refugees of returning soon.
There is hardly anything to go home to in the ruins of the Chechen capital.
Nearly a week after Russian troops claimed to have the city under control,
Russian authorities appear to have no firm plans on returning the population of
the nearly deserted city. For now, they remain in tent camps near the border.
"In principle, not one important question regarding the refugees has been
decided," said Timirkhan Akiyev, an official in the Migration Service in
Ingushetia, the Russian province on Chechnya's border.

Space Shuttle Endeavour Blasts Off

	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Endeavour and a crew of six
roared into orbit Friday on a long-delayed mission to create the finest map of
Earth ever produced. "We're ready to map the world," said commander Kevin
Kregel. Just 5 1/2 hours later, the astronauts began extending a 197-foot radar
antenna mast from the shuttle cargo bay. It was a tense job and, by far, the
biggest challenge of the mission. Within 17 minutes, the towerlike mast was all
the way out -- and the longest rigid structure ever deployed in space. "A long
train out there," observed Mission Control.

	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Reform Party is striking back at its dissenting
top officeholder, Jesse Ventura, by moving to oust chairman Jack Gargan, an ally
of the Minnesota governor. Ventura's break with the national party on Friday was
timed to pre-empt the national party's meeting here Friday, at which members
loyal to founder Ross Perot were expected to vote to topple Gargan. Gargan, who
took office Jan. 1, has been unable to control the warring factions loyal to
Ventura and Perot.

Abdurrahman Wahid said. Wahid, in Bangkok for a U.N. trade meeting, said
Saturday he would meet with Wiranto after his return to Indonesia and expects
him to resign within two days. Wahid, who has been traveling outside Indonesia
for about two weeks, first called for Wiranto's resignation on Jan. 31 after an
Indonesian government investigation blamed the general for the mayhem in East
Timor last year when the territory voted to break away from Indonesia in a

Northern Ireland on Friday, stripping power from the province's new
Protestant-Catholic administration -- its best chance at self-rule -- in hopes
of preventing the coalition's collapse. But within hours of the move, the
British and Irish governments announced that the Irish Republican Army had
softened its traditional refusal to disarm. That hopeful news, following an
agonizing week of behind-the-scenes negotiations did not deter Northern Ireland
Secretary Peter Mandelson from revoking the Cabinet's substantial powers just 72
days after handing them over.

Other Planes Have Wing Tail Glitch
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The same tail wing problem that has become the focus of
the investigation into last week's crash of an Alaska Airlines plane was found
during government-mandated inspections Friday in at least three other jetliners.
The Federal Aviation Administration ordered inspections of all MD-80 and similar
aircraft. Preliminary inspections, which affect about 1,200 planes, must be
completed by Monday, but the FAA is giving airlines 30 days to perform a more
detailed check.

<HEADLINE> More Jets Found With Tail Problems  </HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW FORDAHL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An equipment problem suspected in the crash of Alaska
Airlines Flight 261 has cropped up in at least five other jetliners this week
during government-ordered inspections.
</P>
<P>
	   The MD-80 and MD-90 aircraft were found with unusual metal shavings in or
around a control mechanism in their tail wings, National Transportation Safety
Board officials said Friday. The same equipment in the doomed plane was found in
a similar condition.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest cases, involving one Alaska Airlines and two Delta Air Lines
jets, were uncovered Friday during inspections ordered by the Federal Aviation
Administration. Two Alaska Airlines jets were grounded earlier for the same
reason, prompting the FAA's action.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials have not determined whether the damaged horizontal stabilizer
assembly found in Flight 261's wreckage caused the crash or was a result of the
crash's impact. But pilots had reported trouble with the stabilizer, which helps
keep a plane flying level, before Flight 261 plummeted into the Pacific Ocean on
Jan. 31, killing all 88 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   FAA officials declined to comment on the NTSB's announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have initial, unconfirmed reports that we need to verify before we
release any information,'' said Paul Takemoto, an agency spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   The FAA's inspection order affects about 1,200 planes, including MD-80s,
MD-90s, Boeing 717s and DC-9s. The first part of the inspections must be
completed by Monday, but the FAA is giving airlines 30 days to perform a more
detailed check.
</P>
<P>
	   Delta mechanics found two MD-90s with a gritty residue below the horizontal
stabilizer and took the aircraft out of service at least until today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're continuing to look at the planes and analyzing the residue, but we
strongly suspect we'll have these planes back in service tomorrow,'' said Clay
McConnell, a Delta spokesman. ``There is absolutely nothing to indicate anything
other than normal wear.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines confirmed it had pulled a third plane from service due to a
mechanical problem discovered during the inspection in Portland, Ore. The
carrier would not disclose whether the problem was related to metal shavings.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines canceled a dozen flights Friday as it repeated inspections
made before the FAA issued its order, said spokesman Jack Evans.
</P>
<P>
	   Other airlines reported no major schedule disruptions, but several reported
finding irregularities during the inspections.
</P>
<P>
	   Continental Airlines said a quarter-inch metal shaving was found in the tail
wing mechanism of an out-of-service MD-80 undergoing scheduled maintenance. The
problem was reported to the FAA, but all other inspections were uneventful, a
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Northwest Airlines pulled a DC-9 from service after unspecified
irregularities were found in the tail wing assembly. The section was removed for
analysis and the plane was expected to fly again today, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   American Airlines mechanics in Reno, Nev., discovered an MD-90's tail wing
assembly needed lubrication, but there was no evidence of unusual wear,
spokesman John Hotard said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The FAA was there and signed off and the aircraft was returned to
service,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators probing the crash of Alaska Flight 261 are focusing on a part
that moves the stabilizer, a 40-foot wing high on the tail that controls the
up-and-down pitch of the aircraft's nose.
</P>
<P>
	   A 2-foot, rod-like jackscrew that drives the stabilizer was recovered with
metal shavings believed to have come from an 8-inch gimbal nut -- also retrieved
from the Pacific -- and found to have damaged threads.
</P>
<P>
	   An Associated Press review of maintenance records from 1990 through 1999
found no reports of stripped gimbal nuts in the jetliners covered in the order.
</P>
<P>
	   During voluntary inspections early this week, Alaska mechanics in Portland
and Seattle found two MD-80s with similar shavings in the horizontal stabilizer
assemblies, prompting the FAA's nationwide mandatory inspection order.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the Ventura County Medical Examiner's office has identified the
remains of 35 of the passengers, a spokeswoman said Friday. The office has not
received any new remains since Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Navy reported it recovered significant pieces of wreckage from the ocean
Friday. Among them were large portions of the plane's left and right elevators,
which are part of the horizontal stabilizer system. Also found was an 8-foot
section of the plane's outboard right stabilizer.

<HEADLINE> Blake Signs With Saints  </HEADLINE>
    By JOSH DUBOW AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   While the New Orleans Saints and Atlanta Falcons began the NFL free-agency
period by filling holes, the San Francisco 49ers still need to shed some salary
before they can begin rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
	   The three bottom teams in the NFC West made some of the biggest news in the
NFL on Friday, the first day teams could sign free agents.
</P>
<P>
	   The Saints signed quarterback Jeff Blake to a $17.4 million, four-year
contract, and the Falcons reportedly agreed to terms with cornerback Ashley
Ambrose and wide receiver Shawn Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
	   The 49ers, meanwhile, told Jerry Rice he could be forced out of San
Francisco unless he makes financial concessions to help the 49ers gain
maneuvering room within the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
	   "We would very much like to have Jerry back," 49ers coach Steve Mariucci
said. "The question would be, how do we work it out?"
</P>
<P>
	   Over the last three weeks, the 49ers restructured the contracts of 14
players, including quarterback Steve Young, in an effort to wipe out a $24
million cap overrun.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the 49ers still need more room under the cap to be able to take
part in free agency and to pay their draft picks.
</P>
<P>
	   Rice, 37, the NFL's career receiving leader, has a 2000 cap figure of $5.49
million that the 49ers want to reduce.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, Rice and his agent, Jim Steiner, have balked at the 49ers'
insistence he lower his salary and try to make up for it through an
incentive-based package.
</P>
<P>
	   San Francisco did sign one player, agreeing with cornerback Monty Montgomery
to a one-year contract worth $385,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Blake started most of last season for Cincinnati after rookie Akili Smith
was hurt. Blake completed 55.3 percent of his passes for 16 touchdowns with 14
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
	   The presence of Smith, the third overall pick in last year's draft, made
Blake expendable in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
	   "I see this as a fresh start and a great opportunity," Blake said. "I'm very
happy to be in a position where I don't have to look over my shoulder all the
time. I can just relax and play here. My confidence is very high."
</P>
<P>
	   Blake will step in for Danny Wuerffel and Billy Joe Hobert, who became free
agents on Friday as the Saints begin the rebuilding process.
</P>
<P>
	   New Orleans finished 3-13 last season, its seventh straight year without a
winning record, and coach Mike Ditka and general manager Bill Kuharich were
fired last month.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think over the next week to 10 days we should be able to help the team,"
new GM Randy Mueller said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Saints lost Ambrose, who signed a $22.5 million, five-year contract with
the Falcons, according to CBS Sportsline. The Web site also reported that the
Falcons signed Jefferson to a $14.2 million, four-year deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Ambrose has 24 career interceptions, including six in 1999. He signed a
two-year contract with New Orleans before last season, but the Saints voided the
final year of the deal. They hoped to re-sign him, but talks broke down this
week.
</P>
<P>
	   Jefferson had 40 catches for 698 yards and five touchdowns for New England
last season. He will fill the void left by Tony Martin, who was released by
Atlanta before the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Dallas is close to an agreement to trade its first-round pick to
Seattle for free agent receiver Joey Galloway. The Cowboys would then sign
Galloway -- the Seahawks' franchise player -- for more than $5 million a year,
according to today's Dallas Morning News.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the most coveted free agents, Jacksonville running back James
Stewart, visited Detroit on Friday as the Lions continued a search for a
replacement for Barry Sanders.
</P>
<P>
	   Stewart, who rushed for 931 yards and 13 touchdowns with the Jaguars last
season in place of injured Fred Taylor, will also visit Cleveland this weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   The Browns agreed to terms Friday with defensive tackle Darius Holland on a
two-year contract.
</P>
<P>
	   The Browns also said they will bring in free agent defensive ends Orpheus
Roye and Keith McKenzie for visits this weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Cleveland had hoped to court Arizona's Simeon Rice and Jacksonville's Tony
Brackens during the free-agent signing period that began Friday. But the star
defensive ends were designated franchise players by their teams in the past
three days.
</P>
<P>
	   In other moves, Jacksonville re-signed linebacker Lonnie Marts, Baltimore
signed offensive lineman Damon Denson, and the Super Bowl champion St. Louis
Rams re-signed tight end Ernie Conwell to a $3.9 million, three-year contract.

<HEADLINE> Grand Jury Indicts Lewis, 2 Others  </HEADLINE>
    By JAMES PILCHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Police claim that Reggie Lewis lied. His lawyer claims he's
being railroaded.
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever the truth, a grand jury indicted Lewis and two associates on murder
charges for the stabbing deaths of two men killed after a Super Bowl party.
</P>
<P>
	   Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard Jr. announced the indictments
Friday, saying Lewis and the other two were involved in a Jan. 31 fight that
left the two victims dead.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis, a three-time Pro Bowl linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens, remains in
the Atlanta Detention Center without bail, charged with the deaths of Richard
Lollar, 24, and Jacinth Baker, 21.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense lawyer Ed Garland said he would prove Lewis' "absolute innocence" at
a Monday bond hearing and called the prosecution's case "dishwater weak."
</P>
<P>
	   "You can almost hear the railroad whistle blowing as it goes down the
track," Garland said. "The first passenger was Richard Jewell -- this time it's
Ray Lewis. At the Olympics there was another innocent person trying to help, but
was in the wrong place at the wrong time. They have just done to Ray Lewis what
they did to Richard Jewell, and history is repeating itself."
</P>
<P>
	   Jewell, a security guard at Centennial Olympic Park at the time of the July
1996 park bombing, was named as a suspect, but later cleared by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
	   Garland said Lewis was not a participant in the fight, but tried to stop it.
</P>
<P>
	   Police say Lewis lied to them about who was in his limousine that morning
and tried to protect his friends.
</P>
<P>
	   Howard would not say if investigators believe Lewis stabbed one of the
victims, but he can be charged with murder if he was involved in the fight --
even if someone else killed the men.
</P>
<P>
	   "He participated by punching, encouraging and assisting in the commission of
this crime," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
	   Five of the victims' family members attended the district attorney's news
conference, and Vondie Boykin, Baker's aunt, read a brief statement.
</P>
<P>
	   "God is a just God and he will see to it that justice is served," she said
as Atlanta police chief Beverly Harvard consoled Baker's cousin Patrice Brown by
holding her hand.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI has issued arrest warrants for the other two suspects, Reginald
Oakley of Baltimore and Joseph Sweeting of Miami. Atlanta police say Lewis lied
to officers to protect the two men.
</P>
<P>
	   Each of the men face six charges including felony murder and aggravated
assault with a deadly weapon. A murder conviction in Georgia brings a sentence
of life in prison or the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   Oakley, 31, and Sweeting, 34, are both being sought on federal charges of
unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. The FBI said they should be considered
armed and dangerous, and mug shots of the two men were released.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are appealing to them to turn themselves in," Harvard said.
</P>
<P>
	   Oakley has been convicted of a number of crimes, including assaulting a
police officer, shooting into an occupied dwelling, trafficking cocaine and
embezzlement, Atlanta deputy police chief C.B. Jackson said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Oakley was evicted from his apartment earlier this year, according to Mike
Zimenski, a spokesman for the apartment building's management company.
</P>
<P>
	   A Baltimore television station reported that a man who claims to be a legal
consultant for Oakley said Friday that Oakley is nothing more than a witness to
the murders. WBAL-TV quoted Jesse Ingram as saying Oakley has agreed to return
to Atlanta and cooperate with police.
</P>
<P>
	   Police in Dade County, Fla., said Sweeting has been charged with robbery,
possession of a firearm by a felon, and carrying a concealed firearm.
</P>
<P>
	   No one answered the telephone Friday at Sweeting's parents' home.

<HEADLINE> Griffey Mania Sweeps His Hometown  </HEADLINE>
    By JOE KAY AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) -- So many calls flooded the Cincinnati Reds' offices that
the phone system got overwhelmed and employees couldn't even get lines out.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the Cinergy Field offices, there were lines of fans waiting to get
into the lobby and lines of fans streaming from the ticket windows.
</P>
<P>
	   Politicians who took cover during yet another bad Bengals season were happy
to be seen in photographs with Cincinnati Reds officials. Street corners buzzed
with talk about some guy named Junior who was moving in from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   Ken Griffey Jr., one of Cincinnati's finest and baseball's best, was traded
to his hometown team on Thursday night, and his hometown hasn't been the same.
</P>
<P>
	   It's positively giddy over Griffey.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's just been a 48-hour onslaught -- a very nice onslaught,'' said Mike
Vassallo, the Reds' assistant director of media relations.
</P>
<P>
	   The Reds brought one of baseball's best players home on a private jet
Thursday night after completing a four-for-one trade with Seattle. Griffey
agreed to a nine-year contract that will keep him home for the rest of his
career.
</P>
<P>
	   Even as Griffey's plane touched down, the Reds were unsure what kind of
financial impact the trade ultimately would have on the 131-year-old franchise.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'll be honest with you, we won't know that answer until we get the
response of the fans,'' chief operating officer John Allen said. ``Over the last
three months, we've been hearing, `Get Junior, bring him home and we're coming
out.'
</P>
<P>
	   ``So I can't tell you what the economic impact is. It's up to the fans to
determine what that is.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Reds got the first part of the answer Friday when their office phone
lines were so overwhelmed by calls about tickets that employees had trouble
getting lines out.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Since early yesterday, the phones have just been ringing constantly to the
point where they've been tying up lines,'' Vassallo said. ``We've been having
trouble making and receiving calls. It's just been overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
	   There were lines at the ticket windows on a gray, raw day, and fans
stretched out in the lobby waiting to order season tickets. The Reds wouldn't
estimate how many were sold, but announced that windows would be open Saturday
to accommodate the sudden demand.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think you could say unequivocally that it was one of the best days we've
ever had, relative to selling tickets,'' spokesman Rob Butcher said.
</P>
<P>
	   Opening day already was sold out, so scalpers offered tickets Friday for
many times face value just so fans could get that first glimpse of Junior in a
Reds uniform.
</P>
<P>
	   The city hasn't gotten swept away by a baseball trade since favorite son
Pete Rose returned as player-manager in a 1984 trade with Montreal. A lot had
happened to dampen local interest in baseball in the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Rose's gambling scandal got him banned from the game, slurs by previous
owner Marge Schott cast the team in a bad light, and the 1994 players' strike
extinguished a lot of interest in the city that boasts of the sport's first
professional team.
</P>
<P>
	   Griffey's return was exactly what it needed to make it seem like the good
old days.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While the dollars are not unimportant, the emotional lift that something
like this gives to a community and the national visibility that it creates are
probably even more significant,'' said Roger Ruhl, vice president of marketing
for the local chamber of commerce.
</P>
<P>
	   Part of it was the circumstances. Griffey accepted tens of millions of
dollars less than he could have made as a free agent so he could return to
small-market Cincinnati. He agreed to a $116.5 million deal, with most of the
money deferred until after he retires -- a move to help the tight-budget team.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He makes a wonderful statement by choosing to sign a long-term contract
here with an eye to completing his career in Cincinnati,'' Ruhl said. ``This has
created a great buzz around town, and it's a great chamber of commerce story.
What better story can there be than a youngster returning to his hometown?''
</P>
<P>
	   On the streets of Cincinnati, for now, there is no other story.

<HEADLINE> 'Rolls-Royce for Volkswagen Price'  </HEADLINE>
    By RONALD BLUM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr.'s new contract produced an auto-matic
response from Scott Boras:
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the player owns a Rolls-Royce and he chooses to sell it at Volkswagen
prices, that's his right,'' the agent said Friday, a day after Griffey's $116.5
million, nine-year contract clinched his trade from Seattle to Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
	   Because the total includes $57.5 million in deferred money that won't start
earning interest until 2009, the Reds estimate its present-day value at between
$9.2 million and $9.3 million annually. That's what one agent, speaking on
condition he not be identified, said Cincinnati general manager Jim Bowden told
him.
</P>
<P>
	   Big money, but not so big in an era when Los Angeles pitcher Kevin Brown
averages $15 million and Detroit outfielder Juan Gonzalez is expected to get
$17.5 million a year or more in his extension.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He has agreed to less than what the market value is, but to me, it is in a
unique situation,'' Florida general manager Dave Dombrowski said. ``A player had
a desire to play in one place, had a right to control his destiny and was close
to free agency. I don't know if it's any type of trendsetter.''
</P>
<P>
	   In actual money, Griffey will receive $7 million this year and $6 million in
each of the following eight seasons. By the time he approaches Hank Aaron's
home-run record of 755, he might not be among the top 50 average annual
salaries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This wasn't meant to be some trendsetter,'' said Griffey's agent, Brian
Goldberg, who negotiated the deal. ``This was the right situation for Kenny.
It's not right for me to speak on behalf of other players and what their
priorities are. You want the player to be treated fairly, but by the same token,
you want the fans to still be able to come out, because with things getting
priced too far out of line, there's no game. So you've got to strike that
balance.''
</P>
<P>
	   Cincinnati raised the price of its best tickets from $17 to $21 this year --
the increase was announced in November. The New York Mets, who might have paid
Griffey $20 million annually, have a top price of $57 this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Griffey's presence should build momentum for the Reds' new ballpark, which
they hope will be ready for 2003.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe this transaction has enhanced the franchise value of the
Cincinnati Reds by somewhere between $50 and $100 million dollars immediately,
and long term much more than that,'' said Tom Reich, who represented former Reds
stars Joe Morgan and George Foster.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They got a great deal in getting one of the greatest team-sports players
of all time in a community where his impact will be double because it's a
hometown reunion.''
</P>
<P>
	   In total dollars, Griffey's deal is baseball's highest, eclipsing Brown's
$105 million, seven-year contract. But shortstop Derek Jeter has been
negotiating a $118.5 million, seven-year deal with the New York Yankees (an
average of $16,928,571), and Gonzalez and Detroit have been talking about an
extension said to be worth $140 million.
</P>
<P>
	   But others have taken less than the top of the market. Mark McGwire is
getting $9 million this season and recently exercised an $11 million option for
2001 -- far less than he could have gotten as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every contract signed, everything that gets booked, obviously has an
effect on the marketplace -- some positive, some negative,'' Yankees general
manager Brian Cashman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez, eligible for free agency after the season,
is thought to be the first candidate for a baseball contract averaging $20
million. Rodriguez has ruled out negotiating with the Mariners before becoming a
free agent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The most shocking thing about this contract to me is a player who wants to
win is coming into a market that is financially restricted,'' said Boras,
Rodriguez's agent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He increases the value of the franchise, but there is no reward for him
down the way for what increase in franchise value and revenue he will generate
in the future. I understand the issue of what they can afford today, but when
the stadium comes in and generates all this interest and revenue, is there
anything for the player who is generating the money? I am assuming there's
clauses in the contract that account for that.''
</P>
<P>
	   The final terms of the deal have not yet been confirmed by the
commissioner's office and the players association, so details of any clauses are
not yet known. But the deal does not appear to contain anything other than the
award clauses contained in many contracts.

<HEADLINE> Britain Suspends Belfast Cabinet  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Britain resumed sole control of Northern
Ireland at the stroke of midnight today -- but was hopeful of a quick return of
power to the local Protestant-Catholic administration once the Irish Republican
Army's commitment to disarm becomes clear.
</P>
<P>
	   Hours after Britain decided to re-impose ``direct rule'' of Northern
Ireland, the committee overseeing disarmament made a surprise announcement that
it had made new progress in its latest talks with the IRA.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain's calculation is that suspending the Cabinet will encourage its
major Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, to remain in a coalition that
includes the IRA-linked Sinn Fein party.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ulster Unionists scheduled a conference today to vote on whether to
withdraw from the Cabinet, a move that would trigger its collapse.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I very much regret this course of action,'' said Britain's Northern
Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson, who stripped powers from the four-party
coalition just 72 days after its formation under terms of the Good Friday peace
accord of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The crisis was triggered Jan. 31 when the province's independent disarmament
commission reported that the outlawed IRA had yet to indicate when, if ever, it
would start scrapping its hidden weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ulster Unionists in November accepted an American-brokered deal that
required them to accept Sinn Fein as government colleagues on condition that the
IRA would gradually disarm in response.
</P>
<P>
	   Hopes of a resolution were raised by progress in a surprise second report
published late Friday by the disarmament commission -- just a few hours after
Mandelson's announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said the IRA had spelled out ``the context'' in which the
outlawed group would ``initiate a comprehensive process to put arms beyond use,
in a manner as to ensure maximum public confidence.''
</P>
<P>
	   The commission, led by Canadian Gen. John de Chastelain, said the IRA's
latest position ``holds out the real prospect of an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, President Clinton said this statement represented ``real
progress'' and he hoped all parties would ``build on that progress.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I regret that the IRA did not give the de Chastelain commission a more
timely commitment on arms decommissioning to maintain the momentum toward full
implementation of the accord,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson said he welcomed the IRA's apparent shift as far as it went -- but
that it didn't appear to come close to the British government's requirement for
a clear pledge to disarm. The Good Friday accord empowered de Chastelain to seek
the IRA's total disarmament by May, a goal that looks increasingly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Of course it changes things for the better but it doesn't transform
things,'' said Mandelson, who characterized the IRA's true attitude to
disarmament as still ``shrouded in mist.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson said he required ``a clear commitment by the IRA to decommission
-- we haven't got that commitment yet -- and a suggested time frame within which
this would occur. I think that would open the way for me to rescind the
suspension.''

<HEADLINE> Tiger Comes to Life at Buick Open  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG FERGUSON AP Golf Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Tiger Woods was in this position before.
</P>
<P>
	   In danger of missing the cut in the Buick Invitational, his ball hit a cart
path and bounded 30 yards left of the par-3 11th hole, landing on an old tee
area and leaving a delicate shot to a flag cut just 12 feet from the edge of the
green.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was there last year, when I shot 62 on Saturday," Woods said. "Same shot,
same tee box, same area, same flop shot, same putt."
</P>
<P>
	   Now, if Woods can only get the same results.
</P>
<P>
	   Still struggling with his swing, Woods escaped danger Friday with five
birdies on the back nine and the brilliant par save on the 11th hole for a
4-under 68, leaving him six strokes off the lead, but still very much in the
hunt for his seventh straight PGA Tour victory.
</P>
<P>
	   He could use another 62 today in the third round at Torrey Pines. That's
what Phil Mickelson, tied for the lead with Shigeki Maruyama and Kirk Triplett,
is expecting.
</P>
<P>
	   On what essentially is his home course, in a tournament where he first won
as a pro, Mickelson couldn't help but notice that Woods was still alive in the
Buick Invitational, and so was The Streak.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's kind of given he's going to go low, because he usually does,"
Mickelson said after his 5-under 67 that put him at 133. "He's going to be
playing in front of me. He's going to to have an opportunity to start creeping
up the leaderboard before I tee off.
</P>
<P>
	   "You've got to be aware of that, you've got to expect it to happen and
you've got to be able to counter."
</P>
<P>
	   Mickelson may be the best hope to end golf's longest winning streak in 52
years. Triplett, who went birdie-eagle-birdie-birdie on the back nine of the
South course to roar into contention, has never won on the PGA Tour in 264
previous events.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's one more element you're battling," he said of Woods being in the hunt.
</P>
<P>
	   Maruyama, who went 5-0 in the Presidents Cup, said a victory this week would
send the Japanese golf community into a state of euphoria. Asked whether he was
the one to end The Streak, Maruyama broke into a wide smile.
</P>
<P>
	   "No chance," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods at least has one. A week ago, he was eight strokes behind after 36
holes at Pebble Beach, five behind going into the final round and made up a
7-shot deficit in his final seven holes.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would much rather be 11- or 12-under par right now," Woods said. "It's
just the way it is sometimes. You can't put it together when you want to. It's a
little frustrating, but that's OK. Maybe I can turn it around on the weekend."
</P>
<P>
	   Sandy Lyle, who won the Masters and British Open before Woods was in high
school, was at 134 after a bogey-free 66.
</P>
<P>
	   First-round leader Davis Love III was cruising along on the easier North
course until a double bogey on the par-3 sixth hole wrecked his round. He
finished with a 71 and was three strokes back at 136.
</P>
<P>
	   The last, and only, time Woods missed a cut was in the 1997 Canadian Open,
two weeks before his first Ryder Cup, when he bogeyed the last hole to miss by a
shot.
</P>
<P>
	   The possibility of The Streak coming to such an inauspicious end loomed
large when he failed to make a single birdie on the front nine -- including a
4-footer that never touched the hole at No. 9 -- and was 1-over at the turn.
</P>
<P>
	   Two putts turned it around. He made a 25-footer for birdie on the 10th, then
a 12-foot par save on the par-3 11th after his tee shot hit a cart path and
wound up 30 yards left of the green on an old tee box.
</P>
<P>
	   That seemed to rejuvenate Woods. After a birdie from the greenside bunker on
No. 13, he hit a sand wedge about eight feet past the hole on No. 15 that spun
back and grazed the lip of the cup for an easy tap-in.
</P>
<P>
	   It was on No. 15 at Pebble Beach on Sunday where Woods holed a 97-yard wedge
for eagle that started his amazing comeback for his sixth straight victory.
</P>
<P>
	   As Woods has proven, six shots is nothing to make up in two days. And while
he needed two great rounds at Torrey Pines last year -- 62-65 for 17-under on
the weekend-- just playing well enough to get his name on the leaderboard could
be enough to scare the socks off everyone else.
</P>
<P>
	   "He can obviously turn it on," Mickelson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods did just that on Friday, at just the right time. It didn't win the
tournament, but it gave him a chance to defend his title and keep alive the
streak that everyone is talking about.

<HEADLINE> Focus on the Young at All-Star Game  </HEADLINE>
    By CHRIS SHERIDAN AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Allen Iverson sat in a corner basking in the glory
of his first NBA All-Star appearance, piece upon piece of diamond-encrusted
jewelry draped across his body.
</P>
<P>
	   Kevin Garnett sat 100 feet away, mobbed by a horde eager to hear his
23-year-old wisdom.
</P>
<P>
	   Kobe Bryant shuffled in his seat, eager to get on with his rap album debut
party co-starring supermodel Tyra Banks.
</P>
<P>
	   All around the room Friday on media day at All-Star weekend, the focus was
on the youngsters. There are nine first-time All-Stars in Sunday's game, and
only one 30-year-old starter.
</P>
<P>
	   People could only wonder what Karl Malone would have thought of it.
</P>
<P>
	   Malone was a no-show, choosing to remain at his ranch on the
Arkansas-Louisiana border with his family. There was doubt whether he'd show for
Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm still not sure if he's coming," teammate John Stockton said. "I don't
know what battle he's fighting."
</P>
<P>
	   Vince Carter might have been the busiest All-Star, coming into his first
appearance in the league's showcase event as leading vote-getter among all
players and the heavy favorite to win the slam dunk contest.
</P>
<P>
	   With his mother in tow, his Friday itinerary included taped interviews with
the big networks, an appearance at a school in Oakland, the media session in San
Francisco and a player meeting. His schedule was so tight, in fact, that he
canceled a planned runway appearance at a fashion show put on by players' wives.
</P>
<P>
	   Reggie Miller got a kick out of some of the fashions on display as most of
the All-Star participants gathered in a large hotel ballroom. Baggy jeans and
baggier slacks were the preferred pants of the younger players, while headwear
ranged from Jason Williams' slightly askew yellow Vikings cap to Larry Hughes,
he of the 13 tattoos, wearing a ski cap over a doo-rag over his cornrows.
</P>
<P>
	   "The league is about change," said Alonzo Mourning, who turned 30 just a few
days ago. "They're pushing this new generation to the forefront. I feel like the
old man on the totem pole."
</P>
<P>
	   Malone has expressed a distaste for the way the NBA is promoting its younger
players instead of its veterans.
</P>
<P>
	   He tried to back out of All-Star weekend by claiming he wanted to recover
from nagging injuries. But the league wasn't buying his excuse, and Malone was
facing a possible five-game suspension if he failed to show for Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just hope he shows," said Stockton, who was concerned about the
consequences a five-game suspension would have on the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
	   Malone's agent and Utah owner Larry Miller have said Malone will show up
Sunday, but Malone has said nothing definitive.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's such a huge part of our team, we can't afford to miss him. Regardless
of what his feelings are, he's very important to the league and I hope he comes
and plays," Stockton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryant was the player who furthered Malone's descent into generational
jealousy in the last All-Star game in New York when Malone went to set a pick
for Bryant and the youngster waved him off.
</P>
<P>
	   Malone took it as a blatant act of disrespect from the then-19-year-old
Bryant to one of his elders. He even vowed that he had played in his last
All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryant said he doesn't regret waving off Malone and even joked with him that
he'd do it again during practice today.
</P>
<P>
	   But Malone was expected to miss that, too.
</P>
<P>
	   At 36, Malone is the second-oldest All-Star behind Stockton (37).
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't feel like an old fogey, but an elder statesman? Yes," said Miller,
who at 34 is the fourth-oldest All-Star. "You've got to promote the younger
players because they are the future, and I think Karl has to face the
realization that it's a young man's game, and the league will go on."
</P>
<P>
	   Today's All-Star events begin at 4 p.m. EST with the rookie game featuring
players from the last two rookie classes. Nighttime events include the 3-point
contest, the 2-ball event featuring WNBA players and the dunk contest.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunday's All-Star game starts at 6:38 p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
	   Starting for the East are Iverson, Grant Hill, Carter, Eddie Jones and
Mourning. The Western Conference starters are Shaquille O'Neal, Bryant, Tim
Duncan, Garnett and Jason Kidd.

<HEADLINE> Kwan Third in Short Program  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY WILNER-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Michelle Kwan heard America's female kiddie corps paying
tribute to her. No one would have blamed her if she wondered why.
</P>
<P>
	It was Kwan who should have been doing the praising after Sasha Cohen, a wispy
15-year-old from California, and Sarah Hughes, a graceful 14-year-old from Long
Island, edged her in the short program Friday at the U.S. Figure Skating
Championships. And like the gracious champion she is, Kwan indeed complimented
the youngsters.
</P>
<P>
	``I do see the future, and it's incredible,'' said Kwan, at 19 hardly an
old-timer. ``I can see the great potential and where we're sitting at world
standards and how the U.S. looks against the world.''
</P>
<P>
	Forget the world. Heading into tonight's free skate, Kwan must worry about the
challenge from within her nation's borders. To win her fourth U.S. crown and
third in a row, she will need to outskate the kids.
</P>
<P>
	She knows it.
</P>
<P>
	``My life has definitely changed this year with school and all,'' said the UCLA
freshman. ``I have a lot to juggle.
</P>
<P>
	``When I am on the ice, I have one thing in mind and that's do well and keep
improving. I know I have to keep on top of things and not maintain what I have.
I have to keep on going forward.''
</P>
<P>
	If she doesn't move forward, she'll be dethroned. Cohen and Hughes certainly
are precocious enough to skate past her -- not that they expected it to happen
so soon.
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't really believe I could beat her, she's just so great,'' said
Cohen, who is 4-foot-9, 79 pounds and officially 15 -- but looks, younger.
</P>
<P>
	``That's quite right,'' chimed in veteran coach John Nicks after Cohen's
brilliant, innovative routine to music by Vivaldi and Albanini earned her first
place from five of the nine judges.
</P>
<P>
	``We all knew coming into this competition our wonderful champion Michelle, who
has been supreme and is still best in the world, would be challenged by the
youth of America. It's been a tradition the American ladies champion never rests
easy on the throne. She will be challenged in the next year or two years. But
(there is) nothing like Michelle, your consistency in performance, and all these
young skaters understand it.''
</P>
<P>
	Kwan understands the urgency of her situation, and why she is in it. She was
too confident, too comfortable, for the short, worth one-third of the total
score. She fell on the simplest triple jump, a toe loop, which Kwan hadn't done
in the short in four years.
</P>
<P>
	``I felt so at ease,'' the two-time world champion said. ``I think that I
didn't take my time and rushed right into it.''
</P>
<P>
	Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman rushed past younger skaters to win the pairs
title. It was the third national crown for Ina, who won in 1997 and '98 with
Jason Dungjen, and the first for Zimmerman.
</P>
<P>
	Ina was relieved their routine went so well. The couple has been together only
two years, and it's been an inconsistent ride.
</P>
<P>
	``We are notorious for having weird things happen after a great performance,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
	Nothing weird happened and they are headed for next month's world championships
in Nice, France, along with runners-up Tiffany Scott and Philip Dulebohn.
</P>
<P>
	Cohen might not be heading to worlds even if she wins. She's too young and will
need to medal at junior worlds in three weeks to qualify.
</P>
<P>
	That's not on her mind.
</P>
<P>
	``To be on top is really great, but I really didn't expect to do this well,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in white and looking like a ballerina in a music box, Cohen was magical
from the beginning of her first significant senior event. Combining unusual
strength for someone so small, she displayed marvelous flexibility. From her
triple lutz-double toe combination to a series of exquisite, difficult spirals
to a perfect triple flip, she wowed the crowd and won five judges.
</P>
<P>
	``That's the best short program she's skated in three years,'' Nicks said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Grand Jury Indicts Lewis, 2 Others  </HEADLINE>
    By JAMES PILCHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Police claim that Ray Lewis lied. His lawyer claims he's
being railroaded.
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever the truth, a grand jury indicted Lewis and two associates on murder
charges for the stabbing deaths of two men killed after a Super Bowl party.
</P>
<P>
	   Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard Jr. announced the indictments
Friday, saying Lewis and the other two were involved in a Jan. 31 fight that
left the two victims dead.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis, a three-time Pro Bowl linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens, remains in
the Atlanta Detention Center without bail, charged with the deaths of Richard
Lollar, 24, and Jacinth Baker, 21.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense lawyer Ed Garland said he would prove Lewis' "absolute innocence" at
a Monday bond hearing and called the prosecution's case "dishwater weak."
</P>
<P>
	   "You can almost hear the railroad whistle blowing as it goes down the
track," Garland said. "The first passenger was Richard Jewell -- this time it's
Ray Lewis. At the Olympics there was another innocent person trying to help, but
was in the wrong place at the wrong time. They have just done to Ray Lewis what
they did to Richard Jewell, and history is repeating itself."
</P>
<P>
	   Jewell, a security guard at Centennial Olympic Park at the time of the July
1996 park bombing, was named as a suspect, but later cleared by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
	   Garland said Lewis was not a participant in the fight, but tried to stop it.
</P>
<P>
	   Police say Lewis lied to them about who was in his limousine that morning
and tried to protect his friends.
</P>
<P>
	   Howard would not say if investigators believe Lewis stabbed one of the
victims, but he can be charged with murder if he was involved in the fight --
even if someone else killed the men.
</P>
<P>
	   "He participated by punching, encouraging and assisting in the commission of
this crime," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
	   Five of the victims' family members attended the district attorney's news
conference, and Vondie Boykin, Baker's aunt, read a brief statement.
</P>
<P>
	   "God is a just God and he will see to it that justice is served," she said
as Atlanta police chief Beverly Harvard consoled Baker's cousin Patrice Brown by
holding her hand.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI has issued arrest warrants for the other two suspects, Reginald
Oakley of Baltimore and Joseph Sweeting of Miami. Atlanta police say Lewis lied
to officers to protect the two men.
</P>
<P>
	   Each of the men face six charges including felony murder and aggravated
assault with a deadly weapon. A murder conviction in Georgia brings a sentence
of life in prison or the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   Oakley, 31, and Sweeting, 34, are both being sought on federal charges of
unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. The FBI said they should be considered
armed and dangerous, and mug shots of the two men were released.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are appealing to them to turn themselves in," Harvard said.
</P>
<P>
	   Oakley has been convicted of a number of crimes, including assaulting a
police officer, shooting into an occupied dwelling, trafficking cocaine and
embezzlement, Atlanta deputy police chief C.B. Jackson said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Oakley was evicted from his apartment earlier this year, according to Mike
Zimenski, a spokesman for the apartment building's management company.
</P>
<P>
	   A Baltimore television station reported that a man who claims to be a legal
consultant for Oakley said Friday that Oakley is nothing more than a witness to
the murders. WBAL-TV quoted Jesse Ingram as saying Oakley has agreed to return
to Atlanta and cooperate with police.
</P>
<P>
	   Police in Dade County, Fla., said Sweeting has been charged with robbery,
possession of a firearm by a felon, and carrying a concealed firearm.
</P>
<P>
	   No one answered the telephone Friday at Sweeting's parents' home.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Adapt To Threats  </HEADLINE>
   By RODEINA KENAAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- After the latest Israeli airstrikes, Lebanese are
hooking back up their noisy generators and filling their tubs to conserve water
-- adapting quickly to lives with power cutoffs and the threat of more punishing
raids.
</P>
<P>
	   Beirut has been transformed this week from a city famed for its nightlife to
a place where 1.2 million people cope with blackouts and water shortages, while
shrugging off the roar of Israeli jets overhead and the occasional fire of
anti-aircraft guns.
</P>
<P>
	   In a flare-up of violence this week between Hezbollah guerrillas and Israeli
troops in southern Lebanon, Israeli airstrikes Tuesday destroyed power stations
in Beirut and elsewhere. Parts of the country were plunged into darkness,
forcing the government to impose power cuts of up to 16 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
	   Apprehension then grew after Israeli officials threatened to bring the
battle once again to Beirut if guerrillas fired rockets into northern Israel.
Seven Israeli soldiers have been killed and 15 Lebanese civilians injured in the
past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   American singer Art Garfunkel, of the 1960s duo Simon and Garfunkel,
canceled a Valentine's Day concert in Beirut for security reasons. A
government-sponsored conference to promote Beirut as a media capital was
postponed. Some travelers canceled flights to Lebanon for this month's Shopping
and Tourism Festival.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let's face it. War and tourism don't go together,'' said Pierre Ashkar,
president of the Hotel Owners' Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Lebanon has recovered from such setbacks before. It did so many times during
the 1975-90 civil war. Last June, Israeli warplanes knocked out two power
stations near Beirut, forcing electricity rationing for about four months. In
1996, Israeli planes also hit the Beirut power stations.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel's strategy of hitting infrastructure in an effort to turn the
Lebanese government and public against the guerrillas isn't working this time,
either.
</P>
<P>
	   Publicly, the government backs the guerrillas, who are supported by Iran and
tolerated by Syria, but it does not involve its armed forces in the conflict,
except to fire at Israeli jets.
</P>
<P>
	   People are angry at having to deal with little electricity, hot water, heat
and having to walk up the stairs because the elevators are not working.
</P>
<P>
	   But most blame Israel, and few speak out against the guerrillas, even in
Christian areas where many saw the Israelis as their allies 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Israel hates to see our economy growing. That's why it is targeting our
infrastructure just to see us go down the drain,'' said Walid Shwaifati, a
Christian who owns several clothing and shoe stores across the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Albert Moukhaiber, an anti-Syrian Christian politician and one of the rare
dissenting voices, has criticized the government's handling of the crisis. He
has asked why Syria, which is bound to Lebanon by a friendship treaty and keeps
15,000 troops in the country, does not deploy its air force against the Israeli
planes.
</P>
<P>
	   For Wadad Khalifeh, mother of two girls aged 5 and 7, this past week's
airstrikes meant a shift to another routine.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Don't forget to bring lots of candles and batteries,'' she shouted from
her fifth-floor balcony to her husband in the street below. ``Forget the
potatoes and the oranges. They'll be too heavy for you to carry up the stairs.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the new routine, children do their homework before sundown and laundry is
done at odd hours to use limited periods of electricity and water.
</P>
<P>
	   Some families kept their children away from school for a few days, fearing
more air attacks. Many elderly and those with heart problems changed the times
they went home to avoid having to climb the stairs of high-rise apartment
buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   The blackouts have put neighborhood generator operators back in business,
after some had thought of selling their machines and changing their line of
work. Now they charge hefty fees to feed electricity to homes.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the generally gloomy atmosphere, many Lebanese are confident the
attacks will not have a lasting effect.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This week, Lebanon is a nightmare. Next week, it will be different,'' said
the Lebanese promoter of the Garfunkel show, Naji Bazz.

<HEADLINE> Jet Lands in Phoenix With Problem  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- A TWA jet similar to the type involved in the recent Alaska
Airlines crash experienced hydraulic problems before landing Friday night at Sky
Harbor International Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   The MD-80 landed safely and the 149 people aboard were taken off without any
problems, airport spokeswoman Suzanne Luber said. TWA said Flight 299 was en
route to Phoenix from St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
	   Luber said she didn't know the nature of the problem but that the plane's
pilot had radioed that the jet had hydraulic failure and requested an emergency
landing.
</P>
<P>
	   However, TWA spokesman Jim Brown said ``there was no emergency declared. It
was a minor hydraulic problem.''
</P>
<P>
	   An Alaska Airlines MD-83 crashed Jan. 31 off the coast of California,
killing all 88 people aboard. The Federal Aviation Administration this week
ordered all planes in the MD-80 series inspected.
</P>
<P>
	   Whether the TWA plane had been inspected wasn't immediately known. Also
unclear was the nature of the hydraulics problem.
</P>
<P>
	   Luber and Brown said TWA officials would investigate.

Britain Resumes Control of N. Ireland
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Britain resumed sole control of Northern
Ireland at the stroke of midnight today -- but was hopeful of a quick return of
power to the local Protestant-Catholic administration once the Irish Republican
Army's commitment to disarm becomes clear. Hours after Britain decided to
re-impose "direct rule" of Northern Ireland, the committee overseeing
disarmament made a surprise announcement that it had made new progress in its
latest talks with the IRA. Britain's calculation is that suspending the Cabinet
will encourage its major Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, to remain in a
coalition that includes the IRA-linked Sinn Fein party.

Grozny Refugees Fear of No Return
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SLEPTSOVSKAYA, Russia (AP) -- A push by Russian troops to flush out the last
remaining rebels in Grozny raises little hope among refugees of returning soon.
There is hardly anything to go home to in the ruins of the Chechen capital.
Nearly a week after Russian troops claimed to have the city under control,
Russian authorities appear to have no firm plans on returning the population of
the nearly deserted city. For now, they remain in tent camps near the border.
"In principle, not one important question regarding the refugees has been
decided," said Timirkhan Akiyev, an official in the Migration Service in
Ingushetia, the Russian province on Chechnya's border.

Earth ever produced. "We're ready to map the world," said commander Kevin
Kregel. Just 5 1/2 hours later, the astronauts began extending a 197-foot radar
antenna mast from the shuttle cargo bay. It was a tense job and, by far, the
biggest challenge of the mission. Within 17 minutes, the towerlike mast was all
the way out -- and the longest rigid structure ever deployed in space. "A long

<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Midwest Express Airlines and its pilots agreed on a labor
contract early Saturday, averting a strike after more than a dozen weekend
flights were canceled and workers began picketing.
</P>
<P>
	   "Flights will be resuming as normal tomorrow," said Paul Omodt, a spokesman
for the Air Line Pilots Association. The airline confirmed as much on its Web
site.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal was announced after the strike deadline of 11:01 p.m. CST was
pushed back two hours. No details were released, but union negotiators were
satisfied with the tentative agreement, said Karl Petersen, chairman of the
strike committee.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is satisfying to be recognized by our company as a valuable asset,"
Petersen said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   A ratification vote was expected within a week, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The union has negotiated with Midwest Express for 19 months to establish the
first contract between the two. The National Mediation Board held the talks in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   In preparation for a strike, the airline had canceled 15 flights scheduled
for Friday and Saturday morning. The 200 affected passengers were put on other
flights, airline spokeswoman Lisa Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the announcement, about 30 of the airline's 320 pilots held an
informational picket outside the Midwest Express Center in downtown Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
	   The union held a similar protest at Mitchell International Airport, the
airline's hub. Midwest Express has 130 daily flights to 31 cities, including
Boston, Los Angeles, New York and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
	   According to fliers the demonstrating pilots passed out, final talks hinge
on wages, and pension and health insurance for retirees.
</P>
<P>
	   The union says the average salary for a five-year veteran pilot at Midwest
Express is $86,000, compared with an industry average of $145,000.
</P>
<P>
	   As for retirement benefits, the union says the airline would give retirees
less than 40 percent of their pre-retirement income vs. 58 percent at comparable
airlines. The union also wants the airline to guarantee insurance for retired
pilots.

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Gore Fight Out West  </HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT LINDLAW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Al Gore and Bill Bradley are making personal
pitches to thousands of Democratic activists gathered here as California's
primary race enters its home stretch.
</P>
<P>
	   The candidates planned nearly back-to-back addresses today before more than
3,000 people at the California Democratic Party convention.
</P>
<P>
	   It is a crucial moment for both men, because more nominating delegates are
at stake in California than in any other state, and because the convention-goers
represent the core Democrats who tend to vote in primaries. The election here is
March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These are the kind of people who knock on doors and lick envelopes,''
Democratic National Committee Chairman Joe Andrew said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Clearly, they're very influential, and there's a concentration of media
here that makes the stakes even higher for the candidates,'' Andrew said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, seeking to protect a commanding lead in California polls, courted the
activists at late-night convention appearances Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   He sounded a laundry list of traditional Democratic themes at speeches
before both groups -- the first, a women's caucus, the second, a reception
hosted by Gov. Gray Davis, his most powerful political ally in the state. Each
gathering drew about 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore pledged to maintain affirmative action, fight for civil rights, clean
up the environment, work toward universal health coverage, beef up gun control
laws and help senior citizens buy prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   He received his most boisterous response of the night when he shouted to the
women's group: ``I will fight for a woman's right to choose!''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley must overcome both his deficit in the polls and the strong support
Gore enjoys among top California Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   While the California Democratic Party is officially neutral in the race,
chairman Art Torres openly backs Gore. So do Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne
Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's more familiarity with the vice president,'' Torres said. ``He's
been here whenever we've had a nasty catastrophe, and people trust him.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a Field Poll of likely Democrats released earlier this week, Gore led
Bradley 54 percent to 13 percent, a gap that marked a widening over previous
surveys.
</P>
<P>
	   After his speech this morning, Bradley was headed to Oakland, where he
planned a high school appearance with other ex-NBA stars, including Julius
Irving, Phil Jackson and Bill Russell.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 16 states that will vote on March 7, California offers the biggest
jackpot of delegates -- 367 of the 2,170 needed to clinch the nomination.

<HEADLINE> Special Interests Underwrite Dems  </HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT LINDLAW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Labor, corporate and other special-interest groups
spent tens of thousands of dollars to underwrite the California Democratic Party
convention, where they angled for face time with two presidential candidates,
two senators, the governor and others.
</P>
<P>
	   As party activists began to gather Friday, drug manufacturer Pfizer Inc.
rolled out a banner more than 100 feet wide that was to hang in main convention
hall.
</P>
<P>
	   Three groups of Indians had banners, too, as did Providian Financial Corp.,
which also set up a booth outside the hall. Sempra Energy -- owner of several
California utility companies -- got an ad in the glossy convention brochure seen
by thousands of activists, as did unions representing teachers, state workers
and Northern California carpenters.
</P>
<P>
	   All were convention sponsors.
</P>
<P>
	   While the party declined to release a complete list of them and their
contributions, interviews with the underwriters and Democratic officials found
the cost of admission for about two dozen interest groups ranged from $5,000 to
$25,000. Some paid more, if all donations throughout the year were counted, said
party spokesman Bob Mulholland.
</P>
<P>
	   Sponsorships at party gatherings is a popular way for special interests to
gain exposure to politicians.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, the California Republican Party charged sponsors about the same
as the Democrats -- between $5,000 and $25,000, said GOP spokesman Stuart
DeVeaux.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Democratic gathering, the California Teachers Association and Sempra
said they paid $10,000 each. Voter.com chipped in $25,000.
</P>
<P>
	   In return, the organizations received a variety of benefits, including floor
passes, admission to receptions and hospitality suites, booths, advertisements
in the convention guide, and banners, Mulholland said. The total cost of the
convention was about $250,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   With the special-interest donations and admission fees paid by activists,
the party usually has some money left over for get-out-the-vote and other
activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the special-interest groups dispatched multiple representatives to
the gathering, and they stood a good chance of bumping into officeholders and
candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore, rival candidate Bill Bradley, Sens. Dianne Feinstein
and Barbara Boxer and Gov. Gray Davis all were to attend, along with House
members and state lawmakers and officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Mulholland rejected the notion that the well-heeled interest groups were
buying exposure ordinary citizens cannot. ``Any Democrat can be a delegate here
for 75 bucks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, many of the sponsors said the convention was an opportunity to
heighten awareness of March 7 ballot initiatives that could affect them.
</P>
<P>
	   For the Indians, there is Proposition 1A, which would ratify gambling pacts
signed last year between the state and nearly 60 tribes.
</P>
<P>
	   Teachers' unions were promoting Proposition 26, which would allow local
school bonds to be approved by a simple majority vote instead of two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
	   Other sponsors simply saw the convention as a fertile business environment.
</P>
<P>
	   Craig Smith, director of Democratic outreach for Voter.com, said his
organization viewed the convention as a gathering of likely customers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It made sense to us from a visibility perspective,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Demand U.S. Intervene  </HEADLINE>
   By JASPER MORTIMER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Arab states condemned Israel for its airstrikes on
Lebanon this week, warning of damage to the Mideast peace process and demanding
the United State intervene.
</P>
<P>
	   After Israel's strikes damaged Lebanese power stations, Lebanon's Prime
Minister Salim Hoss urged the United States and France to ``take the necessary
steps to prevent Israel from carrying out new attacks against civilian
targets.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said he was singling out the United States ``because it is the country
that wields the greatest influence on Israel.''
</P>
<P>
	   Washington and Paris head a monitoring committee set up to oversee rules
agreed by all sides in the southern Lebanon conflict to avoid putting civilians
in the crossfire.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria's state-run Damascus radio blamed the United States for the Israeli
raids, which were part of a flare-up of fighting between Lebanese guerrillas and
Israeli forces in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These acts confirm American responsibility because the United States keeps
silent on Israeli crimes,'' the radio said Friday in a commentary. ``Had the
United States not hurried to cover Israel's actions whenever it commits a crime
or a massacre, the Israeli haughtiness would not have risen to this level.''
</P>
<P>
	   Just after Israel began its air offensive Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright accused the Hezbollah guerrillas of attacking Israeli troops
from villages, in violation of an 1996 understanding that prohibits attacks on
or from civilian areas. That echoed Israel's justifications for the strikes on
civilian infrastructure, although Lebanon denied the claim.
</P>
<P>
	   The airstrikes destroyed power stations near Beirut and in the north and
east of the country. At least 15 civilians were wounded in the attacks, which
also blasted numerous suspected guerrilla positions in the south.
</P>
<P>
	   Seven Israeli soldiers have been killed in the last three weeks in southern
Lebanon. On Friday, Israel conducted a 13th straight day of strikes on guerrilla
targets.
</P>
<P>
	   Arab states said a major victim of the airstrikes would be Israel's peace
negotiations with Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
	   Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul-Illah Khatib said Israel's use of military
power was ``poisonous to the region's atmosphere and ... against the peace
process.''
</P>
<P>
	   His Syrian counterpart, Farouq al-Sharaa, warned that Israel's continued
offensive ``will kill any possible chance for peace in the region.''
</P>
<P>
	   There was little doubt that the air raids reduced the chance of an early
resumption of Israeli-Syrian negotiations, which were postponed indefinitely
last month. Lebanon says it will only sit down with the Israelis once the Syrian
talks have made progress.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Palestinian peace track, the fighting in Lebanon took attention from
Sunday's deadline for a framework for a final-status accord, although both sides
had already said they did not expect to meet that target.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Peace is not a gift from Israel to the Arabs, but (Israel) badly needs
peace,'' Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid said in a statement.
He warned Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak that his predecessor, Benjamin
Netanyahu, lost last year's elections because he was not serious about peace.
</P>
<P>
	   In Egypt, there was criticism of Arab governments for failing to do more
than protest Israel's air raids.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today, we mourn the Arab states who stood watching when Lebanon was burned
to the ground,'' a student told a crowd of 1,500 protesters on the campus of the
American University in Cairo. The students, who shouted anti-Israeli slogans and
burned an Israeli flag, were confined to the campus by a cordon of anti-riot
police.

<HEADLINE> Plundered Sicilian gold completes U.S. odyssey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - It was the end of an odyssey spanning two continents -
and it was pure gold.
<P>
	   On Friday, an ancient platter plundered from Sicily in the 1980s came full
circle: It was returned to Italian officials by Manhattan's top federal
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
	   The round, foot-wide "phiale" was used in the 5th century B.C. to
ceremonially offer food to the gods.
</P>
<P>
	   "The gods have a long memory, but so do the carabinieri" - or Italian
police, said U.S. Customs Commissioner Raymond Kelly, praising Italian
investigators who helped trace the journey of the archeological masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
	   Sometime around 1984, the "phiale" was illegally excavated from a protected
site near Palermo, during construction of electrical utility poles.
</P>
<P>
	   It was sold to a Sicilian art collector and in 1991, spirited out of Italy
to a dealer in Zurich, Switzerland. Later that year, Manhattan collector Michael
Steinhardt, a former Wall Street financier, bought the antique for about $1.2
million, more than 10 times the value of its weight of several pounds in pure
gold.
</P>
<P>
	   The treasure arrived at Kennedy Airport, hand-carried on a flight from
Geneva by a Manhattan dealer who acted as intermediary. A customs form gave the
phiale's country of origin as Switzerland and its value at $250,000.
</P>
<P>
	   It was another four years before Italy sought U.S. help in tracking down the
illegally exported art. And in November 1995, customs special agents showed up
at a Fifth Avenue apartment with a seizure warrant issued by the Manhattan
federal prosecutor's office.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is one of the most important cases to ever confront the museum world,"
said Manhattan federal prosecutor Mary Jo White, who was present Friday for the
return of the platter - which she said is essentially "priceless."
</P>
<P>
	   Her office and the U.S. Customs Service had filed a forfeiture complaint and
a Manhattan judge ordered the artifact repatriated; last July, an appeals court
upheld the ruling. Steinhardt, the collector, sought a Supreme Court appeal, but
the nation's highest court declined to hear the case.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, the shimmering gold plate was the star of a news conference in a
skyscraper of Manhattan's World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
	   The Italian consul general in New York, Giorgio Radicati, balanced the
hand-carved gold on his fingers with the flatter side up. That's how the plate
inscribed in Greek was ceremonially used for offerings to the gods in about 450
B.C., when Sicily was ruled by Greece.
</P>
<P>
	   Later Friday, the treasure was packed in a cardboard box for a flight to
Rome, accompanied by an entourage including an Italian magistrate and a major of
the carabinieri police.
</P>
<P>
	   The phiale was on its way home - to a museum in a Sicilian village near
Palermo.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street explosion most likely not linked to terrorists  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Four postal workers on their way to work just before the
sun rose noticed a suspicious device in front of a Wall Street high-rise. A
closer look made them run.
<P>
	   "They spotted a device they immediately identified as a bomb," First Deputy
Police Commissioner Patrick Kelleher said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The workers were able to run about 30 feet when the homemade device,
described by Kelleher as similar to a pipe bomb, exploded at 4:41 a.m. Friday,
breaking windows in two office buildings and slightly injuring one of the postal
workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Terrorism concerns have been ruled out for now.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was nothing to point us to an act of terrorism," Kelleher said at an
afternoon news conference. Earlier in the day, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani also said
the incident did not seem to be terrorist-related.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are exploring all leads, including potential disgruntled employees, or
someone who may have had something against the building," Kelleher said. The
35-story building is located at 75 Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
	   No one had claimed responsibility for it and police believe the explosion
was the act of one man, now wanted by investigators for questioning. An
eyewitness told police he saw the man in the area of the building, perhaps
kneeling down, just minutes before the explosion, Kelleher said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police hope the building's security cameras will provide a picture of the
person responsible, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   The man was described as weighing 200 to 225 pounds, between 5 feet 10
inches and 6 feet tall, with short hair, a light complexion, and a bushy
mustache. He was wearing a tan three-quarters length jacket, with a corduroy
collar and cuffs. The man also had a toolbox and may have been wearing a
knapsack, Kelleher said.
</P>
<P>
	   An $11,000 reward was being offered by the city and Crime Stoppers for
information leading to the arrest and conviction of a suspect or suspects. The
sketch was being circulated in the building in hopes of determining whether one
of its tenants was the target, Kelleher said.
</P>
<P>
	   The explosion "could have killed people," Giuliani said. One postal worker
was treated for ringing in the ears.
</P>
<P>
	   Kelleher said the device - still being examined - was a metal rectangular
container similar to a military ammunition canister.
</P>
<P>
	   "It had cardboard inside it, and black powder was stuffed inside the
cardboard," he said. No nails or other fragments were found inside, and the
device had a "low level force," Kelleher added.
</P>
<P>
	   "It could be classified as similar to a pipe bomb," he said. Police
Commissioner Howard Safir is on vacation this week in Utah and was not available
for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The device blew up in front of an office building owned by Barclays Bank on
the corner of Wall and Water streets, just blocks from the New York Stock
Exchange in the city's Financial District. Windows were blown out in the
building, and at neighboring 95 Wall St.
</P>
<P>
	   In November 1997, a similar incident occurred outside an office tower owned
by Merrill Lynch at 222 Broadway, also in the Wall Street area. A small homemade
bomb exploded shortly before 6 a.m., shattering glass but injuring no one.
</P>
<P>
	   In December 1997, an explosive device exploded in front of Planet Hollywood
at 140 W. 57th St. in midtown Manhattan around 6 a.m. No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Kelleher said so far, police do not see a link between the three incidents.
</P>
<P>
	   Dennis Theodore was working the overnight shift at World Co. LLC, one block
from the blast.
</P>
<P>
	   "The windows shook. The whole building shook," Theodore said. "I thought it
was in my building, or right outside my building. That's how loud it was."
</P>
<P>
	   He went outside to investigate and found "smoke all over the place. ... It
was very scary."
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for Barclays Bank said the company owned the building, but did
not have any offices in it. J.P. Morgan and Dresdner Bank are among the
companies with office space in the building. Barclays released a brief statement
saying there was very minor damage done to the building.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE broker Joseph Muscarella of Navesink, N.J., said the area offered a
high-profile location for anyone seeking to draw attention.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's just a shame that you have to live like this," he said. "But it's just
a part and parcel of what we do. ...Whenever anyone wants to protest anything,
they come to the exchange."
</P>
<P>
	   Some who worked in the area gathered outside on Friday morning, drinking
coffee and chatting on cellular phones, but few seemed worried.
</P>
<P>
	   "I figure if they were actually going to blow something up, they'd aim a
little farther down Wall Street," at the stock exchange, said a man who works in
the building and who identified himself only as Jamie. "I'm kind of surprised
they picked this building."
</P>
<P>
	   Sheikh Drammeh, who works for a finance company across the street, still
views Wall Street as "the best" place to work. "A million bombs will not change
my view about Wall Street and New York City in general."
</P>
<P>
	   The explosion did not affect subway service to the area, though some streets
were closed in the early morning hours. Workers were let inside the two affected
buildings through alternate entrances beginning at about 8:15 a.m. The NYSE also
opened at its usual time.

<HEADLINE> Report: Deutch Recommended Aide  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A former CIA director recommended an agency official join
him at Citibank while she was still monitoring an investigation into whether he
had mishandled classified information, The New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
	   John Deutch resigned as director in December 1996 and was almost immediately
elected to the board of Citibank, the nation's largest. That same month, CIA
officials found evidence Deutch had placed classified information on unsecure
computers at his home but reportedly didn't notify the Justice Department of
potential wrongdoing for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation monitor was Nora Slatkin, the CIA's executive director.
Citing a classified agency report, the Times reported that Slatkin notified the
agency in June 1997 that she was considering a job with Citibank and would
withdraw from consideration of any matters involving the bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet within a month, she reviewed an internal report of findings in the
Deutch investigation, according to the report. Slatkin resigned from the CIA in
September 1997 and joined Citibank as a vice president the next month, the Times
reported.

	   The agency's inspector general has found that Slatkin's actions delayed ``a

	   In a statement, Slatkin said she had excused herself from the Deutch
investigation and that she only helped keep information flowing in the case.

referred to Citibank by Deutch as she was considering where to move after
leaving the agency.

Citibank matter. The Justice Department decided last spring not to prosecute
Deutch.

<HEADLINE> Indian Land Deal Headed to Congress  </HEADLINE>
   By LEON DROUIN KEITH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LA VERNE, Calif. (AP) -- A deal poised to become one of the biggest federal
returns of Indian land in U.S. history now awaits Congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah, federal and tribal officials signed an agreement on Friday that would
return 84,000 acres to the Northern Ute tribe as part of a deal to clean up
millions of tons of uranium waste leaking into the Colorado River. Federal
officials announced the pact in January.
</P>
<P>
	   No immediate health risk has been identified for 25 million water users in
Arizona, California, Nevada and Utah. But Southern California water officials
say there is enough long-term potential risk to remove the 40-foot-high,
150-acre pile.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It makes a whole lot more sense to just keep it out,'' said Phillip Pace,
chairman of the Metropolitan Water District's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement was signed on Friday at a water plant 25 miles east of Los
Angeles because water district officials had lobbied heavily to remove the pile
after the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued a plan to drain and cap the
tailings on site.
</P>
<P>
	   The land, believed to contain oil-rich shale deposits, was given to the Utes
in 1882. But in 1916, on the eve of the nation's entry into World War I, the
federal government took it back to create a reserve supply of oil for the Navy
fleet. The reserve was never tapped.
</P>
<P>
	   The tailings are the byproduct of a mine that operated from 1956 to 1984.
More than 57,600 gallons of water leach every year from the tailings, releasing
high levels of uranium and other pollutants, according to federal studies.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the agreement, half of the estimated $300 million cleanup costs will
be absorbed by the federal government because more than 50 percent of the
uranium mined there was used in weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The Utes will pay an estimated $80 million to $100 million toward the
cleanup and provide added protection to the 75 miles of the Green River that
form the reservation's western boundary.

<HEADLINE> Report: Co. To Pay in Fen-Phen Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    HOUSTON (AP) -- American Home Products has agreed to pay $8 million to $9
million to a Houston woman in what could be the largest settlement to date for
any individual claiming harm by the fen-phen diet drug combination, the Houston
Chronicle reported today.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal was reached Friday, the newspaper reported, citing an unidentified
source. Attorneys and the company both declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia Brinkley, 55, had to have two heart valves replaced with artificial
valves and was facing a third replacement, allegedly because of side effects
from the drugs. Her case was to go to trial on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   John O'Quinn, her attorney, said Brinkley began taking fen-phen in 1995 to
lose weight and treat an acid reflux problem. Her heart valve problems were
diagnosed a year later.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home made the "fen" in fen-phen, a drug called fenfluramine. It
sold the drug under the brand name Pondimin along with a chemical cousin called
Redux.
</P>
<P>
	   The company pulled Pondimin and Redux off the market in 1997 after a Mayo
Clinic study linked fenfluramine to potentially fatal heart valve damage.
Phentermine hasn't been linked to problems when taken alone. It is made by
another company and is still on the market.
</P>
<P>
	   In October, Madison, N.J.-based American Home Products announced it would
pay $4.8 billion to settle fen-phen lawsuits. However, attorneys representing
thousands of fen-phen users said they won't participate in the settlement.

<HEADLINE> Midwest Express Averts Strike  </HEADLINE>
    By SARAH WYATT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Pilots for Midwest Express Airlines celebrated today after
reaching a tentative agreement with airline management that averted a strike
over the terms of their first labor contract.
</P>
<P>
	   Details were not released, but union strike committee chairman Karl Petersen
said the deal provides pilots with enhanced compensation, retiree health
insurance and a retirement plan "that will protect and enhance the careers of
our pilots."
</P>
<P>
	   Airline officials canceled 15 flights late Friday and early today in
preparation for a potential strike. Airline spokeswoman Lisa Bailey said flights
were expected to resume as scheduled today.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're extremely pleased. The customers are No. 1 and we wanted to make sure
we could continue serving the customers," Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
	   Midwest Express, which has its headquarters in Milwaukee, has 130 daily
flights to 31 cities, including Boston, Los Angeles, New York and Philadelphia.
Labor talks involving the company and the Air Line Pilots Association have gone
in for 19 months.
</P>
<P>
	   The union said key issues included wages, and pension and health insurance
for retirees.
</P>
<P>
	   The union said the average salary for a five-year veteran pilot at Midwest
Express is $86,000, compared with an industry average of $145,000. It also said
current airline policy gives retirees less than 40 percent of their
pre-retirement income, compared with 58 percent at comparable airlines. Union
officials also wanted the airline to guarantee insurance for retired pilots.
</P>
<P>
	   Union spokesman Paul Omodt said a ratification vote on the proposed contract
could come in four to five days.
</P>
<P>
	   "There were a lot of people hugging, giving high-fives, shaking hands. But
we were relieved. No one wanted to strike," Omodt said. "The pilots want to stay
here, frankly. They want to make this a career airline."

<HEADLINE> President Proposes Family Leave  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Recalling his own mother's struggle as a widow with a
family, President Clinton today proposed spending $20 million to study new ways
for states to offer paid leave for working parents.
</P>
<P>
	   If approved by Congress in the next budget, the money would underwrite
studies and test projects nationwide. Clinton said he also wants the Family and
Medical Leave Act expanded to benefit 10 million employees of small companies
who are now not covered by the law he signed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've often wondered how my own mother, when she was a young widow, would
have been able to go away to train as a nurse if my grandparents hadn't been
there to take care of me,'' Clinton said in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My mother and I were lucky. So were many other American families. But none
of our families should have to rely on luck alone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said the family leave law, which guarantees up to 12 weeks off
without pay to care for a new child or needy family member, has been good for
workers and families.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everywhere I go, people come up to me and tell me how much this law has
meant to their lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration says 20 million Americans have taken advantage of the
law, and that in 85 percent of cases the leave cost employers nothing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In fact, in many cases it has actually helped save them money by cutting
down on turnover and reducing the expense of training new workers,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Judith Lichtman, president of the National Partnership for Women and
Families, welcomed the opportunity for states to expand the leave program.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At a time when we have such a strong economy, and working families need
relief so urgently, this initiative is a major step forward that can make a real
difference to millions of Americans,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, Clinton announced plans to allow states to pay unemployment
benefits to new parents. Four states are testing the feasibility of doing so.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Asked To Sign Marriage Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID HO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's threat to veto Republican-sponsored
tax relief for married couples shows that he doesn't trust Americans to keep
what they earn, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``On behalf of these families, I ask President Clinton to sign the Marriage
Penalty Relief when it reaches his desk,'' Bush said in the weekly Republican
radio address. ``Eliminating the marriage penalty makes sense and will help
restore fairness to the federal tax code.''
</P>
<P>
	   The House passed the Republican marriage bill Thursday, 268-158, short of
the two-thirds margin needed to override a possible veto by Clinton, who has
complained about the legislation's cost and timing.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill would cut income taxes by $182 billion over 10 years for all
married taxpayers, including the 25 million couples who pay a ``marriage
penalty'' compared with single people filing separately.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said that more than 1 million of those couples live in Florida and that
last year he advocated the largest tax cut in his state's history -- over $1
billion in tax relief for seniors, small business and working families.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Republican governors across the nation have showed their trust for
families by providing tax relief and more educational choice. While Bush made no
mention of his brother, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, he did single out governors
from Pennsylvania and Wisconsin for their work on education reform.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Through more charter schools and more educational choice, parents will
have greater ability to select the best educational environment for their
children,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   While criticizing the president for his veto threat, Bush did mention one of
Clinton's role models, President John F. Kennedy. He quoted Kennedy's famous
statement about going to the moon and compared it to the challenge Americans now
face.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have learned that it is not a task for the timid,'' Bush said. ``So,
too, should we dream big dreams and dare to pursue them.''

<HEADLINE> Hijacked Plane Crew Details Escape  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BARR Associated Press Wrter
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- The crew of a hijacked Afghan airliner decided to escape
after despairing of persuading their captors to surrender, a flight captain said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers had taken over the Ariana jet early Sunday during what should
have been a short domestic flight from the Afghan capital of Kabul to the
northern town of Mazar-e-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
	   The four members of the flight crew, who say they all want to return to
Afghanistan, talked with reporters two days after the hijackers surrendered at
Stansted airport, north of London.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the passengers from the flight were preparing to move to an
immigration center in western England on Saturday, the government said. Some 74
of them have applied for asylum, and police are questioning 22 others who are
suspected of involvement in the hijacking.
</P>
<P>
	   By the time the crew scrambled out a cockpit window Tuesday night, it had
spent nearly two full days with the hijackers and had been unable to persuade
them to give up, said Nabi, the second captain on the flight.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Finally, we saw we could not do anything. We thought if we escaped, the
hijackers would be stranded and probably would not dare to harm any
passengers,'' Nabi said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the worst moment for the crew came Monday morning at daybreak, when
the hijackers first saw that the aircraft was surrounded by armed security
personnel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They became very hysterical and very nervous,'' and threatened to kill
some of the passengers, Nabi said. He did not say how calm was restored.
</P>
<P>
	   Police have said that the hijackers also became extremely agitated after
discovering the crew had escaped. One flight attendant bore the brunt of their
wrath and was shoved down the back stairs of the Boeing 727.
</P>
<P>
	   Said Mehdi Saidi, the first captain, said the crew did not attempt to resist
the hijackers when they first took over the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The hijackers entered the aircraft cockpit and rushed inside with pistols
and very bad faces,'' he said. ``The crew told them: 'Don't do anything please.
What is your command? We will follow your command.'''
</P>
<P>
	   A planed chartered by the Geneva-based International Organization for
Migration was waiting Saturday at an air force base to return any passengers who
wished to go home.

<HEADLINE> Budget Gridlock Likely This Year  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress has begun dissecting President Clinton's fiscal
2001 budget, a $1.84 trillion proposal he introduced last week to negative
Republican reviews. A guide to the likely twists and turns of this election
year's budget battle:
</P>
<P>
	   Q: What happens next?
</P>
<P>
	   A: Republicans who control the House and Senate will write their own budget
for next year, a broad blueprint that plans tax and spending policy but makes no
actual changes in the law. Republicans hope to complete the budget in March --
weeks earlier than usual. Accelerating the congressional work schedule would
allow lawmakers to head home early to campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress will alter tax and spending law later, when it writes 13 separate
bills financing federal agencies, plus other legislation cutting taxes and
perhaps changing some benefit programs. For example, lawmakers are likely to
work on a prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients.
</P>
<P>
	   Q: Are Republicans close to writing their budget?
</P>
<P>
	   A: Not yet. They disagree internally over how much to spend for the
one-third of the budget that Congress controls every year, covering all federal
programs but automatic benefits like Social Security. That figure is key because
it helps determine the size of the surplus, and therefore how much money will be
available for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   Q: What are the chief disputes between Republicans and Democrats?
</P>
<P>
	   A: The big fight is over how to use enormous federal surpluses projected
through the next decade.
</P>
<P>
	   Arguing that now is the time to invest in education, health care and other
programs, Clinton favors higher spending and smaller tax cuts than the GOP
prefers. Republicans want extra funds for selected programs like education and
defense but emphasize tax cuts, saying the government's excess money should be
returned to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   They also disagree over how big surpluses will be. Clinton says it will be
$746 billion through 2010, excluding Social Security money that the parties
agree should go for debt reduction. Republicans have yet to produce their own
surplus estimate. Because Republicans want lower spending than Clinton, they are
certain to say the surplus will be hundreds of billions bigger than the
president's figure.
</P>
<P>
	   Q: Can't they compromise?
</P>
<P>
	   A: Eventually, they will in some areas. By year's end, Congress doubtlessly
will approve several billion dollars more in spending than Republicans will
initially propose for schools, conservation and other domestic programs, and
probably more than Clinton requested for defense.
</P>
<P>
	   There also should be agreement on some minor tax cuts, perhaps raising the
amount of money senior citizens can earn without losing Social Security
benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   Deals are also possible -- but could be tough to strike -- on prescription
drug benefits and easing the ``marriage penalty,'' the tax code quirk that
requires millions of married couples to pay higher taxes than they would if they
were single.
</P>
<P>
	   Q: Both sides say they favor action on prescription drugs and the marriage
penalty. Why is agreement there difficult?
</P>
<P>
	   A: Because of political and philosophical differences. Democrats prefer a
more generous prescription drug benefit than Republicans, while the GOP wants
marriage penalty relief to be deeper and affect more people than Clinton wants.
Though federal surpluses abound, every dollar used for a tax cut is one less
dollar available for spending, making each side reluctant to give in.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Democrats believe failure to enact a prescription drug program would be
a wonderful issue to use against Republicans in the upcoming elections. At the
same time, many in the GOP would be thrilled to blame Democrats for stalemate on
the marriage penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   Q: Any chance for overhauling Medicare and Social Security, the giant health
care and pension programs for the elderly and disabled, for the coming
retirement of the baby boomers?
</P>
<P>
	   A: Virtually none. To do that would mean reducing the programs' benefits or
boosting the payroll taxes that pay for them, enormously controversial ideas
that the politicians studiously will avoid in an election year.
</P>
<P>
	   Q: What about both parties plans to ``save'' and ``protect'' the two
programs this year?
</P>
<P>
	   A: Do not be fooled. What they really are doing is using the surplus -- most
of it generated by Social Security -- to reduce the national debt. Doing that
should strengthen the economy, which should help the government raise the
revenue it will need in the future to pay the baby boomers' Social Security and
Medicare benefits. But that is indirect. Neither party seriously is pursuing the
benefit cuts or tax increases that most analysts say are needed to keep both
programs solvent.
</P>
<P>
	   Q: So another year of gridlock. Is that bad?
</P>
<P>
	   A: Not completely. With each side likely to block the bulk of the other's
plans for spending and taxes, that means most of the 2001 surplus -- likely to
exceed $170 billion -- will go for debt reduction, a plus for the economy.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Adapt To Threats, Blackouts  </HEADLINE>
   By RODEINA KENAAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- After the latest Israeli airstrikes, Lebanese are
hooking back up their noisy generators and filling their tubs to conserve water
-- adapting quickly to lives with power cutoffs and the threat of more punishing
raids.
</P>
<P>
	   Beirut has been transformed this week from a city famed for its nightlife to
a place where 1.2 million people cope with blackouts and water shortages, while
shrugging off the roar of Israeli jets overhead and the occasional fire of
anti-aircraft guns.
</P>
<P>
	   In a flare-up of violence this week between Hezbollah guerrillas and Israeli
troops in southern Lebanon, Israeli airstrikes Tuesday destroyed power stations
in Beirut and elsewhere. Parts of the country were plunged into darkness,
forcing the government to impose power cuts of up to 16 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
	   Apprehension then grew after Israeli officials threatened to bring the
battle once again to Beirut if guerrillas fired rockets into northern Israel.
Seven Israeli soldiers have been killed and 15 Lebanese civilians injured in the
past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   American singer Art Garfunkel, of the 1960s duo Simon and Garfunkel,
canceled a Valentine's Day concert in Beirut for security reasons. A
government-sponsored conference to promote Beirut as a media capital was
postponed. Some travelers canceled flights to Lebanon for this month's Shopping
and Tourism Festival.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let's face it. War and tourism don't go together,'' said Pierre Ashkar,
president of the Hotel Owners' Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Lebanon has recovered from such setbacks before. It did so many times during
the 1975-90 civil war. Last June, Israeli warplanes knocked out two power
stations near Beirut, forcing electricity rationing for about four months. In
1996, Israeli planes also hit the Beirut power stations.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel's strategy of hitting infrastructure in an effort to turn the
Lebanese government and public against the guerrillas isn't working this time,
either.
</P>
<P>
	   Publicly, the government backs the guerrillas, who are supported by Iran and
tolerated by Syria, but it does not involve its armed forces in the conflict,
except to fire at Israeli jets.
</P>
<P>
	   People are angry at having to deal with little electricity, hot water, heat
and having to walk up the stairs because the elevators are not working.
</P>
<P>
	   But most blame Israel, and few speak out against the guerrillas, even in
Christian areas where many saw the Israelis as their allies 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Israel hates to see our economy growing. That's why it is targeting our
infrastructure just to see us go down the drain,'' said Walid Shwaifati, a
Christian who owns several clothing and shoe stores across the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Albert Moukhaiber, an anti-Syrian Christian politician and one of the rare
dissenting voices, has criticized the government's handling of the crisis. He
has asked why Syria, which is bound to Lebanon by a friendship treaty and keeps
15,000 troops in the country, does not deploy its air force against the Israeli
planes.
</P>
<P>
	   For Wadad Khalifeh, mother of two girls aged 5 and 7, this past week's
airstrikes meant a shift to another routine.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Don't forget to bring lots of candles and batteries,'' she shouted from
her fifth-floor balcony to her husband in the street below. ``Forget the
potatoes and the oranges. They'll be too heavy for you to carry up the stairs.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the new routine, children do their homework before sundown and laundry is
done at odd hours to use limited periods of electricity and water.
</P>
<P>
	   Some families kept their children away from school for a few days, fearing
more air attacks. Many elderly and those with heart problems changed the times
they went home to avoid having to climb the stairs of high-rise apartment
buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   The blackouts have put neighborhood generator operators back in business,
after some had thought of selling their machines and changing their line of
work. Now they charge hefty fees to feed electricity to homes.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the generally gloomy atmosphere, many Lebanese are confident the
attacks will not have a lasting effect.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This week, Lebanon is a nightmare. Next week, it will be different,'' said
the Lebanese promoter of the Garfunkel show, Naji Bazz.

<HEADLINE> Festive Crowd Protests Austria Govt.  </HEADLINE>
   By MELISSA EDDY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Vienna's streets took on a carnival atmosphere
Saturday as Austrians continued their peaceful protests against the new
government inaugurated last week.
</P>
<P>
	   The appointment of the government, which includes the right-wing Freedom
Party of Joerg Haider, has generated a wave of protest in Austria and abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day 2,000 Austrians held a peaceful demonstration in the
western city of Innsbruck; 3,000 demonstrated in Linz, about 75 miles west of
Vienna; and 400 protested in Feldkirch, on the Austrian-Swiss border, the
Austrian Press Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Around 2,000 people representing different political and interest groups
gathered at Vienna's main railway station in the early afternoon for a march
down one of the city's busiest shopping streets.
</P>
<P>
	   By the time the march had reached the parliament building, the crowd had
swelled to about 5,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to organizers' requests for peaceful demonstrations, protesters
carried banners, European Union flags and made noise with pots and pans,
whistles, drums and shakers.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowd included parents carrying children and foreigners living in
Austria.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the marchers, a 28-year-old musician who would give only his first
name, Helmut, said he approved of the diplomatic measures taken by the European
Union and Israel against the new government.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Detainee Returns From China  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- An American woman arrived in Detroit today after being freed
from custody in China, where she was detained for taking a picture at a protest
by the banned Falun Gong meditation group.
</P>
<P>
	   Police had put Tracy Zhao, 30, on the Northwest Airlines flight to Detroit,
where she was trying to find a flight back to her home in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Embassy declined comment, saying that because the Chinese had
allowed no consular access, officials had not obtained a privacy waiver from
Zhao.
</P>
<P>
	   Zhao, a Northwest Airlines flight attendant, was taking a picture of police
breaking up a Falun Gong protest around midnight Feb. 4 at Tiananmen Square when
police detained her.
</P>
<P>
	   According to her boyfriend, Lin Chong-i, she did not join the protest but
was there to observe it and show support. She was among at least 50 Falun Gong
followers detained at the protest, which was held as China welcomed the lunar
new year. Police kicked, punched and dragged many of the demonstrators before
putting them in vans and driving them away.
</P>
<P>
	   Zhao, who was born in Beijing, emigrated to the United States at age 20. She
had been practicing Falun Gong for about a year, according to her mother, Yan
Zuo. Zhao was visiting Beijing to celebrate the lunar new year and to find out
how Falun Gong members in China were being treated, Yan said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chinese government banned Falun Gong in July as a menace to the public
and a threat to Communist Party control. Founded in 1992 by a former Chinese
government clerk who now lives in New York, Falun Gong attracted millions of
followers drawn to its mix of slow-motion exercises, Buddhist and Taoist
cosmology and message of moral living.
</P>
<P>
	   Protests by members persist despite a crackdown that has seen thousands sent
to labor camps and top group leaders sentenced to prison terms of up to 18
years.

<HEADLINE> Europe's Response Gives Haider Boost  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   An AP News Analysis By ROBERT H. REID Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- International measures to punish Austria for handing
power to a far-right party may have backfired, giving an unwitting boost to the
party's leader and threatening the European Union's ability to conduct business
as usual.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of weakening Freedom Party leader Joerg Haider, who holds no
official government post, the furor has undermined support for the country's
moderate chancellor, Wolfgang Schuessel, whose presence at the top offers a
counterbalance to the right-wing party.
</P>
<P>
	   Surveys show Schuessel's popularity with the Austrian electorate has
suffered more than Haider's. As the head of government, Schuessel will likely
take the flack when the new administration tries to push through budget-cutting
measures including cutbacks in the civil service and increases in the retirement
age.
</P>
<P>
	   The new coalition led by Haider, governor of Carinthia province, and
Schuessel, head of the moderate Austrian People's Party, took office Feb. 4.
Since then, the 14 other EU members suspended high-level diplomatic contacts
with Vienna to show their revulsion over Haider's Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
	   The outrage stemmed from Haider's opposition to immigration and rapid EU
expansion, as well as previous statements praising Waffen SS veterans and
lauding Adolf Hitler's ``orderly'' employment program.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Austrians, including those who oppose the Freedom Party, do not
consider Haider a neo-Nazi. Instead, his critics dismiss him a brash opportunist
and rabble-rouser.
</P>
<P>
	   His supporters say his only crime has been to challenge the clubby Austrian
political establishment, which they say is more anxious to reach out to Eastern
Europe's former communist countries than to address the concerns of ordinary
Austrians fearful of losing jobs in a world of economic globalization and EU
expansion.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Austrians, therefore, consider the international reaction to be
exaggerated. According to a survey of 500 Austrians published Saturday in the
newspaper Die Presse, 73 percent oppose diplomatic measures against their
country.
</P>
<P>
	   The survey, which gave no margin of error, found that the opposition cuts
across party lines. Among voters who support the center-left Social Democratic
Party, which headed the previous coalition and is strongly anti-Haider, 64
percent opposed measures to isolate Austria.
</P>
<P>
	   Austrians reacted in a similar manner during the country's diplomatic
isolation during the presidency of former U.N. secretary-general Kurt Waldheim,
who sought to conceal his activities in the German army during the Nazi era.
</P>
<P>
	   Such measures against the relatively small country of 7.8 million by EU
heavyweights such as France and Germany have wounded national pride and stirred
resentment.
</P>
<P>
	   In a radio interview Saturday, Schuessel said that ``in the case of a big
country, the reactions would have been completely different. No one would have
dared.''
</P>
<P>
	   Former vice chancellor Erhard Busek, a member of the People's Party, said
the reaction of the other EU states will serve only to boost Haider's appeal
among Austrians suffering wounded national pride.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The current inclination to brand Austria as the `Cuba of the EU' is not
helpful,'' Busek wrote in the Sueddeutsche Zeitung of Munich, Germany. Better,
he said, to hold Haider accountable for his actions and statements so he ``can
fall prey to meaninglessness, through which he will try to escape through clever
comments to the media.''
</P>
<P>
	   More serious is the impact of the diplomatic isolation on the rest of the
EU. Austria retains its EU membership, and its ministers can attend EU
ministerial meetings, such as one held Friday in Lisbon, Portugal.
</P>
<P>
	   When the Austrian spoke, however, the French and Belgian delegations walked
out. The Austrian, Elisabeth Sickl of the Freedom Party, was shunned. Instead of
addressing items on the agenda, speakers denounced the rise of right-wing
politics in Austria.
</P>
<P>
	   That raises questions about whether the EU can conduct its business while at
the same time allowing Austria a seat at the table.

<HEADLINE> Poor Nations Seek Share of Wealth  </HEADLINE>
    By DIRK BEVERIDGE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Economic globalization may be inevitable, but the
leaders of poor nations told an international trade conference Saturday that it
holds painful and frightening downsides for their countries.
</P>
<P>
	   The weeklong U.N. Conference on Trade and Development, which started
Saturday, was being touted as a place for trade officials to pick up where they
left off in December in Seattle, where street protests turned violent and World
Trade Organization ministers failed to launch a new round of global commerce
talks.
</P>
<P>
	   About 1,000 people -- including veterans of the Seattle protests --
demonstrated in Bangkok on Saturday, but they were subdued and peaceful.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. meeting, held every four years, focuses more on the developing
world and a feeling among many of its leaders that they cannot access wealth
created by a global system centered on high technology and increased power by
multinational corporations.
</P>
<P>
	   Such corporations -- some already financially more powerful than
medium-sized countries -- will keep getting bigger through mergers and
acquisitions, warned Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.

<HEADLINE> Peaceful Protest at UN Trade Meeting  </HEADLINE>
    By BUSABA SIVASOMBOON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Hundreds of police braced for a repeat of the
violent protests that plunged Seattle into chaos last December were greeted
instead by only a few minutes of pushing Saturday at the opening of an
international trade conference in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the 1,000 demonstrators at the first day of the weeklong U.N.
Conference on Trade and Development were poor farmers from the Thai countryside
who sat down in a major intersection after police blocked them from coming down
the street to the convention center.
</P>
<P>
	   Protests got so out of hand at the World Trade Organization meeting last
year that the National Guard was called in and a curfew was imposed. There was
more than $2 million in property damage.
</P>
<P>
	   The brief shoving match was the only disturbance Saturday as a mixed bag of
demonstrators came to voice their concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   From the environment to the economy, from local to international, the
diversity of issues was evident on the banners they carried: "Save the Moon
River Watershed," "No Sanction Iraq," "Stop Trade with Dictatorial Regimes."
</P>
<P>
	   But issues of trade and globalization were the main focus, reflected in the
banner at the front of the crowd that told the WTO, the International Monetary
Fund, the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank to "Go to hell."
</P>
<P>
	   "We need no trade liberalization if we -- poor people -- have to sacrifice
so much when the rich become richer and richer," said Bamroong Khayotha, a
leader of the group Assembly of the Poor.
</P>
<P>
	   One group of women from a garment factory made a halfhearted attempt to push
its way in, but was blocked by a line of unarmed police. Eventually, a few
hundred were allowed to proceed to the street opposite the convention center,
where a conference official came out to meet them.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are all friends -- police and the poor," said Police Col. Pramote
Prathumwong. "We try our best to avoid violence: when they come in peace, they
should be treated in the same manner."
</P>
<P>
	   Among the foreign activists was Patricia Alonso, of Mexico, who came with a
network of organizations working to keep agriculture from coming under WTO
rules.
</P>
<P>
	   "These issues should not be in the hands of the powerful, these are issues
that belong to us," she told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   Awni Behnem, secretary of the conference, said that UNCTAD shares the
concerns of developing countries for a better future and greater opportunities
for their people: "Your cause is our cause."

<HEADLINE> Duck Statues Stolen From Moscow Park  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Strollers in a Moscow park found the statues of a mother
mallard and her babies to be charming, but to thieves they were just sitting
ducks.
</P>
<P>
	   The bronze statues of the mother and two of the seven ducklings trailing
single-file behind her have been sawed off at the legs and spirited away from
Novodevichy Park. The theft occurred on Feb. 6, the Moscow Times newspaper cited
police spokesman Vladimir Zubkov as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   The statues are replicas of statues in the Boston Public Garden and portray
the characters from ``Make Way for Ducklings,'' a children's book popular for
generations in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The book tells of the travails of a mallard family looking for a new home in
the midst of a noisy city. The Moscow park, adjacent to the Novodevichy convent
and cemetery that are among the capital's top tourist destinations, is an area
of calm amid the central city's clamor.
</P>
<P>
	   The Moscow statues were presented in 1991 by Barbara Bush, the wife of
then-President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Zubkov, the police spokesman, said he was ``heartbroken'' and officers are
investigating the theft, the newspaper reported Friday.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- A former Miss America has gotten her big break on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
	   Miss America 1998 Kate Shindle has been the understudy for the lead female
role in the musical "Jekyll &AMP; Hyde" since the beginning of the year. She had
been waiting tables at Artie's, a delicatessen at 82nd and Broadway, but quit
when she landed a part in the show's chorus after auditioning in December.
</P>
<P>
	   Shindle, 23, took the stage as a star for the first time Wednesday after
Coleen Sexton, who normally plays the part of Lucy, a doomed prostitute, called
out sick.
</P>
<P>
	   The former Miss Illinois told the New York Post her Miss America title and
the publicity about her waitressing job probably helped jumpstart her acting
career.
</P>
<P>
	   "It provided the entry spark," she said. "But I'm not so jaded as to think
that it's the only reason I got the part. They put me through the paces at the
audition."

   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) -- Prince Rainier of Monaco has undergone a second
lung operation after doctors found air building up in his chest cavity.
</P>
<P>
	   The condition, known as pneumothorax, can cause partial or complete collapse
of the lung if left untreated.
</P>
<P>
	   The prince's medical team issued a statement saying the operation, which
started shortly after midnight Friday, had been carried out ``in good
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second lung operation for the 76-year-old prince in as many
weeks. Rainier was already in the hospital recovering from an operation Feb. 2
when doctors removed part of his lung in order to examine a small nodular
growth.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors said the growth was discovered during routine testing in December
and that it is no cause for alarm. They have not said whether it was cancerous.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Advocates for Africa Urge Change  </HEADLINE>
   By PAULINE JELINEK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Advocates for Africa are meeting this week to emphasize
the positive about the continent and change Americans' views of -- and their
government's policies on -- its impoverished and war-torn nations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The philosophy is ... that the glass is half full, not half empty,'' said
Leonard Robinson, president of the National Summit on Africa. A former assistant
U.S. secretary of state, Robinson is among those arguing for greater trade, aid,
cultural exchanges and other programs for Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   It's hard for many to see it that way.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Americans and Europeans will get together, talk and feel good -- and not a
... thing will happen for Africa,'' says Walter Williams, head of the economics
department at George Mason University in Virginia. ``This stuff is for domestic
consumption.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the summit, Robinson will preside over a five-day meeting of an estimated
5,000 people starting Wednesday. Selected delegates will vote, essentially, on
what the United States should be doing on the 54-nation continent.
</P>
<P>
	   The effort, funded by the Carnegie Foundation, Ford Foundation, businesses
and others, has been in the making since late 1996 and has three main goals:
</P>
<P>
	   Summit organizers want:
</P>
<P>
	   --Unify and strengthen what organizers say has been a weak and sometimes
at-odds-with-itself lobby for Africa in America. They point to an American
Jewish lobby they say has been effective in shaping U.S.-Israeli policy.
</P>
<P>
	   --Improve Africa's image in the states, where they say the media have
focused too much on the negative.
</P>
<P>
	   --Get the U.S. government to change its policy toward Africa, a continent
they say has been either ignored or mishandled over the decades.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to ensure that policy-makers accept the reality that Africa
matters,'' said Robinson. ``We want to create an atmosphere where Africa will be
respected and treated with equity, not automatically relegated to the back
burner of U.S. foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
	   The goals echo some of the ideas of President Clinton, scheduled to speak to
the summit Thursday. Others invited include current or former presidents of
South Africa, France and Kenya as well as officials from the United Nations and
the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has promoted, with only limited success, a greater partnership with
Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   House and Senate leaders hope to pass an African trade bill by next month,
the first major trade bill in five years. The legislation primarily would cut
tariffs on imported African clothing and promote U.S. sales and investment on
the continent.
</P>
<P>
	   Summit organizers are trying to get leading U.S. presidential candidates to
speak about their prospective policies toward Africa. They and some black
American leaders say the Clinton administration has paid more attention to
Africa than any other White House in years. They want to ensure that after he
leaves office, that policy not only will continue but be expanded.
</P>
<P>
	   To that end, they have produced a plan of action for U.S. African policy
that will be completed Sunday and will be sent to Congress, administration
officials and leaders of American civil, social and religious organizations as
well as city mayors, Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics doubt it will do much good.
</P>
<P>
	   Where summit organizers see an Africa with three of the four fastest-growing
economies in the world, a continent making progress toward democracy, critics of
the summit see an Africa that remains ``a basket case,'' said George Mason
economist Williams.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that except for a handful of nations making some headway with their
economies, ``I wouldn't invest a dime in any country in Africa.'' Most African
nations still lack the rule of law, respect for contracts and other essentials
to make them safe places to invest, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   George Ayittey, a Ghanaian and assistant professor of economics at American
University, agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They have held so many of these summits that this one just looks like
another talk shop,'' he said. ``If you ask most Africans, they will tell you the
first priority ought to be to stop all these stupid civil wars,'' many of which
Ayittey blames on ``incumbent despots'' who won't give up power.
</P>
<P>
	   In Sub-Saharan Africa alone, countries wracked by conflict include Ethiopia,
Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan, Rwanda, Burundi, Congo, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
	   Others are ``standing in line to blow up,'' Ayittey said. ``Until you clean
that up, nobody is going to sink a million dollars into Africa.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	   How the National Summit on Africa works, and its activities this week:
</P>
<P>
	   Since its inception in 1996, organizers assembled what they say was an
unprecedented grass-roots program. Scholars, business people, charities,
development organizations and ``people from all walks of life'' including
African immigrants met in several regional summits across the country and come
up with a draft plan to bring about what they say would be improved U.S.
policies toward Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   The draft contains 236 recommendations, which will be debated and finally
approved next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   It suggests action to be taken in trade, investment, development, education,
peace, security, human rights, the environment and development of democracy.
</P>
<P>
	   Ideas range from the monumental -- the United States should arrange an
international Marshall Plan of reconstruction and reparations in Africa -- to
the small -- the State Department should make sure embassy employees in Africa
know local languages as a sign of respect to host nations.

<HEADLINE> DiCaprio's 'The Beach' Opens  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Leonardo DiCaprio became king of the heartthrobs when he
followed the ship down in "Titanic" -- adoring female fans helped make the film
an all-time box-office juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
	   Now that DiCaprio has hit dry land in "The Beach," the question is whether
fans will flock to theaters to see their idol playing a dark, rather ignoble
character.
</P>
<P>
	   Opening yesterday, "The Beach" stars DiCaprio as Richard, an American
backpacker in Thailand who embarks on a quest for paradise after obtaining a map
to an idyllic island.
</P>
<P>
	   While it's another journeyman's role for DiCaprio, his character is a
weak-willed cousin to the intrepid, artistic vagabond Jack Dawson of "Titanic,"
which took in $1.8 billion at theaters worldwide.
</P>
<P>
	   There's more weasel than hero about Richard. Instead of dancing jigs in
steerage and freezing in the North Atlantic to save his true love, Richard
sleeps around, lies unabashedly and goes savage and sneering in the wilderness.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard is a juvenile braggart, a feeble philosopher and a bit of a coward
to boot. He also swills snake's blood, unable to back away from a dare.
</P>
<P>
	   Not a pretty picture for your typical teen idol.
</P>
<P>
	   But it's a picture DiCaprio may have needed to paint to keep his career
moving forward, said Nancy Krulik, author of a biography and a trivia book about
the actor.
</P>
<P>
	   "To continuously play the handsome artist from Paris, that only goes so
far," she said. "It's wise to move away from that because it will increase his
longevity."
</P>
<P>
	   Being a heartthrob "is a very short-lived career," Krulik said. "You don't
want to end up as the next 'E! True Hollywood Story' of David Cassidy."
</P>
<P>
	   DiCaprio, 25, has borne the heartthrob mantle for only two of the dozen or
so films he's done: "Titanic" in 1997, and "William Shakespeare's Romeo +
Juliet" the year before.

<P>
	   He's taken on much chancier roles for other movies. In "The Basketball
Diaries," DiCaprio played a teen-age junkie who fantasizes about going on a gun
rampage in his school. He was Meryl Streep's surly son in "Marvin's Room," and
Robert De Niro's abused stepson in "This Boy's Life." He earned an Oscar
nomination as Johnny Depp's retarded brother in "What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"
</P>
<P>
	   "There's nothing cynical in his choices," said Tom Rothman, president of the
film group for 20th Century Fox, which released "The Beach" and co-produced
"Titanic" with Paramount. "He chose to do 'The Beach' when he basically could
have done any movie Hollywood had to offer."
</P>
<P>
	   But Fox figures the movie plays as well to men as an adventure tale as to
women for the DiCaprio romantic element, Rothman said. But the film will lose
some of DiCaprio's faithful teen audience -- it's R rating for violence means
anyone under 17 is supposed to be accompanied by a parent or guardian.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Bucksbaum, a film analyst for Reel Source Inc., said DiCaprio's
darker persona in "The Beach" may win him new fans among adults who were "kind
of disgusted with how much attention he got from 'Titanic."'
</P>
<P>
	   "The worst thing that could happen for this movie is that with new ID
procedures at theaters, most of his teen-age following around 13 and even
younger will not get a chance to see it," Bucksbaum said. "You may get a lot of
girls paying for another movie then slipping in to see 'The Beach."'

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Expand Family Leave  </HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton proposed Saturday spending $20 million
to help states find ways to offer paid leave to working parents in need.
Americans should not be forced to choose between their families and their jobs,
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also said in his weekly radio address he wants the family and
medical leave law he signed in 1993 expanded to include 10 million employees of
small companies not covered now.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans reacted cooly to both ideas.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the past seven years, the law has allowed more than 20 million
Americans to take as many as a dozen weeks of unpaid leave to care for a newborn
child or deal with a medical crisis at home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today there are still large numbers of families who need to take leave
from work, but can't afford to give up the income,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
	   If approved by Congress, the $20 million would fund competitive grants to
help develop the states develop new approaches to making paid leave more
available. States could identify workers facing the greatest financial barriers
and use unemployment insurance or temporary disability insurance to offer them
paid leave.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional Republicans cast doubt on Clinton's plan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president told us he would never demand that taxpayers pay for people
to leave work,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., chairman of the House Republican
Conference. ``Now he wants the states to do it out of working Americans pockets.
This is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
	   Watts also raised concerns about how the family leave law is being used.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now employers don't know if someone is permitted to leave for something
serious like breast cancer or something frivolous like an ingrown toenail,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Clinton said the issue has touched the lives of so many Americans,
including his own.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've often wondered how my own mother, when she was a young widow, would
have been able to go away to train as a nurse if my grandparents hadn't been
there to take care of me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My mother and I were lucky. So were many other American families. But none
of our families should have to rely on luck alone,'' he said. ``And no American
should ever have to choose between the job they need and the parent or child
they love.''
</P>
<P>
	   The administration says that in 85 percent of cases, family leave costs
employers nothing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In fact, in many cases it has actually helped save them money by cutting
down on turnover and reducing the expense of training new workers,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Endorsing the president's proposal, the AFL-CIO president said two-thirds of
eligible workers who decline to take family or medical leave did so because they
cannot afford to skip a paycheck.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fact that the United States stands alone among industrialized nations
in failing to provide job-protected, paid parental leave is a national
disgrace,'' John Sweeney said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   He said organized labor will fight to extend paid family leave to all
working families.
</P>
<P>
	   Judith Lichtman, president of the National Partnership for Women and
Families, welcomed the opportunity for states to expand the leave program.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At a time when we have such a strong economy, and working families need
relief so urgently, this initiative is a major step forward that can make a real
difference to millions of Americans,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Trimble Seeks IRA Weapons Promise  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The senior Protestant in Northern
Ireland's impotent administration said Saturday that the Irish Republican Army
must promise to disarm if the government is to have its powers restored.
</P>
<P>
	   Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble emerged unscathed from a party
conference in downtown Belfast, where his many critics had originally planned to
demand his ouster and the party's withdrawal from the 10-week-old
administration.
</P>
<P>
	   But Britain had already stripped the Cabinet's authority Friday and resumed
direct control from London -- effectively saving Trimble's political skin.
</P>
<P>
	   The Belfast coalition of two British Protestant and two Irish Catholic
parties, including the IRA-linked Sinn Fein, was the central goal of Northern
Ireland's Good Friday peace accord of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   At a news conference in Catholic west Belfast, a downcast Gerry Adams, the
leader of Sinn Fein, said Britain's determination to safeguard Trimble's shaky
hold over his party confirmed that the Ulster Unionists could wield ``a veto
over progress.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Cabinet was formed in November under a compromise plan mediated by
American diplomat George Mitchell. But it fell apart this month over the IRA's
continued refusal to start scrapping its secret weapons dumps, as the accord
envisioned.
</P>
<P>
	   Trimble said his principal objective now was ``to see the administration
re-formed -- but re-formed on a sound basis, so that people are in fact
implementing all the principles of the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
	   To the Ulster Unionists, whose status as the largest party means its
participation is essential for the Cabinet to work, ``a sound basis'' means
gaining an unprecedented disarmament commitment from the IRA.
</P>
<P>
	   The outlawed group called a cease-fire in 1997 after killing about 1,800
people during a 27-year campaign to abolish Northern Ireland as a
Protestant-majority state linked with Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   The Good Friday accord empowered an independent disarmament commission led
by Canadian Gen. John de Chastelain to seek the IRA's total disarmament by May.
</P>
<P>
	   Hours after Britain revoked the Cabinet's powers, de Chastelain reported
that, in their most recent talks, an IRA representative said the group would
``consider how to put arms and explosives beyond use,'' and would actually do
this if the right context was created by politicians. That, De Chastelain said,
``holds out the real prospect of an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Trimble said he had talked Friday to Sinn Fein's Adams and Martin
McGuinness -- both reputed former IRA commanders -- and neither could tell him
what the IRA had in mind.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Even though claims are being made of important proposals, no detail has
become available to anyone,'' said Trimble, who intends to meet the Sinn Fein
leaders again this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Using the umbrella term for the IRA and Sinn Fein, he added: ``We need the
republican movement to tell us: Are they committing themselves to (weapons)
decommissioning? How are they going to do it? When are they going to do it? And
of course we'd be delighted to see them do it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Adams insisted the IRA's latest plans, which he declined to detail,
contained sufficient merit for Britain to have withheld plans to suspend the
Cabinet. He said Britain appeared ``fixated'' on helping Trimble.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we had delivered the IRA lock, stock and barrel -- in a way the British
government had never been able to do in 30 years of militarism -- it would not
have been enough yesterday,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Trimble said his party should never again be expected to share power
with Sinn Fein on the basis of ``ambiguous language,'' as he conceded happened
in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Trimble said no democratic society would ``willingly include in their
government a party that was organically linked to a terrorist organization. We,
however, decided to stretch that point.''
</P>
<P>
	   Should another deal emerge, he said, it would be ``obviously unreasonable to
expect us to proceed in any other way than on the basis of absolute clarity.''

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Albanians Flee From Serb Area  </HEADLINE>
   By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Despite new security measures, ethnic
Albanians fled from the Serb part of this city Saturday, complaining that angry
Serbs had forced them to leave and that the United Nations was powerless to stop
it.
</P>
<P>
	   An ethnic Albanian human rights group demanded French peacekeepers leave
Kosovska Mitrovica because they had lost control to ``Serb criminals.'' Kosovo's
most multiethnic city has been wracked by violence since a grenade attack last
week on a U.N. bus killed two elderly Serbs.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, Serbs have been forcing ethnic Albanians to leave their homes in
the northern part of the city despite appeals by U.N. chief administrator
Bernard Kouchner and others. On Friday, Kouchner announced new security
measures, including more police and U.N. troops to protect the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
	   Kouchner's announcement, however, did little to calm the deteriorating
situation. Ethnic Albanians, carrying a few belongings in plastic bags, lumbered
Saturday across the bridge over the Ibar River to the safety of the southern,
Albanian-dominated side.
</P>
<P>
	   Sylejman Deliv said about 20 bearded Serb men came to his apartment building
at 5 a.m., banged on the apartments of ethnic Albanian residents and ordered
them to leave immediately or ``we will kill you.''
</P>
<P>
	   Deliv said the terrified residents telephoned the U.N. civilian police.
``But they didn't do anything,'' so the residents left.
</P>
<P>
	   Sylejman Plana, 55, and his wife, Advie, 52, said they were expelled earlier
in the week but tried to return to their apartment to pick up personal
belongings. After peacekeepers refused to escort them home, the couple returned
to the north side on their own.
</P>
<P>
	   Sylejman Plana said they were intercepted by Serbs ``who beat me'' and
turned them back.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not enough to have just one policeman,'' he said as he stood,
bewildered, on the bridge trying to decide what to do next. ``They will attack
us. They will kill us.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear how many of the estimated 4,500 ethnic Albanians living in
the Serb area had been expelled during the past week. The U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees said Friday that about 650 ethnic Albanians had registered with the
United Nations for humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
	   Many others probably did not bother to register and simply moved in with
friends or relatives in the ethnic Albanian part of the city, U.N. officials
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Halit Berani, head of the local ethnic Albanian ``Committee for the Defense
of Human Rights,'' said that, over the past two days, a total of 71 expulsion
cases had been reported to his group.
</P>
<P>
	   He urged NATO to remove the French troops from the city.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The French army and U.N. police left the positions they were at, they
withdrew and they didn't do anything,'' he said. ``The Serb criminals then had
their hands free to do whatever they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
	   A French spokesman, Lt. Col. Patrick Chanliau, described the situation in
the city Saturday as ``calm but tense.'' He said someone threw a grenade and
opened fire late Friday at a Serb house in the north of the city, but there were
no injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the increased security, Kouchner said the United Nations would
enforce a decree issued last year authorizing police and troops to expel from
the city or even the province any ``troublemakers'' who foment discord.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said a ``security zone'' would be established where public protests
would be banned.
</P>
<P>
	   About 140 British reinforcements have moved into the city, joining 150
German, Dutch and Italian reinforcements that already had arrived. Several U.N.
policemen have complained that the French were slow to respond when the violence
exploded last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere, NATO said an American peacekeeper, whose name was not released,
was in stable condition Saturday after suffering a gunshot wound to the leg late
Friday. An Army spokeswoman, Maj Debbie Allen, said investigators were looking
into whether the wound was accidentally self-inflicted.
</P>
<P>
	   Three ethnic Albanians were arrested after shooting in the direction of
Norwegian soldiers near Obilic, NATO said. No one was hurt. Also Friday, a
vehicle carrying Russian soldiers struck a dynamite device buried along a road
near Glogovac in central Kosovo, NATO said. There were no injuries, but the
vehicle was heavily damaged.

<HEADLINE> Jeb Bush Says GOPers Trust Families  </HEADLINE>
   By BRIGITTE GREENBERG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush's brother used the GOP's weekly radio
address Saturday to make the case that, unlike ``the Clinton-Gore
administration,'' Republicans ``trust American families ... more than we trust
government.''
</P>
<P>
	   Florida Gov. Jeb Bush criticized President Clinton for threatening to veto a
Republican-sponsored bill that would cut income taxes for married couples by
eliminating the so-called ``marriage penalty'' for dual-income families.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the House passed the marriage bill, 268-158, short of the
two-thirds margin needed to override a presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill would cut income taxes by $182 billion over 10 years for all
married taxpayers, including the 25 million couples who pay the ``marriage
penalty'' compared with single people filing separately. Clinton complained
about the legislation's cost and timing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unfortunately, the Clinton-Gore administration doesn't believe that
America's married couples can be trusted to keep more of what they earn,'' Bush
said. ``As Republicans, we trust America's families. We trust them more than we
trust government.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Florida governor made no mention of his father, former President Bush,
or his brother, Texas Gov. George W. Bush -- the Bush who hopes to challenge
Democrats Vice President Al Gore or former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
	   But Jeb Bush did point to Republican governors in Arizona, Colorado,
Connecticut and other GOP-led states for cutting taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he pushed the largest tax cut in Florida's history last year -- more
than $1 billion in tax relief for older people, small business and working
families.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush likewise did not mention White House scandals that Republicans
routinely assert has cost the Clinton administration its trustworthiness.
Instead, Bush stuck to his theme that Republicans trust America's families and
used the example of GOP advocacy of school choice initiatives such as charter
schools.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know I speak for my colleagues in the Republican Governors' Association
when I say that we will exercise the courage to fight for education reforms,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If public officials have trust and faith in the people we serve, and allow
them the freedom to pursue their dreams, our nation will be strong and
prosperous.''

<HEADLINE> Advocates for Africa Urge Change  </HEADLINE>
   By PAULINE JELINEK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Advocates for Africa are meeting this week to emphasize
the positive about the continent and change Americans' views of -- and their
government's policies on -- its impoverished and war-torn nations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The philosophy is ... that the glass is half full, not half empty,'' said
Leonard Robinson, president of the National Summit on Africa. A former assistant
U.S. secretary of state, Robinson is among those arguing for greater trade, aid,
cultural exchanges and other programs for Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   It's hard for many to see it that way.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Americans and Europeans will get together, talk and feel good -- and not a
... thing will happen for Africa,'' says Walter Williams, head of the economics
department at George Mason University in Virginia. ``This stuff is for domestic
consumption.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the summit, Robinson will preside over a five-day meeting of an estimated
5,000 people starting Wednesday. Selected delegates will vote, essentially, on
what the United States should be doing on the 54-nation continent.
</P>
<P>
	   The effort, funded by the Carnegie Foundation, Ford Foundation, businesses
and others, has been in the making since late 1996 and has three main goals:
</P>
<P>
	   Summit organizers want:
</P>
<P>
	   --Unify and strengthen what organizers say has been a weak and sometimes
at-odds-with-itself lobby for Africa in America. They point to an American
Jewish lobby they say has been effective in shaping U.S.-Israeli policy.
</P>
<P>
	   --Improve Africa's image in the states, where they say the media have
focused too much on the negative.
</P>
<P>
	   --Get the U.S. government to change its policy toward Africa, a continent
they say has been either ignored or mishandled over the decades.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to ensure that policy-makers accept the reality that Africa
matters,'' said Robinson. ``We want to create an atmosphere where Africa will be
respected and treated with equity, not automatically relegated to the back
burner of U.S. foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
	   The goals echo some of the ideas of President Clinton, scheduled to speak to
the summit Thursday. Others invited include current or former presidents of
South Africa, France and Kenya as well as officials from the United Nations and
the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has promoted, with only limited success, a greater partnership with
Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   House and Senate leaders hope to pass an African trade bill by next month,
the first major trade bill in five years. The legislation primarily would cut
tariffs on imported African clothing and promote U.S. sales and investment on
the continent.
</P>
<P>
	   Summit organizers are trying to get leading U.S. presidential candidates to
speak about their prospective policies toward Africa. They and some black
American leaders say the Clinton administration has paid more attention to
Africa than any other White House in years. They want to ensure that after he
leaves office, that policy not only will continue but be expanded.
</P>
<P>
	   To that end, they have produced a plan of action for U.S. African policy
that will be completed Sunday and will be sent to Congress, administration
officials and leaders of American civil, social and religious organizations as
well as city mayors, Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics doubt it will do much good.
</P>
<P>
	   Where summit organizers see an Africa with three of the four fastest-growing
economies in the world, a continent making progress toward democracy, critics of
the summit see an Africa that remains ``a basket case,'' said George Mason
economist Williams.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that except for a handful of nations making some headway with their
economies, ``I wouldn't invest a dime in any country in Africa.'' Most African
nations still lack the rule of law, respect for contracts and other essentials
to make them safe places to invest, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   George Ayittey, a Ghanaian and assistant professor of economics at American
University, agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They have held so many of these summits that this one just looks like
another talk shop,'' he said. ``If you ask most Africans, they will tell you the
first priority ought to be to stop all these stupid civil wars,'' many of which
Ayittey blames on ``incumbent despots'' who won't give up power.
</P>
<P>
	   In Sub-Saharan Africa alone, countries wracked by conflict include Ethiopia,
Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan, Rwanda, Burundi, Congo, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
	   Others are ``standing in line to blow up,'' Ayittey said. ``Until you clean
that up, nobody is going to sink a million dollars into Africa.''

<HEADLINE> Details on Africa Summit  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   How the National Summit on Africa works, and its activities this week:
</P>
<P>
	   Since its inception in 1996, organizers assembled what they say was an
unprecedented grass-roots program. Scholars, business people, charities,
development organizations and ``people from all walks of life'' including
African immigrants met in several regional summits across the country and come
up with a draft plan to bring about what they say would be improved U.S.
policies toward Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   The draft contains 236 recommendations, which will be debated and finally
approved next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   It suggests action to be taken in trade, investment, development, education,
peace, security, human rights, the environment and development of democracy.
</P>
<P>
	   Ideas range from the monumental -- the United States should arrange an
international Marshall Plan of reconstruction and reparations in Africa -- to
the small -- the State Department should make sure embassy employees in Africa
know local languages as a sign of respect to host nations.

<HEADLINE> Duck Statues Stolen From Moscow Park  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Strollers in a Moscow park found the statues of a mother
mallard and her babies to be charming, but to thieves they were just sitting
ducks.
</P>
<P>
	   The bronze statues of the mother and two of the seven ducklings trailing
single-file behind her have been sawed off at the legs and spirited away from
Novodevichy Park. The theft occurred on Feb. 6, the Moscow Times newspaper cited
police spokesman Vladimir Zubkov as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   The statues are replicas of statues in the Boston Public Garden and portray
the characters from ``Make Way for Ducklings,'' a children's book popular for
generations in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The book tells of the travails of a mallard family looking for a new home in
the midst of a noisy city. The Moscow park, adjacent to the Novodevichy convent
and cemetery that are among the capital's top tourist destinations, is an area
of calm amid the central city's clamor.
</P>
<P>
	   The Moscow statues were presented in 1991 by Barbara Bush, the wife of
then-President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Zubkov, the police spokesman, said he was ``heartbroken'' and officers are
investigating the theft, the newspaper reported Friday.

<HEADLINE> Prince Rainier Has Lung Operation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) -- Prince Rainier of Monaco has undergone a second
lung operation after doctors found air building up in his chest cavity.
</P>
<P>
	   The condition, known as pneumothorax, can cause partial or complete collapse
of the lung if left untreated.
</P>
<P>
	   The prince's medical team issued a statement saying the operation, which
started shortly after midnight Friday, had been carried out ``in good
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second lung operation for the 76-year-old prince in as many
weeks. Rainier was already in the hospital recovering from an operation Feb. 2
when doctors removed part of his lung in order to examine a small nodular
growth.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors said the growth was discovered during routine testing in December
and that it is no cause for alarm. They have not said whether it was cancerous.
</P>
<P>
	   Rainer, who has ruled the tiny Riveria principality for 50 years, also had
an operation in December to repair an aneurysm in his abdominal aorta.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Wiranto Said Resigning  </HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK McDOWELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Asserting his authority after a two-week political
standoff, Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid said Saturday that his security
minister must either resign or be fired for his role in the rampage last year in
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
	   The dispute between Wahid and Gen. Wiranto has dogged the president during
his two-week tour abroad, which ends Sunday. The trip began with Indonesian and
U.N. human rights panels releasing reports holding Wiranto responsible for the
violence in his former role as armed forces commander.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid said repeatedly that he expected Wiranto to resign, but Wiranto
refused, fueling speculation that the standoff could lead to a coup.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid played down those fears Saturday during his visit to Bangkok for a
U.N. trade conference, but subtle shifts in his position throughout the day
reflected the apparent tightrope he was walking.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech to a Thai-Indonesian business luncheon early Saturday, Wahid
said that the reason Wiranto had not yet resigned was because the two men had
not met face-to-face since the East Timor reports were issued.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid said he would meet Wiranto after returning home early Sunday and the
resignation would be announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly afterward, Wahid's aides softened the Monday deadline. Wahid told a
subsequent news conference only that an announcement about resignation would be
made Monday, but stopped short of saying whether Wiranto would actually quit.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked to clarify his comments, Wahid said Wiranto was out one way or
another.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's up to him whether to resign or not,'' Wahid said Saturday night. ``If
he does not resign, I will change the Cabinet anyway, without him. I respect him
very much and will give him a respectful place, but not in the Cabinet.''
</P>
<P>
	   The dispute has tested Indonesia's jerky transition from decades of
authoritarian rule toward democracy since Wahid became president in October and
attempted to reduce the military's long-standing sway over politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid, also known as Gus Dur, said he understood Wiranto's concerns that
resigning could leave him open to prosecution for war crimes, but said it would
be better for Indonesia if he steps down now.
</P>
<P>
	   It would show that the nation of 200 million people, undergoing severe
economic and political turmoil over the past three years, is serious about
democratic reforms and restoring stability.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His resignation will be seen by other countries as a sign we are serious,
that you can invest in Indonesia,'' Wahid said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Jakarta, Wiranto's aides refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Wiranto allowed his troops to arm and train anti-independence
militias in East Timor as the territory headed for a U.N.-organized referendum
on independence. When East Timorese voted overwhelmingly to end a
quarter-century of Indonesian rule, the militias went on a rampage of burning
and killing.
</P>
<P>
	   Jose Ramos-Horta, an East Timorese leader and co-winner of the Nobel Peace
Prize in 1996, said Wiranto's removal had become inevitable.
</P>
<P>
	   The former general was ``totally isolated, even within the Indonesian armed
forces,'' Ramos-Horta said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Upon the decision of President Wahid to fire Wiranto, we must all, the
whole international community, back Gus Dur,'' Ramos-Horta said. ``At stake is
the credibility of the democratic regime in Indonesia.''

<HEADLINE> The "human trade" - wealth for smugglers, woes for smuggled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Chen Jian looks scared and uncertain when asked about
his prospects. The 29-year-old illegal immigrant, after three years in the
United States, still owes $40,000 to cover the cost of being smuggled from
China.
<P>
	   In November, he discovered his kidney was rapidly failing and he needed a
transplant. Now he receives dialysis three times a week, which makes it
impossible for him to work and pay off his debt.
</P>
<P>
	   "I owe a lot of money so I waited a long time before I got this checked out.
I was barely able to stand by the time I saw the doctors," Chen said, speaking
in a voice strangely calm given his desperate situation.
</P>
<P>
	   His problems are compounded because his sister - who doctors say may be the
only source for a kidney - cannot get a U.S. visitor's visa. Immigration
officials worry that once here, she would try to stay on illegally.
</P>
<P>
	   While Chen's situation is extreme, Chinatown community activist Steven Wong
says the man from coastal Fujian province in southern China is also typical of
the thousands of Chinese illegal immigrants caught on a treadmill in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   They come to escape poverty and hopelessness in China, then get trapped
between greedy immigrant smugglers and the bureaucratic rules of the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service, said Wong.
</P>
<P>
	   Illegal immigration from China has skyrocketed since the Tiananmen Square
massacre in 1989. Although more than 280,000 Chinese are admitted to the United
States each year, estimates are that an additional 30,000 to 70,000 come
illegally.
</P>
<P>
	   "Many people would say they wouldn't even bother with trying to get a visa-
what was the use," said Li Yong Qian, the former head of a Chinatown community
organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Wong complained that INS and State Department officials refuse to recognize
some immigrants have real problems or genuine grounds for asylum. He said
officials fall back on bureaucratic attitudes and what he called racist
policies, which only add to the smuggling of aliens as families try to reunite.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a belief that all Chinese want to come and stay here illegally,"
he said. "Why does there have to be this double standard?"
</P>
<P>
	   A State Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said
conditions within an applicant's home country may be taken into account in
deciding on a visa but that no country is discriminated against.
</P>
<P>
	   The source said the applicant's economic situation and ties to the community
are fully studied, then a consular officer decides whether there is a risk the
person will try to stay illegally in the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Aside from those who have obvious reasons for immigrating - like Chen's
sister - many Chinese are unhappy with the pace of economic reforms at home and
are drawn by the belief that pay is higher and opportunity greater in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Ko-Lin Chin, author of "Smuggled Chinese: Clandestine
Immigration to the United States," (Temple University Press), the reality is
that immigrants often work 70 or 80 hour weeks in Chinatown restaurants or
garment factories for below minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
	   "People in Chinatown have a saying: 'We kiss the stove during the day and
kiss the pillow at night,"' Wong said, describing the daily routine of many
illegal Chinese immigrants.
</P>
<P>
	   Chen Jian says that after working in a candy factory for seven years he was
enticed to leave China by a smuggler's alluring description of the "American
Dream."
</P>
<P>
	   "The economy was bad and unpredictable where I was living. I was told that I
would be able to make a lot of money in the United States, and I wanted to
improve my situation," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
	   For most, the cost of the trip is high and the journey complex and
frightening. Prices run from $45,000 to $65,000 depending on how vigilant the
INS is at any time and the skills of the smuggler, said Ko-Lin Chin.
</P>
<P>
	   The smugglers - called "snakeheads" because their clients supposedly slither
across borders like snakes - run elaborate international networks of safehouses
and often use bribery to obtain passports and visas.
</P>
<P>
	   Since most Chinese do not have $45,000 or more, they usually borrow money
from relatives in the United States or from village or family organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   Chen Jian said that he gave his snakehead a deposit of $1,000, and borrowed
the rest from relatives. In return he was given a Chinese passport with a Thai
visa and was flown to Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
	   In Thailand, Chen waited only for two days in a safehouse for his smuggler
to get him a U.S. tourist visa, although many wait for weeks or months. He said
he then flew to San Francisco and simply "walked on through" - meaning he had no
problems with INS when he entered U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
	   Chinese immigrants have long been smuggled to the West Coast in reeking ship
holds, by plane, or by road from Mexico and Canada. In the past two years,
smugglers have even taken to packing people in cargo containers for the trip
across the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
	   Illegal immigrants are difficult to catch, too. INS spokesman Don Mueller
says the agency tries to nab people at sea so they have fewer legal options.
Once the immigrants reach U.S. soil, he said, they have "a whole avenue of
options."
</P>
<P>
	   Many apply for political asylum, which can take "a significant amount of
time," Mueller said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Those that have a good case are likely to show up for their hearings and
those that don't aren't likely to show up and often disappear into the
underground economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The vast majority of those coming from China are economic migrants and INS
tries to return them, Mueller said. But last year, only 1,000 illegal Chinese
immigrants were sent home and 2,500 others applied for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
	   Mueller stressed that the United States' situation is not unique. "The
United Nations estimates that 500,000 to a million people leave China every year
to go to other countries so it is a worldwide problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ultimately, most illegal Chinese immigrants to America are sent to New York
because the city is home to the smuggling networks and to relatives of many
immigrants. The arrivals are often held in smugglers' safehouses until relatives
pay the full smuggling price, Ko-Lin Chin said. If the payment does not come
quickly, migrants are often beaten.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've seen guys come out of these places with hammer marks on their chest
or missing fingers. It's pretty ugly," Wong said.
</P>
<P>
	   For smugglers, the human trade pays very well and involves minimal danger.
</P>
<P>
	   "At $60,000 a head and with as many people as are being moved, we are
talking a billion dollar business. This is more lucrative than smuggling drugs,"
Wong said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mueller said the smugglers usually do not face much prison time if caught.
In extreme cases, some get up to five years per alien smuggled but that "it's
usually far less severe than that," he said. Ko-Lin Chin says some snakeheads
get as little as 15 months in jail.
</P>
<P>
	   Wong believes that the spread of immigrant smuggling can only be solved if
both the U.S. and Chinese governments stop pointing fingers at each other and
sit down to discuss a new approach to stemming the human tide.
</P>
<P>
	   "A better policy would be to wrongly admit 100 into this country," he said,
"rather than refuse to admit one person who is experiencing true hardship."

<HEADLINE> New Fragrance Museum offers visitors an aromatic experience  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The Metropolitan Museum of Art is so big it's hard to
decide what to see, and at the Guggenheim you just go round and round. But now a
new museum is adding some scents to the art scene in New York.
<P>
	   	   The Museum of Fragrance is housed in a small loft on East 32nd Street,
far from Fifth Avenue's tony "museum mile." While it has no Old Masters, its
history of fragrance in America offers pleasures for both the nose and eye.
</P>
<P>
	   Along with a display of 250 fragrance flacons, there's a 25-foot timeline
showing which fragrances were introduced from 1949 through the 1990s and how
they were tied to social trends.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1950s, the decade that brought us TV dinners and Elvis, women wooed
men with scents called "Hope," "Ambush" and "Intimate." Twenty years later, with
the women's movement in full swing, marketing experts reflected that with
fragrances like "Charlie," "Blazer" and "Woman."
</P>
<P>
	   There's also a "Smelling Scenter," where visitors can sniff popular
ingredients from each decade, and a "Seeing Scents" corner to view fragrance
commercials through the years.
</P>
<P>
	   The 45-minute video narrated by television pioneer Imogene Coca may not
appeal to those who heard enough of the "Charlie" jingle in the 1970s, but it is
a great mirror into the social goings-on in the past.
</P>
<P>
	   A 1950s Avon commercial tells us that even drab housewives in bathrobes can
become princesses with a dab of perfume (theirs, of course). In the '60s,
mini-skirted women found the man wearing "High Karate" irresistible. But by the
1970s, the "Enjoli" woman could do it all herself - "bring home the bacon, and
fry it up in a pan."
</P>
<P>
	   Annette Green, president of the industry group, The Fragrance Foundation,
worked for years to develop the museum, which opened in November. She said it's
the first of its kind in America; similar fragrance museums exist in Paris and
Oita Island in Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   "Smell is the most misunderstood and ignored of all our senses," said Green.
And with the explosion in the U.S. fragrance industry - its annual retail sales
have grow from $250,000 in 1950 to $6 billion today - it's a profitable one as
well. Those figures do not even include the booming home fragrance, bath and
body, and aromatherapy markets.
</P>
<P>
	   The current exhibit, "50 Years of Fragrance in America," commemorates the
foundation's 50th anniversary and runs through April 28.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1949, when the foundation was organized to convince American women that
perfume, toilette water and cologne could add romance to their otherwise dull
lives, fragrance meant two things: French and expensive.
</P>
<P>
	   "Those lucky enough to have it would only use it for special occasions, and
then they would put on their string of pearls and put exactly two dabs behind
each ear," Green said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1950s, European manufacturers introduced 30 new women's fragrances
and six for men. It wasn't until the 1960s that Revlon introduced the first
American-born fragrance, Norell.
</P>
<P>
	   If the '50s belonged to America's housewives, the '60s were owned by the
hippies, Green said. "It was the first time a fragrance came from the streets,"
she said, after a group of back-to-nature Californians bottled and sold musk oil
as a scent.
</P>
<P>
	   By the early 1970s, Jovan capitalized on the musk trend and its musk oil
perfume became the hottest selling fragrance in America. The '70s was also the
decade of "Annie Hall," menswear for women and "Charlie," a fragrance that
appealed to young, independent women.
</P>
<P>
	   Beginning in the '60s, men also became fragrance wearers. In the 1950s, 90
percent of all fragrances sold were for women. Today the gap is closing: 60
percent of scents sold are women's fragrances and 40 percent men's.
</P>
<P>
	   The '80s brought perfumes by American designers like Ralph Lauren and Calvin
Klein and, said Green, for "the first time women began to think of fragrance as
a must-have fashion accessory."
</P>
<P>
	   Like everything else in the driven 1980s, fragrances introduced in that
decade - with names like "Poison" and "Obsession' - were big and over-the-top.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a voluptuous, egocentric decade and fragrances were too," Green
said. "People wanted you to be able to smell them from across the room."
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1990s, Green said, fragrance fans were choosing different scents to
match their moods - whether they wanted to be energized or relaxed.
</P>
<P>
	   Green predicts the next trend will be fragrances to help stressed out
workers and harried homebodies relax.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're already working on virtual reality cable boxes that will release
smells of the ocean or rainforest into our living rooms at the touch of a
button," Green said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said alarm clocks may release spritzes of citrus or peppermint in the
air to awaken and energize, adding it all part of the new importance of
fragrance.
</P>
<P>
	   "For the first time in history," she said, "smell is being recognized as an
influential sense."

<HEADLINE> Giuliani calls for release of national oil reserve  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, accusing President Clinton of
ignoring the pain of New Yorkers, called Saturday for the release of the
country's oil reserve to offset this winter's staggering increase in home
heating oil costs.
<P>
	   Clinton was "clearly turning his back on the suffering of all New Yorkers
around the state," the mayor said at City Hall. "What I've learned is that the
only way to reach the White House is to make it a political issue."
</P>
<P>
	   White House deputy press secretary Jim Kennedy responded that selling the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve to lower oil prices was not allowed by law.
</P>
<P>
	   "The president has taken strong measures to help struggling families pay
their energy bills," Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer contradicted Kennedy, saying sale of the reserve
was legal in an emergency. The Clinton administration has not labeled the
current situation as meeting that standard.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani released a three-paragraph letter that he sent to the White House,
urging the sale of a portion of the reserve to create competition that would
drive prices down.
</P>
<P>
	   Many other politicians in the Northeast, including Schumer, have also called
on the president to provide relief for the oil prices.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, which pays the nation's highest home heating oil costs, the
price per gallon has shot up from 72 cents to $2.50 since the first of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Schumer said he welcomed Giuliani's efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   "My attitude is, 'The more, the merrier,"' said Schumer, who first called
for sale of the reserve in September. "We can use all the support we can get."
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani estimated the drastic increase would end up costing the city as
much as $14 million, while the average New Yorker would pay an extra $350 this
winter to heat their home.
</P>
<P>
	   "New Yorkers are feeling real pain," Giuliani said. "Unfortunately,
President Clinton is not feeling the pain of New Yorkers."
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani's shots at Clinton came as first lady Hillary Clinton, his opponent
in November's U.S. Senate election, made campaign stops in four of the city's
five boroughs.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor urged the sale of 2 percent of the reserve to lower oil prices.
The prices began soaring after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
rolled back production by 4.3 million barrels a day last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal government earlier this week announced $130 million in
assistance to help the indigent cover their heating costs. But Energy Secretary
William Richardson said there were no plans to sell the reserve.

<HEADLINE> Adjusted for inflation, Whitman's spending patterns hit two-decade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman's second term budgets, when
adjusted for inflation, so far show a growth rate in spending the likes of which
New Jersey has not seen in 15 years.
<P>
	   The growth trends are concealed within dry, year-by-year budget summaries
and boasts of controlled spending.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've built a record of fiscal responsibility, a record of which we can be
proud," Whitman said in her Jan. 24 budget address. "We've held the annual rate
of growth of the state budget to its lowest level in 30 years."
</P>
<P>
	   But an Associated Press budget analysis that tracked spending over 20 years,
matching it against the Bureau of Labor Statistics' numbers on inflation, showed
a growth in government spending that rivaled the spending of former Gov. Thomas
Kean, a fellow Republican, in the revenue-rich 1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman's budgets since her 1997 re-election have set several landmarks:
</P>
<P>
	   - State spending to provide services to New Jersey's 8 million residents
will bypass the magical $20 billion mark in July, and perhaps before then,
exceeding $2,600 for every man, woman and child.
</P>
<P>
	   - State spending last year increased enough to more than double what would
have been the normal growth caused by inflation over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1980, the budget was $4.89 billion. With inflation, that would equal
$9.89 billion in 1999. State spending in fiscal 1999, the last year audited, was
double that amount at $18.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   - The annual growth of state spending has hit 7.3 percent in the three years
of Whitman's second term, which is about 170 percent above the rate of
inflation. By comparison, Kean in his final term raised spending to about 100
percent above inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   In Kean's second term, January 1986 to January 1990, budgets increased an
average of 8.8 percent, but inflation in those four years was much higher than
now, averaging 4.5 percent. Inflation in Whitman's last three years has averaged
2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, it is quite possible the Legislature will add its own spending to
the $21.3 billion budget Whitman unveiled last month: Lawmakers have tacked on
additional spending in each of the past six years.
</P>
<P>
	   Judging from the last two years, legislative add-ons likely this spring and
additional spending by the Whitman administration next year probably will push
actual spending for the 2000-2001 fiscal year to $22 billion or beyond.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if the budget holds at its initial total of $21.3 billion, Whitman has
exceeded the spending increases under former Gov. Jim Florio, who is a frequent
target of Whitman's fiscal criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   "Less than 10 years ago, the state budget was balanced through higher taxes
on things like toilet paper and practices such as the state selling itself a
highway it already owned," the governor said in her Jan. 24 speech.
"Fortunately, those are now distant memories."
</P>
<P>
	   In his four years, Florio increased budgets an average of 5.5 percent during
a period when inflation averaged 2.6 percent. By contrast, Whitman over her six
budgets has increased spending an average of 5.3 percent in a period with
roughly the same inflation rate.

<HEADLINE> Russians Battle Chechen Rebels  </HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW KRAMER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SLEPTSOVSKAYA, Russia (AP) -- Russian warplanes and ground troops on
Saturday battered Chechnya's southern mountains where thousands of rebels were
entrenched, and the Russian military claimed to be strengthening its hold on
strategic heights.
</P>
<P>
	   Since Russian forces claimed control of the breakaway republic's capital,
Grozny, after a rebel exodus early in February, the military has increasingly
focused on the mountains, where up to 8,000 rebels are believed to be based
among the rugged, snowy slopes.
</P>
<P>
	   But federal forces are continuing to face some resistance from rebel
holdouts in Grozny, the army headquarters for the North Caucasus told the
Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the army, Russian forces have seized nearly all the commanding
heights of the Argun and Vedeno gorges, which extend deep into the mountains and
are believed to be important supply routes for the fighters.
</P>
<P>
	   Chechen rebels attacked a Russian guard post overnight on the border with
Georgia, the only foreign country bordering Chechnya, the news agency ITAR-Tass
reported, citing border guard officials. There were no casualties among the
guards, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels, although far outnumbered by Russian troops, are skilled in
mounting hit-and-run attacks, especially in the mountains where they can quickly
fade into the crags and fog.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Russia claims to control most of Chechnya after nearly five months
of fighting, rebels this week ambushed two military trains and attacked federal
units, demonstrating that they can still inflict bloody damage on Russian
forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian warplanes, despite inclement weather, flew more than 70 combat
missions over the past 24 hours, attacking rebel bases and camps in the two
gorges, the military command said, according to Interfax.
</P>
<P>
	   The attacks wiped out 11 reinforced rebel positions, a communications center
and an air-defense position, among other targets, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   While Russian troops tried to put down the rebels remaining in Grozny, work
was beginning to establish civilian ``self-rule'' administrations in the city's
districts, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
	   However, prospects were in doubt for a large-scale return of civilians to
the city that once had a population of 400,000. Months of heavy bombing and
shelling, followed by intense street-fighting, have left the city in ruins. Many
refugees say they do not plan to return, and some Russian officials say there is
no money to restore the city.
</P>
<P>
	   At the border with Ingushetia, two checkpoints that had been closed by
Russian troops were reopened Saturday, and refugees were being allowed to move
freely into and out of Ingushetia, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Passage is unrestricted for men and women alike,'' Ingush Interior
Minister Khamzat Gutseriyev told Interfax.
</P>
<P>
	   The military said it had closed the checkpoints before to halt attempts by
rebels to infiltrate Ingushetia in the guise of civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov announced Friday that his forces were
launching a guerrilla war throughout Chechnya, including areas that Russian
forces have occupied for months, Russia's NTV television reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Col. Gen. Valery Manilov, a high-ranking military official, dismissed
Maskhadov's announcement as a ``bluff.''
</P>
<P>
	   Russia sent troops into Chechnya in September after Chechen-based Islamic
militants twice invaded the neighboring region of Dagestan. Authorities also
claim Chechen rebels are tied to apartment bombings that killed about 300 people
in Russia in September.
</P>
<P>
	   Manilov said Friday that 1,175 Russian servicemen had been killed and 3,544
injured since the start of the operation in Chechnya. But many observers have
said the toll appears to be far higher.

<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Far fewer mentally ill people have been ordered to
take their medication by courts under the state's "Kendra's Law" than some
advocates for the program predicted when the law took effect Nov. 8.
<P>
	   Only 20 people are under court order to take medication and only one of
those has been committed to a mental facility for failing to do so. County
mental health officials are reviewing 288 other cases to see if they should also
be brought before judges or some other treatment arrangement can be worked out,
state Mental Health Commissioner Dr. James Stone told a legislative budget
hearing last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Those numbers are a far cry from the estimates by some officials of how many
people would be subject to Kendra's Law when it was created by Gov. George
Pataki and the state Legislature last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Those estimates varied from several hundred to one New York City official's
projection of 7,000 people falling under the program in the city alone.
</P>
<P>
	   But Roger Klingman, a spokesman for the state Office of Mental Health, said
that the Kendra's Law is being administered properly.
</P>
<P>
	   "Given the fact the program has been implemented for only three months,
those are significant numbers," Klingman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kendra's Law is named after Kendra Webdale, a woman who was pushed to her
death under the wheels of a New York City subway train in January 1999 by a man
with a long history of psychiatric troubles and treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   The program is chiefly administered by county mental health officials. They
get referrals from doctors, hospitals, family members and others of people who
are suffering from severe mental illnesses and not taking their medication. If
people could pose a danger to themselves or to others, they are subject to the
Kendra's Law provisions.
</P>
<P>
	   County mental health workers try to work out a treatment and medicine-taking
regimen with those people.
</P>
<P>
	   Stone told legislators that 91 people have been evaluated and voluntarily
accepted treatment rather than face court orders.
</P>
<P>
	   Harvey Rosenthal, executive director of the New York Association of
Psychiatric Rehabilitation Services, said his group questions how "voluntary"
those 91 cases really were.
</P>
<P>
	   "Is there a subtle form of coercion because people have to accept what is
offered because they'll have to go to court if they don't?" Rosenthal asked. "I
have heard rumors that people have been told, 'Either agree to this now or we'll
see you in court.' But we have no hard data."
</P>
<P>
	   If a case ends up before a court under Kendra's Law, a mental hygiene legal
services representative must be present to represent the interests of the
mentally ill person. Rosenthal suggested that such a legal representative should
also be present when the mentally ill are brought in by county mental health
officials to discuss treatment and medication options.
</P>
<P>
	   Rosenthal's group opposed the involuntary commitment aspects of Kendra's
Law. He said, however, that the law has forced county mental health officials to
become more closely involved in the cases of the seriously ill in their
counties.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Gov. George Pataki has proposed spending $125 million more in
the 2000-2001 state budget on the mentally ill. That will include significant
new resources on the screening and treatment of the seriously mentally ill,
Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor also declared a moratorium for 2000 on the downsizing of state
mental institutions to give officials more time to evaluate how many beds are
needed to treat the seriously mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
	   Stone told legislators last week it is too early to tell if the moratorium
should continue past this year.

<HEADLINE> Festive Crowd Protests Austria Govt.  </HEADLINE>
   By MELISSA EDDY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Vienna's streets took on a carnival atmosphere
Saturday as Austrians continued their peaceful protests against the new
government inaugurated last week.
</P>
<P>
	   The appointment of the government, which includes the right-wing Freedom
Party of Joerg Haider, has generated a wave of protest in Austria and abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day 2,000 Austrians held a peaceful demonstration in the
western city of Innsbruck; 3,000 demonstrated in Linz, about 75 miles west of
Vienna; and 400 protested in Feldkirch, on the Austrian-Swiss border, the
Austrian Press Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Around 2,000 people representing different political and interest groups
gathered at Vienna's main railway station in the early afternoon for a march
down one of the city's busiest shopping streets.
</P>
<P>
	   By the time the march had reached the parliament building, the crowd had
swelled to about 5,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to organizers' requests for peaceful demonstrations, protesters
carried banners, European Union flags and made noise with pots and pans,
whistles, drums and shakers.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowd -- organized by communist, socialist and union groups -- included
parents carrying children and foreigners living in Austria.
</P>
<P>
	   By evening, the protesters arrived at the Karl Marx Hof, a public housing
complex built in the 1920s that was the scene of heavy fighting during the
Austrian civil war between communists and fascists in the early 1930s.
</P>
<P>
	   As the crowd moved past the apartment buildings, many residents opened their
windows and waved. In one window, a man shook a tambourine in rhythm with the
drum beat accompanying the marchers. Two fire-eaters perched on the pedestal of
a statue in front of the buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the marchers, a 28-year-old musician who would give only his first
name, Helmut, said he approved of the diplomatic measures taken by the European
Union and Israel against the new government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think its actually not so bad,'' he said. ``Only when reactions came
from abroad did people here wake up to what is happening. It was necessary.''
</P>
<P>
	   The musician said he had launched his own e-mail campaign urging wind
instrument musicians to join him. He was accompanied by about 15 musicians
playing their instruments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The European Union should not tolerate someone like Haider playing any
role in government,'' said another protester, Rudiger Landgraf.
</P>
<P>
	   Landgrif said the protests might not be having a huge political effect,
``but symbolically its a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
	   A truck with a calypso band brought up the rear of the march.
</P>
<P>
	   Demonstrations have been peaceful since violence broke out on the night the
new government was inaugurated.

<HEADLINE> Hillary tours NYC as an official candidate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton schmoozed and smiled her way
through New York City on Saturday, planning five campaign stops in four boroughs
in an effort to rally support from minorities and elderly voters, whose help
she'll need in her run for U.S. Senate.
<P>
	   Clinton returned to the city after a whirlwind week upstate following the
official announcement of her bid last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   She met with black Democrats and senior citizens in Queens, and planned
campaign stops at the Caridad Restaurant, a Hispanic eatery in Washington
Heights; a Democratic rally in the Bronx; and a dinner in Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
	   The well-chosen crowds loved her.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will be behind you, and we will be able to march you on to victory in
November," U.S. Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., told a beaming Clinton before about
150 black Democrats at York College in Jamaica, Queens.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowd cheered and chanted "Hillary, Hillary, Hillary!" as Clinton vowed
to push for new jobs and affordable health care, teacher training and a tax
deduction for college tuition.
</P>
<P>
	   "She has nearly total support in the black community," said Jeff Diggs, a
Queens resident at the rally.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no choice in the black community except her," Diggs said. "Not
only is Mr. (Rudolph) Giuliani so unpopular, but the issues that she espouses
are clearly those that appeal to the black community."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton will need heavy turnout from neighborhoods like Jamaica - a working
class black enclave with a powerful Democratic organization - if she is to
defeat Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   Without mentioning the mayor by name, Clinton alluded to the criticism that
has flown between the two campaigns this week over issues like campaign
fundraising and posting the ten commandments in public school classrooms.
</P>
<P>
	   "I intend to run a campaign on issues and ideas, not on insults," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   At a Queens senior citizens residence, Clinton proposed a $3,000 tax credit
for families caring for sick or disabled relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   "Many of you know how difficult it is and exhausting to care for a loved one
who is physically or psychologically having difficulty," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   A tax credit, she argued, "will help support the diverse needs that people
have in long-term care." Clinton also said that government should provide more
services and information to such families.
</P>
<P>
	   The seniors cheered her pledges of support for Medicare, Social Security and
cheaper prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am so elated that you are here," one woman gushed. "You have my vote."

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Albanians Flee Serb Area  </HEADLINE>
   By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Despite new security measures, ethnic
Albanians fled from the Serb part of this city Saturday, complaining that angry
Serbs had forced them to leave and that the United Nations was powerless to stop
it.
</P>
<P>
	   An ethnic Albanian human rights group demanded French peacekeepers leave
Kosovska Mitrovica because they had lost control to ``Serb criminals.'' Kosovo's
most multiethnic city has been wracked by violence since a grenade attack last
week on a U.N. bus killed two elderly Serbs.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, Serbs have been forcing ethnic Albanians to leave their homes in
the northern part of the city despite appeals by U.N. chief administrator
Bernard Kouchner and others. On Friday, Kouchner announced new security
measures, including more police and U.N. troops to protect the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
	   Kouchner's announcement, however, did little to calm the deteriorating
situation. Ethnic Albanians, carrying a few belongings in plastic bags, lumbered
Saturday across the bridge over the Ibar River to the safety of the southern,
Albanian-dominated side.
</P>
<P>
	   Sylejman Deliv said about 20 bearded Serb men came to his apartment building
at 5 a.m., banged on the apartments of ethnic Albanian residents and ordered
them to leave immediately or ``we will kill you.''
</P>
<P>
	   Deliv said the terrified residents telephoned the U.N. civilian police.
``But they didn't do anything,'' so the residents left.
</P>
<P>
	   Sylejman Plana, 55, and his wife, Advie, 52, said they were expelled earlier
in the week but tried to return to their apartment to pick up personal
belongings. After peacekeepers refused to escort them home, the couple returned
to the north side on their own.
</P>
<P>
	   Sylejman Plana said they were intercepted by Serbs ``who beat me'' and
turned them back.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not enough to have just one policeman,'' he said as he stood,
bewildered, on the bridge trying to decide what to do next. ``They will attack
us. They will kill us.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear how many of the estimated 4,500 ethnic Albanians living in
the Serb area had been expelled during the past week. The U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees said Friday that about 650 ethnic Albanians had registered with the
United Nations for humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
	   Many others probably did not bother to register and simply moved in with
friends or relatives in the ethnic Albanian part of the city, U.N. officials
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Halit Berani, head of the local ethnic Albanian ``Committee for the Defense
of Human Rights,'' said that, over the past two days, a total of 71 expulsion
cases had been reported to his group.
</P>
<P>
	   He urged NATO to remove the French troops from the city.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The French army and U.N. police left the positions they were at, they
withdrew and they didn't do anything,'' he said. ``The Serb criminals then had
their hands free to do whatever they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
	   A French spokesman, Lt. Col. Patrick Chanliau, described the situation in
the city Saturday as ``calm but tense.'' He said someone threw a grenade and
opened fire late Friday at a Serb house in the north of the city, but there were
no injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the increased security, Kouchner said the United Nations would
enforce a decree issued last year authorizing police and troops to expel from
the city or even the province any ``troublemakers'' who foment discord.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said a ``security zone'' would be established where public protests
would be banned.
</P>
<P>
	   About 140 British reinforcements have moved into the city, joining 150
German, Dutch and Italian reinforcements that already had arrived. Several U.N.
policemen have complained that the French were slow to respond when the violence
exploded last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere, NATO said an American peacekeeper, whose name was not released,
was in stable condition Saturday after suffering a gunshot wound to the leg late
Friday. An Army spokeswoman, Maj Debbie Allen, said investigators were looking
into whether the wound was accidentally self-inflicted.
</P>
<P>
	   Three ethnic Albanians were arrested after shooting in the direction of
Norwegian soldiers near Obilic, NATO said. No one was hurt. Also Friday, a
vehicle carrying Russian soldiers struck a dynamite device buried along a road
near Glogovac in central Kosovo, NATO said. There were no injuries, but the
vehicle was heavily damaged.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani calls for release of national oil reserve  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, accusing President Clinton of
ignoring the pain of New Yorkers, called Saturday for the release of the
country's oil reserve to offset this winter's staggering increase in home
heating oil costs.
<P>
	   Clinton was "clearly turning his back on the suffering of all New Yorkers
around the state," the mayor said at City Hall. "What I've learned is that the
only way to reach the White House is to make it a political issue."
</P>
<P>
	   White House deputy press secretary Jim Kennedy responded that selling the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve to lower oil prices was not allowed by law.
</P>
<P>
	   "The president has taken strong measures to help struggling families pay
their energy bills," Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer contradicted Kennedy, saying sale of the reserve
was legal in an emergency. The Clinton administration has not labeled the
current situation as meeting that standard.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani released a three-paragraph letter that he sent to the White House,
urging the sale of a portion of the reserve to create competition that would
drive prices down.
</P>
<P>
	   Many other politicians in the Northeast, including Schumer, have also called
on the president to provide relief for the oil prices.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, which pays the nation's highest home heating oil costs, the
price per gallon has shot up from 72 cents to $2.50 since the first of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Schumer said he welcomed Giuliani's efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   "My attitude is, 'The more, the merrier,"' said Schumer, who first called
for sale of the reserve in September. "We can use all the support we can get."
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani estimated the drastic increase would end up costing the city as
much as $14 million, while the average New Yorker would pay an extra $350 this
winter to heat their home.
</P>
<P>
	   "New Yorkers are feeling real pain," Giuliani said. "Unfortunately,
President Clinton is not feeling the pain of New Yorkers."
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani's shots at Clinton came as first lady Hillary Clinton, his opponent
in November's U.S. Senate election, made campaign stops in four of the city's
five boroughs.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor urged the sale of 2 percent of the reserve to lower oil prices.
The prices began soaring after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
rolled back production by 4.3 million barrels a day last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal government earlier this week announced $130 million in
assistance to help the indigent cover their heating costs. But Energy Secretary
William Richardson said there were no plans to sell the reserve.

<HEADLINE> Pity the Florists on Valentine's Day  </HEADLINE>
   By DON BABWIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Pity the florists.
</P>
<P>
	   We come up with really bad Valentine's Day poems and they have to write
them. Then they have to sign them ``Pookie Woo,'' ``Your Big Italian Stud'' or
the ``Penguin.'' And when Seinfeld and his girlfriend called each other
``Schmoopie,'' florists had to listen to it on Valentine's Day -- and write it.
Over and over again.
</P>
<P>
	   The same thing happened with the movie ``Jerry McGuire.'' ``We've had some
'You complete me,''' said Charlotte Eisemann at An Uptown Bloom in Dallas,
referring to a Tom Cruise line in the film.
</P>
<P>
	   But lack of originality isn't the only problem.
</P>
<P>
	   Try spending the day, as Eisemann does, writing out customers' poems like
this one: ``Life can be lonely and treat you like crud, That's why I'm so happy
you're my bud.''
</P>
<P>
	   The poetry is no better in Miami, where Gio Vidal at Feel The Flowers
recounted this last verse to a poem: ``Yes, you are the one who hogs my time,
and I also want to wish you a Happy Valentine.''
</P>
<P>
	   And sometimes even the most circumspect florist just has to ask.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One man wanted a card made out to 'My Little Onion Booty Girl,''' said
Anamillie Garcia at Michael's Flower Shop in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I had to ask him what that means,'' said Garcia. ``He said 'Every time I
look at her it makes me cry.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Linda Michel, at Chicago Balloons and Flowers, remembered a touching note to
someone named Mark. ``Mark, the only object of my true affection,'' she said.
The note ended with a P.S. ``If you show this to anyone I will beat you up.''
</P>
<P>
	   You want heartbreaking stories? Sharon Heath, the owner of Cahokia Floral
and Gift in Cahokia, Ill., said she sees people sending flowers anonymously,
figuring if they don't get a thank you they have proof they aren't the only
admirers in their Valentine's lives.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I had one driver say, 'I need to go tell the guy (his girlfriend) has
flowers from a whole bunch of people,''' Heath said. ``I told him he couldn't do
that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Florists also say that while some people seem embarrassed by what they want
written on the cards, many clearly aren't -- even those who dictate in graphic
detail some of their most erotic fantasies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Usually if they call on the phone they know I don't know them, so they
don't care what I hear,'' said Stephanie Gregg at Langdon Florist in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   You think there's no pressure in the flower business? ``We had one guy who
bought three sets of roses, one for his wife, one for his secretary and one for
his girlfriend,'' said Camille Vaden, of Blooms on Broadway in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I could have really messed up his life if I mixed the cards up.''

   WHEAT RIDGE, Colo. (AP) -- Items collected by the tail gunner on the plane
that dropped a nuclear bomb on Hiroshima will auctioned off.
</P>
<P>
	   The photos, books, clothing and other mementos are part of the estate of
George Robert Caron. He was on the Enola Gay, the B-29 that dropped the bomb on
Aug. 6, 1945.
</P>
<P>
	   Caron, who was given a camera at the last moment, snapped a roll of

were printed on millions of leaflets that were dropped over Japan the next day.
</P>
<P>

Sunday. Among the objects is a photograph signed by five of the bomber's 12-man
crew.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want it to be in the hands of people who will appreciate the history,''
said his daughter, Jane Wunder.
</P>
<P>
	   After the war, Caron worked as a design engineer for Sundstrand Corp. He
died in 1995 of complications from pneumonia at age 75.

<HEADLINE> The "human trade" - wealth for smugglers, woes for smuggled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Chen Jian looks scared and uncertain when asked about
his prospects. The 29-year-old illegal immigrant, after three years in the
United States, still owes $40,000 to cover the cost of being smuggled from
China.
<P>
	   In November, he discovered his kidney was rapidly failing and he needed a
transplant. Now he receives dialysis three times a week, which makes it
impossible for him to work and pay off his debt.
</P>
<P>
	   "I owe a lot of money so I waited a long time before I got this checked out.
I was barely able to stand by the time I saw the doctors," Chen said, speaking
in a voice strangely calm given his desperate situation.
</P>
<P>
	   His problems are compounded because his sister - who doctors say may be the
only source for a kidney - cannot get a U.S. visitor's visa. Immigration
officials worry that once here, she would try to stay on illegally.
</P>
<P>
	   While Chen's situation is extreme, Chinatown community activist Steven Wong
says the man from coastal Fujian province in southern China is also typical of
the thousands of Chinese illegal immigrants caught on a treadmill in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   They come to escape poverty and hopelessness in China, then get trapped
between greedy immigrant smugglers and the bureaucratic rules of the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service, said Wong.
</P>
<P>
	   Illegal immigration from China has skyrocketed since the Tiananmen Square
massacre in 1989. Although more than 280,000 Chinese are admitted to the United
States each year, estimates are that an additional 30,000 to 70,000 come
illegally.
</P>
<P>
	   "Many people would say they wouldn't even bother with trying to get a visa-
what was the use," said Li Yong Qian, the former head of a Chinatown community
organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Wong complained that INS and State Department officials refuse to recognize
some immigrants have real problems or genuine grounds for asylum. He said
officials fall back on bureaucratic attitudes and what he called racist
policies, which only add to the smuggling of aliens as families try to reunite.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a belief that all Chinese want to come and stay here illegally,"
he said. "Why does there have to be this double standard?"
</P>
<P>
	   A State Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said
conditions within an applicant's home country may be taken into account in
deciding on a visa but that no country is discriminated against.
</P>
<P>
	   The source said the applicant's economic situation and ties to the community
are fully studied, then a consular officer decides whether there is a risk the
person will try to stay illegally in the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Aside from those who have obvious reasons for immigrating - like Chen's
sister - many Chinese are unhappy with the pace of economic reforms at home and
are drawn by the belief that pay is higher and opportunity greater in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Ko-Lin Chin, author of "Smuggled Chinese: Clandestine
Immigration to the United States," (Temple University Press), the reality is
that immigrants often work 70 or 80 hour weeks in Chinatown restaurants or
garment factories for below minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
	   "People in Chinatown have a saying: 'We kiss the stove during the day and
kiss the pillow at night,"' Wong said, describing the daily routine of many
illegal Chinese immigrants.
</P>
<P>
	   Chen Jian says that after working in a candy factory for seven years he was
enticed to leave China by a smuggler's alluring description of the "American
Dream."
</P>
<P>
	   "The economy was bad and unpredictable where I was living. I was told that I
would be able to make a lot of money in the United States, and I wanted to
improve my situation," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
	   For most, the cost of the trip is high and the journey complex and
frightening. Prices run from $45,000 to $65,000 depending on how vigilant the
INS is at any time and the skills of the smuggler, said Ko-Lin Chin.
</P>
<P>
	   The smugglers - called "snakeheads" because their clients supposedly slither
across borders like snakes - run elaborate international networks of safehouses
and often use bribery to obtain passports and visas.
</P>
<P>
	   Since most Chinese do not have $45,000 or more, they usually borrow money
from relatives in the United States or from village or family organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   Chen Jian said that he gave his snakehead a deposit of $1,000, and borrowed
the rest from relatives. In return he was given a Chinese passport with a Thai
visa and was flown to Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
	   In Thailand, Chen waited only for two days in a safehouse for his smuggler
to get him a U.S. tourist visa, although many wait for weeks or months. He said
he then flew to San Francisco and simply "walked on through" - meaning he had no
problems with INS when he entered U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
	   Chinese immigrants have long been smuggled to the West Coast in reeking ship
holds, by plane, or by road from Mexico and Canada. In the past two years,
smugglers have even taken to packing people in cargo containers for the trip
across the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
	   Illegal immigrants are difficult to catch, too. INS spokesman Don Mueller
says the agency tries to nab people at sea so they have fewer legal options.
Once the immigrants reach U.S. soil, he said, they have "a whole avenue of
options."
</P>
<P>
	   Many apply for political asylum, which can take "a significant amount of
time," Mueller said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Those that have a good case are likely to show up for their hearings and
those that don't aren't likely to show up and often disappear into the
underground economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The vast majority of those coming from China are economic migrants and INS
tries to return them, Mueller said. But last year, only 1,000 illegal Chinese
immigrants were sent home and 2,500 others applied for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
	   Mueller stressed that the United States' situation is not unique. "The
United Nations estimates that 500,000 to a million people leave China every year
to go to other countries so it is a worldwide problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ultimately, most illegal Chinese immigrants to America are sent to New York
because the city is home to the smuggling networks and to relatives of many
immigrants. The arrivals are often held in smugglers' safehouses until relatives
pay the full smuggling price, Ko-Lin Chin said. If the payment does not come
quickly, migrants are often beaten.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've seen guys come out of these places with hammer marks on their chest
or missing fingers. It's pretty ugly," Wong said.
</P>
<P>
	   For smugglers, the human trade pays very well and involves minimal danger.
</P>
<P>
	   "At $60,000 a head and with as many people as are being moved, we are
talking a billion dollar business. This is more lucrative than smuggling drugs,"
Wong said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mueller said the smugglers usually do not face much prison time if caught.
In extreme cases, some get up to five years per alien smuggled but that "it's
usually far less severe than that," he said. Ko-Lin Chin says some snakeheads
get as little as 15 months in jail.
</P>
<P>
	   Wong believes that the spread of immigrant smuggling can only be solved if
both the U.S. and Chinese governments stop pointing fingers at each other and
sit down to discuss a new approach to stemming the human tide.
</P>
<P>
	   "A better policy would be to wrongly admit 100 into this country," he said,
"rather than refuse to admit one person who is experiencing true hardship."

<HEADLINE> New Fragrance Museum offers visitors an aromatic experience  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The Metropolitan Museum of Art is so big it's hard to
decide what to see, and at the Guggenheim you just go round and round. But now a
new museum is adding some scents to the art scene in New York.
<P>
	   	   The Museum of Fragrance is housed in a small loft on East 32nd Street,
far from Fifth Avenue's tony "museum mile." While it has no Old Masters, its
history of fragrance in America offers pleasures for both the nose and eye.
</P>
<P>
	   Along with a display of 250 fragrance flacons, there's a 25-foot timeline
showing which fragrances were introduced from 1949 through the 1990s and how
they were tied to social trends.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1950s, the decade that brought us TV dinners and Elvis, women wooed
men with scents called "Hope," "Ambush" and "Intimate." Twenty years later, with
the women's movement in full swing, marketing experts reflected that with
fragrances like "Charlie," "Blazer" and "Woman."
</P>
<P>
	   There's also a "Smelling Scenter," where visitors can sniff popular
ingredients from each decade, and a "Seeing Scents" corner to view fragrance
commercials through the years.
</P>
<P>
	   The 45-minute video narrated by television pioneer Imogene Coca may not
appeal to those who heard enough of the "Charlie" jingle in the 1970s, but it is
a great mirror into the social goings-on in the past.
</P>
<P>
	   A 1950s Avon commercial tells us that even drab housewives in bathrobes can
become princesses with a dab of perfume (theirs, of course). In the '60s,
mini-skirted women found the man wearing "High Karate" irresistible. But by the
1970s, the "Enjoli" woman could do it all herself - "bring home the bacon, and
fry it up in a pan."
</P>
<P>
	   Annette Green, president of the industry group, The Fragrance Foundation,
worked for years to develop the museum, which opened in November. She said it's
the first of its kind in America; similar fragrance museums exist in Paris and
Oita Island in Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   "Smell is the most misunderstood and ignored of all our senses," said Green.
And with the explosion in the U.S. fragrance industry - its annual retail sales
have grow from $250,000 in 1950 to $6 billion today - it's a profitable one as
well. Those figures do not even include the booming home fragrance, bath and
body, and aromatherapy markets.
</P>
<P>
	   The current exhibit, "50 Years of Fragrance in America," commemorates the
foundation's 50th anniversary and runs through April 28.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1949, when the foundation was organized to convince American women that
perfume, toilette water and cologne could add romance to their otherwise dull
lives, fragrance meant two things: French and expensive.
</P>
<P>
	   "Those lucky enough to have it would only use it for special occasions, and
then they would put on their string of pearls and put exactly two dabs behind
each ear," Green said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1950s, European manufacturers introduced 30 new women's fragrances
and six for men. It wasn't until the 1960s that Revlon introduced the first
American-born fragrance, Norell.
</P>
<P>
	   If the '50s belonged to America's housewives, the '60s were owned by the
hippies, Green said. "It was the first time a fragrance came from the streets,"
she said, after a group of back-to-nature Californians bottled and sold musk oil
as a scent.
</P>
<P>
	   By the early 1970s, Jovan capitalized on the musk trend and its musk oil
perfume became the hottest selling fragrance in America. The '70s was also the
decade of "Annie Hall," menswear for women and "Charlie," a fragrance that
appealed to young, independent women.
</P>
<P>
	   Beginning in the '60s, men also became fragrance wearers. In the 1950s, 90
percent of all fragrances sold were for women. Today the gap is closing: 60
percent of scents sold are women's fragrances and 40 percent men's.
</P>
<P>
	   The '80s brought perfumes by American designers like Ralph Lauren and Calvin
Klein and, said Green, for "the first time women began to think of fragrance as
a must-have fashion accessory."
</P>
<P>
	   Like everything else in the driven 1980s, fragrances introduced in that
decade - with names like "Poison" and "Obsession' - were big and over-the-top.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a voluptuous, egocentric decade and fragrances were too," Green
said. "People wanted you to be able to smell them from across the room."
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1990s, Green said, fragrance fans were choosing different scents to
match their moods - whether they wanted to be energized or relaxed.
</P>
<P>
	   Green predicts the next trend will be fragrances to help stressed out
workers and harried homebodies relax.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're already working on virtual reality cable boxes that will release
smells of the ocean or rainforest into our living rooms at the touch of a
button," Green said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said alarm clocks may release spritzes of citrus or peppermint in the
air to awaken and energize, adding it all part of the new importance of
fragrance.
</P>
<P>
	   "For the first time in history," she said, "smell is being recognized as an
influential sense."

<HEADLINE> Final 'Peanuts' Comic Says Goodbye  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. (AP) -- Good Grief! It's the final goodbye for Charlie
Brown and his pals.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles Schulz ended his 49-year-old ``Peanuts'' comic strip with a poignant
letter published in Sunday newspapers across the country. The signed letter also
ran when he ended his daily comic strip on Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
	   The 77-year-old cartoonist -- beloved for his timeless characters Charlie
Brown, Snoopy, Linus and Lucy -- is retiring to turn his full attention to
fighting cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   In several Sunday newspapers, the strip opens with Charlie Brown on the
phone saying, ``No, I think he's writing.'' In the next panel, Snoopy is shown
on his dog house, pecking on a typewriter. ``Dear Friends...,'' it reads.
</P>
<P>
	   The final panel, decorated with images from the strip, is Schulz's farewell.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Dear Friends, I have been fortunate to draw Charlie Brown and his friends
for almost 50 years. It has been the fulfillment of my childhood ambition.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unfortunately, I am no longer able to maintain the schedule demanded by a
daily comic strip. My family does not wish Peanuts to be continued by anyone
else, therefore I am announcing my retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have been grateful over the years for the loyalty of our editors and the
wonderful support and love expressed to me by fans of the comic strip.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, Lucy ... how can I ever forget them ...''
</P>
<P>
	   The letter ends with Schulz's signature.
</P>
<P>
	   Classic ``Peanuts'' images decorate the letter: Lucy pulling away a football
as Charlie Brown tries to kick it, Snoopy trying to steal Linus' blanket, and
Lucy getting hit on the head by a baseball with a loud ``Bonk!''
</P>
<P>
	   Schulz's contract stipulates that no one else will ever draw the strip,
which debuted Oct. 2, 1950, and reached an estimated 355 million readers daily
in 75 countries.
</P>
<P>
	   United Feature Syndicate will continue to publish ``Peanuts'' reprints.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani calls for release of national oil reserve  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, accusing President Clinton of
ignoring the pain of New Yorkers, called Saturday for the release of the
country's oil reserve to offset this winter's staggering increase in home
heating oil costs.
<P>
	   Clinton was "clearly turning his back on the suffering of all New Yorkers
around the state," the mayor said at City Hall. "What I've learned is that the
only way to reach the White House is to make it a political issue."
</P>
<P>
	   White House deputy press secretary Jim Kennedy responded that selling the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve to lower oil prices was not allowed by law.
</P>
<P>
	   "The president has taken strong measures to help struggling families pay
their energy bills," Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer contradicted Kennedy, saying sale of the reserve
was legal in an emergency. The Clinton administration has not labeled the
current situation as meeting that standard.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani released a three-paragraph letter that he sent to the White House,
urging the sale of a portion of the reserve to create competition that would
drive prices down.
</P>
<P>
	   Many other politicians in the Northeast, including Schumer, have also called
on the president to provide relief for the oil prices.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, which pays the nation's highest home heating oil costs, the
price per gallon has shot up from 72 cents to $2.50 since the first of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Schumer said he welcomed Giuliani's efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   "My attitude is, 'The more, the merrier,"' said Schumer, who first called
for sale of the reserve in September. "We can use all the support we can get."
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani estimated the drastic increase would end up costing the city as
much as $14 million, while the average New Yorker would pay an extra $350 this
winter to heat their home.
</P>
<P>
	   "New Yorkers are feeling real pain," Giuliani said. "Unfortunately,
President Clinton is not feeling the pain of New Yorkers."
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani's shots at Clinton came as first lady Hillary Clinton, his opponent
in November's U.S. Senate election, made campaign stops in four of the city's
five boroughs.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor urged the sale of 2 percent of the reserve to lower oil prices.
The prices began soaring after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
rolled back production by 4.3 million barrels a day last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal government earlier this week announced $130 million in
assistance to help the indigent cover their heating costs. But Energy Secretary
William Richardson said there were no plans to sell the reserve.

<HEADLINE> Aussie, Kenya Tribes Fight for Land  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE MWANGI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOODOARAIAK, Kenya (AP) -- At first glance, the two peoples couldn't be more
different.
</P>
<P>
	   The four Australian Aborigines were clad in jeans and T-shirts. Sitting
nearby under an acacia tree were 30 Maasai tribal elders draped in traditional
red shawls called shukas, with beads dangling from their elongated ear lobes.
</P>
<P>
	   Although distinct in appearance and usually separated by language and 7,000
miles, Kenya's Maasai and Australia's Aborigines are bound together by their
special, often troubled, tie to the land.
</P>
<P>
	   As cattle herders, they rely on the land for their livelihood. As indigenous
peoples, they have been victimized by British colonists who stole the land. And
as tiny minorities, they are fighting to keep the land or get it back.
</P>
<P>
	   That common legacy brought representatives of the two peoples together one
week ago near Loodoaraiak, about 55 miles southwest of the Kenyan capital of
Nairobi, where they held daylong discussions sponsored by the London-based
non-governmental organization Pilotlight.
</P>
<P>
	   Under current Kenyan law, the government holds land in trust for the Maasai,
an arrangement ripe for exploitation. A bill now pending in the country's
Parliament would recognize the land rights of the Maasai and other pastoralist
tribes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our land is being taken away from us systematically using a pen and
paper,'' said Joseph Ole Simel, a Loodoaraiak community leader. ``Influential
people come here driving very expensive cars and say, 'This is my land.' And
when we ask them to prove it, they produce title deeds.''
</P>
<P>
	   Aborigines, who are believed to have inhabited Australia for about 50,000
years prior to white settlement, also are engaged in a struggle over land. Now
numbering about 353,000, they make up only a tiny minority in the nation's
mostly white population of 18.7 million people.
</P>
<P>
	   Relations between their leaders and the government have soured because of
Prime Minister John Howard's restrictions on Aboriginal land rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Howard also enraged many indigenous leaders last year by stopping short of
saying the word ``sorry'' after Australia's Parliament passed a motion
expressing regret for the treatment of Aborigines.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is still no proper recognition of Aboriginal rights to land,'' said
June Oscar, director of the Kimberly Land Council in western Australia and one
of the four Aborigines who traveled to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
	   During the daylong discussions on Feb. 6, the Aborigines and Maasai compared
strategies and obstacles.
</P>
<P>
	   Chief among their complaints was the belief, still held by many people, that
until white colonizers arrived in Kenya and Australia, the land belonged to no
one.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We share similar sacred sites which are being threatened by the
encroachment of our land,'' said Joanne Willmot, 46, head of the Uluru-Kata
Tjuta National Park Board of Management in Australia.
</P>
<P>
	   The Maasai, encouraged that the Aborigines shared their dreams, were
defiant.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We shall resist any attempt to take this land from us even if it means we
die here,'' Simel said.

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Meeting Erupts in Chaos  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Ross Perot's Reform Party struck back at dissident
Jesse Ventura's faction Saturday during a showdown here which exploded almost
immediately with raw hostility and scuffling. At one point, local police
threatened to shut down the proceedings, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's an illegal meeting!'' Jack Gargan, the embattled chairman of the
national party, hollered from the podium as the audience chanted that he be
turned ``out, out out!'' from his post. A motion to oust him had not come up by
early afternoon, but even Gargan and his allies expected it to succeed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I will not lay down,'' Gargan vowed.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, a Perot ally who identified herself only as Melanie of San
Diego rushed the front of the room and tried to unplug Gargan's microphone
because he wouldn't call the meeting to order.
</P>
<P>
	   Gargan supporter Sue Harris de Bauche of Virginia slapped and pushed Melanie
to the floor, and two police officers separating the two. One escorted Harris de
Bauche from the room, as it rang with members telling each other to ``shut up''
and begin the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Democracy can be messy, can't it?'' said Donna Donovan, spokeswoman for
the Perot faction.
</P>
<P>
	   That's one way of describing months of infighting so fierce that members of
the party founded by Ross Perot openly speculated about whether it would survive
to participate credibly in this year's presidential race.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the Internet, in court and in the press, the factions have battled over
everything from the location of the party's nominating convention, its
philosophical direction, its procedures and even whether certain national
committee members were qualified to be present on Saturday. For months, a move
has been afoot to oust Gargan, Ventura's hand-picked chairman who took his post
in January.
</P>
<P>
	   Certain that enough votes existed to oust Gargan, Ventura fired a preemptive
strike at the national party Friday by quitting, branding it ``dysfunctional''
and urging the Minnesota state party to disaffiliate.
</P>
<P>
	   The same day, Gargan filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Western
District of Virginia seeking the party's financial records, which he says were
never turned over to him by his predecessors, who are loyal to Perot.
</P>
<P>
	   At the meeting, Gargan's allies were far outnumbered by Perot's, and both
sides arrived in the conference room at the Nashville Airport Marriott poised
for a squabble. Gargan got a few steps inside the ropes marking the meeting zone
when he was surrounded by Perot loyalists who objected to Gargan's two attorneys
accompanying him.
</P>
<P>
	   Finally taking the podium, Gargan was able to find two areas of common
ground when he asked participants to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance, and
remain standing for a moment of silence in memory of those killed in the Alaska
Airlines crash last week.
</P>
<P>
	   That was the last moment of peaceful assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   From the podium, Gargan began making his case that the meeting was illegally
called because members were given fewer than the required 30 days of notice.
</P>
<P>
	   He was immediately shouted down by Perot's allies.
</P>
<P>
	   From microphones scattered throughout the audience, motions were made to
oust Gargan from chairing the meeting. He refused to leave the podium and
continued trying to make his case.
</P>
<P>
	   One of his supporters, Dale Barlow of Oklahoma, grabbed Gargan's microphone
at one point and hollered: ``I am ashamed of this party!''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Shut up, Dale!'' someone yelled.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, about eight Nashville police officers who had responded to an
anonymous 911 call gathered outside the conference room, according to Kathryn
Seibel of Tennessee, who organized much of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They said they would shut it down if we didn't get it under control,''
Seibel said. ``I said this was a temporary blip.''
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, Gargan agreed to step aside after the members voted 95-14 to install
Tom McLaughlin of Pennsylvania as the new chairman of the meeting. Gargan agreed
to sit at the edge of the stage while McLaughlin and party secretary Jim Mangia
reviewed the challenges to delegates representing 11 states.
</P>
<P>
	   Like most of Perot's supporters, Seibel vowed to heal the party. But she
recalled wistfully the previous night, when she had dinner with other members
and discussed public policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You would have been impressed; we were talking about light rail, campaign
finance reform,'' Seibel said.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked how she felt about the developments, she said, ``I'm mortified.''

<HEADLINE> For spot movement Sat. Feb. 12 for Sun. Feb. 13  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Far fewer mentally ill people have been ordered to
take their medication by courts under the state's "Kendra's Law" than some
advocates for the program predicted when the law took effect Nov. 8.
<P>
	   Only 20 people are under court order to take medication and only one of
those has been committed to a mental facility for failing to do so. County
mental health officials are reviewing 288 other cases to see if they should also
be brought before judges or some other treatment arrangement can be worked out,
state Mental Health Commissioner Dr. James Stone told a legislative budget
hearing last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Those numbers are a far cry from the estimates by some officials of how many
people would be subject to Kendra's Law when it was created by Gov. George
Pataki and the state Legislature last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Those estimates varied from several hundred to one New York City official's
projection of 7,000 people falling under the program in the city alone.
</P>
<P>
	   But Roger Klingman, a spokesman for the state Office of Mental Health, said
that the Kendra's Law is being administered properly.
</P>
<P>
	   "Given the fact the program has been implemented for only three months,
those are significant numbers," Klingman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kendra's Law is named after Kendra Webdale, a woman who was pushed to her
death under the wheels of a New York City subway train in January 1999 by a man
with a long history of psychiatric troubles and treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   The program is chiefly administered by county mental health officials. They
get referrals from doctors, hospitals, family members and others of people who
are suffering from severe mental illnesses and not taking their medication. If
people could pose a danger to themselves or to others, they are subject to the
Kendra's Law provisions.
</P>
<P>
	   County mental health workers try to work out a treatment and medicine-taking
regimen with those people.
</P>
<P>
	   Stone told legislators that 91 people have been evaluated and voluntarily
accepted treatment rather than face court orders.
</P>
<P>
	   Harvey Rosenthal, executive director of the New York Association of
Psychiatric Rehabilitation Services, said his group questions how "voluntary"
those 91 cases really were.
</P>
<P>
	   "Is there a subtle form of coercion because people have to accept what is
offered because they'll have to go to court if they don't?" Rosenthal asked. "I
have heard rumors that people have been told, 'Either agree to this now or we'll
see you in court.' But we have no hard data."
</P>
<P>
	   If a case ends up before a court under Kendra's Law, a mental hygiene legal
services representative must be present to represent the interests of the
mentally ill person. Rosenthal suggested that such a legal representative should
also be present when the mentally ill are brought in by county mental health
officials to discuss treatment and medication options.
</P>
<P>
	   Rosenthal's group opposed the involuntary commitment aspects of Kendra's
Law. He said, however, that the law has forced county mental health officials to
become more closely involved in the cases of the seriously ill in their
counties.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Gov. George Pataki has proposed spending $125 million more in
the 2000-2001 state budget on the mentally ill. That will include significant
new resources on the screening and treatment of the seriously mentally ill,
Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor also declared a moratorium for 2000 on the downsizing of state
mental institutions to give officials more time to evaluate how many beds are
needed to treat the seriously mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
	   Stone told legislators last week it is too early to tell if the moratorium
should continue past this year.

<HEADLINE> Hillary tours NYC as an official candidate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton schmoozed and smiled her way
through New York City on Saturday, planning five campaign stops in four boroughs
in an effort to rally support from minorities and elderly voters, whose help
she'll need in her run for U.S. Senate.
<P>
	   Clinton returned to the city after a whirlwind week upstate following the
official announcement of her bid last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   She met with black Democrats and senior citizens in Queens, and planned
campaign stops at the Caridad Restaurant, a Hispanic eatery in Washington
Heights; a Democratic rally in the Bronx; and a dinner in Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
	   The well-chosen crowds loved her.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will be behind you, and we will be able to march you on to victory in
November," U.S. Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., told a beaming Clinton before about
150 black Democrats at York College in Jamaica, Queens.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowd cheered and chanted "Hillary, Hillary, Hillary!" as Clinton vowed
to push for new jobs and affordable health care, teacher training and a tax
deduction for college tuition.
</P>
<P>
	   "She has nearly total support in the black community," said Jeff Diggs, a
Queens resident at the rally.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no choice in the black community except her," Diggs said. "Not
only is Mr. (Rudolph) Giuliani so unpopular, but the issues that she espouses
are clearly those that appeal to the black community."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton will need heavy turnout from neighborhoods like Jamaica - a working
class black enclave with a powerful Democratic organization - if she is to
defeat Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   Without mentioning the mayor by name, Clinton alluded to the criticism that
has flown between the two campaigns this week over issues like campaign
fundraising and posting the ten commandments in public school classrooms.
</P>
<P>
	   "I intend to run a campaign on issues and ideas, not on insults," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   At a Queens senior citizens residence, Clinton proposed a $3,000 tax credit
for families caring for sick or disabled relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   "Many of you know how difficult it is and exhausting to care for a loved one
who is physically or psychologically having difficulty," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   A tax credit, she argued, "will help support the diverse needs that people
have in long-term care." Clinton also said that government should provide more
services and information to such families.
</P>
<P>
	   The seniors cheered her pledges of support for Medicare, Social Security and
cheaper prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am so elated that you are here," one woman gushed. "You have my vote."

<HEADLINE> 17 Killed in India State Vote  </HEADLINE>
   By MANISH KUMAR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PATNA, India (AP) -- Violence marred an election in one of India's largest
and poorest states Saturday, with land mine explosions and gunfire killing 17
people -- mostly police.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-phased election in the northeastern state of Bihar featured a race
for the chief minister's job that included one of India's most colorful leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   In the worst of the five land mine explosions in Bihar, eight policemen were
killed in a rural area Friday night. In four mine attacks Saturday, six police
and two poll workers were killed and six others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
	   One policeman was shot dead in a gun battle after one of the explosions.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said they suspected the Maoist Communist Center, which had called for
an election boycott. The leftist group has been blamed for many attacks on
upper-caste villages.
</P>
<P>
	   In the last state assembly election in 1995, more than 70 people were killed
in clashes among rival political activists or in battles with police.
</P>
<P>
	   More than half the 20 million eligible voters cast their ballots in the
first day of the election for the state government, which the colorful Laloo
Prasad Yadav and his wife, Rabri Devi, have headed for 11 years.
</P>
<P>
	   The second stage of voting is Thursday, the third is Feb. 22, and results
will be released Feb. 25.
</P>
<P>
	   Police put on a show of force and authorized local forces to open fire at
political vandals. But despite the heavy security, unidentified gunmen shot at a
candidate in central Bihar, seriously injuring him, the United News of India
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 36 of the more than 3,000 candidates have criminal records or are
facing serious charges in court, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those candidates still embroiled in criminal cases is Yadav, the
former chief minister who changed the face of Indian politics by fashioning a
powerful voting block of low-caste Hindus and ousting political parties
dominated by higher castes.
</P>
<P>
	   While polls showed a tight race for the state's top political position,
analysts predicted Yadav would likely fall from power because of corruption
cases and public frustration over the lack of development in Bihar.
</P>
<P>
	   Yadav, who was first voted chief minister in 1989, was jailed for five
months in 1997 in connection with a scandal over the government paying bogus
bills for animal fodder. He has been released on bail but could still serve jail
time if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   When Yadav was forced to resign while in prison, his party named his wife to
head the state government, although she could barely read and write. She is the
current chief minister.
</P>
<P>
	   The main opponents of Yadav and his Rashtriya Janata Dal party are the
National Democratic Alliance -- the ruling coalition of the federal government
under Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee -- and the chief federal opposition,
the Congress party.
</P>
<P>
	   Violence also marred polling in the northeastern state of Manipur, the only
other Indian state voting Saturday for a new state legislature. At least six
people were killed and 10 others were injured in two attacks by armed militants,
The Press Trust of India reported.

</P>
<P>
	   Judge Samuel Arias Arzeno, who granted the divorce Friday, said Ross was not

<HEADLINE> Princeton proposes sweeping smoking ban  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Your house. Outside. The cigar shop.
<P>
	   If the Princeton Regional Health Commission has its way, those will be only
three places a smoker will be able to light up.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission, which oversees public health in Princeton Borough and
Princeton Township, on Tuesday will introduce the most far-reaching municipal
smoking ban in New Jersey. A public hearing and vote will follow next month.
</P>
<P>
	   Other New Jersey towns have passed ordinances prohibiting smoking in a more
piecemeal fashion. Glassboro, Highland Park, Lawrence Township, Marlboro,
Secaucus and South Brunswick restrict smoking in a variety of sites, according
to antismoking activists.
</P>
<P>
	   But no town has proposed as sweeping a ban as Princeton's. It covers it all
- almost.
</P>
<P>
	   The only exception written into the proposed ordinance is for retail tobacco
shops, according to regional Health Officer Bill Hinshillwood. Otherwise, butts
out, under the proposed code.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're looking at something comprehensive that ties in everything that some
other towns have done," he said. "It covers all public places, workplaces,
restaurants and bars."
</P>
<P>
	   In the works for about six months, the proposal started as a garden variety
smoking ban in specific locations. But then commission members began to think
globally, according to Hinshillwood.
</P>
<P>
	   "The commission considers any environmental smoke as a health hazard, so
it's not justified from a public health standpoint to make exemptions," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hence, bars, where smoking bans are politically difficult to enact, were
included, he said. Bartenders have as much right to a smoke-free environment as
any other kind of employee, the commission believes.
</P>
<P>
	   Hinshillwood declined to supply a copy of the draft proposal, saying
commission members are still "playing around with it." It will be available for
Tuesday's 7:30 p.m. meeting at Borough Hall, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   While unprecedented in New Jersey, outright bans are the rule in the state
of California and in scores of communities elsewhere in the nation, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The two municipalities surrounding Ivy League Princeton University in leafy
northern Mercer County have long been out front on antismoking efforts. They
were among the earliest communities to prohibit cigarette vending machines,
smoking around schools and smoking in municipal buildings, according to Regina
Carlson, executive director of the New Jersey Group Against Smoking Pollution.
</P>
<P>
	   So it didn't surprise her when the two communities became the first in New
Jersey to propose such an exhaustive ban, given the affluence and education of
residents there.
</P>
<P>
	   "Those kinds of places provide more protection (for nonsmokers) than poor,
struggling towns," Carlson said. "Smoke-free air is a luxury when you can't
afford to eat."
</P>
<P>
	   Although Hinshillwood predicted residents will support the new proposal, one
Princeton restaurant owner said the commission can expect a fight.
</P>
<P>
	   "They have not asked my employees what they thought," said Tom Schmierer,
owner of the Alchemist and Barrister, an upscale fixture in the local restaurant
scene. "It sounds like they've done a lot of nonsmoking research but not any
business research. I don't smoke, but I realize it's part of the business."
</P>
<P>
	   Schmierer, whose three dining rooms are all smoke-free, said his waiters
volunteer to work in the smoky bar. Tips there are plentiful, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A smoking ban would chase loyal customers to bars in neighboring towns where
smoking is still allowed, he complained.
</P>
<P>
	   "They keep comparing us to the state of California, but this is a smaller
area. Smokers can go a couple miles up the road. It's not a level playing
field," Schmierer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although his establishment is exempt from the proposed ban, Jorge
Armenteros, owner of the Little Taste of Cuba cigar shop, said he, too, opposes
the proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   "This might help my business if this is the only place where people are
allowed to smoke, but I'm not happy as an American citizen," he said.

    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton schmoozed and smiled her way
through New York City on Saturday, planning five campaign stops in four boroughs
in an effort to rally support from minorities and elderly voters, whose help
she'll need in her run for U.S. Senate.
<P>
	   Clinton returned to the city after a whirlwind week upstate following the
official announcement of her bid last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   She met with black Democrats and senior citizens in Queens, and planned
campaign stops at the Caridad Restaurant, a Hispanic eatery in Washington
Heights; a Democratic rally in the Bronx; and a dinner in Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
	   The well-chosen crowds loved her.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will be behind you, and we will be able to march you on to victory in
November," U.S. Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., told a beaming Clinton before about
150 black Democrats at York College in Jamaica, Queens.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowd cheered and chanted "Hillary, Hillary, Hillary!" as Clinton vowed
to push for new jobs and affordable health care, teacher training and a tax
deduction for college tuition.
</P>
<P>
	   "She has nearly total support in the black community," said Jeff Diggs, a
Queens resident at the rally.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no choice in the black community except her," Diggs said. "Not
only is Mr. (Rudolph) Giuliani so unpopular, but the issues that she espouses
are clearly those that appeal to the black community."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton will need heavy turnout from neighborhoods like Jamaica - a working
class black enclave with a powerful Democratic organization - if she is to
defeat Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   Without mentioning the mayor by name, Clinton alluded to the criticism that
has flown between the two campaigns this week over issues like campaign
fundraising and posting the ten commandments in public school classrooms.
</P>
<P>
	   "I intend to run a campaign on issues and ideas, not on insults," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   At a Queens senior citizens residence, Clinton proposed a $3,000 tax credit
for families caring for sick or disabled relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   "Many of you know how difficult it is and exhausting to care for a loved one
who is physically or psychologically having difficulty," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   A tax credit, she argued, "will help support the diverse needs that people
have in long-term care." Clinton also said that government should provide more
services and information to such families.
</P>
<P>
	   The seniors cheered her pledges of support for Medicare, Social Security and
cheaper prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am so elated that you are here," one woman gushed. "You have my vote."

<HEADLINE> Teen-ager's Last Wish Unfulfilled  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID KINNEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMP HILL, Pa. (AP) -- A teen-ager with a brain tumor died Saturday without
being able to fulfill a last wish: to donate his vital organs.
</P>
<P>
	   Nicholas Breach, 14 of Camp Hill, went into cardiac arrest and died at home.
His heart couldn't be restarted in the ambulance en route to Hershey Medical
Center, and by the time he arrived, it was too late to harvest his heart, lungs,
kidneys and liver.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the heart cannot be restarted, there is too much damage to organs and
they cannot be recovered for transplant,'' said Kevin Sparkman, director of the
Gift of Life Donor Program in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
	   Nicholas was able to donate his corneas for sight-restoring surgery,
however, Sparkman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The eighth-grader had decided to donate his organs after learning in
November that a brain-stem tumor -- the second diagnosed by doctors -- would
take his life.
</P>
<P>
	   Nicholas' last wish may not have been in vain. His reaction to imminent
death by calling an organ donation agency brought attention from as far as South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Breaches got numerous e-mails from people, people wishing them well,
people waiting for transplants, people who had received transplants,'' Sparkman
said. ``We got inquiries literally from around the world.''
</P>
<P>
	   Family members declined comment Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Nicholas is survived by his parents, Rick and Kim Breach, and his
17-year-old brother, Nathan.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabweans Vote on Constitution  </HEADLINE>
   By ANGUS SHAW Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- President Robert Mugabe's waning popularity was put
to the test in a referendum Saturday, but lines for scarce fuel were longer than
those at polling stations -- underscoring the seriousness of Zimbabwe's economic
woes.
</P>
<P>
	   Voter turnout was generally low nationwide on the first of two days of
voting, election officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite a spate of political violence in the runup to the poll, there were
no reports of injuries or arrests Saturday, said Police Chief Augustine Chihuri.
However, police dealt with a few minor scuffles and were investigating reports
of intimidation to prevent ballots being cast in some areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Zimbabweans were voting on proposed changes to the constitution that would
allow Mugabe to retain most of his powers despite growing opposition to his
rule. The constitutional changes also would allow the government to seize land
owned by white descendants of British settlers without paying compensation.
</P>
<P>
	   Lovemore Madhuku, an official of the National Constitutional Assembly, a
coalition of civic, human rights, church and lawyers' groups opposed to the
revised constitution, accused the government of preventing election monitors
from reaching 3,600 polling stations across the country -- opening the way for
rigging.
</P>
<P>
	   The locations of polling stations were announced Friday and monitors
provided by civic groups to the state Electoral Supervisory Commission only
managed to get to 60 percent of the stations in time, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's as if the government wanted to go through this election alone,
without monitors,'' said Priscilla Misihairabwi, a monitoring coordinator.
</P>
<P>
	   She said poll officers took names of voters, enabling their identity to be
linked to a serial number on each ballot paper.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is intimidatory. People fear their vote will be known to the
authorities and they'll vote accordingly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Monitors reported ruling party supporters tearing down opposition posters
Saturday and favored politicians and pro-government tribal chiefs being given
free access to polling stations in violation of voting rules.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Elections Directorate had ``arrogantly'' refused to meet monitors
or NCA officials to discuss their concerns Saturday, Madhuku said.
</P>
<P>
	   An economic crisis has spurred the biggest opposition challenge to Mugabe's
ruling party since he led the former British colony of Rhodesia to independence
in 1980 as Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
	   Inflation and unemployment have soared and diesel, gasoline and power
shortages since December have crippled transport, industry and agriculture. In
Harare, lines for kerosene and gasoline contrasted sharply with the small
clusters of voters passing through polling stations.
</P>
<P>
	   Results are expected Monday.

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Meeting Erupts in Chaos  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Ross Perot's Reform Party struck back at dissident
Jesse Ventura's faction Saturday during a showdown here that exploded almost
immediately with raw hostility and scuffling. At one point, local police
threatened to shut down the proceedings, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's an illegal meeting!'' Jack Gargan, the embattled chairman of the
national party, hollered from the podium as the audience chanted that he be
turned ``out, out out!'' from his post. A motion to oust him had not come up by
mid-afternoon, but even Gargan and his allies expected it to succeed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I will not lay down,'' Gargan vowed.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, a Perot ally who identified herself only as Melanie of San
Diego rushed the front of the room and tried to unplug Gargan's microphone
because he wouldn't call the meeting to order.
</P>
<P>
	   Gargan supporter Sue Harris de Bauche of Virginia slapped and pushed Melanie
to the floor, and two police officers separated the two. One escorted Harris de
Bauche from the room, as it rang with members telling each other to ``shut up''
and begin the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Democracy can be messy, can't it?'' said Donna Donovan, spokeswoman for
the Perot faction.
</P>
<P>
	   That's one way of describing months of infighting so fierce that members of
the party founded by Ross Perot openly speculated about whether it would survive
to participate credibly in this year's presidential race.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the Internet, in court and in the press, the factions have battled over
everything from the location of the party's nominating convention, its
philosophical direction, its procedures and even whether certain national
committee members were qualified to be present on Saturday. For months, a move
has been afoot to oust Gargan, Ventura's hand-picked chairman who took his post
in January.
</P>
<P>
	   Certain that enough votes existed to oust Gargan, Ventura fired a preemptive
strike at the national party Friday by quitting, branding the organization
``dysfunctional'' and urging the Minnesota state party to break away.
</P>
<P>
	   The same day, Ron Young, the treasurer of the Reform Party and a supporter
of Gargan, filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Western District of
Virginia seeking the party's financial records, which he says were never turned
over to him by his predecessors, who are loyal to Perot.
</P>
<P>
	   At the meeting, Gargan's allies were far outnumbered by Perot's, and both
sides arrived in the conference room at the Nashville Airport Marriott poised
for a squabble. Gargan got a few steps inside the ropes marking the meeting zone
when he was surrounded by Perot loyalists who objected to Gargan's two attorneys
accompanying him.
</P>
<P>
	   Finally taking the podium, Gargan was able to find two areas of common
ground when he asked participants to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance, and
remain standing for a moment of silence in memory of those killed in the Alaska
Airlines crash last week.
</P>
<P>
	   That was the last moment of peaceful assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   From the podium, Gargan began making his case that the meeting was illegally
called because members were given fewer than the required 30 days of notice.
</P>
<P>
	   He was immediately shouted down by Perot's allies.
</P>
<P>
	   From microphones scattered throughout the audience, motions were made to
oust Gargan from chairing the meeting. He refused to leave the podium and
continued trying to make his case.
</P>
<P>
	   One of his supporters, Dale Barlow of Oklahoma, grabbed Gargan's microphone
at one point and hollered: ``I am ashamed of this party!''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Shut up, Dale!'' someone yelled.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, about eight Nashville police officers who had responded to an
anonymous 911 call gathered outside the conference room, according to Kathryn
Seibel of Tennessee, who organized much of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They said they would shut it down if we didn't get it under control,''
Seibel said. ``I said this was a temporary blip.''
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, Gargan agreed to step aside after the members voted 95-14 to install
Tom McLaughlin of Pennsylvania as the new chairman of the meeting. Gargan agreed
to sit at the edge of the stage while McLaughlin and party secretary Jim Mangia
reviewed the challenges to delegates representing 11 states.
</P>
<P>
	   Like most of Perot's supporters, Seibel vowed to heal the party. But she
recalled wistfully the previous night, when she had dinner with other members
and discussed public policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You would have been impressed; we were talking about light rail, campaign
finance reform,'' Seibel said.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked how she felt about the developments, she said, ``I'm mortified.''

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Guerrillas Attack Israel  </HEADLINE>
   By ZEINA KARAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Hezbollah guerrillas mounted a fresh attack against
Israeli troops in southern Lebanon on Saturday, a day after they killed a
seventh Israeli soldier and seriously wounded another.
</P>
<P>
	   A Hezbollah official promised more ``humiliating'' attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Security officials said the guerrillas fired several U.S.-made TOW missiles
at the Israeli outpost in Bayyada overlooking the southern port city of Tyre,
which is about a mile from the Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no reports of casualties from the afternoon attack, the officials
said on condition of anonymity. The United States accused the Hezbollah
guerrilla group of using civilian areas to attack Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli army said its troops returned fire. ``The army views with
severity the firing from villages in the security zone,'' a statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli officials said Hezbollah has become more efficient recently through
its use of TOW missiles, which are being supplied by Hezbollah's backer, Iran.
The guerrillas have killed seven Israeli soldiers in less than three weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   The attack Saturday occurred amid an upsurge in violence on the last active
Arab-Israeli warfront. Israeli warplanes recently have knocked out three power
stations in Lebanon and made daily strikes against guerrilla targets in southern
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   International monitors met Friday to defuse tensions, but Israeli
representatives walked out of the meeting after guerrillas killed an Israeli
soldier and wounded another in a rocket attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said he would retaliate for the casualties
in his own time with ``very harsh strikes in Lebanon,'' but he reaffirmed a
pledge to withdraw his troops by July.
</P>
<P>
	   Undaunted, the leader of Hezbollah vowed more attacks with the aim of
driving Israeli forces out of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The bombing of infrastructure in Lebanon will not protect the (Israeli)
occupation troops. Rather, it will expose them to more painful strikes,''
Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah told Egypt's Al-Ahram newspaper Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   A Hezbollah legislator said Saturday that his group had not given up on
launching rockets at northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking at a rally in the city of Baalbek in eastern Lebanon, Ammar Musawi
said the settlements in northern Israel were ``tempting targets.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``If Israel wants to put an end to its losses and humiliation, it should
withdraw (from Lebanon) as soon as possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The recent fighting has seriously eroded the chances of resuming
Israeli-Syrian peace talks, which were postponed indefinitely last month. Israel
has said Syria -- the main power broker in Lebanon -- should rein in the
guerrillas if it is serious about negotiating peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Syrian state-run newspaper Tishrin said Israel would not have escalated the
conflict in Lebanon without U.S. support. Israeli arrogance, the editorial said,
``would have never reached what it has attained without the unlimited supply of
American weapons pouring into Israel and without the blind (U.S.) political
support that pampers aggression...''
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid phoned Daniel
Kurtzer, the U.S. ambassador to Egypt, to express the ``anger and condemnation
prevailing in the Arab and Muslim world toward this dangerous aggression.''
</P>
<P>
	   A statement issued by the 22-member league said Abdel-Meguid asked Kurtzer
to relay a message to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, urging the United
States to help end Israel's aggression ``in order for just and comprehensive
peace to prevail in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
	   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak also called for a resumption of peace talks
between Syria and Israel.

<HEADLINE> Gloves off in both nomination races  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - No more Mr. Nice Guys. Not George W. Bush, not John
McCain, not Bill Bradley, and certainly not Al Gore.
<P>
	   This was going to be the different campaign for the White House, positive
and polite, above attack politics and all that - until it got competitive, first
for the Democrats, then the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   The hardening line between GOP rivals Bush and McCain mirrored the earlier
shift in Democratic tactics, begun when the vice president stopped ignoring
Bradley's challenge and went after him in the fall.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time, Gore's campaign was off to a faltering beginning, so Gore
reinvented it and said he would run like an underdog.
</P>
<P>
	   He challenged Bradley to weekly campaign debates, attacked his rival's
centerpiece health care coverage proposal, and said the former New Jersey
senator was too left-of-center to win.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said that showed he was gaining ground because Gore had ignored him
for 10 months, not even mentioning the challenger. When they did debate, in
October in Hanover, N.H., Gore took the offensive, while Bradley ventured only
mild rebuttals.
</P>
<P>
	   Not now.
</P>
<P>
	   The exchanges escalated debate by debate, seven so far. In the last one,
just after Gore's victory by a 2-to-1 margin in the Iowa Democratic caucuses,
Bradley was the attacker. He accused Gore of a dishonest campaign, of coddling
special interests, of "a thousand promises and a thousand attacks."
</P>
<P>
	   After Gore's narrow victory in the New Hampshire primary, Bradley reversed
the debate challenge; now he wants them weekly.
</P>
<P>
	   But Gore already had moved past that point: He demands two a week as part of
a deal in which both candidates would stop broadcasting television commercials.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley called that a gimmick, aimed at handicapping him because he is the
lesser-known candidate. He said it was typical of old-style Washington politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said Bradley was being negative. Bradley said Gore was.
</P>
<P>
	   Which sounds like Bush vs. McCain in their argument about rival ads, each
accusing the other of breaking pledges against negative campaigning.
</P>
<P>
	   A McCain spot said Bush was twisting the truth like President Clinton. A
Bush ad said McCain was trying to mislead voters, and charged the Arizona
senator was soliciting campaign money from special interest lobbyists while
running as a reformer.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain offered to drop his hostile ads if Bush would. "Pull your ads and
we'll pull our ads and we'll all be nice guys again," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's a Washington, D.C., political trick," the Texas governor retorted.
He said he had been smeared and he meant to defend himself.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, in an abrupt change in strategy, McCain unilaterally disarmed. He
pulled from the air his ads attacking Bush after advisers determined the
commercials were compromising his campaign as a self-styled political outsider.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush did not budge. "It's a bait-and-switch trick," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Democratic campaign, Bradley is making an issue of Gore's role in the
Democratic fund-raising excesses of the 1996 campaign, saying the Republicans
could clean house on that front in the fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Back to the Republicans: McCain argues Bush would not be able to confront
Gore about his conduct because Bush does not support campaign finance reforms to
do away with unregulated donations to the political parties.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush challenges McCain's credentials as a reformer, saying that while McCain
campaigns on the issue, he is soliciting money from special interest lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush now styles himself as "a reformer with results" in Texas. McCain
dismisses the claim to his central issue.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush offensive began after he took an 18-point beating from McCain in
the New Hampshire primary Feb. 1. Bush won earlier in Iowa and then again in
Delaware last week.
</P>
<P>
	   "Somehow I got defined as the insider and he got defined as the outsider and
those days are over with," Bush said, campaigning in South Carolina, which holds
its primary Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said Bush was getting desperate.
</P>
<P>
	   It only has been a month since McCain and Bush agreed during a campaign
debate not to use attack ads.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd like to shake hands on that right now," McCain said, and they did.
Steve Forbes, for whom hard-line ads became a trademark, would not join them. No
matter; he quit the campaign for lack of support in first round of voting.
</P>
<P>
	   It was only little more than two months ago that Bush volunteered words of
praise for McCain, when McCain's temper and temperament for the White House was
being challenged.
</P>
<P>
	   "Let me say one thing, before I start, about Senator McCain," Bush prefaced
a debate answer. "He's a good man. He's a good man."
</P>
<P>
	   "Thanks," McCain said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know what compelled me to say that about you, senator," Bush said.
"He's a good friend."
</P>
<P>
	   The smile is gone now.
</P>
<P>
	   "The days of smiling and letting John McCain define me are over," Bush said.

<HEADLINE> Some Cubans Feel 'Elian Fatigue'  </HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GUTKIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- It's hard to find anyone on the streets of Havana who doesn't
think Elian Gonzalez should be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   But once they get past the party line, Cubans can be surprisingly frank
about what they think of the international custody battle over the 6-year-old
boy.
</P>
<P>
	   Some say they think Cuban President Fidel Castro is using the case for
political ends. Others say they're just plain sick of hearing about Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's the same thing all the time. It gets tiring,'' said Carlos Ortiz, a
young man who asked to end the interview when he noticed a policeman staring at
him.
</P>
<P>
	   Although opinion polls don't exist here, there's no doubt that most Cubans
believe the little boy rescued at sea and now living with a great uncle in Miami
should be returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
	   Interviewed in bars and in restaurants, on street corners and in food
markets, Cubans said failure to return Elian would amount to breaking up a
family and keeping a father from the son he loves.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not a political problem. It's a human problem,'' said 25-year-old
accountant Maryanis Romero.
</P>
<P>
	   But it's also clear that a certain amount of Elian fatigue has set in. The
island's communist government has turned the case into a major national crusade,
staging daily public rallies, bombarding the airwaves with news about the boy's
``kidnapping,'' and plastering the walls of major cities with ``Save Elian''
posters.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost every evening, Castro himself joins Elian's father and grandparents
in elaborate demonstrations for the boy's return accompanied by choir and dance
performances and speeches extolling Cuba's communist revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube in the Atlantic on Nov. 25 after
the boat he was riding in sank. His mother and 10 other people on the boat died
in an attempt to reach U.S. shores.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's U.S. relatives believe the boy should not be returned, saying his
mother died trying to bring him to freedom. Cuba says keeping him in the United
States is a violation of international law.
</P>
<P>
	   One woman, Carmen Vasquez, said she thinks Castro is capitalizing on the
Elian case to stir up revolutionary fervor and divert attention away from the
country's economic ills.
</P>
<P>
	   A man, Jorge Vasquez, recalled with amusement a rumor now making its way
through Havana that a television announcer was fired after forgetting to turn
off his microphone and saying on the air that he was sick of reading news about
Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was just saying what a lot of us think,'' Jorge said. State-run
television employees said the incident never occurred.
</P>
<P>
	   Another man, Eugenio Izquierdo, said he believed Elian's father and
grandparents, now celebrities in Cuba, were receiving economic favors from the
government, and that those privileges could end once Elian is returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Alexander Rodriguez, 24, said he doesn't understand why Elian's father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, hasn't traveled to Miami to pick up his son personally.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would go to the bowels of the earth to get my son,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rodriguez'sfriend, Keyner Piedra, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If they kidnapped his son, they could kidnap him, too,'' he insisted.
</P>
<P>
	   At that, Izquierdo said the government was wrong to call Elian's situation a
``kidnapping.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The boy was not kidnapped. He was rescued,'' he said, adding that he knows
what it's like to cross the Florida Straits in a makeshift boat because he tried
and failed to do it himself in 1979.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite such skepticism, many Cubans say they are deeply moved by Elian's
story, and consider the fact that he remains in the United States to be an
affront to their national pride.
</P>
<P>
	   They attend rallies, sometimes by the hundreds of thousands, to press for
his return. At one demonstration last week inside the walls of a Havana
fortress, hundreds of young people clamored for a chance to touch the hands of
Elian's maternal grandmother.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, they chanted: ``Fidel, for sure, hit the Yankees hard!''
</P>
<P>
	   Yet for most, it seems, the case is more about love than politics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We Cubans by idiosyncrasy are extremely tied to our families,'' said
Manuel Baltar, a 46-year-old man employed as a driver.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Seeks Converts in Calif.  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- The room was stacked against him and polls gave his
opponent nearly a 4-1 lead in the state, but Bill Bradley argued passionately
for converts Saturday at the California Democratic convention, offering a
romantic vision of the party that hopes to hold the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have in our best moments always been the party of big ideas and big
ideals,'' said Bradley. As for his opponent, Vice President Al Gore, ``There is
a difference in boldness,'' Bradley said, going first in the presidential
rivals' back-to-back speeches.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, the party favorite who filled the cavernous San Jose convention center
with activists hoisting ``Gore 2000'' placards, was speaking after a long lineup
of state officials -- party chairman Art Torres, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Sen.
Barbara Boxer, Gov. Gray Davis -- who used their turns on the massive podium to
promote the vice president's ascension.
</P>
<P>
	   In this state, which elects on March 7, 367 of the 2,170 national convention
delegates needed to clinch the Democrratic nomination, Gore is backed by all but
a handful of elected officials. Davis has pledged the work of his ``entire
operation'' in Gore's service.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nominate Al Gore!'' Boxer ordered Saturday's crowd of about 3,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley tried to make his own show of muscle, leading a march of some 500
supporters through downtown San Jose to the convention center. The party barred
entrance to most of them, allowing Bradley just 200 or so guest passes to the
convention.
</P>
<P>
	   Party officials cited space limitations, but the hall inside was nearly a
quarter empty.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley spoke of dreams, saying his goals are universal health care, the
elimination of child poverty, registration of all handguns, deeper racial
understanding, and ``a qualified teacher in every classroom in every school.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe to the bottom core of my being that the Democratic Party can be
the agent for that kind of dream, for that kind of accomplishment, as long as we
do one thing: we must not settle,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   His speech, delivered with barely a glance at his notes, left Jane Marcus
shaking and in tears. ``He tells me the truth and I believe him,'' said Marcus,
a Stanford University administrator.
</P>
<P>
	   She watched as, during Bradley's remarks, Gore aides distributed a press
release labeling Bradley a ``special agent'' of the Republican National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was appalled,'' said Marcus, who said Gore allies want to make Bradley
supporters feel like disloyal Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's dirty tricks. As a Democrat, don't I have as much a right as any
other person in this room to say who I want to be president?''

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Adapt To Threats, Blackouts  </HEADLINE>
   By RODEINA KENAAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- After the latest Israeli airstrikes, Lebanese are
hooking back up their noisy generators and filling their tubs to conserve water
-- adapting quickly to lives with power cutoffs and the threat of more punishing
raids.
</P>
<P>
	   Beirut has been transformed this week from a city famed for its nightlife to
a place where 1.2 million people cope with blackouts and water shortages, while
shrugging off the roar of Israeli jets overhead and the occasional fire of
anti-aircraft guns.
</P>
<P>
	   In a flare-up of violence this week between Hezbollah guerrillas and Israeli
troops in southern Lebanon, Israeli airstrikes Tuesday destroyed power stations
in Beirut and elsewhere. Parts of the country were plunged into darkness,
forcing the government to impose power cuts of up to 16 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
	   Apprehension then grew after Israeli officials threatened to bring the
battle once again to Beirut if guerrillas fired rockets into northern Israel.
Seven Israeli soldiers have been killed and 15 Lebanese civilians injured in the
past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   American singer Art Garfunkel, of the 1960s duo Simon and Garfunkel,
canceled a Valentine's Day concert in Beirut for security reasons. A
government-sponsored conference to promote Beirut as a media capital was
postponed. Some travelers canceled flights to Lebanon for this month's Shopping
and Tourism Festival.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let's face it. War and tourism don't go together,'' said Pierre Ashkar,
president of the Hotel Owners' Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Lebanon has recovered from such setbacks before. It did so many times during
the 1975-90 civil war. Last June, Israeli warplanes knocked out two power
stations near Beirut, forcing electricity rationing for about four months. In
1996, Israeli planes also hit the Beirut power stations.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel's strategy of hitting infrastructure in an effort to turn the
Lebanese government and public against the guerrillas isn't working this time,
either.
</P>
<P>
	   Publicly, the government backs the guerrillas, who are supported by Iran and
tolerated by Syria, but it does not involve its armed forces in the conflict,
except to fire at Israeli jets.
</P>
<P>
	   People are angry at having to deal with little electricity, hot water, heat
and having to walk up the stairs because the elevators are not working.
</P>
<P>
	   But most blame Israel, and few speak out against the guerrillas, even in
Christian areas where many saw the Israelis as their allies 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Israel hates to see our economy growing. That's why it is targeting our
infrastructure just to see us go down the drain,'' said Walid Shwaifati, a
Christian who owns several clothing and shoe stores across the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Albert Moukhaiber, an anti-Syrian Christian politician and one of the rare
dissenting voices, has criticized the government's handling of the crisis. He
has asked why Syria, which is bound to Lebanon by a friendship treaty and keeps
30,000 troops in the country, does not deploy its air force against the Israeli
planes.
</P>
<P>
	   For Wadad Khalifeh, mother of two girls aged 5 and 7, this past week's
airstrikes meant a shift to another routine.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Don't forget to bring lots of candles and batteries,'' she shouted from
her fifth-floor balcony to her husband in the street below. ``Forget the
potatoes and the oranges. They'll be too heavy for you to carry up the stairs.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the new routine, children do their homework before sundown and laundry is
done at odd hours to use limited periods of electricity and water.
</P>
<P>
	   Some families kept their children away from school for a few days, fearing
more air attacks. Many elderly and those with heart problems changed the times
they went home to avoid having to climb the stairs of high-rise apartment
buildings.	   The blackouts have put neighborhood generator operators back in
business, after some had thought of selling their machines and changing their
line of work. Now they charge hefty fees to feed electricity to homes.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the generally gloomy atmosphere, many Lebanese are confident the
attacks will not have a lasting effect.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This week, Lebanon is a nightmare. Next week, it will be different,'' said
the Lebanese promoter of the Garfunkel show, Naji Bazz.

<HEADLINE> Hillary tours NYC as an official candidate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton schmoozed and smiled her way
through New York City on Saturday, planning five campaign stops in four boroughs
in an effort to rally support from minorities and elderly voters, whose help
she'll need in her run for U.S. Senate.
<P>
	   Clinton returned to the city after a whirlwind week upstate following the
official announcement of her bid last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   She met with black Democrats and senior citizens in Queens, and made
campaign stops at the Caridad Restaurant, a Hispanic eatery in Washington
Heights; and a Democratic rally in the Bronx. She was also attending a dinner in
Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
	   The well-chosen crowds loved her.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will be behind you, and we will be able to march you on to victory in
November," U.S. Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., told a beaming Clinton before about
150 black Democrats at York College in Jamaica, Queens.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowd cheered and chanted "Hillary, Hillary, Hillary!" as Clinton vowed
to push for new jobs and affordable health care, teacher training and a tax
deduction for college tuition.
</P>
<P>
	   "She has nearly total support in the black community," said Jeff Diggs, a
Queens resident at the rally.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no choice in the black community except her," Diggs said. "Not
only is Mr. (Rudolph) Giuliani so unpopular, but the issues that she espouses
are clearly those that appeal to the black community."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton will need heavy turnout from neighborhoods like Jamaica - a working
class black enclave with a powerful Democratic organization - if she is to
defeat Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   Without mentioning the mayor by name, Clinton alluded to the criticism that
has flown between the two campaigns this week over issues like campaign
fundraising and posting the ten commandments in public school classrooms.
</P>
<P>
	   "I intend to run a campaign on issues and ideas, not on insults," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   At a Queens senior citizens residence, Clinton proposed a $3,000 tax credit
for families caring for sick or disabled relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   "Many of you know how difficult it is and exhausting to care for a loved one
who is physically or psychologically having difficulty," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   A tax credit, she argued, "will help support the diverse needs that people
have in long-term care." Clinton also said that government should provide more
services and information to such families.
</P>
<P>
	   The seniors cheered her pledges of support for Medicare, Social Security and
cheaper prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am so elated that you are here," one woman gushed. "You have my vote."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was also cheered by party stalwarts at Bronx Democratic
headquarters, where she received a jacket that said "I'm a proud Bronx
Democrat." She told supporters she was proud to be running in New York, "the
place that beckons everyone, including immigrants from Washington, D.C., like
me."

<HEADLINE> Pinochet's Condition Said Improved  </HEADLINE>
   By EDUARDO GALLARDO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Gen. Augusto Pinochet has improved slightly since a
serious worsening of his health earlier this week, a spokeswoman said Saturday,
but he remains deeply depressed.
</P>
<P>
	   The 84-year-old former Chilean dictator, who has diabetes and suffered two
small strokes recently, is refusing to eat normally, said Monica Wehrhahn, a
spokeswoman for the Pinochet Foundation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As we say, he gave up,'' she said. ``When family members call him he grabs
the phone, says hello, a couple of words, and that's all.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet was arrested in October 1998 while recuperating from back surgery
in London on a warrant by a Spanish judge who wants to try him for alleged human
rights abuses during his 17-year dictatorship. He remains under police guard at
a rented mansion west of London.
</P>
<P>
	   But British Home Secretary Jack Straw said last month that he is inclined to
release Pinochet based on a medical report that said he was unfit to stand
trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, foundation director Luis Cortes reported that Pinochet spends most
of the time in his room, refusing to come down to the first floor of the house
where he remains under police custody as his lawyers fight his extradition to
Spain.
</P>
<P>
	   The spokeswoman had reported Friday night that Pinochet suffered a ``serious
and worrisome'' crisis related to his diabetes two days earlier. ``He is doing a
little bit better today,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   A report by the civilian government that succeeded Pinochet says 3,197
people died or disappeared during the general's rule.
</P>
<P>
	   Belgium, which is also seeking Pinochet's extradition, opposed Straw's
decision and went to court demanding access to the medical report. Six human
rights groups, led by Amnesty International, filed a similar request.
</P>
<P>
	   Last Tuesday, the High Court in London accepted the right of Belgium and the
human rights organizations to argue for access to Pinochet's medical records. A
ruling is expected next week.

<HEADLINE> Siegel: Police misconduct is deeply ingrained  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Community leaders, civil rights activists and NYCLU
members from across the state converged on the city Saturday for a summit on
police brutality.
<P>
	   Opening the day-long meeting, the head of the New York Civil Liberties Union
called for a reversal in the "deeply ingrained" cop culture that he blamed for
many law enforcement ills.
</P>
<P>
	   "Police misconduct, excessive force, abuse of authority, discourtesy,
racial, ethnic and homophobic slurs have long been a serious problem with
enormous racial overtones in New York," Norman Siegel told several hundred
participants.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Al Sharpton and ex-mayor David Dinkins echoed Siegel's call.
</P>
<P>
	   "We need not to deal with this incident by incident, but through broad
systemic change," Sharpton said. "... This is not an anti-police movement, but
an anti-police brutality movement."
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years, the issue of police brutality has dominated headlines with
the 1997 assault of Abner Louima and the fatal shooting in 1999 of Amadou
Diallo. The officer who assaulted Louima pleaded guilty to violating his civil
rights, and the four officers involved in Diallo's death are currently on trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Mayor David Dinkins said that it was the government's responsibility
- not only to its citizens- but to police as well, to establish a more effective
commission to investigate police brutality.
</P>
<P>
	   "What about the morale of thousands of good cops who take their
responsibilities to heart.... What message is being sent to them by the refusal
to weed out those who undermine the confidence of those they serve?" Dinkins
asked.
</P>
<P>
	   Siegel, a frequent critic of the police department, called for the creation
of civilian review boards to oversee the police; more ethnic diversity in the
police departments; better police training; more community involvement with
police; and an end to the "blue wall of silence."
</P>
<P>
	   He cited statistics on the racial makeup of several police departments.
Upstate, in Troy, where the population is about 8 percent black, there is only
one black officer - and he's currently in training. In Westchester County's
Mount Vernon, the population is 55 percent black, but the police department is
75 percent white, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dinkins was particularly critical of the current Civilian Complaint Review
Board procedure and had harsh words for the Giuliani administration.
</P>
<P>
	   "Police conduct is not consistently condemned ... Such messages say to
officers whose inclination might be to misbehave, 'You can take liberties, you
can overstep the line, you are above the law,"' Dinkins said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We need to expose the myths about police misconduct and develop a
comprehensive program to ameliorate the problem," Siegel said, speaking at the
CUNY Center for Worker Education in lower Manhattan. "Short of that, explosive
headlines will continue to appear and more lives will be ruined."
</P>
<P>
	   The myths about brutality included assertions that such cases were often
"isolated incidents" and that they were not race-related, Siegel said.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no more pertinent and volatile issue that we have to deal with
than police brutality," Sharpton said, adding that the issue should become part
of this year's national presidential debate.
</P>
<P>
	   Citing the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr., Sharpton called on those in
attendance to band together in peaceful group action. Sharpton reminded the
audience that "there has never been a perfect time for a movement. A movement
creates its own time."

<HEADLINE> Cyanide Spill Hits Yugoslav Town  </HEADLINE>
   By MISHA SAVIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In what may be Europe's worst environmental
disaster since Chernobyl, a cyanide spill contaminating a major river has moved
into Yugoslavia and destroyed all life in the water, local officials said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The spill originated in northwest Romania, near the border town of Oradea,
where a dam at the Baia Mare gold mine overflowed Jan. 30 and caused cyanide to
pour into streams. From there, the polluted water flowed west into the Tisa
River in neighboring Hungary and then on into Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
	   Eighty percent of the fish in the Tisa have died since the contaminant
entered the country two days ago, said Mayor Atila Juhas of the northern town
Senta.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Enormous quantities of dead fish are floating on the surface, and the
spill continues to spread,'' Juhas said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
	   By Saturday noon, the concentration of cyanide in the water at the point
where Tisa enters Yugoslavia from Hungary was 0.07 milligrams per liter, down
from 0.13 milligrams several hours earlier, Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   But the worst-polluted part of the flow was moving south, and more serious
damage was expected later when the polluted waters reach the Danube River,
probably early Sunday. The spill was moving at about 2.5 mph.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Tisa is a dead river. All life in it, from algae to trout, has been
destroyed,'' said Istvan Backulin, the mayor of another affected town in the
north. ``The spill is leaving nothing alive.''
</P>
<P>
	   Officials from several northern Yugoslav towns held an emergency meeting in
Senta on Saturday, and urged locals to collect the fish in efforts to reduce
levels of the pollution.
</P>
<P>
	   Restaurants in the region have already removed fish from their menus, and
the alarm has spread south as far as the capital, Belgrade, which lies on the
Danube some 80 miles to the south.
</P>
<P>
	   Juhas said drinking water would be safe since supplies come from wells far
enough from the river. However, wildlife in the area near the river is in
serious danger, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hungary's environmental minister, Pal Pepo, said only quick action from
well-organized catastrophe-prevention work had prevented damage to human health.
</P>
<P>
	   Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban has called for the appointment of a
government commissioner to coordinate damage assessment, international legal
steps, and clean-up projects.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a European-dimension catastrophe,'' the EU transport and energy
commissioner, Loyola de Palacio, told reporters on Thursday after talks in
Budapest with Hungarian Foreign Minister Janos Martonyi.
</P>
<P>
	   Local ecologists said it could take years before marine life reappears in
the Tisa, according to Beta news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   The cyanide spill adds to the ecological strain of high pollution levels in
Yugoslavia already, caused last year by NATO bombing that targeted oil
refineries and factories.
</P>
<P>
	   Though Tanjug reported that authorities were taking ``adequate measures''
along the affected waterway, Juhas said nobody from the government in Belgrade
showed up for the Senta meeting or provided assistance.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani calls for release of national oil reserve  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, accusing President Clinton of
ignoring the pain of New Yorkers, called Saturday for the release of the
country's oil reserve to offset this winter's staggering increase in home
heating oil costs.
<P>
	   Clinton was "clearly turning his back on the suffering of all New Yorkers
around the state," the mayor said at City Hall. "What I've learned is that the
only way to reach the White House is to make it a political issue."
</P>
<P>
	   White House deputy press secretary Jim Kennedy responded that selling the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve to lower oil prices was not allowed by law.
</P>
<P>
	   "The president has taken strong measures to help struggling families pay
their energy bills," Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer contradicted Kennedy, saying sale of the reserve
was legal in an emergency. The Clinton administration has not labeled the
current situation as meeting that standard.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani released a three-paragraph letter that he sent to the White House,
urging the sale of a portion of the reserve to create competition that would
drive prices down.
</P>
<P>
	   Many other politicians in the Northeast, including Schumer, have also called
on the president to provide relief for the oil prices.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, which pays the nation's highest home heating oil costs, the
price per gallon has shot up from 72 cents to $2.50 since the first of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Schumer said he welcomed Giuliani's efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   "My attitude is, 'The more, the merrier,"' said Schumer, who first called
for sale of the reserve in September. "We can use all the support we can get."
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani estimated the drastic increase would end up costing the city as
much as $14 million, while the average New Yorker would pay an extra $350 this
winter to heat their home.
</P>
<P>
	   "New Yorkers are feeling real pain," Giuliani said. "Unfortunately,
President Clinton is not feeling the pain of New Yorkers."
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani's shots at Clinton came as first lady Hillary Clinton, his opponent
in November's U.S. Senate election, made campaign stops in four of the city's
five boroughs. Asked about Giuliani's latest move, Mrs. Clinton's spokesman
Howard Wolfson said "I'm not going to respond to Mayor Giuliani."
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor urged the sale of 2 percent of the reserve to lower oil prices.
The prices began soaring after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
rolled back production by 4.3 million barrels a day last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal government earlier this week announced $130 million in
assistance to help the indigent cover their heating costs. But Energy Secretary
William Richardson said there were no plans to sell the reserve.

<HEADLINE> Plane Crashes Take Toll on Rescuers  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTINE HANLEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- In an instant, Rachel Fowler can recall the
horrifying details: the floating teddy bears, children's clothes and shoes. All
it takes to trigger the memories is the sight of a toy. Or another plane crash.
</P>
<P>
	   Just three months prior to the crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261, Fowler
was among the first to view wreckage of a doomed EgyptAir jetliner, which
slammed into the Atlantic, killing all 217 on board.
</P>
<P>
	   Fowler, a 20-year-old Coast Guard seaman, remembers the sleeplessness and,
in place of that, the nightmares.
</P>
<P>
	   Counseling and support from fellow crew members and family helped her
overcome some of the aftershock, but they haven't enabled her to entirely
forget.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was on this boat when I first saw the news (about Alaska Airlines). I
picked up the phone and called a friend to see if they had seen it,'' Fowler
said from the USCGC Monomoy, based in Woods Hole, Mass. ``It's very upsetting.''
</P>
<P>
	   When Flight 261 crashed on Jan. 31, killing all 88 on board, the Coast Guard
crew at Channel Islands station joined a fraternity no one seeks out.
</P>
<P>
	   Uniforms aside, the search-and-rescuers are people with names, families, and
stories -- just like the victims they carry home from the seas after these
disasters.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the Channel Islands crew is Larry O'Donnell, an old-school sailor.
Mitzi Boughner can hold her own at sea -- and run circles around some of the
guys on the basketball court. Andy Jones is a well-respected, compassionate dad,
and Marshall Glickman, a high-spirited and polite young man, just got married.
</P>
<P>
	   All of them -- along with reinforcements -- went to work when Flight 261
took its plunge. Fighting off emotions and exhaustion, they piled every last
grim detail onto their decks, bouyed by hope for a miracle.
</P>
<P>
	   Now they, like everyone else, are settling back into routines.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was kind of like a bad movie, like a dream state you're in,'' said Matt
Vaughn, a matter-of-fact 23-year-old. ``It's really sad. But it's one of those
things, when it happens, you have to go through it.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Work began when a ranger on Anacapa Island reported seeing a plane fall from
the sky at 4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   The station's 44-foot motor lifeboat was dispatched at once, carrying four
men. A lighter 41-foot utility boat followed minutes later, with Vaughn and five
others aboard. Cruising in swells of 6 to 8 feet, they wondered whether there
had been a crash at all.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In my mind, I was thinking, if anything, it was a small plane crash out of
Oxnard,'' Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Back at the station, Chief Warrant Officer Randy Mitchell and Lt. Cmdr. J.J.
Jones were trying to hold down the fort. Both had gone home for the day before
the crash was reported. By the time they got back, the switchboard was lit up
and the media had arrived.
</P>
<P>
	   They weren't used to the attention. Until now, they had existed in obscurity
in a town centered around a Navy base. And most of the calls were routine:
occasional drownings, disabled boats, man overboards.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitchell knew how traumatic it had been as soon as the men got back.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I saw it in their eyes when they stepped off the boats,'' he said. ``They
had that empty stare. They were like zombies.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   As workers aboard the two Coast Guard boats plied waters thick with wreckage
and reeking of jet fuel, their hopes of finding survivors faded faster than the
setting sun.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were focusing on finding people, rushing around trying to find
anyone,'' Glickman said. ``We all pretty much knew from the size of the debris,
that to find a survivor would be a godly thing.''
</P>
<P>
	   They picked up everything -- plane parts, luggage, seats, shoes and bathing
suits. Glickman's boat picked up a chart bag sealed with flight plans and a pair
of prayer books. Vaughn picked up an ice chest, engraved with ``M. Thompson,''
later making a connection when Morrie Thompson's photo appeared in his local
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   And then -- a baby.
</P>
<P>
	   The crew of Vaughn's boat spotted the child just adrift of its bow. The
infant was covered in a blanket after it was swept to the deck.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It hit home for a lot of people. Especially for the younger guys. It was
tough for them,'' Vaughn said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Mark Fedor, commander of the USCGC Monomoy at the EgyptAir crash,
witnessed much of the same.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I guess they were the things you could really emotionally connect to,'' he
said. ``People with kids, it reminded them of their own.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the Coast Guard's Critical Incident Stress Management Team were
ready to greet the first crews. The unit, similar to those with police and fire
departments, was put into full swing in the 1996 crash of TWA Flight 800.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In this instance, they pulled hundreds of remains out of the water,'' said
Tiffani Collier, the team's coordinator. ``No matter how much training someone
has, no one is ready for doing this kind of work.''
</P>
<P>
	   Feelings of guilt or failure for not doing their job -- saving lives -- can
be magnified by the sheer size of the disaster. Eighty-eight people killed means
88 people who weren't rescued.
</P>
<P>
	   Flashbacks, nightmares or irritability are common, and can last months and
even longer. The best therapy is to talk things out.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We remind them that they are the best support system for each other,''
Collier said.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Vaughn and Glickman recalled how their work grew more stressful and hopeless
as that first night wore on.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We kept saying it would be nice to find at least one person alive -- at
least give us some hope,'' Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
	   They were relieved of duty about six hours after they started, soaking wet
and coated in grime.
</P>
<P>
	   To help rid the events from his head, Vaughn replayed them before falling
asleep. He dreamed of being on the plane and ``going through the steps'' the
passengers might have gone through before the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I try thinking about it as much as I can right off the bat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He was back at the crack of dawn, along with Glickman, resuming a slot in a
rotation that would last until the next morning, when they swept the shores of
Anacapa Island. Even then, they hoped.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were let down in a way. But you try not to let it beat you up to
much,'' Vaughn said. ``You would hope that if something like that happened to
you, somebody would do for you what we did for these people.''
</P>
<P>
	   The very next day, the Channel Islands station got a call. A fisherman was
missing. They launched a helicopter and a boat, and went looking for someone to
rescue.

<HEADLINE> McCain Revs Up Campaign in S.C.  </HEADLINE>
   By LEIGH STROPE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DARLINGTON, S.C. (AP) -- John McCain hit 100 mph in a spin around
Darlington's famed speedway Saturday and George W. Bush told people in Columbia
he's ``a tough competitor'' who doesn't like losing.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain kept his campaign in high gear with several town meetings and other
stops the rest of the weekend. Bush made a couple of campaign stops in the
state, before heading back to Austin to spend some time with family, returning
to the campaign trail on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   As Bush was telling an audience at a Columbia restaurant that ``my faith
allowed me to handle a short-term adversity,'' McCain was hopping behind the
wheel of a blue Pontiax Grand Prix NASCAR's Darlington Raceway for a few turns
around the track Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The most important news of the day is I went over 100 miles an hour,''
McCain said. ``I hope I do a better job driving this car than I did on my last
mission.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was a Vietnam POW after his plane was shot down over Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
	   The candidate jumped in the car wearing a suit and tie -- but not a helmet
-- and had his wife Cindy in the passenger seat. He gave a thumbs-up to track
officials and reporters before flooring the gas pedal, kicking up dust in his
wake. He took two laps around the track, stopping once for photographers, and
then emerged from the car with a huge grin.
</P>
<P>
	   The Darlington track has a rich tradition in South Carolina politics. Bob
Dole in 1995 explored the early stages of his presidential bid here and other
candidates have made the mandatory campaign stop at Darlington. The track is in
the heart of tobacco country, where McCain's sponsorship of failed legislation
to raise taxes on tobacco has been a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier the Arizona senator walked through a neighborhood in nearby
Florence, knocking on doors and asking for votes. He surprised Steve Coker, who
answered his door with his children peering from behind him, hiding from the
television cameras.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He'll let all his work show,'' Coker said of McCain. ``We know all about
the Keating Five, we know he's divorced, we're not guessing about his drug
use.''
</P>
<P>
	   Both campaigns on Saturday were still preoccupied with campaign tactics,
trading attacks on everything from push polling to rude telephone calls to
fund-raising. Bush told reporters Saturday that his campaign has hearing from
supporters that they're getting calls from someone claiming to be with the Bush
campaign, who starts ``trashmouthing'' the person answering the phone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I warn the people of South Carolina, Republicans, if you get a phone call
from some voice purporting to be me that is rude, just ignore it,'' Bush said.
``I can assure you our people are not calling to make it hard for me to win the
election.''
</P>
<P>
	   A Newsweek poll out Saturday showed the race was a dead heat, with Bush
doing better among Republicans and McCain better among independents.
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire, McCain rode his strong support from both groups to an
18-point victory. Bush said Saturday that his faith sustained him after his loss
there. But he told the crowd of about 100 at Seawell's Restaurant that he's wary
of people in public office who say: ``Vote for me, I'm more religious than my
neighbor.'''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Faith, to me, is strength. It puts life in perspective. I recognize that
I'm a humble sinner and I've sought redemption, and I recognize that I'm no
better than anybody else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   After his visit to the capital city of Columbia, Bush traveled to Orangeburg
for a speech and question-and-answer session.
</P>
<P>
	   Then he flew back to Texas to spend Sunday with his family. Bush planned to
spend the rest of the week in South Carolina after his return on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Tensions Heighten in Montenegro  </HEADLINE>
   By JOVANA GEC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The debate over breaking away from Yugoslavia
is splitting Montenegro's families, friends, regions and towns, and raising
worries not only of intervention by the federal army but of war among the
Montenegrins themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   Those tensions have heightened since last Monday's killing of Yugoslav
Defense Minister Pavle Bulatovic, one of the most senior Montenegrins in
President Slobodan Milosevic's regime in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
	   Although no one has openly accused pro-independence Montenegrins of the
crime, Milosevic's supporters here in Montenegro are portraying Bulatovic's
killing as an attack on the integrity of the country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The divisions are very sharp,'' said political analyst Miodrag Vlahovic.
``They are irrational, but there is not much room for dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
	   Montenegro, a mountainous republic of 600,000 people that affords Yugoslavia
its last outlet to the Adriatic Sea, stuck by the federation as Slovenia,
Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia broke away one-by-one in the 1990s,
all but Macedonia in bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
	   Talk of independence increased after Milosevic's pro-Western rival, Milo
Djukanovic, won Montenegro's presidency in a 1997 election victory over a
pro-Belgrade candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Apart from complaining about domination by the larger Serbia, secession
proponents argue that Yugoslavia's international isolation over the Balkans wars
prevents Montenegro from implementing economic and political reforms and blocks
access to international lending bodies.
</P>
<P>
	   But worries about civil war within Montenegro, fears of action by
Milosevic's forces and lack of Western support for secession have slowed plans
for a referendum on independence.
</P>
<P>
	   Rather than push the issue to open conflict, Montenegro's government has
opted for ``creeping independence.'' It has slowly taken over federal
institutions such as customs and border control and has introduced the German
mark as a parallel currency to the devalued Yugoslav dinar.
</P>
<P>
	   That leaves the Yugoslav military units within Montenegro as the only
visible federal institution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Yugoslav federation exists only formally, only on the map,'' said
Novak Kilibarda, one of Montenegro's deputy prime ministers. ``All ties have
been suspended. A referendum is a certainty which has to be carried out. But
maybe not immediately.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, tensions are bubbling in almost every facet of Montenegrin life,
even the national sports club, Buducnost, which sponsors soccer and basketball
teams. Its fan club has split into pro-independence and pro-Belgrade factions,
and police had to separate two groups of fans during a recent basketball game
with a visiting Israeli team.
</P>
<P>
	   The Montenegrin government claims Milosevic's supporters are fomenting
divisions within the republic, arming militias to fight alongside federal troops
if necessary and provoking incidents, such as the brief military takeover last
year of the main airport at Podgorica, Montenegro's capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Predrag Bulatovic, a top official in the pro-Milosevic Socialist People's
Party, dismisses such accusations. He argues it is the Montenegrin government
that is preparing for war by forming a 20,000-man police force -- much larger
than necessary for routine security.
</P>
<P>
	   But even while denying pro-Milosevic militias had been formed, Bulatovic
warned that pro-Belgrade Montenegrins would ``organize themselves'' and
``respond to force with force'' if the republic's government holds a referendum
on secession.
</P>
<P>
	   Such talk is reminiscent to the situations before the earlier Yugoslav wars,
when Serb minorities took up arms after declarations of independence by Croatia
and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Milosevic supported the Serb insurgents politically and
militarily.
</P>
<P>
	   Milan Popovic, a law professor, estimates about half of Montenegro's
families are divided over the republic's future.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some Montenegrins say they are Serbs; some call themselves Montenegrins,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Most pro-Serb Montenegrins come from extended families with ancestral roots
in the north near the border with Serbia. Pro-independence strength is mostly in
the south, while the central parts, including the capital, are mixed.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent surveys, about 30 percent of Montenegrins said they wanted the
republic to remain with Serbia ``at any price.'' An equal percentage supported
independence. The rest were undecided.
</P>
<P>
	   Many people fear that the longer the issue remains unresolved, the greater
the possibility of open conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A war here would be a war to the end, father against son, brother against
brother,'' economist Nebojsa Medojevic said.

<HEADLINE> Immigration Law Ensnares Mother  </HEADLINE>
   By PEGGY ANDERSEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- On Valentine's Day, it will be exactly five months since
Emma Mendez de Hay was arrested by immigration officials on her return from a
trip to meet her fiance's family in Italy.
</P>
<P>
	   She's been in an Immigration and Naturalization Service detention facility
in Louisiana ever since. On Thursday, a judge there ordered her deported to her
native Mexico, where she hasn't lived for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
	   De Hay, a legal U.S. resident with a green card, has run afoul of a 1996
immigration law -- spurred in part by the World Trade Center bombing -- intended
to tighten U.S. borders against dangerous criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   The 39-year-old mother of four and her attorney, Glen Prior, don't believe
the law was intended to protect the nation from people like her. But as the law
is written, there is no flexibility.
</P>
<P>
	   De Hay admits she made a ``stupid mistake'' in 1990. A Spanish-speaking
cousin staying at her home in Puyallup, near Tacoma, asked her to speak to a
person who had telephoned.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Tell him I can't help him today,'' the cousin said. ``I'll help him
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
	   Because her cousin did not speak English well, de Hay said she passed on the
message.
</P>
<P>
	   The next day, she was visited by federal agents: The caller was an
undercover officer, and the call was about cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1992, de Hay pleaded guilty to a felony charge of using a communication
device to facilitate the distribution of cocaine. She cooperated with
authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Emma was promised a recommendation of not being incarcerated, as well as
not being deported and taken away from her entire family,'' her attorney in that
case, Erik Bauer, wrote in a recent letter to Prior. ``It is a travesty of
justice that the government is now trying to deport her.''
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1992, de Hay and her sister ran and sold a restaurant. After the trip
to Italy, she planned to take classes to prepare for work as a translator --
work she'd already begun as a volunteer at clinics and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
	   So she was mystified when INS agents stopped her in New York when she
returned from Italy on Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I never thought I would get in trouble like this, especially 10 years
later,'' de Hay said.
</P>
<P>
	   She is most concerned for her two youngest children, 10- and 13-year-old
boys now staying with family members in the Puget Sound area, and her
77-year-old mother, who has been hospitalized for complications from heart
disease and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
	   Her 20-year-old daughter, Vanessa Hay, an honor student at Pierce College,
has dropped out to get a job and cover the family bills.
</P>
<P>
	   De Hay has considered giving up and returning to Mexico, though she has no
family there. She didn't seek citizenship after her 1992 conviction for fear it
would stir up trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't have nothing to go to Mexico for,'' she said. ``All my family
lives here.''
</P>
<P>
	   Prior says the Board of Immigration Appeals could take more than a year to
review the case -- and the law bars de Hay's release on bond.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1996 law -- the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility
Act -- expanded the list of ``aggravated felonies'' that prompt deportation, and
allowed deportation to be applied retroactively to crimes committed before the
law was passed.
</P>
<P>
	   It also made deportation automatic. Once deported, Prior says, de Hay could
be jailed for 20 years if she tried to re-enter the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Some members of Congress are trying to amend the law, which even the INS
says is inflexible.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We feel there needs to be more discretion available to immigration judges
when they review cases,'' said agency spokesman Bill Strassberger in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Waivers -- based on the crime committed, how long they've been here, what
kind of behavior they've had since, hardship on families -- can't be considered
now.''
</P>
<P>
	   A bill offered by Reps. Bob McCollum, R-Fla., and Lincoln Diaz-Balart,
R-Texas, would allow the U.S. attorney general to waive automatic deportation
and allow a hearing if there is no danger to person or property, said McCollum's
spokeswoman, Susan Dryden.
</P>
<P>
	   A measure by Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., and other Democrats would restore
discretion for immigration judges and ``allow them to take into account the life
of the people we're talking about,'' said his spokesman, Peter Kovar.
</P>
<P>
	   The American Immigration Lawyers Association in Washington, part of a ``Fix
'96'' effort to amend the measure, say there is also limited opportunity for
judicial review under the law.
</P>
<P>
	   Essentially, no court has jurisdiction over deportation orders, though some
have made it to appellate courts with mixed results, said Matt Tallman of the
association. And non-citizens do not have many of the constitutional protections
enjoyed by citizens, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   De Hay's lawyer hopes to transfer jurisdiction and appeal the deportation to
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals -- a move that might at least get de Hay
to a detention center in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At least if I was closer my children could come and visit me,'' she said.
``Even though I really wouldn't like them to see me in jail.''

<HEADLINE> TWA: MD-80 Pump Problem Unrelated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- The failure of a hydraulic pump on board a TWA MD-80 had
nothing to do with safety issues raised by the recent Alaska Airlines crash, TWA
officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   TWA flight 299 made its scheduled landing in Phoenix on Friday night,
repaired the problem and continued on to San Diego, said Jim Brown, a spokesman
for St. Louis-based TWA. The departure for San Diego was delayed 1 1/2 hours, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane is of the same class of aircraft that crashed off the southern
California coast and killed 88 people.
</P>
<P>
	   But the TWA jet's problem was with its hydraulic system, not its horizontal
stabilizer, the system targeted in the Alaska Airlines investigation, Brown
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The hydraulic system has nothing to with flight control and there is a
backup system, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fact is that the media is very sensitive to covering any issue related
to the MD-80 no matter how minor it is,'' Brown said. ``There was no safety
issue there.''

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Albanians Flee Serb Area  </HEADLINE>
   By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Despite new security measures, ethnic
Albanians fled from the Serb part of this city Saturday, complaining that angry
Serbs had forced them to leave and that the United Nations was powerless to stop
it.
</P>
<P>
	   An ethnic Albanian human rights group demanded French peacekeepers leave
Kosovska Mitrovica because they had lost control to ``Serb criminals.'' Late
Saturday, French and Danish troops closed a cafe which was a hangout for Serb
extremists after a search of the establishment turned up no weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   Kosovo's most multiethnic city has been wracked by violence since a grenade
attack last week on a U.N. bus killed two elderly Serbs.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, Serbs have been forcing ethnic Albanians to leave their homes in
the northern part of the city despite appeals by U.N. chief administrator
Bernard Kouchner and others. On Friday, Kouchner announced new security
measures, including more police and U.N. troops to protect the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
	   Kouchner's announcement, however, did little to calm the deteriorating
situation. Ethnic Albanians, carrying a few belongings in plastic bags, lumbered
Saturday across the bridge over the Ibar River to the safety of the southern,
Albanian-dominated side.
</P>
<P>
	   Sylejman Deliv said about 20 bearded Serb men came to his apartment building
at 5 a.m., banged on the apartments of ethnic Albanian residents and ordered
them to leave immediately or ``we will kill you.''
</P>
<P>
	   Deliv said the terrified residents telephoned the U.N. civilian police.
``But they didn't do anything,'' so the residents left.
</P>
<P>
	   Sylejman Plana, 55, and his wife, Advie, 52, said they were expelled earlier
in the week but tried to return to their apartment to pick up personal
belongings. After peacekeepers refused to escort them home, the couple returned
to the north side on their own.
</P>
<P>
	   Sylejman Plana said they were intercepted by Serbs ``who beat me'' and
turned them back.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not enough to have just one policeman,'' he said as he stood,
bewildered, on the bridge trying to decide what to do next. ``They will attack
us. They will kill us.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear how many of the estimated 4,500 ethnic Albanians living in
the Serb area had been expelled during the past week. The U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees said Friday that about 650 ethnic Albanians had registered with the
United Nations for humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
	   Many others probably did not bother to register and simply moved in with
friends or relatives in the ethnic Albanian part of the city, U.N. officials
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Halit Berani, head of the local ethnic Albanian ``Committee for the Defense
of Human Rights,'' said that, over the past two days, a total of 71 expulsion
cases had been reported to his group.
</P>
<P>
	   He urged NATO to remove the French troops from the city.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The French army and U.N. police left the positions they were at, they
withdrew and they didn't do anything,'' he said. ``The Serb criminals then had
their hands free to do whatever they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
	   A French spokesman, Lt. Col. Patrick Chanliau, described the situation in
the city Saturday as ``calm but tense.'' He said someone threw a grenade and
opened fire late Friday at a Serb house in the north of the city, but there were
no injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the increased security, Kouchner said the United Nations would
enforce a decree issued last year authorizing police and troops to expel from
the city or even the province any ``troublemakers'' who foment discord.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said a ``security zone'' would be established where public protests
would be banned.
</P>
<P>
	   About 140 British reinforcements have moved into the city, joining 150
German, Dutch and Italian reinforcements that already had arrived. Several U.N.
policemen have complained that the French were slow to respond when the violence
exploded last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere, NATO said an American peacekeeper, whose name was not released,
was in stable condition Saturday after suffering a gunshot wound to the leg late
Friday. An Army spokeswoman, Maj Debbie Allen, said investigators were looking
into whether the wound was accidentally self-inflicted.
</P>
<P>
	   Three ethnic Albanians were arrested after shooting in the direction of
Norwegian soldiers near Obilic, NATO said. No one was hurt. Also Friday, a
vehicle carrying Russian soldiers struck a dynamite device buried along a road
near Glogovac in central Kosovo, NATO said. There were no injuries, but the
vehicle was heavily damaged.

<HEADLINE> Four Accused of Sierra Leone Plot  </HEADLINE>
   By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- West African peacekeepers said Saturday they
have arrested four former soldiers who plotted to kill Sierra Leone's ex-junta
leader to undermine the country's fragile peace accord.
</P>
<P>
	   The soldiers were arrested Thursday at the Freetown residence of ex-junta
leader Johnny Paul Koroma, said Lt. Col. Chris Olukolade, spokesman for the
Nigerian-led West African intervention force known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
	   Koroma uncovered the alleged plot among his followers and turned them in,
Olukolade said. Olukolade did not give details of the plot, but said the
suspects were cooperating with authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   The four men -- George Johnson, Fodaybah Marah, Ibrahim Kamara and Foday
Kamanda -- are all well-known bush commanders based in the Okra Hills, near
Freetown.
</P>
<P>
	   Koroma's ex-junta soldiers are nominally allied to the country's brutal
rebel movement, which killed tens of thousands of people and hacked off arms,
legs and lips of many others during a grisly eight-year war to unseat the
government.
</P>
<P>
	   A peace accord was signed in July. But now many rebels and ex-junta soldiers
accuse their leaders, Koroma and rebel chief Foday Sankoh, of abandoning them
after securing government posts in a coalition government under the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, many rebels and ex-junta soldiers have refused to give up their guns,
as required by the deal. Cease-fire violations are commonplace, and U.N. human
rights experts have reported cases of rebels looting villages, burning houses,
raping women and mutilating civilians in former rebel-held towns. Some
disgruntled fighters openly admit to using their weapons to terrorize and rob
villagers, calling that their only means of survival after the unsatisfactory
peace deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Rebels have refused to allow ECOMOG troops and their counterparts in a U.N.
peacekeeping force to enter much of the rebel-held North and East. The U.N.
force began deploying last November and is eventually expected to number at
least 6,000 troops.

<HEADLINE> Bradley argues for converts at California Democratic Convention  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) - The room was stacked against him and polls gave
his opponent nearly a 4-1 lead in the state, but Bill Bradley argued
passionately for converts Saturday at the California Democratic convention,
offering a romantic vision of the party that hopes to hold the White House.
<P>
	   "We have in our best moments always been the party of big ideas and big
ideals," said Bradley. As for his opponent, Vice President Al Gore, "There is a
difference in boldness," Bradley said, going first in the presidential rivals'
back-to-back speeches.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, the party favorite who filled the cavernous San Jose convention center
with activists hoisting "Gore 2000" placards, was speaking after a long lineup
of state officials - party chairman Art Torres, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Sen.
Barbara Boxer, Gov. Gray Davis - who used their turns on the massive podium to
promote the vice president's ascension.
</P>
<P>
	   In this state, which elects on March 7, 367 of the 2,170 national convention
delegates needed to clinch the Democrratic nomination, Gore is backed by all but
a handful of elected officials. Davis has pledged the work of his "entire
operation" in Gore's service.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nominate Al Gore!" Boxer ordered Saturday's crowd of about 3,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley tried to make his own show of muscle, leading a march of some 500
supporters through downtown San Jose to the convention center. The party barred
entrance to most of them, allowing Bradley just 200 or so guest passes to the
convention.
</P>
<P>
	   Party officials cited space limitations, but the hall inside was nearly a
quarter empty.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley spoke of dreams, saying his goals are universal health care, the
elimination of child poverty, registration of all handguns, deeper racial
understanding, and "a qualified teacher in every classroom in every school."
</P>
<P>
	   "I believe to the bottom core of my being that the Democratic Party can be
the agent for that kind of dream, for that kind of accomplishment, as long as we
do one thing: we must not settle," Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   His speech, delivered with barely a glance at his notes, left Jane Marcus
shaking and in tears. "He tells me the truth and I believe him," said Marcus, a
Stanford University administrator.
</P>
<P>
	   She watched as, during Bradley's remarks, Gore aides distributed a press
release labeling Bradley a "special agent" of the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was appalled," said Marcus, who said Gore allies want to make Bradley
supporters feel like disloyal Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's dirty tricks. As a Democrat, don't I have as much a right as any other
person in this room to say who I want to be president?"

<HEADLINE> Screamin' Jay Hawkins Dies at Age 70  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Screamin' Jay Hawkins, a renowned American blues singer and
pianist, died Saturday at the age of 70 following an operation earlier in the
week, a doctor said.
</P>
<P>
	   The musician, whose real name was Jalacy Hawkins, died at the Ambroise Pave
clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a suburb west of Paris. He had suffered multiple
organ failure following emergency surgery to treat an aneurysm, the doctor, who
requested anonymity, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Hawkins, from Cleveland, was best known for his song ``I Put a Spell On
You,'' which he recorded on the Okeh label in 1956. He had originally planned
the tune as a ballad, but after a night of heavy drinking he took another crack
-- screaming, yelling and groaning -- and never looked back.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of his groans had to be edited out so that ``I Put a Spell On You''
could be played on the radio. Hawkins once said the song, written to woo back a
girlfriend, was at first banned by some radio stations because it supposedly
sounded cannibalistic.
</P>
<P>
	   Hawkins went on to use the same demented style again and again. An
outrageous performer, he used bizarre stage props, often emerging out of coffins
during shows. His constant on-stage companion: a flaming skull named Henry.
</P>
<P>
	   Hawkins got his first break in 1951 as a pianist-valet to veteran jazz
guitarist Tiny Grimes. His recording debut was 1952's ``Why Did You Waste My
Time,'' backed by Grimes and his Rockin' Highlanders.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1960s, Hawkins recorded the hits ``Alligator Wine,'' ``Feast of the
Mau Mau'' and ``I Hear Voices.'' In more recent years, he appeared in the films
``Mystery Train'' and ``A Rage in Harlem.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Revs Up Campaign in S.C.  </HEADLINE>
   By LEIGH STROPE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DARLINGTON, S.C. (AP) -- John McCain hit 100 mph in a spin around
Darlington's famed speedway Saturday and George W. Bush told people in Columbia
he's ``a tough competitor'' who doesn't like losing.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain kept his campaign in high gear with several town meetings and other
stops the rest of the weekend. Bush made a couple of campaign stops in the
state, before heading back to Austin to spend some time with family, returning
to the campaign trail on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   As Bush was telling an audience at a Columbia restaurant that ``my faith
allowed me to handle a short-term adversity,'' McCain was hopping behind the
wheel of a blue Pontiax Grand Prix NASCAR's Darlington Raceway for a few turns
around the track Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The most important news of the day is I went over 100 miles an hour,''
McCain said. ``I hope I do a better job driving this car than I did on my last
mission.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was a Vietnam POW after his plane was shot down over Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
	   The candidate jumped in the car wearing a suit and tie -- but not a helmet
-- and had his wife Cindy in the passenger seat. He gave a thumbs-up to track
officials and reporters before flooring the gas pedal, kicking up dust in his
wake. He took two laps around the track, stopping once for photographers, and
then emerged from the car with a huge grin.
</P>
<P>
	   The Darlington track has a rich tradition in South Carolina politics. Bob
Dole in 1995 explored the early stages of his presidential bid here and other
candidates have made the mandatory campaign stop at Darlington. The track is in
the heart of tobacco country, where McCain's sponsorship of failed legislation
to raise taxes on tobacco has been a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier the Arizona senator walked through a neighborhood in nearby
Florence, knocking on doors and asking for votes. He surprised Steve Coker, who
answered his door with his children peering from behind him, hiding from the
television cameras.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He'll let all his work show,'' Coker said of McCain. ``We know all about
the Keating Five, we know he's divorced, we're not guessing about his drug
use.''
</P>
<P>
	   Both campaigns on Saturday were still preoccupied with campaign tactics,
trading attacks on everything from push polling to rude telephone calls to
fund-raising. Bush told reporters Saturday that his campaign has hearing from
supporters that they're getting calls from someone claiming to be with the Bush
campaign, who starts ``trashmouthing'' the person answering the phone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I warn the people of South Carolina, Republicans, if you get a phone call
from some voice purporting to be me that is rude, just ignore it,'' Bush said.
``I can assure you our people are not calling to make it hard for me to win the
election.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush did not blame the calls on McCain. Earlier in the week, McCain demanded
that the Bush campaign stop calling voters and misleading them about his record
after a woman complained her 14-year-old son received such a call. The woman
didn't know if the Bush campaign had made the call.
</P>
<P>
	   A Newsweek poll out Saturday showed the race was a dead heat, with Bush
doing better among Republicans and McCain better among independents.
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire, McCain rode his strong support from both groups to an
18-point victory. Bush said Saturday that his faith sustained him after his loss
there. But he told the crowd of about 100 at Seawell's Restaurant that he's wary
of people in public office who say: ``Vote for me, I'm more religious than my
neighbor.'''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Faith, to me, is strength. It puts life in perspective. I recognize that
I'm a humble sinner and I've sought redemption, and I recognize that I'm no
better than anybody else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   After his visit to the capital city of Columbia, Bush traveled to Orangeburg
for a speech and question-and-answer session.
</P>
<P>
	   Then he flew back to Texas to spend Sunday with his family. Bush planned to
spend the rest of the week in South Carolina after his return on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Annan Upbeat on Cambodia Mission  </HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW PENNINGTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said Saturday he
was optimistic a new U.N. mission to Cambodia could resolve differences with the
government over establishing a tribunal to try surviving leaders of the Khmer
Rouge.
</P>
<P>
	   Prime Minister Hun Sen was also upbeat. ``The two sides agree that the door
is still open for discussions,'' he told reporters after a 30 minute meeting
with Annan on the sidelines of a major U.N. trade conference in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations has been at loggerheads with Cambodia for months over
international participation in a tribunal to judge Khmer Rouge chieftains, under
whose communist rule in the late 1970s an estimated 1.7 million Cambodians died
from starvation, disease and execution.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. blessing is crucial to Hun Sen for the tribunal to be viewed by the
world community as legitimate. There are concerns that Cambodia's corrupt and
politicized judiciary would be open to manipulation by the dominant premier, who
has cut deals with Khmer Rouge to end two decades of civil war.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan hoped that a U.N. legal team going soon to Phnom Penh would be able to
resolve ``all outstanding issues,'' including the participation of foreign
judges. ``Nothing is off the table,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The mood was upbeat after a week during which both sides issued statements
digging their heels in.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan's spokesman said Friday that the secretary-general would be laying
down the ``bottom line'' of what was required to get U.N. backing in Saturday's
meeting, suggesting there was little more room for compromise.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Hun Sen accused the United Nations on Friday of treating Cambodia
no better than a dog guarding a prize catch. He asserted Cambodia should be able
to run the tribunal on its own terms after fighting the Khmer Rouge for decades
and arresting and jailing the suspects.
</P>
<P>
	   But after the meeting with Annan -- their second in five months -- Hun Sen
said they had overcome misunderstandings sown through the media and a recent
exchange of letters between the United Nations and Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
	   This week Annan sent a letter to the Cambodian government rejecting Hun
Sen's latest tribunal plan, which would give Cambodia a majority of judges on a
joint panel, although it would require the agreement of at least one foreign
judge for a ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cambodian plan would also require indictments to be issued by
co-prosecutors, a formula critics say would give the Cambodian judiciary veto
power over prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. wants prosecutors to be able to issue indictments independently of
each other.
</P>
<P>
	   The lingering dispute over the tribunal is holding up attempts both to
arrest several Khmer Rouge leaders living freely in Cambodia, and to put on
trial the two held in custody. The leaders are accused of causing one in five
Cambodians to die during a reign of terror between 1975 and 1979.
</P>
<P>
	   The Khmer Rouge were ousted from power by a Vietnamese invasion, but waged
guerrilla war against successive governments until finally collapsing in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Hillary tours NYC as an official candidate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton schmoozed and smiled her way
through New York City on Saturday, planning five campaign stops in all five
boroughs in an effort to rally support from minorities and elderly voters, whose
help she'll need in her run for U.S. Senate.
<P>
	   Clinton returned to the city after a whirlwind week upstate following the
official announcement of her bid last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   She met with black Democrats and senior citizens in Queens, and made
campaign stops at the Caridad Restaurant, a Hispanic eatery in Washington
Heights; and a Democratic rally in the Bronx. She was also expected to stop in
Brooklyn before attending a dinner in Staten Island Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The well-chosen crowds loved her.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will be behind you, and we will be able to march you on to victory in
November," U.S. Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., told a beaming Clinton before about
150 black Democrats at York College in Jamaica, Queens.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowd cheered and chanted "Hillary, Hillary, Hillary!" as Clinton vowed
to push for new jobs and affordable health care, teacher training and a tax
deduction for college tuition.
</P>
<P>
	   "She has nearly total support in the black community," said Jeff Diggs, a
Queens resident at the rally.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no choice in the black community except her," Diggs said. "Not
only is Mr. (Rudolph) Giuliani so unpopular, but the issues that she espouses
are clearly those that appeal to the black community."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton will need heavy turnout from neighborhoods like Jamaica - a working
class black enclave with a powerful Democratic organization - if she is to
defeat Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   Without mentioning the mayor by name, Clinton alluded to the criticism that
has flown between the two campaigns this week over issues like campaign
fundraising and posting the ten commandments in public school classrooms.
</P>
<P>
	   "I intend to run a campaign on issues and ideas, not on insults," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   At a Queens senior citizens residence, Clinton proposed a $3,000 tax credit
for families caring for sick or disabled relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   "Many of you know how difficult it is and exhausting to care for a loved one
who is physically or psychologically having difficulty," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   A tax credit, she argued, "will help support the diverse needs that people
have in long-term care." Clinton also said that government should provide more
services and information to such families.
</P>
<P>
	   The seniors cheered her pledges of support for Medicare, Social Security and
cheaper prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am so elated that you are here," one woman gushed. "You have my vote."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was also cheered by party stalwarts at Bronx Democratic
headquarters, where she received a jacket that said "I'm a proud Bronx
Democrat." She told supporters she was proud to be running in New York, "the
place that beckons everyone, including immigrants from Washington, D.C., like
me."
</P>
<P>
	   At the Caridad Restaurant in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan,
Clinton was joined by fashion designer Oscar de la Renta, as well as by
Dominican and other Hispanic leaders.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Leader: Scandals Help Right  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- A major Jewish leader warned Saturday that German disgust with
current political scandals may end up strengthening far-right parties like in
Austria.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I see the danger that in the next elections, (German far-right parties)
will receive more encouragement than they have so far because of the visible
disaffection for politics,'' Paul Spiegel, president of the Central Council of
Jews in Germany, told the Magdeburger Volksstimme newspaper. The council is the
political arm of Germany's Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
	   The interview with Spiegel came as a leaders of the Free Democrats, a small,
market-oriented party, voted Saturday in the state of Hesse to stay in a
coalition with Christian Democratic Governor Roland Koch -- despite his
admission on Tuesday to having lied about the source of party funds.
</P>
<P>
	   Spiegel noted that many Austrians who supported Joerg Haider's right-wing
Freedom Party -- which entered the government in Vienna last week, sparking an
international outcry -- were apparently protest voters angry over allegations of
corruption in the mainstream parties.
</P>
<P>
	   The Christian Democrats previously had high hopes that Koch could help lead
them out of the scandal sparked by former Chancellor Helmut Kohl's revelation in
December that he illegally kept large political donations off the books.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfgang Gerhard, national chairman of the Free Democrats, urged a
withdrawal from the coalition at Saturday's meeting, worried that the taint of
scandal covering the Christian Democrats could rub off on them. But the state
board voted 15-7 to stick with Koch, thus saving his year-old government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe it's a party crisis and not a government crisis,'' state
chairman Ruth Wagner said in explaining the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Leading German intellectuals including Nobel laureate Guenter Grass and
philosopher Juergen Habermas published an open letter Saturday calling for new
elections in Hesse, which includes the financial capital of Frankfurt.

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Ousts Chairman Gargan  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Ross Perot's Reform Party ousted party chairman
Jack Gargan, an ally of dissident Jesse Ventura, during a Saturday showdown that
exploded almost immediately with raw hostility and scuffling. At one point,
local police threatened to shut down the proceedings, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee, by a 109-31 vote, said ousted Gargan on a motion that said
``he has failed to faithfully perform and execute the duties of his office.''
One person abstained.
</P>
<P>
	   The motion said Gargan's failures and violations of the party's constitution
``have resulted in substantial harm to the public image of the party, and in a
breakdown of the proper administration, operation and governance of the party.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
	   Gargan said afterward that ``the cards were stacked'' against him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This was not the Reform Party that I know,'' he said. ``This is not the
party of honesty and integrity. This was a sham.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gargan vowed to fight back at the Las Vegas Reform Party meeting March 18
and 19.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Gargan had cried out ``it's an illegal meeting!'' as the audience
chanted that he be turned ``out, out out!'' from his post.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, a Perot ally who identified herself only as Melanie of San
Diego rushed the front of the room and tried to unplug Gargan's microphone
because he wouldn't call the meeting to order.
</P>
<P>
	   Gargan supporter Sue Harris de Bauche of Virginia slapped and pushed Melanie
to the floor, and two police officers separated the two. One escorted Harris de
Bauche from the room, as it rang with members telling each other to ``shut up''
and begin the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Democracy can be messy, can't it?'' said Donna Donovan, spokeswoman for
the Perot faction.
</P>
<P>
	   That's one way of describing months of infighting so fierce that members of
the party founded by Ross Perot openly speculated about whether it would survive
to participate credibly in this year's presidential race.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the Internet, in court and in the press, the factions have battled over
everything from the location of the party's nominating convention, its
philosophical direction, its procedures and even whether certain national
committee members were qualified to be present on Saturday. For months, a move
has been afoot to oust Gargan, Ventura's hand-picked chairman who took his post
in January.
</P>
<P>
	   Certain that enough votes existed to oust Gargan, Ventura fired a preemptive
strike at the national party Friday by quitting, branding the organization
``dysfunctional'' and urging the Minnesota state party to break away.
</P>
<P>
	   The same day, Ronn Young, the treasurer of the Reform Party and a supporter
of Gargan, filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Western District of
Virginia seeking the party's financial records, which he says were never turned
over to him by his predecessors, who are loyal to Perot.
</P>
<P>
	   At the meeting, Gargan's allies were far outnumbered by Perot's, and both
sides arrived in the conference room at the Nashville Airport Marriott poised
for a squabble. Gargan got a few steps inside the ropes marking the meeting zone
when he was surrounded by Perot loyalists who objected to Gargan's two attorneys
accompanying him.
</P>
<P>
	   Finally taking the podium, Gargan was able to find two areas of common
ground when he asked participants to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance, and
remain standing for a moment of silence in memory of those killed in the Alaska
Airlines crash last week.
</P>
<P>
	   That was the last moment of peaceful assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   From the podium, Gargan began making his case that the meeting was illegally
called because members were given fewer than the required 30 days of notice.
</P>
<P>
	   He was immediately shouted down by Perot's allies.
</P>
<P>
	   From microphones scattered throughout the audience, motions were made to
oust Gargan from chairing the meeting. He refused to leave the podium and
continued trying to make his case.
</P>
<P>
	   One of his supporters, Dale Barlow of Oklahoma, grabbed Gargan's microphone
at one point and hollered: ``I am ashamed of this party!''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Shut up, Dale!'' someone yelled.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, about eight Nashville police officers who had responded to an
anonymous 911 call gathered outside the conference room, according to Kathryn
Seibel of Tennessee, who organized much of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They said they would shut it down if we didn't get it under control,''
Seibel said. ``I said this was a temporary blip.''
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, Gargan agreed to step aside after the members voted 95-14 to install
Tom McLaughlin of Pennsylvania as the new chairman of the meeting. Gargan agreed
to sit at the edge of the stage while McLaughlin and party secretary Jim Mangia
reviewed the challenges to delegates representing 11 states.
</P>
<P>
	   Like most of Perot's supporters, Seibel vowed to heal the party. But she
recalled wistfully the previous night, when she had dinner with other members
and discussed public policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You would have been impressed; we were talking about light rail, campaign

<HEADLINE> First Lady Promotes Tax Plan in NYC  </HEADLINE>
   By BETH GARDINER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton promoted a tax credit for families
caring for sick or disabled relatives Saturday at campaign stops directed toward
minority and elderly voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Her likely opponent in the U.S. Senate race, Republican Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, meanwhile took a shot at Clinton's husband, saying the president was
``turning his back on the suffering of all New Yorkers'' who are facing huge
increases in the cost of heating oil.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani called for the release of a portion of the country's oil reserve to
offset the price hikes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What I've learned is that the only way to reach the White House is to make
it a political issue,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hillary Rodham Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said when asked about
the comments: ``I'm not going to respond to Mayor Giuliani.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton met Saturday with black Democrats and senior citizens in Queens,
where she proposed a $3,000 tax credit for families caring for sick or disabled
relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Many of you know how difficult it is and exhausting to care for a loved
one who is physically or psychologically having difficulty,'' she told those
gathered at a senior citizens residence.
</P>
<P>
	   She later stopped at a Hispanic eatery in Manhattan, spoke at a rally in the
Bronx and planned to attend a dinner in Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no choice in the black community except her,'' Rep. Gregory
Meeks, D-N.Y., said at the Queens rally. ``Not only is Mr. Giuliani so
unpopular, but the issues that she espouses are clearly those that appeal to the
black community.''
</P>
<P>
	   In response to Giuliani's criticism about oil prices, White House deputy
press secretary Jim Kennedy said selling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to
lower oil prices was not allowed by law.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president has taken strong measures to help struggling families pay
their energy bills,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., contradicted Kennedy, saying sale of the
reserve was legal in an emergency. The Clinton administration has not said the
current needs and oil prices meet that standard.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, which has the nation's highest home heating oil costs, the
price per gallon has shot up from 72 cents to $2.50 since the first of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani released a three-paragraph letter that he sent to the White House
urging the sale of a portion of the reserve to drive the prices down.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can use all the support we can get,'' said Schumer, who first called
for sales from the reserve in September.
</P>
<P>
	   The prices began soaring after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries rolled back production by 4.3 million barrels a day last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal government earlier this week announced $130 million in
assistance to help the indigent cover their heating costs. But Energy Secretary
William Richardson said there were no plans to sell the reserve.

<HEADLINE> Witness: 24 Die in Somali Fighting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) -- At least 24 people were killed and another 45
wounded in interclan fighting in southwestern Somalia, a witness said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Fighting in Dhobley, 340 miles southwest of the capital, Mogadishu, erupted
during the night when 150 subclan fighters attacked the town, the witness said.
The witness, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the casualties included
noncombatants and fighters from both sides of the Ogaden clan.
</P>
<P>
	   The fighting raged until early morning, halting all activities in the border
town, said the witness, who spoke over high-frequency radio.
</P>
<P>
	   Somalia has had no central government since late dictator Mohammed Siad
Barre was ousted by a coalition of rebels. After Siad Barre's ouster, the rebels
turned against each other and the country disintegrated into fiefdoms controlled
by clan militias.
</P>
<P>
	   The witness said the latest fighting is a continuation of an unspecified
Ogaden clan feud that had already killed 21 people. Reasons for the recent
hostilities remain unclear, but a Dhobley businessman who spoke on condition of
anonymity said Saturday it appeared to involve control of a smuggling route to
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenya closed its border with this east African nation late last year, citing
smuggling and security concerns. Dhobley remains a smuggling hub.

<HEADLINE> French Woman Test Pilot Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Jacqueline Auriol, France's first woman test pilot who set
several world aviation speed records in the 1950s and 1960s, has died, her
family said Saturday. She was 82.
</P>
<P>
	   Auriol, the daughter-in-law of former French President Vincent Auriol, set a
world speed record for women aviators in 1951. On three occasions she was
awarded the Harmon International Trophy by an American president in recognition
of aviation exploits.
</P>
<P>
	   President Jacques Chirac said in a statement Saturday that Auriol was ``a
great woman who for decades was the incarnation of courage and modernity for the
French people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Auriol was born in November 1917 in the western Vendee region. She is
survived by her two children. There were no immediate details of funeral
arrangements. The cause of her death was not known.

<HEADLINE> Report: Deutch Aide Got Bank Job  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A CIA official who monitored the investigation into whether
former agency head John Deutch mishandled classified information later went to
work for a bank where Deutch was a director, The New York Times reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch resigned as CIA director in December 1996 and was elected to the
board of Citibank. That same month, CIA officials found evidence he had placed
classified information on unsecure computers at his home, although they
reportedly didn't notify the Justice Department of potential wrongdoing for more
than a year.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation monitor was Nora Slatkin, the CIA's executive director.
Deutch recommended her for a management job at Citibank even as she was still
monitoring the case, the Times reported, citing CIA records and interviews with
officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Slatkin notified the agency in June 1997 that she was considering a
job with Citibank and would withdraw from consideration of anything involving
the bank, within a month she reviewed an internal report of findings in the
Deutch investigation, the Times reported, citing a classified agency report.
</P>
<P>
	   Slatkin resigned from the CIA in September 1997 and joined Citibank as a
vice president the next month, the Times reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The CIA's inspector general has found that Slatkin's actions delayed ``a
prompt and thorough investigation'' of the Deutch case, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Times reported there was no evidence that Slatkin's hiring at Citibank
was a quid pro quo for actions she took in the Deutch investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Slatkin said she had excused herself from the investigation and only helped
keep information flowing.
</P>
<P>
	   The Times quoted an unidentified Citibank spokesman as saying Deutch
referred Slatkin to the bank as she was considering where to move after leaving
the agency.
</P>
<P>
	   CIA Director George J. Tenet would not comment on the Citibank matter. The
Justice Department decided last spring not to prosecute Deutch.

<HEADLINE> Balkan Leaders Want More Democracy  </HEADLINE>
   By ALISON MUTLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Leaders of seven Balkan nations pledged Saturday
to work together to bring more democracy and promote investment in the turbulent
region.
</P>
<P>
	   The third high-level meeting of the South-East European Cooperation Process
also brought together traditional foes Turkey and Greece, whose leaders held
their own bilateral talks about Turkey's membership in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
	   After a 20-minute meeting with the Turkish prime minister, Greek Premier
Costas Simitis said recent meetings between Turkey and Greece had been ``very
positive.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We said that we must continue in this direction,'' Costas told Greece's
state-run NET television. ``We have also to look at other common problems
(since) Turkey is a candidate for the European Union.''
</P>
<P>
	   Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said the two countries had ``discussed
common problems regarding the European Union.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later, the leaders signed a 21-point ``charter of good neighborly relations,
stability, security and cooperation in southeast Europe.''
</P>
<P>
	   Participants of the meeting included Albania, Bulgaria, Bosnia-Herzegovina,
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Greece, Romania and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
	   Yugoslavia was not invited. However, Romanian President Emil Constantinescu
said he hoped Yugoslavia would take its rightful place at a future meeting when
it ``has democratically elected leaders.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a final statement, the countries urged ``the citizens of former
Yugoslavia to contribute to the democratization (of the country),'' adding that
Yugoslavia's neighbors would seek to promote humanitarian aid to the stricken
country.
</P>
<P>
	   Yugoslavia's place was marked with an empty chair and a flag, showing the
other members hope to eventually include the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Indicating at their own financial losses caused by NATO's bombardment of
Yugoslavia and the conflict in Kosovo, the countries said they hoped solutions
would be found to compensate for ``direct and indirect losses following the
Kosovo conflict.'' The statement did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   Bodo Hombach, special coordinator for the international Pact for Stability
in South-Eastern Europe also attended the one-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders also discussed the traffic blockage on the Danube River following
the collapse of Yugoslav bridges during last year's NATO bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   On another related problem, Simitis told reporters he hoped the issue of the
name of Macedonia, officially the ``Former Slav Republic of Macedonia,'' would
soon be resolved.
</P>
<P>
	   Greece considers the name Macedonia, which also refers to the region in
northern Greece, to be inalienably Greek.

<HEADLINE> Screamin' Jay Hawkins Dies at Age 70  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Screamin' Jay Hawkins, the larger-than-life American blues
singer and pianist who shocked the music world at the dawn of rock with his
crazed shrieking and bizarre stage antics, died Saturday. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
	   The musician, whose real name was Jalacy Hawkins, died at the Ambroise Pave
clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a suburb west of Paris. He had suffered multiple
organ failure following emergency surgery to treat an aneurysm, a doctor who
requested anonymity told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Hawkins, from Cleveland, was best known for his song ``I Put a Spell On
You,'' which he recorded on the Okeh label in 1956 and which helped win him cult
status in the United States, Europe and Japan. He had originally planned the
tune as a ballad, but after a night of heavy drinking he took another crack --
screaming, yelling and groaning -- and never looked back.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of his groans had to be edited out so that ``I Put a Spell On You''
could be played on the radio. Hawkins once said the song, written to woo back a
girlfriend, was at first banned by some radio stations because it supposedly
sounded cannibalistic.
</P>
<P>
	   Hawkins went on to use the same demented style again and again. An
outrageous performer, he used bizarre stage props, often emerging out of coffins
during shows. He would wield rubber snakes and fake tarantulas and wear a boar's
tooth around his neck or a bone clipped to his nose.
</P>
<P>
	   He frequently seriously burned himself while using exploding fuse boxes. His
constant on-stage companion: a cigarette-smoking, flaming skull named Henry.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about the unique style of his songs, he once said: ``I don't sing
them. I destroy them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Oddly, his passion was opera, which he said inspired his stage persona.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I watched enough Mario Lanza,'' he said of the famed opera singer. ``I
took that and sax and combined it into screamin' instead of singin'.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hawkins got his first break in 1951 as a pianist-valet to veteran jazz
guitarist Tiny Grimes. His recording debut was 1952's ``Why Did You Waste My
Time,'' backed by Grimes and his Rockin' Highlanders.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1960s, Hawkins recorded the hits ``Alligator Wine,'' ``Feast of the
Mau Mau'' and ``I Hear Voices.'' In more recent years, he appeared in the films
``Mystery Train'' and ``A Rage in Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hawkins had lived near Paris for several years. There were no immediate
details of funeral arrangements, but Hawkins once said he wanted to be cremated.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wrote in my will to cremate me ... fly over the ocean and scatter the
dust so I can be little particles in everybody's eyes -- drive everybody crazy
the rest of their lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Information on family members and funeral arrangements was not immediately
available.

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Ousts Chairman Gargan  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Ross Perot's Reform Party ousted party chairman
Jack Gargan, an ally of dissident Jesse Ventura, during a Saturday showdown that
exploded almost immediately with raw hostility and scuffling. At one point,
local police threatened to shut down the proceedings, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee, by a 109-31 vote, ousted Gargan on a motion that said ``he
has failed to faithfully perform and execute the duties of his office.'' One
person abstained.
</P>
<P>
	   The motion said Gargan's failures and violations of the party's constitution
``have resulted in substantial harm to the public image of the party, and in a
breakdown of the proper administration, operation and governance of the party.''
</P>
<P>
	   The name of Ventura, governor of Minnesota, did not come up during the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the action in Nashville, Ventura said Saturday: ``It saddens me, but it
doesn't surprise me. That's why I made the decision I made yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ventura noted that Gargan had won the chairmanship ``fair and square'' in
July at the national convention in Dearborn, Mich. Gargan said after the meeting
in Nashville that ``the cards were stacked'' against him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This was not the Reform Party that I know,'' he said. ``This is not the
party of honesty and integrity. This was a sham.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gargan vowed to fight back. Earlier Gargan had cried out ``it's an illegal
meeting!'' as the audience chanted that he be turned ``out, out out!'' from his
post.

Virginia seeking the party's financial records, which he says were never turned

</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, Minnesota Reform Party leaders approved a special state
convention March 4 to consider the split from the national party.
</P>

the recent assassination of Defense Minister Pavle Bulatovic and said they
should be ``liquidated.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bulatovic's death is still being investigated, but Seselj has accused the

<HEADLINE> Nine Indicted in La. Jail Takeover  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN CLENDENNING Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Eight Cubans and a Bahamian accused of holding hostages
during the six-day takeover of the St. Martin Parish Jail in December have been
indicted on state kidnapping charges that carry mandatory life sentences.
</P>
<P>
	   Only three will immediately face the charges because six of the Cubans were
sent back to their home country after the standoff.
</P>
<P>
	   The indictment on Friday will ensure that the six could be arrested and
tried if they ever re-enter this country, District Attorney Phil Haney said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My experience tells me we have deported people outside of the U.S. for
other crimes and we've had them show back up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The prison warden, three deputies and several female inmates were taken
hostage Dec. 13 at the jail in St. Martinville, about 100 miles west of New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
	   The hostage-takers, most of them being detained for the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said they rebelled because they had served their prison
sentences but were being held indefinitely awaiting deportation. For Cubans, the
wait can take years because the United States does not have a deportation
agreement with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The six who were returned to Cuba were jailed after their arrival. Cuban
officials said they planned to investigate the case.
</P>
<P>
	   One Cuban, Roberto Villar, was left behind. Federal officials say they took
him off the plane bound for Cuba because of an allegation that he had raped a
female inmate during the standoff. But authorities in St. Martin Parish say they
never made such an allegation.
</P>
<P>
	   A second Cuban named in the indictment, Miguel Canton, also remained in this
country. Haney said Canton was involved in the takeover for several days.

<HEADLINE> After fatal dorm fire at Seton Hall, false alarms at Rutgers drop  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - In the three weeks since Seton Hall University's
fatal dorm fire, there have been no false alarms reported at Rutgers
University's 33 residence halls.
<P>
	   Last year, students at the school's main campus in New Brunswick left their
dorms and classrooms 107 times because of false alarms, school officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Unfortunately, it took the tragedy at Seton Hall to bring this (problem) to
the forefront," Joe Zuccarello, Rutgers' chief of emergency services told The
Star-Ledger of Newark in Saturday's editions.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rutgers Board of Governors, which oversees the nearly 50,000-student
university, questioned Zuccarello on Friday about prank alarms, sprinkler
systems and fire safety during its monthly meeting in Camden.
</P>
<P>
	   Zuccarello said the lack of false alarms showed that the students had
learned from the Seton Hall fire.
</P>
<P>
	   At Seton Hall, where three students perished and 58 others were injured in
the Jan. 19 fire at Boland Hall, there also have been no false alarms since the
fire, according to spokeswoman Lisa Grider.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the 600 students in Boland Hall said they were reluctant to leave
after the alarm signaled the early morning fire because students had pulled
false alarms in the past.
</P>
<P>
	   The day after the fire, about 200 students were evacuated from nearby Xavier
Hall after an alarm had been pulled by a student who reported smelling fumes.
There were no problems in the building.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly all of New Jersey's 24 residential colleges have at least one dorm
without sprinklers. The state legislature is debating a bill that would require
all of the state's colleges to have sprinklers in its dormitories.
</P>
<P>
	   Rutgers is already planning for the bill's passage, and hopes to get a jump
on what could be a run on sprinkler equipment and installers.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we're doing it, everyone else is going to have to do it at the same
time," Zuccarello said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rutgers estimates the cost of installing sprinklers, not including the
possible need for a new water main, at $35 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Of Rutgers' 173 residential halls at its New Brunswick, Camden and Newark
campuses, only 27 have full sprinkler systems with sprinkler heads in every
room. Dorms without sprinklers are on the school's New Brunswick and Piscataway
campuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Seton Hall officials announced the installation of sprinkler
systems in two dormitories that lacked them, including Boland Hall where the
fire occurred. The school's other four dormitories have sprinkler systems, which
will be upgraded and expanded, although the cost has not been estimated.

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Gore Vie for Calif. Votes  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- With the room stacked against him and polls giving
his opponent nearly a 4-1 lead in the state, Bill Bradley argued passionately
for converts Saturday at the California Democratic convention. Vice President Al
Gore warned Bradley is not a ``real Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
	   In back-to-back speeches as different as night and day, Gore debuted his
most ruthless offensive yet in this increasingly bitter contest. Bradley offered
a romantic vision of the party that hopes to hold the White House, highlighting
goals of universal health care and elimination of child poverty.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have in our best moments always been the party of big ideas and big
ideals,'' Bradley said. And between him and Gore, ``There is a difference in
boldness.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore had only to clasp raised fists with Gov. Gray Davis in a victory salute
to demonstrate his muscle in California.
</P>
<P>
	   Relying on note cards, Gore said Bradley has ``attacked'' and ``demeaned''
the Democratic Party by faulting the Clinton-Gore administration's lack of
progress on health care, gun control and child poverty.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore accused Bradley, who has hammered the vice president for past pro-gun
and anti-abortion views, of taking his cue from the Republican National
Committee. ``Real Democrats don't aid and abet the Republicans,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator Bradley claims he's doing us a service because he doesn't want to
see Democrats bashed in the fall. His proposed solution is to bash Democrats in
the spring,'' Gore added to cheers from a crowd that nearly doubled in the time
between Bradley's speech and Gore's.
</P>
<P>
	   Antioch nurse Martha Henry said she was converted on the spot by Bradley,
``because I believed everything he said.'' But she doubted he had time to
overcome Gore before the March 7 jackpot primary will decide 367 of the 2,170
delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   ``From the crowd in here, I wouldn't think he could, but I hope so,'' said
Henry.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore supporter Roger Henry, a party central committee member from Contra
Costa county, said he understood his wife's instant support for Bradley and his
vision.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm a traditionalist but I want to win. You've got to have the office to
have the power,'' said Mr. Henry.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bradley's vision is what Bill Clinton's was in 1992 and we couldn't get it
done. Gore's vision -- what Bradley calls 'clipping around the edges' -- is
doable.''
</P>
<P>
	   The party favorite, Gore spoke inside the San Jose convention center after a
lineup of officials -- the governor, party chairman Art Torres, Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, Sen. Barbara Boxer -- promoted the vice president's ascension.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nominate Al Gore!'' Boxer ordered some 3,000 convention-goers who are
reliable primary voters.
</P>
<P>
	   After Bradley vacated the podium, Torres called out: ``Godspeed, Senator
Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
	   A woman at the foot of the stage hoisted a large, neon-orange heart that
read: ``Bill Bradley is change.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore has backing here from all but a handful of elected officials and Davis
has pledged the work of his ``entire operation'' in Gore's service. To try and
counter Gore's institutional advantage, Bradley has placed markers on as much as
$3 million worth of TV advertising time for the final two weeks of the
California race, said a knowledgeable ad industry expert.
</P>
<P>
	   On his way to the meeting, Bradley tried to make his own show of muscle,
leading a march of some 500 supporters through downtown San Jose to the
convention center. The party barred entrance to most of them, allowing Bradley
just 200 or so guest passes.
</P>
<P>
	   The former senator from New Jersey spoke of dreams, saying his goals are
universal health care, the elimination of child poverty, registration of all
handguns, deeper racial understanding, and ``a qualified teacher in every
classroom in every school.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe to the bottom core of my being that the Democratic Party can be
the agent for that kind of dream, for that kind of accomplishment, as long as we
do one thing: we must not settle,'' Bradley said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton campaigns in NYC; Giuliani calls for oil relief  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton promoted a tax credit for
families caring for sick or disabled relatives Saturday at campaign stops
directed toward minority and elderly voters.
<P>
	   Her likely opponent in the U.S. Senate race, Republican Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, meanwhile took a shot at Clinton's husband, saying the president was
"turning his back on the suffering of all New Yorkers" who are facing huge
increases in the cost of heating oil.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani called for the release of a portion of the country's oil reserve to
offset the price hikes.
</P>
<P>
	   "What I've learned is that the only way to reach the White House is to make
it a political issue," the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hillary Rodham Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said when asked about
the comments: "I'm not going to respond to Mayor Giuliani."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton met Saturday with black Democrats and senior citizens in Queens,
where she proposed a $3,000 tax credit for families caring for sick or disabled
relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   "Many of you know how difficult it is and exhausting to care for a loved one
who is physically or psychologically having difficulty," she told those gathered
at a senior citizens residence.
</P>
<P>
	   She also stopped at a Queens college and a Hispanic eatery in Manhattan,
spoke at a rally in the Bronx and planned to attend a dinner in Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no choice in the black community except her," said Jeff Diggs, a
Queens resident who attended the rally at York College in Queens. "Not only is
Mr. Giuliani so unpopular, but the issues that she espouses are clearly those
that appeal to the black community."
</P>
<P>
	   In response to Giuliani's criticism about oil prices, White House deputy
press secretary Jim Kennedy said selling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to
lower oil prices was not allowed by law.
</P>
<P>
	   "The president has taken strong measures to help struggling families pay
their energy bills," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., contradicted Kennedy, saying sale of the
reserve was legal in an emergency. The Clinton administration has not said the
current needs and oil prices meet that standard.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, which has the nation's highest home heating oil costs, the
price per gallon has shot up from 72 cents to $2.50 since the first of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani released a three-paragraph letter that he sent to the White House
urging the sale of a portion of the reserve to drive the prices down.
</P>
<P>
	   "We can use all the support we can get," said Schumer, who first called for
sales from the reserve in September.
</P>
<P>
	   The prices began soaring after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries rolled back production by 4.3 million barrels a day last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal government earlier this week announced $130 million in
assistance to help the indigent cover their heating costs. But Energy Secretary
William Richardson said there were no plans to sell the reserve.

<HEADLINE> Report: Serb Socialists Fight On  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- President Slobodan Milosevic's ruling Socialist
party is planning aggressive campaigns to win back control of Serbia's
opposition-governed municipalities, an independent Belgrade daily reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling party and its ultranationalist and neocommunist allies want to
fend off increasingly popular democratic opposition parties and take back
localities they lost in 1996 elections, the newspaper Glas said. It quoted a
Socialist official whom it did not identify.
</P>
<P>
	   Four years ago, allied opposition parties won local elections in Serbia's
main urban areas. Milosevic tried to annul the results, but the move triggered
massive protests and he eventually acknowledged defeat.
</P>
<P>
	   Dates for new municipal elections have not yet been set. They could take
place as early as May, Glas quoted the official as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   Regardless, a substantial change of authority in Serbia depends on crucial
parliamentary elections, not due before 2001. Confident of defeating Milosevic,
the opposition has demanded early parliamentary balloting.

<HEADLINE> Midwest Express Resumes Service  </HEADLINE>
    By JENNY PRICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Midwest Express resumed its regular flight schedule
Saturday after averting a pilots strike over wages and retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement reached early Saturday is the first labor contract between the
company and the Air Line Pilots Association.
</P>
<P>
	   "They had the tool, they had the weapon if they felt they needed to use it,"
said Hal Myers, a spokesman for the pilots union. "The company understood that
and they found the agreeable middle ground that would be beneficial for both of
the parties."
</P>
<P>
	   Pilots are expected to vote on the agreement within a week, Myers said. A
majority of the airline's 330 pilots must approve the contract.
</P>
<P>
	   Strike committee chairman Karl Petersen said the deal gives pilots higher
pay and retirement benefits "that will protect and enhance the careers of our
pilots." No other details were released.
</P>
<P>
	   The 16-year-old airline employs nearly 2,800 people, 80 percent of them in
Milwaukee. Midwest Express averages 130 daily flights to 31 cities.
</P>
<P>
	   "While the negotiation process is often long and tedious, both the company
and the pilot group rose to the occasion to come to an agreement that is fair to
all," said Timothy Hoeksema, chief executive officer of Midwest Express.
</P>
<P>
	   Airline officials canceled 15 flights scheduled for late Friday and early
Saturday in preparation for a potential strike. Service resumed by sunrise and
flights were running on schedule, airline spokeswoman Lisa Bailey said Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Report: Israel Heightens Security  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE COPANS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel put security forces on alert around the country
Saturday due to intelligence reports that terror attacks could be carried out in
crowded places, Israel radio reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Security forces increased their numbers in many cities in reaction to the
warning, which was not specific about a time or place, the radio said. Police
officials did not immediately return phone calls to comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli security officials arrested on Saturday the head of the Islamic
movement at a university in the West Bank city of Ramallah and three other
Palestinians near Bethlehem, Israel army radio reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The army spokesman's office refused to comment on the army radio report.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear if the attack warning was related to a recent stalemate in
peace talks with the Palestinians over a disagreement regarding Israeli
withdrawals from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian International Cooperation Minister Nabil Shaath said Friday that
security coordination was ongoing with Israel despite the crisis in the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian police have arrested eight Palestinians since Thursday for
alleged involvement in a car explosion near the West Bank city of Nablus that
Palestinian security officials said was an attempt to carry out a terror attack
in Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   One Palestinian was killed and another injured in the explosion, the
Palestinian security officials said on condition of anonymity. Three of the
suspects were later released.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli security officials said on condition of anonymity that the warning
of possible attacks came in light of information the Palestinians had extracted
from the suspects in the car explosion.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of those Palestinians arrested were allegedly members of the Islamic
resistance group Hamas, which has carried out several deadly attacks in Israel
but has not succeeded in carrying out any major attacks in several months.

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Ousts Chairman Gargan  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Ross Perot's Reform Party ousted party chairman
Jack Gargan, an ally of dissident Jesse Ventura, during a Saturday showdown that
exploded almost immediately with raw hostility and scuffling. At one point,
local police threatened to shut down the proceedings, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee, by a 109-31 vote, ousted Gargan on a motion that said ``he
has failed to faithfully perform and execute the duties of his office.'' One
person abstained.
</P>
<P>
	   The motion said Gargan's failures and violations of the party's constitution
``have resulted in substantial harm to the public image of the party, and in a
breakdown of the proper administration, operation and governance of the party.''
</P>
<P>
	   The name of Ventura, the governor of Minnesota who quit the national party
Friday, did not come up during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the action in Nashville, Ventura said Saturday: ``It saddens me, but it
doesn't surprise me. That's why I made the decision I made yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ventura noted that Gargan had won the chairmanship ``fair and square'' in
July at the national convention in Dearborn, Mich. Gargan said after the meeting
in Nashville that ``the cards were stacked'' against him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This was not the Reform Party that I know,'' he said. ``This is not the
party of honesty and integrity. This was a sham.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gargan vowed to fight back. Earlier Gargan had cried out ``it's an illegal
meeting!'' as the audience chanted that he be turned ``out, out out!'' from his
post.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, a Perot ally who identified herself only as Melanie of San
Diego rushed the front of the room and tried to unplug Gargan's microphone
because he wouldn't call the meeting to order.
</P>
<P>
	   Gargan supporter Sue Harris de Bauche of Virginia slapped and pushed Melanie
to the floor, and two police officers separated the two. One escorted Harris de
Bauche from the room, as it rang with members telling each other to ``shut up''
and begin the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Democracy can be messy, can't it?'' said Donna Donovan, spokeswoman for
the Perot faction.
</P>
<P>
	   That's one way of describing months of infighting so fierce that members of
the party founded by Ross Perot openly speculated about whether it would survive
to participate credibly in this year's presidential race.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the Internet, in court and in the press, the factions have battled over
everything from the location of the party's nominating convention, its
philosophical direction, its procedures and even whether certain national
committee members were qualified to be present on Saturday. For months, a move
has been afoot to oust Gargan, Ventura's hand-picked chairman who took his post
in January.
</P>
<P>
	   Certain that enough votes existed to oust Gargan, Ventura fired a preemptive
strike at the national party Friday by quitting, branding the organization
``dysfunctional'' and urging the Minnesota state party to break away.
</P>
<P>
	   The same day, Ronn Young, the treasurer of the Reform Party and a supporter
of Gargan, filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Western District of
Virginia seeking the party's financial records, which he says were never turned
over to him by his predecessors, who are loyal to Perot.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, Minnesota Reform Party leaders approved a special state
convention March 4 to consider the split from the national party.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Nashville meeting, Gargan's allies were far outnumbered by Perot's,
and both sides arrived in the conference room at the Nashville Airport Marriott
poised for a squabble. Gargan got a few steps inside the ropes marking the
meeting zone when he was surrounded by Perot loyalists who objected to Gargan's
two attorneys accompanying him.
</P>
<P>
	   Finally taking the podium, Gargan was able to find two areas of common
ground when he asked participants to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance, and
remain standing for a moment of silence in memory of those killed in the Alaska
Airlines crash last week.
</P>
<P>
	   That was the last moment of peaceful assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   From the podium, Gargan began making his case that the meeting was illegally
called because members were given fewer than the required 30 days of notice. He
was immediately shouted down by Perot's allies.
</P>
<P>
	   From microphones scattered throughout the audience, motions were made to
oust Gargan from chairing the meeting. He refused to leave the podium and
continued trying to make his case.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, about eight Nashville police officers who had responded to an
anonymous 911 call gathered outside the conference room, according to Kathryn
Seibel of Tennessee, who organized much of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They said they would shut it down if we didn't get it under control,''
Seibel said. ``I said this was a temporary blip.''
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, Gargan agreed to step aside after the members voted 95-14 to install
Tom McLaughlin of Pennsylvania as the new chairman of the meeting. Gargan agreed
to sit at the edge of the stage while McLaughlin and party secretary Jim Mangia
reviewed the challenges to delegates representing 11 states.
</P>
<P>
	   Like most of Perot's supporters, Seibel vowed to heal the party. But she
recalled wistfully the previous night, when she had dinner with other members
and discussed public policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You would have been impressed; we were talking about light rail, campaign
finance reform,'' Seibel said.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked how she felt about the developments, she said, ``I'm mortified.''

<HEADLINE> 51 Mexican Students To Be Tried  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A Mexico City judge ordered 51 students held for trial
without bail Saturday, after they led a bitter university strike that canceled
classes for more than nine months.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the 745 strikers arrested Feb. 6 have been released from jails and
juvenile detention centers ahead of Monday's reopening of the National
Autonomous University of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   The strike broke out April 20 over a plan to increase tuition to the
university, Latin America's largest.
</P>
<P>
	   Many members of the 260,000-student university community have called for
dropping the charges against the students, who were arrested after federal
police marched onto campus and broke up the strike.
</P>
<P>
	   However, university officials and police apparently wanted the hard-line
leftist leaders of the strike to remain in jail, at least until classes resumed,
to avoid possible demonstrations at Monday's reopening.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge ruled that 49 students accused of illegally occupying the
university's Mexico City campus be denied bail on the grounds they pose a danger
to society, though under the charges -- a lesser form of robbery -- they would
be eligible for bail. Defense attorneys have five days to appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   Top strike leaders Alejandro Echeverria and Albert Perched -- know by their
nicknames as ``El Moss'' and ``The Devil'' -- were ordered held until trial on
more serious charges of causing injuries and robbery. By law they are not
eligible for bail, the government news agency Notimex reported.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, 75 strikers under the age of 18 were released from a juvenile
detention center; only two, suspected of more serious crimes, were still being
held in that center.
</P>
<P>
	   University Rector Juan Ramon de la Fuente urged prosecutors to drop charges
against most of the strikers, according to written testimony submitted through
his lawyers at a hearing Saturday for students at a Mexico City prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The strike started as a protest of the university's plans to increase
tuition from a token few cents a year to the equivalent of $140. Administrators
backed off the fee increase, but strikers' demands grew to include sweeping
policy changes and a call for greater student control.
</P>
<P>
	   In a Saturday radio speech, President Ernesto Zedillo pledged to support the
nation's public universities with government funds, and said ``they can
administer themselves under the principles of freedom of instruction, research
and discussion of ideas.''

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rico Welcomes Ricky Martin  </HEADLINE>
    By MANUEL ERNESTO RIVERA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Thousands of screaming, flag-waving fans are
giving favorite son Ricky Martin a hero's welcome in his native Puerto Rico,
packing a stadium for the pop star's first concerts here since he conquered the
English-language music charts.
</P>
<P>
	   Fans crowded into the Hiram Bithorn Stadium Friday night for the first of
the three shows in San Juan. The run which will wrap up on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin had not performed in Puerto Rico for two years, but many on this
Caribbean island of 3.8 million people are proud of his international success.
At Friday's concert, Martin returned the sentiment.
</P>
<P>
	   "This flag is all over the world. That's Puerto Ricans -- proud of who we
are," Martin told the crowd, prompting deafening applause.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin also won the crowd's approval by voicing his opposition to the U.S.
Navy's bombing exercises on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques. The Puerto Rican
government has agreed to allow limited exercises on Vieques for at least three
more years, but many on the island are opposed to the Navy's presence.
</P>
<P>
	   "Not one bullet more, please," Martin yelled to the cheering crowd while
waving the Puerto Rican flag. "Peace for Vieques!"
</P>
<P>
	   Politics aside, many of Martin's fans were swooning over the ex-Menudo
member's good looks and swinging hips. Keila Rodriguez, 15, said before the
concert began that she was "crazy and anxious" to see Martin "moving his hips."
</P>
<P>
	   "Martin was beautiful!" said Celian Gonzalez, 27.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin kicked off the concert with his huge hit "Livin' La Vida Loca" and
obliged fans' cravings for his latest radio favorite, "Shake Your Bon." He
wrapped up with "The Cup of Life," the song he performed at last year's Grammy
awards.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin just wrapped up a 28-city tour of the United States.

    ANTIGUA, Guatemala (AP) -- Harrison Ford traipsed through the Guatemalan
rainforest Saturday, not in search of the lost treasures he sought in the
"Indian Jones" movies, but to see some of the jungle he has crusaded to
preserve.

	   "He didn't come as an actor but as a conservationist worried about how to
resolve the world's environmental problem," said Harolod Castro, a spokesman for

Lagoon National Park.
</P>
<P>
	   As Ford, 58, walked through foliage that could have served as a backdrop to
one of his adventure films, glaring signs of illegal poaching and slash and burn
campaigns were also present.
</P>
<P>
	   He is an avid environmentalist who has donated millions to wildlife
conservation projects in 30 countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford was joined by hundreds of environmental leaders who attended a series
of lectures on the illegal invasion of hunters and housing developers into
Guatemala's protected natural parks, which were organized by the International
Conservation Congress.

Romania, where a dam at the Baia Mare gold mine overflowed Jan. 30 and caused
cyanide to pour into streams. From there, the polluted water flowed west into
the Tisa River in neighboring Hungary and then on into Yugoslavia. Eighty
percent of the fish in the Tisa have died since the contaminant entered the
country two days ago, said Mayor Atila Juhas of the northern town Senta.

<HEADLINE> McCain Revs Up Campaign in S.C.  </HEADLINE>
   By LEIGH STROPE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DARLINGTON, S.C. (AP) -- John McCain hit 100 mph in a spin around
Darlington's famed speedway Saturday and George W. Bush told people in Columbia
he's ``a tough competitor'' who doesn't like losing.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain kept his campaign in high gear with several town meetings and other
stops the rest of the weekend. Bush made a couple of campaign stops in the
state, before heading back to Austin to spend some time with family, returning
to the campaign trail on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   As Bush was telling an audience at a Columbia restaurant that ``my faith
allowed me to handle a short-term adversity,'' McCain was hopping behind the
wheel of a blue Pontiac Grand Prix NASCAR's Darlington Raceway for a few turns
around the track Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The most important news of the day is I went over 100 miles an hour,''
McCain said. ``I hope I do a better job driving this car than I did on my last
mission.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was a Vietnam POW after his plane was shot down over Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
	   The candidate jumped in the car wearing a suit and tie -- but not a helmet
-- and had his wife Cindy in the passenger seat. He gave a thumbs-up to track
officials and reporters before flooring the gas pedal, kicking up dust in his
wake. He took two laps around the track, stopping once for photographers, and
then emerged from the car with a huge grin.
</P>
<P>
	   The Darlington track has a rich tradition in South Carolina politics. Bob
Dole in 1995 explored the early stages of his presidential bid here and other
candidates have made the mandatory campaign stop at Darlington. The track is in
the heart of tobacco country, where McCain's sponsorship of failed legislation
to raise taxes on tobacco has been a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier the Arizona senator walked through a neighborhood in nearby
Florence, knocking on doors and asking for votes. He surprised Steve Coker, who
answered his door with his children peering from behind him, hiding from the
television cameras.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He'll let all his work show,'' Coker said of McCain. ``We know all about
the Keating Five, we know he's divorced, we're not guessing about his drug
use.''
</P>
<P>
	   Both campaigns on Saturday were still preoccupied with campaign tactics,
trading attacks on everything from push polling to rude telephone calls to
fund-raising. Bush told reporters Saturday that his campaign has hearing from
supporters that they're getting calls from someone claiming to be with the Bush
campaign, who starts ``trashmouthing'' the person answering the phone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I warn the people of South Carolina, Republicans, if you get a phone call
from some voice purporting to be me that is rude, just ignore it,'' Bush said.
``I can assure you our people are not calling to make it hard for me to win the
election.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush did not blame the calls on McCain. Earlier in the week, McCain demanded
that the Bush campaign stop calling voters and misleading them about his record
after a woman complained her 14-year-old son received such a call. The woman
didn't know if the Bush campaign had made the call.
</P>
<P>
	   A Newsweek poll out Saturday showed the race was a dead heat, with Bush
doing better among Republicans and McCain better among independents.
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire, McCain rode his strong support from both groups to an
18-point victory. Bush said Saturday that his faith sustained him after his loss
there. But he told the crowd of about 100 at Seawell's Restaurant that he's wary
of people in public office who say: ``Vote for me, I'm more religious than my
neighbor.'''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Faith, to me, is strength. It puts life in perspective. I recognize that
I'm a humble sinner and I've sought redemption, and I recognize that I'm no
better than anybody else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   After his visit to the capital city of Columbia, Bush traveled to Orangeburg
for a speech and question-and-answer session.

spend the rest of the week in South Carolina after his return on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush campaign was also looking ahead to future primaries. In California,
Bush is launching his ad campaign with the positive ``reformer with results''
spot, a seven-figure buy running for the next couple weeks in large media
markets such as Los Angeles and in heavily Republican areas, including
Bakersfield and San Diego. The McCain campaign has said it will spend less than
the $12.5 million allowed by state law and expects to be outspent 2-to-1 by
Bush.

<HEADLINE> Congolese Rebels Refuse Archbishop  </HEADLINE>
   By HRVOJE HRANJSKI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- Raising tensions with the Roman Catholic church,
rebels in eastern Congo accused Archbishop Emmanuel Kataliko of collaborating
with Congo's president and refused to let him into the region they control on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Airport authorities in the eastern rebel stronghold of Goma blocked Kataliko
from disembarking from an aircraft and returning to his parish in Bukavu, where
he is based, rebel spokesman Kin-Kiey Mulumba said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kataliko has been an outspoken critic of the rebels and their Rwandan
allies, often accusing them of human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He is not persona non grata. But he is not welcome in Bukavu until
tensions there calm. He will be allowed back after some time,'' Mulumba said on
the telephone from Goma, 60 miles north of Bukavu.
</P>
<P>
	   Kataliko was traveling from the capital, Kinshasa. He was forced to fly on
to his native Bunia, in northern Congo, which is controlled by a different rebel
faction.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels had announced earlier in the week that they were planning to ban
the archbishop. On Friday, the Catholic church in Kinshasa insisted that rebels
had no right to do so. Church officials called his silencing an act of ``war
against freedom of expression, which conceals badly a new dictatorship under the
cover of the rebellion.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite a cease-fire six months ago between President Laurent Kabila and his
backers and the rebels and their backers, fighting in Congo has persisted and
the rebels control parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels say Kataliko was behind a protest in Bukavu last week, when
residents closed shops and schools to protest high taxes, insecurity and lack of
basic freedoms they blamed on the new rebel authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   In particular, the rebels accuse Kataliko of inciting hatred against
minority Tutsis from Congo and Rwanda. Tutsis make up a core of the rebellion
and have been repeatedly attacked by other tribes, often with weapons and
ammunition supplied by Kabila's army.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Bush, McCain Tied in S.C.  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John McCain and George W. Bush are locked in a dead heat
in the campaign to win the crucial South Carolina primary a week from now, says
a Newsweek poll released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor was supported by 43 percent and McCain, a senator from
Arizona, was supported by 40 percent in the poll conducted Wednesday through
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll supported the McCain camp's belief that it will need a heavy
turnout of independents to win in the state. McCain got the backing of 55
percent of independents in the poll, while Bush was backed by 53 percent of
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign turned sharply negative in recent days, a development that
could depress voter turnout and hurt McCain. His campaign announced late in the
week it would pull negative ads and focus on a more positive message. Bush's
campaign planned to keep up the aggressive approach against McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had an edge among conservatives, with almost half, while McCain had the
support of just over a third. McCain had an edge among moderate and liberal
likely voters in the GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
	   More than half said Bush would have the better chance of defeating the
Democratic Party's candidate, while 31 percent said that of McCain. Four out of
10 said McCain's experience as a Navy pilot and prisoner of war in Vietnam will
make them more likely to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
	   An analysis of the data by Princeton Survey Research Associates said
independents were as likely to vote as Republicans, and both were more likely to
vote in the primary as Democrats. Based on voting intentions in the poll at this
point, about six out of ten voters will be Republican, three out of 10
independents and one out of 10 would be Democratic. But the pollsters cautioned
that could shift with a week to go in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll of 507 South Carolina residents who intend to vote in the
Republican primary has an error margin of plus or minus 5 percentage points,
larger for subgroups.

<HEADLINE> Navy Moves From Puerto Rican Island  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- The Navy is moving a planned carrier exercise away
from the Puerto Rican island of Vieques, where residents have protested the
Navy's presence since a bomb killed a civilian security guard last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision to move the March exercise for the USS George Washington
carrier group was made because protesters are blocking the Vieques bombing
range, Rep. Joe Scarborough, R-Fla., said in a statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Navy has bombed, shelled and strafed the eastern edge of Vieques with
few restrictions for 60 years. But after an errant bomb killed a security guard
at the bombing range last April, protesters and pro-independence activists moved
in to demand that the Navy quit using the island.
</P>
<P>
	   The Navy insists there are no acceptable alternatives to Vieques as an
Atlantic training site.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton agreed last month to let Puerto Ricans hold a referendum
laying out two options: Let the Navy resume use of the range on its own terms,
including the use of live bombs, in exchange for new federal financial aid; or
require the Navy to cease all training by May 1, 2003.
</P>
<P>
	   A date for the referendum has not been set.
</P>
<P>
	   In a house-to-house survey commissioned by El Nuevo Dia newspaper Feb. 3-5
of 300 of the island's 9,400 residents, about 84 percent said they would choose
to evict the military. The survey had a 4 percent margin of error.
</P>
<P>
	   Moving the George Washington group's training to the Gulf of Mexico will
make it the largest Navy exercise held there in years. It will include bombing
runs at Eglin Air Force Base, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   A battle group includes eight to a dozen ships, 15,000 Navy and Marine Corps
personnel and about 80 tactical aircraft.

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Factions Rumble  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- In what would be his last act as Reform Party
national chairman, Jack Gargan asked the warring factions to stand together for
bigger matters.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's unity, for example, as outlined in the Pledge of Allegiance.
The 145 members of the National Committee rose, placed their hands over their
hearts, and promised to remain one nation, indivisible.
</P>
<P>
	   The tragedy of untimely death, for another. For the victims of the Alaska
Airlines crash off California, they fell silent, together, at Gargan's request.
</P>
<P>
	   Then chaos erupted at the Reform Party meeting at the Airport Marriott's
Capitol conference room. The factions had arrived ready to rumble.
</P>
<P>
	   The moment of silence ended in a firefight of insults, with Gargan at the
podium, shouting over the din that the meeting had been called illegally and his
opponents at their own microphones loudly beginning the process to oust him,
with some chanting ``Out! Out! Out!''.
</P>
<P>
	   Dale Barlow, a Gargan ally, jumped onstage in front of Gargan and hollered
at his detractors: ``I am ashamed of this party!''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Shut up, Dale!'' someone in the audience spat back.
</P>
<P>
	   More reminiscent of the Jerry Springer show than C-Span, bouncers helped
Barlow off the stage and routinely separated arguing Reform Party members.
</P>
<P>
	   The yelling, hollering, and even a shoving match between a woman who tried
to unplug Gargan's microphone and another who shoved her to the floor prompted
an anonymous call to the police. Eight officers threatened to shut the
proceedings down unless officials were able to conrtrol it.
</P>
<P>
	   Such was the long-anticipated effort by the faction loyal to Ross Perot to
oust Gargan, an ally of the party's major office-holder, Minnesota Gov. Jesse
Ventura. The political fisticuffs stretched outside Nashville.
</P>
<P>
	   A day earlier, Ventura quit the national party, calling it dysfunctional.''
Ronn Young, Gargan's treasurer, filed a lawsuit the same day against Perot's
allies who had held seats in the leadership the previous year and had yet to
turn over the party's records.
</P>
<P>
	   Ultimately, Gargan was overwhelmingly rejected by 109 members of the
162-member national commitee, enough to depose him. Gargan took to the
microphone and called the proceedings a sham.
</P>
<P>
	   Perot's allies booed him and walked out.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sit down! Order!'' yelled a man in the crowd. ``Sit down and be courteous
for Christ's sake!''
</P>
<P>
	   James Sheehan of Rhode Island rose and asked his fellow committee members to
focus once again on larger issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our children and grandchildren will not recall who was wrong and who was
right in the Reform Party in Nashville, Tenn., in the year 2000,'' Sheehan said.
``They will look back at us and they will say, 'They failed us.'''

<HEADLINE> More Jets Found With Tail Problems  </HEADLINE>
   By LEON DROUIN KEITH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Another airline under orders to look for signs of the
tail wing problem that may have caused the crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261
replaced jackscrews on two jets Saturday, bringing the number of aircraft with
similar problems to at least 10.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday ordered all airlines to
inspect their MD-80s, MD-90s, Boeing 717s and DC-9s -- about 1,200 planes in
all. The order was issued in response to the Jan. 31 Alaska Airlines crash that
killed all 88 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   Northwest Airlines found ``unidentified particles'' near jackscrews on two
DC-9 jets and replaced them Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The jets were taken out of service overnight so workers could replace the
device, which serves as a control mechanism in the tail wing. The jets were
scheduled to resume service by late Saturday afternoon, though their short
grounding prompted some flight cancellations and delays.
</P>
<P>
	   The 2-foot-long, rod-like jackscrew drives the stabilizer that helps keep
the plane level. The jackscrew recovered from the Flight 261 crash site had
damaged threads and metal shavings that appear to have come from its gimbal nut.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear whether the latest irregularities meant the planes posed a
threat to passengers.
</P>
<P>
	   The FAA is looking specifically for slivers of metal along jackscrews, but
mechanics are reporting anything unusual they find, said agency spokesman Eliot
Brenner.
</P>
<P>
	   Airline spokespeople said some of the planes were grounded after employees
found residue on jackscrews that did not necessarily contain metal shavings.
</P>
<P>
	   Airlines said Saturday a light travel weekend has kept the problems from
significantly disrupting air traffic.
</P>
<P>
	   The FAA ordered the inspections to be completed by Monday. The airlines have
until Wednesday to report their findings, Brenner said. Most airlines said
Saturday their companies had completed most of the required inspections and
expected to have the job finished by Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   The two jackscrews removed from Northwest DC-9s Saturday and another removed
Friday, were sent to the company's DC-9 maintenance center in Atlanta for
inspection. It will take a few days before further examination is completed,
airline spokesman Jon Austin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two Northwest employees who examined the first plane grounded disagreed over
whether there were any particles on a jackscrew, Austin said. The device was
replaced and the plane began flying again Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines has grounded at least three aircraft because of metal
shavings, the National Transportation Safety Board said.
</P>
<P>
	   Continental also found a metal shaving on a plane that was not in service
due to heavy routine maintenance it was undergoing.
</P>
<P>
	   Delta Air Lines grounded two of its planes Friday after employees discovered
residue around their jackscrews that officials think is ``nothing more than
normal wear,'' airline spokeswoman Peggy Estes said. NTSB investigators said
metal filings or shavings were reported on both Delta aircraft.
</P>
<P>
	   American Airlines on Friday discovered a jackscrew that had not been
properly lubricated, spokesman Chris Chiames said. The MD-90 was repaired,
inspected by the FAA and returned to service, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal crash investigators have not determined whether the damaged
horizontal stabilizer assembly found in Flight 261's wreckage caused the crash
or was a result of the crash's impact. Pilots had reported trouble with the
stabilizer before the crash.

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Bank Vies for Polish Bank  </HEADLINE>
    By MONIKA SCISLOWSKA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- German giant Deutsche Bank, seeking control over
Poland's fifth-largest bank, gained a one-vote majority Saturday on the
supervisory board of BIG Bank Gdanski at a tempestuous shareholders' meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Together with allies, Deutsche Bank won a vote to expand BIG's supervisory
board from nine to 19 members, then seated nine of its own members on it.
</P>
<P>
	   The 10th, swing vote came from the state-controlled PZU Zycie life insurer,
which switched sides to back Deutsche Bank last month.
</P>
<P>
	   The struggle coincides with a growing public debate over whether Poland
should allow foreign companies to take over its banks -- a sensitive sector in
any economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Over a decade of privatization since the fall of communism, the government
has allowed foreign banks to acquire big stakes in Polish enterprises. But
recently that policy has come under fire from lawmakers across the political
spectrum, who fear profits may trickle abroad instead of strengthening the
reforming economy.
</P>
<P>
	   In another fight, U.S.-based Citigroup and Germany's Commerzbank have been
competing for control of Poland's leading commercial bank, Bank Handlowy.
</P>
<P>
	   The battle seemed settled in favor of Citigroup after Commerzbank announced
Friday it would sell its 10 percent stake in Handlowy to the U.S. bank. The
decision was made after state-controlled insurer PZU decided to sell its key 34
percent stake in Handlowy to Citigroup. Citigroup was expected to announce its
deal on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   In the storm over BIG Bank, media reports said Deutsche Bank had asked
Polish regulators for permission to increase its stake in BIG to 33 percent,
from 13 percent, to consolidate and strengthen its position in Poland, a leading
trade partner for Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   But the German bank's opponents -- grouped around BIG Bank's management, the
Portuguese Banco Commercial Portugues and pan-European insurer Eureko -- were
opposed to the request. They said Deutsche Bank wanted to extend its own
activity through BIG rather than agree on a strategy to develop the Polish bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the new board said they would convene in the coming days to
constitute the board and, possibly, chose the chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   But the decisions may still be challenged by Polish regulators and the
courts. Deutsche Bank's opponents questioned the registration of PZU Zycie
votes, and pointed out it had clear instructions from its parent, PZU, to vote
against Deutsche Bank or allow PZU to vote its shares. The opponents said they
might call an extraordinary shareholders' meeting.

<HEADLINE> Nine Indicted in La. Jail Takeover  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN CLENDENNING Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Eight Cubans and a Bahamian accused of holding hostages
during the six-day takeover of the St. Martin Parish Jail in December have been
indicted on state kidnapping charges that carry mandatory life sentences.
</P>
<P>
	   Only three -- two Cubans and the Bahamian -- will immediately face the
charges because the rest of the Cubans were sent back to their home country
after the standoff.
</P>
<P>
	   The indictment on Friday will ensure that the six could be arrested and
tried if they ever re-enter this country, District Attorney Phil Haney said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My experience tells me we have deported people outside of the U.S. for
other crimes and we've had them show back up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The prison warden, three deputies and several female inmates were taken
hostage Dec. 13 at the jail in St. Martinville, about 100 miles west of New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
	   The hostage-takers, most of them being detained for the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said they rebelled because they had served their prison
sentences but were being held indefinitely awaiting deportation. For Cubans, the
wait can take years because the United States does not have a deportation
agreement with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The six who were returned to Cuba were jailed after their arrival. Cuban
officials said they planned to investigate the case.
</P>
<P>
	   One Cuban, Roberto Villar, was left behind. Federal officials say they took
him off the plane bound for Cuba because of an allegation that he had raped a
female inmate during the standoff. But authorities in St. Martin Parish say they
never made such an allegation.
</P>
<P>
	   A second Cuban named in the indictment, Miguel Canton, also remained in this
country. Haney said Canton, who is in INS custody, was involved in the takeover
for several days.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bahamian, Anthony Deveaux, is being held at the St. Martin Parish Jail.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- An American woman who had been detained in Beijing for a
week as part of a roundup of Falun Gong practitioners returned to New York City
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Tracy Zhao, 30, arrived at LaGuardia Airport, where she was met by her
mother and the cheers of supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   According to her boyfriend, Lin Chong-li, Zhao did not join the Feb. 4
protest in Tiananmen Square, but was there to observe it and show support.
</P>
<P>
	   She was among at least 50 Falun Gong followers detained at the protest.
Police kicked, punched and dragged many of the demonstrators before putting them
in vans and driving them away.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chinese government banned Falun Gong in July as a menace to the public
and a threat to Communist Party control.
</P>
<P>
	   Zhao, a Northwest Airlines flight attendant, was born in Beijing and moved
to the United States at age 20. She had been practicing Falun Gong for about a
year, according to her mother, Yan Zuo.
</P>
<P>
	   Zhao was visiting Beijing to celebrate the lunar new year with family and to
find out how Falun Gong members in China were being treated, Yan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Falun Gong was founded in 1992 by a former Chinese government clerk who now
lives in New York. It has millions of followers drawn to its mix of slow-motion
exercises, Buddhist and Taoist cosmology and message of moral living.

<HEADLINE> Airline Makes Unscheduled Landing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) -- A Continental Airlines DC-10 made an
unscheduled landing Saturday in the capital of Newfoundland after a light went
on, indicating the possibility of smoke in the cabin.
</P>
<P>
	   Fires trucks, ambulances and police vehicles were scrambled to the runway
before a Continental Airlines DC-10 touched down safely. There were no reports
of injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A light did go on, but there was no smoke, no fire. It was a
misindication, a false signal. The plane is getting ready to go back into
service,'' said Catherine Stengel, a spokeswoman for the Houston-based airline.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It could have been a blown fuse. They're not sure what caused the light to
go on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane's pilot reportedly asked to land at St. John's Airport, saying an
air-conditioning unit in a cargo hold beneath the cockpit apparently overheated,
sending smoke into the cabin.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane was en route to Newark, N.J., from Paris when the emergency
occurred.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of passengers onboard wasn't immediately known. No additional
information was immediately available.

<HEADLINE> Austrians Continue Govt. Protests  </HEADLINE>
   By MELISSA EDDY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Vienna's streets took on a carnival atmosphere
Saturday as Austrians continued their peaceful protests against the new
government inaugurated last week.
</P>
<P>
	   The appointment of the government, which includes the right-wing Freedom
Party of Joerg Haider, has generated a wave of protest in Austria and abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   Around 2,000 people representing different political and interest groups
gathered at Vienna's main railway station in the early afternoon for a march
down one of the city's busiest shopping streets. By the time the march reached
the parliament building, the crowd had swelled to about 5,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to organizers' requests for peaceful demonstrations, protesters
carried banners and European Union flags and made noise with pots, pans,
whistles, drums and shakers. The crowd -- organized by communist, socialist and
union groups -- included parents carrying children and foreigners living in
Austria.
</P>
<P>
	   By evening, the protesters arrived at the Karl Marx Hof, a public housing
complex built in the 1920s that was the scene of heavy fighting during the
Austrian civil war between communists and fascists in the early 1930s.
</P>
<P>
	   As the crowd moved past the apartment buildings, many residents opened their
windows and waved. In one window, a man shook a tambourine in rhythm with the
drum beat accompanying the marchers. Two fire-eaters perched on the pedestal of
a statue in front of the buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the marchers, a 28-year-old musician who would give only his first
name, Helmut, said he approved of the diplomatic measures taken by the European
Union and Israel against the new government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's actually not so bad,'' he said. ``Only when reactions came
from abroad did people here wake up to what is happening. It was necessary.''
</P>
<P>
	   The musician said he had launched his own e-mail campaign urging wind
instrument musicians to join him. He was accompanied by about 15 musicians
playing their instruments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The European Union should not tolerate someone like Haider playing any
role in government,'' said another protester, Rudiger Landgraf. Landgraf said
the protests might not be having a huge political effect, ``but symbolically
it's a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
	   A truck with a calypso band brought up the rear of the march.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day 2,000 Austrians held a peaceful demonstration in the
western city of Innsbruck; 3,000 demonstrated in Linz, about 75 miles west of
Vienna; and 400 protested in Feldkirch, on the Austrian-Swiss border, the
Austrian Press Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Demonstrations have been peaceful since violence broke out on the night the
new government was inaugurated.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere Saturday, several hundred demonstrators gathered in front of the
Austrian embassy in Budapest, Hungary to show support for Haider's party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are here to express solidarity with Austria's much-attacked,
democratically elected new government,'' said Andreas Tasnadi, leader of the
youth movement of Hungary's far-right Hungarian Truth and Life Party (MIEP).
While he spoke, the crowd chanted ``Long live Haider,'' and ``Long live
Austrian-Hungarian friendship.''
</P>
<P>
	   MIEP is similar in philosophy to the Freedom Party. Since 1998, it has been
represented in Hungary's parliament with 12 deputies.

Reform Party Chairman Voted Out
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- During a hostile meeting today a Reform party
committee voted out chairman Jack Gargan. By a 109-31 vote, the committee dumped
Gargan on a motion that said "he has failed to faithfully perform and execute
the duties of his office." The vote was pushed for by allies of party founder
Ross Perot. Gargan is affiliated with Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, who left the
national party yesterday and urged the Minnesota state party to break away. No
successor to Gargan has been chosen.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John McCain and George W. Bush are locked in a dead heat
in the campaign to win the South Carolina primary a week from now, says a
Newsweek poll released today. The Texas governor was supported by 43 percent and
McCain, a senator from Arizona, was supported by 40 percent in the poll
conducted Wednesday through Friday. The poll supported the McCain camp's belief
that it will need a heavy turnout of independents to win in the state. McCain
got the backing of 55 percent of independents in the poll, while Bush was backed
by 53 percent of Republicans.

that may have caused the crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261, Continental
Airlines replaced jackscrews on two jets today, bringing the number of aircraft
with similar problems to at least 10. The Federal Aviation Administration on
Thursday ordered all airlines to inspect their MD-80s, MD-90s, Boeing 717s and
DC-9s -- about 1,200 planes in all. The order was issued in response to the Jan.

Cyanide Spill Creeps Through Europe

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A cyanide spill that killed virtually all life
in a major European river is considered by officials to be Europe's worst
environmental disaster since Chernobyl. The spill originated in northwest
Romania, where a dam at the Baia Mare gold mine overflowed Jan. 30 and caused
cyanide to pour into streams. From there, the polluted water flowed west into
the Tisa River in neighboring Hungary and then on into Yugoslavia. Eighty
percent of the fish in the Tisa have died since the contaminant entered the
country two days ago, said Mayor Atila Juhas of the northern town Senta.

Navy Moves From Puerto Rican Island

	   PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- The Navy is moving a planned carrier exercise away
from the Puerto Rican island of Vieques, where residents have protested the
Navy's presence since a bomb killed a civilian security guard last year. The
decision to move the March exercise for the USS George Washington carrier group
was made because protesters are blocking the Vieques bombing range, Rep. Joe
Scarborough, R-Fla., said in a statement Friday. The Navy has bombed, shelled
and strafed the eastern edge of Vieques with few restrictions for 60 years. But
after an errant bomb killed a security guard at the bombing range last April,
protesters and pro-independence activists moved in to demand that the Navy quit
using the island.

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Ousts Chairman Gargan  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Ross Perot's Reform Party ousted party chairman
Jack Gargan, an ally of dissident Jesse Ventura, during a Saturday showdown that
exploded almost immediately with raw hostility and scuffling. At one point,
local police threatened to shut down the proceedings, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee, by a 109-31 vote, ousted Gargan on a motion that said ``he
has failed to faithfully perform and execute the duties of his office.'' One
person abstained. They picked Pat Choate, who was Perot's running mate in 1996
to be the new chairman, by a 101-29 margin.
</P>
<P>
	   The motion said Gargan's failures and violations of the party's constitution
``have resulted in substantial harm to the public image of the party, and in a
breakdown of the proper administration, operation and governance of the party.''
</P>
<P>
	   The name of Ventura, the governor of Minnesota who quit the national party
Friday, did not come up during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the action in Nashville, Ventura said Saturday: ``It saddens me, but it
doesn't surprise me. That's why I made the decision I made yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ventura noted that Gargan had won the chairmanship ``fair and square'' in
July at the national convention in Dearborn, Mich. Gargan said after the meeting
in Nashville that ``the cards were stacked'' against him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This was not the Reform Party that I know,'' he said. ``This is not the
party of honesty and integrity. This was a sham.''
</P>
<P>
	   The subsequent votes were also taken to remove Gerry Moan, who's the vice
chairman and a Perot ally, he overwhelming survived a challenge, but treasurer
Ronn Young, an ally of Gargan, was voted out. They also affirmed by a voice vote
that Long Beach, Calif. would be site of their convention this summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Gargan vowed to fight back. Earlier Gargan had cried out ``it's an illegal
meeting!'' as the audience chanted that he be turned ``out, out out!'' from his
post.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, a Perot ally who identified herself only as Melanie of San
Diego rushed the front of the room and tried to unplug Gargan's microphone
because he wouldn't call the meeting to order.
</P>
<P>
	   Gargan supporter Sue Harris de Bauche of Virginia slapped and pushed Melanie
to the floor, and two police officers separated the two. One escorted Harris de
Bauche from the room, as it rang with members telling each other to ``shut up''
and begin the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Democracy can be messy, can't it?'' said Donna Donovan, spokeswoman for
the Perot faction.
</P>
<P>
	   That's one way of describing months of infighting so fierce that members of
the party founded by Ross Perot openly speculated about whether it would survive
to participate credibly in this year's presidential race.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the Internet, in court and in the press, the factions have battled over
everything from the location of the party's nominating convention, its
philosophical direction, its procedures and even whether certain national
committee members were qualified to be present on Saturday. For months, a move
has been afoot to oust Gargan, Ventura's hand-picked chairman who took his post
in January.
</P>
<P>
	   Certain that enough votes existed to oust Gargan, Ventura fired a preemptive
strike at the national party Friday by quitting, branding the organization
``dysfunctional'' and urging the Minnesota state party to break away.
</P>
<P>
	   The same day, treasurer Young filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the
Western District of Virginia seeking the party's financial records, which he
says were never turned over to him by his predecessors, who are loyal to Perot.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, Minnesota Reform Party leaders approved a special state
convention March 4 to consider the split from the national party.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Nashville meeting, Gargan's allies were far outnumbered by Perot's,
and both sides arrived in the conference room at the Nashville Airport Marriott
poised for a squabble. Gargan got a few steps inside the ropes marking the
meeting zone when he was surrounded by Perot loyalists who objected to Gargan's
two attorneys accompanying him.
</P>
<P>
	   Finally taking the podium, Gargan was able to find two areas of common
ground when he asked participants to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance, and
remain standing for a moment of silence in memory of those killed in the Alaska
Airlines crash last week.
</P>
<P>
	   That was the last moment of peaceful assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   From the podium, Gargan began making his case that the meeting was illegally
called because members were given fewer than the required 30 days of notice. He
was immediately shouted down by Perot's allies.
</P>
<P>
	   From microphones scattered throughout the audience, motions were made to
oust Gargan from chairing the meeting. He refused to leave the podium and
continued trying to make his case.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, about eight Nashville police officers who had responded to an
anonymous 911 call gathered outside the conference room, according to Kathryn
Seibel of Tennessee, who organized much of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They said they would shut it down if we didn't get it under control,''
Seibel said. ``I said this was a temporary blip.''
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, Gargan agreed to step aside after the members voted 95-14 to install
Tom McLaughlin of Pennsylvania as the new chairman of the meeting. Gargan agreed
to sit at the edge of the stage while McLaughlin and party secretary Jim Mangia
reviewed the challenges to delegates representing 11 states. By voice vote, they
reaffirmed their plans to hold their convention in Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   Like most of Perot's supporters, Seibel vowed to heal the party. But she
recalled wistfully the previous night, when she had dinner with other members
and discussed public policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You would have been impressed; we were talking about light rail, campaign
finance reform,'' Seibel said.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked how she felt about the developments, she said, ``I'm mortified.''

<HEADLINE> Largest Oil Refinery Secures $600M  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) -- The largest oil refinery in
the Western Hemisphere has received $600 million in financing to build a crude
oil processing plant and repay bank debts, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Construction at the Hovensa refinery in the U.S. Virgin Islands will begin
by June and should be completed by June 2002, Hovensa Vice President Alex
Moorhead said Friday. The plant will convert pitch, the least valuable portion
of crude oil, into higher-value products.
</P>
<P>
	   Bank of America is the lead underwriter to finance the new project and debt,
Moorhead said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hovensa was formed in October 1998 when Amerada Hess Corp. joined Petroleos
de Venezuela S.A. in a joint venture to operate Hess' St. Croix refinery. Its
refining capacity of 545,000 barrels a day is the hemisphere's largest.
</P>
<P>
	   With 2,000 workers, the refinery is also the Virgin Islands' biggest private
employer.

<HEADLINE> Some Cubans Feel 'Elian Fatigue'  </HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GUTKIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- It's hard to find anyone on the streets of Havana who doesn't
think Elian Gonzalez should be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   But once they get past the party line, Cubans can be surprisingly frank
about what they think of the international custody battle over the 6-year-old
boy.
</P>
<P>
	   Some say they think Cuban President Fidel Castro is using the case for
political ends. Others say they're just plain sick of hearing about Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's the same thing all the time. It gets tiring,'' said Carlos Ortiz, a
young man who asked to end the interview when he noticed a policeman staring at
him.
</P>
<P>
	   Although opinion polls don't exist here, there's no doubt that most Cubans
believe the little boy rescued at sea and now living with a great uncle in Miami
should be returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
	   Interviewed in bars and in restaurants, on street corners and in food
markets, Cubans said failure to return Elian would amount to breaking up a
family and keeping a father from the son he loves.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not a political problem. It's a human problem,'' said 25-year-old
accountant Maryanis Romero.
</P>
<P>
	   But it's also clear that a certain amount of Elian fatigue has set in. The
island's communist government has turned the case into a major national crusade,
staging daily public rallies, bombarding the airwaves with news about the boy's
``kidnapping,'' and plastering the walls of major cities with ``Save Elian''
posters.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost every evening, Castro himself joins Elian's father and grandparents
in elaborate demonstrations for the boy's return accompanied by choir and dance
performances and speeches extolling Cuba's communist revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube in the Atlantic on Nov. 25 after
the boat he was riding in sank. His mother and 10 other people on the boat died
in an attempt to reach U.S. shores.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. relatives taking of Elian believe the boy should not be returned,
saying his mother died trying to bring him to freedom. Cuba says keeping him in
the United States is a violation of international law.
</P>
<P>
	   One woman, Carmen Vasquez, said she thinks Castro is capitalizing on the
Elian case to stir up revolutionary fervor and divert attention away from the
country's economic ills.
</P>
<P>
	   A man, Jorge Vasquez, recalled with amusement a rumor now making its way
through Havana that a television announcer was fired after forgetting to turn
off his microphone and saying on the air that he was sick of reading news about
Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was just saying what a lot of us think,'' Jorge said. State-run
television employees said the incident never occurred.
</P>
<P>
	   Another man, Eugenio Izquierdo, said he believed Elian's father and
grandparents, now celebrities in Cuba, were receiving economic favors from the
government, and that those privileges could end once Elian is returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Alexander Rodriguez, 24, said he doesn't understand why Elian's father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, hasn't traveled to Miami to pick up his son personally.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would go to the bowels of the earth to get my son,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rodriguez'sfriend, Keyner Piedra, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If they kidnapped his son, they could kidnap him, too,'' he insisted.
</P>
<P>
	   At that, Izquierdo said the government was wrong to call Elian's situation a
``kidnapping.''

<HEADLINE> IMF Retracts Criticism of Brazil  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund has retracted
criticism of Brazil's anti-poverty plan following an outburst of nationalist
indignation and calls for IMF representative Lorenzo Perez to be kicked out of
the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Perez released a statement late Friday saying the government's explanation
of the plan had convinced him that it would not endanger Brazil's ability to
reduce its debt. Reducing the debt and a chronic budget deficit are parts of
Brazil's 1998 agreement with the IMF for a $41.5 billion bailout loan.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Perez had openly questioned the wisdom of the proposed 10-year
anti-poverty program, which would cost $2.3 billion a year. Most of the money
would come from the privatization of government property, which Brazil now uses
to defray a huge domestic debt of about $294 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   "Brazil already spends a significant amount of money on social programs,"
Perez said in the first statement. "This money has to be used more effectively."
</P>
<P>
	   The statement managed to unite the political right and left in outrage.
Senate President Antonio Carlos Magalhaes of the rightist Liberal Front Party
said it was "undue meddling" in the nation's affairs. Rep. Jose Dirceu of the
leftist Workers Party urged the government to send Perez home.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1980s, when Brazil went broke and was bailed out by the IMF, many
Brazilians blamed the Washington-based fund for the recession that ensued.
IMF-bashing rallies were common.
</P>
<P>
	   Anti-IMF sentiment erupted again in 1991, when IMF economist Jose Fajgenbaum
observed that structural reforms in the economy would require changing the
constitution. Then-President Fernando Collor de Mello said Fajgenbaum should "go
reform his own house."

<P>
   ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) -- A Continental Airlines DC-10 made an
unscheduled landing Saturday in the capital of Newfoundland after a light went
on, indicating the possibility of smoke in the cabin.
</P>
<P>
	   Fires trucks, ambulances and police vehicles were scrambled to the runway
before a Continental Airlines DC-10 touched down safely. There were no reports
of injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A light did go on, but there was no smoke, no fire. It was a
misindication, a false signal. The plane is getting ready to go back into
service,'' said Catherine Stengel, a spokeswoman for the Houston-based airline.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It could have been a blown fuse. They're not sure what caused the light to
go on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane's pilot reportedly asked to land at St. John's Airport, saying an
air-conditioning unit in a cargo hold beneath the cockpit apparently overheated,
sending smoke into the cabin.
</P>

p.m. but was rescheduled to land at 7:20 p.m.

<HEADLINE> Hijacked Plane Crew Explains Escape  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BARR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- The crew of a hijacked Afghan airliner decided to escape
after despairing of persuading their captors to surrender, a flight captain said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The four members of the flight crew, who say they all want to return to
Afghanistan, talked with reporters Saturday, two days after the hijackers
surrendered at Stansted airport, north of London.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers took over the Ariana jet last Sunday during what should have
been a short domestic flight from the Afghan capital of Kabul to the northern
town of Mazar-e-Sharif. By the time the crew scrambled out a cockpit window
Tuesday night, it had spent nearly two full days with the hijackers and had been
unable to persuade them to give up, said Nabi, the second captain on the flight.
Like many Afghans, he uses only one name.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Finally, we saw we could not do anything. We thought if we escaped, the
hijackers would be stranded and probably would not dare to harm any
passengers,'' Nabi said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the worst moment for the crew came Monday morning at daybreak, when
the hijackers first saw that the aircraft was surrounded by armed security
personnel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They became very hysterical and very nervous,'' and threatened to kill
some of the passengers, Nabi said. He did not say how calm was restored.
</P>
<P>
	   Police have said the hijackers also became extremely agitated after
discovering the crew had escaped. One flight attendant bore the brunt of their
wrath and was shoved down the back stairs of the Boeing 727.
</P>
<P>
	   Said Mehdi Saidi, the first captain, said the crew did not attempt to resist
the hijackers when they first took over the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The hijackers entered the aircraft cockpit and rushed inside with pistols
and very bad faces,'' he said. ``The crew told them: 'Don't do anything please.
What is your command? We will follow your command.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the passengers from the flight were preparing to move to an
immigration center in western England on Saturday, the government said. Some 74
of them have applied for asylum in England, and police are questioning 22 others
who are suspected of involvement in the hijacking.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain's Foreign Office said late Friday that Britain has been holding
talks with countries near Afghanistan about ``various aspects'' of the
hijacking, but did not elaborate. A spokeswoman denied a report in the Sunday
Telegraph that Pakistan had been approached specifically because of its Afghan
community, with a view to sending all the freed hostages there.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper said Prime Minister Tony Blair's office did not want to
endanger the freed hostages by sending them back to Afghanistan, but wanted to
send out a message that Britain is not a ``soft touch'' for asylum seekers.

<HEADLINE> Scholars Seek New Image of God  </HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM McCALL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) -- Former archbishop of South Africa Desmond Tutu
joined several prominent theologians on Saturday to urge religious leaders to
work together to find a new image of God for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No religion can claim to have the whole truth about the mystery'' of
faith, Tutu said. ``The logic of faith will get through to even the dumbest of
us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, spoke at a news conference before he
addressed the ``God at 2000'' conference at Oregon State University.
</P>
<P>
	   Tutu ended the two-day conference with an address that followed traditional
Christian teachings, talking about a masculine, judgmental God more interested
in individual sinners than the universe.
</P>
<P>
	   He credited prayer with helping resolve apartheid in South Africa and called
on people to pray for resolution of conflicts in places such as Northern Ireland
and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   Tutu also urged Christians to embrace other faiths.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Gandhi was not a Christian, but if you say Gandhi was not a good man, you
are not speaking my language,'' Tutu said.
</P>
<P>
	   Author and theologian Marcus Borg, who teaches at Oregon State, invited Tutu
and five of the world's most influential religious scholars to talk about how
the image of God has changed.
</P>
<P>
	   Borg opened the conference Friday by saying his view of God changed
dramatically from the stern lawgiver he learned about as a boy to a God that is
beyond the understanding of any religion and ``dwelling within each of us.''
</P>
<P>
	   He challenged Christians to open themselves to other religions that see God
as the entire universe, and to reject ``supernatural theism,'' or reducing God
to human dimensions as an individual personality who meddles with the universe.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the other speakers were Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, an author and National
Public Radio commentator who specializes in studies of Jewish mysticism; Seyyed
Hossein Nasr, a George Washington University professor considered one of the
world's foremost scholars on Islam; Joan Chittister, a Benedictine nun and
author; and Karen Armstrong, a former Roman Catholic nun turned TV commentator
in Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   Chittister said a more feminine image of God is needed because the Earth is
in danger from overpopulation and pollution, and needs nurturing, not
punishment. But she added that any image of God should be beyond ``any color or
gender.''
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong said she has drawn her image of God from three major Western
religions: Judaism, Islam and Christianity.
</P>
<P>
	   She said compassion and the ``Golden Rule'' of treating others with
compassion was perhaps more important than seeking God in a church or through
religion.

<HEADLINE> Florida Judge OKs Lethal Injection  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE SCHNEIDER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A judge on Saturday gave state corrections officials
the go-ahead to carry out Florida's first lethal injection since the state
changed its primary execution method from the electric chair.
</P>
<P>
	   Circuit Judge O.H. Eaton Jr. rejected arguments that the method was
unconstitutional and that corrections officials were ill prepared.
</P>
<P>
	   Death row inmate Terry Sims had challenged the constitutionality of the
state's new lethal injection law, passed last month. His execution is scheduled
for Feb. 23 for the death for the 1977 murder of a retired New York City Police
officer during a pharmacy robbery.
</P>
<P>
	   Sims' attorney, Steven Malone, had argued during a two-day hearing last week
that the chances of a botched execution using lethal injection were significant
and could cause Sims pain and suffering in violation of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A foul-up on this can be a horrifying and excruciatingly painful death,''
Malone said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Sims has an appeal before the Florida Supreme Court and arguments are
scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   During the hearing, Florida State Prison Warden James Crosby couldn't answer
questions about what chemicals or dosages would be used during the lethal
injection. Malone said that and the lack of detailed instructions in writing
showed that state corrections officials weren't prepared to carry out lethal
injections.
</P>
<P>
	   Malone also argued that Sims didn't have enough information from the
Department of Corrections to choose a method of execution. The new law gives
death row inmates the option of choosing the electric chair, but corrections
officials will opt for lethal injection if inmates refuse to make a decision.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge disagreed with the argument, saying all Sims needed was a general
knowledge of the execution methods, which corrections officials had provided.

Choate Picked As Reform Chair

	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Reform Party today named Pat Choate as their
new chairman after allies of Ross Perot ousted incumbent Jack Gargan from the
position. Choate was Perot's running mate when the Texas billionaire ran for
president in 1996. A committee, by a 109-31 vote, voted Gargan out on a motion
that said "he has failed to faithfully perform and execute the duties of his
office." Gargan is affiliated with Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, who left the
national party yesterday and urged the Minnesota state party to break away.

in South Carolina a week from now. The Texas governor was supported by 43
percent and McCain, a senator from Arizona, was supported by 40 percent in the
survey conducted Wednesday through Friday. The poll supported the McCain camp's
belief that it will need a heavy turnout of independents to win in the state.
McCain got the backing of 55 percent of independents in the poll, while Bush was

during the six-day takeover of the St. Martin Parish Jail in December have been
indicted on state kidnapping charges that carry mandatory life sentences. Only
three -- two Cubans and the Bahamian -- will immediately face the charges
because the rest of the Cubans were sent back to their home country after the
standoff. The hostage-takers, most of them being detained for the U.S.

<HEADLINE> Cyanide Spill Hits Yugoslav Town  </HEADLINE>
   By MISHA SAVIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In what may be Europe's worst environmental
disaster since Chernobyl, a cyanide spill contaminating a major river has moved
into Yugoslavia and destroyed all life in the water, local officials said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The spill originated in northwest Romania, near the border town of Oradea,
where a dam at the Baia Mare gold mine overflowed Jan. 30 and caused cyanide to
pour into streams. From there, the polluted water flowed west into the Tisa
River in neighboring Hungary and then on into Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
	   A cyanide solution is used to separate gold ore from surrounding rock.
</P>
<P>
	   Eighty percent of the fish in the Tisa have died since the contaminant
entered the country two days ago, said Mayor Atila Juhas of the northern town
Senta.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Enormous quantities of dead fish are floating on the surface, and the
spill continues to spread,'' Juhas said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
	   By Saturday noon, the concentration of cyanide in the water at the point
where Tisa enters Yugoslavia from Hungary was 0.07 milligrams per liter, down
from 0.13 milligrams several hours earlier, Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   But the worst-polluted part of the flow was moving south, and more serious
damage was expected later when the polluted waters reach the Danube River,
probably early Sunday. The spill was moving at about 2.5 mph.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Tisa is a dead river. All life in it, from algae to trout, has been
destroyed,'' said Istvan Backulin, the mayor of another affected town in the
north. ``The spill is leaving nothing alive.''
</P>
<P>
	   Officials from several northern Yugoslav towns held an emergency meeting in
Senta on Saturday, and urged locals to collect the fish in efforts to reduce
levels of the pollution.
</P>
<P>
	   Restaurants in the region have already removed fish from their menus, and
the alarm has spread south as far as the capital, Belgrade, which lies on the
Danube some 80 miles to the south.
</P>
<P>
	   Juhas said drinking water would be safe since supplies come from wells far
enough from the river. However, wildlife in the area near the river is in
serious danger, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hungary's environmental minister, Pal Pepo, said only quick action from
well-organized catastrophe-prevention work had prevented damage to human health.
</P>
<P>
	   Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban has called for the appointment of a
government commissioner to coordinate damage assessment, international legal
steps, and clean-up projects.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a European-dimension catastrophe,'' the EU transport and energy
commissioner, Loyola de Palacio, told reporters on Thursday after talks in
Budapest with Hungarian Foreign Minister Janos Martonyi.
</P>
<P>
	   Local ecologists said it could take years before marine life reappears in
the Tisa, according to Beta news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   The cyanide spill adds to the ecological strain of high pollution levels in
Yugoslavia already, caused last year by NATO bombing that targeted oil
refineries and factories.
</P>
<P>
	   Though Tanjug reported that authorities were taking ``adequate measures''
along the affected waterway, Juhas said nobody from the government in Belgrade
showed up for the Senta meeting or provided assistance.

<HEADLINE> Music Pioneer George Jackson Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- George Jackson, a former president of Motown Records who
produced the movies of some of Hollywood's leading black actors, has died. He
was 42.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson died in New York on Thursday after suffering a stroke, the Los
Angeles Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   He co-produced the films ``A Thin Line Between Love and Hate'' starring
Martin Lawrence, ``New Jack City'' with Wesley Snipes and ``Krush Groove''
starring Blair Underwood. Other films included ``Jason's Lyric'' and the second
and third installments of the ``House Party'' series featuring the hip-hop duo
Kid N' Play.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In a business that is very self-centered and is very tough to stay in,
George helped everyone, whether he was in competition with them or not,'' said
Doug McHenry, who co-founded Elephant Walk Entertainment with Jackson.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson also co-produced UPN's ``Malcolm &AMP; Eddie'' comedy under the Elephant
Walk banner.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson's most recent effort was creating Urban Box Office Network,
described as a media company for the ``urban mindset.'' UBO will establish a
media lab in Harlem to honor Jackson, McHenry said.
</P>
<P>
	   A Harvard University graduate, Jackson became president and chief executive
of Motown in 1997. He oversaw several acts, including the group 98 Degrees and
the Temptations.
</P>
<P>
	   McHenry and Jackson considered the films they made to be ``edutainment'' --
movies that both educated and entertained. Jackson described his philosophy in
1991, saying: ``What we try to do is connect all of the many aspects of our
community into our stories.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson is survived by his wife, Yuko; daughter, Kona Rose; mother, Henie
Hogan Jackson Stancil; sister, Dr. Sharon Jackson; and brother, Bobbie Stancil.

<HEADLINE> McCain Revs Up Campaign in S.C.  </HEADLINE>
   By LEIGH STROPE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DARLINGTON, S.C. (AP) -- John McCain hit 100 mph in a spin around
Darlington's famed speedway Saturday and George W. Bush told people in Columbia
he's ``a tough competitor'' and hinted he's found a policy mistake by the McCain
campaign to use against him in next week's debate.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain kept his campaign in high gear with several town meetings and other
stops the rest of the weekend. Bush made a couple of campaign stops in the
state, before heading back to Austin to spend some time with family, returning
to the campaign trail on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   As Bush was telling an audience at a Columbia restaurant that ``my faith
allowed me to handle a short-term adversity,'' McCain was hopping behind the
wheel of a blue Pontiac Grand Prix NASCAR's Darlington Raceway for a few turns
around the track Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The most important news of the day is I went over 100 miles an hour,''
McCain said. ``I hope I do a better job driving this car than I did on my last
mission.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was a Vietnam POW after his plane was shot down over Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
	   The candidate jumped in the car wearing a suit and tie -- but not a helmet
-- and had his wife Cindy in the passenger seat. He gave a thumbs-up to track
officials and reporters before flooring the gas pedal, kicking up dust in his
wake. He took two laps around the track, stopping once for photographers, and
then emerged from the car with a huge grin.
</P>
<P>
	   The Darlington track has a rich tradition in South Carolina politics. Bob
Dole in 1995 explored the early stages of his presidential bid here and other
candidates have made the mandatory campaign stop at Darlington. The track is in
the heart of tobacco country, where McCain's sponsorship of failed legislation
to raise taxes on tobacco has been a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier the Arizona senator walked through a neighborhood in nearby
Florence, knocking on doors and asking for votes. He surprised Steve Coker, who
answered his door with his children peering from behind him, hiding from the
television cameras.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He'll let all his work show,'' Coker said of McCain. ``We know all about
the Keating Five, we know he's divorced, we're not guessing about his drug
use.''
</P>
<P>
	   Both campaigns on Saturday were still preoccupied with campaign tactics,
trading attacks on everything from push polling to rude telephone calls to
fund-raising. Bush told reporters Saturday that his campaign has hearing from
supporters that they're getting calls from someone claiming to be with the Bush
campaign, who starts ``trashmouthing'' the person answering the phone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I warn the people of South Carolina, Republicans, if you get a phone call
from some voice purporting to be me that is rude, just ignore it,'' Bush said.
``I can assure you our people are not calling to make it hard for me to win the
election.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush did not blame the calls on McCain. Earlier in the week, McCain demanded
that the Bush campaign stop calling voters and misleading them about his record
after a woman complained her 14-year-old son received such a call. The woman
didn't know if the Bush campaign had made the call.
</P>
<P>
	   State Sen. Mike Fair of Greenville told Bush at Seawell's Restaurant in
Columbia that the Bush campaign ``hasn't even hit (McCain's) soft spots.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm going to,'' Bush said in a conversation picked up by boom mikes
overhead. ``But I'm not going to do it on TV.''
</P>
<P>
	   Campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer said Bush was referring to ``a major policy
blunder McCain made this week'' and hinting that he would bring it in Tuesday
night's debate.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush South Carolina spokesman Tucker Eskew said Bush was not referring to
any change in television advertising strategy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator McCain had hoped his olive branch would be taken up by Governor
Bush, but it appears by Governor Bush's own comments he intends to continue his
push polling and other negative tactics,'' said McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky,
who said he didn't know what policy area the Bush people were referring to.
``That's too bad. The people of South Carolina deserve better.''
</P>
<P>
	   A Newsweek poll out Saturday showed the race was a dead heat, with Bush
doing better among Republicans and McCain better among independents.
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire, McCain rode his strong support from both groups to an
18-point victory. Bush said Saturday that his faith sustained him after his loss
there. But he told the crowd of about 100 at Seawell's Restaurant that he's wary
of people in public office who say: ``Vote for me, I'm more religious than my
neighbor.'''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Faith, to me, is strength. It puts life in perspective. I recognize that
I'm a humble sinner and I've sought redemption, and I recognize that I'm no
better than anybody else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   After his visit to the capital city of Columbia, Bush traveled to Orangeburg
for a speech and question-and-answer session before a crowd of more than a
thousand. Then he flew back to Texas to spend Sunday with his family. Bush
planned to spend the rest of the week in South Carolina after his return on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush campaign was also looking ahead to future primaries. In California,
Bush is launching his ad campaign with the positive ``reformer with results''
spot, a seven-figure buy running for the next couple weeks in large media
markets such as Los Angeles and in heavily Republican areas, including
Bakersfield and San Diego. The McCain campaign has said it will spend less than
the $12.5 million allowed by state law and expects to be outspent 2-to-1 by
Bush.

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Gore Vie for Calif. Votes  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- With the room stacked against him and polls giving
his opponent nearly a 4-1 lead in the state, Bill Bradley argued passionately
for converts Saturday at the California Democratic convention. Vice President Al
Gore warned Bradley is not a ``real Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
	   In back-to-back speeches as different as night and day, Gore debuted his
most ruthless offensive yet in this increasingly bitter contest. Bradley offered
a romantic vision of the party that hopes to hold the White House, highlighting
goals of universal health care and elimination of child poverty.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have in our best moments always been the party of big ideas and big
ideals,'' Bradley said. And between him and Gore, ``There is a difference in
boldness.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore had only to clasp raised fists with Gov. Gray Davis in a victory salute
to demonstrate his muscle in California.
</P>
<P>
	   Relying on note cards, Gore said Bradley has ``attacked'' and ``demeaned''
the Democratic Party by faulting the Clinton-Gore administration's lack of
progress on health care, gun control and child poverty.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore accused Bradley, who has hammered the vice president for past pro-gun
and anti-abortion views, of taking his cue from the Republican National
Committee. ``Real Democrats don't aid and abet the Republicans,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator Bradley claims he's doing us a service because he doesn't want to
see Democrats bashed in the fall. His proposed solution is to bash Democrats in
the spring,'' Gore added to cheers from a crowd that nearly doubled in the time
between Bradley's speech and Gore's.
</P>
<P>
	   Antioch nurse Martha Henry said she was converted on the spot by Bradley,
``because I believed everything he said.'' But she doubted he had time to
overcome Gore before the March 7 jackpot primary will decide 367 of the 2,170
delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   ``From the crowd in here, I wouldn't think he could, but I hope so,'' said
Henry.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore supporter Roger Henry, a party central committee member from Contra
Costa county, said he understood his wife's instant support for Bradley and his
vision.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm a traditionalist but I want to win. You've got to have the office to
have the power,'' said Mr. Henry.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bradley's vision is what Bill Clinton's was in 1992 and we couldn't get it
done. Gore's vision -- what Bradley calls 'clipping around the edges' -- is
doable.''
</P>
<P>
	   The party favorite, Gore spoke inside the San Jose convention center after a
lineup of officials -- the governor, party chairman Art Torres, Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, Sen. Barbara Boxer -- promoted the vice president's ascension.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nominate Al Gore!'' Boxer ordered some 3,000 convention-goers who are
reliable primary voters.
</P>
<P>
	   After Bradley vacated the podium, Torres called out: ``Godspeed, Senator
Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
	   A woman at the foot of the stage hoisted a large, neon-orange heart that
read: ``Bill Bradley is change.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore has backing here from all but a handful of elected officials and Davis
has pledged the work of his ``entire operation'' in Gore's service. To try and
counter Gore's institutional advantage, Bradley has placed markers on as much as
$3 million worth of TV advertising time for the final two weeks of the
California race, said a knowledgeable ad industry expert.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said Saturday that the Clinton-Gore administration was making ``a
major retreat on campaign finance reform'' with its plans to name Bradley Smith,
an opponent of limits on campaign contributions, to the Federal Election
Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore campaign officials have said Gore strongly favors limits on campaign
contributions, but have declined comment on President Clinton's nomination. No
one was available at the Gore campaign headquarters Saturday night to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   On his way to the meeting, Bradley tried to make his own show of muscle,
leading a march of some 500 supporters through downtown San Jose to the
convention center. The party barred entrance to most of them, allowing Bradley
just 200 or so guest passes.
</P>
<P>
	   The former senator from New Jersey spoke of dreams, saying his goals are
universal health care, the elimination of child poverty, registration of all
handguns, deeper racial understanding, and ``a qualified teacher in every
classroom in every school.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe to the bottom core of my being that the Democratic Party can be
the agent for that kind of dream, for that kind of accomplishment, as long as we
do one thing: we must not settle,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, he said, has a comprehensive education agenda but advocates
incremental health care reform and more limited gun controls.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's speech, delivered with barely a glance at his notes, left Jane
Marcus shaking and in tears. ``He tells me the truth and I believe him,'' said
the Stanford University administrator.
</P>
<P>
	   She watched as, during Bradley's remarks, Gore aides distributed a press
release labeling Bradley a ``special agent of the RNC.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was appalled,'' said Marcus, who said Gore allies want to make Bradley
supporters feel like disloyal Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's dirty tricks. As a Democrat, don't I have as much a right as any
other person in this room to say who I want to be president?''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said Saturday that the Clinton-Gore administration was making ``a
major retreat on campaign finance reform'' with its plans to name Bradley Smith,
an opponent of limits on campaign contributions, to the Federal Election
Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore campaign officials have said Gore strongly favors limits on campaign
contributions, but have declined comment on President Clinton's nomination. No
one was available at the Gore campaign headquarters Saturday night to comment.

	    William Andres
</P>
<P>
	   FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Former Dayton Hudson executive William Andres, who
helped the retailer triple in size during the seven years he ran the company,
died Wednesday after suffering from lymphoma. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
	   From 1976 to 1983, when he was Andres was chief executive officer, Dayton
Hudson grew from 400 stores to more than 1,000 and from $1.9 billion in revenues
to more than $5.6 billion. He was chairman of the board until his retirement in
1985.
</P>
<P>
	   During his tenure, the company bought Mervyn's, a California-based
department store. The company also diversified under his leadership, expanding
such subsidiaries as Target and B. Dalton Bookseller.
</P>
<P>
	   Andres became an executive in 1968 and later was the company's first chief
executive office outside the Dayton family.
Jacqueline Auriol
</P>
<P>
	   PARIS (AP) -- Jacqueline Auriol, France's first female test pilot who set
several world aviation speed records in the 1950s and 1960s, has died, her
family said Saturday. She was 82.
</P>
<P>
	   Auriol, the daughter-in-law of former French President Vincent Auriol, set a
world speed record for female aviators in 1951. On three occasions she was
awarded the Harmon International Trophy by an American president in recognition
of aviation exploits.
Jay Hawkins
</P>
<P>
	   PARIS (AP) -- Screamin' Jay Hawkins, the larger-than-life American blues
singer and pianist who shocked the music world at the dawn of rock with his
crazed shrieking and bizarre stage antics, died Saturday. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
	   Hawkins, from Cleveland, was best known for his song ``I Put a Spell On
You,'' which he recorded on the Okeh label in 1956 and which helped win him cult
status in the United States, Europe and Japan. He planned the tune as a ballad,
but after a night of heavy drinking he took another crack -- screaming, yelling
and groaning -- and never looked back.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of his groans had to be edited out so that ``I Put a Spell On You''
could be played on the radio. Hawkins once said the song, written to woo back a
girlfriend, was at first banned by some radio stations because it supposedly
sounded cannibalistic.
</P>
<P>
	   Hawkins went on to use the same demented style again and again. An
outrageous performer, he used bizarre stage props, often emerging out of coffins
during shows. He would wield rubber snakes and fake tarantulas and wear a boar's
tooth around his neck or a bone clipped to his nose.
George Jackson
</P>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- George Jackson, a former president of Motown Records who
produced the movies of some of Hollywood's leading black actors, has died. He
was 42.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson died in New York on Thursday after suffering a stroke, the Los
Angeles Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   He co-produced the films ``A Thin Line Between Love and Hate'' starring
Martin Lawrence, ``New Jack City'' with Wesley Snipes and ``Krush Groove''
starring Blair Underwood. Other films included ``Jason's Lyric'' and the second
and third installments of the ``House Party'' series featuring the hip-hop duo
Kid N' Play.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In a business that is very self-centered and is very tough to stay in,
George helped everyone, whether he was in competition with them or not,'' said
Doug McHenry, who co-founded Elephant Walk Entertainment with Jackson.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson also co-produced UPN's ``Malcolm &AMP; Eddie'' comedy under the Elephant
Walk banner.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson's most recent effort was creating Urban Box Office Network,
described as a media company for the ``urban mindset.'' UBO will establish a
media lab in Harlem to honor Jackson, McHenry said.
</P>
<P>
	   A Harvard University graduate, Jackson became president and chief executive
of Motown in 1997. He oversaw several acts, including the group 98 Degrees and
the Temptations.
Vicki Moore
</P>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Vicki Moore, a campaigner against cruelty to animals in
Europe, died Feb. 6 of cancer. She was 44.
</P>
<P>
	   Moore came to public attention as an animal-rights campaigner in 1987 when
she purchased a donkey from a Spanish village where it would have been ridden
through the streets until it collapsed. The donkey was taken to an English
sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
	   Moore and her husband established their own group, Fight Against Animal
Cruelty in Europe, and campaigned widely.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1995, Moore was badly gored while videotaping a bull-running ceremony in
Spain in which the animal runs around a plaza with flaming gobs of tar on its
horns.
Guy Waterman
</P>
<P>
	   FRANCONIA, N.H. (AP) -- Guy Waterman, a hiker and author best known for
chronicling the history of New Hampshire's White Mountains, has died. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
	   Waterman's friends retrieved his body from near the summit of Mount
Lafayette on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   His wife and writing partner, Laura Waterman, said he had climbed to an area
near the 5,260-foot summit last week to take his life, something they had
discussed for many years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He could feel his loss of strength,'' she told The Valley News of Lebanon.
``I think he wanted to go while he was still strong, while he could still climb
the mountains.''
</P>
<P>
	   Fish and Game officials said Waterman left his East Corinth, Vt., home Feb.
6, leaving behind notes to his family.
</P>
<P>
	   Waterman's books include ``Wilderness Ethics'' and ``Backwoods Ethics.'' He
is considered one of the first writers to address the need to be responsible
while hiking, said Mike Dickerman, a friend of Waterman.
</P>
<P>
	   Dickerman said Waterman had some ``personal demons,'' and had lost two sons
in mountaineering accidents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He contributed an awful lot to the White Mountains community,'' said Peter
Crane of the Mount Washington Observatory. ``His writings provided a sense of
history and real thoughtfulness and consideration of our role in the woods and
mountains.''
</P>
<P>
	   Waterman and his wife moved to Vermont in 1973. Before then, he had worked
as a jazz pianist in Washington and a speech writer for three presidents.
Lenore Wingard
</P>
<P>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Lenore Kight Wingard, an Olympic swimmer who competed in
front of Adolf Hitler in the 1936 Berlin Games, died Wednesday. She was 88.
</P>
<P>
	   Wingard, once dubbed ``one of the fastest mermaids in the world,'' set world
and U.S. records in freestyle events. She won a gold and a silver medal in the
1932 Olympics in Los Angeles and a bronze in 1936.
</P>
<P>
	   During a 1991 interview, she recalled the tight security in Berlin. At one
point, she needed two hours to get back to her dormitory, forced to take the
subway because soldiers wouldn't let her cross the street.
</P>
<P>
	   In one of her best-known races, she lost the 400-meter freestyle by
one-tenth of a second in the 1932 Olympics. She matched world champion swimmer
Helene Madison stroke for stroke until Madison won with a world-record time of
5:28.5.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Mourn Airline Employees  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- About 3,500 people connected to Alaska Airlines and its
sister company Horizon Airline gathered at a corporate memorial service Saturday
to remember co-workers who died when Flight 261 crashed in the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We gather to celebrate all five brave crew members, heroes all and
consummate heroes who did everything in their power -- everything -- to save
their stricken aircraft and care for their passengers,'' said John Kelly,
chairman and chief executive officer of Alaska Air Group, the parent company of
both airlines.
</P>
<P>
	   All 88 people aboard the Alaska Airlines MD-83 jetliner died when it plunged
into the ocean Jan. 31 off the southern California coast.
</P>
<P>
	   During Saturday's service at the Washington State Trade and Convention
Center, two employees lit candles for each of the five crew members and seven
other vacationing employees who died. Also among the victims were 32 family
members and friends of airline employees.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This loss has brought us all together in a way we could not have
imagined,'' said Captain Mike Swanigan, an Alaska Airlines pilot.
</P>
<P>
	   The corporate memorial service followed a series of private and public
services to remember the victims of the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane was on its way from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to Seattle via San
Francisco when it went down.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Gets Assists From NBA Pals  </HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT LINDLAW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Democratic presidential contender Bill Bradley got
an assist from some old NBA friends Saturday, and told young basketball players
that lessons learned on the court applied to life off it as well.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's unqualified to be a politician: He's honest, he's intelligent, he's
caring, he has a vision, and he can see beyond tomorrow and he can see beyond
himself,'' said Bill Russell, the former Boston Celtics star.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This man right here: Get used to seeing his face. He's going to lead the
country,'' Julius Erving -- ``Dr. J'' of the Philadelphia 76ers -- told a packed
high school gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, wearing a white ``Fremont Tigers'' T-shirt and sweatpants, sat
behind the onetime stars as they delivered their testimonials. Young people sat
on the court, and more students -- and their parents -- filled the bleachers.
</P>
<P>
	   Phil Jackson, now the Los Angeles Lakers coach, recalled his fomer New York
Knicks teammate as a natural leader.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think he's going to be a great leader for this country,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, seeking to reignite his White House campaign, shed his suit and tie
following the California Democratic Party convention in neighboring San Jose to
attend a clinic in east Oakland, a largely black and Hispanic neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
	   Most in Bradley's student audience were too young to recall the former
stars' glory days, if they were alive at the time at all.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley acknowledged as much, saying: ``I don't think these kids realize who
they're in the presence of.''
</P>
<P>
	   The high school gym was festooned with Bradley banners, and a placard was
affixed to one glass backboard. Between speeches from his friends, Bradley
fielded rebounds during a drill for the students.
</P>
<P>
	   The primary here is March 7, about three weeks away, and Bradley trails Gore
by some 40 points in the latest poll of California Democratic voters. Polls in
other states show him losing ground against Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bradley said basketball taught resilience.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Life's full of ups and downs,'' he said. ``You're going to lose, you're
going to win, whether you're a player or a politician, whatever you do.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The real question is, what do you have to bring you back up after you've
gone down?'' he said. ``What is it inside you that makes you realize that
adversity somehow strengthens you?''

<HEADLINE> Airline Makes Unscheduled Landing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) -- A Continental Airlines DC-10 made an
unscheduled landing Saturday in the capital of Newfoundland after a light went
on, indicating the possibility of smoke in the cabin.
</P>
<P>
	   Fires trucks, ambulances and police vehicles were scrambled to the runway
before a Continental Airlines DC-10 touched down safely. There were no reports
of injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A light did go on, but there was no smoke, no fire. It was a
misindication, a false signal. The plane is getting ready to go back into
service,'' said Catherine Stengel, a spokeswoman for the Houston-based airline.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It could have been a blown fuse. They're not sure what caused the light to
go on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane's pilot reportedly asked to land at St. John's Airport, saying an
air-conditioning unit in a cargo hold beneath the cockpit apparently overheated,
sending smoke into the cabin.
</P>
<P>
	   Flight 55 from Paris was originally scheduled to arrive in Newark at 6:15
p.m. but was rescheduled to arrive in Newark later Saturday night.

<HEADLINE> Nine Jets With Tail Glitch Grounded  </HEADLINE>
   By LEON DROUIN KEITH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Airlines temporarily grounded nine more jets Saturday
under a government order to examine tail wings for a problem that may have
caused an Alaska Airlines jet to crash two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Since Thursday, 21 planes have been found to have irregularities with tail
wing jackscrews, the 2-foot-long rods that drive the stabilizers that keep
planes level, the Federal Aviation Administration and airlines said.
</P>
<P>
	   The jackscrew recovered from the submerged wreckage of Alaska Airlines
Flight 261 had damaged threads and metal shavings.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Transportation Safety Bureau has not determined whether
jackscrew damage caused the Jan. 31 crash that killed all 88 people aboard, but
after similar damage was found on other Alaska Airlines jets, the FAA ordered
all airlines to inspect their MD-80s, MD-90s, Boeing 717s and DC-9s -- about
1,200 planes in all.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement Saturday, the FAA said 13 planes had been grounded for
jackscrew problems, though some were back in service. Others were found to have
metal shavings on the jackscrew or other irregularities, such as metallic
residue in screw grease or a lack of lubricant.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The significance of the findings will not be known until a detailed
inspection of the parts can be made,'' the FAA said. ``These are initial reports
and the FAA believes it is premature to draw any conclusions from them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Airlines said even more planes have been grounded than the 13 the FAA
announced.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines spokesman Jack Ware said his company had grounded eight
aircraft, including four on Saturday. The FAA said Alaska Airlines had reported
a total of four planes with problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Similarly, Northwest Airlines reported replacing the jackscrews of three
aircraft, including two Saturday, but the FAA said that airline reported
problems with only one of its aircraft.
</P>
<P>
	   FAA spokesman Eliot Brenner said the agency is looking specifically for
slivers of metal along jackscrews while airline mechanics are reporting anything
unusual they find.
</P>
<P>
	   The FAA has ordered that the inspections be completed by Monday and gave
airlines until Wednesday to report their findings, Brenner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Most airlines said Saturday their companies had completed most of the
required inspections and expected to have the job finished by Sunday morning.
They said that because flights are light this weekend, they do not expect
problems finding room for passengers.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines said six of the eight planes it grounded had metallic dust
or residue in and around jackscrews. That may be a sign of normal wear, the
airline said, but it grounded the planes anyway and notified the FAA and NTSB.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokespeople for Northwest and Delta Air Lines also reported residue on
their jackscrews.
</P>
<P>
	   Northwest had one of its three planes with problems back in the air by
Saturday afternoon, airline spokesman Jon Austin said. Two Delta planes were
back in service after their jackscrews were replaced, and two others should be
back in service Sunday, Delta spokeswoman Peggy Estes said.

<P>
	   The other airlines that had planes with problems included AirTran, with two
aircraft grounded, and American, Continental, TWA and Hawaiian Air, with one
each. AirTran, which was formerly known as ValuJet, and TWA reported the
problems with their planes Saturday, FAA spokesman Brenner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Saturday, the Ventura County medical examiner's office said it had made
42 positive identifications of Flight 261 victims. Office spokeswoman Julie Frey
said she did not know how many more crash victims could be identified.

	   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Tom Landry, the Dallas Cowboys coach who led America's
Team to five Super Bowls in three decades as coach, died today at age 75. Landry
had been under treatment since May for leukemia, but doctors said his condition
worsened in recent days. His teams won 13 divisional titles and had 20 straight
winning seasons. He's third on the NFL's career victory list with a 270-178-6

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Airlines temporarily grounded nine more jets today under
a government order to examine tail wings for a problem that may have caused an
Alaska Airlines jet to crash two weeks ago. Since Thursday, 21 planes have been
found to have irregularities with tail wing jackscrews, the 2-foot-long rods
that drive the stabilizers that keep planes level, the Federal Aviation
Administration and airlines said. The jackscrew recovered from the submerged

<HEADLINE> Dearth in Nominees for Image Awards  </HEADLINE>
    By CADONNA M. PEYTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- A shortage of minority characters in television
made it difficult for organizers of the NAACP's annual Image Awards to select
nominees in the TV categories this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has
confronted the networks for months about the lack of minority characters.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue of minorities in the entertainment industry came to a boil in July
when the NAACP and a coalition of Hispanic groups condemned a near-total lack of
minority characters in fall series. The groups threatened lawsuits and boycotts.
</P>
<P>
	   But within the past months, NAACP officials met with TV network executives,
who promised to work toward enhancing diversity on their shows.
</P>
<P>
	   In the television categories, CBS had 18 nominations. ABC was next with 15,
followed by HBO with 14, Warner Bros. with 12 and NBC with 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Although CBS had the most nominations, critics say both CBS and Fox are not
putting enough minorities to work in television. Both networks recently
announced that they will have more minority characters this fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Agreements by Fox and CBS are similar to those signed by NBC and ABC last
month, focusing on changes in minority representation through the companies --
both on-screen and off.
</P>
<P>
	   The 31st NAACP Image Awards, which honors blacks in film, television, music
and literature, took place Friday and Saturday at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, CBS won for outstanding drama series for "Touched by an Angel,"
co-starring Della Reese. Fox took the outstanding variety series or special for
"1999 Essence Awards." Civil rights heroine, Rosa Parks, won for supporting
acress in a drama series for her appearance on "Touched by an Angel."
</P>
<P>
	   Angela Bassett won outstanding supporting actress in the motion picture,
"Music of the Heart." Halle Berry won outstanding actress in a television movie,
mini-series or dramatic special for the lead role in "Introducing Dorothy
Dandridge," an HBO movie about the first black woman nominated for an Academy
Award as best actress. Berry also won a Golden Globe for her role.
</P>
<P>
	   The Image Awards show is scheduled to air April 6 on Fox.

today. Tracy Zhao, 30, arrived at LaGuardia Airport, where she was met by her
mother and the cheers of supporters. Zhao was among at least 50 Falun Gong

the demonstrators before putting them in vans and driving them away. The Chinese

<HEADLINE> Council Rules Against Wash. Paper  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) -- A new privately funded council created to help handle
complaints against media outlets acted on its first formal complaint Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Washington News Council voted 9-6 to endorse an unsuccessful city
council candidate's contention that a newspaper editorial in The Olympian
unfairly attacked his character and damaged his reputation last fall.
</P>
<P>
	   The council's conclusion carries no legal weight. The only penalty is
publicity about the decision.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm just happy the organization exists,'' Bernie Friedman said after the
council sided with him. ``People now have a place to go when The Olympian or
other media defame people.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Olympian declined to participate in the council's process.
</P>
<P>
	   Executive Editor Vickie Kilgore wrote in an opinion-page column published
Saturday: ``This is a page of opinion, including ours. They are often bold,
sometimes unpopular. But we are exercising our right to express them, and we
cannot let ourselves be intimidated in that.''
</P>
<P>
	   The council has received only one formal complaint, which requires a waiver
of the right to sue. Friedman, a lawyer, said pursuing a defamation lawsuit was
a risk not worth the expense.

<HEADLINE> McCain Revs Up Campaign in S.C.  </HEADLINE>
   By LEIGH STROPE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DARLINGTON, S.C. (AP) -- John McCain hit 100 mph in a spin around
Darlington's famed speedway Saturday and George W. Bush told people in Columbia
he's ``a tough competitor'' and hinted that he's found a policy mistake by the
McCain campaign to use against him in next week's debate.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain kept his campaign in high gear with several town meetings and other
stops the rest of the weekend. Bush made a couple of campaign stops in the
state, before heading back to Austin to spend some time with family, returning
to the campaign trail on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   As Bush was telling an audience at a Columbia restaurant that ``my faith
allowed me to handle a short-term adversity,'' McCain was hopping behind the
wheel of a blue Pontiac Grand Prix NASCAR's Darlington Raceway for a few turns
around the track Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The most important news of the day is I went over 100 miles an hour,''
McCain said. ``I hope I do a better job driving this car than I did on my last
mission.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was a Vietnam POW after his plane was shot down over Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
	   The candidate jumped in the car wearing a suit and tie -- but not a helmet
-- and had his wife Cindy in the passenger seat. He gave a thumbs-up to track
officials and reporters before flooring the gas pedal, kicking up dust in his
wake. He took two laps around the track, stopping once for photographers, and
then emerged from the car with a huge grin.
</P>
<P>
	   The Darlington track has a rich tradition in South Carolina politics. Bob
Dole in 1995 explored the early stages of his presidential bid here and other
candidates have made the mandatory campaign stop at Darlington. The track is in
the heart of tobacco country, where McCain's sponsorship of failed legislation
to raise taxes on tobacco has been a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier the Arizona senator walked through a neighborhood in nearby
Florence, knocking on doors and asking for votes. He surprised Steve Coker, who
answered his door with his children peering from behind him, hiding from the
television cameras.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He'll let all his work show,'' Coker said of McCain. ``We know all about
the Keating Five, we know he's divorced, we're not guessing about his drug
use.''
</P>
<P>
	   Both campaigns on Saturday were still preoccupied with campaign tactics,
trading attacks on everything from push polling to rude telephone calls to
fund-raising. Bush told reporters Saturday that his campaign has hearing from
supporters that they're getting calls from someone claiming to be with the Bush
campaign, who starts ``trashmouthing'' the person answering the phone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I warn the people of South Carolina, Republicans, if you get a phone call
from some voice purporting to be me that is rude, just ignore it,'' Bush said.
``I can assure you our people are not calling to make it hard for me to win the
election.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush did not blame the calls on McCain. Earlier in the week, McCain demanded
that the Bush campaign stop calling voters and misleading them about his record
after a woman complained her 14-year-old son received such a call. The woman
didn't know if the Bush campaign had made the call.
</P>
<P>
	   State Sen. Mike Fair of Greenville told Bush at Seawell's Restaurant in
Columbia that the Bush campaign ``hasn't even hit (McCain's) soft spots.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm going to,'' Bush said in a conversation picked up by boom mikes
overhead. ``But I'm not going to do it on TV.''
</P>
<P>
	   Campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer said Bush was referring to ``a major policy
blunder McCain made this week'' and hinting that he would bring it in Tuesday
night's debate.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush South Carolina spokesman Tucker Eskew said Bush was not referring to
any change in television advertising strategy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator McCain had hoped his olive branch would be taken up by Governor
Bush, but it appears by Governor Bush's own comments he intends to continue his
push polling and other negative tactics,'' said McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky,
who said he didn't know what policy area the Bush people were referring to.
``That's too bad. The people of South Carolina deserve better.''
</P>
<P>
	   A Newsweek poll out Saturday showed the race was a dead heat, with Bush
doing better among Republicans and McCain better among independents.
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire, McCain rode his strong support from both groups to an
18-point victory. Bush said Saturday that his faith sustained him after his loss
there. But he told the crowd of about 100 at Seawell's Restaurant that he's wary
of people in public office who say: ``Vote for me, I'm more religious than my
neighbor.'''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Faith, to me, is strength. It puts life in perspective. I recognize that
I'm a humble sinner and I've sought redemption, and I recognize that I'm no
better than anybody else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   After his visit to the capital city of Columbia, Bush traveled to Orangeburg
for a speech and question-and-answer session before a crowd of more than a
thousand. Then he flew back to Texas to spend Sunday with his family. Bush
planned to spend the rest of the week in South Carolina after his return on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush campaign was also looking ahead to future primaries. In California,
Bush is launching his ad campaign with the positive ``reformer with results''
spot, a seven-figure buy running for the next couple weeks in large media
markets such as Los Angeles and in heavily Republican areas, including
Bakersfield and San Diego. The McCain campaign has said it will spend less than
the $12.5 million allowed by state law and expects to be outspent 2-to-1 by
Bush.

<HEADLINE> China Considers Armed Tax Police  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China is considering setting up a special armed police force
to protect tax collectors and help curb rampant tax evasion, a state-run
newspaper said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1993, more than 20 tax officials have been killed and hundreds
injured, with violence mainly occurring in rural areas where farmers are often
heavily taxed. Tax evasion also is rampant, with more than $3.6 billion in back
taxes owed at the end of last year, the China Daily said in its Business Weekly
edition.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper said the State Administration of Taxation, China's tax
watchdog, is in talks with government ministries, including the national police,
about how to staff a tax police force. The State Council, China's cabinet, also
is considering setting up special tax courts and tax procurates, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics of the idea say such a force might be ineffective against
state-owned firms -- the biggest tax evaders -- because they have powerful
official connections. Some also fear that forming a tax police could split
China's law enforcement system, the Business Weekly reported.
</P>
<P>
	   No timetable has been set for establishing the force, Lu Renfa, a vice
minister of taxation, was quoted as saying.

	    Tom Landry
</P>
<P>
	   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Tom Landry, the Dallas Cowboys coach who led America's
Team to five Super Bowls and was famous for pacing the sidelines in a business
suit and felt hat, died Saturday. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
	   Landry had been undergoing treatment since May for acute myelogenous
leukemia.
</P>
<P>
	   Baylor University Medical Center issued a news release on behalf of Landry's
family, saying, ``He will never be forgotten by all of us whose lives he has
touched so deeply.''
</P>
<P>
	   Landry, who coached the Cowboys for their first 29 years, won two Super
Bowls with star quarterback Roger Staubach. His 270 victories are more than any
NFL coach except Don Shula and George Halas.
</P>
<P>
	   Landry made his mark through innovations in offense and defense and
considered them his greatest contribution to the game. His legacy continued
through the coaches he trained, including Atlanta's Dan Reeves and former New
Orleans coach Mike Ditka.
</P>
<P>
	   In Landry's first season, 1960, the expansion Cowboys went 0-11-1. He didn't
have a winning season until his seventh year. But that began a streak of 20
consecutive winning seasons, 13 division titles and five Super Bowl appearances.
</P>
<P>
	   Landry was fired by Jerry Jones the day he bought the team in February 1989
after three straight losing seasons. His final record was 270-178-6.
</P>
<P>
	   When Landry left, he was as much a symbol of the Cowboys as the star on
their helmets.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the whole Cowboys image came from him,'' said Staubach, who
introduced Landry at his Hall of Fame enshrinement in 1990, just as Landry had
done for him in 1985. ``I think Tom will always make the Dallas Cowboys more
than a football team.''
</P>
<P>
	   Landry was a college star at the University of Texas and a defensive back
for the New York Giants in one of the innovative defenses of the early 1950s. At
29, he became a player-coach in charge of defense, and his new systems became
such successes that Landry had to devise offenses to counter them.

9 Jets Grounded After Inspections
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Nine more jets were grounded today after a government
order forced airlines to inspect their fleets for tail wing problems that may
have been responsible for the Alaskan Airlines crash two weeks ago. Since
Thursday, 21 planes have been found to have irregularities with tail wing
jackscrews, the 2-foot-long rods that drive the stabilizers that keep planes
level. The National Transportation Safety Bureau has not determined whether
jackscrew damage caused the Jan. 31 crash that killed all 88 people aboard, but
after similar damage was found on other Alaska Airlines jets, the FAA ordered
all airlines to inspect their MD-80s, MD-90s, Boeing 717s and DC-9s -- about
1,200 planes in all.

Reform Party Names Choate Chairman
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- After a hostile showdown local police threatened to
break up, allies of Ross Perot today ousted Reform Party chairman Jack Gargan
and replaced him with Pat Choate. Choate was the Texas billioniare's running

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Newsweek poll released today shows Republican
presidential hopefuls John McCain and George W. Bush locked in a dead heat in a
campaign to win the South Carolina primary in a week. The Texas governor was
supported by 43 percent and McCain, a senator from Arizona, was supported by 40
percent in the poll conducted Wednesday through Friday. The poll supported the
McCain camp's belief that it will need a heavy turnout of independents to win in
the state. McCain got the backing of 55 percent of independents in the poll,
while Bush was backed by 53 percent of Republicans.

China Considers Armed Tax Police
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   BEIJING (AP) -- China is considering setting up a special armed police force
to protect tax collectors and help curb rampant tax evasion, a state-run
newspaper said Sunday. Since 1993, more than 20 tax officials have been killed
and hundreds injured, with violence mainly occurring in rural areas where
farmers are often heavily taxed. Tax evasion also is rampant, with more than
$3.6 billion in back taxes owed at the end of last year, the China Daily said in
its Business Weekly edition.

Witness: 24 Die in Somali Fighting
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) -- At least 24 people were killed and another 45
wounded in interclan fighting in southwestern Somalia, a witness said Saturday.
Fighting in Dhobley, 340 miles southwest of the capital, Mogadishu, erupted
during the night when 150 subclan fighters attacked the town, the witness said.
The witness, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the casualties included
noncombatants and fighters from both sides of the Ogaden clan. Somalia has had
no central government since late dictator Mohammed Siad Barre was ousted by a
coalition of rebels. After Siad Barre's ouster, the rebels turned against each
other and the country disintegrated into fiefdoms controlled by clan militias.

	   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Tom Landry, the Dallas Cowboys coach who led America's
Team to five Super Bowls in three decades as coach, died today at age 75. Landry
had been under treatment since May for leukemia, but doctors said his condition
worsened in recent days. His teams won 13 divisional titles and had 20 straight
winning seasons. He's third on the NFL's career victory list with a 270-178-6

Blackhawks Beat Thrashers 4-3
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Jocelyn Thibault made 37 saves and Kevin Dean banged in a
second-chance rebound with nine seconds left in the second period as the Chicago
Blackhawks defeated Atlanta 4-3 today and extended the Thrashers' winless streak
to 13. Dean McAmmond, Tony Amonte and Steve Sullivan also scored for the
Blackhawks, while Michael Nylander added three assists. After holding a
20-minute, closed-door meeting the previous night following a 3-0 loss to San
Jose, the Thrashers played a much more competitive game. They snapped a
five-period scoreless stretch, twice rebounding from one-goal deficits.

<HEADLINE> Canadiens 5, Senators 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MONTREAL (AP) -- Turner Stevenson's tie-breaking goal midway through the
third period lifted the Montreal Canadiens to a 5-4 victory over the Ottawa
Senators on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Patrick Poulin, Sergei Zholtok, Patrice Brisebois and Benoit Brunet also
scored for Montreal, which snapped a two-game losing skid and beat Ottawa for
the first time in four tries this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Marian Hossa, Radek Bonk, Daniel Alfredsson and Vaclav Prospal scored for
Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
	   Stevenson scored on a rebound of Trevor Linden's shot at 7:23, just 30
seconds after Prospal tied it 4-4 on a wrist shot.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Hackett made 26 saves for the Canadiens, who were outshot 30-27.
</P>
<P>
	   Brunet's goal at 3:13 of the third gave Montreal a 4-3 lead after Ottawa
rallied from a pair of two-goal deficits in the second.
</P>
<P>
	   Hossa was credited with his 19th of the season when his pass went in off
Brisebois' skate to make it 3-2 at 9:35. Alfredsson tied it on a short-handed
breakaway at 15:46.
</P>
<P>
	   Poulin and Zholtok scored in a 66-second span late in the first to give
Montreal a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Bonk and Brisebois traded power-play goals early in the second.
</P>
<P>
	   Canadiens defenseman Vladimir Malakhov was booed heavily by the crowd when
he stepped on the ice two minutes into the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Malakhov missed the first 53 games of the season with a knee injury and was
suspended by the team earlier this week after he went skiing during the All-Star
break.
</P>
<P>
	   Dainius Zubrus had two assists for Montreal, and has 10 points in his last
10 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Hossa has five points in his last four games, while Bonk and Alfredsson have
five in their last five games.

<HEADLINE> No. 6 Mich. St. 61, Wisconsin 44  </HEADLINE>
    By GREG BEACHAM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Morris Peterson had 18 points and 10 rebounds as No. 6
Michigan State kept a share of the Big Ten lead with a 61-44 victory over
Wisconsin on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Spartans (18-6, 8-2 Big Ten) never trailed and never were really
threatened by the Badgers, who lost for the third time in four games.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan State recovered from its 70-67 loss at Purdue on Tuesday night and
exacted revenge for its 66-51 loss at Wisconsin last season, the Spartans' only
conference defeat in the 1998-99 campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan State's win and Ohio State's 88-75 victory over Penn State set up a
showdown for the Big Ten lead Tuesday night when the No. 5 Buckeyes visit the
Spartans in East Lansing. Each team has two conference losses.
</P>
<P>
	   Against the undersized Badgers (12-11, 4-7), Michigan State built a 35-20
lead with a 13-2 run in the closing minutes of the first half. Peterson, who had
just five points in the Spartans' loss at Purdue, had 13 first-half points and
scored five straight shortly after halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Jerry Richardson dunked an alley-oop pass from Mateen Cleaves that gave
Michigan State a 45-28 lead with 12 minutes to play. The lead stretched to 23
points moments later as the Spartans cruised to the victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan State outrebounded Wisconsin 51-24 and outran the Badgers, who have
lost three of their last five home games while sinking into a tie for eighth in
the conference.
</P>
<P>
	   A.J. Granger had 11 points and 11 rebounds for Michigan State, which won
even though Cleaves struggled in a 2-of-10 shooting performance.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Vershaw, Wisconsin's leading scorer, went 1-for-10 from the field.
Maurice Linton had 10 points to lead Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
	   The Badgers could have used some help from Ron Dayne, who got a standing
ovation when he and his Heisman Trophy made a halftime appearance at center
court.
</P>
<P>
	   A physical game occasionally brought bad feelings between the teams to the
surface. Cleaves and Vershaw had to be separated after an argument with three
minutes to play, and at least two minor skirmishes erupted in the stands.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wisconsin student section's chants of "Alcoholic" -- a reference to
Cleaves' troubles with the law over allegedly stealing a bottle of beer in April
-- were nearly drowned out by chants of "All-American" from the sizable Michigan
State cheering section in the upper deck of the Kohl Center.

<HEADLINE> Media Execs Debate Ethics in D.C.  </HEADLINE>
    By GARRETT THEROLF Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Media executives at a National Press Club panel grappled
Saturday with the difficulty of delivering accurate news to a skeptical public
while at the same time coping with the competitive pressures of media outlets
moving at ever-faster speeds.
</P>
<P>
	   "News is everywhere," said Louis D. Boccardi, president and CEO of The
Associated Press. "The public just can't get away from it."
</P>
<P>
	   He noted that surveys often show the public saying they were overloaded with
news coverage, but at the same time "the audience figures were just phenomenal"
for some of those same stories.
</P>
<P>
	   Other members of the 12-member panel on media ethics emphasized that many of
the problems they face are derived from the fact that the ways journalists use
to get this massive amount of news to their audience are quicker, and sometimes
hastier, than more traditional mediums of the past.
</P>
<P>
	   Veteran Washington Post political reporter David Broder said the speed with
which the new media moves creates a "problem for our credibility and trust."
</P>
<P>
	   Broder said the quick pace of developing stories with the advent of cable
television news and the resulting 24-hour news cycle often provides the public
with unchecked or inaccurate stories. He said he has not only seen his stories
go unedited onto the Post's Web site, but has seen similar situations involving
live television reports.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have been on the set ... when some 12-year old rushes a piece of copy 
1/8to the anchor people 3/8, they read it (on the air) and at the next
commercial break, having some sense of judgment and perspective, one or the
other will say 'where the hell did that come from.'
</P>
<P>
	   "But by now its out there in the ether," Broder said.
</P>
<P>
	   The annual National Roundtable was sponsored by the Scripps Howard
Foundation. It was carried live by C-SPAN and moderated by C-SPAN founder Brian
P. Lamb.

<HEADLINE> 11 Jets With Tail Glitch Grounded  </HEADLINE>
   By LEON DROUIN KEITH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Airlines temporarily grounded 11 more jets Saturday
under a government order to examine tail wings for a problem that may have
caused an Alaska Airlines jet to crash two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Since Thursday, at least 21 planes have been found to have irregularities
with tail wing jackscrews, the 2-foot-long rods that drive the stabilizers that
keep planes level, according to numbers from the Federal Aviation Administration
and airlines.
</P>
<P>
	   The jackscrew recovered from the submerged wreckage of Alaska Airlines
Flight 261 had damaged threads and metal shavings.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Transportation Safety Bureau has not determined whether
jackscrew damage caused the Jan. 31 crash that killed all 88 people aboard, but
after similar damage was found on other Alaska Airlines jets, the FAA ordered
all airlines to inspect their MD-80s, MD-90s, Boeing 717s and DC-9s -- about
1,200 planes in all.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement Saturday, the FAA said 13 planes had been grounded for
jackscrew problems, though some were back in service. Others were found to have
metal shavings on the jackscrew or other irregularities, such as metallic
residue in screw grease or a lack of lubricant.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The significance of the findings will not be known until a detailed
inspection of the parts can be made,'' the FAA said. ``These are initial reports
and the FAA believes it is premature to draw any conclusions from them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Airlines said even more planes have been grounded than the 13 the FAA
announced.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines spokesman Jack Ware said his company had grounded eight
aircraft, including four on Saturday. The FAA said Alaska Airlines had reported
a total of four planes with problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Similarly, Northwest Airlines reported replacing the jackscrews of three
aircraft, including two Saturday, but the FAA said that airline reported
problems with only one of its aircraft.
</P>
<P>
	   FAA spokesman Eliot Brenner said the agency is looking specifically for
slivers of metal along jackscrews while airline mechanics are reporting anything
unusual they find.
</P>
<P>
	   The FAA has ordered that the inspections be completed by Monday and gave
airlines until Wednesday to report their findings, Brenner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Most airlines said Saturday their companies had completed most of the
required inspections and expected to have the job finished by Sunday morning.
They said that because flights are light this weekend, they do not expect
problems finding room for passengers.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines said six of the eight planes it grounded had metallic dust
or residue in and around jackscrews. That may be a sign of normal wear, the
airline said, but it grounded the planes anyway and notified the FAA and NTSB.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokespeople for Northwest and Delta Air Lines also reported residue on
jackscrews.
</P>
<P>
	   Northwest had one of its three planes with problems back in the air by
Saturday afternoon, airline spokesman Jon Austin said. Two Delta planes were
back in service after their jackscrews were replaced, and two others with
problems discovered Saturday should be back in service Sunday, Delta spokeswoman
Peggy Estes said.
</P>
<P>
	   The other airlines that had planes with problems included AirTran, with two
aircraft grounded, and American, Continental, TWA and Hawaiian Air, with one
each. AirTran, which was formerly known as ValuJet, and TWA reported the
problems with their planes Saturday, FAA spokesman Brenner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Saturday, the Ventura County medical examiner's office said it had made
42 positive identifications of Flight 261 victims. Office spokeswoman Julie Frey
said she did not know how many more crash victims could be identified.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Benefits Bill Criticized  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRANDE PRAIRIE, Alberta (AP) -- Reform Leader Preston Manning called the
federal government's proposed legislation giving same-sex couples the same
benefits as heterosexual couples a Liberal smokescreen.
</P>
<P>
	   Manning said that while he supports the traditional definition of marriage
as the basis for family life and the provision of government benefits, there may
be exceptions.
</P>
<P>
	   ''(But) these relationships should not be based on sexual preference, they
should be based on a relationship of dependency,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal Justice Minister Anne McLellan introduced a bill Friday that would
extend legal benefits to gay and lesbian couples, such as being able to collect
survivor benefits under the Canada Pension Plan.
</P>
<P>
	   While the proposal avoided the issue of equating same-sex marriages with
heterosexual marriages, gay and lesbian advocates praised the proposal for
aiming to give same-sex couples recognition under the law.
</P>
<P>
	   Manning said his party will debate the same-sex bill but ``we have no
intention of letting up on that Human Resources Development scandal at all.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a diversion by the federal Liberals to try to take attention off this
scandal in Human Resources Development,'' Manning said after a meeting Saturday
in northern Alberta to promote the fledgling Canadian Alliance party.
</P>
<P>
	   For weeks, Manning and his caucus have blasted Liberal Human Resources
Minister Jane Stewart over millions of dollars in job creation grants.
</P>
<P>
	   An audit made public last month uncovered serious problems among grants in
seven programs, including job creation, literacy training and help for the
disabled and aboriginals. There were missing or incomplete documents and
insufficient monitoring.
</P>
<P>
	   Reform is calling for Stewart's resignation and a full accounting of where
the money has gone.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Coach Tom Landry Dies  </HEADLINE>
    By JAIME ARON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Tom Landry, the Dallas Cowboys coach who led America's
Team to five Super Bowls and was famous for pacing the sidelines for three
decades wearing a stone face, business suit and felt hat, died Saturday. He was
75.
</P>
<P>
	   Landry had been undergoing treatment since May for acute myelogenous
leukemia. He died at Baylor University Medical Center about 6 p.m. CST,
surrounded by his family.
</P>
<P>
	   Landry, who coached the Cowboys for their first 29 years, won two Super
Bowls with star quarterback Roger Staubach. His 270 victories are more than any
NFL coach except Don Shula and George Halas.
</P>
<P>
	   Commissioner Paul Tagliabue praised Landry as "the NFL at its best."
</P>
<P>
	   "He will always rank as one of the all-time great coaches and as an
architect of one of the most successful teams in sports history," he said. "He
will be remembered for many special reasons, including his record as a coach,
the innovations he brought to our game, and the personal integrity he
displayed."
</P>
<P>
	   Landry considered those innovations his greatest contribution. His legacy
continued through the coaches he produced, including Atlanta's Dan Reeves and
former New Orleans coach Mike Ditka.
</P>
<P>
	   "He shaped my philosophy on everything," Reeves said Saturday night. "I
followed his philosophy on football and how he handled himself on and off the
field. He was a tremendous influence on me."
</P>
<P>
	   Owner Jerry Jones, who fired Landry the day he bought the team in 1989
following three straight losing seasons, on Saturday night described him as "the
single most important figure in the history of this franchise."
</P>
<P>
	   In Landry's first season, 1960, the expansion Cowboys went 0-11-1. He didn't
have a winning season until his seventh. But that began a streak of 20
consecutive winning seasons, 13 division titles and five Super Bowl appearances.
</P>
<P>
	   His final record was 270-178-6, a .601 winning percentage. And when he left,
he was as much a symbol of the Cowboys as the star on their helmets.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the whole Cowboys image came from him," said Staubach, who
introduced Landry at his Hall of Fame enshrinement in 1990, just as Landry had
done for him in '85. "I think Tom will always make the Dallas Cowboys more than
a football team."
</P>
<P>
	   Landry was a star at the University of Texas, then a defensive back for the
New York Giants in one of the innovative defenses of the early '50s -- "The
Umbrella," the first to put four backs deep to counter the passing game.
</P>
<P>
	   At 29, he became a player-coach in charge of the defense, a job now known as
the defensive coordinator. He changed the front seven of the Umbrella from a 5-2
to a 4-3, essentially creating the middle linebacker position for Sam Huff. The
system became such a success that Landry later had to devise the multiple
offense to counter it. Both alignments remain standards -- from Pee Wee to the
pros.
</P>
<P>
	   General manager Tex Schramm was still trying to get an NFL franchise in
Dallas when he introduced Landry as the team's first coach. Their agreement was
that Schramm would run the business side and Landry would be in charge of
football.
</P>
<P>
	   A dynasty was formed through the unlikely pairing of the straight-laced,
religious Landry and Schramm, the flashy showman whose promotional flair
included bringing scantily clad cheerleaders to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were totally different," Schramm said. "We were never close socially,
but we got along very well because he had his domain and we each knew where the
lines were. I respected him, he respected me and things worked perfectly."
</P>
<P>
	   Landry's Xs and Os betrayed his bland persona. He thrived on doing things
differently, especially if he could mix in deception.
</P>
<P>
	   He created the "Flex" defense that placed one tackle a half-yard behind the
other and he used gadget plays on offense, notably the quarterback throwback and
the halfback pass.
</P>
<P>
	   His offensive line also had a gimmick -- it would often crouch down, raise
up and then reset, a style often imitated by kids on playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Landry was emotionless on the sidelines and in the locker room, even in the
bitter cold of the "Ice Bowl." He avoided getting close to his players for fear
it would interfere with personnel decisions, and he ruled through a stare known
as "The Look."
</P>
<P>
	   Former running back Walt Garrison summed it up best when he was asked if he
ever saw Landry smile.
</P>
<P>
	   "No," Garrison said, "but I was only there nine years."
</P>
<P>
	   Landry worked differently with his assistant coaches, many of whom became
NFL head coaches. The contrast was stunning for those who had played for him.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you played for him, he's the boss," said Ditka, a tight end for four
years and an assistant under Landry for nine. "When I coached for him, he was
the boss, too, but when you played for him, there was a fear in there."
</P>
<P>
	   Landry spent his final years devoted to business endeavors and Christian
organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1989, the city of Dallas held a "Hats Off to Tom Landry Day," which
included a parade that drew 100,000 people. The guest of honor cried and called
it the "most exciting and meaningful" day in his life.
</P>
<P>
	   He stayed away from football except for his 1990 Hall of Fame induction and
his 1993 induction into the team's Ring of Honor at Texas Stadium. Instead of a
jersey number, a tiny hat hangs next to his name and the years "1960-88."
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas Wade Landry was born Sept. 11, 1924, in Mission, Texas. After one
semester of college, he joined the Army Air Corps and spent two years as a
bomber pilot in World War II. Although his older brother Robert died flying a
B-17, Tom flew 30 combat missions and survived one crash landing.
</P>
<P>
	   His tough exterior was necessary in his early days in Dallas. Public
criticism was peaking after his fourth season, 1963. Landry had a 13-38-3 record
and one year left on his original contract. Owner Clint Murchison showed his
support with a 10-year extension.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cowboys played host to a playoff game for the first time on Jan. 1,
1967. Green Bay jumped ahead 14-0, but quarterback Don Meredith rallied the
Cowboys within 34-27. Dallas drove to the Packers' 2 in the final minutes, but
failed to score the game-tying touchdown. Green Bay went on to win the first
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Landry's first postseason victory came the following season in Cleveland,
setting up a rematch against the Packers -- only this time in Green Bay, in the
game remembered as the "Ice Bowl."
</P>
<P>
	   Playing in a wind chill that dropped to 40 below, the Cowboys again trailed
14-0, then led 17-14. Bart Starr's touchdown on a quarterback sneak with 13
seconds left gave the Packers a 21-17 victory. Again, they went on to win the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can't believe that call, the sneak," said Landry, who wore a long,
fur-lined coat and matching fur hunter's cap borrowed from one of the team's
minority owners. "It wasn't a good call. But now, it's a great call."
</P>
<P>
	   Fans lashed out at Landry's inability to win big games, citing his lack of
emotion on the sidelines. They wanted him to be more like Packers coach Vince
Lombardi, whose bombastic style Landry had seen with the Giants, where Landry
was the defensive assistant and Lombardi the offensive assistant. Landry, who
modeled himself after Paul Brown, couldn't be someone he wasn't.
</P>
<P>
	   Cleveland knocked Dallas out of the next two playoffs, then the Cowboys lost
to Baltimore in the 1971 Super Bowl on a field goal by Jim O'Brien in the final
seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cowboys got tagged as "Next Year's Champions," for coming up short of a
title.
</P>
<P>
	   But the following year, with Staubach at quarterback, Dallas returned to the
Super Bowl and beat Miami 24-3. Players hoisted him onto their shoulders and,
finally, there were some cracks in the stone facade.
</P>
<P>
	   "I still see that image of him being carried off the field," Staubach said.
"I think that was a big deal to him, the best in his life. Seeing that smile on
his face showed how happy he was to finally get over that hump."	   After losing
in the Super Bowl following the 1975 season with a team Landry called his
favorite, he reached the top again in 1977, Tony Dorsett's rookie year. The
Cowboys beat Denver 27-10 in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Things would never be the same again. Dallas lost to Pittsburgh in the next
Super Bowl, then was beaten in the NFC Championship in the 1980, '81 and '82
seasons. The '81 season is best remembered for San Francisco's Dwight Clark
making "The Catch."
</P>
<P>
	   A playoff shutout at home in 1985 was followed by a losing season in '86,
Landry's first since 1964. A combination of bad draft picks and poor personnel
decisions sunk the team, and Dallas went 3-13 in his final season.
</P>
<P>
	   "People will forget me quick," Landry said when he was fired.
</P>
<P>
	   Landry is survived by Alicia Landry, his wife of 50 years; a son, Tom Jr.;
and a daughter, Kitty Phillips. Another daughter, Lisa Childress, died of cancer
in 1995.

<HEADLINE> No. 17 Iowa St. 87, Nebraska 65  </HEADLINE>
    By CHUCK SCHOFFNER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Iowa State's Marcus Fizer was almost perfect against
Nebraska. So was his team.
</P>
<P>
	   Fizer made all but one of his shots in scoring 23 points and No. 17 Iowa
State blew away Nebraska with a huge second-half run in an 87-65 victory
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Iowa State (21-3 overall, 9-1 Big 12) built an early 15-point lead, faltered
slightly and fell behind, then regrouped and broke it open to stay tied with
Oklahoma State for first place in the conference.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was a game that worried me," Iowa State coach Larry Eustachy said.
"They are a very talented team and were capable of coming in here and beating
us.
</P>
<P>
	   "I always say it's tough to keep coming out and throwing your A game out
there for 30-something games. I'm really pleased with the second half."
</P>
<P>
	   Nebraska (10-13, 3-7) lost for the fourth time in five games and is 0-5 on
the road in the Big 12. The Cornhuskers have been outscored in those games by an
average of 19 points.
</P>
<P>
	   They were close for a while in this one, however, trailing by just three
early in the second half. Then Iowa State kicked into a high gear and outscored
the Cornhuskers 29-5 over the next six minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm pretty sure their coach came down on them in the locker room just by
the way they came out and pressured us and said hey, these guys shouldn't be
playing with us at home," Nebraska's Rodney Fields said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We didn't sustain the pressure, kind of broke down a little, one thing led
to another and before you know, we were down by double digits."
</P>
<P>
	   The Cyclones finished their run with 17 straight points to open a 70-43
lead, a burst that featured two sensational fast breaks in a 31-second span.
Jamaal Tinsley fed Fizer for a two-handed dunk to finish the first one and
Tinsley hit Stevie Johnson for a layup on the second one.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Nurse hit two 3-pointers and scored nine points during the run. He
finished with 19. Fizer had eight points and finished 9-for-10 from the field.
His only miss was an attempted tip-in, which he followed with a tip that went
in.
</P>
<P>
	   He sat out the last 11 minutes, leaving with Iowa State ahead 72-45.
</P>
<P>
	   "Fizer is just a tremendous player in all aspects," Nebraska coach Danny Nee
said. "Each year that I've seen him, the man just improves. Right now he is
playing at an MVP-type level."
</P>
<P>
	   Brandon Hawkins' high arching jumper in the lane gave Iowa State its biggest
lead, 82-51, with 7:18 left. Hawkins scored 10 points and Kantrail Horton had
13.
</P>
<P>
	   Larry Florence led Nebraska with 16 points, Danny Walker scored 11 and
Steffon Bradford 10. Nebraska committed 22 turnovers, 13 on Iowa State steals.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had to limit their shots in the second half," Fizer said. "They shot 50
percent in the first half and we knew we had to come back and play better
defense and rebound better to win."
</P>
<P>
	   Iowa State bolted to an 18-3 lead as Horton scored seven points and Nebraska
missed nine of its first 10 shots. But the Cornhuskers settled down and came
back with a 21-5 run that ended with 3-pointers by Fields, Walker and Louis
Truscott for a 26-25 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Nebraska led 30-28 before Iowa State finished the half with a 10-4 run to go
up 38-34. It was 41-38 when Nurse hit a 3-pointer to start the decisive burst
and Nebraska came unglued.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cornhuskers went 11 possessions without scoring during one stretch,
missing four shots and committing seven turnovers.
</P>
<P>
	   "The early start was fantastic," Eustachy said. "The last 10 minutes of the
first half were very poor by our team, then we had a nice second half. What
happened was we got a little complacent. We didn't play as hard as the opponent
and the opponent had a lot to do with it."

<P>
    ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Pavol Demitra scored a career-high three goals in the St.
Louis Blues' 6-3 victory over the Anaheim Mighty Ducks on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Demitra's goals helped St. Louis rebound from a 3-1 deficit and beat Anaheim
for the first time in five games at Kiel Center.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Kariya scored twice for Anaheim, which had its road unbeaten streak
stopped at five.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryan Helmer's first career goal gave St. Louis a 4-3 lead in the third
period. Helmer, a defenseman recalled from Worcester of the AHL on Feb. 11, beat
Anaheim goalie Guy Hebert at 10:47 of the period.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott Young scored his 17th at 2:02 of the first period to give St. Louis a
1-0 lead. Anaheim's Kip Miller tied it with a power-play goal at 10:21.
</P>
<P>
	   Kariya scored at 13:36 of the first to give Anaheim a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   With St. Louis short-handed in the second period, Kariya banked the puck off
Blues defenseman Chris Pronger from behind the net at 10:59 to increase
Anaheim's lead to 3-1. It was the seventh consecutive game the Mighty Ducks
scored on the power play.
</P>
<P>
	   Kariya's goals, which give him 34 this season, extended his personal
goal-scoring streak to three.
</P>
<P>
	   Teemu Selanne assisted on both of Kariya's goals to extend his scoring
streak to 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Demitra, who has 24 goals, got his first of the game at 15:18 of the second
to slice Anaheim's lead to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
	   At 2:07 of the third, Demitra scored a power-play goal to tie it 3-3.
</P>
<P>
	   After Helmer's goal gave St. Louis the lead, Demitra completed the hat trick
at 12:49 of the third to make it 5-3. Jamal Mayers added an empty-netter to cap
the scoring.
</P>
<P>
	   Hebert made 30 saves, while St. Louis goalie Roman Turek stopped 20 shots.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis defenseman Al MacInnis was scratched because of back spasms.

<HEADLINE> Carter Exhibits Slam Dunk Grace  </HEADLINE>
    By RICK GANO AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Vince Carter won the NBA slam dunk contest Saturday
night with a riveting above-the-rim demonstration that was almost perfect.
</P>
<P>
	   The Toronto Raptors star scored a perfect 50 on three of his five attempts
and got a 49 and 48 on the other two to defeat teammate Tracy McGrady and Steve
Francis for the title.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter used a hanger on his first dunk of the final round, driving the ball
down and then clinging on the rim from the crook of his elbow. It brought him
his third 50 of the night.
</P>
<P>
	   On his final dunk, Carter went sailing down the floor and took off just
inside the free throw line for a two-handed stuff that earned him a 48, enough
to beat Francis.
</P>
<P>
	   Francis finished the final round with 91 points and McGrady 77 after missing
his final attempt.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter set the tone with his first dunk of the night. He did a 360-degree
spin to his right in the lane and then brought ball up from his right hip before
powering it through the basket, sending the crowd into a frenzy and getting a
perfect 50.
</P>
<P>
	   Toronto teammate McGrady matched the 50 on his final dunk of the first
round, catching the ball after it bounced high on the floor and then making a
double clutch stuff.
</P>
<P>
	   But on Carter's third and final dunk of the first round it was apparent he
would be almost impossible to beat.
</P>
<P>
	   He took a bounce pass from McGrady -- one first-round dunk had to be done in
coordination with a teammate -- brought the ball under his right leg while he
was in the air and then slammed it through. It brought the judges out of their
seats and one of them, Isiah Thomas, jumped on the scorer's table to cheer.
</P>
<P>
	   "It made me say ohh, it made me saw ahh and then I just jumped," Thomas
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The popular contest was revived this year for the first time since 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Each dunk is scored from six to 10 by each judge. The first-round score is
based on a composite with the lowest score excluded and three of the six
contestants advancing to the finals.
</P>
<P>
	   Judges were Thomas, Cynthia Cooper, Rick Barry, George "Ice Man" Gervin and
Kenny Smith.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter had a first-round 100 to advance with McGrady (99) and Houston's
Steve Francis (95). Eliminated were Ricky Davis of Charlotte, Jerry Stackhouse
of Detroit and Philadelphia's Larry Hughes, who missed his first two attempts.

<HEADLINE> Kwan Wins Fourth U.S. Title  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY WILNER-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The last time Michelle Kwan skated this cautiously and with
so little fire, she lost the Olympic gold medal to Tara Lipinski.
</P>
<P>
	So she should thank some generous judges for helping her stave off the wave of
young Americans on Saturday night to win her third straight U.S. Figure Skating
Championships crown.
</P>
<P>
	While the four-time champion skated tentatively and fell once in the free
skate, her main competition -- 15-year-old Sasha Cohen and 14-year-old Sarah
Hughes -- also had falls. But they weren't as uninspired as Kwan. They simply
don't have the clout quite yet.
</P>
<P>
	``I was all business today, concentrated and centered,'' said Kwan, who has won
more U.S. championships than the likes of Kristi Yamaguchi, Rosalynn Sumners and
Dorothy Hamill. ``I felt strong and proud of myself at the end, because I didn't
open up anything.
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I wanted to go out and feel good about myself after the program. I
didn't want any pity.''
</P>
<P>
	Instead, she got charity.
</P>
<P>
	Not only from the judges, eight of whom placed her first -- Hughes got the
other top spot -- but from her competition.
</P>
<P>
	Cohen fell on a triple toe loop 3:38 into her 4-minute program. She did hit six
triples, but that crash was enough for Kwan to slip through.
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little tired and when I came down on the landing I just couldn't save
it,'' Cohen said. ``I am pretty happy, but I am somewhat disappointed with the
last jump. I thought the marks were fair.''
</P>
<P>
	Hughes already had fallen on a triple salchow, but otherwise was clean and was
the only woman who attempted and completed a triple-triple combination. Even so,
she got the nod from only one judge on her technical mark.
</P>
<P>
	``I had a little trouble at the end, that was obvious,'' Hughes said. ``I
fought through the program and tried to make every moment count. If I didn't, I
would regret it later.
</P>
<P>
	``Any program you do, if you challenge yourself, you should be very tired at
the end. Otherwise, you haven't given it your all.''
</P>
<P>
	While Kwan gave all she had, it appeared she was skating in a vacuum, never
connecting with the audience. It wasn't anywhere near what she's presented in
past nationals. Perhaps her hectic schedule as a freshman at UCLA, plus her
burgeoning commercial obligations, have cut too deeply into her training.
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a long week,'' Kwan admitted.

<HEADLINE> Weiss Wins Second U.S. Title  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Michael Weiss is the Artist currently known as the Champion.
</P>
<P>
	Let human pogo stick Timothy Goebel make history with his three quadruple
jumps. Weiss got the title that matters Saturday night in the U.S. Figure
Skating Championships, looking almost majestic with a flowing, expressive
program that earned him one 6.0 for artistry.
</P>
<P>
	``I've been on both sides,'' said Weiss, who won his second straight U.S.
title. ``I was there against Todd Eldredge when I came out and I was trying
quads, but he won.
</P>
<P>
	``The judges have shown there's a need to skate a solid program,'' he said. ``I
went back and worked on that, and I made sure I perfected it.''
</P>
<P>
	One judge agreed, awarding Weiss his first-ever perfect 6.0. When the mark
flashed across the scoreboard, he gasped. His wife, Lisa, jumped up and down.
The crowd, which had already been on its feet for hometown favorite Goebel, rose
again and started screaming.
</P>
<P>
	``That was amazing,'' Weiss said. ``I'll cherish it for the rest of my life. It
was the first one I've ever received and I hope to get more in the future. It
was very special to me. It just proves we've been pushing in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
	Trifun Zivanovic, last year's silver medalist, finished third, but he'll have
to sit out next month's world championships. The United States can send only two
men.
</P>
<P>
	While Goebel and his quad arsenal were the rage all week, Weiss kept insisting
a skater needs more. He should know. It was only three years ago he landed the
quad that wasn't and finished second to Eldredge, who didn't have Weiss' jumps,
but was light years ahead artistically.
</P>
<P>
	So Weiss got in touch with his artistic side. The tie-dyed shirts and Santana
guitar riffs were out. Beethoven and classical-style skating were in.
</P>
<P>
	``The judges have stressed that they like you to skate a solid program,'' Weiss
said. ``And I thought I did.''
</P>
<P>
	Skating to ``Carmen,'' Weiss looked as if he could feel the music, drawing in
the audience with his expressiveness. He didn't do a quad, opening up in midair
and hanging on for the triple toe loop instead. But he didn't need it. He nailed
nine triples, including four in combination.
</P>
<P>
	But it was the rest of his program that won his second title. He had a flair, a
passion that no one else approached. His spins were tight and precise, his
footwork intricate.
</P>
<P>
	While other Americans look raw, Weiss puts the finishing touches on every move
he makes.
</P>
<P>
	``As everyone said, it's much harder to defend, to win a second time,'' Weiss
said. ``I'm thrilled to pull it off.''
</P>
<P>
	The marks were relatively close -- six judges had Weiss first and three had
Goebel -- but they really shouldn't have been. Weiss performed, Goebel did
tricks to music.
</P>
<P>
	But oh, what tricks they were. Goebel didn't just make history, he set the bar
so high other skaters are going to have to pole vault over it to top him. No one
had ever landed a clean quadruple jump in the nationals before. Goebel did three
of them -- in a span of one minute.
</P>
<P>
	His last quad, a salchow, was so high he probably could have touched the
scoreboard had he put his hand up. Or thrown another turn in and made it a
quintuple.
</P>
<P>
	``To do this in any competition and to do it in front of so many family and
friends, is very special,'' Goebel said, still shaking.
</P>
<P>
	``This is just the most amazing thing I've ever done in my life,'' he added.
``Once I hit the toe, I knew I'd hit all three.''
</P>
<P>
	Goebel is the first to admit his jumps, not his artistry, are his strength. He
was the first American to land a quad, a salchow in the 1999 Junior Grand Prix
finals, and he's the only man in the world to land three in a single program.
</P>
<P>
	Needing a huge night to knock off Weiss, he stuck with what he knows works.
About a minute into his program, he skated right in front of the judges and
launched a quad salchow-triple toe loop combination. Both jumps were perfect,
and Goebel tossed off the quad as effortlessly as most people take two stairs at
a time.
</P>
<P>
	Next up was a quadruple toe loop, and he followed that with the quadruple
salchow. He did so many jumps he spent almost as much time in the air as on the
ice.
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not disappointed at all,'' Goebel said. ``My goal this year was to skate
a strong program and make worlds. I did both.''

<HEADLINE> Harvey Gets NAACP Best Actor Award  </HEADLINE>
    By CADONNA M. PEYTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Harvey took best actor in a television comedy
series Saturday during the 31st NAACP Image Awards, saying the honor meant much
more to him than others because of the organization presenting the award.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is from us, for us, that's why it means something to me," said Harvey
of "The Steve Harvey Show," in which he plays the vice principal of an urban
high school. The series appears on the Warner Bros. WB television network.
</P>
<P>
	   Best actresses in a comedy series went to twins Tia and Tamera Mowry for
their roles in "Sister, Sister," also on the WB network.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
announced that a shortage of minority characters in television made it difficult
for Image Award organizers to select nominees in the TV categories this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The NAACP has confronted the networks for months about the lack of minority
characters.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue of minorities in the entertainment industry came to a boil in July
when NAACP and a coalition of Hispanic groups condemned a near-total lack of
minority characters in fall series. The groups threatened lawsuits and boycotts.
</P>
<P>
	   But within the past months, NAACP officials met with TV network executives
who promised to work toward enhancing diversity on their shows.
</P>
<P>
	   In the television categories, CBS had 18 nominations. ABC was next with 15,
followed by HBO with 14, Warner Bros. with 12 and NBC with 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Although CBS had the most nominations, critics say both CBS and Fox are not
putting enough minorities to work in television. Both networks recently
announced that they will have more minority characters this fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Agreements by Fox and CBS are similar to those signed by NBC and ABC last
month, focusing on changes in minority representation through the companies --
both on-screen and off.
</P>
<P>
	   The 31st NAACP Image Awards, which honors minorities in film, television,
music and literature, took place Friday and Saturday at the Pasadena Civic
Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, CBS won for outstanding drama series for "Touched by an Angel,"
co-starring Della Reese. Fox took the outstanding variety series or special for
"1999 Essence Awards." Civil rights heroine, Rosa Parks, won for supporting
acress in a drama series for her appearance on "Touched by an Angel."
</P>
<P>
	   Angela Bassett won outstanding supporting actress in the motion picture,
"Music of the Heart." Halle Berry won outstanding actress in a television movie,
mini-series or dramatic special for the lead role in "Introducing Dorothy
Dandridge," an HBO movie about the first black woman nominated for an Academy
Award as best actress. Berry also won a Golden Globe for her role.
</P>
<P>
	   The Image Awards show is scheduled to air April 6 on Fox.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Adam Oates scored the go-ahead goal early in the
third period as the Washington Capitals beat the Nashville Predators 4-2
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Oates fired the puck from the left corner toward the crease, where it banked
off Predators defenseman Bill Houlder's skate and past goalie Tomas Vokoun to
snap a 2-2 tie at 5:56.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Simon had two goals and Sergei Gonchar also scored as the Capitals
improved to 14-2-3 since Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   David Legwand and Patric Kjellberg scored for Nashville.
</P>
<P>
	   Legwand, playing for the first time since Jan. 13 because of a broken left
foot, got the opening goal on a first-period power play at 9:40.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonchar tied it 1-1 on a power-play goal at 3:55 of the second period with a
shot off the skate of Nashville's Craig Millar.
</P>
<P>
	   Simon put the Caps ahead 2-1 just 1:18 later. He pounced on a loose puck in
the left circle and beat Vokoun.
</P>
<P>
	   Kjellberg tied it 2-2 at 15:11 of the second. Kjellberg was camped alone in
the slot when Cliff Ronning spotted him with a pass from behind Caps goalie Olaf
Kolzig, who made 29 saves.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the 20th goal for Kjellberg, whom the Predators signed as a free
agent in 1998 after he played the previous five seasons in his native Sweden.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Simon's second goal of the game came into an empty net with 48.7
seconds left.

	   Nashville's Sergei Krivokrasov, the club's leading scorer with 25 goals last

<HEADLINE> No. 7 Arizona 73, Washington St. 50  </HEADLINE>
    By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PULLMAN, Wash. (AP) -- Arizona had the answers inside and outside against
Washington State.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wildcats had 7-foot-1 center Loren Woods clogging the inside, forcing
Washington State to let fly from the outside. But too many shots clanged off the
rim and No. 7 Arizona rolled to a 73-50 victory.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had practiced on defending the perimeter. They're good 3-point
shooters," said Woods, who recently tied an NCAA record with 14 blocked shots in
a game. He had five Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington State made just 6-of-22 3-pointers in the game, and shot just 34
percent overall, in losing its 12th straight game. Arizona has won 30 straight
over Washington State, the longest winning streak in the nation among conference
opponents.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods scored 10 points and grabbed four rebounds, but it was fear of his
blocking ability that dictated the game.
</P>
<P>
	   "He keeps the ball up high. He's like a 10-foot guy out there," Washington
State coach Paul Graham said. "We tell our guys when the shot clock goes down
they should take it inside.
</P>
<P>
	   "But Woods is back there waiting for it," Graham said.
</P>
<P>
	   Freshman Gilbert Arenas matched his season high with 24 points for Arizona
(21-4, 10-1 Pacific-10).
</P>
<P>
	   Washington State (5-15, 0-11) has not won since beating Portland State on
Dec. 20. This was their worst home loss since an 86-62 defeat by Arizona in
1990.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cougars had little chance of breaking the losing streak Saturday, as
Arizona opened the game with a 3-point basket by Luke Walton and never trailed.
</P>
<P>
	   The undersized Cougars, respectful of 7-foot-1 Arizona center Loren Woods,
hesitated to take the ball inside. But they also failed to connect from outside,
and Woods still ended up with five blocks. Washington State has no players
taller than 6-foot-8 Chris Crosby.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Wright scored 19 points and grabbed eight rebounds for Arizona.
</P>
<P>
	   Crosby led Washington State with 14 points. David Adams had 10 for the
Cougars, who shot just 34 percent in the game, compared to 60 percent for the
Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
	   Arenas scored 11 points in the first half, including consecutive baskets
that lifted Arizona to a 22-11 lead with 9:15 left. A 15-3 Arizona run over the
final seven minutes have them a 39-19 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington State made just eight-of-33 field goals in the first half for 24
percent, while the Wildcats were shooting 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "You look at our inside percentage today, with 15 out of 26 from the three
inside guys," said Arizona coach Lute Olson, referring to Walton, Woods and
Michael Wright. "That is credited to the perimeter people, for getting it to
where we could score."
</P>
<P>
	   Washington State did not shoot a free throw in the first half, and Tyrone
Evans sank their first one with 10:56 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
	   The second half started a little more evenly, but Wright's basket and two
free throws lifted Arizona to a 54-31 lead with about 12 minutes left.
</P>
<P>
	   Seven straight points by Arenas gave Arizona a 61-32 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cougars have lost 15 straight Pac-10 games over two seasons and the 0-11
league mark this season is the second-worst opening in their history.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   DALLAS (AP) -- From his first NFL boss to the guy who fired him, Tom Landry
was remembered Saturday for his stoic demeanor as a coach and for his superb
character as a person.
</P>
<P>
	   "His strength, faith and humility are responsible for so much of what the
Dallas Cowboys are all about," said Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who fired Landry
in February 1989 after 29 seasons. "He courageously displayed those
characteristics throughout his lifetime -- in victory, defeat, prosperity and
illness."
</P>
<P>
	   Landry died Saturday evening following a nine-month battle with a form of
leukemia. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
	   "He didn't get excited," said former Pittsburgh coach Chuck Noll, who beat
Landry in two Super Bowls. "He always had everything under control. He was very
analytical, a guy who was a great technician, and his teams reflected that."
</P>
<P>
	   New York Giants owner Wellington Mara, whose family ran the team when Landry
broke into the NFL, said the former coach's smooth exterior concealed a burning
desire to win.
</P>
<P>
	   "Even though he held his emotions in check, I know how intensely competitive
he was," Mara said. "Even when they were calling him the cardboard man for his
demeanor on the sidelines, I knew how intensely competitive he was and how badly
he wanted to win."
</P>
<P>
	   Calvin Hill was a first-round pick by Landry in 1969. He remained with the
Cowboys through 1974 and returned to the organization in recent years as
director of player programs.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a sad day for anybody who's been associated with the Cowboys," Hill
said at the NBA All-Star game in Oakland, Calif. "I think everybody takes refuge
in the fact that Tom was prepared for this to happen. Coach Landry was at peace
-- and spiritually, he was prepared to go to another place. But it's still hard
to believe because he was always so vital."
</P>
<P>
	   Lee Roy Jordan, a star linebacker for the Cowboys from 1973-76, had the
privilege of playing for Landry in the pros and for Paul "Bear" Bryant in
college at Alabama. He said they were both excellent planners who left little to
chance.
</P>
<P>
	   "Coach Landry was so stable, so consistent," Jordan said. "He never got
excited. He never got down. He didn't show great emotions when things were going
right and he didn't show great dejection when things were going wrong. I think
that made him a great leader."
</P>
<P>
	   Dan Reeves played for Landry, then was an assistant coach in Dallas before
becoming a Super Bowl coach in Denver and Atlanta. Reeves said he's tried
patterning himself after Landry on and off the field.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was someone who had tremendous knowledge of the NFL, but he was also a
man of such integrity," Reeves said. "He had a strong Christian faith that was
unusual at that time. And he didn't just talk it. He walked it, too."

<TEXT>
<P>
    RUSTON, La. (AP) -- Louisiana Tech's game plan -- strike quickly on offense
and handcuff Western Kentucky star ShaRae Mansfield -- worked to perfection.
</P>
<P>
	   Tamicha Jackson made five 3-pointers and scored 23 points Saturday night as
No. 2 Louisiana Tech built a 31-point halftime lead on the way to a 93-72 Sun
Belt Conference victory over Western Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
	   "That first half we really played great basketball, we kept Mansfield from
scoring a basket and did good job not sending her to the free-throw line,"
Louisiana Tech coach Leon Barmore said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mansfield, the Sun Belt's leading scorer (18.9 points) and rebounder (10.1),
had 13 points and eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's what coach stressed in practice all week," Jackson said. "Mansfield
had so many rebounds the first time we played and that was our goal to stop
her."
</P>
<P>
	   Tech's ninth straight victory was its 21st in a row at home and 34th
straight in the conference. The Lady Techsters (19-2 overall, 10-0 Sun Belt)
completed a season sweep of Western Kentucky (15-8, 9-3), which had won 10 of 11
since an 85-61 loss to Tech last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Tech hit 25-of-35 shots (71.4 percent), including 7-of-12 3-pointers, in
taking a 61-30 halftime lead. Tech finished 8-for-18 from long range in the
game.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson was 5-of-9 on 3-pointers and 9-of-15 from the field overall.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were playing a zone defense," Jackson said. It left me open and it
just so happens my shots were going down."
</P>
<P>
	   Ayana Walker added 17 points for Tech, Betty Lennox had 14 and reserve Chery
Ford 13.
</P>
<P>
	   Jaime Walz led Western with 26 points.

<HEADLINE> Carter Exhibits Slam Dunk Grace  </HEADLINE>
    By RICK GANO AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Vince Carter won the NBA slam dunk contest Saturday
night with a riveting above-the-rim demonstration that was almost perfect.
</P>
<P>
	   The Toronto Raptors star scored a perfect 50 on three of his five attempts
and got a 49 and 48 on the other two to defeat teammate Tracy McGrady and Steve
Francis for the title.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter used a unique hanger on his first dunk of the final round, driving
the ball down and then clinging on the rim from the crook of his elbow. It
brought him his third 50 of the night.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was something different and I didn't know how the judges would react,"
Carter said, still trying to gather himself after winning the competition.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's unbelievable. It hasn't sunk in yet. I'm having trouble. I just
remember back in the days when me and my friends used to tape the dunk contests
and watch them over and over."
</P>
<P>
	   On his final dunk, Carter went sailing down the floor and took off just
inside the free-throw line for a two-handed stuff that earned him a 48 and a
final round 98, enough to beat Francis.
</P>
<P>
	   Francis finished the final round with 91 points and McGrady 77 after missing
his final attempt.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter said the final dunk was an attempt to duplicate one of Julius
Erving's most famous dunks when he took off from the foul line.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wasn't too happy with it, but I'll take it," Carter said. "I wish I could
have tried it again. I think I would have done better."
</P>
<P>
	   Carter set the tone with his first dunk of the night. He did a 360-degree
spin to his right in the lane and then brought ball up from his right hip before
powering it through the basket, sending the crowd into a frenzy and getting a
perfect 50.
</P>
<P>
	   Toronto teammate McGrady matched the 50 on his final dunk of the first
round, catching the ball after it bounced high on the floor and then making a
double clutch stuff.
</P>
<P>
	   But on Carter's third and final dunk of the first round it was apparent he
would be almost impossible to beat.
</P>
<P>
	   He took a bounce pass from McGrady -- one first-round dunk had to be done in
coordination with a teammate -- brought the ball under his right leg while he
was in the air and then slammed it through. It brought the judges out of their
seats and one of them, Isiah Thomas, jumped on the scorer's table to cheer.
</P>
<P>
	   "It made me say ohh, it made me saw ahh and then I just jumped," Thomas
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The popular contest was revived this year for the first time since 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Each dunk is scored from six to 10 by each judge. The first-round score is
based on a composite with the lowest score excluded and three of the six
contestants advancing to the finals.
</P>
<P>
	   Judges were Thomas, Cynthia Cooper, Rick Barry, George "Ice Man" Gervin and
Kenny Smith.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter had a first-round 100 to advance with McGrady (99) and Francis (95).
Eliminated were Ricky Davis of Charlotte, Jerry Stackhouse of Detroit and
Philadelphia's Larry Hughes, who missed his first two attempts.

<HEADLINE> Report: Russia To Shut Down Reactors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Russian government has told U.S. officials it wants to
abandon a joint project to convert military atomic reactors to civilian use and
shut them down instead, The Washington Post reported in Sunday editions.
</P>
<P>
	   An agreement reached in 1997 committed Russia to halting production of
weapons-grade plutonium by the end of this year, removing enough material for
nearly 400 new nuclear weapons each year.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States was to help pay for the project, estimated to cost about
$80 million.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Post said Russian officials informed a U.S. delegation last week
that cost overruns and warnings of a possible Chernobyl-type catastrophe had
prompted them to shut down the remaining military reactors rather than convert
them to civilian use.
</P>
<P>
	   Energy needs for cities where the reactors are located would be provided by
conventional sources at a cost of about $230 million, most of which the Russians
want paid by the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The Post said the Clinton administration is studying the new proposal,
although it has expressed skepticism about the projected cost.
</P>
<P>
	   Independent U.S. experts welcomed the shift, however, largely because of
problems and delay with the conversion program, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a project that was very well intentioned but has been bungled in
implementation to the point where killing it might be the best thing for nuclear
nonproliferation and nuclear safety,'' Alan Kuperman, a consultant with the
Nuclear Control Institute, a private think tank, told the Post.
</P>
<P>
	   In a related matter, the Energy Department unveiled a new $100 million plan
last week to construct storage plants for spent fuel from existing Russian
civilian reactors that would otherwise be converted into plutonium.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Coach Tom Landry Dies  </HEADLINE>
    By JAIME ARON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Tom Landry, the Dallas Cowboys coach who led America's
Team to five Super Bowls and paced the sidelines for three decades wearing a
stone face, business suit and his famous fedora, died Saturday. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
	   Landry had been undergoing treatment since May for acute myelogenous
leukemia. He died at Baylor University Medical Center about 6 p.m. CST,
surrounded by his family.
</P>
<P>
	   Landry, who coached the Cowboys for their first 29 years, won two Super
Bowls with star quarterback Roger Staubach. His 270 victories are more than any
NFL coach except Don Shula and George Halas.
</P>
<P>
	   Commissioner Paul Tagliabue praised Landry as "the NFL at its best."
</P>
<P>
	   "He will always rank as one of the all-time great coaches and as an
architect of one of the most successful teams in sports history," he said. "He
will be remembered for many special reasons, including his record as a coach,
the innovations he brought to our game, and the personal integrity he
displayed."
</P>
<P>
	   Landry considered those innovations his greatest contribution. His legacy
continued through the coaches he produced, including Atlanta's Dan Reeves and
former New Orleans coach Mike Ditka.
</P>
<P>
	   "He shaped my philosophy on everything," Reeves said Saturday night. "I
followed his philosophy on football and how he handled himself on and off the
field. He was a tremendous influence on me."
</P>
<P>
	   Owner Jerry Jones, who fired Landry the day he bought the team in 1989
following three straight losing seasons, on Saturday night described him as "the
single most important figure in the history of this franchise."
</P>
<P>
	   In Landry's first season, 1960, the expansion Cowboys went 0-11-1. He didn't
have a winning season until his seventh. But that began a streak of 20
consecutive winning seasons, 13 division titles and five Super Bowl appearances.
</P>
<P>
	   His final record was 270-178-6, a .601 winning percentage. And when he left,
he was as much a symbol of the Cowboys as the star on their helmets.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the whole Cowboys image came from him," said Staubach, who
introduced Landry at his Hall of Fame enshrinement in 1990, just as Landry had
done for him in '85. "I think Tom will always make the Dallas Cowboys more than
a football team."
</P>
<P>
	   Landry was a star at the University of Texas, then a defensive back for the
New York Giants in one of the innovative defenses of the early '50s -- "The
Umbrella," the first to put four backs deep to counter the passing game.
</P>
<P>
	   At 29, he became a player-coach in charge of the defense, a job now known as
the defensive coordinator. He changed the front seven of the Umbrella from a 5-2
to a 4-3, essentially creating the middle linebacker position for Sam Huff. The
system became such a success that Landry later had to devise the multiple
offense to counter it. Both alignments remain standards -- from Pee Wee to the
pros.
</P>
<P>
	   General manager Tex Schramm was still trying to get an NFL franchise in
Dallas when he introduced Landry as the team's first coach. Their agreement was
that Schramm would run the business side and Landry would be in charge of
football.
</P>
<P>
	   A dynasty was formed through the unlikely pairing of the straight-laced,
religious Landry and Schramm, the flashy showman whose promotional flair
included bringing scantily clad cheerleaders to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were totally different," Schramm said. "We were never close socially,
but we got along very well because he had his domain and we each knew where the
lines were. I respected him, he respected me and things worked perfectly."
</P>
<P>
	   Landry's Xs and Os betrayed his bland persona. He thrived on doing things
differently, especially if he could mix in deception.
</P>
<P>
	   He created the "Flex" defense that placed one tackle a half-yard behind the
other and he used gadget plays on offense, notably the quarterback throwback and
the halfback pass.
</P>
<P>
	   His offensive line also had a gimmick -- it would often crouch down, raise
up and then reset, a style often imitated by kids on playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Landry was emotionless on the sidelines and in the locker room, even in the
bitter cold of the "Ice Bowl." He avoided getting close to his players for fear
it would interfere with personnel decisions, and he ruled through a stare known
as "The Look."
</P>
<P>
	   Former running back Walt Garrison summed it up best when he was asked if he
ever saw Landry smile.
</P>
<P>
	   "No," Garrison said, "but I was only there nine years."
</P>
<P>
	   Landry worked differently with his assistant coaches, many of whom became
NFL head coaches. The contrast was stunning for those who had played for him.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you played for him, he's the boss," said Ditka, a tight end for four
years and an assistant under Landry for nine. "When I coached for him, he was
the boss, too, but when you played for him, there was a fear in there."
</P>
<P>
	   Landry spent his final years devoted to business endeavors and Christian
organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1989, the city of Dallas held a "Hats Off to Tom Landry Day," which
included a parade that drew 100,000 people. The guest of honor cried and called
it the "most exciting and meaningful" day in his life.
</P>
<P>
	   He stayed away from football except for his 1990 Hall of Fame induction and
his 1993 induction into the team's Ring of Honor at Texas Stadium. Instead of a
jersey number, a tiny hat hangs next to his name and the years "1960-88."
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas Wade Landry was born Sept. 11, 1924, in Mission, Texas. After one
semester of college, he joined the Army Air Corps and spent two years as a
bomber pilot in World War II. Although his older brother Robert died flying a
B-17, Tom flew 30 combat missions and survived one crash landing.
</P>
<P>
	   His tough exterior was necessary in his early days in Dallas. Public
criticism was peaking after his fourth season, 1963. Landry had a 13-38-3 record
and one year left on his original contract. Owner Clint Murchison showed his
support with a 10-year extension.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cowboys played host to a playoff game for the first time on Jan. 1,
1967. Green Bay jumped ahead 14-0, but quarterback Don Meredith rallied the
Cowboys within 34-27. Dallas drove to the Packers' 2 in the final minutes, but
failed to score the game-tying touchdown. Green Bay went on to win the first
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Landry's first postseason victory came the following season in Cleveland,
setting up a rematch against the Packers -- only this time in Green Bay, in the
game remembered as the "Ice Bowl."
</P>
<P>
	   Playing in a wind chill that dropped to 40 below, the Cowboys again trailed
14-0, then led 17-14. Bart Starr's touchdown on a quarterback sneak with 13
seconds left gave the Packers a 21-17 victory. Again, they went on to win the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can't believe that call, the sneak," said Landry, who wore a long,
fur-lined coat and matching fur hunter's cap borrowed from one of the team's
minority owners. "It wasn't a good call. But now, it's a great call."
</P>
<P>
	   Fans lashed out at Landry's inability to win big games, citing his lack of
emotion on the sidelines. They wanted him to be more like Packers coach Vince
Lombardi, whose bombastic style Landry had seen with the Giants, where Landry
was the defensive assistant and Lombardi the offensive assistant. Landry, who
modeled himself after Paul Brown, couldn't be someone he wasn't.
</P>
<P>
	   Cleveland knocked Dallas out of the next two playoffs, then the Cowboys lost
to Baltimore in the 1971 Super Bowl on a field goal by Jim O'Brien in the final
seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cowboys got tagged as "Next Year's Champions," for coming up short of a
title.
</P>
<P>
	   But the following year, with Staubach at quarterback, Dallas returned to the
Super Bowl and beat Miami 24-3. Players hoisted him onto their shoulders and,
finally, there were some cracks in the stone facade.
</P>
<P>
	   "I still see that image of him being carried off the field," Staubach said.
"I think that was a big deal to him, the best in his life. Seeing that smile on
his face showed how happy he was to finally get over that hump." After losing in
the Super Bowl following the 1975 season with a team Landry called his favorite,
he reached the top again in 1977, Tony Dorsett's rookie year. The Cowboys beat
Denver 27-10 in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Things would never be the same again. Dallas lost to Pittsburgh in the next
Super Bowl, then was beaten in the NFC Championship in the 1980, '81 and '82
seasons. The '81 season is best remembered for San Francisco's Dwight Clark
making "The Catch."
</P>
<P>
	   A playoff shutout at home in 1985 was followed by a losing season in '86,
Landry's first since 1964. A combination of bad draft picks and poor personnel
decisions sunk the team, and Dallas went 3-13 in his final season.
</P>
<P>
	   "People will forget me quick," Landry said when he was fired.
</P>
<P>
	   Landry is survived by Alicia Landry, his wife of 50 years; a son, Tom Jr.;
and a daughter, Kitty Phillips. Another daughter, Lisa Childress, died of cancer
in 1995.

<HEADLINE> No. 6 Michigan St. 61, Wisconsin 44  </HEADLINE>
    By GREG BEACHAM AP Sports Writer

<P>
	   MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- A focus on the boards helped Michigan State rebound
from its loss to Purdue.
</P>
<P>
	   Morris Peterson had 18 points and 10 rebounds as the No. 6 Spartans kept a
share of the Big Ten lead with a 61-44 victory over Wisconsin on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   After the Boilermakers surprised Michigan State 70-67 on Tuesday night, the
Spartans (18-6, 8-2 Big Ten) came back with dominant performances in rebounding
and on defense.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan State averages an NCAA-best 13.6 more rebounds than its opponents,
and the Spartans' 50-23 rebounding advantage was the difference against
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it was our rebounding and then making shots when we needed to,"
Mateen Cleaves said. "It was an ugly game, but that's how it's going to be
against Wisconsin, and we just focused on the boards."
</P>
<P>
	   Resiliency has been a trademark of coach Tom Izzo's teams in recent years.
Michigan State hasn't lost back-to-back games since December 1998, and the
Spartans' average margin of victory in games after a loss is 22 points this
year.
</P>
<P>
	   "We put a lot of preparation into this game," Izzo said. "I thought our
defense got tougher tonight."
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan State never trailed and wasn't threatened by the Badgers, who lost
for the third time in four games. Wisconsin admitted to being slightly in awe of
the Spartans, who they'll visit for a rematch next Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're everything you want in a basketball team," Wisconsin's Andy Kowske
said. "They're bigger than us, they're quicker than us, and it showed. ...
They're better than us in probably every category."
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan State exacted revenge for its 66-51 loss at Wisconsin last season,
the Spartans' only conference defeat in the 1998-99 campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan State's win and Ohio State's 88-75 victory over Penn State set up a
showdown for the Big Ten lead Tuesday night when the No. 5 Buckeyes visit the
Spartans in East Lansing. Each team has two conference losses.
</P>
<P>
	   Against the undersized Badgers (12-11, 4-7), Michigan State built a 35-20
lead with a 13-2 run in the closing minutes of the first half. Peterson, who had
just five points in the Spartans' loss at Purdue, had 13 first-half points and
scored five straight shortly after halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   "We felt kind of helpless," said Maurice Linton, who led the Badgers with 10
points. "We played hard, but their talent was such a factor. They're loaded."
</P>
<P>
	   Jason Richardson dunked an alley-oop pass from Cleaves that gave Michigan
State a 45-28 lead with 12 minutes to play. The lead stretched to 23 points
moments later as the Spartans cruised to the victory.
</P>
<P>
	   A.J. Granger had 11 points and 11 rebounds for Michigan State, which won
even though Cleaves struggled in a 2-of-10 shooting performance.
</P>
<P>
	   "When we lose a game, we have a different focus in practice until our next
game," Cleaves said. "Guys don't like losing here."
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Vershaw, Wisconsin's leading scorer, went 1-for-10 from the field. The
Badgers could have used some help from Ron Dayne, who got a standing ovation
when he and his Heisman Trophy made a halftime appearance at center court.
</P>
<P>
	   A physical game occasionally brought bad feelings between the teams to the
surface. Cleaves and Vershaw had to be separated after an argument with three
minutes to play, and at least two minor skirmishes erupted in the stands.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wisconsin student section's chants of "Alcoholic" -- a reference to
Cleaves' troubles with the law over allegedly stealing a bottle of beer in April
-- were nearly drowned out by chants of "All-American" from the sizable Michigan
State cheering section in the upper deck of the Kohl Center.
