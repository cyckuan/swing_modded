LIGHTS! CAMERA! ARPAIO! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - No sooner did an Arizona production company announce
its plans to make a ``cute or fun'' movie about Maricopa County
Sheriff Joe Arpaio when serious casting problems set in.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arpaio sees Robert DeNiro or Al Pacino in the title role of a
film to be based on his book, America's Toughest Sheriff, though he
says he's willing to settle for Joe Pesci.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, producers have floated the name of Roseanne's
ex-husband, Tom Arnold, perhaps because the late Jackie Gleason
isn't available to reprise the Sheriff Buford T. Justice character
he perfected in Smokey and the Bandit.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just the beginning of the casting quandary.
</P>
<P>
   Who will play Arpaio's right-hand man, double-dipping Deputy
Dave Hendershott?
</P>
<P>
   Don Knotts is still alive, but anyone who knows Hendershott can
tell you Knotts isn't a big enough actor to fill the deputy's
shoes, or any other part of his wardrobe. Still, the role cries out
for the performer who immortalized Barney Fife.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the chief executive officer of Desert Winds
production company told The Republic that the movie of Arpaio's
life will be ``cute or fun.``
</P>
<P>
   But what about David Michael Pecard? Who'll play the AWOL
soldier from Fort Huachuca who talked his way into the sheriff's
inner circle, obtained keys, a badge and an office, and even posed
as Arpaio's bodyguard?
</P>
<P>
   I hear O.J.'s available.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the deputies who say they were forced out of
their jobs by henchmen trying to purge news leaks from the
Sheriff's Office? Perhaps they could play themselves. They need the
work.
</P>
<P>
   Who'll get the ``cute or fun'' role of Wayne Bates, the postal
worker who was hauled off to jail in front of TV cameras for using
pepper spray on a pair of fenced-in dogs? No charges were filed,
though Bates did file a whopping lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   And who will they cast as Tim Griffin, a one-time inmate at
Joe's jail who was denied medical treatment for a perforated ulcer
after begging for help? A Superior Court jury ordered the county to
pay him $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Who'll play George E. Sullivan and Gene Miller, experts who
produced reports on the brutality in Joe's lockups?
</P>
<P>
   A convincing young actor is needed to portray Jeremy Flanders.
He was beaten by inmates at Joe's Tent City jail and later awarded
more than $900,000.
</P>
<P>
   And what about Richard Post? He's a paraplegic abused while in
sheriff's custody and later paid $800,000. There aren't many actors
who can do ``cute or fun'' from a wheelchair, particularly when
being roughed up.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be especially difficult to cast the part of County
Attorney Rick Romley. The local prosecutor recently joined the long
list of those who've filed suit against Arpaio. It's all part of a
two-man feud that's been nastier, longer-running and more
entertaining than the one made famous by Boss Hogg and the Dukes of
Hazzard.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's the problem of financing. Movies are expensive
propositions. They require the support of wealthy investors.
</P>
<P>
   I'm personally acquainted with a nice couple who recently came
into $8.25 million. Jaron and Deena Norberg received the cash from
Maricopa County to settle a lawsuit they'd filed after their son
died horribly at the hands of Joe's guards.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, even if some of that $8.25 million was used to solve
money problems for producers of the ``cute or fun'' movie they'd
still be left with a tricky casting dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Who'll play Scott Norberg? &QL;

 HELLING WORKING TO SEPARATE LABOR ROLE FROM
PITCHING (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By T.R. SULLIVAN
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ The clock is ticking toward another labor
showdown between baseball owners and players. When it happens _
later this season or in the off-season _ Rangers pitcher Rick
Helling plans to be in the middle of it.
</P>
<P>
   Helling is beginning his second season as a member of the Major
League Players Association's executive board, which is directly
involved in negotiations with the owners about the Basic Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think with my education, I've always kind of been a
lawyer,'' said Helling, who graduated from Stanford in 1993. ``I
like to argue. I like to be involved in the discussions. I'm not
worried about what might happen. I'll be on the front lines, and
that's exactly how I want it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Basic Agreement expires after this season, although the
players' association has an option to extend it through the 2001
season. Helling said ``more chances than not'' the union will
exercise that option.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, a new agreement must be negotiated within the next
two years, and baseball owners and players have never reached an
agreement without an owners' lockout or a players' strike.
</P>
<P>
   The last time that happened was in 1994, when the players walked
out in August, and the World Series was canceled. But Helling said
he thinks the two sides can reach an agreement without a strike or
lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not to say it will be easy, but I don't think the
players and the owners want to go through what happened last
time,'' Helling said. ``On the owners' side, a new television deal
is coming up. They need to go to the networks and say `There's
labor peace for the next six or seven years; you don't have to
worry about a strike.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The players, we know how hard it was to get back the fans, and
we don't want to have to go through it again. Both sides want to
get the best deal possible, but there are reasons to get it done
and make it as peaceful and as smooth as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers would also like to avoid an ugly situation similar
to the one that happened the last time one of their best starting
pitchers was heavily involved in labor matters.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown was pitching for the Rangers in 1994 when he was the
team's player representative and on the union executive board. But
after winning a combined 36 games in 1992-93, Brown went 7-9 with a
4.82 earned-run average in 1994, easily his worst season in the
majors.
</P>
<P>
   He became a free agent after the season, and the Rangers
mercurial ace,] refused to even offer arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're looking at different personalities,'' Rangers
general manager Doug Melvin said. ``Rick is a pretty level-headed
guy. You can sit down and have a good conversation with him on
anything. Rick is the kind of guy who understands both sides,
management and player.''
</P>
<P>
   Other labor warriors have been able to keep high-level
negotiations from affecting their performances. Pitcher David Cone
has long been a high-ranking member of the union, and, in 1994, he
won the Cy Young Award while pitching for the Kansas City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Rick can handle it,'' said pitching coach Dick Bosman,
who served eight years as a player representative and was once
released by Oakland A's owner Charlie Finley because of his union
duties. ``\RHelling\S knows it's business as usual when you come to
the ballpark. I don't think players have a lot of problems with
management that they used to. They realize it's business and
nothing personal.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of significant differences between Helling
and Brown. First, Helling doesn't have the double duty of being the
Rangers' player representative. Tim Crabtree handles that job.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Helling has avoided the hostile salary disputes Brown
went through with the Rangers every off-season. Brown went through
two bitter arbitration hearings with the club and, before that,
staged a one-day walkout in spring training in a salary dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Helling has avoided two years of arbitration by signing a
three-year contract with the Rangers before last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it took us a day and a half to get it done,'' Melvin
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see \Rthe union role\S affecting me,'' Helling said.
``I'm pretty good at separating baseball from the business side and
from family. Whatever happens in the meeting room or at home, once
I step on that field, it's all baseball. It's all part of the
business. The owners are trying to get the best deal they can;
we're trying to get the best deal we can.''

 DESPITE STADIUM REVENUE, ASTROS KEEP LID ON
SPENDING (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By SIMON
GONZALEZ c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ There's a modern baseball theorem that goes
something like this: When you get a new stadium, you go on a
spending spree.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers and the Cleveland Indians became contenders after
moving into state-of-the-art, revenue-generating ballparks that
allowed them to bump payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Mariners upgraded to the high-rent district midway
through last season, then spent the off-season signing six free
agents, including John Olerud and Aaron Sele.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Tigers are moving into new digs this year. To
celebrate, they traded for Juan Gonzalez and offered him a
megabucks contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Astros also have a new ballpark this season. They're
abandoning the Astrodome, the mausoleum of a stadium they called
home since 1965, and moving into Enron Field, a modern facility
with all the bells and whistles that add up to tremendous new
revenue streams.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros have won the National League Central three
consecutive seasons, and intend to contend again this year. But
they won't do it the way the Rangers and Indians did, and the way
the Mariners and Tigers plan.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the increased revenue that comes with a new
ballpark, the Astros didn't significantly bump their payroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with new stadiums and the prospect of sellout crowds, we
can't afford a payroll that some of the major-market clubs can
afford,'' Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``As we move
into the new stadium, our commitment to being competitive is still
there. But we are not committed to the continuation of deficit
spending and losing $10-15 million every year.''
</P>
<P>
   By spending more on payroll _ it was about $52 million last
year, seventh in the league _ than the Astrodome generated in
revenue, the Astros put a championship-caliber team on the field.
But the years of deficit spending forced them to be the antithesis
of other clubs with new ballparks. Instead of bringing in
high-profile players, the Astros had to get rid of them.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hampton, a 22-game winner, was traded to the New York Mets.
Carl Everett, a 25-homer, 27-steal center fielder, went to the
Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The two players can become free agents after this season, and
even though projections show revenues increasing as much as 60
percent because of the move to Enron Field, the club couldn't
afford to keep them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent the money before we received it,'' Hunsicker said.
``As we move into the new stadium our revenues are going to
significantly increase, but our expenses have already exceeded our
revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Astros' divisional rivals improved.
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Reds, who won 96 games last season and finished a
game behind the Astros, added Ken Griffey Jr. The St. Louis
Cardinals rebuilt their pitching staff. The Chicago Cubs traded for
pitcher Ismael Valdes and second baseman Eric Young.
</P>
<P>
   Even the division's small-market clubs, the Pittsburgh Pirates
and Milwaukee Brewers, made moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``In sports, it's what have you done for me lately,'' Astros
second baseman Craig Biggio said. ``We've won the last three years,
but that's over with. This division has gotten better. Every team
in this division is better and has a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   A cursory analysis indicates the Astros, after replacing proven
stars Hampton and Everett with youngsters such as Octavio Dotel and
Roger Cedeno, aren't better. Thus, the trendy pick in the Central
this year is a team other than the defending champs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to be a way of life in Houston to be the underdog,''
Hunsicker said. ``Year in and year out, we don't seem to get a lot
of national recognition. People seem to underestimate what we're
doing. But we've found a way to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros were supposed to be headed for a down year in '98
after 19-game winner Darryl Kile departed as a free agent. Instead,
they won a club-record 102 games.
</P>
<P>
   They were supposed to slip again last season when they couldn't
re-sign Randy Johnson. They won 97 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we are again,'' Hunsicker said. ``They're down on us
again. Maybe this will be the year. You keep playing the red on a
roulette wheel, and sooner or later red is going to come up. It's
impossible to win every year. But we've certainly beat the odds
recently, and I have a lot of confidence in this ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   With good reason. Biggio is back, and so is first baseman Jeff
Bagwell. Biggio widely is considered the best second baseman in the
league, and Bagwell and Mark McGwire are considered the two best at
first.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros like the idea of the speedy Cedeno batting behind
Biggio at the top of the order, and they like the potential of a
right-field platoon with Richard Hidalgo and Daryle Ward.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, they feel they've added the equivalent of an impact free
agent with the return of left fielder Moises Alou, who batted .312
with 38 homers and 124 runs batted in during 1998 then missed last
season because of a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling about Alou is he's one of the premier players in
the game,'' manager Larry Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros expect Alou to more than compensate for the loss of
Everett, and for the offense to be as productive as any in the
division.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' cautioned Bagwell, ``offense is not the problem in this
division; it's pitching. Whoever pitches the best is going to win.
Everybody's going to score runs; everybody's going to hit home
runs. It's who's going to keep the opposition from scoring less.
That's going to be the key.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where the Astros could miss Hampton, who was 22-4 with a
2.90 earned-run average and threw 239 innings in 34 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing about Hampy is that's a lot of innings we
lost,'' Biggio said. ``That's the thing that's going to be hard to
replace. But somebody else is going to step up and fill the void.
That's kind of the way this team is. We'll go out there and deal
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   It would have been easier to deal with if revenue from the new
stadium had allowed the Astros to sign a free agent or two, or at
least keep the players they were forced to trade. Still, they're
not ready to concede the Central.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a good team,'' Biggio said. ``We have a chance,
and that's you can ask for when you break camp.''

MAKING HIS PITCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ The clubhouse jocularity is gone. In its
place is a serious, business approach. And the Dodgers hope also
returned is the focus that helped make Carlos Perez one of the
up-and-coming left-handers in the game when he was with Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   His arm angle is higher, and in his case, higher is better. The
velocity of his fastball has returned to the high 80s, his control
is improved and his physical condition is the best it's been in
years.
</P>
<P>
   But there is this other side of Perez. The side that breeds
skepticism. It can be described in many ways, but nothing
illustrates it like the numbers:
</P>
<P>
   Perez was 2-10 with a 7.43 ERA in the first year of a
three-year, $15.6 million contract. And he is owed $12.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're optimistic, but it's not blind optimism,'' said general
manager Kevin Malone, who signed Perez to the multiyear deal. ``The
optimism is based on real issues that have been addressed. One, his
request for help. Two, his humility. Three, the way he worked in
the offseason. Four would be his focus. Five would be the way he
pitched in winter ball and six is that he showed up here in good
shape with a great attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds pretty good. But how can you forget the 2-10 record with
a 7.43 ERA? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is not an ordinary spring training for a guy who has two
years left on a large contract. Perez isn't working to be ready at
the end of spring training. He needed to be ready two weeks ago,
when pitchers and catchers reported to camp. He is guaranteed
nothing, which is also what most people think he'll deliver.
Instead, all eyes are on Orel Hershiser, signed as a free agent
during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser was quickly assigned to the bullpen, insurance in case
Perez falters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to show my (butt) out there and everything will take
care of itself,'' Perez, 29, said. ``I'm fine. My mind is so clean.
It's what I need. I already forgot the past. They already paid for
it and I don't like to make money that way. I like to do my job. I
like to show what I've got. I feel happy when I win when my games.
I feel relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be happy because I make money. Money, to me,
doesn't mean (anything). I remember two years in a row when I made
$160,000 a year. Every time I would shove my (butt) on the mound I
was doing my job.''
</P>
<P>
   That was before Perez went 2-10 with a 7.43 ERA. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The primary reason for the optimism (other than it being spring
training) is based on reports from the Dodgers personnel who
visited Perez in the Dominican Republic during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Claude Osteen, assistant general manager Bill
Geivett, farm director Jerry Weinstein, senior vice president Tommy
Lasorda, senior scouting advisor Don Welke, pitching coordinator
Jim Benedict and strength and conditioning coordinator Todd
Claussen each met with Perez.
</P>
<P>
   According to all, Perez was pitching well, working hard and
intent on proving the club didn't make a mistake in signing him to
a three-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely see a difference and I think anybody will really
see a difference between last year and this year, just in terms of
his arm action and his delivery,'' Geivett said. ``He really looked
like he was pushing the ball a lot last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you're looking at a pitcher like this that's had a
very good amount of success at the major-league level, they're
going to go through some rocky times, or the guy's going to have a
bad year. This guy's shown what he can do at the major-league
level. It's just a matter of getting back to that. It's not like
this guy's never done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers catching prospect Angel Pena caught Perez last seaso and
said there's no comparison to how he threw in winter ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used the fastball more and nobody could touch it because
they were waiting for the changeup,'' Pena said. ``He threw the
fastball, inside, up and away, and he was doing great. The last
time he threw 92, 93. I looked to the guy with the (radar) gun and
said, `God.' `'
</P>
<P>
   Perez's fastball is average, at best, but his changeup and
split- finger fastball were so good with the Expos, it didn't
matter his fastball rarely broke 90 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the fastball reached 80 mph and made the changeup
ineffective, shattered his confidence and left him so frustrated he
pummeled a water cooler in the dugout after being taken out of a
game.
</P>
<P>
   It was a clip that was on every sportscast in North America but
not the only off-field news Perez made. He missed a start in May
because of a knee injury. He said he hurt the knee shagging fly
balls on Montreal's rock-hard artificial turf. The Dodgers thought
differently, particularly that Perez injured his knee when he fell
during a night on the town. Workers at the team hotel said Perez
didn't arrive until the early-morning hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I saw right away when I was in the Dominican is he's
much more focused,'' Osteen said. ``He looks better physically. I
know he's in better shape. I told him, 'You have to keep your focus
and keep your priorities in line. You've got one thing to do and
that's win a job.' I think he's pretty much resigned to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Is the 2-10 record with a 7.43 ERA starting to fade from your
memory? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perez said there are things he will do differently this season.
His hope is he's doing it for the Dodgers instead of the
Albuquerque Dukes.
</P>
<P>
   Amidst the failure, the flawed mechanics and the pressure to
perform on a club expected to contend for a title, Perez got
confused. His personal life was flying around twice the speed of
his fastball. He was readying for the birth of his second child and
his ineptness on the mound, coupled with his exorbitant contract,
had folks chirping in his ear constantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to stay away from some people. I want some people to
leave me alone, to let me work,'' said Perez. ``I'm not used to
having so many people all over when I wear my uniform. I'm growing
up, I'm learning at the same time. I think if they let me do my
stuff, like I'm supposed, I'll do good. I know people want to help
you, but when you need to concentrate, you need to concentrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough when you warm up in a bullpen to pitch in a game.
It's tough when you have somebody around you and they tell you some
stuff. I never saw that and I don't want to see that. After I
finish a game, they can come to me and tell me how to do this, how
to do this. I've already talked with some people here. Things are
going to be different.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter where he turns, Perez will hear it. Even if he has a
scoreless, even hitless, spring, 1999 is always lurking. In case
you haven't heard, Perez was 2-10 with a 7.43 ERA. It'll take a
while for anyone to forget it.

 PLAYING WITHOUT PAIN, MARSHALL HOPES TO
REGAIN FORM (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By JEFF
CAPLAN c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The clock is ticking on Grant Marshall's season. But
now, for the first span since last season's NHL Western Conference
finals, time might be on his side.
</P>
<P>
   On the lonesome road to recovery from two groin injuries,
Marshall is finally playing pain free. It has taken nine grueling
months. In Game 7 of the conference finals, he tore his left groin,
which agonizingly forced him out of the Stanley Cup Finals and the
first four games of this season. Two games into his return,
Marshall shredded his right groin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a bit of a write-off year when it comes to my
body, but hopefully there is a turnaround coming down the
stretch,'' said Marshall, who has four points, all assists, in 30
games. He has posted three assists in the past four games but has a
plus-minus rating of minus-8.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Ken Hitchcock can live with few points from Marshall. What
Hitchcock needs is the return of the abrasive and brash play he
demands from his fifth-year checking right winger. Last season,
Marshall played in all 82 games and was named the team's
most-improved player. He set career highs in games, goals and
points while improving his role as the team's on-ice lightning rod.
</P>
<P>
   But, a groin injury can zap a player, and Marshall has been
dealing with two of them. The injury can hamper everything from
fighting off checks to chasing loose pucks to outracing opponents.
It all spirals downward to diminishing physical play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, it's got to be tough because you want to do a lot
more things than you can when your body tells you no,'' center Mike
Modano said. ``The groin is such a key thing for skaters and hockey
players in general. He'll be a key guy when he's healthy and really
strong for us down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the demand for Marshall to regain his aggressive, physical
form is there now. Marshall's job description calls for him to draw
the undivided attention of his opponents on every shift. When he
does that, he creates time and space for his linemates.
</P>
<P>
   Those are Hitchcock's demands. Demands the coach said Marshall
has been slow to fulfill.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see Grant Marshall at the top of his game, it's when
you know that the other team is reacting to what he's doing on the
ice. They're having to pay special attention to him as a physical
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what the team needs for us to win. He has to have the
other team looking over their shoulder, worried about him where he
is on the ice, reckless. That's the type of player we need. I don't
think he's there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall wants to disagree, but he has no argument to the
contrary.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my role and lately I think I've been doing that pretty
good,'' he said. ``I've missed so many games due to my groin
injuries, but you know he's \RHitchcock is\S right. I've got to
compete. I've got to battle. I've got to make sure they know that
when they get hit they're going to be in for a war. I'm playing
better, I'm slowly coming, but I've got a ways to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Time is ticking and Marshall isn't naive. He knows forwards Joe
Nieuwendyk, Jere Lehtinen and Brian Skrudland are expected back in
the lineup by playoff time. The addition of players also
necessitates subtraction.
</P>
<P>
   Time ran out on him last season. With 19 games remaining,
Marshall has ample time, who of late has played on the fourth line
with Aaron Gavey and Jamie Wright, to excavate his complete game
for another run at the Stanley Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I went through with my groin is very frustrating. Guys
bug me a little bit about not scoring, and they know I'm trying,
I'm working hard,'' Marshall said. ``You've got to prove yourself
every night, but I'm not worried. I know that this team needs me.
I'm going to make sure I have my spot, and, if I don't, then I'll
work hard to get it back.''

HEAT STUN KNICKS, 85-76 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It was late in the New York Knicks' blissful first
quarter, when they were making off with the milk money of the Miami
Heat, a team turned weakling without Alonzo Mourning, and a loose
ball trickled toward the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Childs gave a half-hearted chase, bent halfway to reach
it, and watched it skip out of bounds. It was hard to manufacture
desperation when the Knicks were on their way to a 20-point lead
early in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was so easy, it was too easy. After the Knicks rubbed
their hands together as if sitting down for a feast in the first
quarter, they finished looking like full-bellied diners as players
like the aging Dan Majerle _ bad back and all _ tossed their bodies
on the floor for loose balls.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Heat found inspiration in its effort and determination
from its defense, it unearthed a 20-7 run in the closing minutes of
the second quarter and took the lead for good in the closing split
second of the third. The dramatic twist in this game left the
Knicks in disbelief as they exited the American Airlines Arena with
a 85-76 loss to Miami, which was without Mourning and Voshon
Lenard.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first quarter, no one played well offensively,''
Coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``I give the Heat a lot of credit. We
have been struggling since the All-Star break, and tonight was no
different. Anyone that thought it was going to be easy when we have
a 20-point lead was kidding themselves. But obviously, I still
thought we were going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed unfathomable, but Latrell Sprewell had seven
turnovers, and Allan Houston made just 5 of 13 shots around Majerle
and Bruce Bowen. It seemed unthinkable, but P.J. Brown held Patrick
Ewing to just 8 points and Kurt Thomas allowed Clarence
Weatherspoon to grab 12 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The defense of Tim Hardaway (3 steals), the offense of Jamal
Mashburn (24 points) and bench production of Weatherspoon (14
points) brought about the Knicks' collapse. The Knicks, who began
shooting 61.9 percent in the first quarter, ended the game by
hitting just 18 of their last 63 shots. Another lead blown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we kind of relaxed a little bit, but they just
out-worked us tonight,'' said Houston, who finished with 15 points.
``I think that's what it came down to. They played hard, got the
loose balls and made the extra effort. That's how they got back
into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Knicks never responded. Not one star came through.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played terrible,'' said Ewing, who was 3 for 10. ``We won
the first quarter, and they won the rest of the game. They made
everything tough for us. And we didn't do the same at the other
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough loss. I'm disappointed that we lost because this
is a game we should have won. We stopped playing and they didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were faced with the Heat, a team led by Hardaway and
Majerle. This was the core of the Heat's firepower, two superstars
on the downside of their careers. They were the ones who had to
make up for the 34 points per game Mourning and Lenard contribute
nightly.
</P>
<P>
   In the game's opening 14 minutes, the Knicks had no sympathy for
them. They had their own injuries _ with Marcus Camby and Charlie
Ward having missed the last three weeks _ and had managed.
Suddenly, it was obvious which team had the safety net built into
the roster.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks could lean on Kurt Thomas, John Wallace, Chris Childs
for support. Pat Riley stared down at his spare parts and saw Bowen
_ fresh off the waiver wire _ Anthony Carter and Duane Causwell.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the Knicks were merciless in attacking the depleted
Heat. Demoralizing Mashburn, Larry Johnson hit his first five shots
and scored 13 first-quarter points while Thomas and Sprewell took
turns getting their offense together. By the time the second
quarter was 3 minutes old, the Knicks had a gaudy 20-point lead and
were on their way to an uncommonly easy victory in a back-to-back
game situation.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Heat started to intensify its effort on defense, and
the whole game changed. The Miami players were double-teaming and
putting pressure on the ball, hovering and putting a body on their
man, en route to a 1-point lead at the end of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were stunned. From the three-minute mark of the third
quarter until 10 minutes were left in the fourth, the Knicks missed
11 shots in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat started a 20-7 run in the second quarter while the
Knicks seemed blissfully unaware that their lead was being chopped
to bits. After shooting 61.9 percent in the first quarter, the
Knicks were held to just 25 percent in the second quarter. After
taking such a commanding lead, the Knicks were hanging on to a
43-37 lead at the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks needed one star _ any star _ to come through. How
about Ewing? He was either exhausted by his second game in two
nights or suffering a letdown without Mourning to inspire that
Georgetown kick. Houston was having trouble getting a good look and
Sprewell going two possessions without a turnover.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had to throw out the life preserver to the Knicks. He
sprang free of Mashburn for his seventh point of the third quarter
when he delivered a timely 3-pointer after the Heat had cut the
Knicks' lead to 3 points on Mashburn's jumper. Johnson gave the
Knicks a 60-54 lead with 3 minutes left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But the Heat came back to take the lead by the end of the period
and went on from there to bury the Knicks. &QL;

 TUBBS ISN'T READY TO TRY RETIREMENT (For
use by NYTimes News Service clients) By JIM REEVES c.2000 Fort
Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ You're 63, or 64, or maybe even 65 years old
_ you're darn sure not telling because you've learned, by now, that
what you say can and almost always will be used against you _ and
the only thing you've ever done, only thing you've ever wanted to
do, is coach basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Oh sure, everybody knows Billy Tubbs loves to play golf, but
who's kidding who? It's hardly the same, you know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends who should know tell me golf is not nearly as fun when
you can do it anytime you want to,'' you're always telling folks
who ask why you don't just walk away from all the aggravation and
spend the rest of your life on the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   And danged if it doesn't seem like every other person is
suddenly asking that question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only thing anybody wants to talk about these days,'' you tell
a visitor who drops by your office one day last week. ``Shoot, I
can't imagine not coaching, not doing anything. Even worse, my wife
can't imagine it either.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, since when has Billy Tubbs ever walked ``away'' from
aggravation?
</P>
<P>
   You've always been the aggravator, never the ``aggravatee.''
You're the straw that stirs the stink, and proud of it. Mellowing
in your old age? Forget about it. Smarter maybe, but hardly mellow.
``Never'' mellow.
</P>
<P>
   You're preening a bit in your office in a new golf shirt,
sucking in what gut you have, which isn't much, ready to tell
anyone who wants to listen that the world looks the same through
your eyes, which, in case anyone's wondering, remain cataract free.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still get my thousand miles a year in running,'' you point
out, tossing the challenge on the coffee table casually, as if to
say, ``And how many miles did you run today, friend?''
</P>
<P>
   So why is everybody suddenly so interested in how much longer
your contract runs? Since when has that ever been a big deal in
your six years at TCU?
</P>
<P>
   OK, you say, let's lay all the cards on the table. You've heard
the rumors, the ones that hint that Billy Tubbs will finish out his
contract _ and how long that runs is another state secret; ``two or
three more years,'' you say casually _ and then walk off into the
sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever started that rumor, though, obviously didn't run it by
you first. The question that has to be in your mind, though you
don't come right out and voice it, is whether or not it originated
in the athletic director's office.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't helped that athletic director Eric Hyman basically
refuses to discuss your situation at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be the TCU coach as long as TCU wanted me to be the
coach,'' you say vaguely. ``If TCU didn't want me to be the coach,
then I don't want to be the coach.''
</P>
<P>
   And why wouldn't TCU want you to be the coach? Sure, your Frogs
(16-13) are winding down an un-Tubbs-like season, but this will be
the first time in four years that your team hasn't won 20 games and
you've still never had a losing season since coming to TCU in
1994-95.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't matter. You keep score a little differently than most
folks. For Billy Tubbs, this is a bad year. Period. No excuses. You
began thinking about how to make it better next year a long time
ago.
</P>
<P>
   But these rumors aren't about performance. They're about
comfort. When the new administration _ new president, new athletic
director _ came in two years ago, there were changes, some subtle,
some not so subtle.
</P>
<P>
   The comfort level that was there with the old regime
disappeared. This isn't particularly unusual. You've been through
changes like this before. Philosophies change, you shrug, and where
you fit into the grand scheme of things can change, too.
</P>
<P>
   A new AD comes in, he's naturally thinking about putting his own
people into place. You did the same thing with a whole new staff of
assistant coaches when you arrived at TCU. Had nothing to do with
how the previous assistants had performed. You just wanted people
you knew and were comfortable with.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, just maybe, you're not Hyman's kind of coach. Certainly
he has never sat you down and told you that you were. Maybe the
Tubbs in-your-face, smart-mouth style of coaching makes him
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   If this seems a little ungrateful, considering the state of
Horned Frog basketball when you came here, and the fact that you
basically put TCU back onto the athletic map long before football
``wunderkind'' Dennis Franchione arrived on the scene, that's not
something you fret about. Or at least that's what you'd have
everyone believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need pats on the back or somebody to make over me,''
you half-growl when the subject of appreciation comes up. ``I
search myself out, and I know when I'm doing things right and when
I've made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to feel comfortable within yourself about anything
that goes on. I know whether I'm doing right or doing my best. I
don't need somebody running around, jacking me up all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, this unsettled feeling that's been hanging around lately
has gotten so strong, you've actually thought about leaving to
coach somewhere else. Not quit, mind you. But to keep coaching
somewhere else ...
</P>
<P>
   It's just that you and wife Pat both love TCU and Fort Worth so
much. Leaving at this stage is really the last thing you want to
do.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, taking TCU into Conference USA after the 2001 season is
the kind of challenge Billy Tubbs has always relished. This step
will be the biggest TCU has ever made, and you wonder if everyone
else even begins to realize the difficulties that lay ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a conference that could produce a national
champion,'' you whisper, as if afraid a spy might be eavesdropping
outside the door.
</P>
<P>
   You pause a moment, thinking this next thought out carefully, as
if afraid that saying it aloud might somehow jinx it. But what the
heck. It's not like you've ever been afraid to say what's on your
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't see that I have to put a limit that I'm only
going to coach so many years,'' you say, circling back to the
original question. ``But if I do, then here's my limit: If we win
the national tournament, I'm through.''
</P>
<P>
   Now how could anybody argue with that?

 PITCHING AIDS TEXAS CLIMB IN POLLS (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) By WHIT CANNING c.2000 Fort Worth
Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Among other achievements in a long and
distinguished career, Texas baseball coach Augie Garrido has become
a master of the thought-enhancing deadpan response.
</P>
<P>
   So, Augie, do you really plan to maintain this 2.05 staff
earned-run average throughout the entire season?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, of course, Garrido also notes that the season has
31/2 months remaining ... assuming that you intend to still be
playing in June, when the College World Series opens. Many a
capricious wind will blow between now and then, but for now the
Texas pitching staff looks like a fistful of aces.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: When the Longhorns (13-3, 3-0 Big 12) completed a
three-game sweep of Iowa State with a 4-0 victory Sunday behind
Phil Seibel (4-0), it was the staff's fourth shutout of the season.
The last time a Texas team had that many was when the 1994 team
managed five over a full season.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in the seventh, Seibel gave way to closer Charlie
Thames, who picked up a win and two saves last week. Thames (2-0)
now has five saves and a 0.00 ERA over 221/3 innings, allowing 13
hits, two walks, an unearned run, and racking up 19 strikeouts.
Opponents are hitting .169 against him.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Texas won, 7-1, behind Beau Hale, who has already
pitched a no-hitter this year. But Garrido liked the Saturday game,
when D.J. Jones got roughed up a little but the Longhorns won
anyway, 13-5. There was a nice contribution from sophomore
pitcher-outfielder Ryan France, who made his first college homer a
grand slam and went 4-for-4 with six runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to win games in different ways now, and that's
encouraging,'' Garrido said. ``We're playing defense well, and
we're more productive with the bats.''
</P>
<P>
   A key figure in both areas is junior second baseman Tommy
Nicholson, who is hitting .410 and has a 1.000 fielding average on
77 chances. Career-wise, he has seven errors in his past 390
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Ranked fourth and eighth in the two major polls, Texas will prep
for a weekend series at Missouri with a journey to Houston tonight
to face the Cougars (13-3), who are ranked third and fifth and
outscored LSU, 31-11, in a three-game sweep in Baton Rouge over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they're looking forward to getting us in a
Cougar-friendly environment,'' said Garrido, whose team won two of
three from UH earlier in the year in Austin. The mound assignment
will go to Dax Leone who was Texas' most effective pitcher down the
stretch last year but is trying to overcome a sore arm.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor (11-3, 2-1) is also strong on the hill and ranked fifth
and 16th after winning two of three from Oklahoma State last
weekend. Chad Hawkins pitched a complete game in the opener, giving
up three hits, walking one and striking out nine but losing a 2-1
duel to preseason All-American Matt Smith. All three runs were
unearned. A 13-1 Baylor victory in the second game was halted by
the 12-run rule after seven innings, with the win going to Kyle
Evans (4-0). The Bears won the third game, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M (8-7, 3-0) collected 41 hits and 37 runs in a
three-game sweep of Kansas State as Jason Gremminger went 6-for-9
with three homers and 11 RBI. The Aggies will face the Bears this
weekend, with the Friday game scheduled to be played in College
Station and the Saturday-Sunday games in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Still missing staff ace Brandon Roberson, who is rehabilitating
an injured arm, Texas Tech (8-8, 1-2) dropped two of three at home
to Missouri. About the only place the Raiders aren't hurting is the
third spot in the batting order, where designated hitter Chaz
Eiguren is hitting .500 (31-of-62) with seven home runs, 33 RBI and
a .952 slugging percentage. Over the past four games, he has hit
.619 with five homers and 16 RBI.

 RANGERS SIGN TWO CUBAN INFIELDERS (For use
by NYTimes News Service clients) By T.R. SULLIVAN c.2000 Fort Worth
Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ The Rangers took a plunge into the
potentially lucrative Cuban baseball market yesterday by signing
infielders Jorge Diaz and Osmani Garcia. Both defected from Cuba in
1998 and were members of the Cuban national team. Diaz, a second
baseman who turns 25 on March 16, is much closer to the major
leagues. He signed a Triple-A contract with a $50,000 bonus and was
invited to big-league camp. The Rangers say he could be their
starting second baseman at Triple A and play in the majors later
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pretty close,'' Rangers scouting director Chuck McMichael
said. ``He does all the things you'd want from a second baseman.''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz, who is hoping to get his work visa and be here by the
middle of next week, played with the Cuban national team from
1995-97 and spent five seasons in the National Series, Cuba's
regular season. He had a career batting average of .283 and is
considered an above-average defensive player, McMichael said.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, a 25-year-old third baseman who received a $25,000
bonus, played in the National Series for five seasons and with the
national team in 1997. He was a career .300 hitter and was the
league MVP in 1995. The Rangers want him to start at Class A and
develop some power.
</P>
<P>
   The two players left Cuba by boat in 1998 and went to Nicaragua
but were denied residency. They were granted residency in Costa
Rica last February and have been working out in the Dominican
Republic since October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both are very hungry and eager to prove they can play,''
McMichael said.
</P>
<P>
   The signings aren't considered on the same level as the New York
Yankees signing Orlando Hernandez or the Tampa Bay Devil Rays
signing Rolando Arrojo. But it's the first time the Rangers have
signed former players from the Cuban national team. McMichael said
at least five other teams were competing for their services
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows me something, that we were able to get some guys
that everyone else wanted,'' said first baseman Rafael Palmeiro,
who was born in Cuba and follows that country's baseball program.
``It shows we're trying to do the best we can to stay competitive
with other teams.''
Rogers takes lead Rangers manager Johnny Oates isn't ready to
announce his Opening Day starter, but he has put Kenny Rogers in
that position. Oates said yesterday Rogers will start Friday in the
exhibition opener against the Minnesota Twins.
</P>
<P>
   Oates has set up his spring training to have Rogers lead the
way, followed by Rick Helling on Saturday against the Cincinnati
Reds, Darren Oliver on Sunday against the Reds and Esteban Loaiza
on Monday against the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Perisho and Mark Clark, the leading candidates to fill in
for Justin Thompson as the fifth starter, are scheduled to pitch
Tuesday against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Rogers follows them and
precedes Helling, which puts him in position to be the Rangers' No.
1 starter.
Hoping for Oliva Former Cincinnati Reds slugger Tony Perez will be
the first Cuban-born player in the Hall of Fame when he's inducted
this summer. Rafael Palmeiro is hoping for a second one today when
the Veteran's Committee considers former Twins outfielder Tony
Oliva.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm an Oliva guy,'' Palmeiro said. ``He won some batting
titles in his time. I'm not aware of his career numbers, but, from
everything I heard, he should be in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thrilled when Tony got in. He waited a long time, and
you're not sure how people will look at him. But I was hoping he'd
get in.''
Venafro throws Rangers reliever Mike Venafro, sidelined with a
strained ligament in his left middle finger, began throwing again
yesterday. Venafro was able to keep the finger from bothering him
by taping it tightly to the index finger.
</P>
<P>
   Venafro is hoping to throw off a mound next week and be ready to
pitch by Opening Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The year after the strike, pitchers had just three weeks to
get ready,'' Venafro said. ``We still have five weeks, so I should
be all right.''

   BERLIN _ The Austrian far-right leader Joerg Haider stunned
political friends and foes alike by announcing Monday that he
wanted to step down as leader of the Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
   Haider told allies he had grown tired of international
criticism, and would henceforth concentrate on his job as governor
of the southern province of Carinthia. He suggested that Susanne
Riess-Passer, vice-chancellor in the new government that has
provoked fury abroad and mass demonstrations on the streets of
Vienna, should succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom Party executive met Monday night to discuss their
leader's latest flamboyant gesture, which took even them by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Haider said the government he had worked so hard to build was in
danger from the ``prejudices'' his personality was attracting. It
also made sense, he added, that a member of the new government
should be entrusted with the leadership of the party.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no danger of Haider, the most successful politician
in postwar Austria, disappearing. His retreat is likely to prove a
tactical gambit.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, who turned 50 last month, has never concealed his
ambition of becoming chancellor of Austria one day. Asked in an
interview Monday if he had given up that dream because of the odium
heaped upon him in recent weeks, Haider replied: ``Why? It's become
even more likely.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanishing from the rough and tumble of national politics for a
while serves this long-term strategy. A stint in government should
make the Freedom Party more respectable, but possibly at the risk
of its own popularity.
</P>
<P>
   None of the xenophobic election slogans are likely to become
reality, but a lot of difficult decisions will have to be taken as
the coalition tries to grapple with an overregulated economy.
Already the Freedom Party is dropping in the polls, and ministers
have started bickering among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Haider will sit out these troubled times in his provincial power
base, nurturing his political virginity, and awaiting the moment
when he can return to Vienna as savior.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, his grip on the party is assured. Haider took
over the then-fringe party with a voter base of five percent 13
years ago, and has turned it into the second biggest political
force in Austria. In elections last October, it gained 27 percent
of the votes.
</P>
<P>
   Without him, as everybody knows, the Freedom Party would sink
back into oblivion. Whatever his title, Haider remains the
undisputed leader. &QL;

   VIRGINIA BEACH _ Senator John McCain dramatically turned up the
heat in the battle for the Republican presidential nomination
Monday, attacking the influential religious right as hypocrites in
a speech described as ``astounding'' and ``epoch-making.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a rapturous audience at the Frank W. Cox High School
in Virginia Beach, Va., on the eve of three crucial Republican
primaries, McCain threw down the gauntlet to his rival for the
party's presidential nomination, George W. Bush, and reiterated his
claim to the political legacy of Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends, I am a Reagan Republican who will defeat Al
Gore,'' he said to deafening applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately'' _ he went on, as the audience rose to its feet
_ ``Governor Bush is a Pat Robertson Republican who will lose to Al
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, the leader of the Christian Coalition, allied himself
with Bush at the start of the presidential campaign and has made
recorded phone calls to voters in several key primary states,
casting doubts on McCain's conservative credentials. Virginia Beach
is Robertson's base of operations.
</P>
<P>
   In words that sounded not just like a bid for his party's
nomination, but like a bid for the presidency, McCain said
``neither party should be defined by pandering to the outer reaches
of American politics and the agents of intolerance, whether they be
Louis Farrakhan or Al Sharpton (black activists) on the left or Pat
Robertson or Jerry Falwell on the right.''
</P>
<P>
   (Falwell, a television evangelist, distinguished himself last
year by condemning the Tellytubbies toys for encouraging a gay
lifestyle because Tinky Winky carries a handbag.)
</P>
<P>
   McCain also set out to seize the high ground of Republican
conservatism from Bush, using the word ``conservative'' no fewer
than 16 times in his 15 minutes speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a pro-life, pro-family, fiscal conservative and advocate
of a strong defense,'' he said. ``And yet, Pat Robertson, Jerry
Falwell and a few Washington leaders of the pro-life movement call
me an unacceptable presidential candidate. They distort my pro-life
positions and smear the reputation of my supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican senator from Arizona was making his one and only
campaign speech in Virginia on the eve of today's (Tuesday's)
primary in the state, at the start of a day which would take him
across the United States from east to west via North Dakota and
Washington State and on to California.
</P>
<P>
   North Dakota and Washington hold caucuses and a primary today
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Until three weeks ago, Bush had been forecast to win an easy
victory in Virginia, a relatively conservative state, and McCain
had had no plans to campaign here.
</P>
<P>
   This changed after McCain's victory in Michigan last week, and
Monday's speech in Virginia Beach reflected a last-minute decision
to make one major campaign appearance in a state where polls show
the two men in a close race. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ If you know Madeleine Albright, you will also know
that the notion of her becoming the next president of the Czech
Republic is both absurd and utterly logical.
</P>
<P>
   You will also know that this is not the last you will hear about
it. She is a politician, after all, and she has been slipping from
the limelight of late.
</P>
<P>
   It is not as if the idea is new. They have been bouncing it
around the political parlors of Washington for over a year.
</P>
<P>
   Albright can never be president of the United States _ the
Constitution reserves tenancy of the White House to those born in
America _ so why not of somewhere else?
</P>
<P>
   Once during her tenure as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations,
during President Bill Clinton's first term, Albright joked that
there was a 16th member of the Security Council. She said it was
CNN.
</P>
<P>
   She understands the power of the media. She also knows how
important it is for her to court its attention. So let us gossip
about her moving to the presidential castle in Prague for awhile.
It will do her no harm.
</P>
<P>
   Prague is where she was born, on May 15, 1937. She was Madlenka
Korbelova, the daughter of a Czech diplomat Josef Korbel and his
wife, Mandula. She was barely out of diapers when Munich happened
and the rest of western Europe stood aside as Hitler invaded her
land. The family fled to London for the rest of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   When Germany was defeated, the Korbel clan returned to Prague
where Josef seemed on course to become his country's foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it was Stalin who got in the way and when Communism
conquered Czechoslovakia, Korbel took himself and his family to the
United States of America. It was 1948. He became a lecturer at the
University of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The ``refugee girl'' image has never harmed Albright's public
standing. Always gripped by politics and political history _
particularly the history of Eastern Europe _ she eventually became
a professor herself at Georgetown University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   She also cultivated ties with the Democratic Party and many of
its leading figures. One of these was Bill Clinton, who gave her
the U.N. job, and brought her to Washington as secretary of state
in 1997. She is the first woman to hold such high office in the
United States. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrives
in Prague next week on a trip that many in the Czech capital see as
a declaration of interest in the country's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Czech-born Albright is being touted as a possible replacement
for Vaclav Havel, whose term of office ends in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   President Havel, a former dissident turned playwright, was the
leader of the 1989 Velvet Revolution that toppled the Communist
regime and has become the country's best-known ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from Havel, who retains immense admiration both at home
and abroad for his moral qualities, the perpetual squabbling and
infighting of most Czech politicians has left them in low esteem
with the public and there are no obvious successors to him.
</P>
<P>
   Havel told Albright a year and a half ago that he wanted her to
replace him, according to a report in Time magazine Monday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials denied that Albright, who speaks fluent Czech,
was interested in the post. She has been approached several times
by senior officials of her native land as a potential presidential
candidate, but has always refused, said her spokesman, James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has dismissed it, although she is certainly flattered that
that the Czechs would consider her for the post of president of her
native land. She has never given this serious consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   With three years of President Havel's term left to run, it's too
early to consider the U.S. secretary of state as a serious
presidential candidate, said Prague-based sociologist Ivan Gabal,
who has met her several times.
</P>
<P>
   Still there is nationwide goodwill towards Albright, both for
her Czech origins and because of her role in integrating the
central European nation into NATO. The Czech Republic, together
with Hungary and Poland, joined the alliance last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is definitely a serious person, but it's not on the agenda
yet. She is known here as the U.S. secretary of state, but not as
someone who would run for presidential office.
</P>
<P>
   ``But she is perceived positively here, as a sympathetic person
because she understands our position in central Europe and very
much helped bring us into NATO,'' said Gabal.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Zantovsky, former Czech ambassador to Washington, said
in Prague that he met last week with Havel and discussed, among
other things, the possibility that Albright might run to succeed
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never made it a secret that I think that Madeleine Albright
could, one day in the future, play a big role in Czech politics,''
Zantovsky said. He stressed that the idea is not new and that it
would not dominate Albright's agenda in the Czech Republic next
week.
</P>
<P>
   In Prague, Havel's chief-policy adviser, Pavel Fischer, told
Time magazine that the idea could be on the agenda: ``It is not
impossible that they will talk about this.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Czech constitution, the president needs to be a
Czech citizen. As Albright was born in the former Czechoslovakia,
to Czech parents, she would have to reclaim her citizenship, which
would be likely to be granted. &QL;

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair's fresh skepticism
about GM (genetically-modified) foods was bolstered Monday by
claims that the U.S. government has covered up the safety fears of
its own scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations will support public concerns, acknowledged by
Blair in an article for The Independent on Sunday over the weekend,
that GM foods are potentially harmful.
</P>
<P>
   Internal documents from Washington's food safety agency indicate
U.S. government scientists advised against the assumption that GM
crops are as safe as ones developed by traditional methods.
</P>
<P>
   The assumption of ``substantive equivalence,'' made by the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA), means GM foods face less stringent
testing than, for example, genetically-modified drugs.
</P>
<P>
   It has allowed the speedy commercialization of GM crops through
the U.S., with some products reaching the U.K. market without
further safety checks.
</P>
<P>
   One of the FDA scientists, Dr. Linda Kahl, said the agency was
trying to force the conclusion that the two seed-breeding methods
are equivalent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process of genetic engineering and traditional breeding
are different, and according to the technical experts in the
agency, they lead to different risks,'' she said in a memo.
</P>
<P>
   The documents with her comments, and those of other FDA
scientists, were disclosed during a lawsuit demanding tougher
testing, led by Steven Druker, a public-interest lawyer, who Monday
accused the FDA of ``shoddy'' safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   Druker is attending this week's conference in Edinburgh on GM
food safety sponsored by the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development.
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``The FDA's own scientists warned that genetic
modification may generate unexpected toxic carcinogens, allergens
and anti-nutritive substances in foods that were not being tested
for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet the agency covered that up and said it had no information
that GM foods differed in any way from other foods.''
</P>
<P>
   Druker's claims were rejected by the OECD. Patrick Kearns of the
OECD's health and safety department, said: ``Substantive
equivalence is part of a safety assessment. It is about a standard
of safety that means what we are looking for is a similar level of
safety to normal food.''
</P>
<P>
   But he refused to rule out the possibility that GM foods had
created new toxins and carcinogens which were potentially harmful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everything in the world is possible. We have to think
about what is reasonably possible and what is unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   Druker's concerns were backed by mainstream scientists within
the conference, which has brought together 400 GM experts with the
aim of reaching a consensus that can then advise a G7 summit of the
world's leading industrialized nations in Japan in July.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Mowlam, Britain's cabinet office minister, told the
conference she rejected claims that the prime minister had
performed a U-turn on GM safety. ``What we have always said is
there are potentially harmful effects,'' she said. &QL;

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just two hours after learning to his evident
amazement that his presidential ambitions were still alive, thanks
to the voters of straitlaced Michigan, Senator John McCain issued a
curious appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't fear my campaign, fellow Republicans,'' he pleaded,
``join it, join it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since that enchanted Tuesday evening, he has travelled the
length of the West Coast, from Seattle to San Diego, preparing for
the next set of primaries, this week and next, when the fate of his
self-styled crusade will once again be on the line. And those words
have resonated in his wake.
</P>
<P>
   To his opponent, the party establishment's favorite, George W.
Bush, they were a welcome cause for ridicule. What sort of a
Republican candidate is it that has to reach out to his fellow
Republicans?, he quipped at every campaign stop.
</P>
<P>
   His point was that John McCain had won the Michigan and New
Hampshire primaries courtesy of thousands of registered Democrats
and non-party voters who had crossed party lines to vote in a
Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   A good half of the voters in Michigan were not Republicans and
it was they who gave McCain his victory.
</P>
<P>
   A disconsolate Bush camp spent last week accusing him of
everything from ``borrowing'' Democrats to ``hijacking the
Republican primary.''
</P>
<P>
   However, mindful of the truth _ articulated on occasion by
McCain _ that only 40 percent of all U.S. voters are Republicans
and that anyone who wants to be president must appeal across party
lines, Bush formulated an appeal of his own, calling on
``Republicans and like-minded independents'' to support him.
</P>
<P>
   As the primaries progress, the Bush team calculates that the
threat from what McCain has termed ``the McCain majority'' will
fade. They look forward to the coming primaries where only
Republicans may vote.
</P>
<P>
   With the party hierarchy at national and local level still
firmly behind their candidate, they reckon that Bush will be home
and dry with the presidential nomination before the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   Accepted wisdom has it that if he is to prevent Bush taking the
nomination, McCain needs to capture the party mainstream.
Thereafter he can, and must, make broader alliances, but for now
his problem is winning over the rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   His proliferating references to the legacy of Ronald Reagan in
recent days suggest that he already has his sights on that
traditional, Republican constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Yet McCain's sweeping victory in the Arizona primary, which was
``closed'' to all but registered Republicans, suggests that where
he is well-known (Arizona is his home state) and where he is
running expressly against the local party establishment (the
governor and her administration backed Bush), the personal
supersedes the political.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, an analysis of McCain's support _ extrapolated
from exit polls in the states that have so far voted and augmented
by local apocrypha _ suggests he may not be so far removed from the
mainstream as the Bush camp likes to think, especially after Bush's
turn to the right to win South Carolina's primary .
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, those voters _ independent, Democrat and even
Republican _ who cast their ballot for McCain gave many reasons for
their choice.
</P>
<P>
   They included a desire to get back at the fervently pro-Bush
state governor over entirely local grievances, as well as an
aversion to being told by the governor how to vote, and dislike or
disapproval of Bush for his high birth and perceived shallowness.
</P>
<P>
   But the main reason people said they voted for McCain was the
same reason people gave in New Hampshire and elsewhere: because
they like him.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush camp has tried to use McCain's supposed unpopularity in
the Senate and in Arizona's political circles to argue that ``the
better people know Mr. McCain the less they like him.'' But the
impression from the campaign trail so far is quite the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   The more the voters see of McCain, the more his poll ratings
rise; conversely, the more they see of Bush, the less they like
him.
</P>
<P>
   His personal appeal is partly to do with his past as a Vietnam
war hero; but this would count for little without his authority on
the stump and the direct way he connects with his audiences, live
or on television.
</P>
<P>
   TV cameramen have described him as a ``dream,'' someone with
``no bad angles.'' Live, he galvanizes his audiences as none of the
other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   As he has become better known, both the gender and age gaps
among voters have also closed.
</P>
<P>
   Until Michigan, Bush _ who has allegedly adopted a specifically
female-friendly vocabulary _ took a majority of the women's vote.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, though, which is more of a microcosm of America
than any state that has voted so far, McCain took 53 percent of the
women's vote, compared with 41 percent for Bush. He led among male
voters, too.
</P>
<P>
   Young people are turning out for McCain in droves and their
comments are especially illuminating, given the perpetual
complaints of political commentators about the apathy of the
under-25s.
</P>
<P>
   This group finds McCain ``genuine,'' ``authentic'' and someone
worthy of their respect, who does not indulge in the double-speak
or image-switching they have grown used to from politicians.
</P>
<P>
   That they do not subscribe to all his policies, on abortion, for
instance, bothers them not a whit; they just think he would make a
good president. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Just two hours after learning to his evident
amazement that his presidential ambitions were still alive, thanks
to the voters of straitlaced Michigan, Senator John McCain issued a
curious appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't fear my campaign, fellow Republicans,'' he pleaded,
``join it, join it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since that enchanted Tuesday evening, he has travelled the
length of the West Coast, from Seattle to San Diego, preparing for
the next set of primaries, this week and next, when the fate of his
self-styled crusade will once again be on the line. And those words
have resonated in his wake.
</P>
<P>
   To his opponent, the party establishment's favorite, George W.
Bush, they were a welcome cause for ridicule. What sort of a
Republican candidate is it that has to reach out to his fellow
Republicans?, he quipped at every campaign stop.
</P>
<P>
   His point was that John McCain had won the Michigan and New
Hampshire primaries courtesy of thousands of registered Democrats
and non-party voters who had crossed party lines to vote in a
Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   A good half of the voters in Michigan were not Republicans and
it was they who gave McCain his victory.
</P>
<P>
   A disconsolate Bush camp spent last week accusing him of
everything from ``borrowing'' Democrats to ``hijacking the
Republican primary.''
</P>
<P>
   However, mindful of the truth _ articulated on occasion by
McCain _ that only 40 percent of all U.S. voters are Republicans
and that anyone who wants to be president must appeal across party

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TBLISI, GEORGIA _ In the snow-covered mountains of northern
Georgia soldiers can hear the roar of battle across the border in
Chechnya creeping gradually towards them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are worried that the Russians will push the Chechen
fighters into Georgia,'' said a Georgian official in Tblisi, the
Georgian capital.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, the fragile republic of five million people on the
southern slopes of the Caucasus Mountains, is trying hard to keep
out of the Chechen war.
</P>
<P>
   It has strenuously denied Russian claims that Chechen guerrillas
regularly cross its 50-mile-long border with Chechnya, bringing in
supplies and reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
   A weary-looking Georgian President Edouard Shevardnadze told The
Independent Saturday ``we are doing everything we can to avoid
getting involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Shevardnadze said that it was Russia's responsibility to police
the border on the Chechen side and it had the troops in place to do
so. But, in some of the worst terrain in the world, it is unlikely
that the Russian army can stop guerrilla detachments escaping into
Georgia, already home to 5,000 Chechen refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all the ingredients for a Palestinian-type situation
here in which Chechen guerrillas would base themselves among the
refugees in Georgia and make raids across the border into
Chechnya,'' said an international official Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Cook, the British Foreign Secretary, was at pains
Saturday, during his visit to Georgia, to reassure Shevardnadze
that the outside world is committed to preventing the spread of
instability in the Caucasus and protecting the independence and
integrity of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   He said an expanded force of monitors from the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) would provide ``eyes on
the ground'' along the Georgian-Chechen border.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be enough. Georgia is not a country which can take
much pressure. It is already impoverished by having to feed 300,000
Georgian refugees driven out of the breakaway region of Abkhazia,
whose secession was covertly backed by Russia, in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the Chechen war last year Georgia vehemently
rejected a Russian demand to station border guards on the Georgian
side of the Chechen border.
</P>
<P>
   Russian aircraft later accidentally bombed a Georgian village.
Moscow threatened to make the large Georgian diaspora in Russia
apply for visas.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis in relations was partly defused when Shevardnadze met
Vladimir Putin, the acting Russian president, in January.
</P>
<P>
   Georgian officials said that Shevardnadze was able to convince
Putin that claims by Russian military intelligence that Georgia was
a staging area for Chechen rebels were inflated. Putin spoke of
Georgia as being ``a friendly state.''
</P>
<P>
   The goodwill may not last. Putin spoke Saturday in St.
Petersburg of opening talks with the Chechens, but only when the
rebels have been defeated.
</P>
<P>
   In effect Russia is not prepared to negotiate with any Chechen
leader with any credibility among his own people. This is a recipe
for a long war whose effects will almost certainly spill over into
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   For Shevardnadze it is a delicate balancing game. Because of the
war Russia needs Georgia's cooperation more than ever before. It
may try to gain this through fostering closer links with Tblisi.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time it can put pressure on Georgia through its
influence on secessionist movements and its position as supplier of
most of Georgia's electricity and gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Georgia fears the sound of Russian guns across its
northern border. &QL;

   TBLISI, GEORGIA _ In the snow-covered mountains of northern
Georgia soldiers can hear the roar of battle across the border in
Chechnya creeping gradually towards them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are worried that the Russians will push the Chechen
fighters into Georgia,'' said a Georgian official in Tblisi, the
Georgian capital.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, the fragile republic of five million people on the
southern slopes of the Caucasus Mountains, is trying hard to keep
out of the Chechen war.
</P>
<P>
   It has strenuously denied Russian claims that Chechen guerrillas
regularly cross its 50-mile-long border with Chechnya, bringing in
supplies and reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
   A weary-looking Georgian President Edouard Shevardnadze told The
Independent Saturday ``we are doing everything we can to avoid
getting involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Shevardnadze said that it was Russia's responsibility to police
the border on the Chechen side and it had the troops in place to do
so. But, in some of the worst terrain in the world, it is unlikely
that the Russian army can stop guerrilla detachments escaping into
Georgia, already home to 5,000 Chechen refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all the ingredients for a Palestinian-type situation
here in which Chechen guerrillas would base themselves among the
refugees in Georgia and make raids across the border into
Chechnya,'' said an international official Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Cook, the British Foreign Secretary, was at pains
Saturday, during his visit to Georgia, to reassure Shevardnadze
that the outside world is committed to preventing the spread of
instability in the Caucasus and protecting the independence and
integrity of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   He said an expanded force of monitors from the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) would provide ``eyes on
the ground'' along the Georgian-Chechen border.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be enough. Georgia is not a country which can take
much pressure. It is already impoverished by having to feed 300,000
Georgian refugees driven out of the breakaway region of Abkhazia,
whose secession was covertly backed by Russia, in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the Chechen war last year Georgia vehemently
rejected a Russian demand to station border guards on the Georgian
side of the Chechen border.
</P>
<P>
   Russian aircraft later accidentally bombed a Georgian village.
Moscow threatened to make the large Georgian diaspora in Russia
apply for visas.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis in relations was partly defused when Shevardnadze met
Vladimir Putin, the acting Russian president, in January.
</P>
<P>
   Georgian officials said that Shevardnadze was able to convince
Putin that claims by Russian military intelligence that Georgia was
a staging area for Chechen rebels were inflated. Putin spoke of
Georgia as being ``a friendly state.''
</P>
<P>
   The goodwill may not last. Putin spoke Saturday in St.
Petersburg of opening talks with the Chechens, but only when the
rebels have been defeated.
</P>
<P>
   In effect Russia is not prepared to negotiate with any Chechen
leader with any credibility among his own people. This is a recipe
for a long war whose effects will almost certainly spill over into
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   For Shevardnadze it is a delicate balancing game. Because of the
war Russia needs Georgia's cooperation more than ever before. It
may try to gain this through fostering closer links with Tblisi.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time it can put pressure on Georgia through its
influence on secessionist movements and its position as supplier of
most of Georgia's electricity and gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Georgia fears the sound of Russian guns across its
northern border. &QL;

 McCAIN, BUSH CLASH ON EVE OF WASHINGTON PRIMARY  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY and ED OFFLEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Republican presidential contest erupted into
factional warfare Monday, as Sen. John McCain labeled several
Christian conservative leaders as ``agents of intolerance'' and
Gov. George W. Bush accused his rival of ``needless name calling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald Reagan didn't point fingers. He never played to
religious fears as Senator McCain is doing,'' Bush said after a
speech in Bellevue, Wash., in a mocking reference to McCain's
self-description as a ``proud Reagan Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain flew to Tacoma, Wash., on Monday night for a rally with
more than 2,000 supporters. It was part of a marathon campaign day
that began with a speech in Virginia in which he criticized Bush's
association with the Revs. Pat Roberson and Jerry Falwell. McCain
later flew on to Redding, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens tomorrow will send a signal that we can continue
this incredible crusade,'' McCain said as a trademark campaign bus
took him from the airport to the rally at Pacific Lutheran
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The establishment has taken us on,'' he said. ``The
establishment wants us to lose. The establishment is scared stiff
we are going to break the iron triangle in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``iron triangle,'' a frequent McCain expression, refers to
Congress, the executive branch of government, and Washington, D.C.,
special interests that pay for campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain were campaigning for votes in Tuesday's GOP
primary here. The primary determines only 12 delegates to this
summer's Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, but the
winner will get a major boost going into next week's Super Tuesday
contests in California, New York and 14 other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The delegate count isn't as important as the momentum coming
out of the primary,'' said Rep. Jennifer Dunn, who is chairing the
state Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The white-hot Republican contest, and the Democratic battle
between Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley, has
caused unprecedented interest in Washington's primary.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Secretary of State Ralph Munro, McCain's state
co-chair, predicted Monday night that 50 to 55 percent of the
state's 3.15 million registered voters will cast ballots. Munro
noted that a half-million mail-in ballots have not been returned to
election officials. This could mean the outcome of a close race
will take days to determine.
</P>
<P>
   While debate over the religious right raged nationally, Bush
managers believe they have found a regional issue on which they can
halt McCain's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator has refused to rule out removal of four
Snake River dams as a means to restore the river's decimated salmon
and steelhead runs. Agribusiness interests, irrigators, ports,
shippers and farm organizations in Eastern Washington do not want
to see the dams removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe you breach dams: I believe you can have both
salmon and dams,'' Bush said Monday in an interview. He also
criticized McCain for listing $80 million in Northwest salmon
recovery as one example of pork barrel spending that McCain has
promised to remove from the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, McCain was taking a carving knife to another area
of federal spending important to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on his campaign bus, McCain said that three of
the Pentagon's tactical fighter procurement programs are, when put
together, too expensive. The Boeing Co. is heavily involved in the
three fighter programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least one of them has got to go,'' McCain said. ``We cannot
afford all three programs.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, campaigning earlier Monday in in Virginia Beach, Va.,
accused Falwell and Robertson, founder of the Christian Coalition,
of distorting his pro-life position on abortion and sought to
``smear the reputations of my supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson won Washington's Republican precinct caucuses in 1988,
and his followers have emerged as a major force in GOP presidential
politics.
</P>
<P>
   In some of the harshest words yet spoken in the Republican
campaign, McCain labeled Bush a ``Pat Robertson Republican who will
lose to Al Gore.'' The TV evangelist, whose broadcast empire is
headquartered in Virginia Beach, is a Bush supporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The politics of division and slander are not our values,''
McCain said in Virginia. ``They are corrupting influences on
religion and politics and those who practice them in the name of
religion or in the name of the Republican Party or in the name of
America shame our faith, our party and our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush on Monday described himself as a ``uniter, not a divider''
to more than 300 supporters at Bellevue Community College.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a problem solver, he is a finger pointer,'' Bush said of
McCain. ``... He is a person who obviously wants to divide people
into camps.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bellevue, Bush acknowledged that Robertson, Falwell and other
fundamentalist religious leaders have lined up behind his
presidential bid. ``They're supporters of ours, but I have all
kinds of supporters,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Murphy, a top McCain adviser, shot back in Tacoma on Monday
night: ``He aligned himself with these characters to win in South
Carolina and now he's trying to move away from them.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has sought to derail Bush, and upset the Texas governor
in the New Hampshire and Michigan primaries earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Bush noted Monday that of McCain's 54 Republican colleagues in
the Senate, 35 are backing the Texas governor. ``This is a man,''
he said of McCain, ``who has made a reputation of alleging that
Republican senators are not on the up and up.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, McCain was asked when more GOP officeholders will
come over to his campaign. ``Wait until the tide comes up to their
noses,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   McCain proclaims his conservatism at every stop, but the
reformist themes of his campaign have worked to revive the
long-dormant moderate wing of the Republican Party. In Washington
state, McCain supporters include former three-term Gov. Dan Evans,
ex-Rep. John Miller and Edith Williams, granddaughter of Theodore
Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has courted independents and even Democrats, running ads
urging them to pick Republican ballots in Tuesday's primary so
their votes will be counted toward delegate selection.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, a Democratic state legislator, Rep. Brian Sullivan of
Tacoma, came out for the Arizona Republican, saying that McCain
``stands above party politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is backed by a broad array of Republican regulars, ranging
from moderates like New York Gov. George Pataki to Robertson and
Falwell.
</P>
<P>
   The support was evident Monday. Bush campaigned with GOP Sen.
Slade Gorton. It was Gorton who urged the Texas governor to appear
in the Tri-Cities Monday and champion the Snake River dams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a powerful message over there,'' Gorton said. ``It may
well be the dynamic that determines the primary winner on our side
of the fence.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain predicted Monday night that the Republican nomination
battle will be decided when returns come in from California, New
York and other states next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be over Tuesday (March 7),'' he said.
``I don't know whether this is my own good sense speaking or my
fervent hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush camp remains serenely confident of victory, and that
the race against McCain will leave no lasting wounds going into the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll forget John McCain by the time we get to November,''
Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, looking ahead to the general election, Monday returned
jabs that Gore delivered at his environmental record over the
weekend. Under Bush's leadership, charged Gore, Texas leads the
nation in pollution of its air, water and soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way the vice president does things, through
scorched-earth political tactics,'' Bush said in an interview.
``The fact is that plants that were grandfathered under the Clean
Air Act are being required to meet emission standards. Toxic
emissions in Texas have declined.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush noted that pollution from automobiles remains a major
problem because population is increasing in Texas along with the
number of automobiles on its highways.

VICTORY OVER HORNETS DOESN'T ADD UP
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ When the game finally ended, Sonics coach Paul
Westphal still searched for a few redeeming qualities.
</P>
<P>
   There were none.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics were vastly outrebounded. They ended up with 11 fewer
possessions. And, in the ultimate head-scratcher, the Sonics missed
almost as many free throws in the fourth quarter as their opponent
attempted for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed,'' Westphal admitted after the Sonics somehow
escaped from Charlotte Coliseum Monday with an 84-81 victory
against the Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like the numbers didn't add up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics were outrebounded 51-41 and made just 12 of 26 free
throws, but they had an equalizer in Gary Payton and enough
defensive pressure to continue what they do as well as any team in
the league.
</P>
<P>
   They find ways to win on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a bad home loss to Atlanta last Friday, the Sonics
began this five-game road trip by holding Charlotte to just 36
percent shooting. The defensive stand coupled with Payton's near
triple-double (32 points, nine rebounds and eight assists) helped
the Sonics improve their record to 17-13 away from KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   ``To come in here and be on a long road trip, we needed this
win,'' Payton said. ``We were slapping at the ball and they were
slapping at the ball. And the refs were letting us play. We were
just more active with our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an ugly game in which the team that played the poorest
wasn't necessarily a lock to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this:
</P>
<P>
   -- The Sonics shot 39 percent and were outrebounded 28-17 in the
first half but trailed 47-42 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   -- Charlotte trailed 82-74 with 2:35 left in the game but still
had a chance to tie with 5.9 seconds left because the Sonics missed
nine of 12 free throws in the final frame.
</P>
<P>
   With the Sonics clinging to a three-point lead, the sloppy game
finally ended when Anthony Mason committed Charlotte's 17th
turnover. He threw away the Hornets' chance to tie by heaving a
pass directly at Payton, who allowed the clock to expire while he
held the ball at midcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like two teams playing in the mud,'' Sonics guard Brent
Barry said. ``We played terrible in the first half and were just
down five points. We're a team that you don't know what you're
going to get at home. But we're pretty good on the road. It wasn't
pretty, but it's a road win in a tough building.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics had lost three of their last four games on the road.
Still, they have been most competitive on foreign turf, while most
of their lopsided losses have taken place in KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   How important is it that the Sonics continue to be road
warriors?
</P>
<P>
   Even though they play Eastern Conference foes in Orlando, Miami
and Atlanta this week, those games still have playoff implications
in the West. The victory Monday put the Sonics a half game behind
Phoenix for the fifth seed, which means starting the playoffs on
the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though tonight was kind of in slow motion, we know what
time of year it is,'' Sonics forward Vin Baker said. ``Things
change fast in the standings, so the more we concentrate on taking
care of business the better off we'll be when the real season
begins.''
</P>
<P>
   It appeared the game against the Hornets didn't start for the
Sonics until Payton got hot. He scored 12 of his game-high 32
points in the third quarter when the Sonics took control.
</P>
<P>
   Payton made clutch basket after clutch basket in the second
half. He made five of 11 3-pointers, and his last bomb put the
Sonics ahead by eight points late in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Payton, Barry (13 points on 5-for-11 shooting) and
Rashard Lewis were the only other offensive factors. Lewis' 11
points matched the Hornets' entire bench production.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, I thought we stepped up and played good defense in the
fourth quarter,'' Westphal said. ``Rashard Lewis gave us a boost
off the bench, and Gary made those big 3-pointers like I told him
to. He just wouldn't let us lose.''
</P>
<P>
   It helped that the Hornets played the fourth without Derrick
Coleman, who left in the third with a sprained ankle after
colliding with Payton. Charlotte was intent on feeding Coleman in
the post, and he responded with 14 points and eight rebounds before
the injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics trailed by as many as 10 points in the first half but
were able to use a smaller, quicker lineup to steal the tempo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing Derrick hurt,'' said Charlotte's Eddie Jones, who had
23 points. ``It was an off night. We missed a lot of open shots.
Other than that, I thought we played a pretty good game. But we
can't take anything positive away from this game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics weren't exactly trying to win a beauty pageant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to play great and lose,'' Westphal said, ``and I love
to play bad and win. We'll take it.''

LAKERS' DEFINING MOMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Phil Jackson has a trick hip, so he's not
exactly up for dancing around the issues. Certainly not when it
comes to tonight's game between his Los Angeles Lakers and the
rival Portland Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   He could have offered up the one-game-in-82 cliches, but there
is simply no use downplaying a game that pits the NBA's two hottest
teams against each other for the final time this season. So the
Lakers coach defined it in precise terms that will do nothing to
calm the hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the team that wins this game . . . more than likely
will win the division, at least,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   So there, it's out there: Game 57 on the schedule is officially
the game of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it is just one game,'' Jackson said, ``but it has a lot
of emphasis on it. It's one of those 82 that you say there might be
8 or 10 of in a season that are really big games, and this is
certainly one of those. We do have five games, though, between
(today) and next Monday, so we can't get sidetracked by just one
game being the ultimate goal or quest for us in this season.''
</P>
<P>
   It's close, though, for obvious reasons: The Lakers and Blazers
are tied atop the Pacific Division with 45-11 records, tied for the
top seed in the Western Conference, tied for the best record in the
NBA. Even their winning streaks are even, as they've both won 11
straight.
</P>
<P>
   But this Leap Day game's true impact will be felt in late April.
</P>
<P>
   One of these two teams is likely to claim the No. 1 seed in the
West playoffs, and the homecourt advantage that goes with it. By
NBA rules, the other team will fall to No. 3, behind the Midwest
Division winner, and will probably have to face the
defending-champion San Antonio Spurs in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   So far, neither the Lakers nor the Blazers has been able to
shake the other off their tail, so it's no wonder Jackson considers
this such a defining game. Even more so for the Lakers, who are
down 2-1 in the season series and will lose the head-to-head
tiebreaker if they lose tonight.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, the Lakers are trying to maintain a sense of
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a lot of hype,'' Kobe Bryant said of what's riding on the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really think about it really. I think us as players,
our job is to go out there and play. Phil, coaching staffs, they
like looking at the standings and things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant concedes the Lakers do covet the homecourt advantage,
though, and that race ``makes for good competition. It boosts up
your spirit competitively.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the teams will provide an extreme contrast in
styles. The Lakers are built around three big-time stars _ Bryant,
Shaquille O'Neal and Glen Rice _ who rank among the top-scoring
trios in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Portland boasts a more egalitarian bent _ no Blazer ranks in the
NBA's top 20 in any of the six major statistical categories
(scoring, rebounds, assists, blocked shots, steals, minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they spread the wealth among a host of midrange stars
and one future Hall of Famer (Scottie Pippen). They win with waves
of talent and a second unit _ Jermaine O'Neal, Brian Grant, Detlef
Schrempf, Bonzi Wells and Greg Anthony _ that could spank the
Clippers five nights a week.
</P>
<P>
   Five Blazers average double figures in scoring, led by Steve
Smith and Rasheed Wallace (15.4 points per game each), followed by
Damon Stoudamire (12.9) and Pippen (11.1). All are capable of much
bigger numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do they have a real deep starting five, they have a
real deep bench,'' Shaquille O'Neal said. ``I think their bench
averages 20 to 30 points a game, so you have to stop their starting
five and their bench. You know, it's going to be a tough game, but
if we can do what we've been doing, we'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just that the Blazers pose challenges in the Lakers'
weakest areas. They have a wealth of big bodies _ Arvydas Sabonis,
Wallace, Grant and Jermaine O'Neal _ to throw at Shaq and take
fouls. They have athletic big men (Wallace, Grant) who cause
problems for Lakers forwards Robert Horry and A.C. Green. And they
have a 5-10 speedster in Stoudamire to penetrate and cause havoc on
screen-and-rolls.
</P>
<P>
   On top of everything else, the Lakers have a deficit in the
psychology department. They've lost in their last seven regular-
season trips to the Rose Garden. They admittedly need a win now, if
for nothing else, to prove they can do it in the (inevitable?)
rematch in the conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'm sure they think that we can't beat them at home, so
we have to go up there and try to kind of put a dent in their
confidence a little bit,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   And what does Jackson, the master motivator, tell his team with
so much on the line?
</P>
<P>
   ``I will cry if we lose, that's what I told them,'' he said.
``Naah, I said don't worry about this game. It's an important game.
We just want to measure ourselves up to what we have to become as a
team. And then if we don't win the ballgame, we still have four
left in this week, and you go back and you win those four, so that
you put yourself in a position to win again, the next opportunity
that comes along.''

PEREZ, MALONE NEED A RALLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ By applying a little pressure on certain
fingers of his throwing hand, Los Angeles Dodgers left-hander
Carlos Perez can make his fastball move. If a little pressure can
get a ball to perform magic, maybe it's the most effective way to
handle a ballplayer, too.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Kevin Malone is hoping, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, the Dodgers general manager's reputation
partly rests in the hands of Perez. Malone, remember, is the one
who ripped up the final two years of Perez's contract in 1998 and
signed him to a lucrative three-year deal, only to watch in
helpless horror last year as Perez's career did a pretty fair
imitation of teammate Kevin Brown's sinker.
</P>
<P>
   Malone thought he was freeing Perez to be a force by giving him
no small measure of job security. But the golden paycheck and
guaranteed spot in the Dodgers' 1999 starting rotation had the
opposite effect on the 29-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   He came into camp last spring out of shape and out of focus and
never did find the form that flitted him to National League
prominence in 1998. Perez's numbers in his first full season in
L.A. were achingly bad: a 2-10 record and a 7.43 earned-run
average.
</P>
<P>
   At a loss to explain Perez's dive, Malone decided to put a
little pressure on Perez in the hopes of getting him and his
fastball moving deftly. In December he signed free agent Orel
Hershiser, a one-time Dodgers fan favorite, to compete with Perez
and Eric Gagne for one of the final two spots in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge echoed all the way to Santo Domingo, where Perez
had retreated to straighten out his mechanics and his life.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldog, as Tommy Lasorda long ago nicknamed Hershiser, is
not going to go quietly to the bullpen, where he finished last
season with the New York Mets. It's up to Perez to put him there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlos has to re-establish who he is,'' Malone said one day
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Malone was sitting in his golf cart in the middle of an empty
field at Dodgertown as he spoke, waiting out an afternoon shower.
The tail end of last year's squall perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   Malone's first season in the Dodgers front office was so stormy,
it's a wonder it wasn't tracked by the Weather channel. The clouds
rolled in during May and stayed through September.
</P>
<P>
   Malone's mouth got him in trouble early: His ``there's a new
sheriff in town'' quote has become so familiar it belongs in
Bartlett's. And Perez's arm was Malone's undoing late.
</P>
<P>
   Perez was in Triple-A Albuquerque by the All-Star break. He was
dropping his elbow and pushing his fastball instead of throwing it.
As a result, the pitch was as flat as a pancake and batters were
digging in hungrily.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before the same people who had applauded Malone
for his moxie in locking up Perez's services began lambasting him
for his folly. Perez couldn't win and neither, it seemed, could
Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Like a captain and his ship, Malone and Perez are inextricably
bound. If the pitcher sinks this season, Malone could go down with
him. So if it seemed Malone was reaching for positives when he went
on about the 13 scoreless innings over three games that Perez
pitched during winter ball in his native Dominican Republic, well,
no one ever said all liferafts are sturdy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know Carlos has a ways to go,'' Malone said. ''I'm
encouraged by what I've seen is all. He's committed. It looks like
he has the hunger he lost last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Contracts are handed out all the time in professional sports and
sometimes have the same effect on the athlete as diet pills.
Appetites are sated, production is lost. It's the general manager's
job to try to distinguish between hunger and mere cravings.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't always easy.
</P>
<P>
   The contract that will pay Perez $5 million this year and $7.5
million in 2001 ``was based on the Carlos Perez we had seen in
1998,'' Malone said. ``But as soon as we made that commitment, that
Carlos Perez didn't show up. Maybe he took things for granted,
relaxed a little. He's such a competitor, I would never have
thought that would have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone stopped, stared into space. For a second or two he was
lost in his thoughts. ``How do you control that? That can really
bother you. I've always prided myself on knowing players'
make-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hershiser, Malone knew exactly what he was getting: someone
with command of both the strike zone and the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Until this spring, the only link Hershiser and Perez shared was
a dubious one; in a 12-6 loss at Oakland last June, Perez became
the first Dodgers pitcher since Hershiser in 1994 to allow four
home runs in one game.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, 41, knows he is competing against Perez for a spot in
the starting rotation. It hasn't stopped him from consorting with
Perez. The other day at Dodgertown the two pitchers were part of
the same group sent off to Holman Stadium for fielding work.
</P>
<P>
   Perez made a couple of sparkling plays on infield grounders and
Hershiser patted him and brayed, ``Number 33 in your program,
Number One in your !ital!corazon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already told Carlos up front that whatever he needs, I'm
here for him,'' said Hershiser, who told Octavio Dotel the same
thing last season and proceeded to mentor Dotel right into the
Mets' starting rotation, at his own expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Carlos gets his fastball back,'' Hershiser said. ``I
hope he throws his great change-up for strikes. I hope his breaking
ball flusters hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Trust us, not as much as Malone.

DRED SCOTT: UNDENIABLY LIVING IN THE PRESENT, INEXTRICABLY LINKED
TO THE PAST  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARA ROSE WILLIAMS  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ When you grow up in the Kansas City area with
a name like Dred Scott, it is hard to go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Dred Scott, a fourth-grade teacher at Robinson
Elementary School in Raytown.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, a soft-spoken man, says that all his life he has had to
explain his first name to people who ask: ``Where did you ever get
a name like that?''
</P>
<P>
   Where else?
</P>
<P>
   ``My father, Van Scott, named me,'' Scott said. ``He had always
said he would name his first son Dred. When he was in fourth grade,
in St. Louis, he learned about Dred Scott, the first black slave to
sue his owner for his freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Scott, who later majored in history at Rockhurst College and
is now a lawyer in Atlanta, spent a lot of time studying the Dred
Scott case so that he could explain the name to his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in fourth grade at a Catholic grade school, and I saw a
picture of Dred Scott and a caption about him. In those days that
was all you got on black history in the history books,'' Van Scott
said. ``I wondered then if there was any connection to me and Dred
Scott.''
</P>
<P>
   He found no relationship, but ``it dwelled on my spirit, and I
said, `Someday Dred Scott will revisit this country. I'm going to
name my son Dred.' And I did.''
</P>
<P>
   His son learned the story quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father would say to me, `You have a great name, and one day
you will appreciate it,' &UR; '' Scott recalled. ``From an early age I
knew the story.''
</P>
<P>
   The 19th century Dred Scott was a slave whose Missouri owner
moved to Illinois, a free state. He lived for years as a free man
until his owner moved back to Missouri. His owner again claimed him
as property. The matter went to court.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 11 years, the Supreme Court finally ruled,'' Scott said.
``What they said basically was: Once a slave, always a slave.''
</P>
<P>
   The slave lost the case, but Scott and his father saw him as a
man of great courage, determination and pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 9 years old my parents took me to St. Louis to get
copies of the documents on the Dred Scott case,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said he always knew his name was different. When he was
young, he thought it was awesome to be named after a famous black
man. But as a teen-ager he didn't appreciate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in high school, I started calling myself `Drey'
because I didn't think Dred was cool. I wanted to be cool.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he grew, his real name grew on him.
</P>
<P>
   In college at Southwest Missouri State in Springfield, ``one of
my first classes was a psychology lecture class, and there were
about 200 students in there,'' Scott said. ``The second day the
professor called my name out. I started thinking about that and how
my name made me stand out from everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott said that although his parents never pressured him to live
up to his name, he always felt that he had to grow up to be a
leader and a good example.
</P>
<P>
   As a fourth-grade teacher, Scott says he is able to be just
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a quiet but stern style of teaching,'' Scott said. ``I
try to be gentle and respectful. I never raise my voice. In fact we
don't crack a book in my class until we all learn respect for one
another, confidence and trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott, 26, said he wanted to make a good impression on his
students. Since the students study Missouri history in fourth
grade, Scott uses his name to make sure the children always will
remember who Dred Scott, the slave, was.
</P>
<P>
   They learn that ``it is always OK to be unique,'' he said.
``And, it is always important to stand up for what you truly
believe in.''

SUDDEN RUSH FOR UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA sophomore JaRon Rush's 2-month ordeal ended
Monday in surprising fashion _ with the NCAA appeals committee
cutting his suspension from 29 games to nine and allowing him to
play Saturday at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think he'd be back this year,'' UCLA athletic
director Peter Dalis said. ``I didn't know when we'd get closure.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 1, the NCAA suspended Rush for 15 games for accepting
$200 from sports agent Jerome Stanley and 29 games for accepting
$6,325 from former AAU coach Myron Piggie.
</P>
<P>
   Rush has been out since Dec. 10, so the Stanley penalty ended
earlier this month. The Piggie penalty covered the last 12 games
this season and the first 17 next.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins appealed the Piggie penalty but didn't think Rush
would return this season. They just wanted him back for the start
of next season. But the appeals committee, comprised of five
college administrators from around the country, had other ideas.
Thursday's showdown at Cal is the ninth (and final) game of the
reduced suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it has hit too many of us,'' Bruins forward Rico
Hines said. ``He was practicing with us and somebody said he would
play Saturday. We're like, `He's out 44 games and now he's playing
Saturday?'
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to play it low-key, but I'm sure tonight he'll go
somewhere and say, `Yeah!'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long road.''
</P>
<P>
   Although surprising, the reduction is not unprecedented. Rush's
brother, Kareem, a Missouri freshman who reportedly accepted $1,800
from Piggie, had a 14-game suspension reduced to nine last month.
</P>
<P>
   Before his career ends, Rush must repay the $6,525 to a charity
of UCLA's choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very happy that the NCAA has reduced my suspension and I
am relieved that this situation is finally over,'' Rush said in a
statement released by UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Rush was not available for comment because of his role in an
ongoing federal investigation of Piggie on possible charges of tax
evasion and fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Rush's ordeal began in November, when he testified before a
Kansas City grand jury about his relationship with Piggie. That
testimony prompted the FBI to notify UCLA of possible NCAA rules
violations. Rush was suspended Dec. 10 while UCLA conducted an
internal investigation and submitted its findings to the NCAA. The
focus of the investigation was Rush's relationships with Piggie and
Kansas City businessman Tom Grant.
</P>
<P>
   Grant is a Kansas booster who served as Rush's benefactor
throughout high school. He leased Rush a car and paid for his
education at Pembroke Hill School. He was also the general manager
of Rush's AAU team.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA investigated the Rush-Grant relationship and cleared
both parties of wrongdoing because Rush did not attend Kansas. But
it suspended Rush 29 games for accepting money from Piggie _ some
of which allegedly helped pay for a Chevy Blazer.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal, UCLA argued that Rush did not distinguish Grant's
money from Piggie's money. After all, Piggie worked for Grant as
coach of the AAU team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NCAA felt it could make a separation between what happened
under Tom Grant and Myron Piggie,'' Dalis said. ``We argued that it
was very difficult for JaRon to make that distinction.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Sylvester James, Rush's Kansas City-based attorney:
</P>
<P>
   ``JaRon didn't know where the money was coming from. What was
the difference between a GEO Tracker that Grant bought and a Blazer
that Piggie got?''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA hired Rich Hilliard, a former NCAA director of enforcement
who's based in Kansas City and helps schools present cases before
the NCAA. Hilliard knew the appeals committee's history of reducing
penalties, but he focused on the complicated and unusual nature of
Rush's case. Because of Grant and the AAU links, this was not as
simple as a player taking money from an agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is the (appeals) committee realized the uniqueness of
JaRon's case and came to the conclusion that a reduction was
warranted,'' Hilliard said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are thrilled. Rush won't be available for the most
important game of the season (Cal), but he'll play Saturday in
Maples Pavilion, where UCLA will need all the help it can get.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge lift, because we've had as tough a season as you
can probably have at UCLA,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin. ``We've kind
of been on a roll for a week following the bottoming-out (at
Arizona and Arizona State). Since that point, we've been on an
upswing.''

SEN. ASHCROFT CRITICIZED FOR COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS AT BOB JONES
UNIVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
 -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan said Monday that Sen.
John Ashcroft should return the honorary degree he got from Bob
Jones University and release a text of a commencement speech he
gave at the South Carolina school last May.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan, a Democrat trying to unseat the Republican Ashcroft,
said the senator should not have spoken at a university that bans
interracial dating and whose leaders have used terms such as
``demons'' and ``satanistic cults'' to describe Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was bad judgment on his part,'' Carnahan said
during a visit to Washington for the National Governors'
Association conference. ``Certainly (the university) has divisive
teaching practices.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft showed no inclination Monday to return the degree or to
release a copy of his remarks made to students last May. Chief of
staff David Ayres called Carnahan ``the worst kind of politician:
One who will say or do anything to get elected. Carnahan's campaign
strategy apparently will treat Missourians to a parade of politics
of personal destruction, a series of nasty attacks on John
Ashcroft's character.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayres said Carnahan's real motive is to shore up support among
Catholics in the wake of his veto of a bill banning so-called
partial-birth abortions. Ayres said Ashcroft ``did not attempt to
exploit the anti-Catholic position taken by Carnahan'' on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft did not know about the specific teachings of Bob Jones
University when he spoke in May and still doesn't, spokesman Steve
Hilton said last week. Carnahan said Ashcroft should co-sponsor a
Senate resolution that condemns the school's divisive teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Mel Carnahan knows, John Ashcroft totally repudiates
attacks on Americans' religious faiths and policies that divide
Americans on a racial basis, like those at Bob Jones University,''
Ayres said.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan raised the issue a day after Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush said he regretted not taking the
university's views to task when he spoke there Feb. 2. Bush wrote a
letter of apology to Cardinal John O'Connor, Catholic archbishop of
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly took note of the fact that even George Bush has
finally taken steps to disassociate himself from teachings of the
university,'' said Marc Farinella, campaign manager for Carnahan.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton said the degree Ashcroft got is a ``common courtesy'' to
a guest speaker and that the speech he gave was extemporaneous.
Hilton said he did not have a text.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan said the text of the speech ``would shed light on how
much Senator Ashcroft actually did and did not know about the
university's teachings.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft has not tried to downplay his commencement appearance.
He mentioned it in a family Christmas card recapping highlights of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Republicans said Carnahan was making too much of the
Bob Jones speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me you speak to a lot of people in politics that
don't share your views,'' said John Hancock, executive director of
the Missouri Republican Party. ``This is typical of the way
Democrats run their campaigns. They will race-bait and
Christian-bash at every opportunity.''

KINGS DON'T WANT AVALANCHE EARLY IN PLAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is an important game for the Los Angeles Kings tonight and
it is not the one against Vancouver at the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Avalanche, which a month ago was running away with
the Northwest Division, is slumping and is four points behind
Edmonton heading into their game at Denver's Pepsi Center.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling around the Kings is that with just seven of their
last 20 games on the road, they will make the playoffs. They are
sixth among the eight postseason hopefuls in the Western Conference
and probably would open the first round against the Northwest
champ.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Avalanche dropped three of four to them this
season and the Oilers beat them up last week in Edmonton, the Kings
don't want a first-round matchup against Colorado. The Avs have
most of the stars from their Stanley Cup championship just four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The three division winners in each conference, regardless of
record, are the first three seeds in the playoffs. So even though
Detroit is 12 points ahead of Edmonton overall, the Red Wings are
second to St. Louis in the Central Division and thus a lower seed.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Kings are just two points behind Phoenix (72-70),
they might not want to finish anywhere but sixth if they want to
advance past the first round. If the season ended today, the
Coyotes would face Detroit in the opener.
</P>
<P>
   They certainly don't want to drop to seventh and face defending
Cup champion Dallas, which leads the Pacific Division. Fall to
eighth and the Kings would face St. Louis. A lot has happened since
the Kings beat the Blues at St. Louis in the second game of the
season. The Blues have gone 19-6-4 at home.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, Colorado, which is winless in its last four games,
tied Dallas 1-1. That kept the Avs three points ahead of Calgary
and four points in front of the Ducks, who beat Edmonton 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   The tie did not erase the offensive drought for Colorado, which
managed only one shot on goal in the third period of Friday night's
4-2 loss at St. Louis. Greg De Vries, who was benched against the
Blues, got the Avs' only goal. Five of their last six have been
scored by defensemen.
</P>
<P>
   That should improve with the return of Adam Deadmarsh to the
first line alongside Joe Sakic and Peter Forsberg. Deadmarsh was
back after missing five games with a rib injury.
</P>
<P>
   Sakic has one goal in the past 11 games, and Forsberg has scored
twice in seven games, both last week in New Jersey before the Avs
blew a two-goal lead in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Roy, in net against Dallas, is back after missing three
of four games with a groin injury. But last Tuesday, he gave up two
third-period goals in a 4-2 loss to expansion Atlanta, which had
dropped 12 straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a good loss, that's for sure,'' said Roy, who has
433 NHL victories and needs one to tie Jacques Plante for second
place on the all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado once had an eight-point advantage in the Northwest
Division. After a tough stretch against St. Louis, Dallas and
Edmonton, the Avs face New Jersey on Thursday at home. The Devils
have the best record in the East even though Sunday's 3-0 victory
over Montreal ended a winless streak at five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, you can talk as much as you want in the locker room
that everybody's prepared, everybody's ready,'' said forward Dave
Reid. ``Then we get out there and we don't do it. It's very
frustrating. Everybody says, `Well, we have to learn from this, we
have to learn from this.' But school's over. Hey, let's get
going.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Star power: Dallas strutted more of its Stanley Cup stuff in
last Wednesday's 5-2 romp over Detroit. The Stars trailed 2-1 after
two periods.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, 1-17-1 including playoffs in the late '90s at Joe
Louis Arena, ran their current unbeaten streak in Detroit to 4-0-1,
including four straight victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the playoffs two years ago, we were disappointed we weren't
able to make a better account of ourselves,'' Dallas coach Ken
Hitchcock said, remembering how his team dropped three games in
Detroit during the conference finals. ``We were determined to be a
better team in this building. I think we played up until last year
like we didn't belong. I felt that we didn't think in our minds
that we were good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Who's wondering now? Expect the Red Wings to trade for a
defenseman before the March 14 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last year, when Detroit made drastic moves at the
deadline and got nowhere, there are no blockbusters planned. But
general manager Ken Holland will be looking.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the better defensemen, Tampa Bay's Petr Svoboda and
Montreal's Vladimir Malakhov, will be free agents at the end of the
season. Others, like Nashville's Bob Boughner, New Jersey's Lyle
Odelein and Vancouver's Murray Baron, are considered a little slow
for the Detroit system.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings are just 13-11-2 since Jan. 1 and have allowed 52
goals in those 11 losses. Twice in a recent three-game span, they
allowed four goals apiece in the third period during loss to
Chicago and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things can happen over the last 20 games of the
season,'' captain Steve Yzerman said. ``If we can concentrate on _
whether we win or lose the game _ shutting down teams in a period
where we put our minds to it. That's the one thing we have to do
because that's how it'll be in the playoffs.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
AFTERMATH
</P>
<P>
   It has been a week since !bold!Marty McSorley took his stick to
the head of Vancouver's !bold!Donald Brashear. But the fallout will
be enormous for a long time. There is talk of criminal prosecution.
And there definitely will be civil suits. In criminal law, there is
room for reasonable doubt. In civil law, it's a balance of
probability. Given the violence of hockey, it's tough to make
charges stick, although this might be the exception. It's not as
difficult in a civil suit.
</P>
<P>
   There are two precedents in the NHL involving !bold!Dave Forbes
and !bold!Henry Boucha in 1975 and !bold!Wilf Paiment and
!bold!Dennis Polonich in 1978. In the first case, Forbes butt-ended
Boucha in the face and fractured his cheekbone. Charges were filed,
but the trial ended in a hung jury. Boucha, however, sued Forbes
for $3.5 million and eventually settled out of court. In the second
case, no charges were filed after Paiment high-sticked the Detroit
forward, but Polonich sued successfully for $850,000. &QL; 
WORTH THE WAIT
</P>
<P>
   Calgary's !bold!Valeri Bure isn't scoring as much these days,
but his place has been taken by right winger Jarome Iginla, who
recently scored in 11 consecutive games, including three goals in
two games against the Kings. The streak left him only five games
shy of Gary Suter's team record of 16 games in a row with at least
one point. The Flames are pleased since it is the first time he has
shown the promise that convinced them to trade captain Joe
Nieuwendyk to Dallas for his playing rights in December of 1995. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WE DON'T HAVE THAT PROBLEM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The top ticket at Joe Louis Arena if the Red Wings reach the
Stanley Cup Finals is $400, up from $250 a year ago, for the first
seven rows of the lower bowl. With their payroll close to $50
million and climbing, the Red Wings thought they needed to bump up
prices. Maybe the Kings aren't in that situation, but fans in
Staples Center beware. Talk in Detroit is the club knew those seats
_ owned by corporations _ could easily be afforded.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MO MONEY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A dinner for six with Florida's !bold!Pavel Bure and tennis star
!bold!Anna Kournikova recently was sold for $12,500 at a Panthers
charity auction. The dinner prize originally was supposed to
include Bure only and came close to being sold for $6,500. Then,
when Kournikova hopped onto the stage to show her support for Bure,
the price doubled. The item that sold for the most money was
purchased by a Panthers player, defenseman !bold!Robert Svehla.
Svehla wrote a check for $24,000 (24 is his uniform number) for a
new Harley-Davidson motorcycle, custom designed in Panthers colors.

JAZZ DEFEAT NETS, 106-101 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Two hours after showering him with a thunderous
standing ovation, the fans of the Utah Jazz were booing Keith Van
Horn with all their might. Van Horn was at the foul line midway
through the fourth quarter with the score tied and the possibility
of an upset appearing very real.
</P>
<P>
   The former University of Utah star made one of two free throws
to give the New Jersey Nets a 1-point lead, but the advantage was
fleeting. In their fourth game in five nights, the aging Utah Jazz
proved to be far from fatigued, holding the Nets without a basket
for 7 minutes 13 seconds to take command and leave the Delta Center
with a 106-101 victory.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Nets' ninth straight loss to Utah, a team they have
not defeated since Jan. 17, 1994. In a near triple-double
performance, Karl Malone led the Jazz with 35 points, 12 rebounds
and 9 assists. Converting most of Malone's assists was Jeff
Hornacek. The veteran off guard Hornacek made 10 of 11 field-goal
attempts, including five 3-pointers, to score 27 points.
</P>
<P>
   Stephon Marbury led the Nets with yet another fabulous
performance, recording 34 points and 11 assists. After the Nets
went 13 straight possessions without making a basket to fall behind
by 9 points, Marbury hit a driving layup and an ensuing free throw
to pull them within 98-92 with 1:37 to play. He scored two more
baskets, including a 3-pointer with 16.8 seconds left that cut
Utah's lead to 103-101. But Hornacek promptly answered with two
free throws, and Scott Burrell missed a 3-point attempt for the
Nets to end the suspense.
</P>
<P>
   In his first professional game in Utah, Van Horn was received
with great appreciation before the game. He put on an adequate
performance, finishing with 18 points and 13 rebounds before
fouling out in the final minute. Kerry Kittles followed Marbury
with 22 points for the Nets, who fell to 5-22 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn's intentions were clear early. Just 10 seconds into the
game, he took the ball strong to the basket against Malone, getting
2 points on a goaltending call on Olden Polynice. Moments later,
Van Horn put back an offensive rebound, then scored 2 free throws
to account for 6 of the Nets' first 8 points.
</P>
<P>
   The adrenaline that was driving Van Horn, who had six rebounds
in the first six minutes, was no more evident than on a block of a
Malone shot three minutes into the contest. After falling when
Malone received an entry pass in the paint, Van Horn jumped to his
feet to swat Malone's layup attempt. He was called for goaltending,
but his vigor was nonetheless impressive.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Nets seemed energized as well, and the result
was one of their best offensive quarters of the season as they
grabbed a 35-28 lead. Marbury scorched the future Hall of Famer
John Stockton for 11 points and 6 assists in the first quarter.
Kittles scored 9 in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Jim McIlvaine provided strong protection around the basket,
swatting four shots in the opening 12 minutes. But otherwise, the
Nets' effectiveness on offense was not matched on the defensive
end. Utah, with its intricate screening and cutting, picked the
Nets' defense apart for several backdoor layups, and took advantage
of the Nets' laxity around the 3-point line. Hornacek began what
would be an outstanding half by scoring 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   Casey may have unwittingly cooled off Van Horn by sitting him
down for the last two minutes of the first quarter, because his
second period was unproductive. After re-entering at the
eight-minute mark, Van Horn missed all four of his shots and
committed two turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Nets, Marbury and Kittles stayed hot.
Marbury went into the half with 15 points, 7 assists and 4
rebounds. Kittles had 13 points.

   BAHAMAS-DEVELOP (New Providence, Bahamas) _ The tourists who
scuba dive among the reefs and tan themselves on the sandy shores
have probably seen more of this island's coastline than Therell
Bethell ever has. She cannot remember the last time she visited a
decent stretch of beach, since the development boom over the last
decade brought gated communities and exclusive resorts. ``Bahamians
do not have access to the beach,'' said Bethel, a legal secretary
in Nassau. ``Bahamians have to have a puddle in our backyards to
swim.'' The long-simmering resentment over the loss of their
beaches has crystallized in opposition to a proposed luxury
community on the longest remaining stretch of undeveloped coastline
in New Providence, the most populated island in the Bahamas. By

challenge to medical authority and new techniques to pinpoint

Perhaps, instead of moving a valuable trait like resistance to cold
from a fish to a plant, genetic engineers could achieve the same
result by goading the plant into a mutation that activates genes
for cold tolerance already present in its DNA. By Barnaby J. Feder

QUICK STARTS HELPS TEXAS TOP KANSAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Texas-Kansas matchup may not have had the
import once thought months ago, but it was nevertheless a Big
Monday for the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   Texas jumped on the Jayhawks with a terrific defensive effort in
the first half, kept KU at arm's distance in the second half, and
won a 68-54 victory that clinched a first-round bye in next week's
Big 12 tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 16 Longhorns (21-7) pushed their conference record to
12-3 and assured themselves of at least a fourth-place finish,
while dropping No. 23 Kansas (21-8) to 10-5. KU now faces the
possibility of playing on the first day in Kansas City for the
first time in the league's four-year history.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the Longhorns' first victory over Kansas in Big 12
play. Texas is 1-3 against KU in Big 12 play and 2-7 overall.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Ivan Wagner led the Longhorns with a career-high 19
points, including 8 of 10 free throws in the last 3:31. Senior
forward Gabe Muoneke, who started his last home game, responded
with 16 points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the emotion and hype surrounding this game, we never
lost sight of the big picture,'' Wagner said. ``We knew we were
playing for seeding in the Big 12 tournament, and in the NCAA, and
we executed our game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas held Kansas to a season-low 21 points in first half,
contesting every shot and limiting the Jayhawks to 6-of-29
shooting. Kansas made only two of its first 15 shots as the
Longhorns raced to a 24-6 lead. In the half, Texas converted 12 KU
turnovers into 14 points and scored five times off the break.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas shot 31.1 percent, making UT 16-0 when holding teams to
less than 40 percent this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to put that first half (defensively) in a bottle,''
UT coach Rick Barnes said. ``We've learned from every loss. The
biggest thing we've realized since the Iowa State loss is that
every role on this team is important. The last two games we've
really played our roles well.
</P>
<P>
   ``They slowed us down a little bit and we got a little tentative
against their zone in the second half. But our guys stayed sharp
and we never let it get under 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by freshman point guard Kirk Hinrich, Kansas inhaled a
little of Texas' intensity after the half. After trailing by as
much as 20 points in the first half, KU pulled to within 10 points
three times. But each time, Texas responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dug ourselves a hole in the first half and coach gave us a
motivational speech to come out and play in the second half,'' KU
forward Drew Gooden said. ``We gave it our best, but it wasn't
enough. We dug ourselves so deep, we just got our hands out of the
hole and couldn't pull ourselves up.''
</P>
<P>
   Center Chris Mihm wrestled with foul problems and scored only
nine points. But the 7-foot junior pulled down a game-high 12
rebounds and heard chants of ``one more year'' and ``come back
Chris'' from the Erwin Center crowd of 13,561.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it was extremely tough for me to get the ball
inside,'' Mihm said. ``But everyone just played a fantastic game
tonight. They chose to try and take me out of the game, but we have
a fantastic team and they will take it right to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Mihm reiterated that he has not made his mind up about going to
the NBA a year early.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to know the town and the students support and care
about you,'' he said. ``No matter what happens, it was special for
all of us. I can't start to talk about (the NBA) now, but that was
special.'' nn

 EX-COP ACCUSED IN 10 BANK ROBBERIES  &HT;     By MANNY FERNANDEZ 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jerry Del Olson locked up scores of criminals during his lengthy
career as a police officer in the Sierra Nevada town of
Placerville.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Olson is the one behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   The former cop is the same man, FBI agents say, who is
responsible for a two-month string of Northern California bank
robberies.
</P>
<P>
   The 39-year-old Olson, who now lives in Concord, was arrested in
Reno on Saturday, police said, when they caught him fleeing after a
Wells Fargo Bank holdup. Authorities say the arrest ends Olson's
string of successful bank robberies stretching from Walnut Creek to
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Olson was arrested on suspicion of robbing only the Reno bank,
but FBI agents say they have enough evidence to link him to nine
other bank robberies since January. That evidence includes
statements made by Olson and as well as from witnesses to the
previous heists, FBI spokesman Nick Rossi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clothing he has worn at the robberies has been very
consistent, so surveillance photographs and videotapes have helped
us connect a number of these to the same person,'' said Rossi, a
special agent in the FBI's Sacramento office.
</P>
<P>
   Rossi would not say how much money was stolen in the holdups.
</P>
<P>
   The rash of robberies sparked an investigation involving the FBI
and law enforcement officials in Sacramento, Auburn, Stockton,
Walnut Creek and Pleasant Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The first holdup attributed to Olson occurred January 14 at a
U.S. Bank in Auburn. Credit unions and banks in Walnut Creek,
Stockton and Sacramento soon followed. Earlier this month, there
was the February 5 robbery at a Wells Fargo Bank in Pleasant Hill
and a February 12 U.S. Bank hold-up in Sacramento. Another heist
occurred again in Stockton, as well as others in Fresno and Santa
Rosa.
</P>
<P>
   But authorities said Olson's luck appeared to run out Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 9:30 a.m., Reno police responded to a robbery at
the Wells Fargo Bank on Neil Road in the southeast area of the
city. Officers had a description of the suspect and spotted Olson
leaving the area in a vehicle, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Olson was pulled over and detained. A witness later identified
Olson as the robber, and an undisclosed amount of money was
recovered inside his vehicle, Reno police said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents took custody of Olson, who is being held in the
Washoe County Jail in Nevada. He is scheduled to make his first
federal court appearance Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured during the robberies, but investigators
believe Olson pointed a handgun at a security guard while fleeing a
bank in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Arresting a former law enforcement officer for such serious
offenses is disturbing, though rare, Rossi added.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those facts of life that we just have to deal
with,'' he said. ``Occasionally, even those who have had law
enforcement training act in ways that are inconsistent with their
prior obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson was an officer in Placerville for nearly two decades,
authorities said, though the circumstances involving his departure
from the Police Department were unclear Monday. Placerville police
officials could not be reached for comment last night.

LEGACY RUNNERS ENJOY ANNUAL FEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; L &LR; OS ANGELES _ Running in a marathon race takes some
incentive. Cliff Housego has all the incentive he needs to run in
the L.A. Marathon every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father died of a heart attack at 48, and my father-in-law
died of a heart attack at 51,'' said the 51-year-old who works as a
dance instructor in Thousand Oaks northwest of Los Angeles. ``It's
very important for me to stay healthy, because I want to be able to
watch my kids' kids grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the approximately 21,000 runners who will set out Sunday
morning to conquer the grueling 26.2-mile course, Housego will be
one of 366 ``legacy runners'' to have started and finished all of
the 14 previous Los Angeles Marathons.
</P>
<P>
   Housego celebrates the completion of each marathon by drinking a
margarita and going out for a night of dancing, a task that has
become more daunting each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I was one hurtin' puppy,'' Housego said. ``I
couldn't even locate my car keys, that's how out of it I was, but I
jumped in the Jacuzzi for a few minutes and after that I kept going
all night.''
</P>
<P>
   Valencia resident Michael Bare believes Housego's streak is
something special.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty amazing when you stop and think about it,'' Bare
said. ``There are so many little things that could go wrong, with
injuries or whatever, things that could ruin a lot of streaks, but
there are still a lot of people running.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``legacy runners'' include 66 area residents, and many of
them share a similar pattern. They ran the first marathon, in 1986,
as a means to stay in shape and achieve a goal.
</P>
<P>
   They enjoyed themselves, came back, and before they knew it,
five years had passed.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years, well, why stop now?
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day, my dad reminded me of the first marathon,''
said Barry Leonard, 44, an optometrist who lives in Tarzana. ``My
dad was there videotaping the finish, and on the tape you can hear
him say, `Boy, that sure was exciting, when's the next one?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of smiled and said, You know, that was a great
experience, but I don't see any reason to put myself through that
ever again. Of course I went back, and now I want to do all of
them,'' Leonard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran the first one when I was 30, and I want to be 65 and say
I ran one every year for 35 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the ``legacy runners'' were recognized in a special
ceremony at Olvera Street, where they each received an award from
Mayor Richard Riordan. They will have a special place in the mass
of humanity Sunday morning, as they will line up right behind the
elite runners near the front of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always look forward to this time of the year,'' said Mickey
De Palo, 53, a recreation program coordinator from Burbank. ``I
know I'm another year older, but when I get on the starting line I
feel as young as ever.''
</P>
<P>
   De Palo will celebrate his 15th anniversary by staying with his
family at the Regal Biltmore Hotel, right in the middle of the
annual marathon festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a parent, I try to be the best role model I can be,'' De
Palo said. ``I have a 9-year-old son, and I hope this shows him
something about dedication, and being able to accomplish anything
you set your mind to, as long as you give it your best effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's a way to make sure I stay in shape and watch my
diet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many participants share De Palo's view that running the Los
Angeles Marathon makes them feel young and helps them maintain a
measure of physical self-discipline in their busy lives.
</P>
<P>
   Health is also of paramount importance to Jose Cadenas of
suburban Encino, who previously smoked 2 packs of cigarettes per
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the first one just to support a friend who was
running, but I got caught up in the excitement and decided to run
myself,'' Cadenas said. ``My mother-in-law died of lung cancer, so
I realized that it was time to get healthy and do it for my
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the streaks have come close to ending throughout the
years. Bare was diagnosed with a bilateral hernia after the first
marathon, and competed for several years with a neck injury that
caused his arm to go numb when he ran. Two other local runners have
rebounded from serious bicycle injuries to resume running, and at
least one competitor almost expects a pitfall each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a running family joke,'' said Dave Vint of
Newbury Park in neighborning Ventura County, who has come down with
flu symptoms prior to six of his 14 marathons. ``I'm normally a
pretty healthy person, but it's almost climactic every year,
because people just wait for me to get sick.''

 PARTY REGISTRATIONS SEE LITTLE CHANGE BEFORE PRIMARY  &HT;     By JOHN WILDERMUTH 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite well-publicized efforts by political campaigns to
convince voters to switch parties, California's party registration
figures will be virtually unchanged going into the state's March 7
primary election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had more registration changes than normal, but nothing
overwhelming,'' said Hugh Denton, registrar of voters for Contra
Costa County. ``We didn't see either party gain a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain, whose insurgent try for the Republican
presidential nomination depends on attracting independent and
Democratic voters to his banner, convinced a reported 30,000 voters
to re-register Republican. But in a state with 14.6 million
registered voters, that's barely a blip on the political radar
screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``California is a really big state,'' said Bob Mulholland, an
adviser to the state Democratic party. ``Except for the month
before the presidential election, any registration activity by any
group is just a mosquito bite.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of Democrats registered in the state dropped by
91,516, or 1.35 percent, between January 1 and February 7, the
close of registration for next week's election. Republican
registration grew by 21,578, or 0.42 percent, while 77,145 more
voters declined to state a party affiliation, an increase of 3.83
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Independent voters will find themselves on the outside looking
in when it comes to next week's presidential primary vote. Under
California's blanket primary initiative, passed in 1996, voters can
choose any candidate, regardless of party.
</P>
<P>
   But both the Democratic and Republican parties have ruled that
only votes by their registered members will count toward selecting
the presidential candidate this year.
</P>
<P>
   A number of local counties did see independents changing their
registration so their votes would count in the party primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the blanket primary law, we always saw independents
re-registering before the primary and then changing back right
after election day,'' said Theresa Rabe, a spokeswoman for the
election department in San Francisco. ``We're seeing that again.''
</P>
<P>
   In a number of cases, it was the Republican party, where
McCain's attempt to catch Texas Gov. George W. Bush has drawn
plenty of attention, that got the local registration boost.
</P>
<P>
   San Mateo County, for example, is 51 percent Democrat, 29
percent Republican and 17 percent independent. But between January
1 and February 7, 673 Democrats re-registered as Republicans,
compared to 334 Republicans who became Democrats. At the same time,
315 independents signed on as Democrats, while 364 became
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 6,000 people register, with about half of those
re-registrations,'' said Mary Lavelle, an elections specialist with
the county. ``That's a lot for a county our size.''
</P>
<P>
   The registration changes did cause a few problems for Bay Area
counties. Because some absentee ballots were sent out before the
registration deadline arrived, a number of voters who changed
parties late ended up with the wrong ballot, said Xixi Castillo, a
registration supervisor with Alameda County.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to send inquiries out to those people and then have
them return their ballots so we could issue them the right one,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing effort to purge nonexistent voters from county
registration rolls also played a part in the tiny statewide
increases. In Los Angeles County alone, Democratic registration
dropped by 145,893 and Republican registration by 55,570 as the
county tried to clean up its list of eligible voters. On a smaller
scale, Stanislaus County has dropped more than 6 percent of its
voters from the rolls this year.
</P>
<P>
   But even the small boost was good news for California
Republicans, who still trail the  &LR; Democrats in statewide
registration, 46 percent to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited,'' said Stuart DeVeaux, a spokesman for the
state Republican party. ``This sends a key message to the
Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest trend in the state continued to be the move toward
independent voters, whose numbers have been steadily increasing in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Since March 1996, the number of independent voters has grown by
563,658 while Democratic and Republican numbers have fallen.

TCU RIDES FAST FINISH TO SWEEP OF SMU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ARTHUR GARCIA 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Think Monday night's TCU-SMU showdown at Moody Coliseum
wasn't intense? Just check under Billy Tubbs' right eye this
morning.
</P>
<P>
   TCU's veteran coach will no doubt wake up with a welt on his
upper cheek, compliments of a penny hurled out of the stands
seconds after the Horned Frogs completed a season sweep of SMU with
a 86-83 comeback victory.
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs laughed off the coins thrown at him after the game _ ``My
lawyer told me not to comment'' _ and instead praised his team's
resilience in the second half. The Frogs rallied from seven points
down with five minutes left, after making up a 13-point deficit
earlier in the half, and held their breath on two SMU 3-point tries
in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an outstanding game and a hard-fought game,'' said
Tubbs, now 11-2 against the Mustangs. ``We felt that defensively we
had to be the aggressors, and it paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs (16-13, 7-6 Western Athletic Conference) broke a
two-game losing streak and might have rekindled their NIT chances.
TCU outrebounded the Mustangs in the second half and nailed 7 of 10
3-point shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to come out strong and rebound,'' said Marquise
Gainous, who scored 17 of his 27 points and grabbed 12 of his 14
rebounds in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``At lot of times we knew where the ball was coming (off missed
shots) and as long as we got a hand on it, we could put it back
in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs' last three baskets, including Gainous' shot that gave
TCU an 80-79 lead with 2:19 left, followed offensive rebounds.
Bingo Merriex made the last two, including a tip-in with 29 seconds
left for a 84-81 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Tubbs told us at the (halftime) break we needed to go
hard to the boards, and that got us back in the game,'' said
Merriex, who scored 15 points and made 3 of 5 3-point tries.
</P>
<P>
   The Mustangs had a chance to send the game into overtime after
TCU's Thomas McTyer made the first of two free throws with 11.6
seconds left. SMU quickly advanced the ball up the right side of
the court, but Stephen Woods misfired on a 3-point try. The ball
bounced out past the 3-point line on the left side, and Renaldo
Bratton missed an off-balance shot as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had two good looks with two good shooters,'' said Woods,
who scored 18. ``We just didn't knock them down.''
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind 52-39 four minutes into the second half,
the Frogs went on a run similar to their 32-10 spurt that closed
out a 92-75 victory against SMU in Fort Worth on Jan. 29. This time
it was a 26-9 run, capped by a 3-pointer from Ryan Carroll that
gave TCU a 65-61 lead midway through the half.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll scored 20 points on 9-of-17 shooting in 35 minutes and
admitted a little trash talking by SMU's Jeryl Sasser before the
game helped light a fire. Sasser, the Mustangs' leading scorer,
made only 2 of 13 shots and scored six points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rivalry,'' Carroll said simply. ``And it really got us
hyped up when Sasser said there's was no way we could come in here
and beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mustangs (21-6, 9-4) were counting on a victory to keep
their WAC title hopes alive and solidify their NCAA Tournament
hopes. Now, even if SMU beats league-leading Tulsa (11-2) Saturday,
the Mustangs will probably finish third.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs also got a unexpected lift from Myron Anthony, who
scored 13 points and pulled down five rebounds in 29 minutes off
the bench. Anthony scored in double figures for the first time
since Jan. 13 against San Jose State, and his eight first-half
points earned him a second-half start.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best I've felt in a long time,'' he said. ``I had
a good week of practice. My shot felt good, and my legs felt good.
I'm back.''
</P>
<P>
   With so much at stake coming into the game, both teams spent the
opening minutes working out the jitters. The teams committed eight
turnovers in the first five minutes, and the Frogs missed nine of
their first 10 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Davis helped the Mustangs build a 17-9 lead with an
inside-outside scoring display.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs pulled within one (19-18) on Gainous' 3-pointer at the
8:55 mark, but SMU kept the lead for the remainder of the half,
mainly because of its dominance on the glass. The Mustangs held a
rebounding edge in the half, and grabbed 10 offensive rebounds. nn

 MCCAIN QUESTIONED OVER DEBATE DECISION  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDDING, Calif. _ GOP presidential hopeful John McCain brought
his ``Straight Talk Express'' to the Golden State Monday night for
a three-day campaign swing to convince Californians that he hasn't
given up on their state after canceling a debate with Texas Gov.
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   While hundreds of loyal Republicans turned out to see him at an
airport rally on a misty night in Redding, some voters said they
wanted straight talk on why the Arizona senator will skip the only
scheduled GOP debate before the March 7 primary in crucial
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure seems like a bad time ... just when they're getting
down to the wire,'' said Rick Stephens, an engineer from Redding
who waited more than an hour to see McCain last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he has so much knowledge of policy, then this is the time
to show it,'' said Stephens' wife, Pam, a registered Republican who
said she is still undecided and wants to be convinced that McCain
deserves her vote. ``But he found a nice little opportunity to
cancel. It's that rubber-hits-the-road thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments illustrate how McCain, who has campaigned on a
message of ``straight talk,'' appears to have undercut his own
sales pitch by backing out of the debate with his GOP rivals,
political insiders and voters are saying this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is politics as usual _ and it undermines McCain's whole
argument that he is different and he does not play those games,''
said California political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe. Worse, ``it
lends the perception that he's afraid of (Texas Gov. George W.)
Bush, afraid of risking momentum. Isn't he the insurgent?''
</P>
<P>
   McCain campaign officials _ after criticizing Bush earlier for
hesitating to participate in the debate _ confirmed Monday that
McCain had backed out of Thursday's Republican presidential debate
sponsored by CNN and the Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   They said McCain would debate Bush instead on NBC's ``Meet the
Press'' on Sunday, but Bush's campaign said there are no such
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Word of McCain's decision, which was apparently made last week,
came as the senator was scheduled to arrive in California last
night in Redding for an airport rally. He is scheduled to take his
``Straight Talk Express'' bus through the Central Valley Tuesday
and then to Southern California before heading to New York, his
campaign said.
</P>
<P>
   But now, as he tries to woo California voters, he will have to
explain his apparent decision to de-emphasize California and
concentrate his time and resources on New York, where polls show
him holding a narrow lead over Bush.
</P>
<P>
   With just a week to go before the crucial March 7 primaries,
when 16 states, including California and New York, will select
delegates, McCain's decision to skip the California debate _ the
only nationally televised debate between now and ``Super Tuesday''
_ has flabbergasted some state political analysts.
</P>
<P>
   They say that in the nation's most populous state, where recent
polls have shown McCain gaining in the popular vote, the move is
clearly ``a major mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the life of me, I can't understand what they're doing,''
said Republican consultant Sal Russo. ``When you're behind, like
McCain, you need all the exposure you can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Bebitch Jeffe was even more critical, saying McCain has lost an
opportunity to deliver his message ``in a national debate, not just
a state debate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision not to debate in California could be the
equivalent of the Bob Jones (University) decision on the Bush
side,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; McCain Campaign Explains
</P>
<P>
   Top McCain campaign officials insisted the senator is still
committed to winning this state's primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain is putting in more time on the ground in
California than Bush, and more time on the air,'' said Dan Schnur,
McCain's communications director. ``Our goal ... is to convince
grassroots Republicans that following the party establishment onto
the Bush train is the wrong decision.''
</P>
<P>
   A Field Poll released Monday showed California's Republicans
backing Bush over McCain in the March 7 primary by 48 percent to 28
percent in the contest for the state's 162 convention delegates, a
ratio virtually unchanged from a Field Poll earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   But in the state's open primary, where voters can choose from
among all the presidential candidates regardless of party, McCain
has seen his support among all likely voters surge from 10 percent
in January and 15 percent earlier this month to 20 percent today,
just 2 percentage points behind Bush and 8 points behind Democratic
front-runner Al Gore's 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That makes it increasingly conceivable that McCain could beat
Bush among all California voters, yet badly lose the
Republican-only count that will determine who receives all of the
state's national Republican convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic pollster Paul Maslin, who is watching the McCain rise
with interest, said McCain's camp also is watching those numbers _
and what appears to be his stronger chances elsewhere. That is one
reason why, he said, the senator may have had to make tough
decisions about where to spend his most valuable commodity leading
up to Super Tuesday _ his time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short run, it hurts him,'' said Maslin. ``'But if he
wins Virginia (Tuesday) after attacking Pat Robertson and Jerry
Falwell in their home state _ then you've got a monster on your
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, McCain will take his campaign through Stockton, Fresno
and Bakersfield. Tomorrow, he will travel to San Bernardino and
Riverside counties before heading to Los Angeles on Thursday
morning.

TEAM SCORING LEADER SET FOR CANUCKS

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Kings leading scorer Ziggy Palffy will
be in the lineup tonight against the Vancouver Canucks at the
Staples Center after missing Saturday's game in San Jose with back
spasms and an injured neck.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy awoke Saturday morning with the same lower-back pain that
first surfaced in December. He also got up angry, knowing he had
been cross-checked across the neck last Friday by Vancouver's Matt
Cooke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something has to change, the referee can't keep ignoring these
plays,'' Palffy said.
</P>
<P>
   But with 20 games left in the regular season and the playoffs
approaching, on-ice officials are less likely to call penalties.
Several times on the last trip, the Kings were wise not to
retaliate during close games. But they will see more muscle from
opposing teams in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ziggy has taken some bumps to the body, but I thought the
reason he didn't play against San Jose was because his lower back
tightened up overnight,'' coach Andy Murray said. ``That is part of
the game this time of year.''
</P>
<P>
   It also is a reason the Kings are looking into acquiring a
rugged forward with playoff experience before the March 14 trade
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Murray missed Palffy's playmaking, which
accounted for seven goals and 12 assists in his previous 12 games.
Murray was upset that there was no one to take over in Palffy's
absence. The Kings blew a 2-1 lead in the second period and lost
6-3 to the Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed him, but I was not happy with our team,'' Murray
said after Monday's practice. ``I got after them today. I respect
what they went through on the (seven-game) road trip, but we lost
some individual battles. We need everybody on board and Saturday
night we didn't have that.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Spoiler's role: The Canucks are coming off Sunday's 2-1
victory over Phoenix, the team that leads the Kings by two points
in the Pacific Division. Vancouver is 6-3-1 since the All-Star
break, collecting 13 of 20 points, a .667 pace the Canucks likely
need the rest of the way to have a shot at the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they're pretty desperate, trying to get into the
playoffs,'' said ex-Canuck Jyrki Lumme, now with Phoenix. ``We
should be desperate, too. We just didn't have the legs. We didn't
have any jump. We couldn't get anything going.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Quick whistles: Stephane Fiset, who defeated Vancouver 5-2 on
Friday night, will be in net tonight against the Canucks. . . .
Sharks general manager Dean Lombardi said he is casting his Norris
Trophy vote as the league's best defenseman to St. Louis' Chris
Pronger over the Kings' Rob Blake. ``Not to take anything away from
Blake, but I think this guy is pretty special,'' Lombardi said of
Pronger. ``He's the equivalent of a Dominik Hasek for defensemen
right now. He can completely control a game in all phases.'' . . .
Kings defenseman Garry Galley, who aggravated a season-long neck
injury last Friday, will play.

IT TAKES A CHILD TO SHOW THE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The homeless guy was jaywalking across Market
St. at Fifth when a slow-moving car hit him and knocked him to the
pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Fleming, who is 13 and lives in Union City, was waiting
for a bus, on her way to visit her father and stepmother. Katie saw
the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   The driver didn't stop; the car kept moving slowly in the heavy
afternoon rush-hour traffic, and two people walked alongside the
car, knocking on the driver's window _ ``Hey! Stay here, you hit
someone!''
</P>
<P>
   The driver didn't stop, and as soon as the traffic cleared, the
car sped away.
</P>
<P>
   Katie and a frail elderly woman went to the aid of the
hit-and-run victim lying in the busy street. The man said he wanted
to get up and struggled to his feet. Katie and the woman were
overmatched by the traffic and asked passers-by for assistance.
</P>
<P>
   By crazy coincidence, each of the many well-dressed folks
hurrying home from work or to the next tourist spot was in too much
of a hurry to lend a hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to get guys to help us,'' Katie says. ``No one
responded.''
</P>
<P>
   Katie and the woman finally helped the man off the road. The
cops came. Did anyone get a license number? Yes, Katie noted and
memorized it. And she was the only eyewitness who stuck around to
talk to the cops.
</P>
<P>
   The man declined medical attention and wobbled away.
</P>
<P>
   There is no record of a police report, and since there is no
victim to testify, it's unlikely anything would happen anyway. So
the hit-and-run driver gets a free pass, and a pedestrian-shaped
sticker for his or her car door.
</P>
<P>
   Katie is an eighth-grader at Barnard White Middle School in
Union City. She worked last summer in an S.F.
homeless-environmental-elderly volunteer program.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Mr. Mayor, how about a key to the city for Citizen Kate?
</P>
<P>
   TOO BAD about John McCain deciding not to honor his promise to
debate George W. Bush in California this week.
</P>
<P>
   Looks like the Straight Talk Express came to a fork in the
tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``STOMP,'' the show the theater critics love and the theater
cockroaches hate, is coming to San Francisco. Hundreds of wannabe
stompers lined up outside the Alcazar Theater on Geary Monday
morning to suck in fumes from an asphalt cooker and wait their turn
to audition.
</P>
<P>
   The show's percussion instruments are all items you find on the
street. In Stomp's five-year run in New York, cast members went
through 5,200 brooms.
</P>
<P>
   Wonder where they're going to find brooms in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   WILL THE Giants' new ballpark be breezy? The answer, my friends,
is blowin' in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hundley noticed that the newly planted sycamore trees in
front of the park on King Street ``are already leaning quite
noticeably in the direction of the wind. Is Pac Bell Park destined
to be nothing more than Candlestick North?''
</P>
<P>
   BIG OIL busts two-buck barrier by the bay!
</P>
<P>
   The Shell station at the corner of 8th and Harrison, reports
Scott McKellar, was selling premium Monday for $2.05 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Used to be you'd tell the attendant, ``Fill 'er up.'' Now you
hand the man your wallet and say, ``Empty 'er out.''
</P>
<P>
   EYE-OPENER: Chuck Barragan was strolling past the Javalencia
coffeehouse on Valencia one recent morning and noticed a very large
pig's head lying in the doorway.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think?'' asks Chuck. ``Someone didn't get their
kosher muffin? An offering to the gods of misfortune?''
</P>
<P>
   The shop owner tells me he has no idea, but he quickly disposed
of the head. Th-th-that's all, folks!
</P>
<P>
   THE SCOOP on the poop: In Yuba County, a developer and his
partner are in trouble with the law for applying treated sewage
sludge to their farmland.
</P>
<P>
   The news story in the Marysville Appeal-Democrat (sent by Doris
Buell) says the men who are using these ``biosolids'' on their
cropland are named Fran Arciero and (drumroll, please) ... Slick
Gardner.
</P>
<P>
   THEY'VE INVENTED a new game in San Pablo, where the cops and the
homeless don't always see eye to eye.
</P>
<P>
   One homeless man often visits with his 5-year-old son in a city
park. One day, a police officer caught the youngster bowling with
plastic soda bottles and a playground ball, and told the boy that
his game might very well be illegal.
</P>
<P>
   So now dad plans to apply for a city permit to use the park for
games of ``San Pablo Bocce Ball.''
</P>
<P>
   BIG SHOOTOUT at the Washington Square Bar &AMP; Grill Monday! Cops
and bad guys blasted away, shattered the Washbag's windows, bad
guys got shot up good and were carted off in a meat wagon.
</P>
<P>
   And, Cut! A happy ending, as Nash Bridges wrapped up another
messy case, Bubba.
</P>
<P>
   ``REMOTE RAGE'' was setting in.
</P>
<P>
   Jenefer Bickers had lost her TV clicker. Looked everywhere,
including previous hiding places like the refrigerator and the
garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Is there anything more annoying?
</P>
<P>
   Desperate, frantic, Bickers finally phoned a psychic friend, who
told her to look again behind a sofa cushion. And there it was.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks for that tip, Jenefer, but if that psychic was really
your friend, she would have phoned you first.

<P>
   BERLIN _ The Austrian far-right leader Joerg Haider stunned
political friends and foes alike by announcing Monday that he
wanted to step down as leader of the Freedom Party. But there is no
danger of Haider, the most successful politician in postwar Austria
and an ambitious chancellor wannabe, disappearing from the scene.
In fact, his retreat is likely to prove a tactical gambit. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Just after learning to his evident amazement that
his presidential ambitions were still alive, thanks to the voters
of Michigan, Senator John McCain issued a curious appeal. ``Don't
fear my campaign, fellow Republican,'' he pleaded, ``join it, join
it.'' Mindful that only 40 percent of all U.S. voters are
Republicans and that anyone who wants to be president must appeal
across party lines, George W. Bush responded with an appeal of his
own, calling on ``Republicans and like-minded independents'' to
support him. Which candidate will capture the hearts _ and votes _
of Republicans? &QL;

 MCCAIN RIPS INTO `INTOLERANT' LEADERS OF RELIGIOUS RIGHT  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the eve of primaries in Virginia and Washington,
Republican presidential candidate John McCain ripped into Christian
televangelists Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell Monday as ``agents
of intolerance'' who ``shame our faith, our party and our
country.''
</P>
<P>
   The blistering broadside _ issued in Virginia Beach, near the
Christian Coalition's headquarters _ was a first for any Republican
presidential candidate and a daring assault on conventional wisdom
that has long held that Christian conservatives are vital to the
GOP base.
</P>
<P>
   As McCain courted the Republican moderates, independents and
Democrats he hopes will support him in Tuesday's GOP primaries, his
rival, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, campaigned in Washington state,
denouncing the Arizona senator's speech at a Seattle news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't lead America to a better tomorrow by calling people
names and pointing fingers,'' Bush said. ``Ronald Reagan didn't
point fingers _ he never played to people's religious fears like
Sen. McCain has shamelessly done, ascribing views to me that I
don't hold.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Democrats, Tuesday's primaries could prove to be a
watershed for former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, who desperately
hopes that the huge amounts of time and money he has spent in
Washington state will give him the first victory he needs to stay
in the race against Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bradley and McCain are hoping for momentum going into Super
Tuesday next week, when California, New York, Ohio and 13 other
states hold primaries.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, polls show Bush and McCain running neck and neck,
and  &LR; with Bradley trailing Gore. In Virginia's GOP primary, Bush
leads McCain.
</P>
<P>
   But last-minute polls have proven unreliable, especially in
states like Washington and Virginia that have open primaries and
large contingents of moderate and independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, McCain held back nothing in his attack on Falwell and
Robertson, calling them right-wing versions of Nation of Islam
leader Louis Farrakhan and the Rev. Al Sharpton, a New York
activist.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also called the televangelists ``mirror images'' of ``the
union bosses who have subordinated the interests of working
families to their own ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the party of Ronald Reagan, not Pat Robertson,'' McCain
declared, as the crowd of more than 2,000 cheered. ``We are the
party of Theodore Roosevelt, not the party of special interests. We
are the party of Abraham Lincoln, not Bob Jones. Join us. Join us.
Join us, and welcome anyone of good faith to our ranks. We should
be, we must be, we will be a party as big as the country we
serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, a Bush supporter, had sent out recorded messages to
Christian conservatives in Michigan before its primary last week
calling McCain's campaign chairman, Warren Rudman, a ``vicious
bigot.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's speech was reminiscent of the 1992 ``Sister Souljah''
campaign speech by then-candidate Bill Clinton, whose denunciation
of the rap artist's gritty lyrics and similar extreme positions on
the left helped him stake out a new political middle.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at McCain's side as he delivered the attack was Gary
Bauer, a Christian conservative who dropped out of the GOP race and
is now supporting McCain. Even as he denounced Robertson, McCain
praised religious values and ``a faith that unites and never
divides.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; High-Risk Strategy
</P>
<P>
   McCain declared himself a staunch conservative and ``proud
Republican,'' while deriding those who would restrict the party to
``card-carrying Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the height of foolishness,'' McCain said, ``to build a
wall around our party in fear that we are so narrowly defined that
new faces and fresh ideas, in accord with our basic principles,
will jeopardize our values.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Dreier, a Southern California Bush supporter who
describes himself as a libertarian Republican, called McCain's
attacks ``very, very unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing more clearly differentiates Bush from McCain than a
statement that likens Pat Robertson to Louis Farrakhan,'' Dreier
said. ``You can have whatever view you want about Pat Robertson,
but we as Republicans are trying to come together.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategist Bill Kristol, who backs McCain, called
McCain's speech ``a very important moment for the Republican
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristol has maintained that the conservative movement is
floundering, citing recent election losses as proof that it no
longer constitutes ``a natural governing majority.'' The sharp GOP
contest, he said, ``is the way political evolutions happen _ you
end up with leaders that were not expected.''
</P>
<P>
   At an evening rally in Alexandria, Va., McCain drew supporters
from across the political spectrum. Many said they were drawn to
McCain's character.
</P>
<P>
   John Ingalls, an Alexandria consultant and Democrat, called the
idea that Democrats are trying to hijack the GOP primaries ``pure
baloney.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We vote our consciences,'' Ingalls said. ``We vote for who we
think is going to be the best for the country. I'm an economic
conservative and a social liberal, and there are huge numbers of us
who are disappointed with both parties. That's what McCain has
picked up on.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Tighe, 32, who called himself a ``very conservative
Republican'' who worked for 1996 GOP nominee Bob Dole, said ``I
truly don't believe we in the United States should be in the
business of coronating princes to be presidents.'' Tighe added that
he thinks McCain ``has a very, very solid record, and his character
is flawless.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Foster, a small businessman who voted for Ross Perot in
1992, liked McCain's stand on paying back the national debt rather
than cutting taxes, and he called Bush ``a Bible thumper.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just after learning to his evident amazement that
his presidential ambitions were still alive, thanks to the voters
of Michigan, Senator John McCain issued a curious appeal. ``Don't
fear my campaign, fellow Republican,'' he pleaded, ``join it, join
it.'' Mindful that only 40 percent of all U.S. voters are
Republicans and that anyone who wants to be president must appeal
across party lines, George W. Bush responded with an appeal of his
own, calling on ``Republicans and like-minded independents'' to
support him. Which candidate will capture the hearts _ and votes _
of Republicans? &QL;

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LOS ANGELES _ There was still about an hour until the opening tap
when Rudy Tomjanovich rounded a corner in the bowels of the Staples
Center and came upon a familiar face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, welcome back, buddy,'' Rudy T said to the tall, almost
regal-looking figure who was leaning against a concrete wall. ``But
I always thought you were too smart to get into this part of the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' said Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, ``just call me a
masochist.''
</P>
<P>
   What you can also call him, finally, is a coach.
</P>
<P>
   After roughly five years of knocking on doors and having most of
them never even open just a crack, the NBA's all-time leading
scorer is at last back on the inside of the game over which he
ruled for so long.
</P>
<P>
   How far inside is still open for debate when you consider the
team to finally throw Abdul-Jabbar a lifeline was the Clippers, who
barely register on the radar of pro sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy to be here and to have been given a chance to
show what I have to offer to the game,'' he said. ``There is no
question that I encountered a great many obstacles along the road
to getting here, and I can't tell you that I have an explanation
for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you could point to any number of reasons why I had
such difficulty even getting interviews over the last four or five
years. I guess the bottom line is a lot of people felt they didn't
need me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had talked to a great number of general managers around the
league, and a lot of them gave me encouragement to go after a job.
But when I made the phone calls, I didn't get very many back. All I
can conclude is that they've all been waiting to see something from
me. However, I can't begin to tell you what that something was.''
</P>
<P>
   Go figure. His sky hook might have been the single greatest
offensive weapon ever in the game as he piled up 38,387
regular-season points and another 5,762 in the playoffs. He was
named to the All-Star team 18 times and won six NBA championships,
and the league he dominated turned its back. Which is like telling
Heidi Klum she isn't worth the film in the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it had to do with his reputation as being strong-willed,
individualistic. Maybe there were too many coaches, general
managers, entire organizations that were intimidated at the thought
of having him work for them. Maybe it had to do with the time he
spent distancing himself from the game following his retirement
after the 1988-89 season.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than pouring himself right back into basketball after his
playing days, Abdul-Jabbar went on the lecture circuit. He wrote
three books and worked as an actor and movie producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to get away,'' he said. ``I was totally, completely,
thoroughly burned out on the game, and I had to give myself a
chance to get my mind back in order. At that time, I needed to
regain my sense of equilibrium.''
</P>
<P>
   But eventually the game he had played for roughly 30 years, the
game that was deep in his blood, resurfaced in the form of an itch
he needed to scratch. So five years after retirement, Abdul-Jabbar
began his quest to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke to the chancellor at UCLA, and there was definite
interest,'' he said. ``But then I spoke to the athletic director,
and there wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also spoke to my (college) coach, John Wooden, and he was
excited, I think, at the idea that I wanted to get into the
profession and try to teach some of the aspects of the game that he
taught me. I just never thought it was going to be so difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his alma mater, the Lakers, with whom
Abdul-Jabbar played the majority of his NBA career and won five NBA
titles, turned a deaf ear. This is a team that had made a habit of
making ex-Lakers with no experience _ Pat Riley, Magic Johnson,
Kurt Rambis _ the head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have to ask them,'' he said. ``I can't explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   So he took his knowledge of the game and his desire to coach to
the remote outpost of Whiteriver, Ariz., and became an unpaid
volunteer coach for the high school team at the White Mountain
Apache Reservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was about more than basketball,'' said Abdul-Jabbar.
``That was about teaching some kids who have a hopeless view of
their lives and what they might accomplish that they can go to
college; they can cope. And it let me get my feet wet.''
</P>
<P>
   Then two weeks ago, the Clippers let him jump back into the
pool. When Chris Ford was fired, new head coach Jim Todd hired a
pair of former greats in Abdul-Jabbar and Dennis Johnson as his
assistants.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind starting at the bottom with the Clippers. Never mind
being the stepchildren to the Lakers in the same brand-new, shiny
building. This is all Abdul-Jabbar has wanted _ a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really fueled my interest was all of the things that I
see lacking in the game today,'' he said. ``It's become a different
game from the time that I retired, and not a better game.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot about the game is not being taught, not being
translated, and as a result what I see is every level of the game
is suffering. It's become all about money and fame and glamour, not
about learning teamwork and what it means to work toward a common
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players today have great size, great agility. But they
don't know what it means to commit themselves to each other, to
play fundamental basketball, to play the kind of defense that wins
championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about money. The money has been taken out of public
schools, and there are no P.E. classes where you learn the basics.
The kids are running to these AAU teams chasing glory. They are
jumping out of college after a year or two, and they arrive in the
NBA not knowing half the things they should know to play in the
league. Frankly, a lot of them are clueless about how to play the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the game the way it was taught to a young
Abdul-Jabbar _ then Lew Alcindor _ by Wooden, the Wizard of
Westwood, at UCLA. Bounce passes. Layups. All of the basics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all have a show-business mentality now,'' Abdul-Jabbar
said. ``It's all about seeing if they can be on Play of the Day.
That's not basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   It may sound odd coming from a member of the Lakers' Showtime
outfit of the '80s. Led by Kareem and Magic, they put glitz in
their five championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a running style, but we were all about taking care
of business, about winning basketball games,'' Abdul-Jabbar said.
``Nobody ever talked about those teams playing great defense, but
we did.''
</P>
<P>
   He is paying his dues as an assistant coach now, staying up late
nights to break down game film, taking a position on the court two
hours before a game to work with the young players. At 7-2, he
stands so tall on the court, his body lean, his bald head gleaming,
his goatee now flecked with gray but his eyes still fiery, intense,
penetrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm enjoying this,``Abdul-Jabbar said. ``Coach Todd has been
great, and this has so far been a wonderful experience. I'm in this
coaching business for the long haul, until further notice. And I do
believe that I have something to offer the game.''
</P>
<P>
   After all these years, finally, someone is willing to listen.

SUPERHEROES ABOUT TO MAKE INTERNET DEBUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON Z. COHEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ From Stan Lee, the creator of Spider-Man and The
X-Men, comes the next innovation in entertainment: the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so it's been around for a while, but the Internet is ripe
for new development, said Peter Paul, co-founder of Stan Lee Media
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   So at 8 Tuesday night, Lee is hosting a giant Hollywood bash to
launch Stanlee.net, the comic book creator's foray into the World
Wide Web as an entertainment medium.
</P>
<P>
   The company says it's the first to have episodic animation
programming designed for distribution on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The main focus of Stanlee.net will be ``The 7th Portal,'' an
online animated series chronicling the adventures of a new cadre of
superheroes _ a group of software beta testers _ trying to save the
world from evil forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that this effort to introduce a high-concept
episodic animated series represents the coming of age of the
Internet as a bona fide and viable entertainment medium that will
be on par with television in its delivery,'' said Paul, whose
previous marketing achievements include making a cultural icon out
of an unemployed, golden-maned romance novel cover model named
Fabio Lanzoni.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is not the first to embrace the Internet as a medium for
entertainment content, said Dan O'Brien, an analyst with
Maryland-based Internet research firm Forrester Research.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Burton is another animator who is taking advantage of the
medium's compatibility with animation.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, who created ``The Nightmare Before Christmas,'' has
signed a deal to create 26 animated episodes for distribution
online.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee is getting out into cyberspace first.
</P>
<P>
   And as data transfer speeds increase, the Internet will grow
into more of an entertainment medium, O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of jockeying going on among various creative
media people,'' he said. ``Heretofore, it's been a communication
medium and an information medium, and to a lesser extent an
e-commerce medium, but not an entertainment medium.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone can repackage comic book content for the Internet age,
Stan ``The Man'' can, said Chris Bleistein, deputy director of the
Massachusetts-based Comic Book Legal Defense Fund, an industry
advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Lee created such comics
franchises as Spider-Man, The Avengers and The X-Men, breathing new
life into the medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once before, Stan Lee revolutionized the comics industry and
set it on its head,'' Bleistein said. ``Everyone's wondering, Can
he do it again?''
</P>
<P>
   Paul thinks so. He's billing tonight's launch as nothing short
of the introduction of an entirely new entertainment medium.
</P>
<P>
   While the Internet has grown into a pervasive source of
information, it hasn't reached its potential as a source of
entertainment with content created exclusively for distribution
online, Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the other studios are repurposing content from other
media,'' he said. ``They will have to follow what we'll be
pioneering.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is a great place for comic book superheroes,
Bleistein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its actually a fairly logical progression. The fact you can
introduce motion and filmic effects on the Internet just increases
the palette that's available for comic creators,'' he said. ``It's
a move the entire industry is beginning to embrace.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Internet, animation is a reasonable first step in its
development into an entertainment outlet, O'Brien said. The current
state of technology is not quite able to handle live video and
sound yet.
</P>
<P>
   But video and sound will eventually be more practical, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That means new players will join the game, and some of them will
win, O'Brien predicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'll find some of the successes coming from outside
the traditional industry,'' he said.

   BERLIN _ The Austrian far-right leader Joerg Haider stunned
political friends and foes alike by announcing Monday that he

danger of Haider, the most successful politician in postwar Austria
and an ambitious chancellor wannabe, disappearing from the scene.
In fact, his retreat is likely to prove a tactical gambit. &QL;

<P>
   BERLIN _ The Austrian far-right leader Joerg Haider stunned
political friends and foes alike by announcing Monday that he
wanted to step down as leader of the Freedom Party. But there is no
danger of Haider, the most successful politician in postwar Austria
and an ambitious chancellor wannabe, disappearing from the scene.
In fact, his retreat is likely to prove a tactical gambit. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Just after learning to his evident amazement that
his presidential ambitions were still alive, thanks to the voters
of Michigan, Senator John McCain issued a curious appeal. ``Don't
fear my campaign, fellow Republican,'' he pleaded, ``join it, join
it.'' Mindful that only 40 percent of all U.S. voters are
Republicans and that anyone who wants to be president must appeal
across party lines, George W. Bush responded with an appeal of his
own, calling on ``Republicans and like-minded independents'' to
support him. Which candidate will capture the hearts _ and votes _
of Republicans? &QL;

BOEING PICKS SENIOR SYSTEMS TO MAKE HIGH-TECH MILITARY RADIO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY CHARLES F. BOSTWICK 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALMDALE, Calif. _ Senior Systems Technology has been picked by
Boeing Co. to manufacture components and assemble a new high-tech
military radio, which company officials say could result in $3
million to $5 million in business annually for five to seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's Information and Communications Systems Division in
Anaheim has an Army contract to build Grenadier Brat radio units
for evaluation, and hopes to get authorization to start low-rate
production later this year, a Boeing official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the program has significant potential,'' said Harvey
Magidow, Senior Systems' director of sales and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Systems doesn't know if additional workers will be needed
at the 18-month-old Palmdale plant. More than 300 workers now work
at the facility, which manufactures electronic devices that range
from very high-speed telecommunications modems to controllers for
irrigation systems.
</P>
<P>
   Hiring depends on the level of production for the radio, which
has drawn interest from NATO nations, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   About three times the size of a cellular phone, the Grenadier
Brat would combine a radio transmitter and receiver with a global
positioning satellite system, allowing an Army commander to track
all his unit's vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing picked SST to manufacture circuit cards, assemble the
radios and test them, said Robert Moses, Boeing subcontracts
manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like they have a pretty good operation,'' Moses said
of the Palmdale plant.

L.A. MAYOR'S FINANCE PLAN STALLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV AND MICHAEL COIT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; L &LR; OS ANGELES _ In the biggest clash yet over power under the
new City Charter, a key council committee stalled a plan Monday
from Mayor Richard Riordan and Controller Rick Tuttle to
consolidate all the city's finances in a single department.
</P>
<P>
   The new charter, which will take effect July 1, creates an
Office of Finance but leaves some discretion on how much power it
will have, prompting weeks of sparring between the mayor, who
claims his plan could save tens of millions of dollars annually,
and the council.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan's plan, backed by Tuttle, came before the council's ad
hoc committee on implementing the new City Charter, in a three-hour
hearing that left key issues unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a great mistake to make all these changes at once
without further study,'' said Councilwoman Laura Chick, chairwoman
of the committee and a candidate for controller. ``The voters
approved a broad framework and asked us to fill in the details.''
</P>
<P>
   Chick asked for a time line on changes, and Councilman Mike
Feuer, a candidate for city attorney, indicated he wants the Budget
and Finance Committee he chairs to look at some of the details.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether the city administrative officer should
retain power in some critical financial jobs not specified in the
charter.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new charter, the city treasurer, with responsibility
for cash management and investment, will move into the Office of
Finance, given authority to take over the city clerk's function of
collecting revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The chief administrative officer retains authority to provide
independent analysis and review and to prepare budgets in what will
be the newly named Office of Administrative and Research Services,
but the charter is silent on functions now under this top
administrator, including estimating revenues, borrowing and
managing risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view this as an opportunity for some bold changes to
streamline government and make changes in the finance functions,''
Deputy Mayor Jennifer Roth said. ``The pieces we have proposed are
in the best interests of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the committee, Riordan and Tuttle recommended
consolidating most financial functions in the new Office of Finance
rather than relegating it ``to being simply a bill collector.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The dispersion of financial functions throughout our city
departments and offices has created an unwieldy and inefficient
system of financial management,'' the two officials say in their
letter.
</P>
<P>
   Under their proposal, authority for revenue-estimating and
long-term financial planning would move from the chief
administrator to the finance office. The controller still is
required to provide an independent estimate of city revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing, a major component of the city's financial operations,
and managing debt would move to the finance office.
</P>
<P>
   Risk management, now spread throughout city government, would be
moved into the finance office. A professional likely would be hired
to oversee workers' compensation, property and liability issues,
and insurance litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the proposal noted that an organization of the
nation's top municipal financial officers rated Los Angeles behind
most other major U.S. cities in administrative cost, efficiency and
use of technology.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles might save tens of millions of dollars on
administrative costs alone if it adopted the best practices of the
nation's other major cities, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   But Chief Administrative Officer Bill Fujioka voiced concern
over the breadth of changes proposed, including the transfer of
functions analyzing the city's debt from his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``This involves a fundamental principle of checks and
balances,'' said Fujioka, who has been at odds with the Mayor's
Office. ``When it comes to revenue forecasting, I believe there is
a role for the CAO to play. To have the same office looking at
revenue and debt management creates a conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee also quarreled with the Mayor's Office on the role
of city lobbyists and who speaks for the city.
</P>
<P>
   The new charter designates the mayor as the spokesman for the
city, with the approval of the council on specific policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Mayor Kelly Martin said she was concerned that a proposal
before the committee was too narrow and would not allow the mayor
to take positions on measures in Sacramento and Washington that
could generate money for the city.
</P>
<P>
   However, the committee said the mayor would be allowed to do so
with the agreement of the City Council's president and subsequent
confirmation by the council.
</P>
<P>
   Martin also said department heads should be required to submit
their positions on legislative matters to the Mayor's Office for a
coordinated response, rather than requiring all information to go
to City Council members at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Erwin Chemerinsky, who chaired the Elected Charter Reform
Commission, however, said the council also needs timely information
to take a position on issues.

ROCKETS HAMMER CLIPPERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As a parting gift for showing up to be smeared by
the Lakers on Sunday, the Houston Rockets were allowed to stick
around for another day and take a few swings at the Los Angeles
Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers _ absolute sweethearts at hospitality _ led with
their chins.
</P>
<P>
   Treating prosperity like a grenade, the home team saw its
winning streak ended at one Monday, snuffed by a 96-77 Rockets
victory in front of 12,940 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   If you only see one Clippers game this season, feel blessed for
missing this beauty. The Clippers missed almost everything,
shooting a franchise-low 26.8 percent from the field. No Houston
starter reached double figures in scoring, but the Rockets rolled,
getting 63 points from their bench.
</P>
<P>
   The program included a pterodactyl routine from Maurice Taylor
(12 points, 3 rebounds), who acknowledged a round of boos by
flapping his arms as he strolled to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers even lost their built-in alibi. Rookie Lamar Odom
is dragging a sore right shoulder around Staples these days and
wasn't expected to play. But Odom, who didn't start, did suit up
and competed like a healthy citizen, contributing 20 points and 10
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   But he and his teammates squeezed off 47 shots in the opening
half and had a 25-percent success rate (a dozen went in), to trail
58-36 at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Beer should be this cold.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor momentarily sabotaged his free-agent audition by missing
13 of his 17 field-goal attempts before he was jeered on the way to
his seat at 7:30 of the fourth quarter. Michael Olowokandi missed 5
of his 6 shots and Eric Piatkowski bricked 6 of 7. Derek Anderson
missed 10 of his 13 offerings and Tyrone Nesby was a toasty 5 of
15.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets (22-35) didn't seem to miss Hakeem Olajuwon (virus)
or suffer from a sub-par effort by monster rookie Steve Francis,
who was 1 for 8 from the field in the opening 24 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers (12-46) really went crazy to open the second half,
trimming the deficit to 16 before their motionless offense and
soft-hearted defense invited Houston to push its advantage to 25.

LEGACY RUNNERS AT L.A. MARATHON
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Running in a marathon race takes some incentive.
Agoura resident Cliff Housego has all the incentive he needs to run
in the L.A. Marathon every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father died of a heart attack at 48, and my father-in-law
died of a heart attack at 51,'' said the 51-year-old who works as a
dance instructor in Thousand Oaks. ``It's very important for me to
stay healthy, because I want to be able to watch my kids' kids grow
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the approximately 21,000 runners who will set out Sunday
morning to conquer the grueling 26.2-mile course, Housego will be
one of 366 ``legacy runners'' to have started and finished all of
the 14 previous Los Angeles Marathons.
</P>
<P>
   Housego celebrates the completion of each marathon by drinking a
margarita and going out for a night of dancing, a task that has
become more daunting each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I was one hurtin' puppy,'' Housego said. ``I
couldn't even locate my car keys, that's how out of it I was, but I
jumped in the Jacuzzi for a few minutes and after that I kept going
all night.''
</P>
<P>
   Valencia resident Michael Bare believes Housego's streak is
something special.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty amazing when you stop and think about it,'' Bare
said. ``There are so many little things that could go wrong, with
injuries or whatever, things that could ruin a lot of streaks, but
there are still a lot of people running.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``legacy runners'' include 66 area residents, and many of
them share a similar pattern. They ran the first marathon, in 1986,
as a means to stay in shape and achieve a goal.
</P>
<P>
   They enjoyed themselves, came back, and before they knew it,
five years had passed.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years, well, why stop now?
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day, my dad reminded me of the first marathon,''
said Barry Leonard, 44, an optometrist who lives in Tarzana. ``My
dad was there videotaping the finish, and on the tape you can hear
him say, 'Boy, that sure was exciting, when's the next one?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of smiled and said, 'You know, that was a great
experience, but I don't see any reason to put myself through that
ever again.' Of course I went back, and now I want to do all of
them,'' Leonard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran the first one when I was 30, and I want to be 65 and say
I ran one every year for 35 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the ``legacy runners'' were recognized in a special
ceremony at Olvera Street, where they each received an award from
Mayor Richard Riordan. They will have a special place in the mass
of humanity Sunday morning, as they will line up right behind the
elite runners near the front of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always look forward to this time of the year,'' said Mickey
De Palo, 53, a recreation program coordinator from Burbank. ``I
know I'm another year older, but when I get on the starting line I
feel as young as ever.''
</P>
<P>
   De Palo will celebrate his 15th anniversary by staying with his
family at the Regal Biltmore Hotel, right in the middle of the
annual marathon festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a parent, I try to be the best role model I can be,'' De
Palo said. ``I have a 9-year-old son, and I hope this shows him
something about dedication, and being able to accomplish anything
you set your mind to, as long as you give it your best effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's a way to make sure I stay in shape and watch my
diet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many participants share De Palo's view that running the Los
Angeles Marathon makes them feel young and helps them maintain a
measure of physical self-discipline in their busy lives.
</P>
<P>
   Health is also of paramount importance to Encino resident Jose
Cadenas, who previously smoked 2 packs of cigarettes per day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the first one just to support a friend who was
running, but I got caught up in the excitement and decided to run
myself,'' Cadenas said. ``My mother-in-law died of lung cancer, so
I realized that it was time to get healthy and do it for my
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the streaks have come close to ending throughout the
years. Bare was diagnosed with a bilateral hernia after the first
marathon, and competed for several years with a neck injury that
caused his arm to go numb when he ran. Two other local runners have
rebounded from serious bicycle injuries to resume running, and at
least one competito expects a pitfall each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a running family joke,'' said Dave Vint of
Newbury Park, who has come down with flu symptoms prior to six of
his 14 marathons. ``I'm normally a pretty healthy person, but it's
almost climactic every year, because people just wait for me to get
sick.''

<P>
   Last month, Bob McNair agreed to pay a record $700 million for a
NFL expansion franchise for Houston. Now, he needs a little help
paying for a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Thanksgiving Day, McNair will begin selling 41,000
Permanent Seat Licenses for the 69,500-seat stadium scheduled to
open in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The licenses -- priced from $600 for an end zone seat and $3,900
for a lower midfield one -- allow the buyer to own the seat as long
as he or she buys season tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Like most other chattel, the owner can sell the licenses, trade
them or bequeath them after death. In other cities, PSLs are so
coveted, they provide contention in divorces.
</P>
<P>
   The money from the licenses will pay for $50 million toward the
cost of the world's first retractable-roof, football-only stadium.
</P>
<P>
   That represents the football team's upfront payment for a
stadium budgeted at $310 million, but which could come in closer to
$350 million.
</P>
<P>
   Groundbreaking for the stadium adjacent to the Astrodome is
slated March 8, when the new team's name will be unveiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one (financing) increment left -- the fan,`` said
North Carolina marketing guru Max Muhleman, who has helped sell
PSLs for other stadiums, including the one in Nashville, home of
the former Houston Oilers, now the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think people will take pride in helping build the finest
football facility ever,`` Muhleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Known as PSLs, the seat licenses have been used with great
success to finance stadiums for the Titans, Cleveland Browns,
Baltimore Ravens, Carolina Panthers and Pittsburgh Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some failures. The NFL Oakland Raiders had
problems selling PSLs for stadium renovations when they moved back
from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But Muhleman said he does not anticipate problems in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost, he said, Houston has a burning desire to regain the
sport after Bud Adams moved his Oilers to Tennessee three seasons
ago. Muhleman noted that more than 7.5 million hits have reached
the new team's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Then there will be the one-of-a-kind stadium, which Muhleman
predicted will attract more than one Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   As part of McNair's enormous franchise fee, NFL officials
pledged to give Houston the 2004 Super Bowl. And because games can
be comfortably watched in the new stadium regardless of the
weather, NFL officials will give it priority with New Orleans,
Phoenix and Miami as preferred locations, Muhleman said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, PSL prices here will be fairly modest and
they will be fewer in number compared with NFL standards.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville, for example, sold PSLs for 85 percent of their seats,
with the prices ranging from $2,500 to $4,500.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the relative scarcity in Houston -- 60 percent --
they should have greater value in future years as owners consider
selling them, Muhleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Names of the founding PSL owners will be etched on a ``wall of
honor`` inside the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Fans who buy their PSLs by Dec. 10 will have first dibs on seat
assignments. Other assignments will be on a first-come, first-serve
basis.
</P>
<P>
   For any Super Bowl here, PSL buyers will be included in a
lottery for a smaller selection of tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers can pay for PSLs in three equal, annual payments,
interest-free. Southwest Bank of Texas, Wells Fargo and Chase Bank
of Texas will offer financing.
</P>
<P>
   If a PSL holder declines to buy season tickets, that fan will
forfeit their seat license.
</P>
<P>
   PSL applications will be available in Chronicle ads starting
Thursday, at www.2002stadiumfund.com on the Internet and in
brochures at participating banks.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 40 percent of the tickets will be sold in the
upper decks on a season or individual game basis. In addition, the
stadium will have pockets of seats below $20 each and an
alcohol-free zone for families.
</P>
<P>
   The Harris County-Houston Sports Authority will chip in at least
$195 million of the stadium's cost through taxes on rental cars and
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, McNair will pay about $4 million and the Houston
Livestock Show and Rodeo $1.5 million in lease and maintenance
payments annually.
</P>
<P>
   The sports authority will collect the revenues from the PSLs to
avoid tax liabilities. If the PSLs are privately issued, the issuer
has to pay income tax on them.
</P>
<P>
   Under McNair's October 1998 letter of agreement with the county,
sports authority and rodeo to build the stadium, $45 million in PSL
revenues would count against design and construction and $5 million
against the concession build-out.
</P>
<P>
   Additional revenues generated by PSLs would be counted against
additional items the football team desires.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Patterson, vice president of McNair's Houston NFL
Holdings, said the PSLs could raise $70 million, with the net
exceeding $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   The letter of agreement is under reconsideration as the cost
escalates, but McNair has said he will not pay any costs above what
he agreed to in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Authority Finance Chairman Ric Campo said there is
currently no consideration about using excess PSL revenues for the
additional stadium costs.

<P>
   Last month, Bob McNair agreed to pay a record $700 million for a
NFL expansion franchise for Houston. Now, he needs a little help
paying for a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Thanksgiving Day, McNair will begin selling 41,000
Permanent Seat Licenses for the 69,500-seat stadium scheduled to
open in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The licenses -- priced from $600 for an end zone seat and $3,900
for a lower midfield one -- allow the buyer to own the seat as long
as he or she buys season tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Like most other chattel, the owner can sell the licenses, trade
them or bequeath them after death. In other cities, PSLs are so
coveted, they provide contention in divorces.
</P>
<P>
   The money from the licenses will pay for $50 million toward the
cost of the world's first retractable-roof, football-only stadium.
</P>
<P>
   That represents the football team's upfront payment for a
stadium budgeted at $310 million, but which could come in closer to
$350 million.
</P>
<P>
   Groundbreaking for the stadium adjacent to the Astrodome is
slated March 8, when the new team's name will be unveiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one (financing) increment left -- the fan,`` said
North Carolina marketing guru Max Muhleman, who has helped sell
PSLs for other stadiums, including the one in Nashville, home of
the former Houston Oilers, now the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think people will take pride in helping build the finest
football facility ever,`` Muhleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Known as PSLs, the seat licenses have been used with great
success to finance stadiums for the Titans, Cleveland Browns,
Baltimore Ravens, Carolina Panthers and Pittsburgh Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some failures. The NFL Oakland Raiders had
problems selling PSLs for stadium renovations when they moved back
from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But Muhleman said he does not anticipate problems in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost, he said, Houston has a burning desire to regain the
sport after Bud Adams moved his Oilers to Tennessee three seasons
ago. Muhleman noted that more than 7.5 million hits have reached
the new team's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Then there will be the one-of-a-kind stadium, which Muhleman
predicted will attract more than one Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   As part of McNair's enormous franchise fee, NFL officials
pledged to give Houston the 2004 Super Bowl. And because games can
be comfortably watched in the new stadium regardless of the
weather, NFL officials will give it priority with New Orleans,
Phoenix and Miami as preferred locations, Muhleman said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, PSL prices here will be fairly modest and
they will be fewer in number compared with NFL standards.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville, for example, sold PSLs for 85 percent of their seats,
with the prices ranging from $2,500 to $4,500.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the relative scarcity in Houston -- 60 percent --
they should have greater value in future years as owners consider
selling them, Muhleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Names of the founding PSL owners will be etched on a ``wall of
honor`` inside the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Fans who buy their PSLs by Dec. 10 will have first dibs on seat
assignments. Other assignments will be on a first-come, first-serve
basis.
</P>
<P>
   For any Super Bowl here, PSL buyers will be included in a
lottery for a smaller selection of tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers can pay for PSLs in three equal, annual payments,
interest-free. Southwest Bank of Texas, Wells Fargo and Chase Bank
of Texas will offer financing.
</P>
<P>
   If a PSL holder declines to buy season tickets, that fan will
forfeit their seat license.
</P>
<P>
   PSL applications will be available in Chronicle ads starting
Thursday, at www.2002stadiumfund.com on the Internet and in
brochures at participating banks.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 40 percent of the tickets will be sold in the
upper decks on a season or individual game basis. In addition, the
stadium will have pockets of seats below $20 each and an
alcohol-free zone for families.
</P>
<P>
   The Harris County-Houston Sports Authority will chip in at least
$195 million of the stadium's cost through taxes on rental cars and
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, McNair will pay about $4 million and the Houston
Livestock Show and Rodeo $1.5 million in lease and maintenance
payments annually.
</P>
<P>
   The sports authority will collect the revenues from the PSLs to
avoid tax liabilities. If the PSLs are privately issued, the issuer
has to pay income tax on them.
</P>
<P>
   Under McNair's October 1998 letter of agreement with the county,
sports authority and rodeo to build the stadium, $45 million in PSL
revenues would count against design and construction and $5 million
against the concession build-out.
</P>
<P>
   Additional revenues generated by PSLs would be counted against
additional items the football team desires.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Patterson, vice president of McNair's Houston NFL
Holdings, said the PSLs could raise $70 million, with the net
exceeding $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   The letter of agreement is under reconsideration as the cost

DISPUTE MAY LEAD ABC AFFILIATE BEING PULLED OFF TIME WARNER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MIKE McDANIEL 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Making Houston its battleground for what appears to be
a nationwide showdown, ABC said late Monday that its local
affiliate will pull its signal from the Time Warner cable system
this week, a move that will affect as many as 680,000 subscribers
who receive KTRK-TV from that service.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is retransmission consent, part of the 1992 Cable TV
Act that authorizes cable companies to collect and transmit signals
of broadcast channels. It is known as the ``must-carry rule,'' but
ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox instead choose to negotiate cable carriage.
</P>
<P>
   Channel 13's retransmission consent agreement with Time Warner
expired Dec. 31, as did agreements involving ABC-owned stations in
New York, Los Angeles, Raleigh-Durham, N.C., and Toledo, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, Time Warner Communications and Disney-owned ABC
agreed to two contract extensions to negotiate a new retransmission
agreement. But now ABC claims that Time Warner has stopped
negotiating, while Time Warner says a deal was in place, then
rejected when Disney/ABC effectively increased its price by $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   ABC and Time Warner have agreed to a 30-day extension on the
retransmission agreements in the other markets, but ABC has decided
to fight Time Warner in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   So fractious has the situation become, the two sides could not
agree Monday on when the extended contract ends. Time Warner says
12:01 a.m. Thursday, meaning Channel 13 will be dropped as of then.
Channel 13 says 12:01 a.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've given Time Warner every opportunity to continue
negotiating in good faith, but they refuse to discuss a fair
deal,'' said Henry Florsheim, KTRK general manager and president.
</P>
<P>
   The station decided Monday to launch a public campaign to inform
viewers of the situation. It said it is close to a deal with
DirecTV and EchoStar to make satellite dishes more easily available
to Houston customers. Details were still being worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner will offer its cable customers free antennas so
Channel 13 viewers can pick the KTRK signal off the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney is holding Houston hostage to try and force us to
accept a deal that would raise cable prices for our Houston
customers,'' said Ron McMillan, president of Time Warner-Houston.
``Mickey Mouse doesn't like Houston, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, broadcasters have worked out retransmission
consents by getting cable companies to carry sister channels. Cable
carriage of ESPN2, for example, was the bargaining chip in a
previous ABC and Time Warner negotiation. ESPN2 and ABC are owned
by Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the deal discussed since January were sketchy. ABC
wants Time Warner to carry Toon Disney and a 24-hour serial
channel, SoapNet, in exchange for Time Warner being able to carry
Channel 13, the most-watched station in Houston. (Ironically,
Houston was the market in which SoapNet was tested last fall.
According to ABC, it was well-received here.)
</P>
<P>
   The deal also asks that Time Warner move the Disney Channel from
premium to basic cable.
</P>
<P>
   McMillan says the deal would force Toon Disney and the Disney
Channel on customers who do not want them _ and the costs of those
services would be passed on to them, as well.
</P>
<P>
   McMillan said Time Warner had a written agreement with Disney in
January but that Disney changed its mind and requested another deal
that would have cost the cable company an additional $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney has refused to modify its demands,'' he said. ``In
Texas, a deal is a deal, but apparently in the wonderful world of
Disney, a deal is just a fairy tale.''
</P>
<P>
   Florsheim disputes the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time Warner's numbers are the fairy tale,'' he said. ``There
was no deal. Time Warner should come back to the table instead of
issuing misleading information.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC believes Time Warner, which owns such cable networks as CNN,
Cartoon Network, TBS and TNT, is being discriminatory about its
channel pickups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're offering competing programming, and they're refusing to
give us fair value for that programming,'' said Alan Braverman, ABC
senior vice president and general consul. ``When you reach the
point when you believe no progress can be made, you have to stand
up and say we have a right to have fair value for our product, we
have a right to have nondiscriminatory access to viewers,
particularly if we have a compelling product.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston was chosen as the battleground because it would be the
least disruptive of the five cities, Braverman said. Houston's
cable penetration is less than in the other markets (about 57
percent here compared with 67 percent nationally).
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney is trying to make an example of Houston just to bring
the rest of the country to heel,'' McMillan said. ``If I were an
advertiser on Channel 13, I'd ask them about the refunds for the
more than 660,000 (Time Warner's figures) viewers they may not
reach anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The specifics are not critical; there are a number of issues
on the table,'' Florsheim said. ``The big issue is that we're not
talking to them at all. It is our hope that we can get the talks
started again.''

   Last month, Bob McNair agreed to pay a record $700 million for a
NFL expansion franchise for Houston. Now, he needs a little help
paying for a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Thanksgiving Day, McNair will begin selling 41,000
Permanent Seat Licenses for the 69,500-seat stadium scheduled to
open in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The licenses -- priced from $600 for an end zone seat and $3,900
for a lower midfield one -- allow the buyer to own the seat as long
as he or she buys season tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Like most other chattel, the owner can sell the licenses, trade
them or bequeath them after death. In other cities, PSLs are so
coveted, they provide contention in divorces.
</P>
<P>
   The money from the licenses will pay for $50 million toward the
cost of the world's first retractable-roof, football-only stadium.
</P>
<P>
   That represents the football team's upfront payment for a
stadium budgeted at $310 million, but which could come in closer to
$350 million.
</P>
<P>
   Groundbreaking for the stadium adjacent to the Astrodome is
slated March 8, when the new team's name will be unveiled.

<P>
   ``There's one (financing) increment left -- the fan,`` said
North Carolina marketing guru Max Muhleman, who has helped sell
PSLs for other stadiums, including the one in Nashville, home of
the former Houston Oilers, now the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think people will take pride in helping build the finest
football facility ever,`` Muhleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Known as PSLs, the seat licenses have been used with great
success to finance stadiums for the Titans, Cleveland Browns,
Baltimore Ravens, Carolina Panthers and Pittsburgh Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some failures. The NFL Oakland Raiders had
problems selling PSLs for stadium renovations when they moved back
from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But Muhleman said he does not anticipate problems in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost, he said, Houston has a burning desire to regain the
sport after Bud Adams moved his Oilers to Tennessee three seasons
ago. Muhleman noted that more than 7.5 million hits have reached
the new team's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Then there will be the one-of-a-kind stadium, which Muhleman
predicted will attract more than one Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   As part of McNair's enormous franchise fee, NFL officials
pledged to give Houston the 2004 Super Bowl. And because games can
be comfortably watched in the new stadium regardless of the
weather, NFL officials will give it priority with New Orleans,
Phoenix and Miami as preferred locations, Muhleman said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, PSL prices here will be fairly modest and
they will be fewer in number compared with NFL standards.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville, for example, sold PSLs for 85 percent of their seats,
with the prices ranging from $2,500 to $4,500.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the relative scarcity in Houston -- 60 percent --
they should have greater value in future years as owners consider
selling them, Muhleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Names of the founding PSL owners will be etched on a ``wall of
honor`` inside the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Fans who buy their PSLs by Dec. 10 will have first dibs on seat
assignments. Other assignments will be on a first-come, first-serve
basis.
</P>
<P>
   For any Super Bowl here, PSL buyers will be included in a
lottery for a smaller selection of tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers can pay for PSLs in three equal, annual payments,
interest-free. Southwest Bank of Texas, Wells Fargo and Chase Bank
of Texas will offer financing.
</P>
<P>
   If a PSL holder declines to buy season tickets, that fan will
forfeit their seat license.
</P>
<P>
   PSL applications will be available in Chronicle ads starting
Thursday, at www.2002stadiumfund.com on the Internet and in
brochures at participating banks.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 40 percent of the tickets will be sold in the
upper decks on a season or individual game basis. In addition, the
stadium will have pockets of seats below $20 each and an
alcohol-free zone for families.
</P>
<P>
   The Harris County-Houston Sports Authority will chip in at least
$195 million of the stadium's cost through taxes on rental cars and
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, McNair will pay about $4 million and the Houston
Livestock Show and Rodeo $1.5 million in lease and maintenance
payments annually.
</P>
<P>
   The sports authority will collect the revenues from the PSLs to
avoid tax liabilities. If the PSLs are privately issued, the issuer
has to pay income tax on them.
</P>
<P>
   Under McNair's October 1998 letter of agreement with the county,
sports authority and rodeo to build the stadium, $45 million in PSL
revenues would count against design and construction and $5 million
against the concession build-out.
</P>
<P>
   Additional revenues generated by PSLs would be counted against
additional items the football team desires.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Patterson, vice president of McNair's Houston NFL
Holdings, said the PSLs could raise $70 million, with the net
exceeding $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   The letter of agreement is under reconsideration as the cost
escalates, but McNair has said he will not pay any costs above what
he agreed to in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Authority Finance Chairman Ric Campo said there is
currently no consideration about using excess PSL revenues for the
additional stadium costs.

<P>
   Last month, Bob McNair agreed to pay a record $700 million for a
NFL expansion franchise for Houston. Now, he needs a little help
paying for a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Thanksgiving Day, McNair will begin selling 41,000
Permanent Seat Licenses for the 69,500-seat stadium scheduled to
open in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The licenses -- priced from $600 for an end zone seat and $3,900
for a lower midfield one -- allow the buyer to own the seat as long
as he or she buys season tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Like most other chattel, the owner can sell the licenses, trade
them or bequeath them after death. In other cities, PSLs are so
coveted, they provide contention in divorces.
</P>
<P>
   The money from the licenses will pay for $50 million toward the
cost of the world's first retractable-roof, football-only stadium.
</P>
<P>
   That represents the football team's upfront payment for a
stadium budgeted at $310 million, but which could come in closer to
$350 million.
</P>
<P>
   Groundbreaking for the stadium adjacent to the Astrodome is
slated March 8, when the new team's name will be unveiled.

<P>
   Buyers can pay for PSLs in three equal, annual payments,
interest-free. Southwest Bank of Texas, Wells Fargo and Chase Bank
of Texas will offer financing.
</P>
<P>
   If a PSL holder declines to buy season tickets, that fan will
forfeit their seat license.
</P>
<P>
   PSL applications will be available in Chronicle ads starting
Thursday, at www.2002stadiumfund.com on the Internet and in
brochures at participating banks.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 40 percent of the tickets will be sold in the
upper decks on a season or individual game basis. In addition, the
stadium will have pockets of seats below $20 each and an
alcohol-free zone for families.
</P>
<P>
   The Harris County-Houston Sports Authority will chip in at least
$195 million of the stadium's cost through taxes on rental cars and
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, McNair will pay about $4 million and the Houston
Livestock Show and Rodeo $1.5 million in lease and maintenance
payments annually.
</P>
<P>
   The sports authority will collect the revenues from the PSLs to
avoid tax liabilities. If the PSLs are privately issued, the issuer
has to pay income tax on them.
</P>
<P>
   Under McNair's October 1998 letter of agreement with the county,
sports authority and rodeo to build the stadium, $45 million in PSL
revenues would count against design and construction and $5 million
against the concession build-out.
</P>
<P>
   Additional revenues generated by PSLs would be counted against
additional items the football team desires.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Patterson, vice president of McNair's Houston NFL
Holdings, said the PSLs could raise $70 million, with the net
exceeding $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   The letter of agreement is under reconsideration as the cost
escalates, but McNair has said he will not pay any costs above what
he agreed to in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Authority Finance Chairman Ric Campo said there is
currently no consideration about using excess PSL revenues for the
additional stadium costs.

 &HT;    CLINTON SHOOTS FOR GUN CONTROL, BUT FOES SAY HE'S OFF TARGET

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton keeps talking about guns.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few weeks, the White House has discussed gun
shows, gun locks, gun clips, gun dealers, gun tracing, gun
licenses, gun accidents, gun prosecutions, gun safety courses, guns
in schools and guns in public housing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has spoken about the recent shooting deaths of high
schoolers in Washington, D.C. and in Littleton, Colo. He honored
Jim Brady, who suffered a gunshot wound to the head in the 1981
attempted assassination of President Reagan. And in his State of
the Union address last month, Clinton invited the Colorado father
of a victim of the Columbine High School massacre as his personal
guest.
</P>
<P>
   Some would call it a full court press. With less than a year
left in his presidency, Clinton is pushing hard for ``common
sense'' gun control measures.
</P>
<P>
   But some East Texas Democrats don't see any ``common sense'' in
the proposals . Reps. Max Sandlin of Marhsall and Jim Turner of
Crockett, oppose many of Clinton's gun-related objectives this
year. Among them: mandatory safety locks on handguns and a ban on
importing large capacity ammunition clips or ``magazines.'' In
addition, Rep. Ralph Hall, of Rockwall, joins them in opposing a
72-hour waiting period for buyers at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration is absolutely wrong on this issue,''
Sandlin said. ``When they're wrong, I refuse to support them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandlin, a longtime hunter and fisherman who owns ``15 to 20''
guns, said his constituents have grown up around firearms and are
not afraid of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view guns as a part of sports and part of protecting our
homes,'' he said. ``We have a constitutional right to bear weapons
and that's the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding another Clinton proposal to create a state-based
licensing system for all handgun purchasers, Sandlin said, ``If the
administration wants a picture of people purchasing weapons in
Texas, they'd better load up a Polaroid and come down here because
that's the only way they're going to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall and Turner also own firearms and represent heavily rural
districts. All three lawmakers receive money from the National
Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of firearms for sporting purposes in East Texas is
just part of the culture,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In urban America I think there is a great deal of fear of
firearms. . .that may be the most significant difference between
rural and urban America.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Waco, said elected officials might make
a mistake assuming that the vast majority of Texans side with the
NRA in opposing child safety locks and gun show background checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have confidence that the majority of my constituents want to
protect their children from gun accidents and their families from
criminals being able to easily buy guns at gun shows,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, who is a hunter and owns a shotgun and a pistol, said
he supports the NRA on some issues but not when it comes to
``common sense gun safety legislation that will save lives.''
</P>
<P>
   On those issues, ``I feel comfortable siding with the mothers
and fathers in this district rather than the NRA,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Edwards' district was the scene of the largest mass
murder in the nation's history when a gunman killed 22 people at a
Luby's cafeteria in Killeen.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the massacre, Congress was scheduled to vote on a
sweeping ban on several types of firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It caused me to search my conscience. What did I truly feel
was the right thing to do?'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   He decided to vote in favor of banning 19 types of assault
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not used by hunters or families but were used,
according to the FBI, by thugs, and drug dealers and organized
criminals to efficiently kill people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Edwards is considered a moderate Democrat in Congress, his
East Texas colleagues _ Sandlin, Hall and Turner _ are more
conservative. All three belong to the Blue Dog Caucus, a group of
Democrats who tend to cast conservative votes on taxes, budgets and
other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Their opposition to several gun control proposals could prove a
key element in upcoming House debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be a very important cog,'' said Sandlin. ``With a close
vote, I think it's very clear that the Texans _ especially the Blue
Dogs _ will vote pro-constitution, pro-gun and hopefully, that will
make the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, gun control took the spotlight in Congress after
Columbine High School students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold
horrified the nation by using high-powered guns to murder 12
students and a teacher before killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy and other highly-publicized school shootings had a
great impact on the public and lawmakers despite the fact that gun
homicides have dropped over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, gun
homicides in the United States dropped from 14,740 in 1995 to
10,976 in 1998. Homicides committed by teens between the ages of 14
and 17 also dropped from 2,692 in 1995 to 1,433 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control proponents argue that the numbers are still
staggering and that gun violence will only drop significantly when
the number of firearms is reduced.
</P>
<P>
   A month after the Columbine shooting, the Senate stunned the
powerful gun lobby and voted for a juvenile justice bill which
included stricter background checks on buyers at gun shows. The
50-50 vote allowed Vice President Al Gore to cast an unusual
tie-breaking vote. Both Texas senators opposed the measure.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the bill has been stuck in a House-Senate conference
committee that is trying to resolve differences. Last week,
Republicans said they are considering stripping the bill of the
controversial gun control provisions in an effort to pass the
underlying $1.5 billion bill, which would impose stiffer penalties
on teens convicted of weapons crimes, as well as allow state
governments to post the Ten Commandments in public buildings.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Senate Democrats are expected to offer gun
control amendments to one of 13 pending appropriations bills
although the details are still unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates and most Democrats say that the GOP will
get hammered at the polls if it fails to pass some form of gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   But some Texas Democrats wouldn't mind that at all _ especially
if lawmakers dump a proposed 72-hour waiting period to purchase
firearms at gun shows .
</P>
<P>
   The gun show waiting period is probably the most controversial
gun control provision this year. Some lawmakers are proposing a
shorter one-day wait while others, like Sandlin, prefer some kind
of instant check.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton weighed in on the issue earlier this month, saying that
the waiting period is necessary to provide a ``cooling-off period''
for somebody ``who is really hot'' and ``buys a gun with a bad
intent.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clinton said the waiting period must be long enough
to allow gun sellers to make the checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you move away from 72 hours to a shorter period, then the
question is, since so many of these gun shows occur on the weekend,
will there be access to the records to do the check,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   In response to that dilemma, Sandlin said, ``I don't believe
that we trample on the Constitution because someone may be out of
pocket on the weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want my family or any other family in Central Texas
exposed to a murderer who has gotten out of prison and goes to a
gun show and buys as many guns as he can afford without a criminal
background check,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   In light of their opposition to gun control proposals, Sandlin,
Hall and Turner are among the Democrats who receive campaign
contributions from the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   In the two years leading up to his 1998 election, Sandlin
received $14,400 from the NRA. That was more than any other Texas
House member, including powerful Republicans such as Majority
Leader Dick Armey of Irving and Majority Whip Tom Delay of Sugar
Land, who each received $9,900 from the group.
</P>
<P>
   Turner and Hall also benefit from NRA dollars. Turner received
$9,900 from the group in the last election cycle and has received
$4,950 for his latest reelection bid. Hall received $3,500 last
time and at least $2,000 for this year's election. Sandlin's
coffers include $3,000 in NRA contributions for his latest race.
</P>
<P>
   Much like the NRA, Turner believes that the solution to gun
violence lies in enforcing current laws instead of creating new
ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could get the guns out of the hands of convicted felons
who are walking around on parole and on probation in this country,
we would eliminate a lot of the problems that we're seeing with
regard to gun violence,'' he said. ``The law already prohibits
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards declined to comment on the opinions of his East Texas
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll let them speak for themselves,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
   Some would call it a full court press. With less than a year
left in his presidency, Clinton is pushing hard for ``common
sense'' gun control measures.
</P>
<P>
   But some North Carolina lawmakers don't see any ``common sense''
in the proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in my district have great respect for the Bible and
Constitution,'' said GOP Rep. Walter Jones. ``They have the belief
that if they are law-abiding citizens they have the right to
purchase a gun and hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he does not think he could support the president's
proposal to require background checks at gun shows or to require
safety locks on handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to say it, but I have to be very leery of any proposal
from this administration. I think too many times these proposals
are made for political gain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who represents a largely rural district, said his
constituents are very worried about gun control and believe the
proposals punish honest citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In some states, such as North Carolina and Texas, several
Democrats are also concerned about Clinton's gun control wish list.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Etheridge, D-N.C., said current gun laws need to be
enforced before adopting new legislation _ a mantra commonly cited
by the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first and best option is enforcing the laws on the
books,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Guns should be kept away from children, from criminals and out
of schools, he said, adding that existing laws should be enough to
meet those goals.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, the president's proposals to hire additional
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) agents and make money
available to hire special gun prosecutors may be useful, Etheridge
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, many House members wonder if any gun issues will come
before the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if in the climate of this year we feel confident
that the Republicans will take up the president's agenda,'' said
Etheridge spokesman Brad Woodhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Since action on Clinton's gun control agenda is unlikely,
Etheridge has not spent a lot of time thinking about requiring
safety locks on firearms or a ban on importing large capacity
ammunition clips or ``magazines,'' Woodhouse said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, gun control took the spotlight in Congress after
Columbine High School students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold
horrified the nation by using high-powered guns to murder 12
students and a teacher before killing themselves.

homicides in the United States dropped from 14,740 in 1995 to
10,976 in 1998. Homicides committed by teens between the ages of 14
and 17 also dropped from 2,692 in 1995 to 1,433 in 1998.
</P>

the number of firearms is reduced.

governments to post the Ten Commandments in public buildings.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Senate Democrats are expected to offer gun
control amendments to one of 13 pending appropriations bills
although the details are still unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Eva Clayton, D-N.C., said that some of Clinton's gun
proposals do have a chance of passing this year.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the Republican-led Congress to take up the president's
gun control agenda will be tough, but not impossible, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think because this is an important issue people will
want to appear to be responsible and some of this will be included
in the budgeting process,'' she said. The development of tracing
technology and hiring additional ATF agents and gun prosecutors
stand the best chance, she said. Clayton said she readily supports
Clinton's proposals to ban importing large capacity ammo clips,
require safety locks, set waiting periods for buyers and have
firearms registration.
</P>
<P>
   Her stand on gun control has not been popular with some of her
constituents, friends and family members who are either hunters or
gun owners.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton argues that no one complains about rights violations
when they are licensed to drive vehicles, to hunt or to perform
other tasks. So why should the licensing of firearms be a
constitutional violation, she asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I am at an airport there are security measures and if
something sounds then they floss me down with the (metal detector)
wand,'' she said. ``I may grumble but I realize it's for the safety
of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates and most Democrats say that the GOP will
get hammered at the polls if it fails to pass some form of gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   But some North Carolina House members wouldn't mind that at all
_ especially if lawmakers abandon a proposed 72-hour waiting period
to purchase firearms at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   The gun show waiting period is probably the most controversial
gun control provision this year. Some lawmakers are proposing a
shorter one-day wait while others prefer some kind of instant
check.
</P>
<P>
   Common sense should prevail when writing any waiting period
legislation, Clayton said.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on location and available technology, some gun show
sellers may be able to perform 24 or 48 hour background checks
while others may need to wait longer, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton also questions whether purchasers of shotguns and rifles
need the type of background examination a handgun purchaser would,
since handguns are used in the majority of violent gun crime.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton weighed in on the issue earlier this month, saying that
the waiting period is necessary to provide a ``cooling-off period''
for somebody ``who is really hot'' and ``buys a gun with a bad
intent.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clinton said the waiting period must be long enough
to allow gun sellers to make the checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you move away from 72 hours to a shorter period, then the
question is, since so many of these gun shows occur on the weekend,
will there be access to the records to do the check,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he has attended several gun shows in Greenville and
Jacksonville. People there are collectors, not criminals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In light of his views, Jones receives support from the National
Rifle Association, which contributed $6,000 to his 1998 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations on both sides of the gun control debate
contributed $41,800 to 1998 congressional candidates from North
Carolina, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a
nonpartisan watchdog group that tabulates campaign finance reports.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA contributed $34,800 to eight candidates and Handgun
Control Inc., the nation's largest pro-gun control group,
contributed $7,000 to two candidates, including $3,000 to Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   Etheridge received no money from either side.
</P>
<P>
   So far, for this year's election, the NRA has spent $16,000 in
the state on congressional candidates and Handgun Control Inc. has
spent no money.

 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The National Rifle Association, long known for its
formidable lobbying in Congress, has developed an equally
impressive Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Hunters, collectors and gun enthusiasts of all kinds can browse
through dozens of links at www.nra.org _ to learn about gun safety
courses, gun-related legislation in Congress, NRA history and the
National Firearms Museum in Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the site has several shopping options for
``everything the Second Amendment enthusiast needs to show their
support,'' such as clothing, decals, bags and books. It even sells
bumper stickers that say ``My President is Charlton Heston'' _ a
reference to the acclaimed actor who currently heads the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The site also offers a ``Bill of Rights pewter belt buckle,'' a
``ladies collegiate style ring with synthetic gemstones'' to
reflect a members' status, and an infant bib with a picture on it
of toy wooden blocks spelling ``NRA.''
</P>
<P>
   The site also includes information about gun safety education
for adults and children, including several programs featuring
cartoon mascot Eddie Eagle, who is never shown touching a firearm,
the site says.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the NRA points out that Eddie Eagle does not
promote firearm ownership or use and is not affiliated with any
firearm or ammunition manufacturers. On the site, law enforcement
agencies can order a costume of the brown and white bald eagle
mascot for $2,650.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA Website also offers details on making contributions
online, donating firearms, donating land or leaving a gift for the
NRA in a will. And it allows people to sign up for membership and
to send the group gun-related stories such as instances when ``a
child heeded Eddie Eagle's message and avoided potential danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Those on the other end of the gun-related political spectrum are
also taking to the Internet to further their cause.
</P>
<P>
   Handgun Control, Inc., the leading gun control advocate group,
has a site at www.handguncontrol.org _ with information on
legislation, lawsuits involving the gun industry and statistics on
gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   While far less polished and elaborate than the NRA site, the
Handgun Control page does have links to state and national gun
control groups and detailed information on federal and state gun
laws.
</P>
<P>
   It also sports several gun-related essays with titles such as
``the NRA's Second Amendment myth'' and ``Who needs an AK-47 to go
duck hunting?''
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, one common theme between the NRA Website and
that of Handgun Control, Inc. _ they are both decorated in
patriotic red, white and blue.

<P>
   Last month, Bob McNair agreed to pay a record $700 million for a
NFL expansion franchise for Houston. Now, he needs a little help
paying for a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Thanksgiving Day, McNair will begin selling 41,000
Permanent Seat Licenses for the 69,500-seat stadium scheduled to
open in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The licenses -- priced from $600 for an end zone seat and $3,900
for a lower midfield one -- allow the buyer to own the seat as long
as he or she buys season tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Like most other chattel, the owner can sell the licenses, trade
them or bequeath them after death. In other cities, PSLs are so
coveted, they provide contention in divorces.
</P>
<P>
   The money from the licenses will pay for $50 million toward the
cost of the world's first retractable-roof, football-only stadium.
</P>
<P>
   That represents the football team's upfront payment for a
stadium budgeted at $310 million, but which could come in closer to
$350 million.
</P>
<P>
   Groundbreaking for the stadium adjacent to the Astrodome is
slated March 8, when the new team's name will be unveiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one (financing) increment left -- the fan,`` said
North Carolina marketing guru Max Muhleman, who has helped sell
PSLs for other stadiums, including the one in Nashville, home of
the former Houston Oilers, now the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think people will take pride in helping build the finest
football facility ever,`` Muhleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Known as PSLs, the seat licenses have been used with great
success to finance stadiums for the Titans, Cleveland Browns,
Baltimore Ravens, Carolina Panthers and Pittsburgh Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some failures. The NFL Oakland Raiders had
problems selling PSLs for stadium renovations when they moved back
from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But Muhleman said he does not anticipate problems in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost, he said, Houston has a burning desire to regain the
sport after Bud Adams moved his Oilers to Tennessee three seasons
ago. Muhleman noted that more than 7.5 million hits have reached
the new team's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Then there will be the one-of-a-kind stadium, which Muhleman
predicted will attract more than one Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   As part of McNair's enormous franchise fee, NFL officials
pledged to give Houston the 2004 Super Bowl. And because games can
be comfortably watched in the new stadium regardless of the
weather, NFL officials will give it priority with New Orleans,
Phoenix and Miami as preferred locations, Muhleman said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, PSL prices here will be fairly modest and
they will be fewer in number compared with NFL standards.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville, for example, sold PSLs for 85 percent of their seats,
with the prices ranging from $2,500 to $4,500.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the relative scarcity in Houston -- 60 percent --
they should have greater value in future years as owners consider
selling them, Muhleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Names of the founding PSL owners will be etched on a ``wall of
honor`` inside the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Fans who buy their PSLs by Dec. 10 will have first dibs on seat
assignments. Other assignments will be on a first-come, first-serve
basis.
</P>
<P>
   For any Super Bowl here, PSL buyers will be included in a
lottery for a smaller selection of tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers can pay for PSLs in three equal, annual payments,
interest-free. Southwest Bank of Texas, Wells Fargo and Chase Bank
of Texas will offer financing.
</P>
<P>
   If a PSL holder declines to buy season tickets, that fan will
forfeit their seat license.
</P>
<P>
   PSL applications will be available in Chronicle ads starting
Thursday, at www.2002stadiumfund.com on the Internet and in
brochures at participating banks.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 40 percent of the tickets will be sold in the
upper decks on a season or individual game basis. In addition, the
stadium will have pockets of seats below $20 each and an
alcohol-free zone for families.
</P>
<P>
   The Harris County-Houston Sports Authority will chip in at least
$195 million of the stadium's cost through taxes on rental cars and
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, McNair will pay about $4 million and the Houston
Livestock Show and Rodeo $1.5 million in lease and maintenance
payments annually.
</P>
<P>
   The sports authority will collect the revenues from the PSLs to
avoid tax liabilities. If the PSLs are privately issued, the issuer
has to pay income tax on them.
</P>
<P>
   Under McNair's October 1998 letter of agreement with the county,
sports authority and rodeo to build the stadium, $45 million in PSL
revenues would count against design and construction and $5 million
against the concession build-out.
</P>
<P>
   Additional revenues generated by PSLs would be counted against
additional items the football team desires.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Patterson, vice president of McNair's Houston NFL
Holdings, said the PSLs could raise $70 million, with the net
exceeding $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   The letter of agreement is under reconsideration as the cost
escalates, but McNair has said he will not pay any costs above what
he agreed to in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Authority Finance Chairman Ric Campo said there is
currently no consideration about using excess PSL revenues for the
additional stadium costs.

</P>
<P>
   Then there will be the one-of-a-kind stadium, which Muhleman
predicted will attract more than one Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   As part of McNair's enormous franchise fee, NFL officials
pledged to give Houston the 2004 Super Bowl. And because games can
be comfortably watched in the new stadium regardless of the
weather, NFL officials will give it priority with New Orleans,
Phoenix and Miami as preferred locations, Muhleman said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, PSL prices here will be fairly modest and
they will be fewer in number compared with NFL standards.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville, for example, sold PSLs for 85 percent of their seats,
with the prices ranging from $2,500 to $4,500.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the relative scarcity in Houston -- 60 percent --
they should have greater value in future years as owners consider
selling them, Muhleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Names of the founding PSL owners will be etched on a ``wall of
honor`` inside the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Fans who buy their PSLs by Dec. 10 will have first dibs on seat
assignments. Other assignments will be on a first-come, first-serve
basis.
</P>
<P>
   For any Super Bowl here, PSL buyers will be included in a
lottery for a smaller selection of tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers can pay for PSLs in three equal, annual payments,
interest-free. Southwest Bank of Texas, Wells Fargo and Chase Bank
of Texas will offer financing.
</P>
<P>
   If a PSL holder declines to buy season tickets, that fan will
forfeit their seat license.
</P>
<P>
   PSL applications will be available in Chronicle ads starting
Thursday, at www.2002stadiumfund.com on the Internet and in
brochures at participating banks.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 40 percent of the tickets will be sold in the
upper decks on a season or individual game basis. In addition, the
stadium will have pockets of seats below $20 each and an
alcohol-free zone for families.
</P>
<P>
   The Harris County-Houston Sports Authority will chip in at least
$195 million of the stadium's cost through taxes on rental cars and
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, McNair will pay about $4 million and the Houston
Livestock Show and Rodeo $1.5 million in lease and maintenance
payments annually.
</P>
<P>
   The sports authority will collect the revenues from the PSLs to
avoid tax liabilities. If the PSLs are privately issued, the issuer
has to pay income tax on them.
</P>
<P>
   Under McNair's October 1998 letter of agreement with the county,
sports authority and rodeo to build the stadium, $45 million in PSL
revenues would count against design and construction and $5 million
against the concession build-out.
</P>
<P>
   Additional revenues generated by PSLs would be counted against
additional items the football team desires.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Patterson, vice president of McNair's Houston NFL
Holdings, said the PSLs could raise $70 million, with the net
exceeding $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   The letter of agreement is under reconsideration as the cost
escalates, but McNair has said he will not pay any costs above what
he agreed to in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Authority Finance Chairman Ric Campo said there is
currently no consideration about using excess PSL revenues for the
additional stadium costs.

 &HT;    District attorney in the hot seat amid Lewis trial
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Producers for ``Court TV'' love blockbuster murder
trials. Prosecutors aren't as enamored.
</P>
<P>
   ``A high-profile case is a danger zone,'' said Gwinnett County
District Attorney Danny Porter. ``In any high-profile case, if it's
screwed up you're going to pay the price. And you don't get a lot
of credit if you win.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are expected to win the big trials, he said. ``And
there's something in the back of your mind where you don't want to
make a fool out of yourself in front of a national audience.''
</P>
<P>
   While Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard will probably
not be in the courtroom if Ray Lewis is tried on murder charges,
his name will be all over the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   And on the ballot this year.
</P>
<P>
   Howard, 48, has ratcheted up the stakes by quickly indicting
Lewis and two others in the stabbing deaths of two men after the
Super Bowl and by holding a news conference with Atlanta Mayor Bill
Campbell to announce the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Now, legal experts say, he'd better deliver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the only way Howard wins is if he convicts Lewis,''
said Mark Kadish, a law professor at Georgia State University who
has worked with Howard and Lewis' chief attorney, Ed Garland.
</P>
<P>
   Former Cobb County District Attorney Tom Charron knows the
importance of a big case. A botched murder prosecution led to his
election, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Charron's opponent, District Attorney Buddy Darden, had
convictions on seven defendants thrown out by a federal judge in
the 1971 home invasion murders of Drs. Rosina and Warren Matthews.
Charron used that notorious case as a cudgel to beat the tar out of
Darden's incumbency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason I got to be DA was the Matthews case,'' said
Charron, who now trains prosecutors at the National Advocacy Center
in Columbia. ``No question. That case propelled that election.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other lawyers, Atlanta defense lawyer Mark Spix
wonders why the defendants in the Buckhead case were indicted so
quickly. Defense attorneys can't seek a speedy trial until an
indictment is filed. Once that occurs _ as it did in the Lewis case
_ the meter is running. Meanwhile, police and prosecution
investigators are still running down witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see why I would hurry my investigation,'' said Spix, a
former prosecutor. ``Now they're looking at a trial before June.
Whoops. Hope they're ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has the potential to bring (candidates for Fulton DA) out
of the woodwork,'' he said. ``People smell blood in the water. He's
vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard had appeared to be a shoo-in for re-election. He had
raised more than $65,000 in contributions since 1996 and until last
week had no opposition on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Page Pate, 32, a lawyer with no prosecutorial
experience, announced he will run for DA as a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past week, I've talked to former assistant (DAs),
some judges and defense attorneys,'' Pate said. ``There's a
desperate need for change in that office.''
</P>
<P>
   Pate says Howard's office uses little discretion in deciding
whether to bring charges against a suspect. ``He charges everyone
with everything,'' Pate said.
</P>
<P>
   Qualifying for the office begins in April, with primaries in
July.
</P>
<P>
   With jury selection in the Lewis case set to begin May 12,
voters will most likely know the outcome before the election.
</P>
<P>
   Howard, an accomplished trial lawyer turned administrator, set
his sites on his job long ago, constructing his resume and a strong
political base with aplomb.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Midville, a small town in Middle Georgia, Howard got
degrees from Morehouse College and Emory University law school. He
is married to Petrina Moody and has three children.
</P>
<P>
   He started as an assistant Atlanta solicitor. He then served as
a prosecutor for eight years under longtime Fulton DA Lewis Slaton
and later moved to defense work. His courtroom presence was so
powerful that some Gwinnett County jurors approached him for his
business card after they acquitted his client in a murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Howard was elected Fulton solicitor, but he was just
biding time. In a 1993 interview, longtime Howard friend and
campaign treasurer John Sweet predicted that Howard would one day
be Fulton's top prosecutor. Slaton retired and Howard was elected
in 1996 after a tough campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With a court-imposed gag order in the stabbings case, Howard
declined to be interviewed for this article. But Sweet, in an
interview last week, said, ``This next race is very important to
see if people are satisfied with his incumbency.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweet said an exodus of prosecutors from Howard's office and a
burgeoning caseload are ``growing pains. The fruit of his
innovations will be seen in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard enjoys a wide range of support, with contributions coming
from diverse sources, including Garland, Steve Sadow and Bruce
Harvey _ the high-profile attorneys for the three defendants in the
stabbing case; Mitch Skandalakis, the attack-dog conservative
Republican; and Phillip Morris, the tobacco company, which gave him
$1,000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a sincere interest in getting bad guys off the
street,'' said Skandalakis, who as Fulton Commission chairman was
impressed by Howard's push for additional funding to hire more than
30 new prosecutors. ``There's not anyone out there who can beat
him. There's always some goofball lawyer out there who thinks he
can do better. Ain't gonna happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadow, like several other observers, believes Howard is shooting
for higher office. Sadow said the donations do not affect how
Howard deals with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire his judgment and work ethic,'' Sadow said. ``And if
he hit me up right now, I'd give him more.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadow, who represents Joseph Sweeting in the stabbing case,
won't be very cozy with Howard for the next three months. Last
week, Sadow filed a motion that indicates he is exploring a
self-defense claim. And he joined in on the speedy trial request.
</P>
<P>
   The defense clearly is hoping to catch prosecutors with
incomplete investigations and a hastily prepared strategy. But the
prosecutors think 11 weeks is plenty of time to compile a strong
case.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing the quick indictment was not a bad strategy, says John
Turner, a former Fulton prosecutor who ran against Howard in 1996
and is considering another run this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they were trying to avoid a preliminary hearing where
their case could be screwed up,'' Turner said. In a preliminary
hearing, defense attorneys draw out prosecution evidence and use
the opportunity to cross-examine prosecution witnesses and glean
the DA's strategy. ``You get a version of what they are saying and
you get them boxed in.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Lewis and his co-defendants are scheduled to be tried
together. Legal experts differ on how that will play out, but more
seem to think it helps the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Charron, the former Cobb prosecutor, said trying all three
together could hurt Lewis even if the jury finds that he didn't
stab either man, because ``you can paint all by the same brush.''
The prosecution has portrayed Lewis as a rich athlete who
surrounded himself with ``felons, drug dealers and thugs.'' Lewis'
co-defendants are convicted felons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, you can divide and conquer, put the screws to the
others,'' Charron said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, prosecuting all three men at one time increases
the chances that one will ``flip'' _ accept a deal with the
prosecutor and testify against his co-defendants, Charron said.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Kadish agrees that cutting a deal may be the key for
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're tried together, surely it would be good strategy
for (the DA's office) to make an offer that one of the purported
knifers couldn't resist _ to testify that Lewis was a party to the
crime,'' Kadish said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, lawyers who covet the Fulton DA job will be ``lurking
in the winds hoping (Howard) will lose,'' Kadish said.
</P>
<P>
   They'll be watching. And taking notes.

 &HT;    Peace, love and grunginess
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OCALA NATIONAL FOREST, Fla. _ Jane La Flam is not ready to
accuse anyone of eating her dog.
</P>
<P>
   But someone needs to explain what happened to Beethoven. The
year-old German shepherd disappeared from La Flam's rural Lake
Eaton home when the Rainbow Family started arriving five weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   No, she says flatly, it's not possible the dog ran away.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved it at our house,'' she says. ``And what about the
four other dogs missing from our neighborhood? My 9-year-old still
cries about it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past 13 years, the Rainbow Family has had mid-February
gatherings in this 430,000-acre national forest 65 miles west of
Daytona Beach. Some people who live near the forest describe
Rainbows as peaceful, polite, flower children with a devout respect
for themselves, the earth and other people.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't bother anyone,'' says Barbara Slater, who lives in
Altoona. ``We've even picked a couple of them up in our pickup
truck. They always say `thank you.' If you had a problem on the
road, they'd probably help you.''
</P>
<P>
   And then you hear about dog-eating, shoplifting hippies who
gather in the forest to dance naked, smoke pot, trip on LSD and
have random sex.
</P>
<P>
   Follow the Rainbow People into the forest, and you'll find both
sides of the truth.
</P>
<P>
   COME ON PEOPLE NOW, SMILE ON YOUR BROTHER
</P>
<P>
   Rainbow People. The Rainbow Family. The Rainbow Family of Living
Light. Warriors of the Light.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the name, Rainbows take pride in a sketchy history, no
leaders, no membership numbers and no rules. Their shared
philosophy borrows from Native American folklore, Tibetan Buddhism,
Taoism, Hinduism or any other ``ism'' based on tolerance,
nonviolence, peace and love.
</P>
<P>
   To a Rainbow, the 9-to-5 world is Babylon.
</P>
<P>
   The Rainbow Family, they're fond of saying, is open to everyone
with a belly button. And this family ranges from 2-month-old
infants to aging Baby Boomers. Teen runaways are a chronic problem.
Marion County Sheriff's Lt. Mel Haun found two in the forest. But
many of the Ocala Rainbows were twenty-somethings _ college kids
with expensive, top-of-the-line camping gear _ as well as premature
burnouts and dropouts.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies and U.S. Forest Service workers say what surprises them
most about a Rainbow gathering are the BMWs, Jags and other
expensive cars parked near the camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were at least four lawyers, six registered nurses and
probably two doctors, but they were really quiet,'' says Barry
Sacharow, 44, a member of the governing Rainbow Council and a Fort
Lauderdale paralegal.
</P>
<P>
   The first Rainbow gathering was in 1972 near Strawberry Lake in
Colorado, when counterculture survivors extended an invitation to
Vietnam vets. The Rainbow Gathering theme, then as now, remains
``Welcome Home.'' The Vietnam vets brought survival skills to the
deep-woods party, and the counterculture brought a willingness to
learn and work.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what the two groups established 28 years ago and after
is the basis of gatherings such as the one in Ocala that ended
Sunday. Camps are set up with communal kitchens and a CALM (Center
for Alternative Living Medicine) tent. Single mothers with small
children camp at Kid Village. Rainbow veterans park their campers
at Bus Village. Teens camp at the Ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   Rainbow decisions are made by a fluid, ever-changing council
open to anyone who shows up at the meeting. Those making decisions
are called focalizers because they are willing and able to focus.
</P>
<P>
   There are regional gatherings, such as Ocala, and national and
international ones. The next annual U.S. meeting, expected to draw
more than 30,000, will happen somewhere in Montana, sometime around
July 4. Rainbow scouts have yet to find or announce a site.
</P>
<P>
   Even basic Rainbow information evolves at its own pace. Some
will find out through word of mouth, some on the Internet, some by
phone.
</P>
<P>
   THE CAMP
</P>
<P>
   The Rainbows at Ocala _ more than 2,000, says the group; more
like 1,000, says the U.S. Forest Service _ camped deep in the
forest of weathered cypress and stately pines.
</P>
<P>
   From the nearest dirt roads, it was a 2-mile hike to the camp's
hub, Main Circle, the site of nightly bonfires. You walked through
raw forest and along dry, grassy trails. There were no signs to
guide you.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of every winter meeting is the week leading up to the
Saturday night with a full moon that's closest to Feb. 14. If
there's no full moon, the first Saturday after Valentine's Day will
do.
</P>
<P>
   Some Rainbows, called Road Dogs, begin camping in October for
the February event. They are usually strapped for food, and this is
when the shoplifting and missing dog reports begin.
</P>
<P>
   With a full moon Feb. 19, there was a festive mood approaching
the gathering's big night.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, around noon, campers were crawling out of tents and from
under pieces of plastic and wet sleeping bags under trees. Maybe
there would be coffee or tea at the communal Shanghai Kitchen near
the Heart Fire. Maybe at the Aztec Groves Cafe, there would remain
some of the grapefruits that a skilled Dumpster Diver from Vermont
scored from a Costco trash bin in Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   Much like any city, there were popular stops. Zsu-Zsu's could be
loosely called a bakery with its sugar food, such as cookies and
Kool-Aid, to combat low blood sugar and dehydration. For
entertainment there was The Granola Funk Theater, offering
No-Talent, Talent and Skit nights. Various workshops were impromptu
_ drum tuning, weaving, guitar playing, herb tours or whatever
someone was willing to teach.
</P>
<P>
   At dusk the free kitchens served rice and beans.
</P>
<P>
   And then came the main event at the Main Circle's Heart Fire: a
bonfire built in a pit shaped like a heart.
</P>
<P>
   Campers, many with drums, circled the raging fire, some naked,
some too high to stand and take off their clothes. The party went
on all night, with the drummers and dancers becoming like machines
fueled by pot, hash and LSD. Under the stars and benevolent moon,
there were enough drugs to drum and sing and dance until the sun
rose and muscles finally gave out and, like the rising sun,
exhaustion couldn't be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   But that was night. Daytime was not so dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   When the sun warmed, there was skinny-dipping in any of the
half-dozen ponds and lakes, each home to alligators. Ask a Rainbow
man if that's not dangerous, and he'd tell you Brother Gator knows
Rainbows won't hurt him, ``but we have lost some of our dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from a stand of scrub pines into a clearing was a
scrawny kid dirty as tree bark. A striking woman passed him. She
was in her early 20s, dressed in crisp, clean, flowing Indian
gauze, purple and green. She looked like she could have been headed
to market in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morning, sister,'' the scrawny kid said as she followed the
path he just left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Once in the trees, within seconds she screamed,
``EEEEEE-YEWWW!''
</P>
<P>
   The scrawny kid froze.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry, sister, I forgot to cover it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no restrooms at a Rainbow gathering.
</P>
<P>
   LOSE THE SOAP
</P>
<P>
   If you enter a Rainbow gathering with your pockets full of LSD,
bricks of hash and pot under each arm, and a bar of soap in hand,
you'll be told to lose the soap.
</P>
<P>
   Soap is not allowed. Rainbows say soap can pollute the forest's
rivers, lakes and ground water.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone shows up smelling from shampoo,'' says author and
Rainbow scholar Michael Niman, ``people are going to get all over
their case. It's an environmental thing.'' One benefit, he adds, is
that the smoky grime that covers everyone's skin is a natural bug
repellent.
</P>
<P>
   Arresting a Rainbow is dreaded by Marion County deputies because
of the long drive down U.S. 40 to jail in Ocala. ``They smell so
bad,'' says Lt. Haun, ``you've got to ride with the windows down.''
</P>
<P>
   The smell factor cuts down on more than mosquito bites, says
Niman, an American studies professor at the State University of New
York at Buffalo. He spent 13 years researching the Rainbow movement
for a doctoral thesis that became the 1997 book ``People of the
Rainbow: A Nomadic Utopia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's also why it's not the big orgy that the media makes it
out to be. The bottom line is that people smell bad after a few
days in the woods, and you don't want to get close to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spending a week in the woods is rough on human aesthetics.''
</P>
<P>
   `A' CAMP
</P>
<P>
   Some Rainbow brothers and sisters consider this winter camp the
Rolling Stones-At-Altamonte of gatherings. There are more drugs,
more losers and lunatics than at any other gathering.
</P>
<P>
   When campers start arriving, weeks or months before the actual
event, Haun and other Marion County Sheriff's deputies start
getting calls from grocery stores and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoplifting,'' Haun says, glumly, ``that's constant.''
</P>
<P>
   But it can get worse.
</P>
<P>
   In January, a man calling himself a Rainbow robbed a Winn-Dixie,
at one point holding a hunting knife to the manager's throat. He
was caught in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Haun, a 17-year veteran, has worked the past eight Rainbow
Gatherings from his sheriff's substation at the north end of the
forest. He says the bad guys aren't the real Rainbows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real Rainbows are just the hippie types in old, handmade
clothes,'' he begins. ``They're hard to describe, but they're not
the hard cases.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard cases are at ``A'' Camp.
</P>
<P>
   Rainbows segregate alcohol drinkers. Those people live at A Camp
at the north entrance. It's easily accessible for beer runs _ and
arrests. Every serious offense at the Ocala gathering was at A
Camp. A Rainbow who took a swing at a U.S. Forest Service law
enforcement officer was arrested. Two A Camp men were arrested for
beating each other with a baseball bat.
</P>
<P>
   A Camp is any Rainbow gathering's lunatic fringe. Panhandling at
the entrance. Breaking into cars. Breaking into fights. A-Campers
are known to wash down LSD with beer and liquor.
</P>
<P>
   The A Camp presents a philosophical dilemma for Rainbows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we have no leadership, we can't kick anybody out,''
says Sacharow. ``And you can't really call a Rainbow Gathering
nonviolent if you call the police with guns and clubs and handcuffs
to take away anybody who might be violent. Then you're not
nonviolent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an embarrassing reality that Utopia has a ghetto.''
</P>
<P>
   SO WHAT HAPPENED TO BEETHOVEN?
</P>
<P>
   Rainbow veteran Whistler, 53, says, ``I'm not going to sit here
and tell you a Rainbow never ate a dog.'' But then he added that
it's his experience, going back to the '72 gathering, that missing
local dogs usually go home when the camp breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Eating a dog sounds a bit bizarre and definitely un-Rainbow-like
to Niman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rainbows aren't about covering things up,'' he said. ``If
anyone had an inkling, they'd freak out at the thought that someone
was stealing dogs and eating them. You're dealing with a large
population of vegetarians who are horrified that people eat ham
sandwiches.''
</P>
<P>
   It's even more unlikely, says Niman, that the notorious
A-Campers and Road Dogs would harm a dog. ``These people live on
the road, and being hermits, often, their closest friends are their
dogs.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In the Balkanized Boston of the 1930s
and '40s where Harold L. Vaughan grew up, every working-class kid
had a neighborhood to call his own.
</P>
<P>
   Irish neighborhoods, Jewish neighborhoods, Italian neighborhoods
and other ethnic enclaves all poured their progeny into public
schools that were among the best in the country and where the only
segregation was by gender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys went to school with boys,'' recalls Vaughan, who grew up
in what was then called the colored neighborhood. ``We all got
along. You had friends from all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughan discovered an uglier side of the world in his late teens
when he and his pal, Malcolm Little, quit their shoeshine jobs to
work on the railroad for the summer. Vaughan tried to hail a cab
during an overnight stop in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy at the cab stand told me, `Cabs for your people are
around the corner,''' he says. ``I just looked at him. He said,
`Cabs for colored people.' Then I understood. I was in the South.
But I was also in our nation's capital. That hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   He understood much more after a few trips farther down the line.
He was not accustomed to being called ``Boy,'' and he was not
interested in learning the peculiar regional rules of submissive
behavior _ much less running the risks that came with ignoring
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson I learned was not to get off the train,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   A few summers later, Vaughan was once again on a train heading
south, and this time he had no choice but to get off where he was
told and to follow orders, no matter how degrading.
</P>
<P>
   Like millions of other Americans during World War II, he'd been
drafted into the Army.
</P>
<P>
   But the armed forces that swallowed up Vaughan and nearly a
million other blacks were almost entirely separate from white
units, with little pretense of being equal. Even during the
costliest combat in the Pacific and Europe, nearly all blacks were
held back from the fight. Most were assigned to support roles:
packing supplies, loading ammunition, driving trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughan, who had been working at the Watertown Arsenal before he
was drafted, was sent to the Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Maryland
for training in Army weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   ``That became a horrible experience,'' he says. ``Maryland might
as well have been the Deep South. Colored troops would go into town
and do something that was perfectly normal back home and get
arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughan decided to stay on base until his training was done and
a troop ship carried him to England as a replacement member of the
3077th Ordnance Motor Vehicle Distributing Company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day after we landed, I was on my way to pick up my winter
uniform when I heard someone call, `Hey, Vaughan,''' he recalls.
``I looked over and saw prisoners in blue denim uniforms. I
recognized one of the prisoners as a friend. I went over and asked
what in the world had happened.''
</P>
<P>
   His friend, a black American soldier, had arrived in England
earlier. He quickly discovered that each time a dance was held for
servicemen, the black companies were sent on overnight bivouac.
</P>
<P>
   ``One night, a few of the Boston guys refused to go,'' Vaughan
says. ``They rebelled. Insubordination. They got six months in the
stockade. That's the sort of situation you'd run into.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughan did his best to steer clear of insurrection as well as
indignities. Most black soldiers did the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 80 percent of the troops in my company were Southern,
and they were accustomed to white supervision,'' he says. ``A few
of us Northerners had a problem with it. But when in Rome, you do
as the Romans do _ and you shut your mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughan was assigned to an office job and eventually promoted to
technical sergeant. He remembers frequent lectures from the white
captain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd tell us not to mess up any of the vehicles, because it's
a lot of time and work to get a replacement for a government
vehicle,'' Vaughan says. ``But he told us we could be replaced with
no problem. He'd say, `Go ahead and get yourselves killed. I don't
care.'''
</P>
<P>
   The risks increased as the company crossed the English Channel
after the Allies invaded France in June 1944. Vaughan got to Paris
soon after it was liberated. He was surprised to see black
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``They turned out to be old American soldiers who stayed after
World War I,'' he says. ``They didn't see any point in going back
to Mississippi or Alabama. They found a more comfortable life over
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The 3077th was assigned to deliver tanks and trucks loaded with
guns and ammunition from a depot in Cherbourg, France, to fighting
units that were spreading rapidly toward Germany. As the supply
line known as the Red Ball Express strained to keep up with the
advancing troops, Vaughan was called out from behind his desk and
pressed into service as a driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put me in a big Sherman tank,'' he says. ``It had a
diagram that showed how to start it. All they told me was that it's
simple to drive _ you pull this lever, you steer it like this. It
took off like a shotgun shell.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughan fell into line and followed the other tanks along a dirt
road, but they churned up a dust cloud that was impossible to see
through.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden _ bang, I felt stunned,'' he says. ``There was
a sharp right turn that I didn't see. I went straight through a
brick wall and and down into a drive bed, wedged between two giant
oak trees.''
</P>
<P>
   The concussion knocked him out. Vaughan doesn't know how much
time passed before the other tank drivers realized he was missing
and rescued him. His injuries were serious enough to merit a
partial disability award _ but not until the war was over. Soon
after the crash, he was back behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Supplies were just beginning to catch up with Allied troops when
the Germans came roaring back across the Belgian border in December
1944, setting off the Battle of the Bulge. Scrambling to avoid
becoming trapped, many American units abandoned tanks, arms and
other supplies. The 3077th rushed fresh ordnance to the front.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd load up a truck, hook a cannon on the back and take
off,'' Vaughan says. The snow and ice that made fighting in the
Ardennes Forest difficult made driving nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The dark made things even worse; tape covered all but a thin
slit of each headlight to avoid drawing fire from enemy planes.
There was also no time for rest. Truck drivers got little more
sleep than GIs in foxholes, and even the ever-louder echo of
exploding shells didn't always keep them alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were driving through Belgium, and I'd gone two days without
sleep,'' Vaughan says. ``I fell asleep at the wheel. I drove into a
gully and over a big rock. That jolted me. I automatically hit the
brake. There was a massive tree right in front of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughan and the other drivers finally reached their destination
near Bastogne, Belgium, but they did not see the company of
embattled troops who were to receive their supplies. ``We searched
around and found three infantry guys,'' he says. ``They said they
were the only ones left alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The 3077th dropped off the supplies for the expected replacement
troops but found the return road blocked by fresh fighting. They
meandered along unfamiliar back roads until they came to an
American command post. Their relief quickly turned to anger when
the guard insisted on proof that the black soldiers weren't Germans
in disguise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guard started asking us questions like, `Who's Joe
DiMaggio? Who's Mickey Mouse?''' Vaughan says. ``I asked him: `Have
you ever seen a colored German?' They finally let us pass.''
</P>
<P>
   The 3077th kept up the deliveries throughout the six-week battle
and until the Allied victory in May 1945. Vaughan expected to be
sent to the Pacific, where fighting continued, but instead got a
discharge when his father died. He returned to Boston unsettled by
his experience in the segregated Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``The colored troops had to fight on two fronts _ the enemy and
discrimination,'' he says. ``I was so cynical about the Army and
about the country that I was uncomfortable with how I felt.''
</P>
<P>
   For Vaughan, the antidote to cynicism was politics. Soon after
the war, he started selling real estate and campaigning for
Democrats in local and state elections. He worked hard on John F.
Kennedy's campaigns for Congress, Senate and president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack told me something I never forgot,'' he says. ``He said,
`Your people don't have money, but they can vote. Your vote counts
the same as mine. It's the great equalizer.'''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughan's help in turning out the vote won him friends in high
places. He got a job as aide to Boston Mayor John B. Hynes and was
put in charge of arranging ceremonies for visiting dignitaries. He
got to hobnob with Louis Armstrong, Jimmy Durante, Emperor Haile
Selassie of Ethiopia and Queen Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to become Boston's tax assessor for 30 years. He also
became a lawyer and ran for lieutenant governor of Massachusetts in
1964. ``I lost, but I had a great time,'' he says. Now 75, he is
retired and living with his wife, Josephine, in Palm Beach Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Among his many memorable encounters over the years was a visit
from his old shoeshine pal, Malcolm Little. While Vaughan went off
to the Army, Little went off to prison after becoming a burglar and
petty thief. He was also moved by his experience and turned to
politics of a different sort. He changed his name to Malcolm X.
</P>
<P>
   The Armed Forces were officially desegregated in 1948 by order
of President Harry Truman. No black servicemen were awarded the
Medal of Honor for World War II heroics until 1997, when seven
awards were granted simultaneously. Six were posthumous.
</P>
<P>
   To Vaughan, the contributions of black troops are still largely
unrecognized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did what we were asked to do, even though the treatment was
unbelievable,'' he says. ``Although we were mostly in support
units, the work was essential. The fact remains, they couldn't have
won the war without us.''

 &HT;    Reflections on a war
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ James Gillam didn't choose to be in Vietnam. Sean
Flynn did.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1970, the two young Americans found themselves
in the jungles of the central highlands as U.S. troops launched the
invasion of Cambodia. Gillam, an indifferent student who had lost
his deferment and been drafted, was leading an Army infantry unit.
Flynn, the thrill-seeking son of actor Errol Flynn, was a
free-lance photographer who liked to race ahead of the other
journalists on a red Honda motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was living the swashbuckling roles his father had played in
the movies,'' says Gillam, who got to know Flynn as a drinking
buddy.
</P>
<P>
   Gillam's unit was engaged in a firefight across the Cambodian
border. He heard a motorcycle engine and knew Flynn must be near.
When the shooting stopped, soldiers discovered a riderless cycle
with the motor running. They searched but never found the
photographer.
</P>
<P>
   Now a history professor at Spelman College, Gillam has been
thinking about that firefight again because of an exhibition
opening today at the Atlanta History Center. ``Requiem'' displays
more than 200 pictures taken by the 135 photographers who died or
went missing during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   The renowned Robert Capa was among the first. Life magazine's
Larry Burrows was among the last. Flynn and scores of others died
or vanished in between.
</P>
<P>
   They took some of the most memorable images of the war. A
captured Viet Cong sniper hangs upside down like a trophy marlin. A
helicopter crew chief breaks down crying after a bloody mission. A
medic, his head swaddled in bandages, cradles the head of another
wounded soldier.
</P>
<P>
   It has been almost 25 years since the war ended with the fall of
Saigon in April 1975. To mark the occasion, the History Center
assembled a panel of veterans, refugees, journalists and scholars
to advise it on programs to go along with ``Requiem.''
</P>
<P>
   They see different things in the powerful images by the dead and
missing photographers. They would. There were many viewpoints, many
experiences, many private wars in Vietnam. Here are a few of them.
</P>
<P>
   THE GOOD SOLDIER
</P>
<P>
   If Bill Poole has mixed emotions about ``Requiem,'' perhaps it's
because he has such definite opinions about the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of what I did in Vietnam,'' says the 55-year-old
lawyer, a member of the Atlanta Vietnam Veterans Business
Association. ``I think we were right to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Poole grew up in Lithonia and went to the U.S. Military Academy
on a football and scholastic appointment. After he graduated, the
Army taught him Vietnamese and shipped him to the Mekong Delta in
1968 as a district adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived with those people. Ate with them. Spoke their
language. When I entered the district, it had been overrun by the
Viet Cong. We reopened roads and canals. We helped conduct village
elections. That's a side of the war you don't usually see.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't see much of it in ``Requiem.'' The show reflects the
media's understandable focus on the progress of the war. It dwells
on the guts and grit of combat, not the intangible battles for the
hearts and minds of the Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   Poole certainly experienced the former; he saw a U.S. soldier
blown apart by a 3-year-old child booby-trapped with a bomb. But he
prefers to remember other aspects of the war; his Atlanta office
has a photo of a grateful Vietnamese woman on the day the Americans
reopened her village market.
</P>
<P>
   When Poole was sent back to the States in 1969, his superiors
warned him not to wear his uniform in airports. America was turning
against the war; the military was plummeting in popularity. He
enrolled at the University of Georgia law school and sought the
counsel of its best-known professor, Dean Rusk, the former
secretary of state who had been a key figure in formulating U.S.
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still agree with him,'' Poole says. ``If we hadn't stood up
to the Communists in Vietnam, all Southeast Asia would have gone
Communist. I've thought about it a lot. It seems like half my
football team at the academy got killed over there. I still think
it was worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Poole admires the pictures in ``Requiem'' and respects the
courage of the people who took them. But if he had his way,
photojournalists would never again get that close to U.S. troops in
combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole time I was in Vietnam,'' he says, ``my wife tried to
avoid the TV news because she was afraid she'd see her husband get
killed. It's probably good to restrict media access during war.
Most Americans aren't ready to see that sort of thing. If we hadn't
had some of the coverage in Vietnam, maybe we would have been
allowed to fight the war and win it.''
</P>
<P>
   THE NATIVE DAUGHTER
</P>
<P>
   Yung Krall finds it difficult to look at the photos in
``Requiem.'' That's her country being destroyed, her people being
killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``So painful,'' she says. ``So sad.''
</P>
<P>
   One of at least 20,000 Vietnamese in metro Atlanta, the
54-year-old Krall counsels immigrants as director of multinational
relations at Emory Northlake Regional Medical Center. When she
talks with refugees from Kosovo or some other war zone, she
understands what they're going through personally.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnam War split Krall's family. Her father, a member of
the Communist Politburo, abandoned his wife and children in the
Mekong Delta. They opposed communism and moved frequently, changing
their names to avoid reprisals. She left the country in 1968,
marrying a U.S. Navy pilot and moving to America. Her 1995 memoir,
``A Thousand Tears Falling,'' is banned in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Requiem'' was first shown in 1997 at the Newseum in
Arlington, Va., some Vietnamese protested because they considered
it soft on communism. Krall warned the History Center that the same
thing might happen here.
</P>
<P>
   But she has another, contradictory reaction to the pictures:
pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go around the country talking to groups, people think
the South Vietnamese did not fight. I'm grateful the U.S. fought
for our freedom. But we had been fighting for it all our lives. You
couldn't be a draft dodger in Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   Krall lost four relatives in the fighting, on both sides. If she
were putting together a ``Requiem'' for them, the photos would show
the impact of the fighting on Vietnamese civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see people fleeing from a burning village. The VC have
mortared the elementary school with artillery they've bought from
Americans on the black market. Women and children are dead. They're
buried in a mass grave.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she hasn't been back since the North Vietnamese took
Saigon and renamed it Ho Chi Minh City, the country hasn't loosened
its grip on her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to people about Vietnam twice a week, and I always tear
up,'' she says. ``Gosh, yes, I still love it. I love America, too,
because it adopted me. But Vietnam is blood.''
</P>
<P>
   THE STUDENT AND TEACHER
</P>
<P>
   At 51, Marc Gilbert has been teaching and writing about Vietnam
for 19 years as a history professor at North Georgia College and
State University in Dahlonega. He's researching a book on the war
and the American South, a subject he'll talk about during a panel
discussion March 25 at the History Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnam War had a distinctly Southern flavor. Many of the
men who prosecuted it were Southerners _ President Lyndon B.
Johnson (Texas), Secretary of State Rusk (Georgia), General William
Westmoreland (South Carolina). With its long fighting tradition and
profusion of military bases, the South ranked as the most hawkish
region of the country in public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even here, there was an anti-war movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It paralleled the rest of the nation, running slightly
behind,'' Gilbert says. ``The biggest difference is that is wasn't
fashionable to speak out here like it was elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   It definitely wasn't fashionable at Gilbert's school. ``This is
a military college,'' he says. ``They had a streaker, but I don't
think they had an anti-war protest.''
</P>
<P>
   The politics of peace was complicated in the South by the civil
rights movement. Anti-war activists were assumed to be pro-civil
rights, Gilbert says, and that made them doubly subversive in the
eyes of the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most famous photos in ``Requiem'' mutely addresses
the intertwining of the two great issues of the '60s. Taken by
Larry Burrows, the image ran across two pages of Life magazine in
1966, at a time when the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was taking the
civil rights movement north. It shows a wounded black Marine
staggering toward a mud-caked white Marine in a first-aid camp.
Green fatigues, brown mud, crimson blood _ these colors, the photo
testifies, are the only ones that matter in battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``A picture like that,'' Gilbert says, ``is worth more than a
thousand words.''
</P>
<P>
   THE OTHER SHOOTERS
</P>
<P>
   Lon Holmberg was a photographer in Vietnam, but you won't see
any work from his colleagues in ``Requiem.'' They toted cameras for
the U.S. Army. For the most part, the exhibition includes only
photographers who worked for accredited media.
</P>
<P>
   Now a documentary filmmaker in Orange, Va., the 55-year-old
Holmberg will be part of a panel discussion on Vietnam reporting
today at the History Center. He was curious how many military
photographers died during the war, so he asked the National
Archives to research the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said there were 17 through 1970,'' Holmberg says.``I
imagine there were more. I want to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   Military photographers had the full range of Vietnam
experiences, from combat to shooting grip-and-grin's for the Army
press and small-town papers back home. Holmberg volunteered to go
out with the troops and arrived in the field just as the invasion
of Laos was beginning in 1971. After four months, he gladly
retreated to Saigon to take pictures for Gen. Creighton Abrams, the
U.S. commander.
</P>
<P>
   That's where he came closest to getting shot _ by friendly fire,
no less.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Henry Kissinger flew in to meet with Abrams.
Their motorcade was getting ready to pull out when Holmberg
realized he didn't have a seat. An admiral said he could ride with
him, and he ducked into the car, almost lethally surprising a
Secret Service agent in the front.
</P>
<P>
   ``He spun around and pointed a nickel-plated revolver at me and
said, `I should have shot you.''' Holmberg laughs. ``Probably too
much coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   THE RELUCTANT WARRIOR
</P>
<P>
   James Gillam teaches a seminar on Vietnam at Spelman College. A
few years ago, a student interrupted him: ``Can we stop this? My
father died there. I never met him. This is all a bit heavy for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillam, a 53-year-old father of three, knows how she felt.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam was particularly vexing for a young black man in the
'60s. A disproportionate number of the early casualties were
suffered by working-class minorities. When Gillam took charge of
his infantry unit in 1969, more than 40 percent of the men were
black or Latino.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland native was already opposed to the war. His opinion
started to turn when he saw how his brother, a Marine, was treated
in Vietnam. His platoon left him for dead in the field, sick with
malaria and dysentery; an Army unit found him walking around in
delirium.
</P>
<P>
   As if that weren't enough, Gillam had a scrape with bigotry
after he was drafted and sent south for training. He got in a fight
when a bar near his base refused to serve him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to die for American foreign policy, and they
wouldn't even serve me a drink in Leesville, La.?'' he says. ``It
made me think.''
</P>
<P>
   The fighting in Vietnam proved every bit as nasty as Gillam had
heard it would be. He caught a bullet in the knee, shrapnel in the
chest and forehead, and was briefly taken prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was body count,'' he says. ``You'd stay in the
jungle until you got your quota. There'd be arguments over parts.
Can you count a single leg as a kill? Does that puddle of blood
count?''
</P>
<P>
   After he was discharged, Gillam joined the Vietnam Veterans
Against the War and was arrested at a demonstration. He also ran a
veterans rehabilitation program and went back to college with an
emphasis in Asian history. He's taught at Spelman since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Gillam has always wondered what happened to Sean Flynn, the
dashing young photographer he met in the jungle almost 30 years
ago. He feared the worst; neither Flynn nor his corpse ever
appeared. But no one knew for sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Requiem'' has answered the question. The exhibition grew out
of an effort to discover the fate of Flynn and another
motorcycle-riding photographer who vanished with him that day, Dana
Stone.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Page, a fellow photographer who had been wounded in Vietnam,
went back 10 years ago to investigate the journalist MIAs. Based on
government intelligence and interviews with villagers, he concluded
that guerrillas had held the two captive for 13 months before
finally executing them. Locals identified them from pictures. One
old man offered three teeth that he said came from the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Gillam hadn't heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did kill him?'' he says. ``Well, damn.''

 &HT;    EarthLink president vows to remain close to workers
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ EarthLink President Michael McQuary sees himself as a
behind the scenes executive making sure the company runs smoothly
and employees are happy.
</P>
<P>
   McQuary, or ``McQ'' as he's known to his friends and associates,
was happy to keep the company on track as president and chief
operating officer of MindSpring, while Charles Brewer, the
company's charismatic founder, hit the media circuit. Now McQuary
is EarthLink's standard bearer for core values and beliefs that
were MindSpring's foundation. It's a role he is passionate about
and takes very seriously. At the company's Atlanta headquarters, he
talked about his ideals and aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where do you fall in the new organizational structure of the
new company?
</P>
<P>
   A: I report to Garry Betty, EarthLink's chief executive officer.
I have the business units and operations of the company reporting
to me. Garry used to have to be back in Pasadena (Calif., where
EarthLink was based before the merger) minding the store. Now he's
able to go out looking for the next big deal to take us to the next
level. This allows us to split some responsibilities and not worry
that things are a shambles back home.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does it bother you that you don't have the same job you had
prior to the merger?
</P>
<P>
   A: Once you get over the ego impact of not running everything,
it takes a lot of pressure off. I can focus on things. In the past,
I reported to Charles and everyone else reported to me and that was
pretty stressful. What I can do now is focus and make sure the
company's energy and Garry's energy is communicated to everyone in
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've got big responsibilities, but you also place a big
emphasis on your employees.
</P>
<P>
   A: I have to make sure I have a calming effect. I've had this
adage that the higher up you are the more of an impact you have on
the people down below. If the CEO sneezes, the top executives get a
cold. If the top executives get a cold, the middle managers get
pneumonia and if the middle managers get pneumonia, some of the
people on the front line are going to die.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So how do you keep the folks on the front line from dying?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's important for me to be accessible. I'm a lot more
accessible than Charles or Garry.
</P>
<P>
   I spend a lot of time walking around the company just seeing
what's going on. People feel they can approach me, and that's the
most important thing. People all around the company just look at
me, and they say ``There goes McQ.'' There was an employee I helped
find a new job at our Seattle offices and before he left, he
brought his replacement by to my cubicle _ I don't have an office _
and he said, ``Here's McQ _ I don't really know what he does but if
you need anything, he's the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: It's a very personal approach.
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, it's business, but it's personal, too. You can't keep
your personal life out of the office. There is still a mystique
about working here. The tactics of fear and intimidation have no
place here. The people who work here know they are valued and their
ideas are valued. Your work environment does make a big difference.
Way before Charles started MindSpring, he had this job he just
hated. He'd come home every day just grinding his teeth. Grinding
your teeth about your job is no way to live.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A lot of people, particularly investors and Wall Street
analysts, were disturbed by MindSpring's and EarthLink's decision
to give up being profitable in order to grow the company. Was that
a tough decision to make?
</P>
<P>
   A: We know how to be profitable and we can get there again in a
quarter if we needed to. But I never wanted us to be a nice little
profitable Internet company. We wanted to be a large company that
can make a difference in the way the world does business. There are
an awful lot of people rooting for us to win, but there are a lot
of cynics looking for us to lose the way. But I'm still president
of the company and we still know what's important.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you really think a list of core values and beliefs can
make that big a difference?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, I do. People say you can't be as big as AT&AMP;T or IBM and
still cling to those value systems. People think there is a
tradeoff, you can't have huge profits and a great work environment.
</P>
<P>
   Our ultimate goal is to change the way the world does business.
It would be so easy to turn our back on the value system or lower
our service standards, but we can only accomplish our goals of
being wildly profitable, having lots of customers and happy
employees if we cling to those beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There have been rumors that you are considering leaving
EarthLink, but it sounds like you plan to be around for a while.
</P>
<P>
   A: I've still got several things I need to accomplish.
Eventually the company will be more valuable than it has ever been
before. I'm in an important role where I can contribute to the good
of the company. I won't leave until I've accomplished my personal
goals. And I probably won't do anything after I leave here. There's
a lot to be said for going out on top and that's what I'd like to
do. Another five years feels about right. This type of work can be
all-consuming.

 &HT;    Toyota touting its sporty MR2 Spyder to online crowd
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Toyota is joining the roadster revolution in bringing
back the MR2, a limited-production sports car that developed an
almost cultlike following. The new MR2 Spyder is Toyota's first
convertible-only vehicle, but one backed with 15 years of history.
</P>
<P>
   The fanfare that is accompanying the introduction is edgy, meant
to appeal to young and hip buyers who are skilled Internet users.
Instead of the customary media hype in print, television and radio,
Toyota is going online. The campaign, in fact, is similar to the
evolution of the MR2.
</P>
<P>
   The new MR2 Spyder, with only 5,000 units expected annually,
looks similar to the Porsche Boxster. It will face competition in a
segment that is seeing new entries almost every year. Starting with
the Mazda Miata, the roadster niche has filled quickly with entries
from BMW, DaimlerChrysler and Honda, with Ford and General Motors
soon to follow.
</P>
<P>
   The new MR2 is a departure from the larger, heavier 1991-95
series that shared many components with the Celica. The new MR2
returns more to its roots. The original cars offered from 1984 to
'90 were lighter and based on the Corolla.
</P>
<P>
   While the early MR2 produced a following among enthusiasts,
there were problems. It wasn't the cars themselves, but the way
people drove them. Always with a mid-engine configuration, the
early MR2s handled so well that less-skilled drivers frequently
would get in over their heads and lose control of the vehicle. That
led to the heavier, more stable second generation.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent similar problems in the new MR2, Toyota has stretched
the wheelbase and engineered in an inherent understeer
characteristic. It's due in showrooms this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Back to that cult following.
</P>
<P>
   The more than 40,000 owners of previous MR2s and more than 100
Web sites dedicated to the marque had an effect on Toyota's MR2
marketing strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the Echo and Celica as the third member of Toyota's
``genesis plan'' for the youth market, the MR2 ad campaign began
with pre-launch commercials on the Internet, followed with
product-specific ads in publications such as Premiere and Wired.
Perhaps the more novel angles are a relationship marketing program
designed to hold the interest of customers on the
``waiting-to-purchase'' list and the concept that the message and
media will be crafted to appeal to consumers willing to work hard
to keep up with new trends.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are directed to www.isthistoyota.com, a
video-enhanced, nearly text-free site. Toyota claims to have
designed the site to encourage repeat visits.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a mid-engine, reasonably priced convertible sports
car is appealing. The idea of being pleased to ``wait to purchase''
_ that could be another story. But it's been some time since I fell
into the category that Toyota is targeting for the MR2.

 &HT;    Land Rover Discovery ready for civilization
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For anyone who's about to venture into real unpaved
territory and wants a vehicle that's thoroughly tough, determined
and not likely to remind you constantly of the family sedan,
there's nothing quite like the Land Rover Discovery II.
</P>
<P>
   While not the ultimate Rover, the Discovery is just fine for
tooling around the American outback, suburbs and city. It's
base-priced at $34,150 but can be had with enough options to push
the total to the test vehicle's $43,875. Bigger and stronger Range
Rovers go for $59,000 and $67,300 and are suitable for just about
anywhere on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Land/Range Rover name conjures images from old Field
and Stream stories of hardy outdoorsmen and brutally
rough-and-ready vehicles, look elsewhere. Today's Discovery is
quite civilized despite having a trucklike ride, a tall body that
makes entry and exit a bit strenuous and driving characteristics
far removed from the image of vehicles marketed by parent company
BMW.
</P>
<P>
   To many, Range/Land Rover is the benchmark of sport-utilities,
and it's a well-earned tag. After a near-total overhaul last year,
the Discovery emerged longer (185.2 inches), wider (74.4 inches)
and roomier (seating for five or seven with a maximum 63.3 cubic
feet of cargo room).
</P>
<P>
   It's not losing ground in the race for the upper end of the
mainstream market. Nor is the Discovery falling behind in off-road
capability. It catches flak in the power department because its
4.0-liter V-8 makes but 188 horsepower. But it makes 250
pounds-feet of torque at 2,600 engine rpm, and that's enough to
climb seriously rugged terrain. The getting-down process is
smoothed by Discovery's hill descent control, which uses the brakes
to help slow the 4,500-pound Discovery when it's in low range.
</P>
<P>
   While that feature may not mean much to owners in everyday use,
Discovery's optional cornering enhancement package ($2,900) is
easily appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   It allays fears of the tall (76.4 inches) vehicle rolling and
pitching in turns and keeps it on a near-level keel.
</P>
<P>
   The interior, too, is modernized with self-dimming lighting,
drink holders and comfortable seats. Front and side visibility is
great because of seat height and wraparound glass, but rear
visibility is poor because of the rear-mounted spare tire and when
there's a middle passenger in the third seat (the headrest also can
be a problem).
</P>
<P>
   The nicely packaged instrumentation is quickly read, and
controls are sensibly arrayed, although familiarity is vital and
the ignition switch is awkwardly positioned on the steering column.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel mileage, as might be expected of the V-8 powerplant, is a
weak point, with premium gasoline recommended. The EPA figures of
13 and 17 mpg city and highway, respectively, are difficult to
match.
</P>
<P>
   The mud-and-show radials that are standard on Discovery are fine
for those situations, but are noisy and send vibration into the
cabin at speed on paved surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe that's Discovery's way of reminding that its heritage
and capabilities are not predicated on having optimal driving
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 2000 Land Rover Discovery II four-wheel-drive
sport utility vehicle
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $43,875 (base: $34,150, plus $625 delivery fee)
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 4.0-liter V-8 engine (188 horsepower), four-speed
automatic transmission with sport mode and two-speed transfer
gearbox
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual front and seat-mounted side air bags,
front and rear door impact beams, power anti-lock disc brakes,
traction control, optional active cornering enhancement system
($2,900, includes 18-inch alloy wheels, speed-rated radial tires)
</P>
<P>
   Other options on test vehicle: package with dual power sunroofs,
third-row seats, rear-step, self-leveling suspension, rear audio
controls, $3,250; heated seats and windshield, $500
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 13 mpg premium unleaded city, 17 mpg highway

 &HT;    Continuing education a priceless tool
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Contrary to the opinion of my teen-age son, I believe
that when one has learned all there is to know, it's time to meet
your maker.
</P>
<P>
   I am continually humbled by life's daily lessons. Although I
bear the credentials of a journeyman/master mechanic with almost 30
years in the automotive profession, my quest for knowledge must
equal or exceed my students'.
</P>
<P>
   I preach and practice the value of continuing automotive
education and training. My personal update training commitment
often exceeds 100 hours a year in manufacturers' and aftermarket
classes. The investment proves its worth when the knowledge I
gained guides me through a repair I would have been unable to
perform without it.
</P>
<P>
   I can teach tomorrow's mechanics what is coming, not just what
has been. I also tell them that for every dollar they spend on
tools, they must put aside another dollar for training. It isn't
cheap, but it's priceless. A $30,000 tool inventory locked up in a
shiny red box may look impressive, but it doesn't mean you can fix
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Too many people in the profession have an aversion to continuing
their educations and honing their skills. I've heard all of the
excuses: ``It's too expensive'' or ``I'm too tired after work'' or
``I don't need to know that stuff anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Year after year, I continue to see the same faces in most of the
classes I attend. About 20 percent of the mechanics out there are
pursuing the skills they need, but 80 percent are muddling through
and changing parts. This certainly is among the reasons why the
public perceives mechanics poorly and why we have so many consumer
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   When you take your car in for repairs, ask to see the
credentials of the person who will be working on it. These include
ASE certifications and documentation of continued training. Don't
settle for ``Don't worry, our guys are experts.''
</P>
<P>
   Training costs the mechanic and the shop both time and money.
Typically, the cost of a two-night class is $160 to $190.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers can sign their people up for manufacturers' training but
must pay the mechanic for the time he is in school while losing the
revenue he would have made at the shop. This additional cost of
doing business right is passed on to the consumer, usually
reflected in the shop's labor rate.
</P>
<P>
   It may not appear to be a bargain coming in the door, but it
could be the best bargain you've ever driven.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of bargains, this is for mechanics and motorists who
want to improve the quality of the repairs they are receiving. I
have a ``no excuses'' deal for you.
</P>
<P>
   The Automotive Service Association of Georgia (www.asashop.org)
is hosting its third annual 2EXCEL high-tech training and expo on
March 4. This event is open to professionals and is part of the
ASA's commitment to continuing education and service excellence.
</P>
<P>
   The seminars offer a plethora of subjects ranging from collision
and paint for body shops to solid-state and lab scope diagnostics
to automotive management training. The classes will be conducted by
some of the industry's most distinguished instructors.
</P>
<P>
   I have attended the 2EXCEL training classes for the past two
years, always leaving with my brain and my stomach stuffed.
Besides, it's the social event of the mechanics' season. For
information on 2EXCEL, call Jonelle Cellucci at ASA of Georgia,
(770) 455-9326.

 &HT;    Challenge: To see young dads in added dimensions
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Talk about a tough sell. Michael Hayes is vending
Slushies in an ice storm. Before an audience mostly of females,
many who work with teen moms every day, he asks them to see the
young dad's side of things.
</P>
<P>
   The seminar is ``The Father Factor: Understanding the
Significance of Male Involvement in Teen Pregnancy.'' Hey, we know
the male significance. It's like that calculus song on MTV:
</P>
<P>
   ``You plus me equals us.''
</P>
<P>
   And baby makes three? Figure again, Babe, because I'm
subtracting me.
</P>
<P>
   Tough sell. As director of the Austin-based Texas Fragile
Families Initiative, Hayes rises to the challenge often, as he did
here recently at a seminar sponsored by Planned Parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes said that when society dismisses the male's role in teen
parenting, it can make a bad situation worse. First, having an
adversarial relationship makes it tougher to get dads to follow
through on child support. Second, a nonwarring relationship and a
partnership can make life better for a child.
</P>
<P>
   Fragile families, as defined by a Ford Foundation initiative,
are young, never-married parents and their children. Tellingly,
rather than advocacy for either gender, the initiative is
``child-centered.''
</P>
<P>
   If arithmetic is of the essence, Hayes says it's compelling.
Among young dads who have no contact with their children, less than
a third pay child support. And that includes some fathers who want
contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they feel they're being pushed out of the picture, why
keep trying?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes has no illusions that the average pairing in tender years
is going to result in marriage. Indeed, he assumes mother and
father will live and grow apart. He discourages the term
``co-parenting.'' After all, a child can only live in one house.
What he encourages is ``team parenting'' _ meaning that though
there's a starting squad, a mom and most likely her parents,
there's someone in reserve, a biological dad, ready and willing to
handle the ball, baby-sit, almost serve as a business partner.
</P>
<P>
   Contact is key, said Hayes. Contact equals support, or at least
that's the idea. Something about those peepers, that baby talk,
will make a dad want to act like a dad in ways he can.
</P>
<P>
   In the audience were representatives of the Texas attorney
general's office, trying to get some tips on how to bring young
fathers into the fold without ropes, chains or subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   Also on-hand as part of a panel were three young fathers from
San Angelo. Its Healthy Families Program is a model from which 13
similar efforts are to start this summer, including one in Waco to
be administered by Camp Fire.
</P>
<P>
   Some people will point out that the concept ``healthy family''
is already breached and broken when a teen bears a child. Healthy
Families seeks only to make the best out of a bad, but too common,
situation.
</P>
<P>
   To get the seminar participants past the stick figures in their
heads, Hayes handed out markers to small groups. Draw a father.
Give him the features he needs.
</P>
<P>
   A cumulative portrait was far more than skull and bones. You had
big ears, for listening. You had big feet, for stability. The
cumulative dad had eyes to be observant, long arms for sharing, a
shoulder for leaning. He had a smile for sharing a sense of joy,
and a heart that leaped off the page.
</P>
<P>
   This cumulative father was no Fabio. But he was no
one-dimensional cut-out. Hayes' point is is that if we want young
fathers' help, we'd better see them in more than 1-D.
</P>
<P>
   We are all aware of the fact that too many males, though they
supply the plumbing and the DNA, are miserable at fathering. The
point of Hayes' sales job is that when it comes to potential _
eyes, ears, feet, arms and heart _ every father is anatomically
correct.

   ATLANTA _ For anyone who's about to venture into real unpaved
territory and wants a vehicle that's thoroughly tough, determined
and not likely to remind you constantly of the family sedan,
there's nothing quite like the Land Rover Discovery II.
</P>
<P>
   While not the ultimate Rover, the Discovery is just fine for
tooling around the American outback, suburbs and city. It's
base-priced at $34,150 but can be had with enough options to push
the total to the test vehicle's $43,875. Bigger and stronger Range
Rovers go for $59,000 and $67,300 and are suitable for just about
anywhere on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Land/Range Rover name conjures images from old Field
and Stream stories of hardy outdoorsmen and brutally
rough-and-ready vehicles, look elsewhere. Today's Discovery is
quite civilized despite having a trucklike ride, a tall body that
makes entry and exit a bit strenuous and driving characteristics
far removed from the image of vehicles marketed by parent company
BMW.
</P>
<P>
   To many, Range/Land Rover is the benchmark of sport-utilities,
and it's a well-earned tag. After a near-total overhaul last year,
the Discovery emerged longer (185.2 inches), wider (74.4 inches)
and roomier (seating for five or seven with a maximum 63.3 cubic
feet of cargo room).
</P>
<P>
   It's not losing ground in the race for the upper end of the
mainstream market. Nor is the Discovery falling behind in off-road
capability. It catches flak in the power department because its
4.0-liter V-8 makes but 188 horsepower. But it makes 250
pounds-feet of torque at 2,600 engine rpm, and that's enough to
climb seriously rugged terrain. The getting-down process is
smoothed by Discovery's hill descent control, which uses the brakes
to help slow the 4,500-pound Discovery when it's in low range.
</P>
<P>
   While that feature may not mean much to owners in everyday use,
Discovery's optional cornering enhancement package ($2,900) is
easily appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   It allays fears of the tall (76.4 inches) vehicle rolling and
pitching in turns and keeps it on a near-level keel.
</P>
<P>
   The interior, too, is modernized with self-dimming lighting,
drink holders and comfortable seats. Front and side visibility is
great because of seat height and wraparound glass, but rear
visibility is poor because of the rear-mounted spare tire and when
there's a middle passenger in the third seat (the headrest also can
be a problem).
</P>
<P>
   The nicely packaged instrumentation is quickly read, and
controls are sensibly arrayed, although familiarity is vital and
the ignition switch is awkwardly positioned on the steering column.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel mileage, as might be expected of the V-8 powerplant, is a
weak point, with premium gasoline recommended. The EPA figures of
13 and 17 mpg city and highway, respectively, are difficult to
match.
</P>
<P>
   The mud-and-show radials that are standard on Discovery are fine
for those situations, but are noisy and send vibration into the
cabin at speed on paved surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe that's Discovery's way of reminding that its heritage
and capabilities are not predicated on having optimal driving
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 2000 Land Rover Discovery II four-wheel-drive
sport utility vehicle
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $43,875 (base: $34,150, plus $625 delivery fee)
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 4.0-liter V-8 engine (188 horsepower), four-speed
automatic transmission with sport mode and two-speed transfer
gearbox
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual front and seat-mounted side air bags,
front and rear door impact beams, power anti-lock disc brakes,
traction control, optional active cornering enhancement system
($2,900, includes 18-inch alloy wheels, speed-rated radial tires)
</P>
<P>
   Other options on test vehicle: package with dual power sunroofs,
third-row seats, rear-step, self-leveling suspension, rear audio
controls, $3,250; heated seats and windshield, $500
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 13 mpg premium unleaded city, 17 mpg highway

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Few sights are sadder than that of new love,
just lit, guttering out before its flame can come to full glow.
Yet, alas, there's no getting around it: annulment seems the
certain future for Rick Rockwell and Darva Conger. Cupid, come next

   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ when society dismisses the male's

   ATLANTA _ Contrary to the opinion of my teen-age son, I believe
that when one has learned all there is to know, it's time to meet
your maker.
</P>
<P>
   I am continually humbled by life's daily lessons. Although I
bear the credentials of a journeyman/master mechanic with almost 30
years in the automotive profession, my quest for knowledge must
equal or exceed my students'.
</P>
<P>
   I preach and practice the value of continuing automotive
education and training. My personal update training commitment
often exceeds 100 hours a year in manufacturers' and aftermarket
classes. The investment proves its worth when the knowledge I
gained guides me through a repair I would have been unable to
perform without it.
</P>
<P>
   I can teach tomorrow's mechanics what is coming, not just what
has been. I also tell them that for every dollar they spend on
tools, they must put aside another dollar for training. It isn't
cheap, but it's priceless. A $30,000 tool inventory locked up in a
shiny red box may look impressive, but it doesn't mean you can fix
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Too many people in the profession have an aversion to continuing
their educations and honing their skills. I've heard all of the
excuses: ``It's too expensive'' or ``I'm too tired after work'' or
``I don't need to know that stuff anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Year after year, I continue to see the same faces in most of the
classes I attend. About 20 percent of the mechanics out there are
pursuing the skills they need, but 80 percent are muddling through
and changing parts. This certainly is among the reasons why the
public perceives mechanics poorly and why we have so many consumer
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   When you take your car in for repairs, ask to see the
credentials of the person who will be working on it. These include
ASE certifications and documentation of continued training. Don't
settle for ``Don't worry, our guys are experts.''
</P>
<P>
   Training costs the mechanic and the shop both time and money.
Typically, the cost of a two-night class is $160 to $190.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers can sign their people up for manufacturers' training but
must pay the mechanic for the time he is in school while losing the
revenue he would have made at the shop. This additional cost of
doing business right is passed on to the consumer, usually
reflected in the shop's labor rate.
</P>
<P>
   It may not appear to be a bargain coming in the door, but it
could be the best bargain you've ever driven.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of bargains, this is for mechanics and motorists who
want to improve the quality of the repairs they are receiving. I
have a ``no excuses'' deal for you.
</P>
<P>
   The Automotive Service Association of Georgia (www.asashop.org)
is hosting its third annual 2EXCEL high-tech training and expo on
March 4. This event is open to professionals and is part of the
ASA's commitment to continuing education and service excellence.
</P>
<P>
   The seminars offer a plethora of subjects ranging from collision
and paint for body shops to solid-state and lab scope diagnostics
to automotive management training. The classes will be conducted by
some of the industry's most distinguished instructors.
</P>
<P>
   I have attended the 2EXCEL training classes for the past two
years, always leaving with my brain and my stomach stuffed.
Besides, it's the social event of the mechanics' season. For
information on 2EXCEL, call Jonelle Cellucci at ASA of Georgia,
(770) 455-9326.

   CHINA-CALIF (San Francisco) _ China's increasingly tense

   SLEEP-APNEA (Troy, N.Y.) _ Michael I. Savic, a sound specialist
and engineering professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, is
working to perfect a computer program that can detect potentially
fatal episodes of sleep apnea. This would offer physicians an
easier and cheaper way to diagnose their patients. By SYLVIA WOOD.

   NAIL-DISEASE (Albany, N.Y.) _ Nail infections affect up to 5
percent of Americans, causing nails to become brittle, dry,
discolored. In some cases, the infections are so severe that they
can cause pain with walking or grasping objects. Recently, the
government approved a nail polish, the first ever, to treat
hard-to-heal fungus infections and is expect to be on pharmacy

of suburbia in the midst of this ever-so-hip, cosmopolitan city.
San Francisco, the home of restaurants founded by Jeremiah Tower

   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ I don't know what the California
version is of the Congressional Medal of Honor, but I think State
Sen. Debra Bowen ought to get one. A Democrat, Bowen has finally
done something so sensible _ and overdue _ it's hard to believe it
came from a politician. She introduced a bill that would require
the California Public Utilities Commission to assign new telephone
area codes on the basis of technology, not geography. By STEPHANIE

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Today is also the 105th anniversary of the birth of U.S. Army
Gen. Matthew Ridgeway, who led the 82nd Airborne Division in World
War II. For what was Ridgeway famous during the Korean War? &QL;

</P>
<P>
   This week's featured wine is worth a long-distance call or two,
because it's both tasty, different and imminently affordable. The
 &UR; 1998 Abbaye de Valmagne Blanc  &LR; _ 4 stars _ is a blend of unusual
grapes that works out very well as a seafood wine. This dear Abbaye
is brisk, crisp, with a bit of mineraly-earthy quality, and it's
from one of France's oldest vineyards, dating back to 1138.
</P>
<P>
   The $10.99 won't outrank your budget, either. &QL;

FEDERAL JUDGE ILLEGALLY GAGS ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Information received from a Freedom of Information Act request
is presumed to be in the public domain _ or the federal government
would not have released it. That's basic law. But a judge in New
Mexico inexplicably sees it differently. He has stopped an
environmental group from sharing information with the public that
it gained from an FOIA request.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1998, Forest Guardians, an environmental group based in
Santa Fe, N.M., filed an FOIA request with the U.S. Forest Service
seeking information regarding banks that hold grazing permits on
public lands administered by the Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't widely known that numerous banks in the West hold USFS
grazing permits on loans made to ranchers under the Forest
Service's escrow-waiver program.
</P>
<P>
   When a rancher defaults on one of these loans, the bank sells
the grazing permits along with the private property that was the
base for the permits and the loan. The grazing permits are, in
every sense, treated as property by these banks _ despite federal
appeals court rulings that a permittee has no legitimate claim of
entitlement to a grazing permit.
</P>
<P>
   If a rancher cannot treat his grazing permits as property, then
neither can a bank.
</P>
<P>
   Some ranchers in New Mexico, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming and Montana
hold USFS grazing permits on public-land acreage that far exceeds
their private property base. A rancher may own 1,000 acres and have
grazing permits on 80,000 adjacent acres. Naturally, the rancher's
grazing permits enhance the value of his private property.
</P>
<P>
   Forest Guardians wants to make any information concerning the
use of USFS grazing permits as loan collateral available to the
public _ the banks involved, the total amount of loans made on
grazing permits, the number of permittees, permits and acreage
involved.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Forest Service complied with a portion of the Forest
Guardians' FOIA request. However, the agency blacked out some
information that was pertinent to the request. After negotiations
came to a standstill in June 1999, the Forest Guardians filed a
lawsuit in federal court to get that missing information.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the Forest Service and Forest Guardians came to an
tentative agreement to provide that information.
</P>
<P>
   However, that same month before the lawsuit could be resolved, a
group of ranchers and banks filed a motion to intervene in the
case. They argued that the information released to Forest Guardians
should not be made public, that making such information public
violates the federal Privacy Act. They filed a motion to that
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Senior U.S. District Judge for the District of New Mexico Edwin
L. Mechem has allowed the ranchers and bankers to gag the Forest
Guardians since December. The judge has stalled and stalled on the
ranchers' and bankers' request for a temporary order to forbid the
distribution of the information about the widespread use of escrow
waivers.
</P>
<P>
   The judge is stalling for good reason. Legally, the judge cannot
prohibit the distribution of information gained through an FOIA
request.
</P>
<P>
   In a response to the motion by the ranchers and bankers, the
U.S. attorney's office in Albuquerque told the court it had no
legal authority to grant such a motion and ``it should be denied
out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom of Information Act only allows a federal court to
prohibit a federal agency from withholding agency records and to
order the release of records improperly withheld. The act does not
provide the court with any legal basis to stop the distribution of
information gained through an FOIA request.
</P>
<P>
   It stands to reason that any information released under an FOIA
request is public information. That's why the government was forced
to release it under the Freedom of Information Act.
</P>
<P>
   And the Privacy Act only authorizes a civil action against an
agency improperly releasing records. The act does not authorize an
action against those who received those records.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the information that the Forest Guardians have thus
far been prohibited from distributing to the public is available to
the public in every county courthouse in the West. A county
courthouse records deeds, loans and promissory notes on properties
within the county. And that information is available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the judge continues to stall on Forest Guardians'
right to distribute the information on USFS grazing permits used as
loan collateral.
</P>
<P>
   Mechem set a possible date for hearing arguments in May, but
that will be set further back because of a new filing by the cattle
and banking industries. In other words, the judge has put into
place a de facto illegal injunction that indefinitely prohibits
disseminating information on the USFS escrow-waiver program.
</P>
<P>
   Mechem, the former governor of New Mexico back in the 1950s,
shames himself by his actions in this case, and shames the robes he
wears as a federal judge. However protective he may feel about the
ranching industry, Mechem cannot legally gag the Forest Guardians.
The information they received from the Forest Service belongs to
the public.

&HT;     TREATING NAIL INFECTIONS CAN BE A MEAN FEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SYLVIA WOOD  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Barbara Ross-Cassidy spends all day working on
hands and feet, clipping, filing and polishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell a lot about somebody by their nails,'' said
Ross-Cassidy, who owns a nail salon in Saratoga Springs, 30 miles
north of Albany. ``If you're not taking in the right vitamins and
minerals, it will show.''
</P>
<P>
   Other problems, including fungal infections, are more
conspicuous, even to the untrained eye. You've probably seen the
symptoms in a dark, yellow thick toenail, or a scaly fingernail.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is finding a way to cure one of the most common and
stubborn of nail diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely frustrating and it's a hard problem to live
with,'' said Dr. Joseph S. Baler, chief of the division of
dermatology at St. Peter's Hospital in Albany and president of the
Capital District Dermatology Society and the Central New York
Dermatology Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you take the medicine and it works, there's still a
chance that it will come back again.''
</P>
<P>
   Nail infections affect up to 5 percent of Americans, causing
nails to become brittle, dry, discolored. In some cases, the
infections are so severe that they can cause pain with walking or
grasping objects.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, physicians have had only oral medications to
work with, including some with potentially serious side effects.
</P>
<P>
   In December, however, the Food and Drug Administration approved
a nail polish, the first ever, to treat hard-to-heal fungus
infections. Manufactured by Aventis Pharma Deutschland of
Frankfurt, Germany, Penlac is expected to be on pharmacy shelves
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most physicians acknowledge the problem is far from solved.
In various clinical trials, Penlac Nail Lacquer was effective in
only 5 percent to 12 percent of patients. Other topical treatments
have proved just as disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem in treating fungal infections is finding a
way to get medicine deposited into the nail so it can grow
normally, Baler said. Another is the prevalence of fungi.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 100,000 species worldwide, these simple parasitic
life forms are everywhere in our environment. In most cases, fungi
are harmless or beneficial to human health, from yeasts used in
baking and brewing to molds that are the source of antibiotic drugs
and mushrooms used in cooking.
</P>
<P>
   But some fungi can also cause illness and sometimes fatal
diseases in humans, especially those with compromised immune
systems as a result of AIDS, cancer or diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Nails are only one of the many potential targets. Jock itch and
yeast infections are also caused by fungi, as are some serious lung
and skin infections.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to nail infections, ``the prevalence increases
with age,'' said Dr. George Murakawa, chief of the division of
dermatology at Albany Medical Center. ``Most elderly will grow
fungus underneath their toenails.''
</P>
<P>
   The toes are also more susceptible than hands, mostly because
fungi like the warm, damp environment caused by foot perspiration
and ill-fitting shoes or socks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have wet, sweaty feet all the time, it wouldn't hurt to
use an over-the-counter, anti-fungal powder,'' Murakawa said.
</P>
<P>
   While keeping your feet and body dry are good preventive
strategies for fungal infections, Baler emphasizes that the problem
is not a hygiene issue. For reasons that aren't clear, some people
are believed to be more susceptible to nail infections than others.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it doesn't hurt to wear flip-flops when using the shower
at the gym. Or to make sure your nail salon uses only clean,
sterile equipment. Ross-Cassidy is especially meticulous about
getting her clients to take care of their nails.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can hide your feet,'' she said. ``But your hands are
always out there.''

&HT;     RESEARCHER WORKING ON EASIER WAY TO DETECT SLEEP DISORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SYLVIA WOOD  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ A computer program that can detect potentially
fatal episodes of sleep apnea may soon offer physicians an easier
and cheaper way to diagnose their patients.
</P>
<P>
   Michael I. Savic, a sound specialist and engineering professor
at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, is working to perfect the
program, which was created by recording real cases of the nighttime
breathing disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep apnea tends to affect people who snore and is
characterized by brief periods of being unable to breathe. The
condition, which afflicts some 18 million Americans, has been the
focus of increased interest in recent years because it has been
associated with excessive and dangerous daytime drowsiness,
especially among truck drivers.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, Savic's invention would allow physicians to
diagnose their patients without expensive stays in hospital-based
sleep centers. Left untreated, sleep apnea can cause sexual
dysfunction or death.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's suspected that someone has sleep apnea, instead of
taking him to the hospital you send him home with a microphone and
let him sleep,'' Savic said.
</P>
<P>
   Such a concept has a lot of potential, according to Dr. Douglas
Phelps, the director of the Sleep Disorders Program at the Stratton
Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Albany, which has been helping
Savic collect data.
</P>
<P>
   The project is a cooperative effort among physicians at the
Albany Medical Center, the Stratton VA and Savic.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep studies currently cost as much as $1,800, Phelps said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people who might have sleep apnea aren't
being tested either because it's too expensive or too
complicated,'' he said. ``If there were something more portable ...
there would be more testing and more cases found, and ultimately,
our highways would be safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Savic's solution is a tiny microphone attached to a patient's
pajamas.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of snoring then gets recorded. The informationis
later plugged into a computer that can identify sound wave patterns
associated with sleep apnea. Armed with this information,
physicians could then quickly diagnose the condition and refer
patients for appropriate care.
</P>
<P>
   Savic's latest project draws on years of sound research and a
long list of other successful machines, including a device used by
Walt Disney to transform voices and a system used by the Texaco oil
company to detect pipeline leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Savic has six patents in his name and another 50 based on his
work in sound and engineering. One of his latest projects, a device
that can separate sounds, was sold to the Canadian government.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Savic has been devoting more attention to
biotechnology projects, in part because the health care industry
tends to be well-funded. Savic also saw firsthand the potential for
improvements in the field after a 1996 hospital stay.
</P>
<P>
   One of Savic's biotech inventions is a hand-held device that can
identify dangerous deposits of cholesterol by sound.
</P>
<P>
   Savic's latest research on sleep apnea builds on his earlier
work. He is currently seeking funding from the National Institutes
of Health for the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun what I'm doing,'' Savic said. ``I enjoy it very
much.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    When the Internet magazine Salon went public last June, nobody
got obscenely rich.
 &HT;    The IPO did underwrite a few perks, however, that give the
company the appearance of new-economy prosperity.
 &HT;    Its swank new office in downtown San Francisco includes a
communal kitchen with an impressive stainless-steel fridge and a
balcony where the staff gathers for cocktails every Friday night.
 &HT;    On a recent day, at noon, David Talbot, Salon's chairman and
editor in chief, emerges from the weekly business meeting, his blue
eyes showing signs of bleariness. Driving to work earlier this
morning, he heard the news that AOL was merging with Time Warner.
The deal sent tremors through the whole Internet establishment, but
for Salon, it's the equivalent of a full-blown earthquake.
 &HT;    The homespun, seat-of-your-pants era of the Internet _ the era
in which Salon rose to prominence and which it, in some sense, grew
to symbolize _ is history. Forging strange alliances, old and new
media giants seem poised to carve up the Internet for themselves,
leaving maybe a few table scraps for independent outfits like
Salon.
 &HT;    In his 15th-floor office, Talbot is happy to talk business.
Specifically, he is intent on dispelling a myth that he fears is
depressing the price of his company's stock (which has been
languishing around $7 per share, about half of its peak price).
 &HT;    Salon is not, Talbot says seriously, a magazine.
 &HT;    Frankly, that's what it looks like to most people. On its Web
site, Salon covers culture, technology and politics. Garrison
Keillor writes a quirky advice column and Camille Paglia fires out
antifeminist provocations. At its best, it mixes polished writing
and a healthy disregard for the conventions of print journalism. At
its worst, the writer Dan Savage tries to infect Gary Bauer with
the flu. But we'll get to that later.
 &HT;    The point is, if Salon is not a magazine, what is it?
 &HT;    Talbot grabs a red marker and starts drawing a chart on a white
board that stands beside his desk. It is a routine that he has
probably performed countless times, but he does it with enthusiasm
and vigor.
 &HT;    He lists the key components of Salon's business and,
conspicuously, Print Content is merely one of five.
 &HT;    The others are as follows: Broadband, under which Talbot writes
Salon TV and Salon Radio. Salon now broadcasts programming put
together by the Dial, an on-line radio company, and later this year
will introduce an original mix of talk and music. A TV program is
set to make its debut in the fall on the Bravo channel.
 &HT;    Next on the list is E-commerce, which is essentially the site's
gift shop, where it sells T-shirts, coffee mugs, Salon compilations
and _ coming soon _ high-end writing utensils.
 &HT;    Then there's Media Sales, which means the hiring out of Salon's
ad sales team to other Web ventures. This arm of the company is a
work in progress too. So far the only client is a ticketing outfit
called CultureFinder.com.
 &HT;    And finally, there's Tech Projects. The design of Salon's Web
site is highly regarded, and Talbot wants to license this
architecture to other Internet companies.
 &HT;    So there it is, the Salon media empire. It still looks an awful
lot like a magazine. But it's easy to see what motivates Talbot. As
the new brand names of the industry seek to monopolize more and
more of the traffic on the Internet, Talbot is fighting to prevent
Salon from being marginalized as a virtuous bit player.
 &HT;    ``What I want Salon to be is a smart tabloid,'' he says. ``I
don't want to be publishing a highbrow zine for the literati. To
me, the great cultural models are the Beatles, Dylan, Francis Ford
Coppola, Martin Scorsese. These are people who have a very strong
creative vision but want a big audience. They didn't just want to
stay in art houses.''
 &HT;    As it is, Talbot is already at the mercy of forces much greater
than himself. Last year he paid $250,000 to be featured on AOL, a
deal that provided Salon with its greatest source of readers.
 &HT;    Talbot declines to confirm any hard figures, but word in the
industry is that when Salon approached AOL about upgrading its
placement, the new price for a two-year deal was in the mid-seven
figures. Given that AOL is acquiring all those Time Warner
magazines, eventually Salon may not be able to rent space on AOL
for any price.
 &HT;    Talbot's response to all this is to set Salon on a do-or-die
course to get big fast. And despite his elaborate pitch about
branching off into new ventures, his greatest project will be
transforming the magazine itself.
 &HT;    Steadily, he has been devoting more and more resources to
flashier news, celebrity coverage and gossip to attract a wider
audience. But his nascent empire _ and along with it the whole idea
of an independent Internet media company holding its own against
the conglomerates _ will amount to very little if he can't strike
the right balance between rewarding his loyal readers and pandering
to the masses.
 &HT;    The first thing everybody mentions about Talbot is his charisma.
There is a Clinton-like aspect to his character _ ``I like an
audience that claps,'' he says at one point _ and in his presence,
it's hard not to be won over by nearly everything he says.
 &HT;    He thrives on creative tension, a talent he probably learned
from being brought up in a highly polarized household. Talbot's
father, a talented Hollywood actor who never made it big, was a
Goldwater man and used to drag the children to Nixon rallies. His
mother, an ex-showgirl, supported Kennedy, Johnson and the Great
Society. (His sister, Margaret, is a contributing writer for The
Times Magazine.)
 &HT;    In terms of political leanings, David took after his mother _ he
grew up into a lefty journalist, collaborated on a book about
Americans' sexual habits and eventually went to work as an editor
at Mother Jones.
 &HT;    But he never did quite fit the mold. One of his articles in the
early 1980s suggested that the emerging entrepreneurial culture of
Silicon Valley might have socially liberating effects. In 1986,
Talbot was recruited to The San Francisco Examiner by the
publisher, William Randolph Hearst III, who wanted him to shake up
its arts coverage. He did just that, but to a degree that often
created problems.
 &HT;    ``If you got two or three angry letters, it caused huge
ripples,'' Talbot recalls. ``I think the Internet came along at
this marvelous time, because the media had become so timid, so
politically correct, so dumbed down, so marketing driven.''
 &HT;    Talbot discovered the Web during a rancorous strike when Scott
Rosenberg, then a film critic for The Examiner, helped publish a
union paper on the Internet. It required no newsprint, no ink, no
pressmen, no trucks and no drivers.
 &HT;    In search of liberation, that eternal California soundtrack,
Talbot made the jump to the on-line world in 1995 _ along with
Rosenberg, now Salon's technology columnist and managing editor,
and Gary Kamiya, its executive editor _ and eventually he hired
away some of The Examiner's most talented writers and editors.
 &HT;    Start-up money came from Apple: first $60,000, then another
$40,000 _ meager sums by today's standards, but enough to finance a
modest weekly Web zine that was primarily about books. The business
side evolved slowly.
 &HT;    ``In those days, you would sit down with somebody, and you
weren't sure if you were supposed to pay them or if they were
supposed to pay you,'' remembers David Zweig, Salon's first
publisher. ``It was like being in outer space. You had no way of
getting your bearings.''
 &HT;    Over the next two years John Warnock, the CEO of Adobe Systems,
steered $5 million to Salon. The editors took advantage of freedom
they never had before.
 &HT;    A peculiarly West Coast sensibility reigned. Laura Miller, who
worked for a feminist erotica cooperative in San Francisco before
joining Salon (and is now the New York bureau chief), says that the
staff defined itself in opposition to the ``status-obsessed
culture'' of New York.
 &HT;    Talbot lured new readers with coverage of family matters,
technology, academia, media and sex. Courtney Weaver's Unzipped
column was an early hit. It was sometimes erotic, sometimes just
plain dirty.
 &HT;    Talbot also provided an outlet for unusually intimate memoirs
and stark confessionals. Anne Lamott, writing about everything from
parenthood to spirituality, developed into a star attraction. So
did James Poniewozik, a media columnist who was eventually hired
away by Time magazine.
 &HT;    Talbot assembled a fiercely loyal team of editors and writers _
and along with it an equally committed readership. By the time of
its IPO, Salon was drawing 1.2 million visitors a month.
 &HT;    The glorious naivete of salon's early days could not last,
however. Virtual magazines started popping up all over the place,
and some had real business plans and ideas about making money.
Salon had to get with it.
 &HT;    So back in 1996, after Zweig and Talbot split over which
commercial alliances to pursue, Talbot brought in Michael
O'Donnell, a former salesman of software and computer games. An
evangelist of growth, O'Donnell describes Salon's target audience
as ``upscale mass market,'' a term that no one would have taken
seriously until a few short years ago.
 &HT;    ``We're not really aiming to be The New Yorker of the Web,''
O'Donnell says. ``The market we're going after is the market that
watches 'Seinfeld.'''
 &HT;    One of O'Donnell's first moves was to hire an enterprising young
man named Alexander Hughes as Salon's circulation manager. Hughes
viewed the Internet as ``the ultimate Skinner box,'' by which he
meant a highly accurate gauge of human behavior.
 &HT;    Borrowing concepts from HotWired, he redesigned Salon's
architecture to track the way traffic moved through the site in
stunning detail.
 &HT;    With Hughes' system, Talbot can tell exactly how many readers
visit Salon, and by what means they arrive. He can tell what
departments readers go to, which articles they click on and whether
they make it to the last page. Most content providers have access
to some traffic information, but few know as much about their flow
as Salon does.
 &HT;    ``What we built allows you, on a daily, weekly, monthly or
annual basis, to analyze whether you are breaking even on any given
piece of content,'' explains Hughes, who now works at C/Net, a site
for high-tech products. ``For each story, you can answer the
question, Did we pay for this?''
 &HT;    Having access to this information had a huge psychic impact on
Salon's writers and editors. Suddenly they were privy to the print
equivalent of Nielsen ratings.
 &HT;    ``At The Examiner, I thought: Aha, I work at a newspaper with a
circulation of half a million people! Therefore, half a million
people read my stories,'' Rosenberg says. ``Of course, it wasn't
true, but we never got our faces shoved in it.''
 &HT;    Lately, an average of 110,000 people have been visiting Salon
per day. Perhaps one-fifth of them click on Rosenberg's technology
column. Knowing precisely how many people read his column ``is a
shock at first,'' he admits. ``But once you know the numbers, you
can't imagine doing without them.''
 &HT;    Salon's editors have learned to be vague when speaking to
writers about traffic stats. But everyone understands how the
system works _ that if the word ``breasts'' is used in a cover
link, traffic will go off the charts, and that articles about
foreign news go virtually unread.
 &HT;    The tabloidy stuff almost always scores high. The two articles
Salon ran about the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in August
1997 attracted record numbers of traffic. Last year, an
unremarkable article about the death of John F. Kennedy Jr. was
Salon's most widely read item _ it got more than 250,000 hits.
 &HT;    These numbers make Talbot's job easier in obvious respects, but
a lot more complicated in others.
 &HT;    ``It's daunting, because, you know, if Anne Lamott's page views
are going down, what do you do?'' he says. ``I think you don't
necessarily pull the plug on someone. Garrison Keillor, for
instance, started out slow, and now his column is one of our top
page-drivers. Sometimes you have to be patient. Other times, if you
see some long trend, it does give you a warning signal. You say,
'Well, does this jibe with your sense that the writer is running
out of steam?'''
 &HT;    Among Salon's impressive moments, a freelancer, Daniel Forbes,
broke the story in January about the collusion between network TV
producers and White House policy makers to embed antidrug messages
in prime-time shows. Every other media outlet in the country played
catch-up, and in a matter of days the practice was halted. It went
a long way in establishing Salon as a reputable news organization.
 &HT;    But weeks later that momentum was squandered when Dan Savage,
who writes a nationally syndicated sex column, was assigned to
write about the Republican presidential hopeful Gary Bauer.
 &HT;    Savage describes himself as deeply offended by Bauer's anti-gay
rhetoric, and he set out to retaliate. Masquerading as a volunteer
for the candidate, he tried (unsuccessfully) to infect Bauer with
the flu by licking doorknobs, pens and coffee cups in the campaign
office.
 &HT;    When Savage's bizarre account was published in Salon, Talbot was
hit with a barrage of criticism. He responded in curious fashion,
posting this disclaimer on Salon: ``We still believe publishing the
article was the right choice, but we also feel compelled to say: We
didn't assign Savage to infect Bauer. We don't condone or endorse
what he says he did.''
 &HT;    Salon editors, in other words, not only disavowed responsibility
for their reporter's conduct, they also wouldn't vouch for the
veracity of what he had written.
 &HT;    Toward the end of last year, Salon experienced a surge in
traffic. In December, the number of people who visited Salon jumped
to 3.4 million, up from 1.9 million in September. Advertising is up
sharply too. Total revenues rose to $3 million last quarter, a 193
percent increase over the year before. Plus, the IPO last June
brought in $26 million, and just before that O'Donnell raised $15
million from private sources.
 &HT;    But money is still going out faster than it is coming in. Salon
has only enough cash on hand to survive for a year and a half.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, takeover rumors circulate. In the past, both
Amazon.com and Time Warner have tried to buy Salon. Last year,
Bravo expressed interest in a bigger piece of the company. So far,
Talbot and O'Donnell have rebuffed all offers. This may be because
the bids were low.
 &HT;    Or perhaps Talbot is stubborn enough to hang on to his creation.
``My dream is that I would pass it along to the next generation,
and that they would keep it independent,'' he says. ``It would be a
shame if Salon were gobbled by a major media company.''
 &HT;    Yes, it's not too hard to imagine what a bunch of suits would do
with that artfully constructed ``Skinner box.''

 THE FEAR of LOATHING on the CAMPAIGN TRAIL

 &HT;    (--Latin America: ANA PENA in New York, 310-996-0075; fax, By JAMES BENNET  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Earlier this month, as the Republican contenders for president
were bickering over who was the bigger meanie, I paid a visit to
Greg Stevens, who was hard at work creating two commercials for his
candidate, John McCain, in a rent-by-the-hour video editing studio
across the river from Washington in Arlington, Va.
 &HT;    The son of a minister, Stevens, who is 51, speaks in mild tones
and dresses in muted colors. That day he was wearing pressed gray
flannels, a light gray shirt and a dark gray and black sweater. His
commercials, in contrast, sparkle with color, swoop through
blurring camera pans, shake with sound.
 &HT;    Of the TV ads Stevens was producing, one, called ``Leader,'' was
the kind that political operatives and obliging reporters refer to
as ``positive.'' It was a 30-second confection intended to
introduce McCain to California viewers.
 &HT;    The second spot had a less inspiring name. ``OK, Polly,''
Stevens said, shortly after I entered the shadowy studio. ``I guess
we can go to the 'New Low.'''
 &HT;    Polly Bryan, a video editor, drew a stylus across a flat control
panel, and the image of George W. Bush, bigger than life, smirked
on three screens, a five-foot screen against one wall and two
smaller desktop ones.
 &HT;    Nearly 12 years ago, it was Stevens who burned the now-legendary
image of Michael Dukakis peeping from a tank into our collective
memory. Now he was working on finding a similar place in the
American mind for a smirking Bush. The new commercial used
slow-motion footage of a startlingly goofy Bush to mock him as
having reached a ``new all-time low'' in attacking McCain's record
on assisting veterans. But Stevens was not satisfied with the cut.
 &HT;    The last image, a head-on shot of McCain speaking in front of an
aircraft carrier, was not dramatic enough to create the hoped-for
contrast between one man who should be president and another who
should be spanked.
 &HT;    On Stevens' instructions, Bryan used her machine _ a sort of
image processor with cut and paste tools like a word processor's _
to copy frames from existing footage of McCain and stick them into
``New Low.''
 &HT;    Dizzyingly, McCain's image jerked back and forth, and his brisk
voice spoke normally and in reverse, as she adjusted the new clip
to fit near the end of the advertisement.
 &HT;    ``Let's try it 20 frames sooner,'' said Stevens, who is known as
a perfectionist in his trade. (To give you a sense of the hair he
was splitting, there are 30 frames in a second, 900 in a 30-second
commercial.)
 &HT;    In the end, none of this effort mattered. No voter ever saw this
commercial.
 &HT;    Even as Bush intensified his barrage of critical advertising in
South Carolina and Michigan, McCain ultimately decided to put ``New
Low'' on the shelf and to rely only on positive commercials such as
``Leader'' in a bid to reclaim the high ground.
 &HT;    Earlier he had seemingly abandoned that high ground by
broadcasting a spot comparing Bush to Bill Clinton. History may
someday sort out whether or not this attack ad hurt McCain. What is
already clear is that it, along with Bush's more frequent attacks,
fueled one of the most tiresome aspects of this campaign: grown men
calling each other negative ... and then calling each other
negative for calling each other negative.
 &HT;    Yes, the doubling negatives have served as a kind of proxy
debate over the character of the candidates, but that debate is not
terribly enlightening.
 &HT;    Any debate about TV spots and radio ads and the nature of
telephone polls is ultimately a debate about tactics rather than
issues and agendas. That is, it's the very sort of insider
preoccupation that the critics of negativity say they want to
avoid.
 &HT;    Perhaps the most unsatisfying aspect of this debate about
negative campaigning is that, having monumentally distracted the
political world, it has not addressed directly the basic questions
it raised.
 &HT;    Are negative advertisements so much worse than positive ones? Is
either category actually a bad thing? And does either really
matter? The answers are no, no and a lot less than you probably
think.
 &HT;    At the national level, the brainwashing powers of political
advertising have long been exaggerated _ in part by some
advertising men, who make their money on commission, as a
percentage of the purchase of TV time. Given the rise of channel
surfing, mute buttons, the Internet and irony, traditional
advertising is becoming only less effective, in the view of a
number of media consultants.
 &HT;    What still matters most in a national race, candidates and
operatives will tell you, is what they rather patronizingly call
``earned'' or ``free'' media _ the press.
 &HT;    McCain has proved that this year. Even as his campaign was
taking off, he could not afford much advertising. On the other
hand, Steve Forbes proved _ as he already had in '96 _ that
abundant and skillfully produced advertising can get you only so
far.
 &HT;    Now, paradoxically, one way to ``earn'' free media is through
advertising, particularly negative advertising. Reporters tend not
to build stories around spots like ``Leader,'' a paean to one
candidate, but they are very likely to pay attention to ads in
which one candidate levels a charge against another.
 &HT;    And so Stevens had intended to pay to broadcast ``New Low'' only
a handful of times, knowing that news programs, delighting in its
acerbity, would work up stories about Bush and veterans and then
broadcast the commercial free.
 &HT;    There is really nothing wrong with this. One role of campaign
reporters is to relay and evaluate what the candidates are saying,
in their ads as on the stump, and they are simply doing their jobs
when they analyze such attacks.
 &HT;    One of the grounds that critics use in attacking negative
advertisements is that they twist the truth _ without necessarily
breaking it _ by manipulating words and images to undercut an
opponent. Yet positive commercials can be just as manipulative and
sometimes less truthful than negative ones.
 &HT;    Indeed, so-called positive ads are just as likely to rely on
anonymous narration that skips inconvenient details, music that
summons emotions, and images stripped of context _ all of this
carefully arranged to tell the producer's chosen story.
 &HT;    Now, turning attention to his positive spot, Stevens led me down
a hall in the warren of windowless studios to a room where Steven
Lipton, another editor, was assembling the images for ``Leader.''
 &HT;    Like other employees of the studio, Lipton, 33, is a gun for
hire. He once cut a commercial for Bill Clinton and one for Bob
Dole in the same room on the same day, erasing all traces of one
campaign's work before the next entered.
 &HT;    Stevens had written the script for ``Leader'' the night before.
He usually does write a script first, then scribbles in the margins
what images _ which he believes are far more important than the
words _ should go with each line.
 &HT;    ``A young Navy pilot who volunteered for duty in Vietnam,''
boomed the bass Voice of God _ actually, the voice of Terry
MacDonald, a burly actor with a wry wit _ as pictures of a youthful
McCain flashed by on a large screen.
 &HT;    Following Stevens' written instructions for the imagery
(``Reagan,'' ``big crowd,'' ``flag profile''), Lipton had spliced
shots of a pilot bailing out of a falling plane with footage of
McCain in prison in Hanoi along with scenes of him with Ronald
Reagan and on the campaign trail. The parachutist, however, was not
McCain; the campaign purchased footage of an unnamed pilot from the
military.
 &HT;    The closing shot showed McCain standing before a blue field of
stars as he earnestly addressed a crowd. In fact, the senator,
deadpan, was telling a joke about how, when he showed up with his
kids on the first day of school, a teacher congratulated him for
bringing his grandchildren.
 &HT;    But as the narration gave these images new meanings, the
pictures now told a compact, powerful story with no punch lines.
That story was true enough, but the ad, in reality, was more
postmodern pastiche than documentary.
 &HT;    Indeed, this ``positive'' commercial had managed to underscore
implicitly that McCain, unlike Bush, had gone to Vietnam, not into
the National Guard. Just imagine the reaction to a spot that
bluntly, negatively, made the same point.
 &HT;    By now, Rick Davis, McCain's campaign manager, had entered the
room. Watching the ``Leader'' spot, he arrived at a new concern.
``You've got to have a female announcer,'' he said.
 &HT;    Stevens rolled his eyes.
 &HT;    ``It's California,'' Davis continued. ``We've got to get out of
a South Carolina mindset.''
 &HT;    Stevens suggested that there was no evidence that women
responded more to female voices. In fact, he said, there was some
evidence that they were put off by them.
 &HT;    Soon Jay Payne, Stevens' production manager, set to work with
Lipton editing ``Leader'' _ which is to say, manipulating the
sounds and images _ while scarfing down lasagna from the production
studio's mess. Payne, a 25-year-old from South Carolina, had been
in the studio until 3:30 that morning, and his thick, brown goatee
was merging into several days' worth of beard.
 &HT;    Payne and Lipton began riffling their file footage for a good
sound bite. They settled on a shot of McCain declaring to a crowd,
``I'm going to give the government back to you, and I promise you
that.''
 &HT;    But there was a hitch. McCain was speaking outside, and the
preceding image was of an indoor rally.
 &HT;    ``You can't lead in from that crowd now,'' Payne warned.
 &HT;    Lipton eliminated the crowd shot, then went searching for a good
outdoor crowd to follow McCain's remark.
 &HT;    ``I don't want a shot of that guy,'' Payne said, as a man in
dark glasses and a tie appeared. ``He looks like he's in the Secret
Service.''
 &HT;    Lipton finally found a nice crowd shot at the same event at
which McCain was speaking. People of varying ages, oblivious to
Stevens' cameraman, were listening intently and then clapping.
 &HT;    But they were not clapping loudly enough. So Lipton embarked on
a hunt for better crowd noise. The cheering and whistling from
another event sounded ``too young,'' he concluded, and the sounds
from other rallies he sampled at head-spinning speed did not work
either.
 &HT;    He returned to the original speech and fast-forwarded, turning
the senator into a caffeinated chipmunk, until he found a
satisfying cheer. He picked up that piece of sound and laid it over
his preferred crowd shot. So in the end, a group of people clapped
and cheered with others' hands and voices for a remark no one seen
or heard in the ad was actually applauding.
 &HT;    As a presentation of reality, ``Leader'' had become as
misleading as many other campaign commercials, positive, negative
or otherwise. Still, as a representation of one reality _ of the
dynamism of the McCain campaign _ it was dead on.
 &HT;    After lunch, Stevens pushed a sheaf of papers toward me.
Political organizers still think in terms of precincts and
counties. But Stevens is reaching voters through their televisions,
not their front doors. So he was working off color-coded maps of
the media markets in California and elsewhere that listed the
percentage of the Republican vote that would come from each.
 &HT;    Stevens can cut a commercial in about 12 hours, at a cost of
$12,000 to $15,000. The great expense in TV advertising comes when
you put it on the air. And so by using ratings data, some pop
psychology and sophisticated computer programs, campaigns carefully
pick particular times and particular shows to ship their messages
to particular voters.
 &HT;    Ideally, Stevens wants every viewer to see an ad 10 to 12 times
to absorb its message. He tends to buy time during morning and
evening news programs, as well as during ``Nightline,'' to reach
the audience that is most likely to go to the polls. Then he
pursues prime-time slots to get the most possible viewers.
 &HT;    Going a step further, Stevens planned to place ``Leader'' during
``Oprah,'' ``Judge Judy,'' ``Live With Regis and Kathie Lee'' and
even an afternoon rerun of ``Matlock'' in hopes of appealing to the
suburban women McCain has had trouble rallying.
 &HT;    Later, as he screened the revised ``Leader,'' Stevens murmured,
``That's good ... good, good, good.''
 &HT;    The McCain campaign is not testing its advertisements in focus
groups or polls. Generally, Stevens just picks the images and
sounds he thinks are most effective, freely incorporating the
suggestions of his underlings or colleagues.
 &HT;    The new version of ``Leader'' with McCain speaking, he readily
conceded, was better than the original. He scribbled out some
graphics, like ``Ready to Lead,'' which he handed over to Bryan,
who had now taken control of the commercial to edit it on a
superior and _ at $500 an hour _ more expensive machine.
 &HT;    As Bryan worked, and narrative shards like ``defying special
interests'' periodically filled the room, Stevens talked about his
candidate and advertising.
 &HT;    ``He hates this,'' Stevens said. ``He understands its value, but
it's something that isn't reality to him.''
 &HT;    Unlike McCain, his candidate, Stevens is fascinated by
advertising, with its simultaneous appeals to two senses, its iron
discipline of money and time, its overt messages and subtle cues
and its blend of politics and art, high technology and sometimes
low blows.
 &HT;    McCain's decision to shelve ``New Low'' may have been the only
one he could have made politically, given his image as an
unconventional candidate. But his decision should not be read as
addressing the underlying question of whether negative advertising
should have a place in campaigns generally, including in primaries.
It should.
 &HT;    Granted, politics would probably be more enlightening if
political advertising, positive or negative, relied less on
gimmickry. Campaigns would surely be better if candidates told
their own stories and made their own attacks, addressing the camera
directly in their commercials.
 &HT;    But don't make the easy assumption that politics would be more
serious and more moral if all candidates were positive all of the
time.
 &HT;    The truth is not always pretty, and there can be just as much of
it in a slow-motion smirk as in a cheering crowd.

TAX RULES ON SALE OF HOUSE REVISED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By SHANNON BUGGS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Nearly 55,000 homes were sold in Houston last year,
the most ever in one year.
</P>
<P>
   Since selling a home is not a yearly event for most people, this
tax season may be confusing to those who have to account for those
sales on their tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't been keeping up with the changes in the tax code,
you are in for a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Congress repealed the rule that allowed home sellers to
defer for two years paying taxes on any gains from selling their
primary residence, to roll over the gains tax-free into a new home,
or to be exempt from paying taxes on gains of up to $125,000 if
they were 55 years or older.
</P>
<P>
   I repeat: Taxpayers no longer have to buy another home or be age
55 to avoid paying taxes on the profit they make when they sell
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Congress replaced the rule with a tax exemption on up to
$250,000 in profits on a house sale, or up to $500,000 for married
couples filing joint returns.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TWO-YEAR RESIDENCE REQUIRED &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for this tax break, sellers have to meet two
requirements, but one of them has some flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers can keep all the gains on a house as long as they have
not sold another primary residence in the past two years and if
they lived in the house for two of the five years before they sold
it.
</P>
<P>
   The law does not say that the person has to live in the home for
two consecutive years. So a person could live in a house for one
year, rent it for three, move back in for a year _ and keep all the
profit when she sells it at the end of that year, says E. Rhett
Buck, a certified public accountant and tax attorney.
</P>
<P>
   There's another loophole in the rule. People can get a prorated
tax exemption on any capital gains even if they sell the home
before the 24-month time period if there is a change in the
taxpayer's health, employment or other unforeseen circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Those can include taking a job in another city, divorce, the
birth of a child or other events that force people to sell their
homes, says Juanita Dailey, a tax law specialist in the Houston
office of the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   To calculate the prorated exemption, you take the number of
months you lived in the home, divide it by 24 months and multiply
that by the $250,000 single-filer exemption or the $500,000
joint-filer exemption.
</P>
<P>
   For this tax year alone, you can get the prorated exemption
without having to show that you moved for an unexpected reason _ if
you sold your house before Aug. 5, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HOME-TRANSACTION FORM ABOLISHED &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most confusing part of all these changes is that there is no
form for you to file with the IRS to account for the gains. Home
sales used to be accounted for on Form 2119, which would be
attached to a return, but that is no longer necessary, says Dailey.
</P>
<P>
   You also don't have to include home sales on a Schedule D for
capital gains and losses, although you might want to if your title
company sends you a form 1099S.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past 10 years, title companies have been told to send
out those forms,'' says Greta Hicks, a CPA and former IRS manager.
``Now the burden is on the title company to determine if it's a
taxable event for each of their clients, and a lot of them just
don't have the time to figure it out, so they send the form to
everyone.''

   If that happens to you and you qualify for the exemption,
contact your title company and ask for a corrected 1099S, stating
that you are exempt. If the title company is not helpful, submit
the 1099S with your return and a letter to the IRS saying that you
are exempt.

&HT;     COOKS TURN CREATIVE IN ANNUAL BAKING CONTEST 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By EMILY GURNON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco, the home of renown chefs and
restaurants, played host to 99 amateur cooks from across the
country who competed in the 50th anniversary Pillsbury Bake-Off
cooking contest.
</P>
<P>
   The $1 million grand prize was awarded Tuesday to Roberta
``Bobbie'' Sonefeld of Hopkins, S.C. Her dessert contest entry was
Cream Cheese Brownie Pie.
</P>
<P>
   Decked out in blue Pillsbury aprons, the contestants lined up at
their ovens in the Marriott Hotel ballroom at 8 a.m. Monday and
proceeded to show off their culinary innovations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I entered the very first (contest), and I have dreamed of this
for 50 years,'' said Pat Parsons, 75, of Bakersfield, Calif., who
became one of the 100 finalists (one couldn't make it because she's
expecting a baby and cannot travel) with her recipe for Guess Again
Candy Crunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting into this contest has been one of the goals of my
life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In order to qualify, contestants had to create original recipes
that use a Pillsbury product _ which includes brands owned by
Pillsbury's parent company, such as Hungry Jack, Old El Paso,
Progresso and Green Giant. They chose one of four categories: Easy
Weeknight Meals, Fast &AMP; Fabulous Desserts &AMP; Treats, Yummy
Vegetables or Casual Snacks &AMP; Appetizers.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons got inspired to make her dish by looking at the list of
this year's qualifying ingredients. One of them was Progresso bread
crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, what's the most unusual thing you can make with
bread crumbs? And I thought, candy!'' She called it Guess Again
because ``nobody can guess what makes it crunchy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so easy,'' she said. ``And the only cooking I do is melt
chocolate in the microwave.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Quick and easy'' was the theme of this year's contest, which
has evolved considerably since its debut in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original idea was, how do we get people excited about
flour?'' said George Pillsbury, 78, whose grandfather, Charles A.
Pillsbury, started the Minneapolis company in 1869.
</P>
<P>
   An advertising agency came up with the notion for a contest, and
the first winner, according to Pillsbury archives, was Mrs. Ralph
E. Smafield of Rockford, Ill., who won for her recipe for
Water-Rising Twists, a nut sweet roll raised under water.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons Pillsbury continues to hold the contest is to
get a ``peek into America's kitchens,'' said Pillsbury spokeswoman
Marlene Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the years, recipes have changed with America's tastes
and cooks' time restraints.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we see are a lot of bold, impactful flavors in
recipes,'' Johnson said. ``America's palates are not timid
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The average age of all the finalists was 46.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest was Lauren Eggeman of Massillon, Ohio, who became a
finalist with her original recipe, Sugar and Spice Black Pepper
Cookies, made with Pillsbury Cinnamon Swirl Quick Bread and Coffee
Cake mix.
</P>
<P>
   At the ripe old age of 11, Eggeman is a veteran cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was, like, 2, I watched my mom, and when I was, like, 5
or 6, I would make my own things, never measure anything,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She got the idea for adding pepper to her cookies from her
grandmother, who used to do the same thing. ``My mom said it tasted
really good,'' Lauren said.
</P>
<P>
   This year, mangoes are in. So is coffee or coffee-flavored
dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Patrice Hurd, 44, of Bemidji, Minn., dreamed up her creation,
Crescent Potato Puffs, over nine months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every night as I drifted off to sleep, I thought of food
combinations, and something different you could do with the
(qualifying) products,'' she said. She kept a pencil and paper by
the bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been cooking and baking all of my life, and if you
bake, this is the contest,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When the entry period was over, Hurd said, ``I could not sleep.
I had nothing to think about.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Sonefeld, the other category winners who each won
$10,000 were:
</P>
<P>
   _ Lorraine Maggio of Manlius, N.Y., baked the winning Easy
Weeknight Meals dish, Ham and Swiss Crescent Braid.
</P>
<P>
   _ Judith Mettlin of Snyder, N.Y., prepared the top Yummy
Vegetables recipe, Island Paradise Salad.
</P>
<P>
   _ Judy Wood of Vestavia Hills, Ala., was category winner in
Casual Snacks &AMP; Appetizers with Pesto Crescent Twists with Feta
Spread.
</P>
<P>
   The three finalists in each category who won $2,000 prizes were:
</P>
<P>
   _ Kristine Snyder of Kihei, Hawaii; Betsy Dell of Rochester,
N.Y.; and Debra Kelly of Wheeling, Ill. (Easy Weeknight Meals)
</P>
<P>
   _ Inez Duke of Mars Hill, N.C.; Rosemary Leicht of Bethel, Ohio;
and Mary Jones of Cumberland, Maine (Yummy Vegetables)
</P>
<P>
   _ Janice Kollar of Woodbridge, N.J.; Marge Bergemann of
Greenbelt, Md.; and Heather Wight of Los Angeles (Fast &AMP; Fabulous
Desserts &AMP; Treats)
</P>
<P>
   _ Kelly Roos of Pottsville, Pa.; Thomas Stuteville of Parsons,
Kan.; and Tracie Ojakangas of Springfield, Mo., (Casual Snacks &AMP;
Appetizers)
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the GE Innovation Award was Pat Parsons of
Bakersfield, Calif. She won a GE Profile Performance Kitchen
(valued at $5,000) for her recipe, Guess Again Candy Crunch.

 THE GRUNTS of GROZNY  
 &HT;     (This article has already moved to Centerpiece clients. To
publish as a ``separate buy'' article, it must be purchased _ the
rate is not prohibitive _ from one of these New York Times
Syndicate sales representatives:

 &HT;    (--Latin America: ANA PENA in New York, 310-996-0075; fax, By MICHAEL GORDON  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The first thing Lt. Vyacheslav Kiselyov did before leading his
platoon into Grozny was to yank the metal plates from his
bulletproof vest, leaving only the panel that covered his heart.
Then he crammed the jacket with extra cartridges of ammunition.
 &HT;    It was one of those trade-offs Russian soldiers make to maximize
their chances of survival.
 &HT;    The regular supply of ammo _ four magazines with 32 cartridges
each _ is good for only about 20 minutes of fighting. The fire from
Chechen rebels can sometimes get so intense, however, that it
sounds like eggs on a griddle, and Vyacheslav felt his best
protection was having enough bullets to answer back.
 &HT;    He also put aside his helmet. It was nice to have if you were
manning a checkpoint. But when a soldier has to run for his life
and dodge snipers, the ill-fitting helmet just gets in the way.
 &HT;    As Vyacheslav recalled not long ago, he was creeping up on a
warehouse in the eastern part of Grozny when he saw that two of his
soldiers were pinned against the ground, bullets whizzing over
their heads.
 &HT;    He began lobbing smoke grenades so that they could make their
escape. It was then that a 5.45-millimeter bullet ripped into his
hand.
 &HT;    That, Vyacheslav now says, was a bit of luck. If it had been a
7.62-millimeter, it would have torn off a finger.
 &HT;    Vyacheslav told me his tale in Room No. 8, which was not a room
at all but a tent set up on the grounds of the military hospital in
Mozdok, just a few miles northwest of the Republic of Chechnya.
 &HT;    He spoke in a low monotone, as if he were talking about another
soldier in some far-off battle. It was a dirty little war, but it
was his lot to fight it. He had not bothered to tell his parents
about his wound. It would only worry them, and there was nothing
really that they could do.
 &HT;    ``I don't know whether we are fighting for the motherland or
not,'' Vyacheslav said. ``But if it was up to me all the bandits
would be destroyed. It's not nice to see your friend's head blown
off by a grenade.''
 &HT;    I was one of a handful of foreigners who had tagged along with
Russian TV crews as they helicoptered in and out of Chechnya this
winter, the Russian forces blasting their way into the Chechen
capital. An obsequious military press service generated publicity
for Russia's field commanders.
 &HT;    These officers were a blustery lot, boasting about their
triumphs and reveling in the medals that Vladimir Putin, Russia's
acting president, bestowed on them. What interested me, though, was
not these officers but the soldiers who fought under them _ young
men who, like Chechnya's civilians, bore the brunt of Russia's
``victories.''
 &HT;    These soldiers were not the grizzled combat veterans the Kremlin
insisted it was sending to the front. They were untested conscripts
plucked from Russian factories and farms in the provinces,
down-on-their-luck mercenaries unable to find steady work at home,
militiamen more accustomed to policing a rock concert than
searching for snipers.
 &HT;    And they were young officers like Vyacheslav, who went to a
military school to become a border guard and never imagined he
would end up in the Chechen caldron.
 &HT;    They suffered thousands of casualties in the course of seizing a
ruined capital and chasing bands of battle-hardened militants into
their lairs in the Caucasus mountains. No one considered himself a
hero, and nobody was anticipating any parades when, or if, he
returned home.
 &HT;    In Mozdok, a dismal military town, besieged by fog and drowning
in a sea of mud, the hospital where I met Vyacheslav is situated
inside a guarded compound near the base. According to official
figures, more than 1,100 Russian soldiers and Interior Ministry
troops have been killed and more than 3,500 wounded since the
campaign in Chechnya began Oct. 1.
 &HT;    Even before the Kremlin began to acknowledge that casualties
were high, it was obvious in Mozdok. You don't erect a small tent
city in winter on the grounds of a hospital unless you have run out
of room to accommodate the wounded. Some of those wounded die after
reaching the hospital but are not listed as having been killed in
action. They are included in a separate, Orwellian category: Those
who perished as a result of trauma.
 &HT;    When I spoke with Col. Vladimir Ivantsov, the deputy chief of
the military's medical service here, he explained that the wounds
suffered by soldiers in Grozny were particularly severe because
troops fighting block by block in a city are likely to meet the
enemy up close _ and be met by accurately fired bullets.
 &HT;    ``There are more head injuries, more brain and skull injuries
and more abdominal injuries too,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, our
soldiers don't always use their protective gear, and large-caliber
bullets can punch through our bulletproof vests.''
 &HT;    Snipers took their toll. And though Ivantsov did not say it, so
did Russian ``friendly fire'' from artillery and air strikes.
 &HT;    The generals like to boast about their ``precision strikes.'' In
the time I was in Chechnya, I never heard a general admit to a
single instance of friendly fire. The soldiers often talked about
it, however, with the same resignation that they spoke of the
frigid weather.
 &HT;    The assault on Grozny was carried out by a hodgepodge of units
with somewhat convoluted command relations: Interior Ministry
troops, the Russian army, militia from Russian cities,
rapid-reaction teams and pro-Russian Chechens. The Russian troops
in Grozny said the pro-Russian Chechens followed behind during the
assault on the capital.
 &HT;    The Mozdok hospital offered terrible evidence of the Russian
army's fighting in Chechnya. Noncommissioned officers,
inexperienced conscripts and ``kontraktniki'' _ generally older
mercenaries who sign six-month to one-year contracts and fight for
pay, a totally unknown category in the old Soviet army _ all were
represented in the Mozdok hospital.
 &HT;    When I visited, Room No. 8, which also doubles as a ward, had
about 20 double-decker bunks pressed together.
 &HT;    Vyacheslav told me he was born in the Amur region of eastern
Siberia, a stunning swath of coniferous forests, rivers and dormant
volcanoes, and wanted to be a forester when he grew up. ``I used to
pick up my rifle and go to the taiga every weekend to hunt,'' he
said. ``I'd go after small game like wolverine, or if I went with
some of my relatives we might go after bear.''
 &HT;    But he is also a young man from the old school _ that is, part
of that shrinking sliver of Russian society that still aspires to
join the military, a faint echo of the old Soviet patriotism. He
found that the soldier's life was not so bad at first. The troops
fed on kasha and tins of meat. Mail arrived once a week. There was
only one radio for the soldiers of his unit, but it was enough to
allow them to follow the news, which was not particularly grim.
There was fighting, but it was limited, and the Russians soon had
things under control.
 &HT;    It might have all ended in Dagestan for Vyacheslav had not
President Boris Yeltsin installed Putin as Russia's prime minister.
Putin, a former KGB officer determined to make his mark as a
Russian strongman, saw Chechnya not as a quagmire, but as an
opportunity.
 &HT;    Sergei Stepashin, Putin's predecessor, told me that he had urged
Putin to take a cautious approach by sealing the borders and taking
the northernmost, pro-Russian third of Chechnya, which is separated
from the rebellious part of the republic by the Terek River.
 &HT;    But Putin, backed by Russia's generals, who were looking to even
the score for their humiliating defeat in the 1994-'96 war in
Chechnya, opted for an all-out invasion, which culminated in bloody
street fighting in the Chechen capital.
 &HT;    ``I have some experience in taking Grozny,'' said Stepashin, who
had served as the head of the Federal Security Service, an heir to
the old KGB, during the first Chechen war. ``So I knew the
resistance would be fierce.''
 &HT;    The generals this time promised a ``special operation'' to
liberate Grozny, saying they would not storm the capital. But their
tactics displayed little finesse. The Russians leveled blocks of
apartment buildings, as if Grozny were not a city containing
thousands of Russia's own citizens. The generals decided to make
war this way, and soldiers like Vyacheslav Kiselyov were sent to
fight it.
 &HT;    ``The soldiers I had were too young,'' Vyacheslav said. ``They
were just 18 years old. I had a sniper in my unit. He leaned out of
a window for 10 seconds and a Chechen grenadier blew his head off.
Only the lower jaw and ears were left.''
 &HT;    Conscription was a holdover from Soviet times, and during the
1996 presidential election campaign Yeltsin promised to do away
with it altogether. But as with most of Yeltsin's plans, the one to
create an all-volunteer force foundered for lack of funds. And
these days more than 90 percent of the privates and noncommissioned
officers in the Russian army are conscripts.
 &HT;    The Moscow establishment, which has hailed Putin's war and which
is trying to ride his coattails, beat the system. It shielded its
own sons with student deferments.
 &HT;    But others, such as Viktor Zlodeyev, 19, didn't even think about
trying to find a way out. The product of a flawed conscript system
that sent ill-prepared young men to war and paid them virtually
nothing for their trouble, he was precisely the kind of soldier
Vyacheslav Kiselyov worried about.
 &HT;    Wounded in Grozny, Viktor, who was also in Room No. 8, told me
he was from the southern Russian city of Krasnodar, where his
father works as a truck driver and his mother serves as an
administrator in a nursery school. He completed nine years of
schooling and then transferred to a trade school to learn how to be
a bricklayer. The army grabbed him before he found a job.
 &HT;    ``My mother did not want me to go into the army,'' he said with
a shrug. ``She said, 'Why do we need all that?' But she said I
should go if I had to, and I never thought about faking a health
problem. After they took me I told the army I did not care what
kind of unit I was in but wanted to serve in Krasnodar, where my
parents live.''
 &HT;    Instead, the army sent him to Chechnya in October. To comfort
his parents, he did not tell them he was in Chechnya. When Viktor
writes his parents he tells them that he is with his brigade in
Budyonnovsk, a town in southern Russia.
 &HT;    Young conscripts told me their base pay was about 40 rubles
($1.40) a month before they arrived at the Mozdok base. Once there,
the pay was boosted to 400 rubles ($14) a month. Indeed, one of my
enduring impressions of the Russian army is that it seems to be
manned by a legion of beggars _ troops without the money to buy
decent cigarettes, which they are forced to bum from visitors.
 &HT;    As part of the orchestrated patriotism of the Chechen campaign,
local governments throughout Russia sent ``humanitarian aid'' to
the troops: candy, canned food and the like. But the officers took
it all, the soldiers told me. Even the officers are not above
asking for favors.
 &HT;    Despite his inexperience, Viktor was given one of the toughest
jobs. He was made a scout in the 205th Reconnaissance Battalion.
His first duty in Chechnya was on the Tersky Ridge. He did not fire
a shot, however, until just before New Year's Day, when he was sent
to Grozny. He was shocked by what he saw.
 &HT;    ``I experienced real fear when I saw the 200's for the first
time,'' he said, referring in Russian army-speak to the corpses of
fallen soldiers. ``They had lain there for a week before we came
in, and we had to bring them out. Some were lying on the street.
Some were in a burned-out armored personnel carrier.''
 &HT;    The ``200's'' is army shorthand for the Russian dead, and some
say it is derived from the fact that a zinc coffin and the wood
crate in which it is shipped together weigh 200 kilos.
 &HT;    A battered old bus used to travel from Grozny to Mozdok carrying
dead Interior Ministry troops. To expedite its passage through the
numerous checkpoints a small sign was placed inside the windshield:
``Cargo 200.''
 &HT;    One and all, the soldiers gave it a wide berth.

 &HT;    Snipers took their toll. And though Ivantsov did not say it, so
did Russian ``friendly fire'' from artillery and air strikes.
 &HT;    The generals like to boast about their ``precision strikes.'' In
the time I was in Chechnya, I never heard a general admit to a
single instance of friendly fire. The soldiers often talked about
it, however, with the same resignation that they spoke of the
frigid weather.
 &HT;    The assault on Grozny was carried out by a hodgepodge of units
with somewhat convoluted command relations: Interior Ministry
troops, the Russian army, militia from Russian cities,
rapid-reaction teams and pro-Russian Chechens. The Russian troops
in Grozny said the pro-Russian Chechens followed behind during the
assault on the capital.
 &HT;    The Mozdok hospital offered terrible evidence of the Russian
army's fighting in Chechnya. Noncommissioned officers,
inexperienced conscripts and ``kontraktniki'' _ generally older
mercenaries who sign six-month to one-year contracts and fight for
pay, a totally unknown category in the old Soviet army _ all were
represented in the Mozdok hospital.
 &HT;    When I visited, Room No. 8, which also doubles as a ward, had
about 20 double-decker bunks pressed together.
 &HT;    Vyacheslav told me he was born in the Amur region of eastern
Siberia, a stunning swath of coniferous forests, rivers and dormant
volcanoes, and wanted to be a forester when he grew up. ``I used to
pick up my rifle and go to the taiga every weekend to hunt,'' he
said. ``I'd go after small game like wolverine, or if I went with
some of my relatives we might go after bear.''
 &HT;    But he is also a young man from the old school _ that is, part
of that shrinking sliver of Russian society that still aspires to
join the military, a faint echo of the old Soviet patriotism. He
found that the soldier's life was not so bad at first. The troops
fed on kasha and tins of meat. Mail arrived once a week. There was
only one radio for the soldiers of his unit, but it was enough to
allow them to follow the news, which was not particularly grim.
There was fighting, but it was limited, and the Russians soon had
things under control.
 &HT;    It might have all ended in Dagestan for Vyacheslav had not
President Boris Yeltsin installed Putin as Russia's prime minister.
Putin, a former KGB officer determined to make his mark as a
Russian strongman, saw Chechnya not as a quagmire, but as an
opportunity.
 &HT;    Sergei Stepashin, Putin's predecessor, told me that he had urged
Putin to take a cautious approach by sealing the borders and taking
the northernmost, pro-Russian third of Chechnya, which is separated
from the rebellious part of the republic by the Terek River.
 &HT;    But Putin, backed by Russia's generals, who were looking to even
the score for their humiliating defeat in the 1994-'96 war in
Chechnya, opted for an all-out invasion, which culminated in bloody
street fighting in the Chechen capital.
 &HT;    ``I have some experience in taking Grozny,'' said Stepashin, who
had served as the head of the Federal Security Service, an heir to
the old KGB, during the first Chechen war. ``So I knew the
resistance would be fierce.''
 &HT;    The generals this time promised a ``special operation'' to
liberate Grozny, saying they would not storm the capital. But their
tactics displayed little finesse. The Russians leveled blocks of
apartment buildings, as if Grozny were not a city containing
thousands of Russia's own citizens. The generals decided to make
war this way, and soldiers like Vyacheslav Kiselyov were sent to
fight it.
 &HT;    ``The soldiers I had were too young,'' Vyacheslav said. ``They
were just 18 years old. I had a sniper in my unit. He leaned out of
a window for 10 seconds and a Chechen grenadier blew his head off.
Only the lower jaw and ears were left.''
 &HT;    Conscription was a holdover from Soviet times, and during the
1996 presidential election campaign Yeltsin promised to do away
with it altogether. But as with most of Yeltsin's plans, the one to
create an all-volunteer force foundered for lack of funds. And
these days more than 90 percent of the privates and noncommissioned
officers in the Russian army are conscripts.
 &HT;    The Moscow establishment, which has hailed Putin's war and which
is trying to ride his coattails, beat the system. It shielded its
own sons with student deferments.
 &HT;    But others, such as Viktor Zlodeyev, 19, didn't even think about
trying to find a way out. The product of a flawed conscript system
that sent ill-prepared young men to war and paid them virtually
nothing for their trouble, he was precisely the kind of soldier
Vyacheslav Kiselyov worried about.
 &HT;    Wounded in Grozny, Viktor, who was also in Room No. 8, told me
he was from the southern Russian city of Krasnodar, where his
father works as a truck driver and his mother serves as an
administrator in a nursery school. He completed nine years of
schooling and then transferred to a trade school to learn how to be
a bricklayer. The army grabbed him before he found a job.
 &HT;    ``My mother did not want me to go into the army,'' he said with
a shrug. ``She said, 'Why do we need all that?' But she said I
should go if I had to, and I never thought about faking a health
problem. After they took me I told the army I did not care what
kind of unit I was in but wanted to serve in Krasnodar, where my
parents live.''
 &HT;    Instead, the army sent him to Chechnya in October. To comfort
his parents, he did not tell them he was in Chechnya. When Viktor
writes his parents he tells them that he is with his brigade in
Budyonnovsk, a town in southern Russia.
 &HT;    Young conscripts told me their base pay was about 40 rubles
($1.40) a month before they arrived at the Mozdok base. Once there,
the pay was boosted to 400 rubles ($14) a month. Indeed, one of my
enduring impressions of the Russian army is that it seems to be
manned by a legion of beggars _ troops without the money to buy
decent cigarettes, which they are forced to bum from visitors.
 &HT;    As part of the orchestrated patriotism of the Chechen campaign,
local governments throughout Russia sent ``humanitarian aid'' to
the troops: candy, canned food and the like. But the officers took
it all, the soldiers told me. Even the officers are not above
asking for favors.
 &HT;    Despite his inexperience, Viktor was given one of the toughest
jobs. He was made a scout in the 205th Reconnaissance Battalion.
His first duty in Chechnya was on the Tersky Ridge. He did not fire
a shot, however, until just before New Year's Day, when he was sent
to Grozny. He was shocked by what he saw.
 &HT;    ``I experienced real fear when I saw the 200's for the first
time,'' he said, referring in Russian army-speak to the corpses of
fallen soldiers. ``They had lain there for a week before we came
in, and we had to bring them out. Some were lying on the street.
Some were in a burned-out armored personnel carrier.''
 &HT;    The ``200's'' is army shorthand for the Russian dead, and some
say it is derived from the fact that a zinc coffin and the wood
crate in which it is shipped together weigh 200 kilos.
 &HT;    A battered old bus used to travel from Grozny to Mozdok carrying
dead Interior Ministry troops. To expedite its passage through the
numerous checkpoints a small sign was placed inside the windshield:
``Cargo 200.''
 &HT;    One and all, the soldiers gave it a wide berth.

fear my campaign, fellow Republican,'' he pleaded, ``join it, join

Republicans and that anyone who wants to be president must appeal
across party lines, George W. Bush responded with an appeal of his
own, calling on ``Republicans and like-minded independents'' to
support him. Which candidate will capture the hearts _ and votes _

   Haider told allies he had grown tired of international

provoked fury abroad and mass demonstrations on the streets of

<P>
   But there is no danger of Haider, the most successful politician
in postwar Austria, disappearing. His retreat is likely to prove a

<P>
   Haider, who turned 50 last month, has never concealed his
ambition of becoming chancellor of Austria one day. Asked in an
interview Monday if he had given up that dream because of the odium
heaped upon him in recent weeks, Haider replied: ``Why? It's become
even more likely.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanishing from the rough and tumble of national politics for a
while serves this long-term strategy. A stint in government should
make the Freedom Party more respectable, but possibly at the risk
of its own popularity.
</P>
<P>
   None of the xenophobic election slogans are likely to become
reality, but a lot of difficult decisions will have to be taken as
the coalition tries to grapple with an overregulated economy.
Already the Freedom Party is dropping in the polls, and ministers
have started bickering among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Haider will sit out these troubled times in his provincial power
base, nurturing his political virginity, and awaiting the moment
when he can return to Vienna as savior.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, his grip on the party is assured. Haider took
over the then-fringe party with a voter base of five percent 13
years ago, and has turned it into the second biggest political
force in Austria. In elections last October, it gained 27 percent
of the votes.
</P>
<P>
   Without him, as everybody knows, the Freedom Party would sink
back into oblivion. Whatever his title, Haider remains the
undisputed leader. &QL;

   BERLIN _ The Austrian far-right leader Joerg Haider stunned
political friends and foes alike by announcing Monday that he
wanted to step down as leader of the Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
   Haider told allies he had grown tired of international
criticism, and would henceforth concentrate on his job as governor
of the southern province of Carinthia. He suggested that Susanne
Riess-Passer, vice-chancellor in the new government that has
provoked fury abroad and mass demonstrations on the streets of
Vienna, should succeed him.
</P>

   The Freedom Party executive met Monday night to discuss their
leader's latest flamboyant gesture, which took even them by

   VIRGINIA BEACH _ Senator John McCain dramatically turned up the
heat in the battle for the Republican presidential nomination
Monday, attacking the influential religious right as hypocrites in
a speech described as ``astounding'' and ``epoch-making.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a rapturous audience at the Frank W. Cox High School
in Virginia Beach, Va., on the eve of three crucial Republican
primaries, McCain threw down the gauntlet to his rival for the
party's presidential nomination, George W. Bush, and reiterated his
claim to the political legacy of Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends, I am a Reagan Republican who will defeat Al
Gore,'' he said to deafening applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately'' _ he went on, as the audience rose to its feet
_ ``Governor Bush is a Pat Robertson Republican who will lose to Al
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, the leader of the Christian Coalition, allied himself
with Bush at the start of the presidential campaign and has made
recorded phone calls to voters in several key primary states,
casting doubts on McCain's conservative credentials. Virginia Beach
is Robertson's base of operations.
</P>
<P>
   In words that sounded not just like a bid for his party's
nomination, but like a bid for the presidency, McCain said
``neither party should be defined by pandering to the outer reaches
of American politics and the agents of intolerance, whether they be
Louis Farrakhan or Al Sharpton (black activists) on the left or Pat
Robertson or Jerry Falwell on the right.''
</P>
<P>
   (Falwell, a television evangelist, distinguished himself last
year by condemning the Tellytubbies toys for encouraging a gay
lifestyle because Tinky Winky carries a handbag.)
</P>
<P>
   McCain also set out to seize the high ground of Republican
conservatism from Bush, using the word ``conservative'' no fewer
than 16 times in his 15 minutes speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a pro-life, pro-family, fiscal conservative and advocate
of a strong defense,'' he said. ``And yet, Pat Robertson, Jerry
Falwell and a few Washington leaders of the pro-life movement call
me an unacceptable presidential candidate. They distort my pro-life
positions and smear the reputation of my supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican senator from Arizona was making his one and only
campaign speech in Virginia on the eve of today's (Tuesday's)
primary in the state, at the start of a day which would take him
across the United States from east to west via North Dakota and
Washington State and on to California.
</P>
<P>
   North Dakota and Washington hold caucuses and a primary today
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Until three weeks ago, Bush had been forecast to win an easy
victory in Virginia, a relatively conservative state, and McCain
had had no plans to campaign here.
</P>
<P>
   This changed after McCain's victory in Michigan last week, and
Monday's speech in Virginia Beach reflected a last-minute decision
to make one major campaign appearance in a state where polls show
the two men in a close race. &QL;

 By DAVID USBORNE  
 c.2000 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you know Madeleine Albright, you will also know
that the notion of her becoming the next president of the Czech
Republic is both absurd and utterly logical.
</P>
<P>
   You will also know that this is not the last you will hear about
it. She is a politician, after all, and she has been slipping from
the limelight of late.
</P>
<P>
   It is not as if the idea is new. They have been bouncing it
around the political parlors of Washington for over a year.
</P>
<P>
   Albright can never be president of the United States _ the
Constitution reserves tenancy of the White House to those born in
America _ so why not of somewhere else?
</P>
<P>
   Once during her tenure as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations,
during President Bill Clinton's first term, Albright joked that
there was a 16th member of the Security Council. She said it was
CNN.
</P>
<P>
   She understands the power of the media. She also knows how
important it is for her to court its attention. So let us gossip
about her moving to the presidential castle in Prague for awhile.
It will do her no harm.
</P>
<P>
   Prague is where she was born, on May 15, 1937. She was Madlenka
Korbelova, the daughter of a Czech diplomat Josef Korbel and his
wife, Mandula. She was barely out of diapers when Munich happened
and the rest of western Europe stood aside as Hitler invaded her
land. The family fled to London for the rest of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   When Germany was defeated, the Korbel clan returned to Prague
where Josef seemed on course to become his country's foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it was Stalin who got in the way and when Communism
conquered Czechoslovakia, Korbel took himself and his family to the
United States of America. It was 1948. He became a lecturer at the
University of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The ``refugee girl'' image has never harmed Albright's public
standing. Always gripped by politics and political history _
particularly the history of Eastern Europe _ she eventually became
a professor herself at Georgetown University in Washington.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you know Madeleine Albright, you will also know
that the notion of her becoming the next president of the Czech
Republic is both absurd and utterly logical.
</P>
<P>
   You will also know that this is not the last you will hear about
it. She is a politician, after all, and she has been slipping from
the limelight of late.
</P>
<P>
   It is not as if the idea is new. They have been bouncing it
around the political parlors of Washington for over a year.
</P>
<P>
   Albright can never be president of the United States _ the
Constitution reserves tenancy of the White House to those born in
America _ so why not of somewhere else?
</P>
<P>
   Once during her tenure as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations,
during President Bill Clinton's first term, Albright joked that
there was a 16th member of the Security Council. She said it was
CNN.
</P>
<P>
   She understands the power of the media. She also knows how
important it is for her to court its attention. So let us gossip
about her moving to the presidential castle in Prague for awhile.
It will do her no harm.
</P>
<P>
   Prague is where she was born, on May 15, 1937. She was Madlenka
Korbelova, the daughter of a Czech diplomat Josef Korbel and his
wife, Mandula. She was barely out of diapers when Munich happened
and the rest of western Europe stood aside as Hitler invaded her
land. The family fled to London for the rest of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   When Germany was defeated, the Korbel clan returned to Prague
where Josef seemed on course to become his country's foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it was Stalin who got in the way and when Communism
conquered Czechoslovakia, Korbel took himself and his family to the
United States of America. It was 1948. He became a lecturer at the
University of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The ``refugee girl'' image has never harmed Albright's public
standing. Always gripped by politics and political history _
particularly the history of Eastern Europe _ she eventually became
a professor herself at Georgetown University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   She also cultivated ties with the Democratic Party and many of
its leading figures. One of these was Bill Clinton, who gave her
the U.N. job, and brought her to Washington as secretary of state
in 1997. She is the first woman to hold such high office in the
United States. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrives
in Prague next week on a trip that many in the Czech capital see as
a declaration of interest in the country's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Czech-born Albright is being touted as a possible replacement
for Vaclav Havel, whose term of office ends in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   President Havel, a former dissident turned playwright, was the
leader of the 1989 Velvet Revolution that toppled the Communist
regime and has become the country's best-known ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from Havel, who retains immense admiration both at home
and abroad for his moral qualities, the perpetual squabbling and
infighting of most Czech politicians has left them in low esteem
with the public and there are no obvious successors to him.
</P>
<P>
   Havel told Albright a year and a half ago that he wanted her to
replace him, according to a report in Time magazine Monday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials denied that Albright, who speaks fluent Czech,
was interested in the post. She has been approached several times
by senior officials of her native land as a potential presidential
candidate, but has always refused, said her spokesman, James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has dismissed it, although she is certainly flattered that
that the Czechs would consider her for the post of president of her
native land. She has never given this serious consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   With three years of President Havel's term left to run, it's too
early to consider the U.S. secretary of state as a serious
presidential candidate, said Prague-based sociologist Ivan Gabal,
who has met her several times.
</P>
<P>
   Still there is nationwide goodwill towards Albright, both for
her Czech origins and because of her role in integrating the
central European nation into NATO. The Czech Republic, together
with Hungary and Poland, joined the alliance last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is definitely a serious person, but it's not on the agenda
yet. She is known here as the U.S. secretary of state, but not as
someone who would run for presidential office.
</P>
<P>
   ``But she is perceived positively here, as a sympathetic person
because she understands our position in central Europe and very
much helped bring us into NATO,'' said Gabal.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Zantovsky, former Czech ambassador to Washington, said
in Prague that he met last week with Havel and discussed, among
other things, the possibility that Albright might run to succeed
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never made it a secret that I think that Madeleine Albright
could, one day in the future, play a big role in Czech politics,''
Zantovsky said. He stressed that the idea is not new and that it
would not dominate Albright's agenda in the Czech Republic next
week.
</P>
<P>
   In Prague, Havel's chief-policy adviser, Pavel Fischer, told
Time magazine that the idea could be on the agenda: ``It is not
impossible that they will talk about this.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Czech constitution, the president needs to be a
Czech citizen. As Albright was born in the former Czechoslovakia,
to Czech parents, she would have to reclaim her citizenship, which
would be likely to be granted. &QL;

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair's fresh skepticism
about GM (genetically-modified) foods was bolstered Monday by
claims that the U.S. government has covered up the safety fears of
its own scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations will support public concerns, acknowledged by
Blair in an article for The Independent on Sunday over the weekend,
that GM foods are potentially harmful.
</P>
<P>
   Internal documents from Washington's food safety agency indicate
U.S. government scientists advised against the assumption that GM
crops are as safe as ones developed by traditional methods.
</P>
<P>
   The assumption of ``substantive equivalence,'' made by the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA), means GM foods face less stringent
testing than, for example, genetically-modified drugs.
</P>
<P>
   It has allowed the speedy commercialization of GM crops through
the U.S., with some products reaching the U.K. market without
further safety checks.
</P>
<P>
   One of the FDA scientists, Dr. Linda Kahl, said the agency was
trying to force the conclusion that the two seed-breeding methods
are equivalent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process of genetic engineering and traditional breeding
are different, and according to the technical experts in the
agency, they lead to different risks,'' she said in a memo.
</P>
<P>
   The documents with her comments, and those of other FDA
scientists, were disclosed during a lawsuit demanding tougher
testing, led by Steven Druker, a public-interest lawyer, who Monday
accused the FDA of ``shoddy'' safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   Druker is attending this week's conference in Edinburgh on GM
food safety sponsored by the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development.
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``The FDA's own scientists warned that genetic
modification may generate unexpected toxic carcinogens, allergens
and anti-nutritive substances in foods that were not being tested
for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet the agency covered that up and said it had no information
that GM foods differed in any way from other foods.''
</P>
<P>
   Druker's claims were rejected by the OECD. Patrick Kearns of the
OECD's health and safety department, said: ``Substantive
equivalence is part of a safety assessment. It is about a standard
of safety that means what we are looking for is a similar level of
safety to normal food.''
</P>
<P>
   But he refused to rule out the possibility that GM foods had
created new toxins and carcinogens which were potentially harmful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everything in the world is possible. We have to think
about what is reasonably possible and what is unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   Druker's concerns were backed by mainstream scientists within
the conference, which has brought together 400 GM experts with the
aim of reaching a consensus that can then advise a G7 summit of the
world's leading industrialized nations in Japan in July.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Mowlam, Britain's cabinet office minister, told the
conference she rejected claims that the prime minister had
performed a U-turn on GM safety. ``What we have always said is
there are potentially harmful effects,'' she said. &QL;

 c.2000 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just two hours after learning to his evident
amazement that his presidential ambitions were still alive, thanks
to the voters of straitlaced Michigan, Senator John McCain issued a
curious appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't fear my campaign, fellow Republicans,'' he pleaded,
``join it, join it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since that enchanted Tuesday evening, he has travelled the
length of the West Coast, from Seattle to San Diego, preparing for
the next set of primaries, this week and next, when the fate of his
self-styled crusade will once again be on the line. And those words
have resonated in his wake.
</P>
<P>
   To his opponent, the party establishment's favorite, George W.
Bush, they were a welcome cause for ridicule. What sort of a
Republican candidate is it that has to reach out to his fellow
Republicans?, he quipped at every campaign stop.
</P>
<P>
   His point was that John McCain had won the Michigan and New
Hampshire primaries courtesy of thousands of registered Democrats
and non-party voters who had crossed party lines to vote in a
Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   A good half of the voters in Michigan were not Republicans and
it was they who gave McCain his victory.
</P>
<P>
   A disconsolate Bush camp spent last week accusing him of
everything from ``borrowing'' Democrats to ``hijacking the
Republican primary.''
</P>
<P>
   However, mindful of the truth _ articulated on occasion by
McCain _ that only 40 percent of all U.S. voters are Republicans
and that anyone who wants to be president must appeal across party
lines, Bush formulated an appeal of his own, calling on
``Republicans and like-minded independents'' to support him.
</P>
<P>
   As the primaries progress, the Bush team calculates that the
threat from what McCain has termed ``the McCain majority'' will
fade. They look forward to the coming primaries where only
Republicans may vote.
</P>
<P>
   With the party hierarchy at national and local level still
firmly behind their candidate, they reckon that Bush will be home
and dry with the presidential nomination before the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   Accepted wisdom has it that if he is to prevent Bush taking the
nomination, McCain needs to capture the party mainstream.
Thereafter he can, and must, make broader alliances, but for now
his problem is winning over the rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   His proliferating references to the legacy of Ronald Reagan in
recent days suggest that he already has his sights on that
traditional, Republican constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Yet McCain's sweeping victory in the Arizona primary, which was
``closed'' to all but registered Republicans, suggests that where
he is well-known (Arizona is his home state) and where he is
running expressly against the local party establishment (the
governor and her administration backed Bush), the personal
supersedes the political.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, an analysis of McCain's support _ extrapolated
from exit polls in the states that have so far voted and augmented
by local apocrypha _ suggests he may not be so far removed from the
mainstream as the Bush camp likes to think, especially after Bush's
turn to the right to win South Carolina's primary .
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, those voters _ independent, Democrat and even
Republican _ who cast their ballot for McCain gave many reasons for
their choice.
</P>
<P>
   They included a desire to get back at the fervently pro-Bush
state governor over entirely local grievances, as well as an
aversion to being told by the governor how to vote, and dislike or
disapproval of Bush for his high birth and perceived shallowness.
</P>
<P>
   But the main reason people said they voted for McCain was the
same reason people gave in New Hampshire and elsewhere: because
they like him.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush camp has tried to use McCain's supposed unpopularity in
the Senate and in Arizona's political circles to argue that ``the
better people know Mr. McCain the less they like him.'' But the
impression from the campaign trail so far is quite the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   The more the voters see of McCain, the more his poll ratings
rise; conversely, the more they see of Bush, the less they like
him.
</P>
<P>
   His personal appeal is partly to do with his past as a Vietnam
war hero; but this would count for little without his authority on
the stump and the direct way he connects with his audiences, live
or on television.
</P>
<P>
   TV cameramen have described him as a ``dream,'' someone with
``no bad angles.'' Live, he galvanizes his audiences as none of the
other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   As he has become better known, both the gender and age gaps
among voters have also closed.
</P>
<P>
   Until Michigan, Bush _ who has allegedly adopted a specifically
female-friendly vocabulary _ took a majority of the women's vote.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, though, which is more of a microcosm of America
than any state that has voted so far, McCain took 53 percent of the
women's vote, compared with 41 percent for Bush. He led among male
voters, too.
</P>
<P>
   Young people are turning out for McCain in droves and their
comments are especially illuminating, given the perpetual
complaints of political commentators about the apathy of the
under-25s.
</P>
<P>
   This group finds McCain ``genuine,'' ``authentic'' and someone
worthy of their respect, who does not indulge in the double-speak
or image-switching they have grown used to from politicians.
</P>
<P>
   That they do not subscribe to all his policies, on abortion, for
instance, bothers them not a whit; they just think he would make a
good president. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just two hours after learning to his evident
amazement that his presidential ambitions were still alive, thanks
to the voters of straitlaced Michigan, Senator John McCain issued a
curious appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't fear my campaign, fellow Republicans,'' he pleaded,
``join it, join it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since that enchanted Tuesday evening, he has travelled the
length of the West Coast, from Seattle to San Diego, preparing for
the next set of primaries, this week and next, when the fate of his
self-styled crusade will once again be on the line. And those words
have resonated in his wake.
</P>
<P>
   To his opponent, the party establishment's favorite, George W.
Bush, they were a welcome cause for ridicule. What sort of a
Republican candidate is it that has to reach out to his fellow
Republicans?, he quipped at every campaign stop.
</P>
<P>
   His point was that John McCain had won the Michigan and New
Hampshire primaries courtesy of thousands of registered Democrats
and non-party voters who had crossed party lines to vote in a
Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   A good half of the voters in Michigan were not Republicans and
it was they who gave McCain his victory.
</P>
<P>
   A disconsolate Bush camp spent last week accusing him of
everything from ``borrowing'' Democrats to ``hijacking the
Republican primary.''
</P>
<P>
   However, mindful of the truth _ articulated on occasion by
McCain _ that only 40 percent of all U.S. voters are Republicans
and that anyone who wants to be president must appeal across party
lines, Bush formulated an appeal of his own, calling on
``Republicans and like-minded independents'' to support him.
</P>
<P>
   As the primaries progress, the Bush team calculates that the
threat from what McCain has termed ``the McCain majority'' will
fade. They look forward to the coming primaries where only
Republicans may vote.
</P>
<P>
   With the party hierarchy at national and local level still
firmly behind their candidate, they reckon that Bush will be home
and dry with the presidential nomination before the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   Accepted wisdom has it that if he is to prevent Bush taking the
nomination, McCain needs to capture the party mainstream.
Thereafter he can, and must, make broader alliances, but for now
his problem is winning over the rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   His proliferating references to the legacy of Ronald Reagan in
recent days suggest that he already has his sights on that
traditional, Republican constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Yet McCain's sweeping victory in the Arizona primary, which was
``closed'' to all but registered Republicans, suggests that where
he is well-known (Arizona is his home state) and where he is
running expressly against the local party establishment (the
governor and her administration backed Bush), the personal
supersedes the political.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, an analysis of McCain's support _ extrapolated
from exit polls in the states that have so far voted and augmented
by local apocrypha _ suggests he may not be so far removed from the
mainstream as the Bush camp likes to think, especially after Bush's
turn to the right to win South Carolina's primary .
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, those voters _ independent, Democrat and even
Republican _ who cast their ballot for McCain gave many reasons for
their choice.
</P>
<P>
   They included a desire to get back at the fervently pro-Bush
state governor over entirely local grievances, as well as an
aversion to being told by the governor how to vote, and dislike or
disapproval of Bush for his high birth and perceived shallowness.
</P>
<P>
   But the main reason people said they voted for McCain was the
same reason people gave in New Hampshire and elsewhere: because
they like him.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush camp has tried to use McCain's supposed unpopularity in
the Senate and in Arizona's political circles to argue that ``the
better people know Mr. McCain the less they like him.'' But the
impression from the campaign trail so far is quite the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   The more the voters see of McCain, the more his poll ratings
rise; conversely, the more they see of Bush, the less they like
him.
</P>
<P>
   His personal appeal is partly to do with his past as a Vietnam
war hero; but this would count for little without his authority on
the stump and the direct way he connects with his audiences, live
or on television.
</P>
<P>
   TV cameramen have described him as a ``dream,'' someone with
``no bad angles.'' Live, he galvanizes his audiences as none of the
other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   As he has become better known, both the gender and age gaps
among voters have also closed.
</P>
<P>
   Until Michigan, Bush _ who has allegedly adopted a specifically
female-friendly vocabulary _ took a majority of the women's vote.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, though, which is more of a microcosm of America
than any state that has voted so far, McCain took 53 percent of the
women's vote, compared with 41 percent for Bush. He led among male

</P>
<P>
   Young people are turning out for McCain in droves and their
comments are especially illuminating, given the perpetual
complaints of political commentators about the apathy of the
under-25s.
</P>
<P>
   This group finds McCain ``genuine,'' ``authentic'' and someone
worthy of their respect, who does not indulge in the double-speak
or image-switching they have grown used to from politicians.
</P>
<P>
   That they do not subscribe to all his policies, on abortion, for
instance, bothers them not a whit; they just think he would make a
good president. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   TBLISI, GEORGIA _ In the snow-covered mountains of northern
Georgia soldiers can hear the roar of battle across the border in
Chechnya creeping gradually towards them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are worried that the Russians will push the Chechen
fighters into Georgia,'' said a Georgian official in Tblisi, the
Georgian capital.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, the fragile republic of five million people on the
southern slopes of the Caucasus Mountains, is trying hard to keep
out of the Chechen war.
</P>
<P>
   It has strenuously denied Russian claims that Chechen guerrillas
regularly cross its 50-mile-long border with Chechnya, bringing in
supplies and reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
   A weary-looking Georgian President Edouard Shevardnadze told The
Independent Saturday ``we are doing everything we can to avoid
getting involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Shevardnadze said that it was Russia's responsibility to police
the border on the Chechen side and it had the troops in place to do
so. But, in some of the worst terrain in the world, it is unlikely
that the Russian army can stop guerrilla detachments escaping into
Georgia, already home to 5,000 Chechen refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all the ingredients for a Palestinian-type situation
here in which Chechen guerrillas would base themselves among the
refugees in Georgia and make raids across the border into
Chechnya,'' said an international official Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Cook, the British Foreign Secretary, was at pains
Saturday, during his visit to Georgia, to reassure Shevardnadze
that the outside world is committed to preventing the spread of
instability in the Caucasus and protecting the independence and
integrity of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   He said an expanded force of monitors from the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) would provide ``eyes on
the ground'' along the Georgian-Chechen border.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be enough. Georgia is not a country which can take
much pressure. It is already impoverished by having to feed 300,000
Georgian refugees driven out of the breakaway region of Abkhazia,
whose secession was covertly backed by Russia, in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the Chechen war last year Georgia vehemently
rejected a Russian demand to station border guards on the Georgian
side of the Chechen border.
</P>
<P>
   Russian aircraft later accidentally bombed a Georgian village.
Moscow threatened to make the large Georgian diaspora in Russia
apply for visas.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis in relations was partly defused when Shevardnadze met
Vladimir Putin, the acting Russian president, in January.
</P>
<P>
   Georgian officials said that Shevardnadze was able to convince
Putin that claims by Russian military intelligence that Georgia was
a staging area for Chechen rebels were inflated. Putin spoke of
Georgia as being ``a friendly state.''
</P>
<P>
   The goodwill may not last. Putin spoke Saturday in St.
Petersburg of opening talks with the Chechens, but only when the
rebels have been defeated.
</P>
<P>
   In effect Russia is not prepared to negotiate with any Chechen
leader with any credibility among his own people. This is a recipe
for a long war whose effects will almost certainly spill over into
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   For Shevardnadze it is a delicate balancing game. Because of the
war Russia needs Georgia's cooperation more than ever before. It
may try to gain this through fostering closer links with Tblisi.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time it can put pressure on Georgia through its
influence on secessionist movements and its position as supplier of
most of Georgia's electricity and gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Georgia fears the sound of Russian guns across its
northern border. &QL;

   &UR; SEATTLE: AMERICA'S `SPOILED RICH KID' GETS A REALITY CHECK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the weirdest state I ever saw,'' says a Seattle man
who has lived in Washington state for 23 years after spending time
in Chicago, New York and California. ``Washington has cheap
electricity, no real social problems, companies like Microsoft,
Boeing, Starbucks and Nordstrom, a mild climate _ it's the spoiled
rich kid of the nation.'' Yes, but even for a rich kid life has
problems (ask George W. Bush). This is beginning to dawn on
Washington, and particularly on the state's largest city, Seattle.

as a whole, he is more of a healer than a divider. Ever since
Saigon fell to the Communists in 1975, the U.S. has been suffering
from post-Vietnam stress disorder. McCain is a vital part of the
country's struggle to put the disorder behind it. &QL;

   Although Valley girls and Valley-speak remain the target of
comedians, the San Fernando Valley in Southern California is about
to be taken a bit more seriously. A secessionist movement is
underfoot to break the San Fernando Valley, which lies to the north
of the Santa Monica Mountains, away from the larger portion of Los
Angeles that lies to its south, creating two cities out of the one
that exists today. &QL;

<P>
   Mexico's long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)
knows all about the power of cinema. For 30 years until the 1960s,
the country's film industry, like the PRI itself, enjoyed a golden
age. It dominated Latin American screens, with stirring but
politically soothing tales of love, treachery and Mexican cowboys.
The memory of the medium's power still lingers, it seems. How else
to explain the PRI's clumsy attempt to censor ``Herod's Law,'' a
movie that casts a piercing gaze at that bygone period? &QL;

   For now, the biggest tug of wills over Kosovo's future is
unfolding in the muddy, foggy streets of Mitrovica, where the Ibar
River has become a virtual dividing line between Serbs in the
northern fifth of Kosovo and ethnic Albanians to the south. How
firm that division becomes, and how many families survive on the
``wrong'' side of the line, will be a tough and telling test for
both the U.N. and NATO, which is rushing to boost the size of its
force from the current level of 30,000 to meet the challenge. &QL;

   Ever the enigmatic oracle, Mao Zedong once said that it might
take China 100 years to bring Taiwan back into the fold of a
reunified motherland. On Feb. 21, China suddenly stepped up the
pressure, threatening to resort to ``all drastic measures possible,
including the use of force'' if Taiwan were to refuse
``indefinitely'' to negotiate with the mainland on reunification.
The timing is not coincidental. On March 18, Taiwan is due to hold
an election to find a replacement for President Lee Teng-hui. &QL;

   TBLISI, GEORGIA _ In the snow-covered mountains of northern
Georgia soldiers can hear the roar of battle across the border in
Chechnya creeping gradually towards them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are worried that the Russians will push the Chechen
fighters into Georgia,'' said a Georgian official in Tblisi, the
Georgian capital.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, the fragile republic of five million people on the
southern slopes of the Caucasus Mountains, is trying hard to keep
out of the Chechen war.
</P>
<P>
   It has strenuously denied Russian claims that Chechen guerrillas
regularly cross its 50-mile-long border with Chechnya, bringing in
supplies and reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
   A weary-looking Georgian President Edouard Shevardnadze told The
Independent Saturday ``we are doing everything we can to avoid
getting involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Shevardnadze said that it was Russia's responsibility to police
the border on the Chechen side and it had the troops in place to do
so. But, in some of the worst terrain in the world, it is unlikely
that the Russian army can stop guerrilla detachments escaping into
Georgia, already home to 5,000 Chechen refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all the ingredients for a Palestinian-type situation
here in which Chechen guerrillas would base themselves among the
refugees in Georgia and make raids across the border into
Chechnya,'' said an international official Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Cook, the British Foreign Secretary, was at pains
Saturday, during his visit to Georgia, to reassure Shevardnadze
that the outside world is committed to preventing the spread of
instability in the Caucasus and protecting the independence and
integrity of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   He said an expanded force of monitors from the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) would provide ``eyes on
the ground'' along the Georgian-Chechen border.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be enough. Georgia is not a country which can take
much pressure. It is already impoverished by having to feed 300,000
Georgian refugees driven out of the breakaway region of Abkhazia,
whose secession was covertly backed by Russia, in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the Chechen war last year Georgia vehemently
rejected a Russian demand to station border guards on the Georgian
side of the Chechen border.
</P>
<P>
   Russian aircraft later accidentally bombed a Georgian village.
Moscow threatened to make the large Georgian diaspora in Russia
apply for visas.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis in relations was partly defused when Shevardnadze met
Vladimir Putin, the acting Russian president, in January.
</P>
<P>
   Georgian officials said that Shevardnadze was able to convince
Putin that claims by Russian military intelligence that Georgia was
a staging area for Chechen rebels were inflated. Putin spoke of
Georgia as being ``a friendly state.''
</P>
<P>
   The goodwill may not last. Putin spoke Saturday in St.
Petersburg of opening talks with the Chechens, but only when the
rebels have been defeated.
</P>
<P>
   In effect Russia is not prepared to negotiate with any Chechen
leader with any credibility among his own people. This is a recipe
for a long war whose effects will almost certainly spill over into
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   For Shevardnadze it is a delicate balancing game. Because of the
war Russia needs Georgia's cooperation more than ever before. It
may try to gain this through fostering closer links with Tblisi.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time it can put pressure on Georgia through its
influence on secessionist movements and its position as supplier of
most of Georgia's electricity and gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Georgia fears the sound of Russian guns across its
northern border. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   This week the Republican Party took one great step forward and
one huge step back in its quest to recapture the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The step forward was to capture the imagination of the American
electorate. Voters of all parties are flocking to the Republican
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, Senator John McCain had been expected to pick
up momentum from his win in New Hampshire. Instead he was trounced
by George W. Bush. Three days later, Michigan seemed certain to
dispatch McCain; yet he won by seven percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican race, now heading towards a showdown in New York
and California on March 7, is the most exciting since Gerald Ford
and Ronald Reagan battled it out in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also that backwards step to consider. To win in
South Carolina, Bush ``turned negative'' with a ferocity that few
expected. McCain's response has been only a little more
gentlemanly.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the squabbling party seems to be splitting in a way that
could spell disaster in the general election in November.
</P>
<P>
   With McCain picking up the votes of independents, Bush has been
dragged to the right. Conservative posturing, such as making a
speech at a South Carolinian university that forbids interracial
dating, may help the Texan win the nomination, because the next
primaries are nearly all ones in which only registered Republicans
can vote.
</P>
<P>
   But such shenanigans could put off the independent voters that
the nominee will desperately need in November. This helps explain
why, even as the Republican race grips the attention, much of the
(supposedly) smart money in Washington is shifting towards Al Gore,
the likely Democratic candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is even the suspicion that minority politics might
actually suit some hard-core Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Held hostage by special interests and the religious right,
outmaneuvered by President Bill Clinton at every turn, their only
remaining clarion-call has been to propose cutting taxes far more
than the electorate wants. Such tactics lead towards a political
ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   From now on, Bush and McCain must seek to avoid that fate.
McCain's chance of doing so looks the better one. His candidacy
should anyway have two big attractions for all but the most
narrow-minded members of his own party.
</P>
<P>
   First, he is a true-blue conservative. How an anti-abortion,
pro-deregulation, pro-gun war hero could ever be deemed
unacceptably liberal remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Second, he stands for moral leadership which, combined with his
passion for campaign-finance reform, could skewer the
ethically-challenged Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, one sad fact of the Republican Party's recent history
is that it often takes an outsider to reform it _ and make it
electable. Ronald Reagan and Dwight Eisenhower were such creatures;
McCain could be another.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is still the party's front-runner, and still stands a fair
chance in November. Yet he risks finding himself trapped by the
relentlessly rightward path he has adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Independents make up 15 percent of the electorate; every
conservative fusillade from Bush's lackeys against McCain sends the
independents shuttling towards Gore.
</P>
<P>
   He could, nevertheless, redefine himself once again. After all,
the Bush family has a habit of running dirtily but governing
cleanly (President Bush, now revered as a statesman, used the
infamous Willie Horton advertisement against Michael Dukakis).
</P>
<P>
   And, if nothing else, Bush, who in New Hampshire gave the
impression that electioneering bored him, has shown that he really
wants the job. Indeed, in his desperate transformation, he has
mimicked that other dynastic scion, Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The vice-president's campaign against Bill Bradley has also been
mucky and disingenuous. And Gore has been dragged to the left on
issues such as trade and gays in the armed services.
</P>
<P>
   Come November, Gore could also be painted as an extremist _
provided, of course, that Bush can inch a bit closer to the center.
That is not impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's political credo has been somewhat traduced by the
campaign. By most standards, his record is reassuringly moderate.
On issues such as trade and immigration, he has stood out against
the nastier isolationist tendency in his party.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine that a man who speaks fluent Spanish and
has a Latina sister-in-law really stands for white racist values,
as he has sometimes seemed to suggest.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, his achievements in education are real enough. And he
can point to a decent record of constructive cooperation with
Democrats. Remember, it was this moderate, inclusionist, optimistic
George W. Bush who once led Gore in the polls by 19 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Republicans' choice should have little to do with
being fair to either candidate. The point of this exercise is to
choose the man most likely to beat Gore in November.
</P>
<P>
   On that measure, the choice should surely be John McCain. Of the
two, he has demonstrated the clearest ability to appeal to
independent and Democratic voters, which will be crucial in turning
a party victory into a presidential one.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he is most clearly the man for the post-Clinton
moment, the anti-Gore: clean, heroic, straight-talking, likely to
stand up strongly for democracy's interests around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The Economist disapproves of his positions on guns and abortion,
and of his anti-tobacco stance. But if we had a vote, then on the
evidence so far it would go to Senator McCain. &QL;

remaining clarion-call has been to propose cutting taxes far more
than the electorate wants. Such tactics lead towards a political
ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   From now on, Bush and McCain must seek to avoid that fate.
McCain's chance of doing so looks the better one. His candidacy
should anyway have two big attractions for all but the most
narrow-minded members of his own party.
</P>
<P>
   First, he is a true-blue conservative. How an anti-abortion,
pro-deregulation, pro-gun war hero could ever be deemed
unacceptably liberal remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Second, he stands for moral leadership which, combined with his
passion for campaign-finance reform, could skewer the
ethically-challenged Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, one sad fact of the Republican Party's recent history
is that it often takes an outsider to reform it _ and make it
electable. Ronald Reagan and Dwight Eisenhower were such creatures;
McCain could be another.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is still the party's front-runner, and still stands a fair
chance in November. Yet he risks finding himself trapped by the
relentlessly rightward path he has adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Independents make up 15 percent of the electorate; every
conservative fusillade from Bush's lackeys against McCain sends the
independents shuttling towards Gore.
</P>
<P>
   He could, nevertheless, redefine himself once again. After all,
the Bush family has a habit of running dirtily but governing
cleanly (President Bush, now revered as a statesman, used the
infamous Willie Horton advertisement against Michael Dukakis).
</P>
<P>
   And, if nothing else, Bush, who in New Hampshire gave the
impression that electioneering bored him, has shown that he really
wants the job. Indeed, in his desperate transformation, he has
mimicked that other dynastic scion, Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The vice-president's campaign against Bill Bradley has also been
mucky and disingenuous. And Gore has been dragged to the left on
issues such as trade and gays in the armed services.
</P>
<P>
   Come November, Gore could also be painted as an extremist _
provided, of course, that Bush can inch a bit closer to the center.
That is not impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's political credo has been somewhat traduced by the
campaign. By most standards, his record is reassuringly moderate.
On issues such as trade and immigration, he has stood out against
the nastier isolationist tendency in his party.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine that a man who speaks fluent Spanish and
has a Latina sister-in-law really stands for white racist values,
as he has sometimes seemed to suggest.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, his achievements in education are real enough. And he
can point to a decent record of constructive cooperation with
Democrats. Remember, it was this moderate, inclusionist, optimistic
George W. Bush who once led Gore in the polls by 19 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Republicans' choice should have little to do with
being fair to either candidate. The point of this exercise is to
choose the man most likely to beat Gore in November.
</P>
<P>
   On that measure, the choice should surely be John McCain. Of the
two, he has demonstrated the clearest ability to appeal to
independent and Democratic voters, which will be crucial in turning
a party victory into a presidential one.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he is most clearly the man for the post-Clinton
moment, the anti-Gore: clean, heroic, straight-talking, likely to
stand up strongly for democracy's interests around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The Economist disapproves of his positions on guns and abortion,
and of his anti-tobacco stance. But if we had a vote, then on the
evidence so far it would go to Senator McCain. &QL;

<P>
   ``An event of historic proportions,'' was the Clinton
administration's judgment on the reformists' victory in Iran's
parliamentary election last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Can the United States now build on this historic, but still
fragile, event by improving its own bad relations with the Islamic
republic? It would be the waste of a chance if it failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past couple of years, the Americans have made tentative
efforts to start a political dialogue with the Iranian government.
These have been spurned.
</P>
<P>
   President Muhammad Khatami has welcomed people-to-people talk,
but has not felt strong enough, in the face of the hostility of his
implacably Great-Satan-hating adversaries, to extend this welcome
to official negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Now Khatami and his supporters are on a roll, able to override
crude sniping. A resumption of relations would please most
Iranians.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the reformers' attitude towards the United States
remains defiant. The door is open, they say, but it is up to
America to walk through it, carrying gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Although the years in which the United States tried to
``contain'' Iran are long gone, American laws or rules prohibit
virtually all commercial transactions between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   However, since the ban on investment in, and trade with, Iran
dates from a 1995 executive order, Clinton can, if he so decides,
modify it without congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   American oilmen, frustrated as their competitors grab contracts
with Iran, are hungry for an easing of the regulations. For their
part, the Iranians would be happy if they were allowed to export,
say, their carpets or caviar to America.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important to Iran would be a U-turn in America's
determination to block it from any Caspian pipeline deal: Iran
aspires, not unreasonably, to be one of the principal corridors
bringing Caspian oil and gas to market.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is also insistent that America should show some give on
what it calls its ``frozen assets.'' The shah ordered, and paid
for, American military goods and services which, after the 1979
revolution, were not delivered. The dispute is before the
American-Iranian claims tribunal in The Hague, an arbitration body
set up in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of the claims have been settled, Iran is still
trying to claim amounts that go into billions of dollars. It would
be good to tie up all this business, maybe with a unilateral
American offer of a lump sum, even if that involved congressional
approval.
</P>
<P>
   If America were to tempt Iran to negotiation with juicy tidbits,
what should Iran offer in return?
</P>
<P>
   Some years ago, Iran stopped slinging money around the world to
terrorist groups. It still supports Lebanon's Hezbollah guerrillas
and will continue to do so as long as Israel occupies south
Lebanon. But it could commit itself to stop, once Israel has left
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Iran could also commit itself to supporting Yasser Arafat in the
Palestinian-Israeli peace process, thus taking the vitriol, and
much of the danger, out of its traditional anti-Israeli stance.
</P>
<P>
   All this is important. But a main reason behind America's
sanctions is to deny Iran the money that it might otherwise spend
on weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, once the victim of Iraqi aggression, lives in a rough
neighborhood, surrounded by people who not only have ballistic
missiles but also nuclear capacity (Russia, India, Pakistan,
American forces in the Gulf).
</P>
<P>
   It has signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, but remains
suspect. It is bound to look to its own security. But it would
lessen suspicion if it subscribed to the newly tightened nuclear
safeguards _ which would cost it nothing if, as it claims, it has
no military nuclear ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is on the cusp of reformation. There are still powerful
forces bent on keeping it in the darkness of petty rules and a
harsh clerical judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Its reforming leaders, rejecting any hint of patronage, still
feel they have to move with great caution in their dealings with
the United States. But the election gives America an unusual
opportunity to help the reformists and further its own strategic
interests. It should seize it. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it a fleeting fancy, or a life-changing love? The question
lingers over today's obsession with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   On one side, electronic commerce is exploding, and the stock
markets' dot.com mania seems to be migrating from America to Europe
and Japan, and even to emerging economies.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, delivery snarl-ups have besmirched the
reputation of electronic retailers, and profits from doing business
on the World Wide Web are largely nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   What is one to conclude? Let's sift through the sense and
nonsense surrounding the business-to-consumer e-boom.
</P>
<P>
   There is much hype, but there is also a solid base in reality.
And this suggests that the second answer to the lingering question
is closer to the mark.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is profoundly affecting almost all business and
commerce. A common slogan is true: any big firm that fails to
grapple with the consequences is putting its future at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers tell only part of the story. In 1999 global e-commerce
was worth a little over $150 billion. Around 80 percent of those
transactions were between one business and another.
</P>
<P>
   Yet growth of all forms of e-commerce is hectic.
Business-to-business Web exchanges are mushrooming. In America
e-retailing revenues tripled last year; in Europe and Japan they
rose faster still.
</P>
<P>
   The absolute level of consumer e-commerce is still small, at
around 1 percent of American retail sales. But in some areas its
share is far higher: 15 percent of retail stockbroking and 5
percent of book sales, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   The influence of the Internet stretches farther than such
figures suggest. It is used more as a source of information than as
a place to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys in America suggest that last year, when less than 3
percent of new car sales were made over the Web, 40 percent
involved it at some stage, usually for price comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   And e-commerce often needs to take only a small share of the pie
to have a big impact on what is left. Travel agents' margins are so
flimsy that a loss of 3 percent of their market to the Web would be
enough to push many out of business.
</P>
<P>
   One impact is thus to intensify competition, producing benefits
to consumers in lower prices and more choice, at the expense of
producers and intermediaries. But a more profound effect is a
wholesale restructuring of businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the rise of e-commerce, such giant firms as General
Motors, Ford and, this week, Unilever, are embracing the Internet
for many of their activities. And the giants' move means that their
suppliers, as well as intermediaries through whom they sell, must
take to the Internet too.
</P>
<P>
   The promised land that this ripple effect holds out is one of
more transparency, greater efficiency and, yes, higher
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Hard macroeconomic evidence of these things is admittedly still
elusive. But it is at least conceivable that new technology and the
Internet may be partly responsible for America's unexpectedly
strong recent productivity growth, as well as its surprisingly low
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   So is the Internet leading to economic nirvana _ and does
dot.com mania make sense? Not quite.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet may be transforming business; but it is not
rewriting economics to enable the American economy to expand at its
current rate without dangerously overheating. Nor does the
explosion of e-commerce justify the current high prices of many
Internet-related shares.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, all the signs are that the markets remain in
the grip of a technology-related bubble. Many equity markets
currently look overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   But Internet shares are causing particular concern, for two
reasons. One is simply that their overvaluation looks so huge.
</P>
<P>
   Because few make profits, normal earnings-related measures
cannot be used. But even enthusiasts concede that as many as 80
percent of today's Internet companies may not survive _ just as
almost all the early railroads, carmakers and airlines did not.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the hype, investors are reflecting this. Shares in
profitable technology providers such as Cisco, Oracle or Sun
Microsystems are doing well. But nearly three-quarters of
Internet-related initial public offerings in America since mid-1995
now trade below their issue prices.
</P>
<P>
   And over the past year the shares of several big American
e-commerce firms have crashed: eToys (down 80 percent from its
peak), Priceline (down 69 percent) and E*Trade (down 66 percent),
for example.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet bubble in Europe and Asia seems sure to be followed
by similar collapses.
</P>
<P>
   The second concern is one voiced by managers of traditional
(non-tech) firms. Their share prices, they say, have been savaged
just because investors are, irrationally, redirecting their capital
into glamorous technology and Internet firms.
</P>
<P>
   Some say they are being punished despite healthy results;
several talk of a misallocation of capital from profitable to
loss-making activities. Yet many of these gripes are misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet bubble is clearly distorting the market, and its
bursting may well cause pain across the whole economy. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 825) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, whenever firms can raise capital virtually free, they
are likely to waste much of it, as so many dot.coms are now doing
with their marketing expenditure. But there is little evidence that
traditional firms' shares are undervalued, or that they are finding
it hard to raise capital.
</P>
<P>
   And the capital going into Internet firms is not all being
wasted _ even if today's shareholders may not reap the benefits.
This is especially true of makers of computers and the Internet's
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   But even an e-retailer such as Amazon needs robust computers,
software and delivery systems _ all of which necessitate
investment. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bigger point is that the markets are sending traditional
companies two useful signals. One is that they ignore the Internet
at their peril.
</P>
<P>
   The second is that merely adding a Web site on to an existing
business is not enough: the whole business needs to be redesigned
around the cost-saving, communication-easing properties of the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies must become Internet firms if they are to
survive. Even when the bubble deflates, that signal will be worth
heeding. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it a fleeting fancy, or a life-changing love? The question
lingers over today's obsession with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   On one side, electronic commerce is exploding, and the stock
markets' dot.com mania seems to be migrating from America to Europe
and Japan, and even to emerging economies.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, delivery snarl-ups have besmirched the
reputation of electronic retailers, and profits from doing business
on the World Wide Web are largely nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   What is one to conclude? Let's sift through the sense and
nonsense surrounding the business-to-consumer e-boom.
</P>
<P>
   There is much hype, but there is also a solid base in reality.
And this suggests that the second answer to the lingering question
is closer to the mark.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is profoundly affecting almost all business and
commerce. A common slogan is true: any big firm that fails to
grapple with the consequences is putting its future at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers tell only part of the story. In 1999 global e-commerce
was worth a little over $150 billion. Around 80 percent of those
transactions were between one business and another.
</P>
<P>
   Yet growth of all forms of e-commerce is hectic.
Business-to-business Web exchanges are mushrooming. In America
e-retailing revenues tripled last year; in Europe and Japan they
rose faster still.
</P>
<P>
   The absolute level of consumer e-commerce is still small, at
around 1 percent of American retail sales. But in some areas its
share is far higher: 15 percent of retail stockbroking and 5
percent of book sales, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   The influence of the Internet stretches farther than such
figures suggest. It is used more as a source of information than as
a place to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys in America suggest that last year, when less than 3
percent of new car sales were made over the Web, 40 percent
involved it at some stage, usually for price comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   And e-commerce often needs to take only a small share of the pie
to have a big impact on what is left. Travel agents' margins are so
flimsy that a loss of 3 percent of their market to the Web would be
enough to push many out of business.
</P>
<P>
   One impact is thus to intensify competition, producing benefits
to consumers in lower prices and more choice, at the expense of
producers and intermediaries. But a more profound effect is a
wholesale restructuring of businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the rise of e-commerce, such giant firms as General
Motors, Ford and, this week, Unilever, are embracing the Internet
for many of their activities. And the giants' move means that their
suppliers, as well as intermediaries through whom they sell, must
take to the Internet too.
</P>
<P>
   The promised land that this ripple effect holds out is one of
more transparency, greater efficiency and, yes, higher
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Hard macroeconomic evidence of these things is admittedly still
elusive. But it is at least conceivable that new technology and the
Internet may be partly responsible for America's unexpectedly
strong recent productivity growth, as well as its surprisingly low
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   So is the Internet leading to economic nirvana _ and does
dot.com mania make sense? Not quite.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet may be transforming business; but it is not
rewriting economics to enable the American economy to expand at its
current rate without dangerously overheating. Nor does the
explosion of e-commerce justify the current high prices of many
Internet-related shares.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, all the signs are that the markets remain in
the grip of a technology-related bubble. Many equity markets
currently look overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   But Internet shares are causing particular concern, for two
reasons. One is simply that their overvaluation looks so huge.
</P>
<P>
   Because few make profits, normal earnings-related measures
cannot be used. But even enthusiasts concede that as many as 80
percent of today's Internet companies may not survive _ just as
almost all the early railroads, carmakers and airlines did not.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the hype, investors are reflecting this. Shares in
profitable technology providers such as Cisco, Oracle or Sun
Microsystems are doing well. But nearly three-quarters of
Internet-related initial public offerings in America since mid-1995
now trade below their issue prices.
</P>
<P>
   And over the past year the shares of several big American
e-commerce firms have crashed: eToys (down 80 percent from its
peak), Priceline (down 69 percent) and E*Trade (down 66 percent),
for example.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet bubble in Europe and Asia seems sure to be followed
by similar collapses.
</P>
<P>
   The second concern is one voiced by managers of traditional
(non-tech) firms. Their share prices, they say, have been savaged
just because investors are, irrationally, redirecting their capital
into glamorous technology and Internet firms.
</P>
<P>
   Some say they are being punished despite healthy results;
several talk of a misallocation of capital from profitable to
loss-making activities. Yet many of these gripes are misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet bubble is clearly distorting the market, and its
bursting may well cause pain across the whole economy. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 825) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, whenever firms can raise capital virtually free, they
are likely to waste much of it, as so many dot.coms are now doing
with their marketing expenditure. But there is little evidence that
traditional firms' shares are undervalued, or that they are finding
it hard to raise capital.
</P>
<P>
   And the capital going into Internet firms is not all being
wasted _ even if today's shareholders may not reap the benefits.
This is especially true of makers of computers and the Internet's
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   But even an e-retailer such as Amazon needs robust computers,
software and delivery systems _ all of which necessitate
investment. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bigger point is that the markets are sending traditional
companies two useful signals. One is that they ignore the Internet
at their peril.
</P>
<P>
   The second is that merely adding a Web site on to an existing
business is not enough: the whole business needs to be redesigned
around the cost-saving, communication-easing properties of the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies must become Internet firms if they are to
survive. Even when the bubble deflates, that signal will be worth
heeding. &QL;

   &UR; HEALTH-CARE STRATEGY OF THE WEEK: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   During a town-hall meeting in South Carolina, George W. Bush was
asked what he would do about a woman's medical insurance which
doesn't cover her son's chronic illness. Bush's analysis: ``I'm
sorry. I wish I could wave a wand.'' (Salon.com, Feb. 18) &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACTOID OF THE WEEK: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Some 23 million Americans watched the Fox television show ``Who
Wants To Marry A Multimillionaire?'' on Tuesday night. At the same
time, 3 million people watched the Republican presidential debate. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HUNK OF THE WEEK: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, who was challenged to take part in the ``stakeout
workout.'' The ``workout,'' practiced by bored cameramen, consists
of weightlifting with a 30-lb. camera. Gore impressed watchers with
nine curls with his right arm, six with his left. He also swung the
$75,000 camera over his head several times. (Los Angeles Times,
Feb. 20) &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BACKHANDED COMPLIMENTS OF THE WEEK: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Former New York Senator Al D'Amato on John McCain: ``He is the
Don Quixote of modern-day politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Sam Johnson of Texas on Bush: ``He was a pilot in
the Texas National Guard. So it's not like he doesn't know the
military.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressman J.C. Watts, filling in for a delayed Bush in South
Carolina: ``In order to be a good president, you don't have to be a
foreign- or domestic-policy wonk. You can buy dozens of policy
wonks. You don't have to be clever. You can buy clever.'' (New York
Times, Feb. 19) &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FOOD OF THE WEEK: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Crisp rashers. As Bush left a restaurant in Greenville, S.C.,
over the weekend, a truck pulled up and dumped a load of cow manure
on the street. The driver got out of the truck, dressed as a pig,
shouting, ``Meat is death! Pork is murder!'' Bush later commented,
``I'm glad I had bacon for breakfast.'' (Los Angeles Times, Feb.
20) &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SONG OF THE WEEK: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   As jubilant supporters waited for George W. Bush's victory
speech in South Carolina, a pop group strutted on stage to
entertain the crowd. The large contingent of white-haired dames
looked unhappy enough at the lead singer's leather trousers; but
when he opened his set, unhappiness blossomed into disgust.
``Living the Vida Loca, with skins the color of mocha,'' the man
intoned, as the dames headed for the door. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DUBIOUS TACTIC OF THE WEEK: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign admitted, then denied, telephoning
supporters and entering their donations online. Internet experts
now question whether the senator's record $4 million, raised via
his Web site, resulted from high-tech genius and a spontaneous
groundswell of support or just good old-fashioned glad-handing. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BUSHISM OF THE WEEK: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say to countries in the Middle East, don't you dare
hold us hostile.'' (Detroit, Feb. 21) &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DELEGATE TOTALS OF THE WEEK: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Bush, 67; McCain, 96. A Republican candidate requires at least
1,034 of the 2,066 national delegates. &QL;

<P>
   Some 23 million Americans watched the Fox television show ``Who
Wants To Marry A Multimillionaire?'' on Tuesday night. At the same

<P>
   &UR; HUNK OF THE WEEK: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, who was challenged to take part in the ``stakeout
workout.'' The ``workout,'' practiced by bored cameramen, consists
of weightlifting with a 30-lb. camera. Gore impressed watchers with
nine curls with his right arm, six with his left. He also swung the
$75,000 camera over his head several times. (Los Angeles Times,
Feb. 20) &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BACKHANDED COMPLIMENTS OF THE WEEK: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Former New York Senator Al D'Amato on John McCain: ``He is the
Don Quixote of modern-day politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Sam Johnson of Texas on Bush: ``He was a pilot in
the Texas National Guard. So it's not like he doesn't know the
military.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressman J.C. Watts, filling in for a delayed Bush in South
Carolina: ``In order to be a good president, you don't have to be a
foreign- or domestic-policy wonk. You can buy dozens of policy
wonks. You don't have to be clever. You can buy clever.'' (New York
Times, Feb. 19) &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FOOD OF THE WEEK: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Crisp rashers. As Bush left a restaurant in Greenville, S.C.,
over the weekend, a truck pulled up and dumped a load of cow manure
on the street. The driver got out of the truck, dressed as a pig,
shouting, ``Meat is death! Pork is murder!'' Bush later commented,
``I'm glad I had bacon for breakfast.'' (Los Angeles Times, Feb.

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SONG OF THE WEEK: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   As jubilant supporters waited for George W. Bush's victory
speech in South Carolina, a pop group strutted on stage to
entertain the crowd. The large contingent of white-haired dames
looked unhappy enough at the lead singer's leather trousers; but
when he opened his set, unhappiness blossomed into disgust.
``Living the Vida Loca, with skins the color of mocha,'' the man
intoned, as the dames headed for the door. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DUBIOUS TACTIC OF THE WEEK: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign admitted, then denied, telephoning
supporters and entering their donations online. Internet experts
now question whether the senator's record $4 million, raised via
his Web site, resulted from high-tech genius and a spontaneous
groundswell of support or just good old-fashioned glad-handing. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; BUSHISM OF THE WEEK: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say to countries in the Middle East, don't you dare

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DELEGATE TOTALS OF THE WEEK: &LR;  &QC;

   Bush, 67; McCain, 96. A Republican candidate requires at least
1,034 of the 2,066 national delegates. &QL;

<P>
   SEATTLE _ ``This is the weirdest state I ever saw,'' says a
Seattle man who has lived in Washington state for 23 years after
spending time in Chicago, New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has never had a problem. Washington has cheap electricity,
no real social problems, companies like Microsoft, Boeing,
Starbucks and Nordstrom, a mild climate _ it's the spoiled rich kid
of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but even for a rich kid life has problems (ask George W.
Bush). This is beginning to dawn on Washington, and not least on
the state's largest city, Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the trouble is, on the face of it, just bad luck.
Seattle was host to the recent mugging of the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
   Then an Algerian was arrested in Port Angeles, on the state's
border with Canada, allegedly with a carload of explosive materials
bound for Seattle; so the city's millennium-eve party got
cancelled.
</P>
<P>
   There were a lot of people from Seattle among the 88 killed when
Alaska Airlines Flight 261 crashed on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   And now the most celebrated sportsman in the city's history, Ken
Griffey, Jr., center-fielder for the Seattle Mariners baseball
team, has decamped to Cincinnati, Ohio, a vulgar place of steamy
summer heat and barbecued pork.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also disquieting clouds on the economic horizon. A
decade of prosperity unmatched almost anywhere in the country may
be losing some of its brightness.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, which employed 104,000 people around Seattle in 1998, is
now down to under 80,000, and the number will fall further as
Airbus Industrie's challenge to Boeing obliges it to cut
production.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Seattle the forest-products industry is a shadow of its
pre-spotted-owl self, and the normally lucrative agricultural
sector based on wheat and apples has suffered badly from Asia's
economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
   The state total of unemployment claims is bigger than it was a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most tellingly, moving companies say that more people are now
leaving Washington state than are moving into it. This is a
remarkable turnabout.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration has exceeded emigration for nearly 25 years, and as
recently as 1997 newcomers outnumbered departures by two to one.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons for leaving mentioned to your correspondent include:
better job opportunities elsewhere (California, Oregon, Utah, North
Carolina); cheaper housing (darned near anywhere except San
Francisco and Manhattan); less rain (absolutely anywhere in the
United States). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 125 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 400) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If yesterday's newcomers had known more about the state's
history they might have been less surprised by some recent events.
</P>
<P>
   Take the WTO fiasco. Long before the Seattle area was home to
Microsoft and Amazon.com, it was the stamping ground of the most
militant trade unions on the West Coast. That streak of radicalism
still exists, and no doubt provided some of the demonstrators at
the anti-WTO riots.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``utterly unrealistic,'' says Walt Crowley, a local
historian, to think that Seattle's anti-globalizationists would
turn up at the WTO meeting and just ``quietly register their
objections.''
</P>
<P>
   The area's leftist past may also help to explain a growing
resentment about the huge income disparities of the Seattle
region. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In King County, which encompasses Seattle and cities such as
Redmond (where Microsoft is based), 23,500 cosseted software
workers earn an average of $287,700 a year apiece, including share
options. The median household income of everyone else in the county
is $34,300.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, despite the wide reach of the new prosperity,
that can be a real cause of indignation.
</P>
<P>
   The uneasy coexistence of new wealth and old tightwad populism
produces some curious contrasts. A $500 million new baseball
stadium completed last summer, and financed in large part out of
taxes, is the most expensive sports center in the nation.
(Unfortunately Griffey disliked it, and set off for Ohio.)
</P>
<P>
   But then, in November, voters overwhelmingly approved a measure
that cut the state's vehicle-license tax _ formerly about $400 a
year for a car valued at $20,000, though less for cheaper ones _ to
a flat $30 per vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   That shot a torpedo through the budgets for new roads and a
better ferry system, and is going to make the Seattle area's
traffic jams, already the country's third-worst, even more
maddening. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 50 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 725) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The irritation is not diminished by the fact that the city
council recently spent two weeks debating whether circus elephants
should be allowed into the city (they are badly treated, said the
opponents). Result: elephants in, by a five-to-four vote. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,000) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>

   Other fears are that the Asian economic recovery will prove less

<P>
   SEATTLE _ ``This is the weirdest state I ever saw,'' says a
Seattle man who has lived in Washington state for 23 years after
spending time in Chicago, New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has never had a problem. Washington has cheap electricity,
no real social problems, companies like Microsoft, Boeing,
Starbucks and Nordstrom, a mild climate _ it's the spoiled rich kid
of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but even for a rich kid life has problems (ask George W.
Bush). This is beginning to dawn on Washington, and not least on
the state's largest city, Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the trouble is, on the face of it, just bad luck.
Seattle was host to the recent mugging of the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
   Then an Algerian was arrested in Port Angeles, on the state's
border with Canada, allegedly with a carload of explosive materials
bound for Seattle; so the city's millennium-eve party got
cancelled.
</P>
<P>
   There were a lot of people from Seattle among the 88 killed when
Alaska Airlines Flight 261 crashed on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   And now the most celebportsman in the city's history, Ken
Griffey, Jr., center-fielder for the Seattle Mariners baseball
team, has decamped to Cincinnati, Ohio, a vulgar place of steamy
summer heat and barbecued pork.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also disquieting clouds on the economic horizon. A
decade of prosperity unmatched almost anywhere in the country may
be losing some of its brightness.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, which employed 104,000 people around Seattle in 1998, is
now down to under 80,000, and the number will fall further as
Airbus Industrie's challenge to Boeing obliges it to cut
production.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Seattle the forest-products industry is a shadow of its
pre-spotted-owl self, and the normally lucrative agricultural
sector based on wheat and apples has suffered badly from Asia's
economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
   The state total of unemployment claims is bigger than it was a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most tellingly, moving companies say that more people are now
leaving Washington state than are moving into it. This is a
remarkable turnabout.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration has exceeded emigration for nearly 25 years, and as
recently as 1997 newcomers outnumbered departures by two to one.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons for leaving mentioned to your correspondent include:
better job opportunities elsewhere (California, Oregon, Utah, North
Carolina); cheaper housing (darned near anywhere except San
Francisco and Manhattan); less rain (absolutely anywhere in the
United States). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 125 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 400) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If yesterday's newcomers had known more about the state's
history they might have been less surprised by some recent events.
</P>
<P>
   Take the WTO fiasco. Long before the Seattle area was home to
Microsoft and Amazon.com, it was the stamping ground of the most
militant trade unions on the West Coast. That streak of radicalism
still exists, and no doubt provided some of the demonstrators at
the anti-WTO riots.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``utterly unrealistic,'' says Walt Crowley, a local
historian, to think that Seattle's anti-globalizationists would
turn up at the WTO meeting and just ``quietly register their
objections.''
</P>
<P>
   The area's leftist past may also help to explain a growing
resentment about the huge income disparities of the Seattle
region. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;

</P>
<P>
   In King County, which encompasses Seattle and cities such as
Redmond (where Microsoft is based), 23,500 cosseted software
workers earn an average of $287,700 a year apiece, including share
options. The median household income of everyone else in the county
is $34,300.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, despite the wide reach of the new prosperity,
that can be a real cause of indignation.
</P>
<P>
   The uneasy coexistence of new wealth and old tightwad populism
produces some curious contrasts. A $500 million new baseball
stadium completed last summer, and financed in large part out of
taxes, is the most expensive sports center in the nation.
(Unfortunately Griffey disliked it, and set off for Ohio.)
</P>
<P>
   But then, in November, voters overwhelmingly approved a measure
that cut the state's vehicle-license tax _ formerly about $400 a
year for a car valued at $20,000, though less for cheaper ones _ to
a flat $30 per vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   That shot a torpedo through the budgets for new roads and a
better ferry system, and is going to make the Seattle area's
traffic jams, already the country's third-worst, even more
maddening. &QL;

   The irritation is not diminished by the fact that the city
council recently spent two weeks debating whether circus elephants
should be allowed into the city (they are badly treated, said the
opponents). Result: elephants in, by a five-to-four vote. &QL;

   John McCain may be splitting the Republican Party asunder. But
when it comes to the rather more important question of the country
as a whole, he is more of a healer than a divider.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Saigon fell to the Communists in 1975, the United
States has been suffering from post-Vietnam stress disorder. McCain
is a vital part of the country's struggle to put the disorder
behind it.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnam War divided the United States more bitterly than any
war other than the Civil War. It maimed two presidencies. It
undermined the country's faith in its great institutions, as the
left railed against the people who got the country into the war and
the right railed, equally angrily, against those who made such a
hash of getting it out.
</P>
<P>
   It turned people not just against the ancient ideal of military
service but against the ideal of public service in general.
</P>
<P>
   If America's current malaise can be described as private
affluence and public anomie, then Vietnam bears much of the blame.
</P>
<P>
   In previous presidential campaigns the war has been the secret
that dared not speak its name. Bill Clinton could hardly feel
America's pain on the subject when he spent the war not inhaling in
Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   But many leading Republicans found it hard to accuse him of
being a draft-dodger when they too pulled strings to make sure that
they and their kind avoided service. Both Dan Quayle and George W.
Bush spent the war defending their native states against invasion
from their next-door neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, however, is putting the war at the heart of his
campaign. His acolytes do not turn up to his rallies carrying
portentous policy documents, as Bill Clinton's acolytes turned up
in 1992 with copies of ``Putting People First.''
</P>
<P>
   They turn up clutching copies of McCain's memoirs, ``Faith of My
Fathers,'' holding it aloft while he is speaking, often with tears
rolling down their faces.
</P>
<P>
   The book is all about how McCain found himself by going to serve
in Vietnam, and a constant refrain of his speeches is that his
fellow countrymen can find themselves, too, if they will only
rediscover the virtues of public service. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 375) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The change in the mood about military service began with an
outpouring of emotion about the Second World War. Steven
Spielberg's film, ``Saving Private Ryan,'' succeeded in mixing
bloody battle scenes with an uplifting story about an attempt to
save a mother from seeing her fourth son suffer the same fate as
his brothers, and die in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Brokaw's ``The Greatest Generation,'' a book about the men
and women who came of age in time for that war, has been on the New
York Times best-seller list for over a year.
</P>
<P>
   McCain provides the perfect link between the greatest generation
and the Vietnam generation. The white-haired senator looks as if he
could well have suffered at the hands of the Nazis rather than the
Communists.
</P>
<P>
   And his book is as much about his grandfather and father _ both
of them four-star admirals who saw distinguished service in the
Second World War _ as it is about himself. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The impact of ``Faith of My Fathers'' is stunning. It makes
Vietnam less of an isolated disaster, more a part of a grand
tradition of military service.
</P>
<P>
   The task of rehabilitation is made all the easier by the fact
that McCain spent most of the war being tortured by psychopaths,
not mowing down innocent villagers. &QL;

<P>
   On Oct. 26, 1967, he had to eject himself from his aircraft in
the sky above North Vietnam, breaking his left arm, his right arm
in three places and his right knee. A crowd of Vietnamese then
broke his shoulder with a rifle butt and bayoneted him in the
groin.
</P>
<P>
   The guards at the Hoa Lo Prison _ the infamous Hanoi Hilton _ at
first refused to give him medical treatment unless he revealed
military secrets and confessed to being a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on discovering that his father was commander-in-chief of
the Pacific fleet, they tried to turn him into a propaganda tool.
They wanted him to denounce America in return for medical
assistance. They also offered to release him, only to have the
offer rejected.
</P>
<P>
   When he was at last released, after five-and-a-half years in
captivity, he weighed less than 98 pounds and was unable to comb
his own hair, because his broken bones had healed so badly. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,125) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McCain's record in the war explains his appeal to two unexpected
groups of people. The first are the working-class Democrats who
came out to vote for him in such impressive numbers in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   These are the people whose fathers went off to fight in Vietnam
while their richer countrymen stayed at home burning flags and
getting degrees. And they are also the people who seethed with rage
when Jane Fonda shrilled for the Vietcong and Hollywood movies
turned Vietnam vets into drug-hazed zombies.
</P>
<P>
   The second group, the normally liberal chattering classes, is
rather more confused about its enthusiasm for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists are supposed to like him because he offers them free
doughnuts and unparalleled access. But the bright people's
enthusiasm for McCain runs much deeper than this, and extends to
those who have never set foot on his ``Straight Talk Express.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain speaks to the professional classes' guilt about not
serving in Vietnam just as clearly as he speaks to the Reagan
Democrats' anger about serving and being betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983 Christopher Buckley wrote a famous article lamenting the
fact that he and most of his peers had managed to get out of
serving in Vietnam. Much of the article was taken up with
remembering that he and his friends suffered not a jot of
deprivation at home while their less privileged countrymen were
dying in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But part of it was a meditation about what they had lost by not
going. ``We forfeited what might have been the ultimate
opportunity, in increasingly self-obsessed times, of making the
ultimate commitment to something greater than ourselves: the
survival of comrades.''
</P>
<P>
   The betting is still, though more warily, that the Republican
machine will propel Bush to the nomination this summer. But even if
McCain fails to capture his party's nomination, he may succeed in
doing something even more important.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of public service has been comprehensively trashed in
the wake of Vietnam, by the government-hating right as much as by
the establishment-bating left.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to McCain, it might just possibly be on its way to
becoming fashionable again. &QL;

   McCain's record in the war explains his appeal to two unexpected

came out to vote for him in such impressive numbers in Michigan.

   These are the people whose fathers went off to fight in Vietnam
while their richer countrymen stayed at home burning flags and

<P>
   In 1983 Christopher Buckley wrote a famous article lamenting the

<P>
   The betting is still, though more warily, that the Republican
machine will propel Bush to the nomination this summer. But even if
McCain fails to capture his party's nomination, he may succeed in

   The notion of public service has been comprehensively trashed in

   John McCain may be splitting the Republican Party asunder. But
when it comes to the rather more important question of the country
as a whole, he is more of a healer than a divider.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Saigon fell to the Communists in 1975, the United
States has been suffering from post-Vietnam stress disorder. McCain
is a vital part of the country's struggle to put the disorder
behind it.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnam War divided the United States more bitterly than any
war other than the Civil War. It maimed two presidencies. It
undermined the country's faith in its great institutions, as the
left railed against the people who got the country into the war and
the right railed, equally angrily, against those who made such a
hash of getting it out.
</P>
<P>
   It turned people not just against the ancient ideal of military
service but against the ideal of public service in general.
</P>
<P>
   If America's current malaise can be described as private
affluence and public anomie, then Vietnam bears much of the blame.
</P>
<P>
   In previous presidential campaigns the war has been the secret
that dared not speak its name. Bill Clinton could hardly feel
America's pain on the subject when he spent the war not inhaling in
Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   But many leading Republicans found it hard to accuse him of
being a draft-dodger when they too pulled strings to make sure that
they and their kind avoided service. Both Dan Quayle and George W.
Bush spent the war defending their native states against invasion
from their next-door neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, however, is putting the war at the heart of his
campaign. His acolytes do not turn up to his rallies carrying
portentous policy documents, as Bill Clinton's acolytes turned up
in 1992 with copies of ``Putting People First.''
</P>
<P>
   They turn up clutching copies of McCain's memoirs, ``Faith of My
Fathers,'' holding it aloft while he is speaking, often with tears
rolling down their faces.
</P>
<P>
   The book is all about how McCain found himself by going to serve
in Vietnam, and a constant refrain of his speeches is that his
fellow countrymen can find themselves, too, if they will only
rediscover the virtues of public service. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The change in the mood about military service began with an
outpouring of emotion about the Second World War. Steven
Spielberg's film, ``Saving Private Ryan,'' succeeded in mixing
bloody battle scenes with an uplifting story about an attempt to
save a mother from seeing her fourth son suffer the same fate as
his brothers, and die in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Brokaw's ``The Greatest Generation,'' a book about the men
and women who came of age in time for that war, has been on the New
York Times best-seller list for over a year.
</P>
<P>
   McCain provides the perfect link between the greatest generation
and the Vietnam generation. The white-haired senator looks as if he
could well have suffered at the hands of the Nazis rather than the
Communists.
</P>
<P>
   And his book is as much about his grandfather and father _ both
of them four-star admirals who saw distinguished service in the
Second World War _ as it is about himself. &QL;

   When book-buying on the Internet took off, it seemed as if it
would spell the end of book clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Now the story looks a little different: not so much new
technology kills old business, as old business reinvents itself to
use new technology for its own ends.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for book clubs is that Internet bookshops offer
discounted best-sellers without demanding any commitment from their
customers. Consumers were quick to notice this.
</P>
<P>
   At Doubleday Direct, which is one of America's biggest book-club
companies, the enrollment rate dropped by nearly 10 percent between
1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann, Doubleday Direct's owners, and, with 25 million
members, the largest book-club company in the world, accordingly
rushed into online retailing. In 1998 it paid $200 million for 50
percent Barnesandnoble.com, and last year it launched bol.com in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Time Warner's Book of the Month Club and
Doubleday Direct's Literary Guild announced that they were joining
forces on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond all the panic and the consolidation, bits of the
book-club business are finding their way on to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Doubleday Direct has employed Seth Radwell, an e-commerce man
who helped launch Bertelsmann's online retailing, to run Doubleday
Interactive, its Web arm. Radwell is redesigning the book club for
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The old, general-interest book clubs are never going to be able
to match big online retailers on range, or on discounted
best-sellers. But Amazon and the others will find it harder to
compete in special-interest categories.
</P>
<P>
   For those niches, where newspaper reviews and best-seller lists
are irrelevant, recommendations are particularly important; and the
online booksellers' automated
``people-who-bought-that-also-bought-this'' systems are
unsatisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   Book clubs have people, not software, to make recommendations.
Book clubs also have a different business model: they are not
distributors, but licensed by publishers to produce their own
editions. This enables them to discount all books, and not just
best-sellers.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet even offers book clubs some advantages. It makes
launching specialist clubs cheaper, because small audiences are
easier to find. Radwell is adapting the business so that it can
exploit this.
</P>
<P>
   Among Doubleday Direct's new and upcoming products are Venus
(erotica for women), Black Expressions (for black families), Mango
(for young women), Rhapsody (for romance) and a gay-and-lesbian
club.
</P>
<P>
   The early signs are encouraging. Black Expressions, for
instance, was expected to pick up 5,000 members in the three months
after it went online in October. It got 30,000, and has added
another 10,000 since.
</P>
<P>
   Doubleday Direct's total enrollment through traditional means is
still falling _ it is now down to around 80 percent of 1998 levels
_ but online recruitment is picking up fast.
</P>
<P>
   This year's projections show that by the end of this fiscal
year, in June, the Internet should account for nearly a fifth of
new enrollments, so that total enrollments should be nearly back to
their peak.
</P>
<P>
   At Bertelsmann, hope is slowly replacing panic. &QL;

<P>
   When book-buying on the Internet took off, it seemed as if it
would spell the end of book clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Now the story looks a little different: not so much new
technology kills old business, as old business reinvents itself to
use new technology for its own ends.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for book clubs is that Internet bookshops offer
discounted best-sellers without demanding any commitment from their
customers. Consumers were quick to notice this.
</P>
<P>
   At Doubleday Direct, which is one of America's biggest book-club
companies, the enrollment rate dropped by nearly 10 percent between
1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann, Doubleday Direct's owners, and, with 25 million
members, the largest book-club company in the world, accordingly
rushed into online retailing. In 1998 it paid $200 million for 50
percent Barnesandnoble.com, and last year it launched bol.com in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Time Warner's Book of the Month Club and
Doubleday Direct's Literary Guild announced that they were joining
forces on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond all the panic and the consolidation, bits of the
book-club business are finding their way on to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Doubleday Direct has employed Seth Radwell, an e-commerce man
who helped launch Bertelsmann's online retailing, to run Doubleday
Interactive, its Web arm. Radwell is redesigning the book club for
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The old, general-interest book clubs are never going to be able
to match big online retailers on range, or on discounted
best-sellers. But Amazon and the others will find it harder to
compete in special-interest categories.
</P>
<P>
   For those niches, where newspaper reviews and best-seller lists
are irrelevant, recommendations are particularly important; and the
online booksellers' automated
``people-who-bought-that-also-bought-this'' systems are
unsatisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   Book clubs have people, not software, to make recommendations.
Book clubs also have a different business model: they are not
distributors, but licensed by publishers to produce their own
editions. This enables them to discount all books, and not just
best-sellers.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet even offers book clubs some advantages. It makes
launching specialist clubs cheaper, because small audiences are
easier to find. Radwell is adapting the business so that it can
exploit this.
</P>
<P>
   Among Doubleday Direct's new and upcoming products are Venus
(erotica for women), Black Expressions (for black families), Mango
(for young women), Rhapsody (for romance) and a gay-and-lesbian
club.
</P>
<P>
   The early signs are encouraging. Black Expressions, for
instance, was expected to pick up 5,000 members in the three months
after it went online in October. It got 30,000, and has added
another 10,000 since.
</P>
<P>
   Doubleday Direct's total enrollment through traditional means is
still falling _ it is now down to around 80 percent of 1998 levels
_ but online recruitment is picking up fast.
</P>
<P>
   This year's projections show that by the end of this fiscal
year, in June, the Internet should account for nearly a fifth of
new enrollments, so that total enrollments should be nearly back to
their peak.
</P>
<P>
   At Bertelsmann, hope is slowly replacing panic. &QL;

<P>
   If proof were needed that we are past halftime in the sexual
revolution, it is provided by a lively new book, ``Father
Courage,'' by Suzanne Braun Levine (Harcourt; 228 pages; $24).
</P>
<P>
   A chronicle of the struggles of a sample of American fathers
trying to find a new balance between what the author calls the
``Triple Crown'' (family, work and social life), it shows the other
side of the phenomenon of the working woman: the phenomenon of the
family man.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with some surprising facts: an American survey in
which 93 percent of men and women agreed that the care of children
should be shared equally by both parents; and a finding by the
author that, ``Not one man I spoke to wanted to be the same kind of
father that he had had.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s have been described as a decade of ``men behaving
badly.'' ``Father Courage'' suggests that over the next ten years,
at least in America, men may try to make amends by taking on more
of the responsibilities of raising their children.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the issues facing these (inevitably working) men will be
the same as those that faced women, 30 or more years ago, when they
set out to redress what they saw as unacceptable gender imbalances.
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost, there is the guilt. For women, it was mostly
about not being there for their kids; for men, it's about not
maximizing their pay, about not providing ``enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides also have in common an uncomfortable feeling that
they are in denial of the things that they were best designed for:
the deep-seated view that men are outdoor hunter/gatherers and
women are homemaking sucklers...and rarely the twain shall meet.
</P>
<P>
   There are also social and political barriers to be surmounted
before either gender is free to make the sort of choices that will
transform society from one, as Levine puts it, ``in which half of
human experience has been off-limits to the other half of the
population.''
</P>
<P>
   The political landscape could be tilted more in favor of
families, she believes, whilst in the workplace there is ``the
unabated pressure on a man to perform as if he had no other life.''
Employers are rarely as accommodating as they might be.
</P>
<P>
   For Levine, ``The courage to renounce travel stands out as the
signal act of a truly committed parent.'' But few of the companies
which profess to be so keen on equal opportunities for women take
pains to accommodate the fathers who want to be home when the
equally-opportuned mums are not.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the home, Levine says that men have to fight for
equality. Women, she says, are reluctant to ``relinquish the
mystical powers attributed to motherhood and really share the glory
as well as the housework.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the issues facing today's superdads are quite different
from those that faced yesterday's supermums.
</P>
<P>
   By traditional standards, women were fighting to take a step up.
But by those same standards, men are often asking to take a step
down. This presents problems, not so much because it's a step down
to change baby's diapers, but because it's a step down to earn less
than baby's mum.
</P>
<P>
   It makes competition between the sexes continuous and on all
fronts. It turns women into breadwinners and men into consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The pity is that Levine's study is limited to the United States.
For only there has the cohort of baby-boomer supermums created a
generation of men that want to be superdads _ that want (like their
mothers) to have a go at having it all.
</P>
<P>
   In most other parts of the world, women are still raising their
boys to expect the old-style contract in which, in return for
breadwinning, they gain a support structure that keeps their
children (and much else) at arm's length.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the change in America is the assumption that there is
little that is more rewarding for any parent than to walk
hand-in-hand to school with their adoring seven-year-old and no
agenda other than the walk.
</P>
<P>
   Some fathers have yet to be convinced of this. Even when they
know they can't have it all, they still think they'll be better off
as the chairman of General Motors. &QL;

<P>
   By and large, scientists are an optimistic bunch. They are quite
happy to leave fretting about doom and gloom to the philosophers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them can even remain cheerful when considering something
that most people would regard as deeply depressing: the eventual
destruction of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   The earth's fate is tied to that of the sun, which the laws of
stellar evolution suggest will swell into a ``red giant,''
swallowing the earth up in about five billion years' time.
</P>
<P>
   The details, however, are obscure. George Bowen and Lee Ann
Willson of Iowa State University decided to work them out.
</P>
<P>
   Their calculations suggest that the earth will survive the sun's
initial sudden swelling, but that the drag from the expanded solar
atmosphere will then cause its orbit to shrink until it is
consumed.
</P>
<P>
   The landscape shortly before the end will be apocalyptic indeed.
The surface temperature will reach 2,000 degrees C (3632 degrees
F), the oceans and the atmosphere having long since boiled away.
</P>
<P>
   This will produce a new atmosphere, which will consist not of
oxygen and nitrogen but of vaporized rock. The sky will be a deep,
vivid red because the sun will, in essence, have turned into a huge
red cloud.
</P>
<P>
   The moon will have gone (atmospheric drag will cause it to crash
into the earth). Mars and Jupiter, tearing through the outer
reaches of the solar cloud at supersonic speeds, will appear as
bright streaks in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The earth's death spiral will last about 2 million years, as its
orbit shrinks and the sun continues to expand.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a flash, it will all be over. The planet will plummet
into the heart of the sun and disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Or will it? Fred Adams, a physicist at the University of
Michigan, has proposed a novel way in which the earth might escape
this fate.
</P>
<P>
   By running repeated computer simulations, he has worked out what
would happen if a red-dwarf star were to pass through the solar
system.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Adams has found that there is one chance in 100,000 that
this would cause the earth to be ejected from the solar system
before the sun becomes a red giant. The planet would then meet an
icy, rather than a fiery end, since after a million years or so the
oceans would freeze solid.
</P>
<P>
   Bacteria would still be able to live in hydrothermal vents at
the bottom of the oceans, kept going by heat generated
radioactively in the earth's crust. Indeed, they might survive for
as long as 30 billion years. But without a star to keep the earth
warm, other forms of life would be doomed to a chilly death.
</P>
<P>
   In a forthcoming paper in Icarus, however, Dr. Adams advances
another intriguing possibility: the earth could desert the sun and
team up with another star.
</P>
<P>
   This would require a pair of red dwarfs to encounter the solar
system and perform an elaborate gravitational dance with it for a
few thousand years.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of this time, the earth would elope with one of the
red dwarfs, which are extremely long-lived stars and would keep it
at least feebly warm for billions more years.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, the chances of this happening are only one in 3
million. But compared with being burned to a crisp, it would not be
the end of the world. &QL;

<P>
   By and large, scientists are an optimistic bunch. They are quite
happy to leave fretting about doom and gloom to the philosophers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them can even remain cheerful when considering something
that most people would regard as deeply depressing: the eventual
destruction of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   The earth's fate is tied to that of the sun, which the laws of
stellar evolution suggest will swell into a ``red giant,''
swallowing the earth up in about five billion years' time.
</P>
<P>
   The details, however, are obscure. George Bowen and Lee Ann
Willson of Iowa State University decided to work them out.
</P>
<P>
   Their calculations suggest that the earth will survive the sun's
initial sudden swelling, but that the drag from the expanded solar
atmosphere will then cause its orbit to shrink until it is
consumed.
</P>
<P>
   The landscape shortly before the end will be apocalyptic indeed.
The surface temperature will reach 2,000 degrees C (3632 degrees
F), the oceans and the atmosphere having long since boiled away.
</P>
<P>
   This will produce a new atmosphere, which will consist not of
oxygen and nitrogen but of vaporized rock. The sky will be a deep,
vivid red because the sun will, in essence, have turned into a huge
red cloud.

   BUSH-MCCAIN (Washington) _ California's Democratic governor,
Gray Davis, says former Sen. Bill Bradley has `a very large hill to
climb'' to beat Vice President Al Gore in next Tuesday's California
primary because the Clinton-Gore administration has done a lot for
the state. Meanwhile, on the Republican side, Sen. John McCain
appears to face an increasingly tough race in the New York primary
against Gov. George W. Bush. Pollster John Zogby says Catholic
voters are shifting to Bush after he apologized for failing to
criticize anti-Catholic teachings at Bob Jones University. By DAN

McCain and George W. Bush. Kennedy had to convince voters he was

the GOP is no longer a captive of the religious right. By MARIANNE

   ``His elevator doesn't go all the way to the top.'' _ The
ex-fiance of Rick Rockwell, in a 1991 petition for a restraining
order.
</P>
<P>
   ........................
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, none of us had heard of Rick Rockwell, the
leading man of the Fox-TV special, ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire''?
</P>
<P>
   Now I've got a 40-page file on the guy, brimming with news
clippings, Internet scoops, his show-biz resume, notes from people
who know him, court documents and publicity shots.
</P>
<P>
   This is what happens when you place yourself in the middle of a
pop culture phenomenon: Most of your life gets thwacked on the
media's doorstep, landing with all the subtlety of a big bag of
steaming ... information. And in Rockwell's case, we've found out
that he's a lot goofier and a bit more complex than the charming,
wealthy groom who proposed to one Darva Conger and then exchanged
wedding vows with her in front of a huge and stunned TV audience.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out Fox could have come up with all sorts of alternative
titles for the show, like, ``Who Wants to Marry a Publicity
Hound?''
</P>
<P>
   Or, ``Who Wants to Marry The Star of `Return of the Killer
Tomatoes'?''
</P>
<P>
   Or, ``Who Wants to Marry a Dude Who Drives a Volkswagen?''
</P>
<P>
   By now, a hungry media have uncovered all sorts of interesting
trivia about the no-longer-mysterious groom. (And perhaps it's only
a matter of time before one of Darva's ex-boyfriends sells naked
Polaroids of her on the Internet or spills secrets about her life
to the tabloids.)
</P>
<P>
   We now know that the former Richard Balkey is a cheesy comic and
rabid publicity dog who wrote and appeared in two ``Tomatoes''
sequels, did corporate comedy gigs, played a Russian guy in a
series of commercials for AM/PM mini-markets and was on ``Star
Search'' a half-dozen times.
</P>
<P>
   Among Rockwell's other stunts: Telling jokes for 30 straight
hours; bicycling from LA to Las Vegas to promote a comedy club; and
chartering a plane to take him to comedy gigs in six cities in one
night.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever a comic is that desperate for attention, you can be
sure of one thing: He ain't going to be that funny.
</P>
<P>
   When Rockwell emerged from the shadows and showed up on Fox's
doomed show, veterans of comedy clubs _ especially in Pittsburgh
and San Diego, where Rockwell has lived _ were falling out of their
chairs in disbelief. He's the Sugar Daddy! No way!
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Cohen, who now lives in Chicago, instantly remembered
Rockwell from her days doing standup comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm watching that downfall of modern society on TV, and it
turns out I know that multimillionaire!'' she laughed. ``He used to
play the Pittsburgh Funny Bone about three times a year, and he hit
the Chicago Improv regularly back when that was open.''
</P>
<P>
   An AP story quotes a San Diego dating-service owner who has
known Rockwell for years: ``I thought, `That's your millionaire?
You've got to be joking. He's a likable guy and he's funny, but
we're all wondering, when did he become a millionaire? How did we
miss that?''
</P>
<P>
   Some comics have accused Rockwell of joke-stealing. A woman told
a San Diego radio station that Rockwell professed his love for her
just before he did the TV show. An ex-girlfriend told a San Diego
station that Rockwell told her he was doing the whole thing as a
gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   In Vancouver, one real-estate agent claimed Rockwell's only
holding is a ``low-end condo that leaks,'' while another called him
a ``loser'' and a ``flake.'' Meanwhile, the San Diego Tribune noted
that Rockwell lives in a one-story, 1,200-square-foot house and
drives a Volkswagen. While the guy apparently is a millionaire on
paper, he's a long way from megarich. The lovely Darva has probably
been hit on by wealthier guys at her health club.
</P>
<P>
   And now, far from fantasyland, the glitzy couple will be just
one more set of statistics in the rosters of failed matrimony. The
torrent of negative publicity has been so relentless that Fox
canceled plans to air a one-hour repeat of the show. No doubt their
internal memos have headings like, ``Who Wants to Strangle This
Dopey Multimillionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents I've perused, an ex-fiance of
Rockwell's had some troubling things to say about him. Whether or
not her claims are true, his romantic past probably should have
been discussed with his new bride, as would be the case in almost
any marriage that doesn't take place six minutes after the couple
meets.
</P>
<P>
   When a 42-year-old and a 35-year-old get together, they're going
to have to address some bumps and mistakes in their respective
pasts. It's best to talk through at least some of it before saying,
``That's OK, I love ya anyway babe!''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe on that cruise ship they learned all kinds of things about
each other _ and life as well. Maybe they found the keys to such
puzzles as, ``What kind of an idiot marries a total stranger on
national TV?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Rick Asadoorian, the native son drafted first
by the Red Sox last June, comes from a Massachusetts town so small,
it's really not a town at all. Whitinsville (pop. 5,500) is
basically a borough of Northbridge, a relative metropolis of 13,000
located on the Mumford River, 14 miles southeast of Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   You can count the number of stoplights in Whitinsville on one
hand. There's one near the Burger King, another at the intersection
of Church and Prospect streets, and a double set of lights in
Memorial Square.
</P>
<P>
   Harry's Pizza is the most popular place to eat in town. There's
a diner that has gone through numerous name changes. It's Peg's
now, but when it was known as Fred's, it recruited a star athlete
from neighboring Auburn to play basketball. Him, you might have
heard of. Arthur Pappas grew up to be the Red Sox team doctor.
</P>
<P>
   But Pappas's name is on a short list of celebrities with
Whitinsville ties. Jane Swift, the lieutenant governor, lives here.
The in-laws of Millard Fillmore, the 13th President and one of the
least distinguished, once lived here. That apparently had the
locals busting with pride, because in the town history book,
there's a photo of the schoolhouse in which Fillmore's portrait
hangs above George Washington's.
</P>
<P>
   The town takes its name from John C. Whitin, founder of the
Whitin Machine Works, which at the height of the war employed
around 7,000 workers but is now shut down. Varkis Asadoorian, the
son of Armenian immigrants, worked 40 years there as a foundry
worker. He was a core maker, hard work in a mill town full of hard
workers, many of them with Armenian roots.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Popkin Kasparian was the oldest living player in
Northbridge High School history. Kasparian was a boy in Armenia
during the Turkish genocide in World War I. The Turks threw all the
boys of the village in a pit, then doused them with gasoline and
set it aflame. Little Popkin escaped the pit by climbing onto the
shoulders of his bigger brothers.
</P>
<P>
   One day, dodging death in Armenia. The next, living to play
football in America. That is a story that will be passed down from
generation to generation in Whitinsville. This may well be another,
the story of a gifted teenage outfielder who already has evoked
comparisons to one of the most beloved of all homegrown Sox
players, Tony Conigliaro. And it begins in Varkis Asadoorian's
backyard, where his grandson, 4-year-old Rick, first played Whiffle
Ball with his older brothers, Greg and Steve.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never let me hit,'' he said. ``I always had to shag.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning here, before the big leaguers took over the
premises, Asadoorian was still shagging, running down fly balls hit
to him by 80-year-old Johnny Pesky. The little boy has long since
grown into a 6-foot-2-inch, 185-pound frame, with more filling out
sure to come.
</P>
<P>
   Asadoorian moves with an easy grace that bespeaks his
athleticism, one that not only had the baseball scouts coming in
droves but enabled him to be a record-setting wide receiver and
kicker on the football team and shooting guard on the basketball
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, I like this kid,'' Pesky said. ``He reminds me of the
young Tony C.''
</P>
<P>
   Pesky was the Sox manager when Conigliaro first caught New
England's fancy. Conigliaro was 19, the same age as Asadoorian, who
was born after Conigliaro retired and knows of Tony C only through
his father and mother, Steve and Virginia. Steve Asadoorian was
Northbridge High class president and his future wife, Ginger
Tessier, was vice president and three-sport star in 1965, the year
after Conigliaro made his big-league debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad has told me some things about Tony C,'' Asadoorian
said. ``I don't really know the meaning of it, but I know it's a
really big compliment.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the summer after his junior year in high school that
Butch Hobson, the former Sox third baseman and manager, was
Asadoorian's manager in the Area Code games, a gathering of the
best high school players in the country held in San Diego that
July. Hobson pulled aside Asadoorian's father one morning and told
him: ``Your kid has a real chance to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   By last spring, there were plenty of big-league types who felt
the same way. Ray Fagnant, the Sox scout based in New England, had
been watching Asadoorian for some time. Sox scouting director Wayne
Britton came to see for himself, as did Eddie Haas, Dan Duquette's
special assistant. But they were hardly alone. At one Northbridge
game, there were 42 scouts in attendance, by Steve Asadoorian's
reckoning.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the afternoon Duquette showed up. ``My teammates
told me he was there, but I didn't see him,'' Asadoorian said. ``I
had a pretty good day, though. I think I went 4 for 5.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the draft last June, Asadoorian was on his senior
class trip in Connecticut but was carrying a pager he'd borrowed
from a cousin. The pager went off early that afternoon. ``I looked
at it,'' Asadoorian said, ``and it said, `Red Sox. No. 17.' I
thought, `Awesome.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, who picked 17th, signed Asadoorian two months later to
a $1.725 million bonus, the largest ever given by the Sox to a
drafted player. So much for the option of going to the University
of Florida. On the night the team announced the signing, Fagnant
said: ``I could scout for 30 more years and not come across another
like Rick. He has all the tools. His arm is a jaw-dropper. And he's
bright, mature, confident and humble.''
</P>
<P>
   Fagnant said he told Asadoorian: ``Opening Day, 2003, center
field in the new Fenway Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Asadoorian knows that just as with the new Fenway, it may not
happen that quickly. In that sense, this is not Tony C redux. He'd
love to begin his pro career playing a full schedule in Augusta
(Ga.) of the South Atlantic League, but knows he may start in
Lowell, which plays a shorter season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm not ready to play in the big leagues or even Double
A and maybe not Single A,'' he said. ``I don't have a time limit
for myself. I don't say I have to be there in three years. When I
talked to Wayne Britten he said, `There's no reason to rush.' I
don't want to put added pressure on myself.''
</P>
<P>
   On that giddy first night in Fenway, when Asadoorian was asked
to say a few words during the Sox radio broadcast, his thoughts ran
to Varkis Asadoorian, who had come to so many of his games and
whose picture was on the family refrigerator, his grandson in his
No. 44 jersey, arm wrapped around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, Grampy,'' Asadoorian said.
</P>
<P>
   Asadoorian attended the Sox instructional league last fall, then
came back on his own after Thanksgiving and except for a quick trip
home for Christmas, has been working out ever since. This week, he
has been taking part in the team's minicamp for its top minor
leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   Steve and Ginger Asadoorian hope to visit their son here next
week. Rick's brother, Steve, is a senior on the UMass baseball
team, which will be playing Florida at Gainesville, then the family
was going to drive down here. Steve was going to take time off from
his job as a union rep for the Mass. Federation of Teachers, Ginger
from hers as a math professor at Quinsigamond College.
</P>
<P>
   Varkis Asadoorian so much wanted to come see his grandson, too.
But his health is failing rapidly. A diabetic, he already has had
one leg amputated and may soon lose the other. He also is legally
blind, another consequence of the condition.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Rick's father also was diagnosed with diabetes.
``You see it and you wonder if that's in front of you,'' Steve
Asadoorian said, ``but you deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's something of a tradition in Whitinsville. Remember Popkin
Kasparian, the boy who climbed out of a pit of fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone can't wait to see Rick play someday in Boston,''
Steve Asadoorian said, ``Maybe his grandfather can't see him play
anymore, but he is so thrilled and proud that everybody is rooting
for him.''

HERBERICH OPTS TO PUT HIS SLED ON ICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ACTON, Mass. _ Jim Herberich comes down to greet a visitor in
the lobby of the environmental consulting firm where he works. He
is wearing a buttoned-down shirt and slacks, indoor clothes for
what used to be his outdoor season. ``I'm not used to coming here
when it's snowing out,'' Herberich says.
</P>
<P>
   This winter, he normally would have been driving a bobsled on
the World Cup circuit. Instead, Herberich was sitting in front of a
computer in Nagog Office Park, analyzing hydrological data. ``All
I'm doing,'' he says, ``is picking up for a full year what I used
to do for a half year.''
</P>
<P>
   For the other half, from October through February, Herberich
would steer a rattling metal jalopy with one or three other men
aboard at 80 miles per hour down an iced concrete run.
</P>
<P>
   Herberich had been doing it since the Reagan era, when he was a
quarter-miler fresh out of Harvard, looking for a new athletic
diversion before he joined the 9-to-5 crowd. He had made the US
team again last autumn and was on track to make his fourth Olympic
team for the Games in Salt Lake City two years from now.
</P>
<P>
   And then, just before he was scheduled to fly across the ocean,
Herberich put his helmet on the shelf. He was 36, had been riding
the roller coaster for 15 years and had enough USA logo gear to
fill a closet. That was enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot of things coming together,'' Herberich says.
``The travel and the lifestyle had really begun to wear on me even
before the 1998 Games. Living out of a bag for half the year wasn't
what I wanted to be doing any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Making yet another trip to Olympus wasn't enough reason to keep
sliding. Salt Lake held no romance for him. Herberich has been
there often enough that he can draw its street grid from memory.
``Part of the interesting thing about the Olympics is being
somewhere else,'' he says. And what founder Baron Pierre de
Coubertin said about the Games _ that the most important thing is
taking part _ isn't as true the fourth time around.
</P>
<P>
   Herberich has been seventh at Olympus before. The only reason to
go back was to win a medal. No American driver has managed that
since 1956 and Herberich wasn't sure he could make the commitment
required to make the podium. ``There are so many variables,'' he
says, ``and I didn't think I had control of enough of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Herberich had been getting the retirement itch even before
Nagano, but he came back the next October for another go and
competed all season with a fractured pubic bone. When the symptoms
returned last fall, Herberich came home for a bone scan _ and a
career assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I laid out all the pros and cons,'' he says. ``At first I
thought, maybe I should just go away for a while, then come back
and train again. Then I said no, I don't want to do that. It just
seemed like a good time to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Herberich had been going up the mountain since 1985, when he got
one of the recruiting letters that were being sent to athletes
(like including football players, decathletes and runners) who
might make good bobsledders. The federation was looking for ``big,
fast, crazy guys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You qualify on the third count,'' Harvard track coach Frank
Haggerty assured Herberich.
</P>
<P>
   So Herberich went to Lake Placid, took a special fitness test
and topped it. Matt Roy, the top US driver, promptly tapped
Herberich for his brakeman and three years later Herberich was in
Calgary for the Olympics. ``I'm pretty much hooked on this,'' he
concluded, ``but I'm not going to push any more.''
</P>
<P>
   So Herberich switched to driving and became a fixture on the US
squad. During autumn and winter, he hopscotched from Germany to
Switzerland to Latvia to Austria to Italy to France. During spring
and fall, he worked for ENSR, an international firm that does
environmental consulting and engineering work.
</P>
<P>
   His employers were terrific about his dual life, Herberich says,
and his colleagues were delighted to have an Olympian on the
premises. ``Everyone was very supportive,'' he says. ``People get
excited when they have a personal connection to the Olympics. They
were always coming up and saying what a wonderful thing it was to
watch the Games knowing I was competing.''
</P>
<P>
   Herberich made the team again for Lillehammer in 1994 and again
for Nagano. He had become a lock as USA II, right behind Brian
Shimer. And though his best results came in the two-man event,
Herberich loved the four-man.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like driving a 1,400-pound truck down a mountain at
death-defying speed,'' he says. ``It's like a roller coaster ride.
Scare yourself silly _ and go do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobsledders call it the ``champagne of thrills'' and Herberich
could have kept going all the way to Utah. ``It wasn't just the
excitement and thrills, but the challenge,'' he says. ``But it was
a full-time job for two minutes of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   So even though the bone scan came back negative last fall,
Herberich's mind was made up. ``I sort of expected this,'' US coach
Steve Maiorca said when Herberich called him. The tougher task was
breaking the news to brakeman Dave Owens. ``That was hard,''
Herberich says. ``We'd tied our futures together. He was in Newark
on his way to Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens caught on with Shimer's crew and four-man pusher Doug
Sharp was picked up by Todd Hays. And Herberich put on his street
clothes and went back to the office park. ``It was the first time
in 15 years that I was home for Thanksgiving,'' he says. ``And my
girlfriend is extremely happy that I'm not on tour all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   On weekends, Herberich went online to check on the action from
St. Moritz and Cortina and Altenberg and the rest of the tracks he
could drive in his sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd pull up the results on a Sunday afternoon to see how they
did and there was no feeling like, gee, I can beat these guys,''
Herberich says. ``That really proved to me that I made the right
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   When he went to Germany last month for the world championships
in Altenberg, his favorite track, Herberich went as a technical
observer. When 2002 comes around, he'll be the director of race
operations for the Olympic bobsledding events at Salt Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a crime for me not to keep involved in some way,''
said Herberich. ``Bobsledding is the one thing I've done for a
longer time than anything in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   He still has his old two-man sled. ``And when I'm in Park City I
can give passenger rides and get it out of my system,'' he says.
But the USA gear is staying in the closet for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I would have liked to have won some races, done better
at World Cups and better at the 1998 Olympics,'' Herberich shrugs.
``But I don't look back on anything with regret.''
</P>
<P>
   He rode the icy roller coaster longer than most and walked away
in one piece. ``I broke a bone here and there,'' Herberich says.
``Broke a collarbone in 1988 in Calgary. Shimer and I crashed an
old sled.''
</P>
<P>
   But nothing that scrambled his brains or put him in a body cast.
Quitting while ahead is one of the vanishing arts in America. ``The
only sport I'm doing now,'' says Jim Herberich, ``is seeing how
fast I can run through the channels on the remote control.''

&HT;     POLITICIAN SPEAKS IN CODE THAT MAKES SENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I don't know what the California version is of
the Congressional Medal of Honor, but I think State Sen. Debra
Bowen ought to get one.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat from Marina Del Rey, Bowen has finally done something
so sensible _ and overdue _ it's hard to believe it came from a
politician.
</P>
<P>
   She recently introduced a bill that would require the California
Public Utilities Commission to assign new telephone area codes on
the basis of technology, not geography.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is hardly new. Since the very first Americans learned
that competition among carriers and the proliferation of cell
phones had forced a ``split'' of their longstanding area code,
plenty of phone customers have wondered: ``Why don't they give cell
phone users their own area code and leave the rest of us the hell
alone?''
</P>
<P>
   For awhile, the excuse was ``the technology'' being too
unsophisticated. This really meant: We could do it, but it would
cost a lot of money, and then we couldn't spread cell phones like
some airborne virus throughout the population.
</P>
<P>
   So, instead, city after city and region after region was carved
up and subdivided. People who had had the same area code since the
system went public back in the Eisenhower era _ when all area codes
were an easy-to-remember numerical sandwich with a ``0'' or a ``1''
as the meat _ suddenly found themselves with nasty three-digit
combinations like 582 and 831.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, they suddenly found themselves forced to dial more
numbers to call Grandma or the office, just a few miles away, even
though neither party had moved an inch.
</P>
<P>
   How out of control have things gotten?
</P>
<P>
   Until Bowen's bill, San Francisco, a compact city whose borders
have long stopped at 49 square miles, faced one of two equally ugly
fates: A geographic split into two area code parcels or a ghastly
``overlay'' system.
</P>
<P>
   With the former, a gerrymandered line that cuts off downtown and
the Financial District from the rest of the city and Marin County
would be used to determine who keeps ``415'' and who loses it.
Folks who may have owned their home and the same rotary dial phone
for 45 years in the Sunset District might get the weird new code.
Or some 100-year-old business downtown might get it.
</P>
<P>
   The only alternative offered for this stupidity was another
stupidity: the dreadful ``geographic overlay.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody with ``415'' could keep it, but all new phone service
_ even for the house next door _ would get the new area code. And
everybody would have to dial the area code plus the seven-digit
number, even for phones in the same code.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we look around the state at what's happening, area code
after area code is changing,'' Bowen told the San Francisco
Examiner. ``It doesn't make any sense to wait until we're near a
crisis and running out of numbers to then go and change numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   God bless Bowen for at least trying to mitigate total disaster.
</P>
<P>
   If her bill passes _ and that first requires the Federal
Communications Commission to lift its antiquated prohibition
against separate area codes for cell phones and digital pagers _
the new area codes would be assigned to the new wireless phone
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Is that sensible or what?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Sen. Bowen, you go, girl. For the first time in decades,
California has a solution to its area code problem that's easy as
1-2-3.
</P>

LUCENT GROUP LOOKS WITHIN FOR IDEAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time Stephen Socolof stood before a roomful of Harvard
Business School students, he had just braved a howling blizzard on
a drive from New Hampshire. Harried and snow-coated, the MBA
student from Dartmouth's Tuck school burst into a waiting room to
interview with a hot consulting firm. His Harvard rivals were
neatly pressed, sitting in silence, staring at him.
</P>
<P>
   How the roles have reversed.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Harvard MBA class is going to school on Socolof's
work. He is a partner and vice president of Lucent Technologies
Inc.'s New Ventures Group, a $200 million-plus portfolio of
business ideas culled from the brainy depths of Bell Laboratories.
He visited the school last month to hear students discuss a case
study on the operation, which is seen as one of the best examples
of ``corporate venturing'' among US firms.
</P>
<P>
   The Lucent group is an incubator for more than a dozen
early-stage businesses. Many would never have seen the light of day
without this new focus, started in 1997. Bell Labs claims four new
patents a day, but ideas can wither inside a giant company.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year after Lucent's spinoff from AT&AMP;T, there was a
move to shed the phone-company culture and to become more
entrepreneurial. As venture capital and the IPO market took off,
Lucent didn't want to miss opportunities lurking within its very
walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to emulate the Silicon Valley model inside Lucent,''
Socolof said during his recent visit to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the group tried outside venture deals while also
mining ideas from Bell Labs. That didn't work, Socolof said; the
attention still darted outside. So the efforts were separated.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent started Palo Alto, Calif.-based Lucent Venture Partners
Inc. It invests in classic venture deals through a $100 million
fund and is expected to launch a second fund soon.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Socolof's group zoomed in on Lucent's home-grown
technologies, and results quickly followed. The group spawned a
digital radio company, half of which was sold to outside investors.
Other innovations involve electronic fingerprinting, analysis of
huge volumes of phone calls, and faster 911 responses by police and
fire departments.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the ventures have been acquired by Lucent itself. None
has gone public yet, but Socolof hopes to deliver an IPO by the end
of the year _ a development that makes the group more financially
important to Murray Hill, N.J.-based Lucent than the top brass ever
dreamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure our companies are ready to stand up on
our own,'' Socolof said. ``We'll end up with a large part of (the
stock) after the public offering.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without an IPO, the new venture unit has produced a
triple-digit return in three years, Socolof said. That's better
than his goal of returning an average 20 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for big returns is a huge draw for corporations
that wade into VC, said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, the Harvard Business
School professor and innovation expert whose class studied Lucent's
venture program.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon goes in cycles, she explained, based largely on
the health of the IPO market (because IPOs are typically the exit
strategy for VC investors). Intel Corp. is a big participant now,
as are scores of computer makers, media conglomerates, and
industrial companies.
</P>
<P>
   Companies supplied $7.3 billion to entrepreneurs last year, or
15 percent of the total $48.3 billion of venture financings in
1999, according to Venture Economics. That's up from $1.3 billion,
or 7 percent of the total, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   During the late 1960s and early 1970s, lots of big companies
jumped into venture investing, Kanter explained. But when the IPO
market dried up in 1973, so did the venture capital. Things heated
up again in the 1980s, but they evaporated after the '87 crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I love about the new economy is that no one
has any memory of anything that's ever happened before,'' Kanter
said. ``Companies are going public earlier, faster. But that
doesn't mean that you don't have to manage some of the same
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Kanter said, it was popular to discuss why
corporate venturing doesn't work. While companies can make big
money and get closer to new technologies, venture capital tends to
run counter to the big-company culture.
</P>
<P>
   In times of vast technology booms, like we're experiencing now
with the Internet, telecommunications, and software, Kanter said,
big companies want to invest in promising innovations. But often,
she said, the bureaucracy creeps back in: ``The mainstream of the
business starts rebelling. . . . These entrepreneurs break the
rules and get to have so much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Socolof and his partners are working to avoid those
pitfalls. They've spent time getting top executives to buy into
their mission. They're imposing financial discipline on their
upstarts. Even so, various units of Lucent are trying to be more
innovative, in a sense competing with New Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, she said, corporate venturing is ``a piece of a
bigger change process.'' And that's good for business.

SAN DIEGO SIZES THINGS UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They think big in San Diego and vicinity. Here, from the San
Diego Visitors &AMP; Convention Bureau, are some of the sunny area's
claims to largeness:
</P>
<P>
   --The opulent Hotel del Coronado on Coronado Island is the
largest wooden structure in the United States. (The Del itself
merely says it is ``probably one of the largest wooden structures
in the United States.'')
</P>
<P>
   --The world's largest outdoor pipe organ is at the 2,400-seat
Spreckels Organ Pavilion in Balboa Park.
</P>
<P>
   --The Birch Aquarium at Scripps in La Jolla is the largest
oceanographic museum in the country. The aquarium has 33 tanks,
including a two-story, 70,000-gallon kelp forest. A living tidepool
is outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   --San Diego is home to the largest military complex in the
world.
</P>

PROMINENT BLACK SCHOLARS JOIN PUSH FOR REPARATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move that could take the issue of paid reparations for
American slavery from the fringes of black political debate into
the mainstream civil rights agenda, a group of prominent black
academics are looking into a possible class-action lawsuit on
behalf of the descendants of those injured by slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Law School professor Charles Ogletree, Harvard
Afro-American Studies Department Head Henry Louis Gates, and many
others of the country's top black intellectuals say they are
considering legal and legislative action to secure reparations for
the descendants of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups, such as Japanese-Americans interned during World
War II, have turned to the courts to right historical wrongs. And
activists since Emancipation have argued that America should be
made to pay for the horrors it visited upon its first black
residents. But until now, the issue has largely been championed by
isolated lower-level political leaders and left-wing activists, and
the country's potential debt for slavery has not been tested in the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at what's the viability of legal action and
political viability of legislative action and then more morally how
can we get beyond the history of slavery to think of ways to
comprehensively remedy it,'' Ogletree said.
</P>
<P>
   Gates said he is planning to ask the board of the Harvard's
W.E.B Du Bois Institute to examine the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics, though, worried that an organized demand for
payment, whether in the form of a lawsuit or federal legislation,
would be so divisive that it could set back race relations at a
time when blacks are overcoming some of the social and economic
disadvantages of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with some of the policies that are being discussed,''
said Kwame Anthony Appiah, also a professor at Harvard University
and a board member of the Du Bois Institute. But ``guilt tripping
on a whole is not an effective way to make political policies
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   And some legal scholars questioned whether Ogletree and others
would be able to successfully sue so long after the events, with
all of the direct victims long since dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference between the people actually enslaved and
those bringing the lawsuit,'' said Jules Coleman, a professor at
Yale Law School. ``The question is: Would the courts recognize the
latter?''
</P>
<P>
   But Harvard-trained attorney Randall Robinson, who helped
rekindle interest in the idea of reparations with his book ``The
Debt: What America Owes Blacks,'' said slavery is a human rights
crime dating from the day Africans were first forcibly brought to
the colonies until 1965, after voting rights act was passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not just talking about slavery but the century of
discrimination that followed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said the 40 race riots, 4,700 or more lynchings, as
well as more institutional discrimination such as redlining _ all,
he argues, extensions of slavery _ have accounted for an estimated
$1.4 trillion loss in wealth for African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no surprise that blacks are on a whole poorer than
whites,'' Robinson, a leader in the fight against South African
apartheid, said. ``The genesis in the poverty gap can be found in
slavery and sustained by laws.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, demands for reparations have never gained much
political currency. Former Massachusetts state senator Bill Owens
repeatedly demanded reparations be paid to blacks _ while others,
including some black political opponents in his own district,
argued that the cause was fruitless and emblematic of an outmoded
'60s style of activism.
</P>
<P>
   But rap group Public Enemy wrote songs about reparations,
bringing the cause into the college-radio scene. And John Conyers,
a US Representative from Detroit, has been trying in vain to push a
reparations bill in Congress for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Now, said Conyers, ``It is coming out of the eccentric phase and
being considered something that really ought to be given serious
scrutiny and examination.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, Robinson called a number of well-known scholars from
the nation's top schools as well as mainstream civil rights leaders
to discuss the issue in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who attended the meeting and are now joining
Ogletree were Dorothy Height, director of the National Council of
Negro Women; actor Danny Glover; and political consultant Ronald
Walters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any question they have given this issue
new altitude,'' said Robinson of the academics. ``I think there is
a broader consensus than assumed in the black community.''
</P>
<P>
   If the effort moves forward, though, it's not clear what its
proponents would demand. They could ask for a cash settlement of
some kind, but, more likely, said Robinson, they would ask for
broader programs to help blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agreed that a legal case would be daunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is the court route is the rougher route because the
US government has to allow itself to be sued, before we can pursue
it,'' said Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   And the case, said some, might even involve other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I advocate European and American governments engaged in the
slave trade to forgive debt for all African Nations and, secondly,
subsidizing drug-related treatment for HIV positive (black)
victims,'' said Gates.
</P>
<P>
   But Ogletree said his goal is not to make individuals rich but
to close the book on one of the most painful chapters in American
and European history.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a situation of someone sitting at the mailbox
waiting for a check, that trivializes the broad purpose,'' said
Ogletree. ``The real point is to put closure to a very sorry period
in our history.''

EVERETT GUIDED BY HIS RIGHT TO PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Ballplayers. Fans want to watch them. Fans
want to know about them. As your humble servants, it's our job to
tell you about them. But how much do you want to know? And how deep
are we obligated to dig?
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have a new center fielder and we know so little
about him. Carl Everett seems like a nice-enough young man. He's
friendly with teammates, cooperates with reporters, signs
autographs for fans, and does a nice job at the plate and in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   There's a four-page biography of Everett in the Sox 2000 press
guide. The bio is jammed with facts, stats, and minutia. It tells
you that Carl hit .325 with 25 homers, 108 RBIs and 27 steals with
the Astros last year. It tells you that Carl went to the same Tampa
High School as Dwight Gooden and Gary Sheffield and that he rushed
for 948 yards as a senior running back. It also tells you that he
weighs 190 pounds, which is 30 pounds less than he actually weighs.
</P>
<P>
   ``One ninety was my rookie ball weight,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing in the bio about the fact that Everett was a
catcher in high school and ran a 10.3 100. It doesn't tell you that
he loves to draw and hates to smile for photographs.
</P>
<P>
   And there's no mention of Carl's family.
</P>
<P>
   Family history is usually part of a player's press guide bio. It
is in the press guide that we learn that Scott Hatteberg's wife
goes by ``Bitsy.''
</P>
<P>
   The guide was the best way to keep things straight when dealing
with Kody, Kory, Koby, and Kacy Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   But the Everett bio offers no mention of wife, Linda, or his
five children.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my request,'' Everett said, sitting in front of his
locker after a workout at the Sox minor league complex.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox acquired Everett from Houston for minor-leaguers
Adam Everett and Greg Miller last December. Boston then signed the
28-year-old switch-hitter to a three-year, $21 million contract.
He's never played a game in Fenway Park, but has already been
annointed Boston's best center fielder since Fred Lynn. Everett's
bat is supposed to provide punch and protection for Nomar
Garciaparra in the heart of the Boston batting order. He's a
multi-tool player with Earl Campbell thighs and his presence has
some fans thinking the Sox might be able to overtake the mighty
Yankees this season.
</P>
<P>
   Do we need to know about his family situation? Is it anybody's
business that Everett and his wife lost custody of two of his
children when he was an outfielder with the Mets in 1997? And is
Everett under any obligation to explain any of this as long as he
does his job and obeys the law?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a private family and that's what I think a lot of
people don't like,'' said Everett. ``I think everyone feels
violated, when you're here to play baseball and other things like
that try to interfere with it. I just overlook those people. I give
'em their opinion, they can say what they want to say, continue to
be whom they are, I don't worry about it. It's over.''
</P>
<P>
   In August 1997, a child-care provider at Shea Stadium expressed
concern about bruises on Shawna and Carl IV, who were 4 and 5,
respectively. The children were put in city custody and the
Everetts went to Queens family court which ruled that Linda Everett
(who is Shawna's stepmother) used ``excessive corporal punishment''
and that Carl Everett ``failed to take appropriate action.'' The
court ordered the Everetts to parenting classes and mental health
evaluations. Carl IV was eventually returned to his parents. Shawna
went to live with a grandmother, and Everett is evasive when asked
if he has regained custody of his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's in Tampa,'' he said. ``Everybody's home in Tampa. We're
gonna end that. It's over with. I don't worry about it. That's
water under the bridge. I don't worry about that anymore. It's over
with and my kids are safe, that's all I care about.''
</P>
<P>
   Every family has issues. Here in the sports department, it seems
like a good idea to let families of athletes keep their problems
private as long as they're not missing games because they're in
court. Red Sox outfielder Wilfredo Cordero was run out of town
after beating his wife a few summers ago. Drew Bledsoe, Max Lane,
and Scott Zolak made news when a young woman was hurt on the night
they were stage-diving at the Paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Everett is entitled to his privacy. He just wants to play ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Houston it was fine,'' he said. ``Houston doesn't look for
stuff like that. Houston takes you as a player. That's what you

opinion about things, so you just go ahead and let 'em do it. I
don't worry about how people think about me.''

FREE SPEECH OR CYBER-SLANDER? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cyberspace has become less anonymous as companies use libel
suits to find and unmask their online critics, but now some
cyber-chatters are fighting back.
</P>
<P>
   The chatters claim a First Amendment right to post messages on
electronic bulletin boards using pseudonyms. They have scored some
success in challenging attempts to pry loose their identities from
Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   The legal battle may alter the balance of power on the Web as
chatters try to extend a tradition, dating back to the Federalist
Papers of 1787, which respects unsigned opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet never before has anonymity applied to an arena as broad as
the Internet, where commercial interests are swamping the network's
libertarian roots.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, public figures and companies such as Raytheon
Co. and Stone &AMP; Webster Inc. have gone to court to clamp down on
bulletin boards featuring detailed talk about their conduct, chat
they allege often veers beyond opinion into libel, slander or the
disclosure of inside information. The suits also are embarrassing
for Internet companies such as Yahoo Inc. and America Online, which
advertise themselves as forums for free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Now legal experts think a series of recent lawsuits may create
some guidance for how much anonymity users really should expect
when using fictitious screen names.
</P>
<P>
   One of the broadest cases is pending in a Florida state court,
where a former shipping executive wants to know who wrote certain
e-mails that he says cost him his job.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the authors deny wrongdoing and say they have the right
to speak their minds on public message boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a test of the capacity of ordinary people to make full
use of the Internet,'' said Lyrissa Lidsky, a University of Florida
law school professor who helped write a friend-of-the-court brief
filed in the case by the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   Too many claims of online libel are really just attempts to
squelch dissent, says the ACLU, which suggests courts should
postpone discovery motions in these cases unless plaintiffs can
prove that messages actually were defamatory or malicious.
</P>
<P>
   But the plaintiff's attorneys, Bruce Fischman and David Harris,
say such changes would make it too hard to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you go into court, you're entitled to know who
you're suing,'' Fischman said. ``It goes to your strategy and it
goes to whether you think you'll be able to settle.'' Only those
who post irresponsible or malicious comments on the Web should fear
having their names revealed, he said, a position he feels is in
keeping with the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing on the case is scheduled for May, and the outcome
could have a deep impact on the tone of chat online, said Fred
Schauer, a First Amendment specialist at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   If it becomes easier for plaintiffs to learn online users'
identities, Schauer said, e-mail writers might take more care in
their statements. But overall Internet use also could decline if
users fear their off-the-cuff statements could come back to haunt
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a policy decision,'' Schauer said. ``We have to figure
out how to balance the volume (of words carried on the Internet)
with its potential to transmit a lot of very specific information,
some of which may not be true.''
</P>
<P>
   The Florida case was brought by Erik Hvide, former chief
executive of Hvide Marine Inc. He sued eight anonymous chatters
after leaving the top job last summer for what the company at the
time described as ``personal reasons.'' The company later declared
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   But in a Feb. 18 court filing, Hvide says he was fired because
of ``malicious and intolerable defamatory statements'' made on a
Yahoo message board by a group of chatters known only by screen
names such as ``justthefactsjack'' and ``THE 1 Quiz.''
</P>
<P>
   His complaint cites messages like one written by somebody known
as ``THE 1 Quiz,'' who wrote that if the company kept Erik Hvide
employed, ``(T)he directors are or could be at the minimum exposing
themselves to being Guilty of Negligence, Failure to supervise,
malfeasance and a Total Disregard for the Shareholder.'' Such
comments unfairly ``imputed a crime or moral delinquency,'' states
Hvide's complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Hvide wants unspecified damages from the chatters and seeks to
learn their real identities from Internet service companies,
demands they have routinely answered in the past. But this time,
Yahoo and America Online are holding off pending the outcome of
motions to quash the subpoenas by several of the John Does.
</P>
<P>
   The motions were filed by Fort Lauderdale attorney Christopher
Leigh, who argues the chat was well within bounds for a publicly
traded company and its top executive. ``This Court should not
permit the judicial branch to become a clearinghouse for lawsuits
filed only with the most frivolous pretense'' in order to expose
critics, Leigh wrote in a filing.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, courts rarely have allowed defendants to remain
anonymous except in cases involving minors or sexual abuse. But
courts also have recognized certain forms of anonymous speech.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU cites a 1995 decision in which the US Supreme Court
ruled unconstitional an Ohio law that prohibited anonymous
literature in political campaigns. ``Under our constitution,
anonymous pamphleteering is not a pernicious, fraudulent practice
but an honorable tradition of advocacy and dissent,'' wrote a
majority of justices. They noted cases throughout American history
when people have felt threatened for speaking the truth, and have
omitted their names from publications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority,'' the
court wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Some say that means citizens should have broad latitude to post
anonymous comments on the Internet as well. ``Having the freedom to
be wrong, in a public place, is important and should be
encouraged,'' said Megan Gray, a Los Angeles lawyer specializing in
Internet issues.
</P>
<P>
   A similar argument has found traction in Pittsburgh, where a
person known as ``grantst99,'' presumably after the city's Grant
Street, so far has convinced a judge to block a subpoena filed by
another judge, Joan Melvin, as part of her defamation suit. Melvin
alleges a Web site maintained by the defendant included the false
charge she lobbied on behalf of another judicial appointee, which
could violate state ethics codes.
</P>
<P>
   Vic Walczak, grantst99's lawyer, said the charge is accurate and
that Melvin should have to prove otherwise before obtaining the
writer's identity. ``Initially, the court has an obligation to
apply some scrutiny to ensure that it's not just a frivolous case
designed to out the Webmaster,'' Walczak said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Walczak and his allies may face an uphill battle. In
Columbus, Ohio, a judge this month ruled against a person who tried
to block a subpeona issued by Stone &AMP; Webster Inc. to track down
one of the people it says defamed the company or disclosed inside
information. (The action stems from a lawsuit Stone &AMP; Webster
brought in Suffolk Superior Court last year, which remains
pending.) One of these people, a CompuServe user, argued he had a
right to remain nameless, though it isn't clear exactly which
disputed messages this person authored.
</P>
<P>
   But on Feb. 7, Judge Alvin C. Travis denied the motion because
the user had ``no reasonable expection of privacy'' under
agreements with CompuServe, which has since identified the user to
Stone &AMP; Webster. The chatter doesn't appear to be an employee of
Stone &AMP; Webster, said its attorney, William Zucker, who adds the
company hasn't decided whether to seek damages.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was still worthwhile, Zucker said, in part because it
seems to have discouraged the further disclosure of sensitive
materials online. ``Companies, even when they're undergoing times
of stress, have an obligation to protect'' confidential material,
Zucker said. ``This isn't a vendetta.''

THE E-PAPER CHASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Imagine that the newspaper you are now
holding is digital. After reading it, you place it on the breakfast
table until tomorrow morning, when it will be automatically,
wirelessly updated with a fresh batch of stories.
</P>
<P>
   Except it's not really paper; it's ``electronic paper'' embedded
with ``electronic ink.''
</P>
<P>
   That scenario is not as futuristic as it may seem. Two companies
_ eInk Corp. in Cambridge, Mass. and Xerox Corp. in Palo Alto _ are
racing to deliver the next-generation publishing medium to
consumers. Each has made significant steps toward that goal,
although both acknowledge that a marketable product may not be
available for years. But with billions spent annually in the
publishing and display markets, the payoff could be huge.
</P>
<P>
   On the West Coast is the fabled Xerox Palo Alto Research Center,
known as Xerox PARC, the laboratory that invented laser printing;
the ethernet; and the point-and-click, menu-driven graphics common
to computer software.
</P>
<P>
   On the East Coast is eInk, a small start-up founded by a
professor and two students from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's Media Lab, whose whacky, wearable inventions have a
penchant for grabbing headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the e-paper chase. The prize: electronic paper that
looks and feels like its paper cousin but can morph from ``War and
Peace'' to ``Anna Karenina'' at the click of a button.
Theoretically, an e-paper book can store an entire library on a
computer installed in its spine.
</P>
<P>
   The market potential is more than just books, however. It's
electronic magazines and newspapers that can be regularly updated,
price tags that can be instantly changed by remote control to
reflect a sale, and, eventually, displays that will pop up on all
sorts of electronic gadgets, even smart ``wallpaper'' that can
change patterns to match a room's decor.
</P>
<P>
   The race is being keenly followed by several giant companies,
including Hearst Corp., Lucent Technologies, 3M Co., and Motorola
Inc., all of which have either backed the projects financially or
have entered into technical partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   While the ultimate goal of the contest _ the electronic book or
newspaper _ now seems within reach, analysts are skeptical that it
will ever completely replace the world of paper and ink.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't expect paper and ink to go away anytime soon,''
said Matthew Harrigan, senior vice president and media analyst at
Seisel, Nicolaus, Hanifen, Imhoff in Denver. ``It's going to be a
complementary technology. The notion that this is a huge
replacement of newspaper may be overzealous.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, other analysts see greater potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's exciting,'' said Charlene Li, an analyst with
Forrester Research in Cambridge. ``It allows paper to be
interactive.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts also point out that publishers can distribute
their content to e-books over the Internet or wireless radio waves,
saving on printing and distribution costs. For newspaper
publishers, e-paper could solve the two biggest reader complaints:
inky fingers and old newspapers that pile up.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the basic technology of both companies works:
</P>
<P>
   Sandwiched between sheets of clear, flexible plastic are
ultra-thin transistors that direct billions of tiny black and white
balls to arrange themselves in ways that would display letters or
pictures. Think of hundreds of people at a Patriots game holding up
black-and-white placards that spell a slogan or form a team logo.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between Xerox and eInk lies in the ping pong-like
balls. Xerox's ``ePaper'' project has created balls, each measuring
one-tenth of a millimeter, that are exactly half black, half white.
The balls rotate, displaying either black or white depending on the
electric charge being applied.
</P>
<P>
   eInk's product involves similarly sized, transparent spheres
containing black oil and dozens of tiny white beads that, through
an electric charge, either float to create a white image, or
submerge to appear dark.
</P>
<P>
   Looked at another way, e-paper is just another mode for
displaying text, like a computer screen. But the advantages of
digital paper over the liquid crystal displays, or LCDs, used in
computer screens are numerous, says Jim Iuliano, chief executive of
eInk.
</P>
<P>
   The first is power consumption. LCDs must be fed with a
continuous power source; turn off the power and the display
disappears. Digital paper requires power only when it is changing
its display, consuming 50 to 100 times less power than LCDs,
according to Iuliano.
</P>
<P>
   The second advantage is that e-paper is a lot easier on the eyes
than LCDs, which constantly blast viewers with light. LCDs are made
with expensive, heavy, breakable glass whose properties limit the
size of the screen. Digital paper, on the other hand, can be
lightweight and shatterproof, and it can be manufactured by the
mile in the same way paper is made into rolls.
</P>
<P>
   It will probably take at least five years before either Xerox or
eInk will cross the finish line and create commercially viable
electronic paper. Both companies say there are major hurdles ahead
that they are feverishly trying to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   One obvious challenge is to come up with full-color displays.
Right now, the technology can accommodate just two colors at any
one time. Xerox is is working on ``subtractive color,'' a
technology that involves multicolored beads that when mixed could
create a full-color spectrum. eInk is working on a method that
mimics the technology in liquid crystal displays.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem for both companies is making the spheres even
smaller to improve the resolution. At 100 microns in diameter, the
current size that can be economically achieved by both companies,
the balls create an image of about 100 dots per inch. At 50
microns, the resolution improves to 200 dots per inch or better. By
comparison, a typical liquid crystal computer screen has a
resolution of about 70 dots per inch.
</P>
<P>
   A final, broad set of issues revolves around the manufacturing
process, according to Pierre Wiltzius, a researcher at Lucent's
Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, N.J., eInk's technology partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we think all the elements are there, we are now in the
stage of taking this out of the lab environment and trying to turn
it into real technology that can be mass produced,'' Wiltzius said.
``It's a bigger step than you might think.''
</P>
<P>
   Who will win the race?
</P>
<P>
   Although Xerox had a head start, eInk is rapidly catching up.
And both have formidable resources.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox, for example, has Nicholas Sheridon, the ``father of
e-paper,'' a 64-year-old physicist who in the mid-1970s invented
the black-and-white spheres and holds several dozen patents on the
process. It also has a $19.4 billion annual revenue stream and an
exclusive manufacturing agreement with 3M.
</P>
<P>
   The project, which once counted just Sheridon and an assistant,
now has ``considerably more'' scientists working on it, said
Sheridon, who said the exact count and the money Xerox has spent on
the project is proprietary.
</P>
<P>
   When it's done, Xerox is aiming to produce 8.5-by-11-inch sheets
of paper with the thickness of glossy magazine paper for $5 a page,
and a device costing about $100 that can hold up to 10 full-size
books and transfer its content onto the page.
</P>
<P>
   eInk got its start in 1995, when Joseph Jacobson, an MIT
professor working at the school's Media Lab (whose scientists have
come up with computerized jackets and shoes), hired several
students to work on developing an electronic book.
</P>
<P>
   Two of his students, J.D. Albert and Barrett Comiskey, came up
with the microcapsules after they had trouble reproducing
Sheridon's work. The two formed eInk in April 1997, two months
before they graduated from MIT.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the company has raised $52.8 million from 19 companies,
including Motorola in Schaumburg, Ill., The Hearst Corp. in New
York, Atlas Venture in Boston, Cabot Corp. in Boston, and the
Vivendi Group in France. In October, eInk formed a technology
partnership with Lucent, which is developing ultra-thin, flexible
transistors that can be ``microprinted'' to control the electronic
ink.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has allowed eInk to be the first to introduce a
commercial product, the Immedia advertising display, which has been
used by Yahoo Inc. and in test stores owned by J.C. Penney and
Eckerd Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The boards, which measure 4 feet by 3 feet, aren't cheap,
costing $1,000 or more per sign. In November, Yahoo used eInk's
technology in creating sandwich boards promoting Yahoo online
shopping services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sandwich boards allowed us to reach people where they
shopped,'' said LuAnne Calvert, a brand marketer at Yahoo. ``It
definitely caught people's attention. It was so unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem: The signs could not operate in freezing
temperatures and had to be moved from Chicago to Dallas after
several weeks. ``We had anticipated that,'' Calvert said.
</P>
<P>
   Cold temperatures aside, there are plenty of other wrinkles to
be ironed out to keep eInk and Xerox busy for at least five more
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about some pretty far-out technologies,'' said
Alan Alper, an analyst at Gomez Advisors in Lincoln Mass. ``It's a
matter of being able to get it there in a cost-effective, foolproof
way. But the intrinsic business value is definitely there.''

INVESTORS SEE REASONS TO FLEE AOL-TIME WARNER DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON AND HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even though the planned deal between America Online Inc. and
Time Warner Inc. is still firmly on track, a lot of investors have
chosen to hop off the train.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner shares spiked upward on news of the deal, but have
lost a good portion of those gains. And AOL shares have fallen off
sharply. Even last week's strong upturn, spurred by a positive
report from a major Wall Street analyst, hasn't brought AOl back to
its premerger price.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's stock was trading at 73 3/4 before the deal was announced
on Jan. 10; last Tuesday it had fallen to 49 5/8. Time Warner
soared from 64 3/4 to 92 1/4 on Jan. 10, but had slipped back to 73
9/16 last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Blodget, the respected Internet analyst for Merrill Lynch,
came to the rescue on Wednesday. Blodget issued a hefty report
hailing the AOL-Time Warner merger and urging investors to buy both
companies' shares.
</P>
<P>
   The report predicted the combined company will benefit from the
Internet's impact on the global media and communications
industries, as well as the development of consumer interactive
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would own the stock if for no other reason than this,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   The vote of confidence caused a substantial rally in AOL shares,
which closed Friday at 59 5/8. Time Warner ended the week at 84.
Both trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that puts AOL 20 percent below its predeal price.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's stock has been hammered partly because many investors who
thought they held shares in a high-flying Internet company fled
after discovering they would own part of a slower-growing media
company burdened with debt.
</P>
<P>
   Other investors are still raising questions about how to value
such a giant hybrid company and whether there will be long-term
benefits from the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of (AOL investors) are voting with their feet,'' said
James Waggoner, an analyst with the investment firm Sands Brothers
&AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Waggoner has been a vocal critic of the deal. America Online, he
said, will surely benefit by absorbing Time Warner's content and
revenue stream. But he argues that AOL investors would fare better
_ and the same corporate goals would be accomplished _ if the two
companies had opted for a joint venture instead of a merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The AOL shareholders will be asked to carry the ball and chain
of the Time Warner debt and the much slower growth of the combined
companies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As AOL becomes less of a fast-paced start-up technology firm and
more of an old-guard company with slower growth, it also may have
trouble retaining and attracting employees, some analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The possibility of a brain drain is real,'' said Pat Dorsey,
an analyst with Morningstar Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But the retention problem is widespread in the technology
industry, as employees abandon older firms for the chance to make
it rich with stock ownership in upstart companies.
</P>
<P>
   Most industry observers agree that the proposed union is
unlikely to be abandoned by either party. But it's not a done deal
until the last paper is signed, one analyst said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt that both parties want the deal to get done,''
said Scott Davis, an analyst with Schroder &AMP; Co. in New York. ``But
I don't think you can say the risk is zero that the deal won't go
through.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts last month, Michael Kelly,
AOL's chief financial officer, sought to allay fears about the
deal. He said the combined company's earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation, and amortization would be 30 percent in 2001.
That growth rate would put the merged company in line with large
technology firms like Microsoft Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly we are confident in our ability to drive superior
results,'' Kelly told analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say it would take much more than plummeting stock
prices for Time Warner or AOL to shelve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, neither side demanded back-out clauses in
the event that company shares hit a minimum price. And there are
stiff penalties for ending the engagement. AOL would have to pay a
$5.4 billion breakup fee. If Time Warner ditched AOL, it would owe
$3.9 billion. Both companies can walk away from the deal if it's
not consummated by May 31, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an indication that both side are saying, `We're going
to go ahead and do this thing,' '' analyst Dorsey said.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado-based Janus Capital Corp., the biggest
institutional shareholder in both companies, strongly supports the
deal, according to assistant portfolio manager John Schreiber.
</P>
<P>
   ``The logic behind the merger is impeccable,'' said Schreiber.
``The combination of the two companies will create a media
powerhouse the likes of which the world has never seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Schreiber blamed the declining stock price on ``uneducated
institutional money fleeing both the Time Warner and AOL sides
because they couldn't figure out how to value the company.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that AOL attracts many individual investors who
also have sold shares out of confusion about the deal. By contrast,
Time Warner has a higher proportion of institutional holders
willing to hang on for the ride. Schreiber said that this explains
why AOL stock fell further than Time Warner's in recent weeks.

   &UR;  &LR; He graduated from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
1970 with a degree in earth sciences and mathematics. Then

Indian Health Service in Arizona, to cancel the debt.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, he practiced medicine, then moved into management.
In 1985 he founded Healthsource, a health maintenance organization
based in Hooksett serving rural New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years later, fueled by a string of acquisitions of
physicians' practices financed on Wall Street, Healthsource had
sales of $1.7 billion and operations in 15 states.

August 1997, Payson cashed out with $94 million.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, he was back, this time as chief executive of
Oxford Health Plans, a publicly owned firm which is one of biggest
managed care companies in the Northeast, with more than 2 million

a fire-sale price _ put in $350 million, expecting to own 22
percent of Oxford. Payson put in $10 million of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Oxford is in much better shape, selling at
about $16 a share. Payson closed several unprofitable lines of
business, raised premiums on the rest, and spent heavily on new
information systems. Doctors in particular praised the turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Payson is the human face of for-profit health care _ one
human face, anyway. Oxford is among the potential investors who
have expressed an interest in Harvard Pilgrim health plan. I have
no way of knowing whether he is seriously interested, but I'd be
very surprised if he were not.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly, who is
overseeing the receivership of the troubled HMO, says he thinks
Harvard Pilgrim needs something like $238 million in order to
continue operations.
</P>
<P>
   At a certain point in the deliberations Friday, one wag
suggested: Why not just reorganize, capitalize the Harvard name as
an asset, and recognize it on the balance sheet?
</P>
<P>
   That, plus the sale of some $150 million in real estate, might
improve matters to the point that the HMO could resume operating
without state protection from its creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, there will be no such accounting sleight-of-hand. Nor
apparently is Harvard University going to help the ailing
Harvard-Pilgrim organization, despite having blown life into it 30
years ago and having semi-governed it until it got into trouble.
That was then, this is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that . . . the university is somehow responsible for
the bailout is just a nonstarter,'' Harvard's vice president for
public relations Paul Grogan told The Boston Globe's Richard Knox.
``We have no corporate affiliation with Harvard Pilgrim. We're not
responsible for its condition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're deeply concerned, as are many employers, and want to
help. Somehow that has been construed in a way that's very
unrealistic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Reilly told the Globe that Harvard ``hasn't shown any
degree of seriousness to helping in a substantive way'' to resolve
the impasse. He called the university's insistence that any loans
it made be guaranteed by the state ``preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's teaching hospitals _ Massachusetts General, Brigham
and Women's, and Beth Israel chief among them _ are independently
chartered and not owned by the university. But they owe their power
and prestige to their affiliation with it, share power with the
Harvard Medical School, and, in several cases, have substantial
endowments of their own. The hospitals are said to have demanded a
return to state rate-setting as a condition for their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's options seem to boil down to two:
</P>
<P>
   Call the bluff of the hospitals, persuading them to accept some
manner of debt rescheduling, at the same time seeking state loan
guarantees to provide some fresh money. A mandatory increase in
reserve requirements for other HMOs, Harvard-Pilgrim, presumably
would require premium increases sufficient to return Harvard
Pilgrim to good health.
</P>
<P>
   Or sell it _ to a willing buyer like Payson.

MONTANA GUIDE'S FORTE IS THE ROAD LESS TAKEN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   So, you want to see the real West, and you may be looking for an
authentic alternative to the Alaska Inside Passage cruise.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is to seek a specialist _ one who knows the
territory, loves it, and wants to share it with visitors. Bill
Bryan is that type of person.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Maine, he's been leading Off The Beaten Path for
more than 15 years. The company (27 East Main St., Bozeman, MT
59715; telephone 406-586-1311; or www.offthebeatenpath.com) has
been specializing in the Rockies and the Southwest, now Alaska and
also Patagonia, way down in Chile and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   As Bryan notes in the company brochure, ``We are the friends you
wish you had here, who will steer you to the remarkable places that
make these regions so appealing.'' Off The Beaten Path runs
organized but small tours, will customize a vacation, and even
provide personal travel consulting. While you pay for these
services, what you get in return is the vacation experience of a
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Yellowstone, the Canadian Rockies, Wyoming, Colorado, Glacier
National Park, undiscovered vacation spots, real ranch vacations,
authentic Alaska _ whatever your vision is of the West or Alaska,
seeking out people like Bryan may be the way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus is on the realization that the traveler wants to be
an `insider,' not a tourist,'' says Bryan. ``And, at the same time,
the Western traveler wants a quality experience that has a
learning/educational element and is rooted in authenticity. We are
also seeing more family adventures in authentic and learning
environments. We are seeing more families coming on trips to the
West that involve a variety of activities. And we're seeing the
rise of families wanting to go on small group trips with other
families.''
</P>
<P>
   The company started with sizable fees, which met some resistance
at the outset, Bryant says. But Off The Beaten Path has not only
become acceptable, it is well known throughout the specialty travel
business, and with travel agents.

<P>
   Looking for some gardens that are open to the public? ``The
Garden Conservancy's Open Days Directory: The Guide to Visiting
Hundreds of America's Best Private Gardens'' (Abrams, $14.95)
offers gardens that are open to the public on select weekend days
from March through October. This year 17 new cities were added to
the book, including destinations in New Hampshire and Long Island's
North Shore. The book can be ordered ($14.95 plus $3.50 shipping)
by writing to the Garden Conservancy, PO Box 219, Cold Spring, NY

<P>
   Safety first &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jiminy Peak in Hancock, Mass. is going all out to reduce
accidents and provide a more enjoyable environment for skiers. The
most visible safety effort is the creation of non-speed zones where
skiers and snowboarders are required to keep at the average speed
of the users of that particular slope. On the seven trails marked,
Mountain Safety Patrol members will be giving tickets to those who
violate the rules. Consistent violators will lose their lift ticket
but get an opportunity to redeem it by watching a mountain safety
video. The safety patrol is a volunteer organization with 40
members (very visible in their bright yellow jackets) that started
five years ago. For more information, check out

   If you'd like to spend your summer reading and discussing great
works of literature, philosophy, and the opera, take off for Santa
Fe. Each summer St. John's College, nationally recognized as the
great books school, offers a unique educational experience in a
small group, seminar-style setting. The Summer Classics is a series

DURANGO DELIGHTS CAPTURE A FAMILY OF THREE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NATHAN COBB  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURANGO, Colo. _ Return to Durango. It sounds like a 1950s
western directed by John Ford. Starring Henry Fonda. In
Cinemascope.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not a movie. It's part of a six-week trip through the
American West, starring our family of three and a rented Buick. We
first visited this part of southwestern Colorado seven years ago,
and vowed to return. So when we were laying out our 6,500-mile
itinerary, we made certain it included this former mining town of
15,000 souls, even though coming here would require me to motor
through the San Juan Mountains with my eyes closed _ in the back
seat. More about that later.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what I especially like about Durango. Although it's
clearly a tourist town, especially during summer and fall, it's
also the real Western deal. It has art galleries populated by
shoppers from Dallas and pool rooms with shooters from down along
the Animas River. It has folks from Illinois who've come to
day-trip on the Durango &AMP; Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad, and
cowboys from New Mexico who are here for the Durango Pro Rodeo
Series. It has RVs bound for nearby Mesa Verde National Park and
horse trailers headed for the nearest stock auctions. It has
brewpubs where visitors raise pints of porter and saloons where
locals nurse near-empty glasses of Coors. And it stages an annual
Cowboy Gathering that features _ yes _ poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting for 15 minutes one afternoon on a green metal bench on
Main Avenue, a National Register Historic District that's laced
with restored Victorian buildings, this is what I saw: a cowpoke
sporting a tattoo that proclaimed him an Enemy of the State, a
portly gent sporting a Kansas City Board of Trade cap, a member of
the Southern Ute Indian Tribe in a Western hat with a perfectly
curved brim, a woman in a Hawaiian-print pantsuit, a teenage girl
in well-scuffed Western boots and a dirty red bandanna, a
horse-drawn carriage hired by a beaming family of four, a quartet
of Harley bikers in all-black gear, a tour bus unloading its brood
in front of the 112-year-old Strater Hotel, and a guy with a Texas
longhorn in his trailer.
</P>
<P>
   The fellow with the steer was Jeff Mannix, a local rancher who
came here via Marblehead, Mass., where he grew up, and Boston
University, from which he graduated in 1966. Mannix is also a
partner in the local rodeo, which is why he sometimes parks a
one-ton bull on Main Avenue. Passersby tend to stop to inspect such
a critter, and when they do Mannix gives them a rodeo flier and
talks up the show. He can also wax rhapsodic about the American
West, about how big everything is, about how ``free'' Durango
feels. ``I can leave town and drive 15 miles down to my ranch and
it's like I'm in Montana,'' he said, grinning. Then he handed out
another flier, urging folks to come see the rodeo tonight.
</P>
<P>
   (Which we did, incidentally. The crowd of about 700 people
included a group of 30 foreigners. When the announcer asked one of
them where they were from and was told Florence, he replied
``France! That's great!'' Whereupon he worked a bit of French into
many of his announcements. Whereupon all 700 of us, locals and
tourists alike, repeatedly hollered ``Italy! Italy!'' at him.)
</P>
<P>
   Durango is nothing if not a great place to be outdoors. The San
Juans, which rise as high as 14,000 feet above sea level, are the
largest range in the Rocky Mountains. The San Juan National Forest,
which contains many of these peaks, consists of some 2 million
acres. Sitting on that bench on Main Avenue, therefore, means
you'll also encounter more than a few hikers, campers, rafters,
bikers, boaters, rock climbers, anglers, hunters, horseback riders,
four-wheelers, kayakers, and, if you wait long enough in the year,
skiiers and snowboarders bound for Purgatory Ski Resort, 25 miles
north of town.
</P>
<P>
   We tried modestly to do our outdoor part during our four-day
stay. We hiked the eight-mile Animas Mountain Trail one morning,
climbing the switchbacks 1,600 feet above the Animas Valley and
town itself to points that are usually covered with deep snow from
November through May. We swam at Trimble Hot Springs, a trio of
pools 6 miles north of town in a neighborhood featuring an
assortment of small farms, a place where the water must be cooled
from its in-ground temperature of 130 degrees. (``It's great here
during a snowstorm,'' a local teenage swimmer advised us.) We
picknicked amid the Ponderosa pine at Vellecito Dam, 20 miles
northeast, and we piloted an alpine slide at Purgatory _ although
at $8 for the three-minute trip, we should have simply ridden the
chairlift up and down the mountain for free.
</P>
<P>
   But there are two things you absolutely must do while in
Durango, whether yours is a return trip or otherwise: Spend at
least a day at Mesa Verde and take a ride on the D &AMP; SNGR.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa Verde, 36 miles west of town and high above the Montezuma
and Mancos valleys, draws about 700,000 visitors a year. Small
wonder. Between AD 600 and 1300, it was home to a remarkable
civilization of some 4,000 Ancestral Puebloans _ people known as
Anasazi the last time we were here, but since renamed in the
interest of their current descendants, many of whom still live in
New Mexico and Arizona. There are a number of stunning cliff
dwellings you can visit at Mesa Verde, following eager park rangers
downward to the remains of elaborate sandstone structures that are
tucked into steep canyon walls. Mysteriously, the residents of
these communities departed their homes forever in the late 1200s,
leaving no written records behind. The ruins were accidentally
rediscovered by cowboys in 1881, and Mesa Verde is now the largest
architectural preserve in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of my wife's favorite places. Margery loves the
mystery of Mesa Verde, loves to stand among the ancient courtyards
and kivas and wonder why people lived here and why they left.
(Prevailing theory regarding the latter: drought.) This time we
spent a night at Far View Lodge, the modest 150-room park hotel
with a 100-mile view and, somewhat to the dismay of our 12-year-old
son, Ethan, no in-room phones or television sets. We visited the
ruins of communities now known as Long House and Cliff Palace,
trekking down steep pathways and climbing up log ladders. We did
not do Balcony House, because I do not do ladders more than 30 feet
long, whether they're in national parks or leaning against my home.
Indeed, when it came time to depart Cliff Palace, I wasn't
especially eager to walk through a narrow rock crevice and ascend a
20-footer near the top of the canyon. ``Would you rather spend the
night here?'' my wife asked. I climbed.
</P>
<P>
   (Margery's Red Hot Mesa Verde Travel Tip: Visit the park's
popular Chapin Mesa Archeological Museum early in the morning or
late in the afternoon, when it's least crowded. When you arrive at
the park, book guided tours of the much-visited Cliff Palace and
Balcony House during the same time periods. Book a tour of Long
House, which is well worth a visit but is not as popular, during
the busy midday.)
</P>
<P>
   But if carving a community out of the side of a cliff is
impressive, what about slicing a railroad out of one? Two days
later I was peering 400 feet straight down at the churning Animas
River, rocking gently in an open gondola car that was being slowly
pulled 45 miles northward from Durango to the Victorian mining town
of Silverton by a 150-ton vintage steam locomotive. The D &AMP; SNGR
was blasted through the mountains and forests here during the early
1880s to haul precious metals. Today it carries an equally valuable
cargo: about 200,000 tourists per year. I'm no railroad buff, but
plenty of folks who ride this remarkable train are dead serious
about rails. Overheard at the historic Durango depot before we
left:
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe I'm riding another train, Grandma.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll ride a lot of trains if you hang around with Grandpa
long enough. I think he'd like me better if I had steam coming out
of my ears.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip is a wonderful ride past sharp mountain peaks, stout
Douglas fir, abandoned mines, a limited-access resort, and . . ..
</P>
<P>
   ``Bear!'' someone yelled, and all us us scampered to one side of
the car to see a large black bear loping up a hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bear, bear, bear!'' someone else hollered a mile later, and we
dashed to the other side to see a mother with two cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only place to be,'' smiling conductor Frank Cianci
declared, referring to the fact that the alternative to an open
seat is an enclosed coach where some folks actually pass the time
by reading newspapers or napping.
</P>
<P>
   (Nathan's Red Hot D &AMP; SNGR Travel Tip: Don't take children on a
round-trip excursion, which includes two 3 1/2-hour legs as well as
a two-hour-and-15-minute layover in Silverton. Instead, have them
take the train to Silverton with Adult A. Have Adult B drive to
Silverton, about an hour's journey by car. Adult A and the kids
then drive back to Durango, while Adult B returns aboard the train.
Aggravation and money are thereby saved.)
</P>
<P>
   I was not eager to depart Durango, for more reasons than one.
Foremost among them was that we would be leaving via a section of
the 236-mile San Juan Skyway known as the Million Dollar Highway.
The origin of this name is vague, but to me it simply means the
amount of money required to lure me to this stretch of road, which
peaks at 11,018 feet and threads a two-lane path along precipitous
slopes without the niceties of guard rails. A 20-foot ladder is one
thing; looking into the abyss from a Buick is quite another.
</P>
<P>
   I handed the car keys to Margery, assigned Ethan to the
copilot's seat, and hunkered down very low in the back seat. I'm
told that the iron-colored Red Mountains were majestic, the sheer
sides of Uncompahgre Gorge breathtaking, and the waterfalls
breaking over the tunnels lovely. I wouldn't know. I didn't surface
until we'd safely descended into the alpine village of Ouray _
rhymes with ``Hooray!'' if I'm not mistaken.

SANTA MONICA IS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WITH A DIFFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. _ You can't help liking a town that may be
an affluent celebrity haven but whose signature structure is a
humble Ferris wheel.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, this is Santa Monica, geographically in Greater Los
Angeles but philosophically a non-glitzy and low-tech loving place
that does things its own way. Which explains why the civic icon is
no ordinary Ferris wheel.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing it's been in Pacific Park, the amusement park on
Santa Monica Pier, ever since it opened in 1916 _ making it
practically Pleistocene by Southern California standards. Nine
stories high, it is also visible from just about anywhere along the
3-mile-plus crescent of beach-rimmed Santa Monica Bay. At night,
when the gaudy neon trim is switched on, the Ferris wheel resembles
a giant pinwheel.
</P>
<P>
   The distinctive Santa Monica touch, however, is that Pacific
Park's Ferris wheel was the first in the world to be solar-powered.
But then, Santa Monica is also the first city whose municipal
facilities are powered entirely by recycled energy, geothermal
power in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed ``The People's Republic of Santa Monica'' in the
1970s, when it adopted (but has since rescinded) rent control, the
city has long been known for its liberal politics and environmental
activism. This is a community that prefers the nonpolluting to the
high-powered, likes to preserve as well as develop, and
enthusiastically supports foot-powered activities of all sorts.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of California may still be car-crazy but in Santa
Monica people walk. Impressive numbers of them also jog, bike, and
roller-blade from place to place. A local institution is the Friday
Night Skate, when roller-blading enthusiasts meet at the base of
Santa Monica Pier and kick off on a 10-mile-long group loop around
the city.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Monica even has that relative rarity on the West Coast, a
good public transportation system. It is served by buses of both
the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority and its own
Big Blue Bus line, which covers all of Santa Monica and also West
Los Angeles neighborhoods, such as Brentwood.
</P>
<P>
   However, the environmentalists' pride and joy _ and the most
convenient way to get around downtown Santa Monica and its
beachfront _ is the Tide Shuttle. The shuttle's colorfully
decorated electrically powered (i.e., non-polluting) minibuses run
daily every 15 minutes from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. weekdays and until
midnight on weekends. The fare is just 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Monica is also proud of its car-free Third Street
Promenade, a three-block-long walking street lined with some of the
city's best shops, restaurants, and cafes and dotted with kiosks
and public art. The promenade is much frequented by musicians and
street performers.
</P>
<P>
   There are also many panhandlers. Liberal Santa Monica is more
tolerant of the homeless than other coastal communities, such as
its famously conservative neighbor, Malibu.
</P>
<P>
   Pedestrian streets are also created by temporarily closing them
to traffic for Santa Monica's outdoor farmers' markets, the largest
in the Los Angeles area. This is a health- and diet-conscious place
and market stalls _ many belonging to organic farmers _ are piled
high with fresh-picked produce, including many exotic varieties of
lettuce, spinach, and other vegetables rarely seen in East Coast
supermarkets. Markets are held around the intersection of Third
Street and Arizona Avenue on Wednesdays and Saturdays and elsewhere
in the city on other days.
</P>
<P>
   Another great place for walkers and people watchers is Palisades
Park, a lushly planted 25-acre park overlooking the Pacific.
Located on Ocean Avenue, it runs for 10 blocks and has footpaths
and a bicycle path that connect with coastal bikeways in Venice and
Marina del Rey. Stairs and pedestrian bridges over the Pacific
Coast Highway connect the park with Santa Monica's broad beach,
familiar to TV viewers as the backdrop for many ``Baywatch''
episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Palisades Park recently got new plantings and an improved bike
path as part of an $8 million beach improvement project that
included the reopening _ with new state-of-the-weightlifter's-art
equipment _ of Muscle Beach, the area's original and most famous
seaside workout spot. For the less athletic, there is also
International Chess Park on Ocean Front Walk, south of the pier.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Monica has been a popular resort since the turn of the
century and has a number of old beachside hotels that have been not
only preserved but restored. One of the first to get this treatment
was the Shangri-La, a classic Art Deco hostelry on Ocean Avenue
across from Palisades Park. The most recent and grandest, however,
is the Renaissance Revival-style Casa del Mar, the last hotel
allowed right on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Built as a private club in 1926 _ and frequented by the likes of
Douglas Fairbanks Sr., Mary Pickford, and Charlie Chaplin _ it
eventually fell on hard times and in recent years was a ``longevity
center.'' It has been beautifully renovated in period style with
elegant public rooms that have a nice but not hokey 1920s feel to
them _ and terrific ocean views.
</P>
<P>
   Another new addition to the waterfront is The Lobster, a
restaurant beside the entrance to Santa Monica Pier. It, too, is
born again, sort of. Although essentially a modern building with
wraparound windows that provide patrons with long views of the
beautiful coastline and an up-close one of the Ferris wheel, The
Lobster's entrance incorporates the original 1930s seafood shack of
the same name. Santa Monica has a lot of good restaurants but The
Lobster's setting is special and it really takes the fruits of the
sea seriously: You can get Maine lobster as well as Pacific spiny
lobster, the white crab soup is exquisite, and the treatment of
fish such as black bass and John Dory is savory and imaginative.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason, perhaps because its walkability gives it an
Old World feeling, Santa Monica has a large resident British
community. As a result, the community also has quite a few genuine
English pubs, the best known of which are The Brittania and Ye Olde
Kings Head. The atmosphere in these establishments, from the
accents of the patrons and staff to the beer on tap and the soccer
games on TV, is as English as bangers and mash _ usually found on
the menu along with fish and chips and boiled Brussels sprouts.
</P>
<P>
   Far more common in Santa Monica than pubs are art galleries, and
the city boasts some 75 galleries and museums. Nearly 30
contemporary galleries are clustered at Bergamot Station on
Michigan Avenue, the site as well of the Santa Monica Museum of
Art.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Monica also makes a convenient base from which to visit
the not-to-be-missed Getty Center: an architecturally dramatic
hilltop art complex in the foothills of the Santa Monica Mountains
in Brentwood, just over the LA line. Admission to the Getty Center
is free but parking is severely limited and spaces in the parking
garage must be reserved, sometimes days in advance.
</P>
<P>
   However, the number 14 Big Blue Bus stops right at the center's
street-level entrance, from where a computer-operated tram carries
visitors to the hilltop site. As the tram snakes its way up the
hillside, there are sweeping views of Los Angeles and the
mansion-speckled slopes of Brentwood while the center itself stands
out against the horizon like a contemporary version of the
Acropolis. The center is built, in fact, largely of travertine _ a
beige-colored stone that resembles marble _ from the same Italian
quarries used to build the Colosseum in Rome and other monuments of
the ancient world.
</P>
<P>
   Although it contains the art collection of the late oil tycoon
J. Paul Getty, the center is not a museum in the conventional
sense. Rather, it is a campuslike complex of six buildings _
clustered around a central courtyard like an ancient temple _
housing offices of the Getty Foundation and facilities for study
and research in art-related fields as well as exhibition galleries
and pavilions.
</P>
<P>
   Architect Richard Meier sited the low-rise buildings so that
they seem to fit naturally into their hillside but also offer
viewing platforms and openings that frame views and vistas. There
are fountains and reflecting pools and the entire complex is
surrounded by superbly landscaped gardens that are a delight any
time of year.
</P>
<P>
   Although certainly interesting, and containing a number of minor
masterpieces, the collection _ which includes paintings, sculpture,
and illuminated manuscripts _ isn't in the same world class as its
architecture. Nevertheless, the Getty Center is an extraordinary
place that invites lingering _ there is a good restaurant and
several cafes and coffee bars _ and can be hard to leave.

BOLTON'S OFFER NEARLY BROUGHT R&AMP;B DISASTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, while many of us were preoccupied with the unholy
matrimony of Rick Rockwell and Darva Conger and the Versace hanky
Jennifer Lopez tried to pass off as a dress at the Grammys, we were
narrowly missed by a disaster of world-shaking proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bolton almost bought the song catalog of the Isley
Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   For some time, Bolton had been trying to buy out the assets of
Ronald Isley, leader of the greatest and most prolific R&AMP;B group in
music history. Despite 40 years of hits, Isley has so mismanaged
his money, it's a wonder the ``Behind the Music'' folks haven't
shown up at his door. Many others, though, have come a-knockin,'
including the Internal Revenue Service, which claims Isley owes
more than $5 million in taxes. The singer filed for bankruptcy
protection in 1997, and in December, the courts ordered liquidation
of his assets so his creditors could get paid.
</P>
<P>
   Into the fray came Bolton with a $5.3 million offer for Isley's
estate, which, among other things, would have given him the rights
and royalties to more than 200 Isley compositions and recordings _
everything from ``Shout'' to ``This Old Heart of Mine,'' ``It's
Your Thing'' to ``Fight the Power,'' and ``Voyage to Atlantis'' to
``Between the Sheets.''
</P>
<P>
   In a court statement, Bolton maintained his offer was ``clearly
in the best interest of creditors.'' But a Los Angeles Federal
court judge didn't agree, approving a competing _ and smaller _
offer from a Wall Street financier, thus bringing an end to
Bolton's bid.
</P>
<P>
   Thank heavens for Judge Kathleen March.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, if you will, rival composer Antonio Salieri laying
claim to the works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Or Pat Boone, who
made his early career in the 1950s sucking the air and energy out
of such songs as ``Tutti Frutti'' and ``Ain't That a Shame,''
buying the catalogs of Little Richard or Fats Domino. Bolton owning
the music of the Isley Brothers would have been just as ironic and
devastating.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think for a minute Bolton's offer had anything to do with
magnanimity, or a desire to help an artist down on his luck. You
might recall that in 1994 a Los Angeles jury labeled Bolton a
plagiarist after they found significant similarities between his
1991 hit, ``Love Is a Wonderful Thing,'' and a 1966 song of the
same title _ which happened to belong to the Isley Brothers. Bolton
and his record company were ordered to make things right to the
tune of $5.4 million, and an appeal is still pending. But if the
judge overseeing the Isley estate had accepted Bolton's offer,
Isley would have lost his share of the settlement, and Bolton would
have been off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another part to this. Lest anyone forget, Bolton
built his career on the backs of black artists, mauling,
manhandling, and generally massacring soul and R&AMP;B classics. With
his big yelping voice and remarkably small talent he laid to waste
such songs as Otis Redding's ``Sittin' on the Dock of the Bay,''
Percy Sledge's ``When a Man Loves a Woman,'' and Ray Charles's
``Georgia on My Mind.'' He sang every song with such unharnessed
histrionics it seemed like his head might explode _ yeah, if only.
</P>
<P>
   Considered by some as a blue-eyed soul singer (Van Morrison
might have something to say about that), the hole-in-his-soul
Bolton sold millions of records to folks who just didn't know
better. Wrote Stephen Thomas Erlewine in the ``All Music Guide'' of
Bolton's soul covers: he ``removes any pretense of subtlety,
straining any emotions from the song with his overwrought
delivery.'' And that's putting it kindly.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been nothing short of an abomination and a
travesty had Bolton been allowed to profit so directly from the
Isleys, whose music remains vital, and has long been popular in
television commercials, movies (try to think of ``Animal House''
without ``Shout'') and hip-hop samples.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this brush with near-catastrophe has taught Ronald Isley
anything about better financial management remains to be seen. But
this much is unassailably clear: Michael Bolton will thankfully
come no closer to the Isleys' song catalog than the ``I'' section
of his local record store. And that, to paraphrase Isley, is a
wonderful thing.

HAMILL'S `FORK' TURNS TOWARD A LOVE STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
FORK IN THE ROAD 
By Denis Hamill 
Pocket Books, 480 pp., $24.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the heart of Denis Hamill's ``Fork in the Road'' is the aptly
named Gina Furey. Poor, passionate, and wildly unconventional,
tender and primally scary, she is the center and high-revving
engine of this very entertaining novel, Hamill's sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Gina is the product of a Dickensian past, and Hamil captures the
bloody violence and romance of her Irish background in bright,
sharp prose. She lives in a Dublin slum that today seems a
throwback to an earlier era: ponies, goats, and dogs forage for
food among the covered wagons, garbage, and auto parts that
decorate the seething neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   This book is a departure from Hamill's usual hard-boiled crime
thrillers _ it's a fiery, knockabout love story, although abounding
in crime. The misdeeds are mostly Gina's. She is a ``traveler,'' or
Irish gypsy, steeped in a life of scamming and thievery. As
Hamill's narrator-protagonist, Colin Coyne, says of Gina and some
accomplices he spies pilfering clothes in a department store,
``These chicks could con Houdini.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a mercurial young woman like Gina, restless and prickly
and bound by ancient tradition to an itinerant life of crime,
living in residential Queens or attending the Academy Awards
ceremony in Los Angeles. She does both in ``Fork in the Road,''
whose often hilarious and sometimes poignant culture clashes give
it the quality of the first ``Crocodile Dundee'' movie, only more
literate and artful _ in the end, perhaps two parts art to one part
melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   It is through Gina's usually light-fingered pickpocketing that
we first encounter her. Colin has come to Dublin to mull over his
mother's recent death and search out a subject for a feature film.
He's a hungry young moviemaker, an Irish-American artist-stud from
Queens with a street savvy that can't quite match Gina's.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he cleverly manages to track her down after she
pockets his wallet. And Hamill, in the process, flavorfully evokes
the city and its inhabitants, often in fine, simple observations
such as this: ``Many of the gray-haired ladies reminded him (Colin)
of his mother, inherently industrious and moving in a double-time
step as if they were perpetually late for life itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Colin is magnetized by Gina's raw allure and brazen, illicit
lifestyle, so he not only follows her but falls for her. His
attraction, he wants to believe, is more professional than
romantic. So in sketching out a screenplay about her, he distances
himself by creating a naive alter ego, a character called Kieran.
Hamill presents Colin's notions about the film in italics, as when
Kieran ``falls for her the way some women fall for gangsters.
Kieran is a good guy who falls in love with a bad girl.''
</P>
<P>
   The device helps steer the novel around the shoals of
sentimentality, and serves to launch some of the book's
laugh-out-loud humor _ even if, by the end, it seems intrusive and
sophomorically pretentious. Nothing is funnier, by the way, than
the raucous visits of Gina's thieving, sponging family to America,
where one of them torches a Queens bar and Colin decides to hide
the family silver in a toolbox. The novel's virtues far outpace its
few distinct flaws, including a breathlessly action-oriented but
much too convenient conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Though mostly credible, Colin is a caricature: Gorgeous women
line up for his attentions, beefy men collapse under his fistic
prowess. Still, Hamill choreographs the couple's tumultuous,
picaresque pas de deux with gleeful energy, an unerring sense of
place, and a terrific ear for dialect. The jargon of the Irish
travelers, whom Hamill has clearly researched in detail, is
especially rich, often droll, and rampant with animal images. Says
Gina, for example, when Colin takes her to an upscale restaurant
for a salmon steak, ``That'll do me like a dog on a rat.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, there is Gina herself, a woman of appetites who can
``go from coarse hostility to blinding sweetness like a costume
change,'' and who's clever enough to wow a Hollywood producer with
her outspoken insights but so tied to traveler tradition she can't
stop stealing from Rodeo Drive boutiques. Perhaps ``Fork in the
Road'' isn't a masterwork, but this inspired and unforgettable
character is.

EXPO LEFTOVERS: A NICE FIT WITH OLD LISBON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON _ If you missed Expo '98, as I did, and show up two years
late, that's OK. It's still here, and looking very good.
</P>
<P>
   Why tear down a handsome, imaginative district that was created
to welcome the world to Portugal's riverside party two years ago?
Leave it in place, was the smart decision, and let Lisboans and
visitors keep on enjoying it. Like these schoolchildren, in blue
caps and smocks, giggling their way along Volcano Row and marveling
at the periodic in-your-face eruptions that may splash them
harmlessly (with water, not lava) if they're not alert.
</P>
<P>
   The volcanoes, a lineup of 15-foot ceramic cones in bright reds,
greens, and yellows, spout as kids shout. They are just another of
the innumerable examples of Portuguese artistry in tile (azulejos)
through the ages. Then, at their teachers' suggestion, the
field-trippers move away to other attractions, like a pyramid of
ropes that just begs to be climbed.
</P>
<P>
   My friend, Aurelio, unable to resist any such clambering
prospect, ascends like a galleon's nimble deckhand in the rigging.
Her adult presence in their lair amuses the fellow-climbing kids,
who will go on to a variety of play sites amid gardens, fountains,
waterfalls, and captivating sculptures of African animals, among
them a towering, whimsical giraffe looking into a looking glass.
</P>
<P>
   An aerial tram offers a scenic overview that more fully reveals
the futuristic science center and the mushroom-shaped 16,000-seat
arena, to host the season-concluding ATP Masters tennis
championships in November.
</P>
<P>
   Once an unsafe neighborhood of warehouses and dingy domiciles
along the very broad Tagus River, the conduit for international
shipping to the Atlantic Ocean, it was upgraded spectacularly by
the Expo '98 concept. Spruced and rehabbed, it is distinguished by
exciting, innovative architecture that left such as an apartment
building masquerading as an ocean liner in its wake.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving by train, subway, or bus at Oriente Station, you are
overwhelmed by the feathery, airy structure that itself is enough
reason to look in on Lisbon. A city that pre-dates Christ, the town
is decorated by plenty of ancient evidence of Romanesque and Gothic
architects, like the compelling Monastery of Jeronimos or the
fortress called the Tower of Belem. Guarding the mouth of the
Tagus, from which Vasco da Gama and other renowned explorers of the
15th-century ``Age of Discovery'' set out on their voyages to
create a Portuguese empire, the tower seems a fancy wedding cake in
concrete. Looks good enough to eat, but only if you're the
steel-jawed Godzilla.
</P>
<P>
   Steel-ribbed is Oriente Station, perhaps owing something to
those old church builders of the Middle Ages. This masterpiece of
steel and glass _ a cathedral of transportation _ came from the
drawing board of the Spanish genius of design, Salvador Calatrava.
You might call it Calatrava Gothic, a modern takeoff on the
medieval: Three lanes of tracks as the nave and aisles extend
beneath steel-supported glass archways that dart heavenward 60
feet, seeming gossamer wings.
</P>
<P>
   Gawking at his intricate ceiling as you would the groined
vaulting of, say, the cathedral at Chartres, you are similarly
enchanted _ but here the sky enters in as an element, embellishing
the design. Way below, underground, the subway terminal is a happy
collage of tile murals.
</P>
<P>
   Close by, his bridge across the Tagus is another beauty. And,
currently underway, Calatrava's remake of Milwaukee's Museum of
Fine Arts, roofed by moving wings, will be regarded as one of the
world's wonders. Red Sox management should keep him in mind if they
ever really re-create that gem of Back Bay Gothic named Fenway
Park.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston architect, Peter Chermayeff, conceived Expo's
centerpiece, the Oceanario, an aquarium clearly deserving a
creme-de-la-creme rating (or is it cream of the water?).
Chermayeff, designer of the Boston aquarium, may be a fish's best
friend, at least a fish that has to lead a sheltered life. With a
``one ocean'' theme of blending all oceans, he has created habitats
that may pass as genuine-down-home in the minds of the thousands of
maritime roomers, swimming, flying, and growing.
</P>
<P>
   You could spend days absorbing a planet's worth of sea life _
underwater and on shore _ in huge display tanks. Denizens of every
ocean and temperature zone _ icy to balmy _ are on display, making
their daily rounds. Sharks and barracudas cruise menacingly.
Blue-eyed Antarctic penguins frolic. Gallant male cardinal fish,
incubating their young in their mouths, may starve in the maternal
role. Razorbill auks wing close to the water, and are able to
submerge and swim beneath the surface. Red algae bloom in tidal
pools. Coral reefs abound with life. Furry sea otters are the
comedians, backstroking, mugging, belly-flopping like clowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those otters are so cute and energetic, they make you hungry
just watching them,'' says Aurelio. She is tempted to dive in and
join in their shenanigans, but I persuade her that Chermayeff would
disapprove of humans integrating with the residents in his oceanic
fun house.
</P>
<P>
   Since the otters have aroused hunger, we compromise by mingling
with a fork in a seafood luncheon at Tapas Marina, one of the Expo
restaurants on a pier reaching out into the Tagus.

IN THE LAND OF THE HAVASUPAI 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN CUNNINGHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The relaxed mood from my vacation began wearing off at 9:37 on a
Monday morning as I was driving to work. The place? A half-mile
before the toll booths on Boston's Tobin Bridge in stalled traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The familiar tense feeling one gets in the stomach and shoulders
when commuting to Boston had returned. That white SUV in the right
lane with its wheels turned a bit to the left? No way am I letting
it cut in front of me, particularly since the driver is not
signaling. Look through the rear-view mirror. The woman driving the
car in back is creeping too close while talking on a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic crawls into a tunnel. Beyond, silhouetted against the
sky, are the girders and concrete structures of the Big Dig
project. It takes 50 minutes to go two miles. I am among tens of
thousands traveling into a city of nearly 600,000 inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   During the just-ended vacation in Arizona, my wife and I took
about the same amount of time to drive 60-plus miles one Monday
morning on a road bordered by ponderosa and pinon pine and saw only
one other moving vehicle, a pickup truck going in the other
direction.
</P>
<P>
   We were part of a group of nine to gather at a trailhead for a
hike down to Havasu Canyon, one of the prettiest spots in the Grand
Canyon area. Soaking in the pools beneath its waterfalls and hiking
its trails, one can easily forget everyday aggravations.
</P>
<P>
   In five days, we hiked more than 40 miles, saw a lot of
spectacular scenery, and met some nice people who lent a hand (and
a knee) to trail companions.
</P>
<P>
   We were in the land of the Havasupai _ The People of the
Blue-green Water.
</P>
<P>
   Water is always on one's mind there. It weighs down packs.
Hikers drink lots of it, more than you would imagine if you had not
hiked in the arid Southwest. Try three quarts, or a gallon a day if
you can get it.
</P>
<P>
   Water creates, water destroys, water creates. It's an endless
circle.
</P>
<P>
   Water brings life to Supai, the Indian village eight miles from
Hualapai Hilltop. It sustains gardens and fruit trees, and creates
a natural beauty that attracts visitors whose spending helps the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   It also can bring danger. At times in summer rains, called by
some the ``monsoon season,'' the creek can swell, endangering all
who live or camp along it. Hundreds fled a flash flood in August
1997. Similar floods were reported in 1990 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The water creates its own beauty and paves its pathway. As it
rushes on its winding route to the Colorado, the water carries
minerals in solution that reflect the blue sky, and which coat the
creek bed and nearby rocks with a rust-colored material called
travertine.
</P>
<P>
   We started hiking early on the first day, hoping to get to camp
or at least the village before the sun became most intense. The
first two miles or so were down a steep wall, but switchbacks
relieved some of the burden on our legs. We began seeing hikers,
often accompanied by a dog or two from the village, heading back up
to their cars.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs also come along with the pack trains and horseback riders
we saw a bit later. The dogs are remarkably well-behaved and seem
to consider it all in a day's work to tag along.
</P>
<P>
   Whose dogs are they? ``They belong to all of us,'' Dianna Sue
Uqualla, a village resident who gave a talk to us later in the
week.
</P>
<P>
   As the morning advanced, the sun beat down on us. Despite
sending some gear down by pack train, I began to feel the effort of
carrying a backpack. Perhaps spending the previous two days
overeating at Las Vegas buffets and playing the slots in smoky
rooms was not the best prelude to this kind of exertion. Two quarts
of water were consumed quickly. Greenery came into view as we
approached the creek and there was a bit of a cooling effect.
</P>
<P>
   When you get to Havasu Creek, you hear it before you see it, and
it is noisy as it flows past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't hear you when the water's running,'' was the response
to a soft-spoken comment.
</P>
<P>
   There are large cottonwood trees along the creek's banks. One
sees large white flowers on a thick stalk _ a type of morning
glory. Even the prickly pear cactus seems in bloom, sporting a
darkish fruit colored like a ripe eggplant.
</P>
<P>
   Trip leader Bruce Banker called our attention to a red-rock
ridge overlooking the village. There, silhouetted against the sky,
stood two pillars called the Wigleeva, said to be guardian spirits.
A legend says that the village will be destroyed if they fall.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Supai is like walking down a dusty country lane. Small
houses and their corrals are fenced off from the road. After an
eight-mile hike, the sight of a satellite dish in a yard challenges
one's preconceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The village seems to have one foot in the past and one in the
present. It is neither a museum piece nor a tourist trap. We had
been cautioned to take no pictures of people without permission.
Pack trains go back and forth, and the center near a store and
restaurant can seem busy. Visitors walk and ride in, and a small
helicopter brings people and some supplies.
</P>
<P>
   There is a basketball court and a Head Start headquarters, and
notices are posted for school board and other elections. Supai has
its own post office. Mail is delivered and sent out via four legs,
not four wheels. There are no cars in the village, just some
tractors and other small vehicles used on jobs.
</P>
<P>
   We camped two miles beyond Supai. The gear we had sent down was
waiting for us. A hiking companion, Richard Bass of Houston, had
won our gratitude by arranging for a load on one of the mules in a
supply train and offering us a share. The cost of $30 to send 30
pounds down, and up at the end of five days, was a bargain. Our
knees and back appreciated it.
</P>
<P>
   We set up camp within sight of each other, my wife and I tenting
near and sharing a picnic table with Ash and Boni Mukherjee of
Riverside, Calif., who had felt the pull of the Grand Canyon and
taken up backpacking just recently.
</P>
<P>
   Richard tented near Richard and Anne Gollnick of Green Bay, Wis.
Richard said he had first visited the Grand Canyon at the South Rim
visitors' center when he was a child. With his mother and brother,
he had ridden a horse down about 50 years ago and he returned in
recent years to hike in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The Gollnicks said they had come to Arizona to see the Chicago
Cubs at spring training a few years ago, took a side trip to the
Grand Canyon, and decided they had to walk down. That led to
further interest in hiking and to this trip.
</P>
<P>
   Greg and Doug Hoke, a fit father and 21-year-old son, were on an
outing together before Doug began his final year of college. They
found a flat spot and spread out a tarp, going without a tent. They
stayed warm enough but discovered mice and mosquitoes ruled the
campground at night. ``Lights out and the camp's theirs,'' one of
our companions said. ``Like it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce, who took a site about in the middle of all of us, is a
former Park Service ranger who now leads trips for the organization
that arranged this outing, the Grand Canyon Field Institute, and
for Elderhostel. This was his 11th backpack to Havasu Canyon in two
years.
</P>
<P>
   We dunked in the creek, ate, and made some plans. Bruce spoke
that night about hiking up to a ridge, but in the morning
suggested, instead, we might like to get a taste of the trail we
were going to be on for 12 hours Wednesday. So Tuesday we took
light packs and ambled off for Mooney Falls.
</P>
<P>
   The trail went to a point where we looked 200 feet down to where
the falls ended in a large, clear pool. We walked around on the
rock. Here was a chain railing and an entrance to a tunnel whose
floor dropped steeply. ``That's the trail?'' Yes.
</P>
<P>
   With varying degrees of anxiety, we entered. Helping each other,
we worked our way down, stepping into unlikely indentations,
holding dangling chains, grabbing steel rods driven into the rock.
</P>
<P>
   Where the holds were too far apart for those with shorter legs,
Bruce braced himself: ``Step on my knee.'' We did, using him as a
foothold.

 &HT;    MISSING RUSSIAN REPORTER ALIVE AND TALKING OF TORTURE
 &HT;    (700&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ After more than one month in captivity, Russian
journalist Andrei Babitsky was returned Tuesday to his home in
Moscow, alive, well and talking about the torture he allegedly
endured while in the hands of Russian forces.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky re-surfaced last Friday in the Russian republic of
Dagestan, which adjoins Chechnya, after a mysterious set of events
in mid-January _ when Russian authorities admitted that they had
detained the investigative journalist, and then handed him over to
Chechen rebels in a prisoner-of-war exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In two separate interviews Tuesday, one with his own news
agency, U.S.-funded Radio Liberty, and one with the independent
Russian television station NTV, Babitsky, 35, looked weary and sick
as he spoke for the first time about his ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   In chilling detail, he told about the treatment of those
detained, himself included, by federal forces and held in the
notorious Chernokozovo filtration camp. The camp was set up by the
Russian army to weed out Chechen rebels from the civilian
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the hands of sadists who kept me in Chernokozovo
concentration camp. The word beating takes on a new meaning there.
It's torture,'' Babitsky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a journalist, I was only subjected to a very light
'initiation' procedure which consists of crawling some distance
under the strikes of rubber batons. It's painful, but it is nothing
compared to tortures of those who are suspected of involvement with
the illegal armed formations (Chechen rebel groups),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Russian soldiers) would entertain themselves by making people
run on their knees along the corridor,'' he said, adding that he
heard women screaming in ``unbearable pain'' while he was there.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has come under fire in recent weeks for alleged war
crimes against civilians during the six-month war against Chechen
rebels _ including summary executions of women and children, and
torture and rape at ``filtration camps'' like Chernokozovo.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with Cox Newspapers, survivors from these camps,
who either had escaped or bribed their way out of captivity,
described sweeping arrests by Russian forces, followed by periods
of detention in which Chechens are beaten, tortured and raped.
</P>
<P>
   Chernokozovo, located about 30 miles east of the Russian
southern military headquarters in Mozdok, appears to be the largest
of the detention centers. From the outside, it appears more
desolate than evil, a dingy white concrete structure surrounded by
barbed-wire fences.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Russian authorities accompanied Western journalists
on a tour of the facility. Maj. Gen. Mikhail S. Nazarkin, the
director of Chernokozovo since Feb. 10, told reporters that he had
gone to great lengths to fix up the facility, but dismissed reports
of torture as ``stupidities and rubbish.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The Chernokozovo story is only part of Babitsky's experience.
His orchestrated handover on Feb. 3 from Russian authorities into
the custody of masked men has been a thorn in the side of Russian
acting President Vladimir Putin. Russia's Western allies and
journalists have decried the exchange as illegal; Russian
authorities said Babitsky agreed to it.
</P>
<P>
   Questions remain as to whether Babitsky was in the hands of
rebels, Russian security forces or pro-Moscow Chechens. Babitsky
revealed Tuesday he had no idea who held him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they were Chechens, but they weren't field
commanders'' like the Russian government had contended, he said.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the whole affair has taken on a surreal tinge,
with Kremlin spokesmen issuing statements that contradict others
made by the Russian military and Interior Ministry about the
details of Babitsky's whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government has always insisted the journalist was
alive, but would not allow his lawyer or wife access to what they
called top secret information confirming this fact.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the government opened a criminal case against
Babitsky, alleging that he was involved with the Chechen rebels.
That accusation of treason could carry a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Until Babitsky showed up in Dagestan Feb. 25, his colleagues
felt for certain he was dead. Speculation ran rampant that the
reason for his disappearance had to do with what he had seen in
Chernokozovo.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky said he was freed by the people who had held him since
the Russian prisoner exchange. They left him in the town of
Makhachkala, with an Azeri passport and none of his own identity
papers.
</P>
<P>
   He spent his first hours of freedom checking into the Hotel
Dagestan and then going to a cafe to eat. There, he was approached
by Interior Ministry troops and arrested for holding counterfeit
papers. He then spent the weekend in their custody.
</P>
<P>
   Putin himself had remained quiet about the whole affair until
Monday, when he made a public remark saying he doubted Babitsky was
dangerous enough to warrant being held in custody.
</P>
<P>
   Within 24 hours, Babitsky was put on a government plane and
flown to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   He still faces charges of treason and counterfeiting, and is
restricted from travelling outside of the Russian capital while the
investigation into those charges continue.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky said he's happy to be back home, but warned
congratulations were premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Investigators) believe the case against me should continue no
matter how insignificant the reasons for it are,'' Babitsky said.
``The different levels of power are in disagreement about what to
do with me. There is no planned approach. There is no agreement.
But they can destroy anyone who gets in their way. This is the way
our system works.''

FOR MCCAIN, A HOME RUN AND AN ERROR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Can John McCain, riding along on his high wire, be
inspiringly right and disastrously wrong at the same time?
</P>
<P>
   His allies in California, trying to help him clear the highest
hurdle the McCain campaign has faced to date, think so.
</P>
<P>
   They reacted with horror upon discovering that McCain would not
show up for the only debate planned prior to the state's primary on
March 7, which he has said will be won by the eventual Republican
nominee. Also, they expressed varying degrees of confidence that by
the time you read these words McCain will have understood his goof
and rearranged his schedule in New York to accommodate the joint
appearance Thursday evening with Alan Keyes and George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But all this was before the California dreamers found out that
McCain was also in the process of escalating his battle with Bush
over the hate-mongering of Bob Jones and his university and the
extremism of Pat Robertson and his Christian Coalition. Instead of
more sniping over Bush's inability to appreciate the significance
of his campaign appearance earlier this month at the bastion of
bigotry in South Carolina, McCain has tried to launch a debate
about the strangling alliance that lies behind that symbol _ his
party's Faustian bargain with the religious right, specifically
Robertson and Jerry Falwell.
</P>
<P>
   But the key word is ``debate.''
</P>
<P>
   What McCain did in Robertson's own lair of Virginia Beach on the
eve of gateway primaries in that state and in Washington is already
provoking both a counter-reaction from the threatened right and an
outpouring of support for McCain's boldness in confronting the guts
of his party's dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's momentum is on the line in the gateway states (plus
North Dakota) today. But his survival is on the line next week in
the country's first essentially national primary. Having raised the
issue of the Robertson wing's hold on the party in such a
confrontational way while stepping away from the debate borders on
the irrational.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is even more irrational in the face of the major
effort the senator is making here. He is in the middle of a roughly
$3 million TV advertising campaign that for the first time is
competitive with Bush's. And his campaigning time in California
reflects a heavier commitment. To do that but skip the CNN-Los
Angeles Times debate (and a possible Times endorsement) makes no
sense.
</P>
<P>
   His major supporters, from Mayor Susan Golding in San Diego to
Secretary of State Bill Jones in Sacramento, do not appreciate
being left holding the bag. Nor do they like having to deny the
Bush line that McCain is bailing out because he trails by 10 to 20
points in California polls.
</P>
<P>
   But the public will be the biggest loser if McCain doesn't
change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, there was a political element to McCain's
speech Monday. He was determined that Bush's remarkable letter of
apology to New York's Cardinal John O'Connor about his silence at
Bob Jones University not be the end of an issue that has powered
his campaign since South Carolina. But it's also true that McCain
had largely written his speech before Bush acknowledged that he
regretted not challenging bigotry at the university.
</P>
<P>
   And McCain's speech was right on target. People will argue about
his equation of Robertson and Jerry Falwell with ``union bosses''
in Democratic politics and with Minister Louis Farrakhan and Al
Sharpton in religion-based politics, but he was careful to separate
the Republican reverends from conservative Christians who shun the
secular broker's role. And he was correct in his condemnation of
those who have hijacked ``good causes'' and turned them into big
business.
</P>
<P>
   His description of post-New Hampshire George Bush as ``a Pat
Robertson Republican who will lose to Al Gore'' was rough but fair
comment; and his applause line that ``this is the party of Abraham
Lincoln not Bob Jones'' is a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows what this outburst will trigger, but in no state is it
more important than this one, where the Republican Party is caught
in a vise between its dominant right wing and more moderate voices
struggling to bring change.
</P>
<P>
   How ironic it would be if McCain blows his last chance here in
large part because he wasn't willing to reschedule some rally back
in New York.

CRASHING THE CORONATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A friend phoned the other day to complain about the
``coronation'' of George W. Bush as the Republican presidential
candidate. It's not that she's a McCain supporter; she just can't
stand the verb that always comes slouching along when TV and radio
commentators get onto this subject, the despised coronate. ``Why
not just say crown?'' she wondered.
</P>
<P>
   The same cloud of annoyance hovers over administrate, a verb
that usually means just what administer does, and shadows
orientate, preventative, and similar words with syllables they
don't really need. In the 1926 editon of Modern English Usage, H.W.
Fowler compiled a list of Long Variants, and these examples fall
into the category he labeled ``Needless lengthenings of established
words due to oversight or caprice.''
</P>
<P>
   His list offers some comfort to the tormented, though. Of the 13
words Fowler condemns, only administrate and preventative are still
bugging significant numbers of language watchers. We've chosen to
defy him on extemporaneously; Fowler and his fellow schoolteachers
preferred ex tempore, but we no longer throw Latin around with such
abandon.
</P>
<P>
   And most of his other worries proved groundless. Filtrate for
the verb filter, experimentalize for experiment, perfection for the
verb perfect _ nits of the early 20th century, apparently _ are
nowhere to be seen. So coronate, too, may be just a vogue word,
something today's reporters grab for in the hope that it sounds
less literal than crowned, but not a usage with legs.
</P>
<P>
   Another presidential-election pain is electoral, increasingly
pronounced with the accent on OR. It should be e-LEC-tor-al, not
e-lec-TOR-al (we're ignoring phonetics here, except for the
accents), just as mayoral should be pronounced MAY-or-al. In ``The
Big Book of Beastly Mispronunciations,'' Charles Harrington Elster
notes that e-lec-TOR-al gets a disapproving mention on its first
appearance _ in the 1961 Webster 3 unabridged dictionary, which
disapproved of very little _ and ``did not appear in another
dictionary for 25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Coronate can claim a better pedigree than e-lec-TOR-al. It goes
back centuries, and it's not an ignorant coinage, according to the
Merriam-Webster usage czars, but a borrowing from the Latin past
participle form. But scions of even the best families can go
astray, and coronate is unwelcome to many educated ears, even if
it's now recognized by our dictionaries.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you like a good fight, and if you'd rather defend your
language than your candidate, go with the debatable usages. But if
you say crown instead of coronate, and accent electoral on the
second syllable, you won't have listeners wailing and gnashing
their teeth, and missing the substance, if any, of what you're
trying to say.

powerful family dynasty in Hong Kong, is acquiring the territory's
flagship telephone company, Cable and Wireless HKT, with seeming
ease, despite his company's small size and meager assets, and
despite a formidable counterbid by the much larger Singapore
Telecommunications. The deal has troubled some people in Hong Kong,
who say it smacks of the kind of favoritism and old-boy cronyism
that characterized business in Hong Kong during 154 years of
colonial rule. There is no hard evidence that Li's political
connections were the decisive factor in his victory over Singapore
Telecommunications. The Hong Kong government said Tuesday it did
not interfere in the process. And Cable and Wireless insists it
chose the better offer. But an executive close to the company said

<P>
   Q. Will the sun eventually burn out?
</P>
<P>
   DB, Newton, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, but it should be a low priority on your worry list:
Scientists say the sun has enough fuel to burn for another 5
billion years or so. But when it goes, it will go out with a bang,
not a whimper.
</P>
<P>
   The sun, which is made up primarily of hydrogen and helium, has
been in existence for about 4.6 billion years. Every second of the
sun's life, 700 million tons of hydrogen are converted into helium
ashes, releasing 5 million tons of pure energy. That means that, as
time goes by, the sun becomes lighter.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of its life, the sun is expected to fuse helium into
heavier elements and expand, growing so large that it will swallow
the Earth. It will then spend a billion years as a red giant, a
star with a low surface temperature, and then suddenly collapse
into a white dwarf, a whitish star of high surface temperature. It
may then take about a trillion years to cool off.
</P>
<P>
   So, no point in losing sleep over the whole affair.

<P>
   Cody Jones will patiently explain to friends that he's the son
of a white mother and black father. But with all the
world-weariness a 15-year-old can muster, he'll sigh, ``You are
what people think you are,'' a fact that makes him identify more
with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Now meet his sister Julia Jones, who is less constrained by
age-old codes of racial classifications that once compelled people
with even one drop of black blood to claim African-American status.
When inquiring minds want to know her racial background, she tells
them she's black, white, and Native American. ``I don't feel as
strong a need to see myself as strictly black,'' explains the
19-year-old Columbia University freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Neither does Mikiko Thelwell, the daughter of a
Japanese-American mother and Jamaican father who proudly calls
herself Afro-Asian. ``How can I consider myself either/or?'' asks
Thelwell, 15, a student at Amherst (Mass.) Regional High School.
``Because I don't look either/or and I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   A new generation of biracial people is refusing to be
categorized within the slim confines of black, white, Hispanic,
Native American, or Asian/Pacific Islander. Call it the Tiger Woods
syndrome, after the golfer who invented the word ``Cablinasian'' to
describe his Caucasian, black, Indian, and Asian roots. He's part
of an increasing number of cultural role models, from Mariah Carey
to Lenny Kravitz, who proudly acknowledge their multifaceted
heritages.
</P>
<P>
   The force of the change is so strong that when Census 2000 forms
hit mailboxes in March, people will for the first time be able to
check more than one box for racial identification. But Census
officials believe that less than 2 percent of the population will
actually do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There still are biracial people who prefer to identify
themselves as one race or the other,'' says Pearl Gaskins, who
interviewed multiracial youths for her book ``What Are You?: Voices
of Mixed-Race Young People,'' published last year. ``But I think
there is a growing number of people who feel that that's not
adequate for them. They want to define themselves as mixed-race,
multiracial, which recognizes the different ethnic and racial
backgrounds that they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Among specialists in the field, there's palpable excitement
about the effects of widening racial categories in a nation that
has long resisted racial and cultural blending.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be harder and harder to define people in easily
definable ways,'' says G. Reginald Daniel, a sociology professor at
the University of California, Santa Barbara, who has written
extensively on the subject. ``It will force us to think twice
before we jump to any conclusions about people.''
</P>
<P>
   Powering the change is a rise in interracial marriages as racial
boundaries soften and pop culture offers up diverse icons such as
Michael Jordan and Jennifer Lopez. In 1960, only 149,000 such
unions were reported, according to Census Bureau statistics. By
1998, 1.3 million interracial couplings took place, a ninefold
increase.
</P>
<P>
   These new families are creating a rapidly expanding biracial and
mixed-race community. Information culled from the Census Bureau
indicates that 7 percent of the population could have claimed mixed
ancestry in 1995, say demographers Barry Edmonston, director of
Portland State University's Population Research Center, and Jeff
Passell, of the Urban Institute, in Washington, D.C. By 2050, they
believe, that number may climb to 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lise Funderburg, an author who specializes in issues of
integration, credits the 1967 Supreme Court case Loving v. Virginia
for changing attitudes. The decision shattered bans on interracial
marriage across the country. Couples started uniting under more
positive circumstances, says Funderburg, which affected how their
children viewed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original black-white unions were at best illegal and at
worse forceable conditions,'' explains Funderburg, herself the
product of an interracial marriage that began in 1955. ``More
recently, these are families where the parents love each other, are
married, and stay married. . . . Why wouldn't you want to identify
with both of them?''
</P>
<P>
   That love and mutual respect make new parents more reluctant to
define their children within the existing rigid racial categories,
Funderburg adds. Consider how Penny Wells and Frank Jones, Julia
and Cody's parents, guided their children on issues of identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank and I both agree,'' explains Wells, 48, seated in her
Jamaica Plain dining room as her children look on, ``that she
should be Julia Jones and he should be Cody Jones. They shouldn't
have labels attached to them, either white or black.''
</P>
<P>
   Parental intervention plays a strong role in helping biracial
children develop their sense of self. These informal life lessons
teach them how to navigate in a society where strangers strive to
fit them into preconceived racial categories and greet their
biracial status with such questions as ``What's it like?''
</P>
<P>
   Ashley White-Stern, 17, a junior at Phillips Academy in Andover,
Mass. was raised in the Jewish faith of her mother. But her black
father exposed White-Stern to African-American culture as well. So
she had a bat mitzvah at 13 and a year later participated in a
rites-of-passage ceremony inspired by African traditions. Last
December, she participated in a Kwanzaa celebration at Phillips
Academy, then visited old friends taking Hebrew school classes at
Temple Israel in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   For her, race has never been an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents always told me I was both,'' says White-Stern, who
wears her hair in skinny braids that snake past her shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Julia and Cody Jones speak fondly of how their father's guiding
hand helped them develop their identities. By the time Cody was 5,
Frank Jones, a lawyer, had started talking to him about the
struggles he had growing up as a black person in the Mississippi
Delta.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `People are going to look at you differently' ''
because of skin color, says Cody, who has the same parchment-paper
coloring as his sister. ``That's the best thing he could have done.
It helped me deal with the situation when it came up.''
</P>
<P>
   And there were situations, like the time Cody walked into a
Charlestown store with three other friends, two black and one
white. The clerk asked Cody's white friend, ``What are you doing
with these car thieves?''
</P>
<P>
   ``When people look at me they think of me as a black male,''
notes Cody, who diffuses such situations with jokes. But he feels
more comfortable with blacks, he says, because ``it's reassuring to
be with people who have experienced the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Frank Jones took his family on an ancestral journey
that weaved from Memphis to Clarksdale, Miss., where he was raised.
They visited the family grave site where years ago Frank Jones
buried his father in the rain. ``We had to find them in a swamp,''
says Julia Jones with a roll of her eyes. It was not at all like an
earlier trip to England, where the family visited the manicured
graves of their mother's ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   Such varied experiences give Julia Jones a point of view that
mono-racial people don't have, she says. They're the reason why she
felt uncomfortable being the only person of color taking ballet and
why she didn't identify with the black culture shown on film until
she set eyes on ``Waiting to Exhale.''
</P>
<P>
   So for Julia, ``black, white, and Native American'' is a more
accurate racial description than black, white, or even ``other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My views have a twist to them,'' she says. ``They're coming
from somewhere totally different than both black people and white
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit of both.''
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's tell a small fib. Let's say I have 100,000 extra dollars.
This, of course, is preposterous, particularly for someone whose
retirement plan largely consists of buying Mass Millions tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind. We're living at a time when lots of people _ many of
them so young that they think the Watergate scandal had something
to do with fluoride _ are walking around with that kind of spare
change. They've sold their companies, or they've inherited from Mom
and Dad, or they've even won Mass Millions. They're semi-flush.
</P>
<P>
   So I ask you: what should I do with my $100,000? Actually, I'm
asking David Brancaccio. Brancaccio, the host and senior editor of
``Marketplace'' on public radio, is the author of the
recently-published book, ``Squandering Aimlessly: My Adventures in
the American Marketplace.'' The 39-year-old Maine native, who lives
in Los Angeles with his wife and three children, took 10 trips in
16 months and then turned his meanderings into a 283-page look at
10 possible ways of disposing of burdensome cash. He schmoozed with
investment gurus, hung in Vegas, and considered suburban real
estate. He hunkered down with would-be entrepreneurs and wandered
the Mall of America. He visited a future ``retirement campus.''
</P>
<P>
   So I sent e-mail to Brancaccio: ``Dear David,`` I wrote. ``I
have $100,000 looking for a home. No kidding. Meet me in Boston and
tell me what to do with it.'' (The only thing I was kidding about,
of course, was the ``no kidding'' part.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Love to,'' Brancaccio replied to my invitation. But he also
warned me about ``Automotive Indigence,'' which he explained refers
to a car's ability to sense an economic windfall and break down at
a cost equal to the amount of that windfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry,'' I wrote back. ``The combined worth of my three
cars is $17,000. No chance of spending $100,000 on any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   We met for lunch at a Boston race track, an appropriate setting.
One of the options explored by Brancaccio in ``Squandering
Aimlessly'' is that of gambling (or ``gaming'' as they call it in
Las Vegas) with your windfall. Perhaps he would suggest that I put
my $100,000 on a horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Handicapping is a bit like picking stocks,'' he said as we
settled into a table overlooking the track's clubhouse turn on a
rainy afternoon. ``A skilled handicapper can look at this stuff,
divine some meaning, and it becomes a game of positive
expectations. We can probably, if we're good enough, actually win
here.''
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't too sure about the we part. In his book, Brancaccio
recounts betting $5 on a horse at 16-to-1 odds and winning $41.50.
But he should have received $80 plus his $5 original wager. Is this
the kind of guy I want giving me financial advice? ``I must have
remembered the odds wrong,'' he confessed sheepishly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see,'' he said a few moments later, ``I can't tell you
what to do with your money, `cause I don't know you well enough.''
And indeed, ``Squandering Aimlessly'' makes it clear that what a
person should do with extra cash depends on who the person is.
Still, Brancaccio had a few ideas: put as much money as I'm legally
allowed in my 401(k) account, donate some cash to charity, and
spend some ``fun money'' on something frivolous. ``In other words,
do something that you don't have to explain to anybody, even your
wife'' he said, referring to the last suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   I took notes furiously. ``That still leaves me about $90,000,''
I announced. ``Maybe I should do something about my son's college
education. He's 13.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my goodness,'' Brancaccio replied, looking straight into
my eyes. ``Thirteen? Oh, my goodness. You gotta grow this money.''
</P>
<P>
   So we tried to determine how much interest I had to earn to
``grow'' $90,000 into $120,000 _ our projection for the cost of a
college education _ over the next four years. Alas, Brancaccio
explained that he hadn't brought along the proper calculator to
come up with such a figure. ``I left it back in my hotel room,'' he
apologized. ``Call me later today.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, we considered a few options. We talked about buying real
estate and about taking a flyer on an Internet start-up company.
Brancaccio suggested possibly cutting back on my job and thereby
creating more time to spend with my son. ``It's nice to invest in
our children that way, particularly if we don't want to use our
extra money to bail them out of jail,'' he explained. ``There could
be an expensive downside to not doing that type of thing. There
could be lawyers' fees.''
</P>
<P>
   By now, it was time for the day's first race. Surveying the
sloppy track, I suggested a small wager on Stanley's Comet, a
4-year-old fillie who had won a race in a similar swamp three
months earlier. Leaving the starting gate at 7-to-1 odds, the horse
lumbered through a headwind to win by nearly three lengths. My $6
bet _ $2 to win, $2 to place, and $2 to show _ produced a profit of
$23.20. Brancaccio's $10 bet on Stanley's Comet to show put him $19
in the black.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be damned,'' Brancaccio declared. ``You should have put a
little bit more down, though. You analyzed the situation correctly,
but you have to have the power of your convictions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe so, but now I've got $93,023.10 to `grow','' I pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if I'd advised you to put your entire $100,000 on that
horse to win?'' Brancaccio asked. ``How much would you have won?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over $600,000,'' I replied, wondering why he hadn't.
(Actually, such a wager would have driven the odds on Stanley's
Comet so low that my profit would have been only $10,000.)
</P>
<P>
   We wisely left the track before the second race, our profits
safely in our pockets and the future of my alleged wad still
uncertain. When I called Brancaccio later at his hotel, he told me
he'd calculated that I needed to earn about 7 1/4 percent interest
over the next four years to ``grow'' my $93,023.10 into a college
education. ``And if you wait a couple of weeks,'' he said,
``30-year bonds will be paying just about 7 1/4 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Which sounded wise, but boring. Maybe I should have invested a
lot more money in Stanley's Comet. On the other hand, I remembered
what Brancaccio had told me about such a strategy as we were
leaving the track. ``You would have been stuck with the same
problem,'' he pointed out. `` `What do I do with my money?' See,
money itself is the problem. The more you have the more you have to
think about it.
</P>
<P>
   Money itself is the problem? What a relief. Thank goodness I
really don't have the 100,000 extra dollars that, as far as I know,
David Brancaccio still thinks I have.

   Sunlight. Those who were first at the bottom greeted each of the
following hikers with cheers and applause. ``Good going.'' ``All
right!'' ``You did great.''
</P>
<P>
   Strangers yesterday, we had become friends today. I think we had
passed some kind of test our leader had in mind all along.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the falls, we went under a thick overhang of travertine
and saw branches that had fallen into the creek were coated with
the mineral and incorporated into the wall.
</P>
<P>
   A certain Daniel Mooney, for whom the falls was named, became
part of this natural process. The story told is that he descended
near the falls one day in 1880, only to discover his rope was too
short. It broke when his companions tried to pull him up, and he
fell to his death. The next year, his body was found beneath the
falls, allegedly covered with a layer of travertine, and he was
interred there.
</P>
<P>
   We went on a way toward Fern Canyon. As we approached huge
boulders at the entrance, we heard music, clear notes echoing off
the walls. Were we hallucinating, someone asked. When we climbed up
and squeezed through an opening in the rocks, we saw a young
couple, the man sunning himself and the woman playing an ocarina.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us climbed to the back of the box canyon. Looking back
we could see how it was shaped by and at the mercy of the
occasional heavy rains. An enormous, curving gash scoured in the
solid rock on one side indicated where water carrying sand, pebbles
and boulders from the heights above apparently shot down. Fern
Canyon would be a swirling, tumultuous place in a storm.
</P>
<P>
   We returned to the campground with half the day left and soaked
in the creek at the swimming hole we favored. We played in the
current, fighting our way upstream as far as we could and floating
back without effort.
</P>
<P>
   At nightfall the stars showed distinctly in the sky above the
narrow canyon. Bruce had once given stargazing talks to North Rim
visitors. We learned to spot the summer triangle, Deneb, Altaire,
and Vega.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, we got up early and hit the trail shortly after 6
a.m. We had 14 miles to go.
</P>
<P>
   Between our tent sites and the falls, we passed a spot where an
old cottonwood tree, rotted at the base, had crashed down the night
before, the trunk missing an occupied tent by about six inches.
</P>
<P>
   We climbed down the tunnel with a little more assurance, and
went off toward the Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond on a cliff face, we could see the metal framework for a
most unlikely ladder. Actually, a series of wooden ladders attached
to the metal had extended more than 250 feet to a ledge where
vanadium was once mined. The Park Service has removed the ladders
themselves. Looking up to the top and imagining the climb gives one
some appreciation for the single-mindedness of such miners and the
dangers they endured.
</P>
<P>
   The day was long and pleasant. There were a few sections where
the trail rose high and narrowed; there was a rope that helped us
get up a steep stretch. We saw or heard a summer tanager, Wilson's
warbler, and ladderback woodpecker.
</P>
<P>
   Creek crossings were unavoidable. We would stop and change from
boots to sandals and back again many times. It was somewhat
inconvenient to do this, but the water helped cool us off. The
current was strong and we had to pick our way carefully, sometimes
taking a hand or offering one to others.
</P>
<P>
   For several miles, we saw nobody else on the trail. The rough
contours of stream and rock were occasionally made to look smooth
by grapevine running wild and covering everything, and we could
imagine we were in waist-high fields of grass.
</P>
<P>
   At some point we crossed the boundary of Havasupai land into the
Grand Canyon National Park Park.
</P>
<P>
   Near Beaver Falls, we began to see people coming up from the
Colorado River, four miles away. The falls is a favorite
destination for those on rafting trips who want to exercise their
legs and swim in the pools.
</P>
<P>
   When we reached the Colorado River, it was running swift and
muddy. We could put a hand or foot in it, but it was too dangerous
to wade in.
</P>
<P>
   We returned the same way we had come, getting to the campground
in twilight and making a quick meal. Despite the long day, some
felt energized and stayed up later than usual, chatting. Finally,
we called it a day. As I lay in my sleeping bag, I looked through
the tent's netting at the Milky Way, as distinct as I had ever seen
it.
</P>
<P>
   After a few days, the campground of 200 sites started to seem
like home and we began to know some of our neighbors and their
eccentricities.
</P>
<P>
   There were the two young women who brought trimmed-down bamboo
poles with large garden-party torches attached to the top. They
would use them as walking sticks during the day, and set them in
the ground at night and illuminate their campsite with them. They
were delighted to hear that they had become known throughout the
campground as the ``Tiki Torch Girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there were ``The Cowboys,'' led by David ``Pop''
Bartholomew. Lean, gray-bearded, and wearing a well-used cowboy
hat, Pop looked like an old cowpuncher, but he was just a guy on
vacation from La Habra, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   He had been visiting the canyon with his sons, daughters, and
friends every year since 1959 or '60.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take this same site every year, right by the wall,'' Pop
said.
</P>
<P>
   He had first read about the canyon in ``Arizona Highways,'' a
monthly magazine unsurpassed for its stories and pictures of the
state. So, shortly after leaving the Marines, he said, ``me and a
friend I got discharged with, we said why not come on down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys ran a busy and friendly camp. They rode horses down
to the campground and had their gear delivered. By neighborhood
standards, the camp was luxurious, with large tents, a two-burner
campstove, food like ham and bacon, and even a CD player. A visitor
could get a cup of coffee and even a meal there.
</P>
<P>
   All in the group seem to be thoroughly enjoying themselves,
spending their days hiking some trails, swimming behind 100-foot
Havasu Falls, fishing and playing cards.
</P>
<P>
   The day before we hiked out, we went to the village to hear
traditionalist Dianna Sue Uqualla.
</P>
<P>
   In the yard outside the tourist office, Dianna Sue sprinkled a
mixture of sage and tobacco around herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The circle is sacred to the Indian,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dianna Sue wore a representation of traditional Havasupai
clothing _ a long dress, moccasins and a shawl that could keep a
woman warm, or carry a baby or a load of firewood.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Havasupai now live year round in the village. In the
past the tribe summered in the canyon bottoms and went to plateau
lands in winter. Much of their land was taken from them in the 19th
and 20th centuries. A 1975 law restored thousands of acres above
and below.
</P>
<P>
   Dianna Sue says children still learn the tribe's language first,
and then English. She said most continue to make the village their
home when they grow up.
</P>
<P>
   It is a small and, apparently, tight group. ``We are one heart,
one mind,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A gentle woman with a soft voice and, yet, commanding presence,
Dianna Sue said she sees it as her special ``destiny'' to encourage
the perpetuation of the Havasupai traditional ceremonies and
culture and to explain aspects of them to those who are interested.
She had always been shy, she said, and was surprised the day when
she first was asked to speak to a group visiting the village. She
said she agreed and then wandered off wondering what she had done,
what she would say. She would get so nervous when she first began
these presentations, she said, that often she would cry.
</P>
<P>
   She was immersed in the everyday life of the village of the
present as she spoke about the enduring values of the past. A
little boy walked between her and her small audience, got his
bicycle, and rode off. A woman on one of the village work vehicles
went by on a nearby path, calling out a greeting. ``I taught her
how to drive that,'' Dianna Sue said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day I relaxed at the picnic table next to our tent
while others took a short hike. Writing in a journal and sipping
tea out of the scratched plastic cup that has been part of my
camping gear for more than 20 years, I could not have felt more at
peace, the rough edges of everyday life smoothed down through days
of physical exertion and the wonder of new experiences. Pop
Bartholomew walked over and said there was one thing he must say:
that he felt there is something special, maybe magical, about the
place and it is his hope that his family keep up the 40-year
tradition of camping there, introducing it to his grandchildren and
beyond. He'd even like it to be his final resting place, if
possible, as it is Mooney's.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a legend that everyone who comes done here returns,''
he said. ``It must be true. Everyone I've ever taken down here has
come back one time or another.''
</P>
<P>
   On the last day we broke camp quickly and had breakfast at the
village cafe. It was Friday. The village looked busier. Thousands
visit the village and campground during the year, and it appeared
weekends were a popular time. It was our time to go. We shouldered
the packs carrying our essentials _ water, snacks, and whatever
camp gear and extra clothing we did not send up on our share of a
mule.
</P>
<P>
   Near the top, two Indian women descended with effortless
strides. They wore no hats, carried no water. One had a small
plastic bag, making her look as if she had just stepped out of a
department store with a purchase, as they walked the eight miles
down to the home of the Havasupai.

   TAKE-BOS  
 UNDATED: ... in 1986.)  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the Senate Ethics Committee decided that the vacation
subsidies were House matters _ outside its jurisdiction. The
committee did not consider the mall investment germane. Nor was it
troubled by McCain's lobbying for Henkel.
</P>
<P>
   With public hearings looming, the bipartisan panel _ three
members from each party _ split over whether to follow the urging
of its counsel, Robert M. Bennett, that the case against McCain and
Glenn be dropped. The committee Democrats resisted, and McCain has
long insisted they did so because he was the sole Republican among
the five and they feared that a pared-down ``Keating Three'' would
be recast as a Democratic scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the committee concluded it was not improper for
five senators to seek two separate meetings with regulators, even
though Keating orchestrated the April 1987 meetings. The first
meeting was with bank board chairman Edwin J. Gray, at a time when
Gray was seeking Senate approval for a $15 billion bailout bill to
rescue hundreds of failing thrifts. Gray was summoned to a meeting
in DeConcini's office and told to come alone. The second meeting, a
week later, was with regulators who were directly overseeing the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Wertheimer, then president of Common Cause, which filed the
official complaint that prompted the Ethics investigation, said the
committee's decision on the propriety of the meetings was
unfortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meetings themselves were wrong and should not have
occurred. The five senators involved put undue and inappropriate
pressure on regulators,'' Wertheimer said. The meetings, Common
Cause argued in 1990, were ``seemingly designed to put the maximum
senatorial pressure on the board to accede to Keating's wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's own role remains a puzzle. Before the meetings, he had
a falling out with Keating when he learned that Keating wanted the
senators to negotiate on his behalf. McCain, new to the Senate and
concerned about recent publicity over Keating's fund-raising for
him, said he would attend the meetings only to assure himself that
regulators were treating Keating fairly.
</P>
<P>
   But at both meetings, first with Gray and then with thrift
regulators flown in from San Francisco, McCain looked on as
DeConcini pushed the regulators to give Lincoln a dispensation on a
board regulation that barred further risky investments _ a ban that
Lincoln had already exceeded by $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Gray told a House committee that the meetings
were an attempt to ``subvert'' the regulatory process.
</P>
<P>
   William Black, one of the regulators who attended the second
meeting, said in an interview that Keating clearly intended to
intimidate the bank board by assembling ``one-twentieth of the US
Senate, to include two bona fide American heroes, a Democratic
leader (Cranston) and the man who was about to become chairman of
the Banking Committee (Riegle).''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, despite his later insistence that he had refused to
negotiate on Keating's behalf, did not raise objections to
DeConcini's advocacy for Keating, according to Black. But Dowd,
McCain's attorney, said McCain ``did nothing improper, and he
didn't know that. . .DeConcini was going to misbehave.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The public's perception
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the committee struggled in private to sort out the scandal,
another battle was joined, this one over public perceptions of the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The weapon of choice? News leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Without leaks, there would be little fuel to stoke Washington's
political fires. In a city where matters of significance are often
disclosed by sources, journalists build reputations by obtaining
leaks. Anonymous leaks of unauthorized information helped topple
President Nixon and seriously damaged President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has mastered press relations like no other
presidential candidate in recent history, has been no less adroit
in courting reporters in the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years ago, when McCain was first linked to Keating, along
with the other four, his relations with Washington reporters served
him well. A former aide to McCain, who declined to be identified,
said the senator's strategy from the outset was ``to create the
clear impression he did little wrong, but that others had.''
</P>
<P>
   In October 1989, when McCain held a Phoenix news conference to
acknowledge he had made mistakes, his office leaked a memorandum
that made DeConcini's role look more incriminating, according to
the 1991-92 leak investigation by Fleming.
</P>
<P>
   The Oct. 17, 1989, Arizona Republic carried an account of
McCain's news conference, under the headline, ``McCain Meets the
Press, Shouldering the Blame,'' and a separate story about the
damaging memo from DeConcini's office. The second story bore the
subhead, ``Memo Backs McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleming, in his report, wrote that the leaked memo ``had come to
the press from Senator McCain's office, and the juxtaposition of
the two articles is disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, as the Ethics Committee argued in private over
Bennett's recommendation that Glenn and McCain be dropped as
targets of the inquiry, Dowd, McCain's attorney, wrote letters to
the committee on Sept. 24 and 28, 1990, imploring the committee to
make Bennett's report public.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, The New York Times, citing ``congressional
officials,'' reported Bennett's recommendation that Glenn and
McCain be cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Assessing the source of that leak, Fleming concluded there was
``substantial evidence'' that the five senators and their attorneys
knew Bennett's recommendation. Fleming wrote in his report that
Riegle, DeConcini, and Cranston had no motivation to leak
information ``adverse'' to them. As for Glenn, he wrote, ``there is
simply a total lack of evidence implicating Glenn.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fleming wrote: ``Senator McCain, his staff as well as his
counsel all deny that they knew Bennett's recommendation. These
denials are contradicted by the evidence.'' However, he wrote,
``there is no direct evidence to show that McCain made the
disclosures to The New York Times.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, after McCain testified before the committee in
private on Oct. 4, a subsequent Associated Press article appeared
in the Phoenix Gazette, headlined ``Source: Nothing new found
against McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   The article, Fleming wrote, ``was accurate to a point
approaching transcript form.'' He concluded: ``Senator McCain and
his staff had reason to want such an article. As reflected in the
headline. . .the article was not designed merely to report what had
occurred, but also to reflect the fact that Senator McCain's
testimony was exculpatory.'' Fleming reached no conclusion about
the source for the article.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week, Fleming wrote, ``a sea of fresh leaks, all of
which were aimed at DeConcini, Cranston, and Riegle,'' occurred.
The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal,
and The Washington Times all reported damaging evidence about the
three Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming, his inquiry frustrated because reporters refused to
cooperate, ultimately declared that there were ``multiple
sources,'' and that sensitive documents were ``distributed in an
attempt to influence the proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Cranston complained bitterly to the committee about the
leaks in a letter that suggested McCain was responsible. DeConcini,
in a recent interview, said he has little doubt that McCain was
responsible, but he said Fleming could not find enough
corroborating evidence to say so. Whatever evidence Fleming did
assemble is now in the National Archives _ under seal for 42 more
years. Fleming declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who led the earlier GAO investigation, said the
circumstantial evidence against McCain was overwhelming, and he
said there was documentary evidence to buttress the GAO's
suspicions, although he said he was barred from discussing it.
</P>
<P>
   When he interviewed McCain, and laid out the evidence, Hall
said, McCain lost his temper. ``Senator McCain has a reputation as
a stand-up guy, but his reaction that day was to point the finger
at others. He said I ought to look at DeConcini, I ought to look at
Riegle, and at their attorneys,'' Hall recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who is now a corporate investigator, said he found
McCain's finger-pointing ``contemptible'' and ``consistent with the
leaks themselves, which were intended to shift the blame
elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Former senator Rudman, asked about his book's conclusion that
McCain was responsible for many of the leaks, initially said that
McCain was justified in leaking because the committee had rejected
Bennett's plea that McCain and Glenn be excused because their roles
were minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that McCain denied under oath that he was responsible
for any news leaks, Rudman said his friend ``would never lie under
oath. He's an honorable man.'' Rudman then added that he had no
evidence that McCain had leaked anything.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Rudman called to say the leaks might have come from
``someone close to'' McCain without his knowledge. The statement in
the book, he added, ``was just Warren Rudman's opinion. When you're
writing a book, sometimes you're not that careful.''

LABOR CONTRACTS NOT TO BLAME FOR BIG DIG WOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; If you believe some general contractors, a major reason why
there is a $1.4 billion cost overrun on the Big Dig is the
existence of the state's Project Labor Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   By eliminating what its critics call the ``union-only'' project
labor agreement, which they say adds 5 to 10 percent to the cost of
a construction job, Big Dig savings could be 10 percent, or $1.42
billion, almost equal to the $10.8 billion project's cost overrun.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with this argument against PLAs is that they are
based on distortions and omissions of facts.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-PLA contractors tried these arguments in the courts and
lost. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, for example, upheld
the PLA involving the construction of Malden public schools. They
tried to have it eliminated in the Legislature, but lost.
</P>
<P>
   Malden Mayor Richard Howard praised the court's decision to
uphold the PLA, saying in the Malden News that the quality of the
school projects and the fact that they were finished on time is
testament to the agreement's significance.
</P>
<P>
   A survey showed the courts have found PLAs lawful in at least 28
cases and found legal problems with PLAs in only six cases. These
legal problems, based on challenges raised on bidding, antitrust
and labor laws, have been addressed and ``found to be without
merit.''
</P>
<P>
   Now anti-PLA contractors are hoping to have PLAs eliminated in
the court of public opinion using the Big Dig cost overruns as
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   One argument employed by an anti-PLA group, the Merit
Construction Alliance, an association of nonunion contractors, is
that construction projects with PLAs are open only to contractors
which employ only union workers. That's simply not so.
</P>
<P>
   Under PLAs, which are jointly negotiated between labor and
management, workers give up their right to strike, and contractors
pledge not to lock out workers. In addition, nonunion contractors,
after a period of time working under a PLA, must pay their workers
the same wages and benefits paid to union workers, and provide them
with the same protections union workers enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Some nonunion contractors have said PLAs actually keep them from
bidding on projects. But that was disproven when Douglas MacDonald,
executive director of the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority,
reported that of 257 subcontractors on the Boston Harbor Cleanup
Project, 102 have been nonunion. In fact, the MWRA praised the PLA
on the project for reducing costs from $6.1 billion to $3.4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   What some nonunion contractors such as Merit are not saying is
that they don't want to pay workers the same wages, benefits, and
protections of union workers as required under PLAs.
</P>
<P>
   Even without PLAs, all contractors, union and nonunion, must pay
prevailing wages, which are based on collective bargaining
agreements in the geographical areas of that project, on all public
and private projects.
</P>
<P>
   Many nonunion contractors tried unsuccessfully to repeal the
state's prevailing wage law, which has been in existence for more
than 80 years. And now they are trying to eliminate the PLAs, which
have been in existence in this state and throughout the nation for
more than 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   What PLA critics are not saying is that the only reason they
want it eliminated is because they don't want to pay the wages or
benefits, or provide the protections to nonunion workers who would
come under these agreements.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, PLAs are not why the Big Dig has a $1.4 billion cost
overrun. Federal auditors examining the project will soon find the
real reasons.

FLEETBOSTON HAMPERED BY PROBLEMS OF PEERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FleetBoston Financial Corp. must feel like a guy who owns a nice
home in a bad neighborhood: No matter how much he fixes it up, he
can't get anyone to buy it for what it is really worth.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet lives in a bad neighborhood called bank stocks. Bank
stocks have been crushed in recent months. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
index of regional banks has dropped 35 percent since its 1999 high.
</P>
<P>
   The banks are suffering from multiple ills: rising interest
rates, the perception that they are old-economy companies, and the
well-publicized troubles of a few big banks. The problem banks _
Bank One, First Union, Bank of America _ all made major
acquisitions in the past two years and later announced
disappointing earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet made a big acquisition last year when it bought
BankBoston. Fleet hasn't announced disappointing earnings. In fact,
the bank has had nothing but good news to report. Unfortunately,
investors seem to be practicing a form of guilt by association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is waiting to see if another shoe drops here,''
complained Eugene McQuade, Fleet's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts don't expect that to happen. Most are bullish on
Fleet's prospects. They say that when interest rates top out,
possibly later this year, Fleet stock will be well worth owning.
``Once we see a turn in this sector, Fleet should be one of the
better performers,'' said Lisa Welch, a bank analyst with John
Hancock Funds.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet stock has a lot of lost ground to make up. The stock has
shed 38 percent of its value in the last four months. With a gain
Monday, it is back to 27, just where it was three years ago. Over
the same time frame, the Nasdaq index has climbed 250 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's actual performance has been surprisingly good. Earnings
climbed 14 percent last year and are expected to rise another 11
percent this year. Gerard Cassidy, a bank analyst with Tucker
Anthony, says Fleet has the best chance of any major bank in the
country of beating its earnings estimates for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Why the enthusiasm? Much of it is based on the growing strength
of Fleet businesses that lie outside the conventional banking
realm.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson Stephens, the investment bank acquired by BankBoston,
claims to have been the lead manager on more Internet deals than
any of its competitors last year. Robertson Stephens revenues
doubled last year to $950 million and the bank recently announced
its best January ever.
</P>
<P>
   Quick &AMP; Reilly, the discount brokerage, saw its earnings climb
40 percent in 1999. Fleet's private equity business had a huge 1999
and currently is sitting on at least $1.5 billion in unrealized
gains, much of that in Internet companies. ``My sense is the gain
ultimately will turn out to be a multiple of that number ($1.5
billion),'' said McQuade.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the BankBoston deal, Wall Street was worried
about the South American operations BankBoston brought along. The
Brazilian economy was in a funk and the fear was bank earnings
would turn funky as well. It never happened. International earnings
rose to $330 million in 1999, up from $240 million the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's basic banking business is more pedestrian, but even
there, McQuade expects double-digit gains this year.
</P>
<P>
   What could cloud Fleet's sunny outlook? An economic slowdown,
for one thing. Fleet can make money even if interest rates rise,
say analysts, but a weaker economy would curtail new business and
possibly expose credit problems.
</P>
<P>
   A severe market correction would hurt too, especially if the
technology stocks that support Robertson Stephens and Quick &AMP;
Reilly took a nosedive.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a collapse of Fleet's deal to sell 278 branches to
Sovereign Bancorp also would do some damage. Fleet has been
promising that the transaction is on the verge of approval, but
investors want to see the sale consummated soon. ``The uncertainty
is driving the market crazy,'' said Steven Wharton, an analyst with
Loomis Sayles.
</P>
<P>
   Still, nearly all of those who follow Fleet are upbeat about the
stock's long-term fortunes. They believe the market has punished
Fleet unfairly for sins committed by others. They don't expect the
stock to move much before Alan Greenspan is finished hiking rates,
but most think it is not too early to buy on the anticipation of
better times ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock isn't going to double or triple,'' said Kevin
Timmons, an analyst with First Albany. But Timmons thinks the stock
will rise and that it represents good value.
</P>
<P>
   For an old-economy company, that is probably the most you can
hope for.

BOB SMITH OF N.H. IS SEEN WARMING UP TO ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT BRAILE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Audubon Society two months ago decided it could no
longer avoid the unavoidable. It had to meet with Senator Bob
Smith, the archconservative New Hampshire Republican who had just
been named Environment and Public Works Committee chairman, one of
the most powerful environmental seats on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists over the years have considered Smith ``a
monster'' who relentlessly assaults their causes, said Dan Beard,
Audubon's senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Beard was unprepared for the Bob Smith he met.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found him charming, accessible, reasonable, and not a
monster at all,'' he said. ``To be honest,'' he said as if in
disbelief, ``he was very supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, there appears to be a new Bob Smith on the
block. He bears a marked political humility and concern about
nature that even environmentalists say has become increasingly
evident since he returned to the Republican Party on Nov. 1, after
failing to gain any campaign momentum in his independent run for
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to look to the next generation on the environment,''
said Smith, 58, in an interview shortly before presiding at his
first major committee hearing last week on the US Environmental
Protection Agency's proposed $7.3 billion budget for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians look to the next election and businessmen to the
next bottom line. We have to throw both out the window,'' Smith
said. ``I don't want to spend $9 billion to restore the Everglades
just to get reelected. I want to spend it so that my
great-great-great-grandchildren can walk through the Everglades and
see alligators and herons.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, environmentalists say, this is the same Smith who, as a
two-term senator and three-term congressman, sought to ``reform''
the federal Superfund program in ways that would gut it. Smith has
also opposed President Clinton's plan to protect 40 million acres
of national forest land. He has also sought to amend the federal
Clean Air Act in ways that would make it easier for industries to
comply.
</P>
<P>
   Smith earned a zero score from the League of Conservation Voters
on Feb. 10 for his voting record last year. He jokes about
environmentalists when speaking to industry groups; a quip to the
National Association of Manufacturers last December in Washington
involved eating bald eagles and other protected species. He
lambastes the EPA and other federal environmental agencies in
interviews with his home-state newspapers as totalitarian
bureaucracies out to strangle New Hampshire economically. He cannot
even stay in good stead with environmentalists in his party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is beginning to feel like an opportunist,'' said
Martha Marks, president of Republicans for Environmental
Protection, referring to Smith's defection and sudden return as a
Republican. He came back one week after the Oct. 24 death of Rhode
Island Senator John Chafee, the former committee chairman who was
deeply respected by environmentalists and in both major parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``He bagged the party, and now he's back, and it really saddens
me, because Senator Chafee did wonderful things in many ways, and I
have no reason to believe Senator Smith is on the same page,''
Marks said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Smith supports a $7.8 billion federal plan to restore the
Everglades, which faces review by his committee and would set an
initial $1.7 billion appropriation this session. He is also
considering legislation to ban the gasoline additive MTBE, which
many environmentalists allege is polluting drinking water supplies.
He wants to explore solutions to the Gulf of Mexico ``dead zone,''
caused in part by silt from the Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   After last week's hearing, Smith softened his view on a newly
proposed EPA rule to clean up America's rivers, having been assured
by EPA Administrator Carol Browner that it would not usurp state
authority. He also expressed concern during the hearing about the
EPA's proposed $550 million cut in state funds used in part to
build and maintain wastewater treatment plants.
</P>
<P>
   If his own party fights him, as is expected, then he says it
will have to live with the anti-environmental label so often
assigned to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan to use the chairmanship to protect the environment of
this country,'' Smith said. ``Keep in mind, some of the criticism
of the Republican Party is deserved. If it's unwilling to spend $9
billion over 37 years to clean up the Everglades, then it deserves
the label,'' he said, referring to the project's long-term cost.
</P>
<P>
   Whether revamped or not, Smith has a tough row to hoe in moving
his agenda in a presidential and congressional election year. The
environment has yet to emerge as a serious presidential campaign
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP holds slim House and Senate majorities, and so will be
reluctant to advance any reform legislation, fearing a reprisal
from Democrats and environmentalists in November. As both parties
have moved to the middle, Smith has stayed to the right on issues
from abortion to assault weapons. And with the elections coming,
the session is expected to be short
</P>
<P>
   But Smith remains undaunted. ``The Republican Party has a great
opportunity to go back to the tradition of Teddy Roosevelt and
conserve the environment,'' he said. ``And I think that's what we
should do.''

PLUCK, LEAKS HELPED MCCAIN OVERCOME S&AMP;L SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A decade ago, Senator John McCain's role in the most politically
corrosive episode of the $150 billion savings and loan debacle
threatened to end a political career that now holds some promise of
concluding instead with a McCain presidency. Back then, McCain said
the Keating Five scandal was a more nightmarish experience than his
years in a North Vietnamese prison camp.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a decade makes: One mischievous commentator
recently suggested that the Keating Five was a rock group. And
nowadays, McCain dismisses the tawdry Senate scandal as a mere
asterisk in his career, in hopes the electorate will too.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the scandal remains the other crucible of McCain's career,
and its every filament is likely to be picked apart if McCain wins
the Republican nomination, as now seems plausible.
</P>
<P>
   With the passage of time, McCain's role has come to be seen as
relatively benign. But had it not been for good fortune and
determination _ and carefully targeted news leaks that McCain
subsequently denied responsibility for _ McCain might have been
badly tarnished.
</P>
<P>
   He was a close friend and early congressional ally of Charles H.
Keating Jr. _ the figure at the core of scandal _ and one of the
leading beneficiaries of Keating's political and personal largesse.
Yet, he benefited from decisions by the Senate Ethics Committee
that minimized his culpability and the resulting sanction.
</P>
<P>
   And there is evidence that McCain averted major damage to his
public image with well-choreographed news leaks from his office
that undermined three of the four other senators caught up in the
controversy. In 1992, McCain denied under oath that he or his aides
had anything to do with the leaks.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal's raw content is unflattering: McCain and four other
senators _ indelibly known ever since as the Keating Five _
pressuring federal regulators on behalf of Keating, a prodigious
fund-raiser and owner of the Lincoln Savings &AMP; Loan Association.
His bank's subsequent $3.4 billion failure made Keating the most
enduring symbol of the devil-may-care S&AMP;L excesses of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the record shows that McCain did less for Keating
than most of the others, and abandoned Keating the moment he
learned there might be criminal charges against his friend. The
Senate Ethics Committee gave McCain, along with Senator John Glenn,
the lightest of reprimands, saying they displayed ``poor judgment''
for going to two meetings with banking regulators.
</P>
<P>
   And McCain, who has endeared himself to many voters for
cheerfully acknowledging that he too has been compromised from time
to time by the very special interests he now rails against, admits
there was an ``appearance'' of impropriety in his intercession for
Keating.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Ethics Committee concluded that the meetings
themselves were not improper, despite evidence that the five
senators so intimidated regulators that action against Lincoln was
delayed for a year. The added cost to taxpayers because of the
delay: a billion dollars, by some estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Two investigations of the leaked news stories that often
portrayed McCain favorably, one by the General Accounting Office
and a later inquiry by a special counsel, Peter Fleming Jr., were
inconclusive, and did not directly implicate anyone.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview this month, Clark B. Hall, a former FBI
agent and congressional investigator who led the GAO investigation,
told the Globe he had no doubt, after doing scores of interviews
and obtaining documentary evidence, that McCain was one of the
principal leakers. But Hall said the Ethics Committee ``smoothed it
over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't betray other people to protect yourself, and that's
what he was doing,'' Hall said. ``And he was breaking Senate rules
to do it.'' The targets of the leaks were Democrats Dennis
DeConcini of Arizona, Alan Cranston of California, and Donald
Riegle of Michigan. (In the end, DeConcini and Riegle would be
sharply criticized by the committee; Cranston drew a formal
reprimand.)
</P>
<P>
   Fleming's own report in 1992, which was virtually ignored by
Washington news outlets that were recipients of the leaks, left a
clear inference that the circumstantial evidence points to McCain's
office as the source for some pivotal leaks.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, former senator Warren Rudman, the co-chairman of
McCain's presidential campaign who was vice chairman of the Ethics
Committee at the time, states flatly in his 1996 autobiography that
McCain and his staff were among those responsible for the leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Through a spokesman, McCain declined to be interviewed about the
matter. But his attorney and friend, John W. Dowd, said the
investigation by the bipartisan Senate Ethics Committee was a
``travesty and a farce'' and ``the most corrupt'' ever held by the
Senate; that the case against his client was entirely without
merit; and that the committee's chairman, Democrat Howell Heflin of
Alabama, who is now retired, ``was a son of a bitch who wanted to
rub salt in John's wounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Dowd also had harsh words for the Globe. ``The Bush campaign
must be paying for your time,'' he said. As for the leaks, Dowd
said: ``If you guys want to go and masturbate about these leaks, go
ahead. But I had no part in them.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A pugnacious strategy
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Keating also adopted a pugnacious strategy
in his attempts to outfox, intimidate, and even seize control of
the federal regulatory apparatus that sniffed big trouble in the
way his Lincoln Savings &AMP; Loan Association was lending depositors'
money for risky ventures. Many of the loans were for real estate
developments by Keating's Phoenix-based American Continental Corp.,
which purchased the California-based Lincoln S&AMP;L in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   As federal banking regulators closed in, Keating deployed
powerful allies against them. He raised enormous sums for members
of Congress _ $1.3 million for the five senators alone, $112,000 of
that for McCain's campaigns. He and his lobbyists prevailed on
McCain and others to write letters and support congressional
resolutions condemning Federal Home Loan Bank Board regulations
that would restrict risky direct investments like those Lincoln's
deposits were used for.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Keating himself left no doubt that the campaign funds
he lavished on the five senators were designed to produce results,
when he declared to reporters: ``One question, among the many
others raised in recent weeks, had to do with whether my financial
support in any way influenced several political figures to take up
my cause. I want to say in the most forceful way I can: I certainly
hope so.''
</P>
<P>
   Months before he pushed the five senators to meet with
regulators, Keating even sought to seize control of the bank board
by asking his congressional allies to support two of his choices
for the three-member board that was overseeing the investigation of
Lincoln. One of the two, Lee H. Henkel Jr., was appointed to the
board in November 1986.
</P>
<P>
   During the Ethics Committee investigation, one of the leaked
stories that benefited McCain reported that DeConcini and Riegle,
at Keating's behest, had lobbied the White House for Henkel's
appointment. But in a little noticed finding in its final report,
the committee reported that McCain had, too.
</P>
<P>
   Alone among the five senators, McCain counted Keating as a
personal friend; their families vacationed together from 1983 to
1986 _ the four years McCain served in the House _ flying to
Keating's private retreat in the Bahamas aboard corporate aircraft
paid for by Keating's company.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, McCain's wife, Cindy, and her father, James W. Hensley,
also invested $359,100 in a Phoenix shopping mall developed by a
subsidiary of Keating's American Continental Corp.
</P>
<P>
   When the scandal became public, and along with it his family's
personal and business links to Keating, McCain reimbursed Keating
$13,433 for the flights and vacations. By not reporting them and
reimbursing Keating at the time they occurred, McCain had violated
House ethics rules. (He was elected to the Senate in 1986.)

 `SMELLS AND BELLS' OF LENT CAN'T BE FOUND ON THE WEB
 (Commentary)   &HT;    (To purchase this ``separate buy'' article from the New York
Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative DEBRA

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A recent survey found that those who are online enjoy less human
contact than those who are not. Does this electronic trend toward
isolation threaten religious life that traditionally has been
centered on congregations?
 &HT;    Journalist Mary Alice Williams, on the PBS program ``Religion
and Ethics Newsweekly,'' recently observed that ``With tens of
thousands of religious Web sites and a home page for every
organized faith group and then some, people can get a dose of
religion without ever getting out of their jammies.
 &HT;    ``Some prophesy the Web will reduce us to a virtual community of
believers practicing a kind of `McFaith' _ fast, convenient, but
hardly nourishing.''
 &HT;    Web-McFaith stands in stark contrast to the upcoming church
season: Lent. Beginning with Ash Wednesday on March 8, Christians
will make their annual liturgical pilgrimage toward Good Friday and
Easter.
 &HT;    Every year, the spiritual practices of those 40 days impinge on
my hectic spring schedule _ they are neither fast nor convenient.
 &HT;    But they are nourishing. With varying degrees of success or
commitment over the last two decades, I have tried to take Lent
seriously. Most years I find Lenten spirituality difficult; some
years easy. But nearly every year, I have come to understand
myself, God, liturgy, scriptures, and my church community in
greater spiritual depth through Lent.
 &HT;    I know many Christians who eagerly await Lent. Some actually
converted or returned to faith as a result of Lenten observance.
Their faith stories are often quite similar: Lent introduced them
to ``real church,'' a serious, rigorous and intentional spiritual
community.
 &HT;    What observers have failed to notice is that as our society
speeds up (the Internet being only the latest technological
manifestation of such) religious faith and practice must slow down.
 &HT;    Admittedly, there are nearly 30,000 religion Web sites with
nearly 25 million regular visitors. I'm one. But where do I go for
``serious'' spirituality? Not to the Web. I go to church.
 &HT;    It seems almost deviant to say so, but traditional church
appears to be making a comeback among computer savvy baby-boomers
and Generation Xers. In contrast to the disembodied spirituality of
cyberspace, people seem eager for sensual religious
experiencekneeling, incense, bread and wine, fasting, communal
prayer, congregational singing. The more ``smells and bells'' the
better.
 &HT;    Thus, the Internet actually creates a need for human connection
to the divine. The stuff of traditional religionfrom liturgies to
pie supperscannot (yet) be experienced over the Web. It exists only
in musty old buildings whose wood is scented with decades of candle
smoke; through whose windows colored light plays across the carpet.
 &HT;    Something mystical and mysterious happens inside those
buildings_ something beyond our greatest technological
achievements. Those old buildings are sacred space, places where
the human and divine have touched for generations.
 &HT;    And I mean really touched.
 &HT;    Last year, the Benedictine monks of St. John's Abbey in
Collegeville, Minn., unveiled the first page of a new hand-written
Bible they have commissioned. It is the first hand-written Bible to
be produced in the West since the introduction of the printing
press and will not be completed until 2004.
 &HT;    The St. John's Bible is not intended to glorify a fading past,
but rather it is meant to be a ``21st-century Bible for the 21st
century.'' The monks want to ``link human imagination and the human
hand with the word of God'' thus making the ``word of God live on a
page.''
 &HT;    The primary artist, English calligrapher Donald Jackson, says
the quill pen is ``part of yourself; made of the same stuff as
fingernail.'' Like all artists' tools, it is ``an extension of
one's own fingers.'' And in the touching of finger to page, the
word of God creates a ``visual harmonic'' which strikes a
``universal chord.''
 &HT;    Human touch _ whether a hand-written Bible, Bach played on the
organ, or bread baked for the Eucharist_ is the only real access we
have to the divine. Because spirituality is itself disembodied, it
needs human bodies to be known.
 &HT;    The Internet, itself disembodied, cannot ultimately serve this
purpose. It does not come through the touch of a keyboard. We human
beings need material stuff to know that which is Spirit; we need
one another to touch the Divine.
 &HT;    Like the St. John's Bible, like Lent, spirituality cannot be
fast. Wisdom, insight, knowing oneself and God, serving and caring
for one another, marriage, friendship, parenthoodall take time.
 &HT;    The Internet may be a clever tool to assist our quests, but it
is not the artist's tool, it is not the community found in the
fellowship hall, and it is not the joy found through the rigor of
lifelong Lenten discipline.
 &HT;    You do not need high-speed access to find it; you only need go
down the street.

fingernail.'' Like all artists' tools, it is ``an extension of
one's own fingers.'' And in the touching of finger to page, the
word of God creates a ``visual harmonic'' which strikes a
``universal chord.''
 &HT;    Human touch _ whether a hand-written Bible, Bach played on the
organ, or bread baked for the Eucharist_ is the only real access we
have to the divine. Because spirituality is itself disembodied, it
needs human bodies to be known.
 &HT;    The Internet, itself disembodied, cannot ultimately serve this
purpose. It does not come through the touch of a keyboard. We human
beings need material stuff to know that which is Spirit; we need
one another to touch the Divine.
 &HT;    Like the St. John's Bible, like Lent, spirituality cannot be
fast. Wisdom, insight, knowing oneself and God, serving and caring
for one another, marriage, friendship, parenthoodall take time.
 &HT;    The Internet may be a clever tool to assist our quests, but it
is not the artist's tool, it is not the community found in the
fellowship hall, and it is not the joy found through the rigor of
lifelong Lenten discipline.
 &HT;    You do not need high-speed access to find it; you only need go
down the street.

   Food and dining stories from The N.Y. Times News Service for
Wednesday, March 1:
</P>
<P>
   RESTAURANT-MONITOR (New York) _ While you savor your tuna
tartare in an elegant dining room, your companion may not be the
only one to notice you are ignoring the sesame toasts the chef made
to accompany it. The chef may be fretting about it, too. While he
observes you from video screens in the kitchen. As you blithely eat
your meal, he may be watching for just when you put your fork down,
so he can get your next course rolling. Even in restaurants that
have not invested in video technology, your name, phone number,
address and even where you work may be stored away on a computer
hard drive without your knowledge. Computers have been in
restaurants for years but until recently they were used only for
conveying orders from the dining room to the kitchen. Now they can
track how much wine you drink, how often you order the foie gras,
how much you tip and how many times you didn't show up for a
reservation. By Amanda Hesser.
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT1.
</P>
<P>
   COOKIES&AMP;MILK (New York) _ At the city's most sophisticated

   With recipes.
</P>
<P>
   With photos, NYT2,3.
</P>
<P>
   WINE-TALK (Undated) _ The column: Wine is generally credited for
the civilizing influence it's supposed to have on the people who
drink it. Like many civilizing influences, it's spawned a horde of
customs and protocols. Some are useful, like red wine with meat,
some sentimental, like passing the Port to the left, some obsolete,
like long-stemmed glasses, and some just silly, like sniffing
corks. Here's how to sort them out. By Frank J. Prial.
</P>
<P>
   SIMPLE-COOKING (Undated) _ The column: Cassoulet in a hurry,
relatively speaking. By Mark Bittman.
</P>
<P>
   With recipe.
</P>
<P>
   AVOCADOS (Undated) _ Avocados are in their prime right now,
bringing a bit of summer. By Steven Raichlen.
</P>
<P>
   With recipes.
</P>
<P>
   MASTER-CHEF (Undated) _ The column: Salmon confit. By Christian
Delouvrier.
</P>
<P>
   With recipe.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   VIETNAM-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Mark Bittman reviews ``Authentic
Vietnamese Cooking'' by Corinne Trang.
</P>
<P>
   With recipe.
</P>
<P>
   DESSERTS (Undated) _ What to do when a dessert fails at the last
minute: shop and improvise. By Marian Burros.
</P>
<P>
   With recipe.
</P>
<P>
   TASTINGS (Undated) _ The column: Chablis. By Eric Asimov.
</P>
<P>

three-star restaurant. By Florence Fabricant.

WHO WANTS TO BE A BAKE-OFF MILLIONAIRE?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   So who is this year's Bake-Off millionaire? Roberta (Bobbie)
Sonefeld of Hopkins, S.C., captured the $1 million grand prize
Tuesday morning at the 39th Pillsbury Bake-Off 50th anniversary
contest in San Franciso with her Cream Cheese Brownie Pie. The
recipe, which Sonefeld created just for the contest, was the Fast
and Fabulous Desserts and Treats category winner.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Sonefeld and 98 other finalists (one finalist was
unable to compete at the last minute due to a medical emergency)
from 36 states and ranging in age from 11 to 82 years old cooked
their dishes for the judges in mini-kitchens in a ballroom at the
Marriott hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The judges described Sonefeld's recipe as a combination of
indulgence and convenience. The layered creation, which takes just
15 minutes to prepare, uses a brownie mix and a refrigerated pie
crust and is filled with a cream cheese mixture. Cream cheese is a
key ingredient in the recipe's success, noted the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most brownie pies I make are dry, but the cream cheese helps
to keep it creamy. It's easy, inexpensive and my two sons love
it,'' said Sonefeld, a passionate baker, who is an administrative
assistant for a commercial mortgage banking company. Her dream is
to someday open a bakery or pie shop with her sister.
</P>
<P>
   Three other category winners each earned $10,000. Judith Mettlin
of Synder, N.Y., prepared the winning Island Paradise Salad in the
Yummy Vegetables category. Lorraine Maggio of Manlius, N.Y., baked
the winning Easy Weeknight Meals dish, Ham and Swiss Crescent
Braid. In the Casual Snacks and Appetizers category, Judy Wood of
Vestavia Hills, Ala., won with Pesto Crescent Twists With Feta
Spread.
</P>
<P>
   Three finalists in each of the four categories won $2,000 _
including Southern Californian Heather Wight (see accompanying
story).
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the GE Innovation Award (and a GE Profile
Performance Kitchen (valued at $5,000) was Pat Parsons of
Bakersfield for her recipe, Guess Again Candy Crunch, selected as
most innovative by the judges.
</P>
<P>
   Recipes were judged on taste, appearance, consumer appeal,
creativity and appropriate use of eligible products. The final
selection was a combination of two components: scoring from the
judges who tasted the dishes on Monday, and consumer research
results conducted prior to Monday that asked consumers to score the
dishes (by looking at recipes and photos) on appeal and the
likelihood of their making the dish.
</P>
<P>
   A book containing the 100 finalists' recipes (each with a color
photo) should be available soon at supermarkets and newsstands for
$3.50. To order by mail, send $3.99 (includes postage and handling)
per copy to: Pillsbury Publications, Department 8077, P.O. Box
2063, Harlan, Iowa 51539.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that the prize-winning recipes that follow won
using Pillsbury products, and substituting other brands might not
produce the same results. &QL;

SOUTHLAND PILLSBURY BAKE-OFF FINALISTS COMPETE FOR THE DOUGH
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four cooks from the greater Los Angeles area were among the 99
finalists competing Monday in the 39th Pillsbury Bake-Off in San
Francisco. And Heather Wight of West Hollywood walked away with
$2,000 with her Banana-Nut Cupcakes With Maple Frosting. Wight,
along with Candy Barnhart of Hollywood, Elizabeth Castle of Sunland
and Mary Capone of Long Beach, were all first-time finalists in the
Pillsbury contest.
</P>
<P>
   Wight, 21, moved to California eight months ago from Bethlehem,
Pa., and entered this, her first recipe contest, on a dare from a
co-worker who knew she liked to cook. She submitted five specially
developed recipes including Banana-Nut Cupcakes. Based on the
banana birthday cake she baked for her grandfather's 90th birthday
a year and a half ago, she turned the idea into cupcakes using a
Pillsbury banana quick bread mix and the same frosting as on the
cake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pleasant surprise to be selected as a finalist,''
said Wight, who sent her entries via the Internet on the last day
of the contest.
</P>
<P>
   Wight, who currently works as an administrative assistant for a
catering company in Beverlywood, grew up cooking in an Italian
household with lots of good food prepared by her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cooking is fun for me _ and a hobby. I have a natural instinct
for cooking everything and adapt to whatever occasion I'm cooking
for. Presentation is always important to me.'' Wight's dream is to
go to culinary school and pursue a career in this area.
</P>
<P>
   For Barnhart, 53, a homemaker, homeowner association archivist
and volunteer librarian, being selected as a finalist was the
ultimate honor for the amateur cook, who considers herself
creative. ``I felt like I was being nominated for an Academy
Award.'' Barnhart _ who dabbles in cooking and has entered several
recipe contests including the Bake-Off numerous times over the last
30 years _ submitted five favorite creations with the quick and
easy contest theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was inspired to enter this year because it was the 50th
anniversary of the Bake-Off and a new millennium; the time was
right. I didn't create these recipes just for the contest. I'm not
an armchair tester (referring to those who enter recipes in
contests without kitchen testing them).''
</P>
<P>
   Three were pulled from a little envelope of prized recipes she
has collected for years and kept in a kitchen drawer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very particular _ and only have 25 special recipes in that
envelope.'' The Grands Roast Beef Sandwiches with mustard sauce is
one of them that she has been serving for lunch or dinner to her
family for the past four years. She uses roast beef from the deli _
and Grands biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost didn't enter the recipe because it is too basic _ and
I lean more toward desserts and baked items.''
</P>
<P>
   Castle couldn't believe it when she was notified in November
that her recipe Slow-Cooked Taco Casserole was selected as a
Bake-Off finalist. She was so excited she dropped the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very special that I was picked. It's been the high
point of my life so far,'' said the 26-year old single mother of
three, who has won numerous ribbons and prizes in cooking contests
since the age of 15.
</P>
<P>
   Winning recipe contests runs in the family. Her mother, Marina
Castle, was a finalist in 1990 and Elizabeth accompanied her to the
Bake-Off in Phoenix that year. So this year Marina accompanied her
daughter to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth, a first time Bake-Off entrant, submitted 30 recipes,
20 of which she developed and tested especially for the contest.
``The recipe Pillsbury picked was my least favorite. It tastes
good, but I didn't think it had a good chance. But I love it now.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the recipe came when Castle wanted to make tacos
but didn't have enough clean dishes. Instead she tossed all of the
ingredients into a slow cooker and walked away. It's delicious
comfort food, great for an easy weeknight meal and kids like it.
</P>
<P>
   Castle, who considers herself an above-average cook, enjoys
experimenting. ``I like to cook big meals and main dishes _
including Thanksgiving dinner, pot roasts, and Mexican and Chinese
creations.''
</P>
<P>
   An avid cook for more than 40 years, the 51-year-old Capone was
so set on becoming a finalist that she sent in 36 recipes. ``It was
the $1 million grand prize that prompted me to enter my first
recipe contest ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Capone's collection entered were ethnic-style dishes such
as Mexican Two-Corn Stew and Thai Chicken Pizza, and desserts, such
as Apricot Almond Crescents and Grape Expectations. ``I had fun
creating them.''
</P>
<P>
   But the recipe that actually snagged her a spot as a finalist
was deceptively simple _ really a glorified fish stick. Halibut
With Corn and Lime-Cilantro Butter takes just 20 minutes to
prepare, involves a minimum of chopping and uses only one pan.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind the recipe, said Capone, who grew up in Maryland
and began cooking at the age of 10, was to make fish more palatable
to non-fish eaters. The corn dressing and the breading were
designed to disguise the fish. ``I was pleased that Pillsbury
picked the fish recipe, which was among my top four favorites
submitted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been pretty exciting to be a finalist _ everybody has
been so proud of me. The Bake-Off is a slice of Americana that
brings warm, nice feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   So what encouragement and tips would these finalists share with
future recipe contest entrants? ``Don't give up; I speak from
experience,'' said Barnhart. ``Pay attention to the contest
rules,'' recommended Wight. ``Enter a recipe that is easy and
tastes good,'' said Castle. ``Try to come up with something that is
relatively simple, but is different from day-to-day dishes and
stands out,'' advised Capone. &QL;

college basketball. College players were undergoing various

wholesome proposition. Unable to make any kind of wage for their
labors, the players are hounded for every dime or favor they
accept. This has popped up at Auburn, Cincinnati, UCLA and Michigan
as well as St. John's, while Connecticut has had its own discipline
problems. By George Vecsey.

   RESTAURANT-MONITOR (New York) _ While you savor your tuna
tartare in an elegant dining room, your companion may not be the
only one to notice you are ignoring the sesame toasts the chef made
to accompany it. The chef may be fretting about it, too. While he
observes you from video screens in the kitchen. As you blithely eat
your meal, he may be watching for just when you put your fork down,
so he can get your next course rolling. Even in restaurants that
have not invested in video technology, your name, phone number,
address and even where you work may be stored away on a computer
hard drive without your knowledge. Computers have been in
restaurants for years but until recently they were used only for
conveying orders from the dining room to the kitchen. Now they can
track how much wine you drink, how often you order the foie gras,
how much you tip and how many times you didn't show up for a
reservation. By Amanda Hesser.

   WINE-TALK (Undated) _ The column: Wine is generally credited for
the civilizing influence it's supposed to have on the people who
drink it. Like many civilizing influences, it's spawned a horde of
customs and protocols. Some are useful, like red wine with meat,
some sentimental, like passing the Port to the left, some obsolete,
like long-stemmed glasses, and some just silly, like sniffing
corks. Here's how to sort them out. By Frank J. Prial.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The Amadou Diallo story can, in some ways, be told by its
headlines: ``Cops Blast Unarmed Man''; ``1,000 Rally to Condemn
Shooting of Unarmed Man by Police''; ``A Mother Arrives From Africa
to Mourn Her Slain Son''; ``Slain Man's Mother Rejects Mayor's
Aid''; ``Battle-Tested Sharpton Slips Into Familiar Role'';
``Diallo Dead, Cops Look for Dirt''; ``Amadou Lied in His Claim for
Asylum''; ``Cardinal Holds a Meeting With Parents of Diallo'';
``Diallo's Mom Boots Dream Team''; ``Diallo's Parents Feuding Over
Estate That Could Be Worth Millions''; ``Diallo Dad Appeals to
Ex-Wife for Unity.''
 &HT;    They convey the Tom Wolfe-ian nature of the story, its tragedy
and circuslike aspects.
 &HT;    I spent the first day of Ramadan, Dec. 9, with Kadi Diallo,
Amadou's grieving mother.
 &HT;    At one point, our driver, an Israeli, deduced who she was and
effusively offered his condolences.
 &HT;    We visited a 96-year-old Guinean immigrant to the United States,
Mohammed Korka Diallo (no relation), at his senior citizen's
residence in Harlem. He was from their village, Kadi said. She had
visited him often for conversation and comfort since coming to New
York.
 &HT;    Korka wanted to get out of his apartment for a while, so we set
up a triangle of chairs in the building's austere lobby. He told me
how he had served in the U.S. Army in World War II, how he had been
the host of Sokou Touro, the future president of Guinea, on Touro's
trip to New York on the eve of the country's independence in 1958.
 &HT;    Of Amadou's death, he said angrily: ``That should never happen
here. Never! America's the greatest country on earth. And America
is the worst country on earth.''
 &HT;    Korka, with his rheumy eyes, gazed at Kadi admiringly. ``Each
time I look at her,'' he said, ``I feel like crying. How does she
hold herself? How does she go through life? It's too much _ but
she's strong. Such a strong person _ more than a man.''
 &HT;    Kadi began to weep. He patted her leg. ``Sometimes I cry, but
it's just to let it go,'' she said. Two women recognized her as we
left and expressed sorrow for her loss. She told me that people
recognized her everywhere.
 &HT;    Back in the car, she said she had been upset all day. ``Ah,
because no food in your stomach?'' I asked, referring to the fast
of Ramadan. No, she said, because she was so far away from home on
such an important holiday. ``Some days I just want to drop
everything and go back.''
 &HT;    She began to weep again. ``I lost my son,'' she said. ``He was
23 years old and 5 months. We all expect to die, but not _ like
that.''
 &HT;    Back in the apartment, I asked her about the trial of the four
policemen accused of killing Amadou. She would be there every day,
she said, to be sure that justice was done.
 &HT;    ``And if they are acquitted?'' I asked.
 &HT;    ``I will be very disappointed,'' she said.
 &HT;    Two days later she called me back. She had been thinking about
that quotation and wanted to improve on it. ``I hope and pray that
there will be a conviction _ that's why I'm calling for all the
people to stand together, so that there won't be this kind of
incident again.'' Use that, she said.
 &HT;    It reminded me of something she had also said about limiting her
public appearances so as not to abuse the sympathy people felt for
her: ``I have to think which is good to do as a grieving mother.''
 &HT;    Both quotations showed an awareness of the power of the image,
which is perhaps unseemly in a mourner _ but which, in the media
circus of New York, is probably indispensable.
 &HT;    By now, in the archives of many newspapers her name is
misspelled ``Kadiadou,'' because one of the first reporters she
talked to, she says, misheard her, and thought her name ended like
her son's. She liked that, the melding of Amadou's name with her
own.
 &HT;    Her father, she says, was unusual, insisting on the importance
of education not just for his sons but also for his daughters,
perhaps owing to his having an outspoken wife. (''I inherited that
from my mom,'' Kadi told me.
 &HT;    Even as a girl she was a beauty; when she was 14, a trader from
a nearby village asked her father for her hand in marriage.
 &HT;    Her father said he couldn't answer for Kadi: ``Go and talk to my
daughter first,'' he told Saikou Diallo, 30, a man who already had
a wife and two children. ``I don't want to give you any hope before
you do.'' Kadi was unsure but willing; she is proud now that her
father insisted that as a condition of marriage she be allowed to
continue her education.
 &HT;    Amadou, the first of their four children, was born two years
later, when she was 16. ``I was very young, and I thought I was too
young to keep him,'' she told Newsday. ``At night, I woke up to see
if he was there.''
 &HT;    As a boy, Amadou developed a lisp. His mispronunciation of her
name became a treasured nickname. ``Tatatou,'' he called her.
 &HT;    By then the family was living in neighboring Liberia, where
Saikou had a trading business. After a coup in 1980, they returned
to Guinea to escape the instability.
 &HT;    But Saikou found that the socialism of President Sokou Touro
made life hard for a businessman; he took his family to Togo. They
returned to Guinea in 1984 when the president died, and before long
moved to Thailand.
 &HT;    Saikou had mainly been trading in gold and gems and, Kadi says,
had a large store of low-quality Guinean rubies. A company in
Thailand told him they had a heat treatment for the gems that could
increase their quality. But Saikou ended up losing a lot of money
and wanted to move to Singapore.
 &HT;    Tired of constantly moving the family, Kadi refused to go and
Saikou threatened to leave. ``Maybe he was thinking I would come
back,'' she said. ``Divorce is like a threat to the woman, to have
more control _ because only a small number of women can survive
alone. Women are very disadvantaged in Africa.''
 &HT;    But she would not be dissuaded, and the marriage ended. ``I was
determined to support myself and live on my own.''
 &HT;    Having learned her husband's business, she began to trade gems
in Bangkok. Before long she moved her four children back to
Conakry, the capital of Guinea. Through connections in the mining
industry she ended up the highly paid representative of an
Australian company interested in opening a gold mine. She went to
the office every day, helping to arrange the needed permits and
permissions.
 &HT;    Amadou, who had earned a degree in computer science from a
college in Bangkok, left on a tourist visa for the United States in
September 1996.
 &HT;    ``He told me he wanted to realize his dream'' of working in
computers or electronics, his mother, Kadi Diallo said, ``because
he had seen me struggle to bring the children up and wanted to help
me. His plan was to come back and assume his place as head of the
family.''
 &HT;    But all of that would dissolve into grief.
 &HT;    For Americans, the sight of Kadiatou Diallo stepping from a
police van last February in front of 1157 Wheeler Avenue in the
Bronx, seeing the place where police officers had killed her
unarmed son and helplessly crying, ``Amadou, Amadou,'' until she
collapsed in the arms of other West African Muslim women in
traditional robes, was a haunting spectacle, replayed endlessly on
television.
 &HT;    Her grief attached poignancy to what until that moment had
simply horrified: the unbelievable fusillade of bullets mistakenly
aimed at this particular dark-skinned man.
 &HT;    It let the world know that this victim was beloved, would be
missed.
 &HT;    At one point she told me of a sympathizer who had said to her,
``I'm very sorry for your son _ he was just in the wrong place at
the wrong time.''
 &HT;    ``No!'' she had responded sharply. ``He was in the right
place!'' Amadou, I had heard his uncle assert in the same vein,
``loved America more than most Americans.''
 &HT;    And she graphically recalled the terrible phone call from New
York when it was barely light on the morning of Feb. 4. On the
other end of the line was Abdul Karim, Amadou's cousin.
 &HT;    ``They didn't tell me how many bullets, because all the family
wanted to protect me from the shock. But little by little I found
out. Our Australian investor came in the evening, and he said, 'I'm
sorry, but they shot him many times.' And I screamed, 'Why didn't
you tell me?' Because the bullets and everything, they tried to
minimize. 'I'm sorry,' he said, 'but they shot him many times,
Kadi, too many times.' And I told him: 'You must tell me. How
many?'
 &HT;    ``He said, 'It's 41 bullets.'''

FILMMAKER MORRIS SPEAKS IN THE `FIRST PERSON' FOR BRAVO
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 1/2 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Filmmaker Errol Morris has a neat little knack for rooting out
utterly bizarre subject matter and fascinatingly quirky individuals
to populate his documentaries. Tonight, on his new Bravo TV series
``First Person,'' he makes it a weekly, rather than semi-annual,
habit.
</P>
<P>
   Morris is famous for getting his interviewees to expose more of
themselves than they may have bargained for, largely through
keeping silent when they've finished their thought. If they resume
jabbering at that point, watch out _ they may reveal something they
shouldn't have. Using this method, Morris unraveled the mystery of
a cop killing in his classic film ``The Thin Blue Line'' and helped
rescue an innocent man on Death Row.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, death seems to be the overriding theme in ``First
Person,'' if the first three episodes are anything to go on. Each
episode, likewise, burrows into the cerebral cortex of increasingly
strange individuals _ watching each episode in sequence, I sat,
incredulous, as the stories got exponentially weirder. If this
procession continues in similar fashion, the last episode of the
series might just trump the shocking spectacle of ``Who Wants to
Marry a Multi-Millionaire?'' (In a good way, that is.)
</P>
<P>
   Tonight seems mild only by comparison, but is a fascinating
profile of Temple Grandin, a woman who was diagnosed with autism
but overcame her affliction, and in fact, put some of its symptoms
to good use _ to design ``humane'' slaughterhouses. She's a little
reminiscent of the subject of Morris' latest film, ``Mr. Death,''
who was a successful designer of Death Row regalia _ except that
Grandin didn't throw in with neo-Nazis. She calls one design _ in
which cattle are calmly lured onto a ramp leading to their demise _
her ``Stairway to Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week, in an episode titled ``I Dismember Mama,'' Morris
interviews Saul Kent, a guy who helped start a cryogenic company,
and subsequently enlisted his mother as a client. After she died,
he decapitated her and put her skull on ice in the hopes of
resuscitating her brain at some indeterminate time in the future.
His theories of longevity and life-expectancy might make your own
blood run cold.
</P>
<P>
   With luck, you'll have picked your jaw up off the ground in time
for the third installment, ``The Killer Inside Me,'' in which
Sondra London, a serial-killer groupie, reveals more about herself
than you might want to know. Her recitation of her current
infatuation's crimes is shockingly dispassionate to the point of
being comic. When both she and her current beau _ younger and
better looking than her previous mass-murderer, she notes _
serenade one another (he, during a court appearance _ there's a
great shot of the court stenographer typing out his crooning),
you'll need to go retrieve your jaw once again.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, glimpses of oddball archival footage and swirling
music from the late Caleb Sampson are spun into the mix, combining
with the tunneling into these unique minds to create a mesmerizing
effect. Think of Morris as a highbrow Jerry Springer, mining human
oddities for fun and profit, but also shining a light into some of
America's darker recesses. &QL;

quixotic personalities. &QL;

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After wasting millions of dollars and bloodying
each other's noses over religion, reform and who's the real Reagan
Republican, John McCain and George W. Bush are blowing off Ronald
Reagan's home state.
</P>
<P>
   Following months of public appearances and debates in the weird
and puny states of New Hampshire and South Carolina, the Republican
candidates for president are giving California a week of
trickle-down campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three months, Bush has spent all of one day in
California. McCain has spent more time here (the Arizona senator
always says, ``I like to visit my water''), and will take his bus
tour through the Central Valley this week. But he backed out of the
one statewide televised debate.
</P>
<P>
   The polls say McCain can't carry California Republicans on March
7, but he's close in New York. Thus, we'll be hearing a lot about
New York issues like _ what? _ Hillary Rodham Clinton, Rudolph
Giuliani and the right of policemen to empty their handguns when
threatened by black people brandishing loaded wallets.
</P>
<P>
   California may be more representative of new American realities
than New York, but who says this Republican primary is about
reality?
</P>
<P>
   This is a race in which Bush thought he could make a big
symbolic statement to South Carolina fundamentalists by speaking at
the racist, anti-Catholic Bob Jones University, and yet he thought
that wouldn't make a big symbolic statement elsewhere in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bush took 24 days to admit he made a mistake. If he runs
the country the way he does his campaign, don't expect high
intelligence or quick decisions on anything.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McCain is pounding Bush for his links to right-wing
fundamentalists, which ought to play well in New York and much of
California. But what was McCain thinking when he tried to say he
only uses the word ``gook'' about his North Vietnamese captors and
not Asians in general?
</P>
<P>
   It's reminiscent of racist Southerners who used to say that only
certain African-Americans deserved to be called by the N-word.
Sorry, it doesn't cut it, and neither do any of McCain's excuses
about skipping the California debate.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe McCain is tired and didn't want to risk using the word
``gook'' in California. I was on the East Coast when he said the
word. It raised a fuss in the San Francisco press, but received no
mention at all in the Boston or New York papers.
</P>
<P>
   There's always been a strong East Coast bias in the national
media, but I didn't know it extended to a blackout when candidates
slur major ethnic groups _ even if those groups are more strongly
represented in the West.
</P>
<P>
   We need to see these guys in action, not just in their stump
speeches and rehearsed town meetings.
</P>
<P>
   McCain made a big mistake canceling the debate. A lot of us
really wanted to see if he's as much of a hothead as he seems, or
if Bush is as inarticulate as he sounds in sound bites, which get
caught in his throat so badly they call for sound Heimlichs.
</P>
<P>
   Last week he tied his tongue in knots about the Bob Jones
University disaster, accidentally saying he was against interracial
dating, when he meant he was against the college's ban on
interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
   When he tried to say the word ``bigotry'' it came out
``bigocy.'' As in big idiocy.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing the pattern of self-destruction it established with
the Clinton impeachment obsession, the Republican Party
establishment still backs George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   If the guy were a stock, they would have unloaded him weeks ago.
They invested $70 million in Boy George, whose resume would fit on
a post-it note, and he's already spent most of the money losing New
Hampshire and winning a Pyrrhic victory in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   McCain irritates the GOP establishment, so it undercuts him
every chance it gets, even though he's the one guy who can beat Al
Gore in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   So the question for Democrats, including those of us who
re-registered as Republicans for the California primary, is how do
we help the Republican Party destroy itself?
</P>
<P>
   Why not be a little vengeful and cast a negative vote? After
all, Republicans in Congress wasted years of our time trying to
destroy a popular Democratic president.
</P>
<P>
   When I registered as a Republican a few weeks ago, my idea was
to vote against the party-anointed nonentity who spoke at a bigoted
college and still thought he could be president.
</P>
<P>
   McCain isn't all that different in his conservative philosophy
than Bush. They believe that women have no right to abortion, that
gays are second-class citizens and that trillions should be spent
on hare-brained schemes to shoot rockets out of the sky. The idea
was just to vote against Bush, not for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed. Now it looks like I'll have to vote for Boy
George. He has one clear advantage over McCain. Gore can beat him
like a set of bongos.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe my wife and I will just cancel out each other's votes.
Being a Republican is hard work, almost as hard as being a Democrat
was in 1972, when the idea was to lose big with another George,
that McGovern guy.

EUROPE DISMISSES HAIDER RESIGNATION AS TACTICAL MANEUVER  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ European governments on Tuesday dismissed the abrupt
resignation of Joerg Haider from the leadership of his
anti-immigrant Freedom Party as a tactical maneuver and said
punitive measures against Austria would remain in place.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the British government said: ``Our concern over
what has been happening in Austria has been about policies not
personalities. The Freedom Party is still in government. It is
still extremist.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Guterres, the Portuguese prime minister and current
holder of the rotating presidency of the 15-member European Union,
said there would be no change in position ``for the moment''
because the key question ``is the nature of the Freedom Party.''
</P>
<P>
   The European stance appeared certain to maintain pressure on the
already strained coalition of Wolfgang Schuessel, the conservative
chancellor, who took his People's Party into government with the
Freedom Party three weeks ago and so ended three decades of Social
Democrat-led rule in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   In an unprecedented intrusion into the domestic politics of a
member state of the European Union, the 14 other governments froze
bilateral relations with Austria, determined that Austrian
ambassadors would only be received at the ``technical level,'' and
vowed not to support any Austrians for senior positions in
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Schuessel made clear that he viewed Haider's resignation as an
attempt to overcome international mistrust. Throughout Austria, an
initial feeling that the European measures would prove ephemeral
has given way to the grim understanding that they are likely to
last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe this is a game or a tactical maneuver, but a
serious offer to ease pressure on the government,'' Schuessel said.
``I take this offer very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that personal attacks against Haider and his family at
a demonstration in Vienna in mid-February must have been ``almost
physically painful for anyone that has any sensibility.''
</P>
<P>
   People close to Haider, including the deputy speaker of the
parliament, Thomas Prinzhorn, have also suggested that he has been
wounded by the extent and intensity of the attacks on him. Haider
appears to have believed that his apologies for isolated past
remarks praising aspects of the Third Reich would be broadly
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor, who obliged Haider to issue a formal statement
before the government was formed saying the revisionist comments
about the Nazis were a mistake, appeared largely isolated in his
view that the resignation should be taken as a serious invitation
to normalize ties with Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Only Italy, which has been irked by German suggestions that it
too may face European sanctions if a rightist party joins the
government, hinted that the resignation could open the way for a
reconsideration of the European position.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberto Dini, the Italian foreign minister, said that if the
Freedom Party turned its back on extremist positions it sometimes
adopted in the past, ``It will be possible to see if normal
relations can be reestablished with a country that is such a friend
of Italy.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy's far-right National Alliance, led by Gianfranco Fini,
briefly joined a government in the mid-1990s. There was no reaction
then from a European Union still consumed with its economic
integration through the creation of the euro rather than with its
political identity.
</P>
<P>
   Belgium, which has been virulent in its criticism of Austria and
even suggested the country might leave the European Union, showed
no sign of softening its tone. ``Nothing has changed,'' said Louis
Michel, the Belgian foreign minister. ``Joerg Haider obviously
remains in the party and this party will continue to listen to his
orders.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a statement issued Monday explaining his resignation, Haider
said that he wanted to concentrate on his job as governor of the
southern state of Carinthia and thought the six Freedom Party
ministers in the government should be freed of his shadow. But
asked whether he still has ambitions to be chancellor, he replied:
``I do not exclude it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander van Bellen, the leader of the opposition Green party,
said, ``The government is clearly a shadow cabinet, despite Mr.
Haider's resignation.'' Just how long the government will last has
become an open question in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   But angered by the European reaction, and convinced that the
ousted Social Democrats have played a central role in orchestrating
the outcry against Austria through fellow center-left parties in
government, both Schuessel and Haider have vowed that their
coalition would not bow to external pressure.
</P>
<P>
   One man who clearly could not take the pressure was the Freedom
Party's Michael Krueger, 44, who resigned as justice minister on
Tuesday after just over three weeks in office. He was said to be in
a hospital suffering from stress after a tenure marked chiefly by
his widely noted desire to have a Jaguar as his official car.
</P>
<P>
   The government faces some potentially unpopular decisions over
cutting Austria's budget deficit and ballooning debt, and it seemed
plausible that Haider's decision was rooted in a desire to avoid
direct criticism and so position himself to return as a kind of
national savior in the next elections.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact remained that the decision to resign must have been
painful to a man with a strong taste for power. It therefore
suggested that the personal and political pressure on him has been
close to overwhelming.

   Q: What's the story behind the name of the Watergate cake?
</P>
<P>
   _ E.S., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Watergate cake and Watergate salad got their names from the
scandal that caused President Nixon's resignation, but the
connection between politics and dessert isn't clear.
</P>
<P>
   Both recipes use pistachio instant pudding mix, which was
introduced by Kraft Foods in 1975. The original recipe for
Watergate salad was developed that year by Kraft to promote the new
product.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kraft named it Pistachio Pineapple Delight. ``The
company didn't refer to it at all as Watergate salad until
consumers started requesting a recipe for Watergate salad,''
according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch.
</P>
<P>
   Watergate Salad was reportedly named by a Chicago food editor
for an article, but neither the article nor editor has been tracked
down. The full name of the cake is Watergate cake with cover-up
icing.

   Q: Where can I write to the Old Jacksonville Ceiling Fan Co.?
</P>
<P>
   _ T.W., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Old Jacksonville fans were built by Nichols Cusan in
Jacksonville, Texas, but the company went out of business about 10
to 15 years ago, said Mike Evans, owner of Gulf Coast Fans near
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Gulf Coast repairs Old Jacksonville fans and sells replacement
parts. ``They don't make fans like that anymore,'' Evans said. ``If
something goes wrong, it's probably a flywheel _ the rubber part
that holds the blade.''
</P>
<P>
   The company sells a $49.20 replacement flywheel with phone
support for do-it-yourself repairs. For more information, call
(281) 495-6434 or visit the Web site www.eceilingfans.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to former Dallas Maverick Jim Jackson?
</P>
<P>
   _ B.C., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Jackson or any other Atlanta Hawks player in care of
the team at 1 CNN Center, Suite 405, South Tower, Atlanta 30303.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, 29, has played for five teams since Dallas traded him
in 1997: the New Jersey Nets, Philadelphia 76ers, Golden State
Warriors, Portland Trailblazers and Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   An off-season resident of Dallas, Jackson is a vice president of
the NBA Players Association.

INDIA, A NUCLEAR POWER, RAISES MILITARY SPENDING 28 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ With relations between India and Pakistan at
their worst point in three decades, India on Tuesday announced a
28.2 percent increase in military spending, the largest single-year
boost in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shall not shrink from making any sacrifice to guard and
protect every inch of our beloved motherland,'' the finance
minister, Yashwant Sinha, said in presenting the annual budget to
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes less than three weeks before President
Clinton is scheduled to arrive here on a mission that is at least
partly intended to ease the strain between two of the world's
nuclear powers.
</P>
<P>
   The big jump in military spending is no surprise. It has been
expected since India fought intense battles with Pakistani-backed
forces in Kashmir six months ago. The Indians drove off the
invaders, but the incursion revealed weaknesses in the nation's
defenses. The military complained that a decade of belt-tightening
had left it without needed funds for basic supplies, surveillance
equipment and upgraded weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, tensions have grown worse. Pakistan's military
overthrew the elected government in Islamabad. Guerrilla attacks
have increased in Kashmir. India blamed Pakistan for the hijacking
of an Indian airliner on Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   ``India is sending a message with the new budget,'' said George
Perkovich, author of the new book ``India's Nuclear Bomb.'' ``It's
saying to Pakistan, `OK, you may want to use a bellicose strategy
against us, but you're broke and we're not. We're going to spend 28
percent more. Can you match that?'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Pakistan is deeply in debt. But India, too, has a
ballooning fiscal deficit that needs attention. The budget for the
year beginning on April 1 calls for tax increases on higher-income
people, a review of state subsidies, and cuts in the government
payroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we are considering downsizing,'' Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee told reporters Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cuts in personnel will not include the military, which will have
an allowance of $13.5 billion. Nearly half the money will go to the
army. It is unclear how much will be devoted to nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really mind-boggling how a country could increase a
budget 28 percent if it was just for conventional forces,'' said
Maj. Gen. Rashid Qureshi, a spokesman for Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   In May of 1998, India tested a nuclear device and Pakistan
followed suit 17 days later. Ever since, there has been fear of an
arms race in South Asia.

   The rise in India's military budget is a victory for those who
have been wanting to beef up the armed forces. However, it is also
a repudiation of the view that nuclear weapons would buy a better
defense for less money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going nuclear hasn't done much for India's security, has it?''
said P.R. Chari, director of the Institute for Peace and Conflict
Studies in New Delhi. ``The country seems to be moving in several
directions all at once.''
</P>
<P>
   But others see a bigger military budget as an overdue payment.
``India has a 1-million-man army, a two-fleet navy and a
35-combat-squadron air force, and that takes money,'' said Uday
Bhaskar, deputy director of the Institute for Defense Studies and
Analyses here.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, when India was experiencing a financial crisis, the
military budget was cut back as a percentage of the gross domestic
product, Bhaskar said. The decline continued throughout the decade.
Last summer's fighting in Kashmir was a wake-up call.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that's happening now is that we're catching up,'' he said.

CHARDONNAY OF STEEL: CHABLIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Dining)  
 (af)  
 By ERIC ASIMOV   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any time you think you've got a grape figured out, along comes a
wine that knocks it out of its pigeonhole. The best chardonnays,
for example, whether from California or Burgundy or even Australia,
tend to be rich and creamy, full of exotic flavors buttressed by
sensations of toasty vanilla and butter that are induced by aging
in oak barrels.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Chablis, one of my favorite wines and an exception
to most other wines made from the chardonnay grape.
</P>
<P>
   Genuine Chablis, not to be confused with those jug wines tagged
with the name chablis, comes from the Chablis region of France
southeast of Paris. Chablis produces only white wines made from the
chardonnay grape, like the best white Burgundies.
</P>
<P>
   Though Chablis is generally lumped in with Burgundy, the region
is actually about 75 miles north of where most white Burgundies are
produced, which partly accounts for the singular nature of Chablis.
Because the vineyards are in a much cooler region, Chablis tends to
be crisp, lean and taut rather than fat and lush like so many other
chardonnays around the world.
</P>
<P>
   That crispness is partly a result of acidity. As grapes ripen,
the fruit's natural acids turn into sugar. Since grapes grown in
warmer areas have a longer growing season and thus tend to ripen
further than in cooler areas, they become sweeter and less acidic.
</P>
<P>
   When these grapes are harvested and fermented, that sugar
converts to alcohol, giving warm-weather grapes generally more
alcohol and less acid than cooler-weather grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Theess of Chablis is also a result of style. Most Chablis
is fermented in stainless steel tanks rather than oak barrels,
resulting in wines that reflect the characteristics of the fruit
and the vineyard, without added oak features.
</P>
<P>
   Even Chablis, though, has its exceptions. Rene and Vincent
Dauvissat, for example, are among the best Chablis makers, who use
oak carefully to augment the flavors of the grape. It's a rounder,
mellower style that still exhibits the steely mineral character of
Chablis.
</P>
<P>
   Chablis has four levels, depending on where the grapes are
grown. Grand cru is the best and most expensive, followed by
premier cru, Chablis and Petit Chablis. These six wines are listed
in order of preference. &QL;

YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS THE DANCE

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't know much about fortune cookies. However, I truly enjoy
cracking open those cute little delicacies that always accompany my
order of sesame chicken and an egg roll. Inside the cookie is a
small slip of paper containing a prediction or maxim.
</P>
<P>
   I always open the fortune cookie at the end of my meal. I wait
until I'm finished with my meal because that's what I've seen other
people do. In retrospect, I'm not sure that I should wait until
I've finished eating to read my fortune. Suppose it says, ``Avoid
egg rolls this week or you will have bad luck.'' That has never
happened but, just in case, I think I need to know about that
before my meal, don't you?
</P>
<P>
   I've been thinking a lot about the future lately. I've been
thinking about dreams, visions, and goals.
</P>
<P>
   Dreams are the seeds of hope.
</P>
<P>
   Dreams are merely images in the mind, something unreal. No one
else can see our dreams. That makes life difficult when we are
trying to make our dreams come true and it seems like no one else
supports us. Don't get angry because others don't embrace your
dream. If everyone could see it, it would be a vision, not a dream.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you do need help, and most of us do, you have to
take your dream and make it a vision, that is, an object of sight.
That's all a business plan or marketing plan or degree plan is,
actually. When you take something intangible and remote and make it
real and believable, your dream becomes a goal. Then, you will find
people willing to help you.
</P>
<P>
   I saw a psychic on television a few days ago. She seemed to have
an incredible ability to predict the future. For a moment, I
thought that would be a great ability to possess. However, some of
the best and hardest lessons of my life have come from the
unanticipated results of my choices. I might have made different
choices if I could predict the future, but I don't think I would
have become the person that I am without the thrill of victory and
agony of defeat that accompanied those choices.
</P>
<P>
   The worst times of my life have been the days and weeks when I
stopped dreaming. I lost my sense of purpose, my sense of hope. So,
no, I don't want to know the future; who's going to live or die,
who's going to betray me, or who will move away some day. What's
the fun in that?
</P>
<P>
   I think Garth Brooks said it best, ``I'm glad I didn't know the
way it all would end, the way it all would go. Our lives are better
left to chance. I could have missed the pain, but I'd have had to
miss the dance.''

THE TALENTED WRITER BEHIND `THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A current movie titled ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' is both a
critical and commercial success. Surprise: The film is adapted from
a novel titled ``The Talented Mr. Ripley.'' Surprise: The novel was
published 45 years ago. Surprise: Its author was born in Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The movie has prompted a renewal of interest in the late
Patricia Highsmith, several of whose works focused on the
diabolically charming Tom Ripley. Highsmith has long been regarded
as one of the best practitioners in her chosen genre. Suspense was
her racket. She did not write murder mysteries, because the murders
that occur (often) in her fiction are witnessed by the reader and
leave no doubt as to who did it. Her dark tales often take the
point of view of the evildoer.
</P>
<P>
   America's literary critics are reluctant to grant distinction to
authors who work the crime beat. Raymond Chandler and Dashiell
Hammett now are ennobled as masters of detective fiction, but with
no other companions in the pantheon. Europeans, however, are more
serious-minded about literary melodrama; and particularly in
France, Patricia Highsmith is considered a major American author.
</P>
<P>
   Because of her novels' worldwide popularity, Highsmith was
enabled to spend most of her adult life in the expensive serenity
of Locarno, Switzerland, where she died at age 74 in 1995. She was
writing to the end; and the posthumously published ``Small g: A
Summer Idyll,'' was her 22nd novel. Her short stories were
collected in several volumes, and a how-to nonfiction entry _
``Plotting and Writing Suspense Fiction'' _ was published in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Her first novel is the work with which Highsmith has been most
easily identified, again with some indebtedness to Hollywood. She
was 29 when ``Strangers on a Train'' was published. Movie rights
were purchased by the talented Mr. Alfred Hitchcock. In 1955, ``The
Talented Mr. Ripley'' became Highsmith's fourth published novel.
For years, it remained a favorite work for many readers and for the
author herself, so in late career she brought Tom Ripley back in
four sequels. If you've now seen the movie and are wondering what
happened later, be assured that yes, he got away with it.
</P>
<P>
   So is the movie like the book? Most of the book is in the movie,
but the movie adds important characters and events that are not in
Highsmith's original. In the novel, Tom Ripley and Dickie Greenleaf
actually were acquainted in their youth before Ripley's contrived
meeting with the latter in Italy. There's one less murder in the
novel. I'll say no more.

SO MUCH TASTE, SO LITTLE TIME

   (Dining)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The idea of preparing cassoulet in 40 minutes or less
is heresy, but I was determined to find a reasonable compromise
when I realized I would be unable to schedule the usual three-day
production to serve to friends before the weather turned warm.
</P>
<P>
   Authentic cassoulet from southern France contains beans, braised
mutton, sausage, confit of goose or duck and maybe a slab of bacon,
all stewed together so the flavors meld, and finished with a
crunchy topping of bread crumbs. It is glorified pork and beans,
but the glory is in the nuanced taste and richness. The depth of
flavor is impossible to replicate fast, so my goal was simply to
turn braised beans into a feast.
</P>
<P>
   I thought about starting with dried beans and simmering them
with thyme, garlic and fatty pork, but I wanted to take every
possible shortcut. So I used frozen white beans, which are now
being sold in some supermarkets, and combined them with tomatoes
and lots of garlic. If you can't find frozen beans, use canned, but
drain and rinse them first.
</P>
<P>
   Although the combination of beans, tomatoes and garlic is
already pretty potent, I figured that some flavorful cooking liquid
would help. I used red wine because it was handy. (I was going to
serve it with the stew.) Canned stock wouldn't add much flavor, but
if you go with dried beans, their cooking liquid would be
harmonious.
</P>
<P>
   In this cassoulet, there is no time for tenderizing tough meat
like mutton; you need instant flavor as well as tenderness. Pork
tenderloin, cut into chunks, meets both requirements: it tastes
good and it cooks quickly. Sausage, the sweet, fennel-scented kind,
is another fine addition, adding a little fat to the stew, which is
not only traditional but necessary. The sausage benefits from a
five-minute browning to crisp the skin and deepen the flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of duck confit, which my supermarket doesn't carry, I
used duck breast. I seared it on both sides until it was nice and
brown but still slightly rare, and I added its juices to the
simmering stew.
</P>
<P>
   If you have extra time to start with dried beans, you can cook
them with a few sprigs of fresh thyme, half a head of garlic and a
piece of salt pork or bacon. The garlic can be sauteed in a little
duck fat before you add the tomatoes and beans.
</P>
<P>
   You can also substitute browned duck confit for the duck breast;
add some of the confit's fat as well, if you have it. Or you can
just finish the dish by toasting some bread crumbs seasoned with
salt and pepper in the fat left over from browning the duck.
Sprinkle these on top of the stew just before serving.
</P>
<P>
   All my work was done on top of the stove, and quickly, but the
results surprised and delighted me. This rapid-strike version of
cassoulet was not as magnificent as those I've slaved over in the
past, but it was as delicious as most of those I have had in
restaurants. Though the amount of food here should serve eight, I
list the yield as four to six because it's one of those dishes you
can't stop eating. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STREAMLINED CASSOULET &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 40 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 cups chopped tomatoes, with their juice (canned are fine)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped garlic
</P>
<P>
   4 cups white beans, nearly fully cooked (drained if canned)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup stock, dry red wine, bean cooking liquid or water
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   [ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 pound Italian sausage, preferably in one piece
</P>
<P>
   1 pound pork tenderloin, cut into 1-inch cubes
</P>
<P>
   1 boned duck breast &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Combine tomatoes and garlic in a large saucepan, bring to a
boil and add beans. Bring to a boil again, stirring occasionally,
then reduce heat so mixture bubbles regularly but not furiously.
Cook about 20 minutes, adding stock or other liquid when mixture
thickens. Add salt and cayenne when beans are tender and flavorful.
</P>
<P>
   2. While beans are cooking, put sausage in a skillet, and turn
heat to medium-high; brown on both sides, turning only once or
twice. Add to pot with bean mixture, along with pork cubes. Raise
heat a bit if necessary to keep a simmer going. Stir beans
occasionally so pork cooks evenly.
</P>
<P>
   3. Cut a {-inch crosshatch in skin side of duck breast, right
down to fat layer. Put breast, skin side down, in skillet that
sausage cooked in, and turn heat to medium-high. Cook until nicely
browned, pouring any rendered duck fat and juices into bean
mixture. Turn duck, and brown meat side. Then crisp up skin side
again for a minute or so, once more pouring any fat into beans.
Total cooking time for breast will be 6 to 8 minutes. When it is
done, add breast to beans.
</P>
<P>
   4. To serve, carve sausage and duck breast into serving pieces,
and place on plates. Top with beans and pork.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 to 6 servings.

ENRICHING SALMON WITH A SIMPLE TECHNIQUE AND A GENTLE TOUCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (This is the first of eight columns by Christian Delouvrier, the
executive chef of Lespinasse in New York. They are being written
with Melissa Clark.)  
 (Dining)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Salmon confit with arugula is a luxurious dish _ so
luxurious that it is best in small portions. I love it as an
appetizer or, at the restaurant, as a small course on the tasting
menu.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many dishes that appeal to me, it relies on perfect,
simple ingredients and classical French technique _ which might
sound daunting for a home cook, but don't worry. This preparation
is very simple, but you'd never guess that tasting the result.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of making a confit out of fish came from my sous-chef,
Neil Annis. The fish cooks gently in hot oil, so the flesh doesn't
shrink or fall apart but instead takes on a silken richness. The
flavor intensifies, and even the color turns a deeper shade of
rose.
</P>
<P>
   In a classic confit, duck is cooked in its own rendered fat, but
I didn't think duck fat would work well with salmon. Salmon is an
oily fish; the added flavor of poultry fat would only be a
distraction. So instead, I decided to try olive oil, which is light
enough to let the true flavor of the salmon shine through. In the
finished dish, it is undetectable.
</P>
<P>
   In April and May, I like to use wild salmon from the Copper
River. It's a beautiful fish, with dark pink flesh that's a little
less fatty than other types of salmon. Other times of the year, I
use a farmed salmon from Scotland, which is also very good.
</P>
<P>
   To make the confit, we heat the oil on the stove, then place the
pan on a heated marble slab (it's really a plate warmer). That
keeps the oil at the right temperature, about 140 degrees, for the
whole night. At home, you can simply heat the oil in a heavy pan,
then take it off the heat; the fish will cook before the oil cools
down.
</P>
<P>
   Once I had the technique for cooking the salmon, the rest of the
dish was easy.
</P>
<P>
   I keep it very spare, using only four elements on the plate. I
place a rectangular chunk of the salmon on a little pile of baby
arugula, which is a bit sour and cuts through the fatty fish. I
never use a vinaigrette; the juices from the salmon coat the greens
and keep the flavors focused.
</P>
<P>
   But I do drizzle a 100-year-old balsamic vinegar around the edge
of the plate, and together with the salmon juices, it is
essentially a deconstructed dressing.
</P>
<P>
   I use a very good vinegar, so concentrated it's almost like a
syrup. It can be very, very expensive, as much as $130 a bottle. So
in this recipe, I give you a trick. By reducing regular balsamic
vinegar, you can create a thick liquid that imitates the texture
and sweet flavor of the aged vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another ingredient that simply can't be skimped on:
the coarse sea salt I sprinkle on top of the salmon. I use sel de
Guerande, a moist, gray salt from France. It's not difficult to
find (even some supermarkets have it) and it's not terribly costly,
about $2 for a nine-ounce canister. Sel de Guerande is unlike any
other salt; it retains some of the mineral flavors of the sea and
has an almost foamy sort of crunch.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, the sea salt is what brings the dish to life. &QL;

CHINA HAS NOT CHANGED POLICY ON TAIWAN, SAYS BEIJING OFFICIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A new Chinese policy paper on Taiwan, which has
prompted a furious reaction in the United States, merely
``reiterates the government's consistent stance'' and does not
represent a change in policy, a senior Chinese official said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some foreign media have regarded China as making a major
change to its policy on solving the Taiwan issue,'' state
television quoted Deputy Prime Minister Qian Qichen as saying on
Tuesday evening. ``This view is incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   A ``white paper'' issued last week by the State Council, China's
cabinet, declared that China would be forced to take ``all drastic
measures,'' including military force, under three conditions: if
Taiwan declared independence, if it was invaded by foreign troops,
or if Taiwan's government refused ``indefinitely'' to make progress
on the reunification of Taiwan with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Although the third condition had long been implicit in China's
policy toward Taiwan, which Beijing views as a breakaway province,
it had never been so explicitly stated.
</P>
<P>
   With Taiwan's presidential election just a few weeks away, the
stark inclusion of this third condition in the document was
interpreted in Taiwan and by many Western politicians as a new
direct military threat.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, members of both the administration and Congress
were caught off-guard by the policy paper, and many reacted swiftly
and harshly to the new clause.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. foreign policy analysts said that the potential for a
crisis in the Taiwan Straits was now ``very high.'' Lawmakers said
they would now consider arms sales to Taiwan with a new urgency,
and a congressional vote that is needed to help usher China into
the World Trade Organization suddenly seemed in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   But China's leaders seemed equally taken by surprised at the
passion of the U.S. response. In the past week, Chinese officials
have said in private that the ultimatums in the paper were not new
and were, in fact, intended to encourage a peaceful settlement to
the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
   And ordinary Chinese paid the policy paper little heed. A number
noted that it set no deadline for talks on reunification.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they said they might use force _ they have to say
this _ but it doesn't mean they will,'' said a industrial relations
major at People's University in Beijing, who gave only his surname,
Zhang. ``They're just trying to influence Taiwan's elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper's warning against delaying reunification talks is, at
least, a sign of China's growing impatience with Taiwan, which has
so far been far more interested in negotiating business ties than
reunification.
</P>
<P>
   In recent speeches, President Jiang Zemin and other Chinese
leaders have repeatedly said that reunification with Taiwan is a
top priority, now that Hong Kong and Macau have both been absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite such statements, the mood in China is more
relaxed than in 1996, in the weeks before Taiwan's last
presidential election, when China lobbed missiles near Taiwan. U.S.
warships steamed into the region in a show of support.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, this week, the head of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, Adm.
Dennis Blair, was in Beijing for a previously scheduled visit with
Defense Minister Chi Haotian and top Chinese military officials.
</P>
<P>
   While Chi told Blair that China would ``never commit not to use
force,'' the New China News Agency reported, he also stressed that
Beijing was ``committed to peaceful reunification with Taiwan.''

 &HT;    IRS SCORED FOR FAILING TO PURSUE TAX CHEATERS
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Internal Revenue Service came under fire on
Capitol Hill Tuesday for letting tax cheaters off the hook and for
hiring people charged with crimes as temporary workers.
</P>
<P>
   Government Reform subcommittee chairman Steve Horn, R-Calif.,
said the agency operations ``have placed an unacceptable burden on
taxpayers and equally unacceptable loss of revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Fred Thompson
said that ``once again we see that the IRS can't keep its own books
while demanding that taxpayers keep theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials appeared before Horn's subcommittee to
respond to a sharply critical audit of the tax-collecting agency
issued by the U.S. General Accounting Office, the investigative arm
of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS's acting chief financial officer, Lawrence W. Rogers,
blamed many of the accounting problems on the agency's ``archaic''
computer system, which is to be replaced over the next several
years.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO focused much of its criticism on the tax agency's
failure to pursue tax scofflaws. Among the examples:
</P>
<P>
   _ A doctor who owed $100,000 in taxes going back to the 1980s
had an income of $200,000 as of 1998, and yet he was ``not being
actively pursued,'' said GAO official Gregory D. Kutz.
</P>
<P>
   _ Employers reneged on $43 billion in Social Security and
Medicare payroll taxes and late penalties over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   _ The IRS reports $231 billion in unpaid tax assessments, but
collection efforts are so unsuccessful that more than half,
totalling $127 billion, have been written off.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS acknowledged that in 1999 it hired nearly 5,000 people
to handle checks and tax returns before their criminal background
clearances were complete.
</P>
<P>
   Of those new employees, 138 were later found to have unsuitable
backgrounds, including criminal charges for theft and weapons
violations. At least 65 were either fired or forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
   IRS chief operations officer John M. Dalrymple told the
lawmakers the rushed hirings were necessary at peak times ``when we
have tremendous amounts of mail coming in'' around April 15 tax
filing day.
</P>
<P>
   Although he said the FBI can provide criminal background checks
within eight days, ``we can't completely commit'' to waiting that
long.

   SCOTUS (Washington) _ Two lively Supreme Court arguments on
police practices found the government on the defensive Tuesday, as
the justices suggested that the police may have violated the
Constitution by frisking a Miami teen-ager on the basis of an
anonymous tip that he was carrying a gun and by squeezing a bus
passenger's soft-sided luggage to see if it contained drugs. The
court appeared surprisingly unimpressed by the government's
arguments, in one case that guns are so inherently dangerous that
the police are justified in acting on the basis of a bare-bones tip
that might otherwise be insufficient, and in the other case that
passengers relinquish any expectation of privacy in their luggage
once they toss it into an overhead bin where it can be pushed and
shoved by others seeking room for their own bags. By Linda

AVOCADO SKIPS THE APPETIZERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Dining)  
 (af)  
 By STEVEN RAICHLEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Guacamole may be the dip of summer, but avocados are at their
prime right now. This tropical fruit, with its soft, pale flesh,
can go a long way in adding interest to a winter diet. Green
vegetables often disappoint at this time of year, but the avocado
brings a blast of summery freshness.
</P>
<P>
   Botanically speaking, the avocado is a fruit, and in some parts
of the world _ notably Southeast Asia and Brazil _ it is' treated
as such. Brazilians, for example, combine the flesh with sugar to
make desserts. The Vietnamese whirl it with sweetened condensed
milk and ice in a blender to make milkshakes.
</P>
<P>
   But in most places, including the United States, the avocado is
treated as a vegetable. It is mashed into dips, pureed in soups and
diced over fajitas, and its pale green slices are fanned over
salads. But the avocado can play more central roles, a virtue
appreciated by the Mexicans, who inherited their taste for it from
the Aztecs, and who seldom eat a meal without it.
</P>
<P>
   The fruit may have been considered an aphrodisiac in years past,
but today it is prized for its softly firm flesh, its sweet
herbaceous flavor and a buttery richness that is' unique in the
world of plants.
</P>
<P>
   This richness comes from the avocado's high fat content _ a
hefty 20 percent. Avocados are so rich in cholesterol-free
vegetable fat they've been called poor man's butter (I prefer the
notion of vegetable foie gras).
</P>
<P>
   You have surely recognized this quality if you have ever spooned
guacamole over dry grilled meats in taquitos or carnitas. Perhaps
this was the inspiration for a silken avocado sauce I enjoyed in
Mexico City, where it was served with simply grilled fish.
</P>
<P>
   There are two main commercial varieties of avocados: a large,
shiny green variety called alligator pear, which is grown in
Florida, and the Haas, from California. The Haas is the more
familiar type, with wrinkled leathery black-green skin, pale
yellow-green flesh and an oval pit in the center. For both, the way
to check for ripeness is to gently squeeze the fruit between thumb
and forefinger: when ripe, it will gently yield.
</P>
<P>
   Avocados ripen well at home. Store them, unwrapped, at room
temperature. You may want to buy them a few days before you plan to
use them to allow for ripening. Or buy fresh avocados every few
days, so you will always have a ripe one on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Many recipes call for diced or sliced avocados. There are two
easy ways to cut them. For avocado slices, using the tip of your
knife, make four shallow lengthwise slits in the skin from end to
end. Pinching one corner of the skin between the knife blade and
your thumb, gently pull it away from the avocado, almost as you
would peel a banana. Repeat to remove all four sections of the
skin. Then cut the flesh off the pit in lengthwise wedges.
</P>
<P>
   To dice avocado, first cut the fruit in half lengthwise with a
single cut to the pit, rotating the fruit 360 degrees while
cutting. Twist the halves in opposite directions; the pit will
separate from one half. Sink the blade into the pit and gently
rotate the knife; the pit will pop out of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Using the tip of the knife, make a series of parallel cuts
through the avocado flesh but not through the skin. They should be
half an inch apart. Now, make another series of cuts at a 90 degree
angle to the first. Use a spoon to scrape the avocado out of the
skin. The flesh will come out in neat dice.
</P>
<P>
   Avocado discolors quickly, so squeeze fresh lime or lemon juice
over the flesh to keep it from browning.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes here are a soulful avocado chicken soup inspired by
the tart, tangy lime soup of the Yucatan; an avocado and white bean
salad that would be at home in Tuscany; and a broiled salmon with
avocado sauce fragrant with roasted chilies.
</P>
<P>
   Let March winds howl: the taste of summer is only an avocado
away. &QL;

 &HT;    'GRANNY D' ENDS THE WALK, BUT NOT THE TALK
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After walking the walk for 3,200 miles and more
than a year, talking the talk on campaign finance reform came
easily on Tuesday for 90-year-old Doris Haddock _ ``Granny D'' to
her legions of followers.
</P>

   ``The time has come for reform or for some new senators,'' she
warned, standing on the U.S. Capitol steps and speaking in a strong
New England accent and wearing a broad-brimmed straw hat.

<P>
   A bipartisan majority in the House has passed a bill to ban
so-called ``soft money'' in political campaigns but the measure has
been blocked in the Senate.

   Haddock, a lifelong political activist from Dublin, N.H., began
her long protest march about 14 months ago at the 1999 Rose Bowl
Parade in Pasadena, Calif. She was hospitalized from dehydration in
the Mojave desert, saw the bluebonnets bloom last spring in Texas,
and trudged through Pennsylvania snow this winter. She walked 10
miles a day, 1400 steps to a mile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doris Haddock has given us her 90th year and then some,'' said
Ronnie Dugger, head of the Alliance for Democracy, which advocates
public funding of elections. ``She has walked into our hearts and
walked into history.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, was among the members of Congress
who welcomed ``Granny D'' by walking with her on the final steps of
her journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Washington, as Granny D walked across America, special
interests with unlimited secret funds continued to walk all over
Americans on one critical issue after another,'' said Doggett. ``We
can never give up on meaningful reform because nothing less than
the future of our democracy is at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   A widow and great-grandmother of 12, Haddock said she began her
walk after hearing Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other opponents
of campaign finance reform say that people don't care about the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have come to tell them that they are wildly mistaken,'' she
told hundreds of cheering supporters, including David Crosby, the
singer. The crowd took up the chant when Rep. Connie Morella,
R-Md., urged, ``As the Beach Boys said, 'Go Granny Go'.''
</P>
<P>
   Haddock described walking beside the rows on white crosses at
Arlington National Cemetery and thinking that those fallen soldiers
did not give their lives ``so laws might be sold to the highest
bidder.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans she met along the way gave her a message to bring
to Washington, she said: ``We come a'sweeping.''

SHARON ARGUES AGAINST AID TO SYRIA AS PART OF ANY PEACE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Presuming that Israeli-Syrian peace talks will
resume because President Clinton ``will make every effort to see
that it happens,'' Ariel Sharon, leader of the opposition Likud
Party, began campaigning Tuesday against Western aid to Syria as
part of any deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to sound the alarm before it's too late,'' Sharon, a
right-wing former general, said in an interview. ``Once and if and
when this process will start, the time will be short. And I really
worry that Syria will get the financial means to purchase modern
weapons and threaten the qualitative edge that Israel must
maintain.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been widely rumored in Israel and in Washington that
Israel and Syria will soon return to the negotiations that were
suspended in January. In Jordan, Arab diplomats said Tuesday that
talks would resume in March, and that an announcement would be made
in the next 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   But Israeli and U.S. officials deny that there has been any
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no indication whatsoever about the possibility of
resuming talks,'' said Gadi Baltiansky, spokesman for Prime
Minister Ehud Barak. ``The Americans are trying to revive them, but
so far there is no movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Barak has publicly signaled his readiness by hinting
earlier this week that he would consider a complete withdrawal from
the Golan Heights _ a hint that Syria welcomed but demanded in
writing.
</P>
<P>
   And the Israeli opposition, sensing that a return to the talks
is imminent, is gearing up for battle.
</P>
<P>
   A Likud member, Silvan Shalom, is trying to build support among
conservative members of Barak's coalition government for a bill
that would require a majority of all eligible voters, not just
those who go to the polls, to approve a withdrawal. The bill is
thought to be an attempt to dilute the role of the many Israeli
Arab voters and to command a ``Jewish majority.''
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary vote on the bill is expected Wednesday, with
members of three parties in the coalition _ the Russian immigrants,
the National Religious Party and the ultra-Orthodox Shas _ voting
against the government.
</P>
<P>
   And Sharon, who rarely speaks to foreign reporters based here,
took the uncommon step Tuesday of issuing a press release and
summoning an American reporter to his office at Parliament. He said
he had been driven to do so by news that liberal American lobbying
groups were trying to persuade members of Congress ``to overcome
their natural resistance'' to provide Syria money as part of a
peace package.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think they're going to do?''' he asked. ``Spend it
on education?''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon singled out the Israel Policy Forum, a pro-peace group
that advocates an active U.S. role in the peace effort. He said the
group is ``creating a dangerous situation'' by stepping up its
lobbying efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Smerling, director of the Israel Policy Forum's
Washington center, said that when peace negotiations get serious,
opponents often try to undermine the U.S. role to ``pull the plug
on the whole enterprise.'' He said his group doesn't lobby for aid
to Syria, but encourages Congress to see the strategic value of
peace with Syria and ``not to foreclose any options before a deal
is struck.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Opponents of peace have long viewed Congress as the soft
underbelly of Israel's peace initiative,'' Smerling said, adding
that anti-peace groups are playing to Congress members' budget
anxieties by highlighting the high cost of a peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   It is considered unlikely that Congress would ever provide Syria
with much financial assistance. If negotiations resume restarted
and an agreement reached, it is more likely that European and Arab
nations would provide the bulk of aid to Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon said that investment in Syria would be a better way to
support the country and bring into the world economy. ``Just don't
give them cash,'' he said. ``We know what they will buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposed to conceding the Golan Heights at all, Sharon warned
that Israel would be pressured to ``give it away'' by the offer of
``smart weapons.'' Technology itself, he said, cannot replace
conventional weapons and the strategic depth that Israel would lose
by giving away the Golan Heights and especially Mount Hermon. Also,
Israel cannot afford some of the weaponry being discussed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It would be another ``huge mistake,'' Sharon said, if Americans
stationed troops on Mount Hermon as part of an agreement. The first
casualties of U.S. soldiers would be ``disastrous'' for
Israeli-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he felt confident that the negotiations would resume
and that these issues would be relevant, Sharon said, ``I see the
effort of Mr. Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt the president is a friend of the Jews,'' he said.
``But one must remember that American presidents come and American
presidents go and Israel has to survive forever.''

   &UR; Touring Jewish Budapest &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Four of us will be in Budapest for three days this summer. We
would like to hire an English-speaking guide to learn about the
city's Jewish history and culture. _ Maxine Greenberg, South
Windsor, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   A. Jews were a strong presence in Budapest as early as the 13th
century, and a large Jewish community was part of Hungarian society
until the Holocaust. Among the sites you'll probably want to visit
are the great Dohany Street Synagogue in central Pest _ among the
largest in the world, seating 3,000 _ and its museum and Holocaust
Memorial, a sculpture of a weeping willow.
</P>
<P>
   The Hungarian National Tourist Office, can provide a list of
English-speaking guides in Budapest, according to Nicole Rona,
assistant to the director. It also has a free brochure, ``Shalom:
Jewish Relics in Hungary,'' to help with your explorations of
Erzsbet Town, the old Jewish quarter. Contact the office at 150
East 58th St., New York, N.Y. 10155; (212) 355-0240, fax (212)
207-4103; or see www.gotohungary.com,
</P>
<P>
   Among the travel agencies in Budapest that can arrange Jewish
cultural tours is Cityrama Sightseeing Travel Agency, Bathori Utca
22, 1054 Budapest; (36-1) 331-0305, fax (36-1) 312-5424. It offers
a walking tour at 10 a.m. on Sunday, Monday, Wednesday and Friday
after April 1. Besides the Dohany Street Synagogue, it goes to
three other synagogues and, from May till October, the Raoul
Wallenberg Memorial and a medieval synagogue, among other places.
Requests to visit particular sites are welcome, Emese Dombovari of
Cityrama said.
</P>
<P>
   This tour lasts three hours and includes a lunch stop at a
kosher restaurant, with free cake and beverage. The cost is about
$16, at 260 forints to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Dombovari said that City-rama, which also has offices in Vienna
and Prague, arranges private tours in minibuses for $26.50 an hour,
with a minimum of three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Another similar walking tour is offered twice daily except
Saturdays and holidays from mid-March through October by Expo
Travel, Rozsa Utca 71, 1064 Budapest, (36-1) 311-9050, fax (36-1)
353-1515. It lasts two and a half hours, costs $20 and stops at a
nonkosher restaurant. Private tours by car in Buda and Pest cost
$100 a day.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Around and About Garda &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have rented an apartment in Lazise, Italy, on Lake Garda,
as a base to explore the area, including Venice, on day trips.
Should I take trains or use my rental car? _ Peter Iserloth, Fair
Haven, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A. Lazise, on the southeast shore of Lake Garda, is perfectly
situated for visiting other cities in the area, like Brescia,
Verona and Venice. Though small, Lazise has a few notable
monuments, including a 12th-century castle with five towers and the
Romanesque church of San Nicolo with its 12th-century frescoes. For
centuries, the Dogana Veneta, or Venetian customs house, at the
town's small port was the point from which the Venetian Republic
controlled commerce on the lake. The town still preserves large
sections of ivy covered medieval walls.
</P>
<P>
   There is no need to travel by car to reach interesting cities in
Lombardy and the Veneto, where finding parking is problematic and
can be expensive. In Venice, for example, one has to park at the
Piazzale Roma, where theGarage San Marco can cost as much as $24
for any period up to 24 hours, depending on the type of car.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably easier to drive to Peschiera del Garda, the
nearest train station, five to six miles from Lazise. From
Pescheria, there are dozens of trains to various cities.
</P>
<P>
   Trains leave for Venice, about a 1-hour 45-minute trip, at 8:13
a.m., 8:50 a.m., 10:13 a.m., 12:50 p.m., 1:13 p.m. and 2:15 p.m.;
the fare is $10.30, or $17 in first class. These all stop in Verona
and many stop in Vicenza and Padua. Going west, Brescia is a
half-hour trip ($4.50 or $7.25), and there are a couple of trains
every hour. Many continue to Milan.
</P>
<P>
   Buses go to many of the cities on Lake Garda as well as Verona
and Brescia, though buses from Peschiera are more frequent. A bus
from Brescia to Verona stops at the Esso station near the Peschiera
train station. Another goes toward Verona, stopping in Castelnuovo
del Garda, home of Gardaland, a large amusement park. Information:
SAIA Bus in Brescia, (39-030) 223-761.
</P>
<P>
   Another line stops in Lazise and goes up to Riva del Garda, the
northernmost city on the lake (about $4). Information: the APT in
Verona, (39-045) 800-4129.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Disabled in Monument Valley  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have you any information regarding tours of Monument Valley
for the disabled? _ Daniel Jackson, Houston
</P>
<P>
   A. Monument Valley, whose rock formations are famous as the
backdrop of many western movies, lies in a Navajo tribal park. All
guides in the park are Navajos and all tour operators must be
licensed by the tribe, according to Ronnie Biard of Goulding's
Lodge, which the Utah Travel Council says is the biggest of the
operators. The tribe requires that anyone heading into the back
country hire a Navajo guide, to protect sacred ceremonial areas
from visitors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Biard and the county tourism office said that they knew of no
tour vehicles with lifts for wheelchairs among the roughly 15
licensed companies. But both Biard and Martha Bennett of Bennett
Tours, a Navajo company, said they would be happy to do whatever a
disabled person is comfortable with to tour the area _ for example,
having guides lift them into the open-air trucks they use for most
tours, or using enclosed four-wheel-drive vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Except in bad weather, most private cars can manage the 17-mile
loop in the valley, Biard said, though he added that it was a
rough, unpaved road.
</P>
<P>
   You can request a list of licensed operators and information on
accessibilty in the area from the San Juan County Visitors
Services, Post Office Box 490, 117 South Main St., Monticello, Utah
84535; (800) 574-4386, fax (435) 587-2425.
</P>
<P>
   Goulding's Lodge, Post Office Box 360001, Monument Valley, Utah
84536, (435) 727-3231, fax (435) 727-3344, offers an eight-hour
tour, with a picnic lunch, for $60, $45 for ages 8 and under, and
three-hour excursions for $30 and $18. Four of the lodge's 62 rooms
are wheelchair accessible, Biard said; rates are $60 to $128.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett Tours, Post Office Box 360285, Monument Valley, Utah
84536, (800) 862-8270, fax (435) 727-3334, offers several
excursions, from an hour ($15) to all day ($80) with a steak or
Navajo taco lunch at Rain God Mesa.

&HT;        CELLUCCI CALLS FOR FEDERAL ANSWER TO OIL SHORTAGES
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Alex Canizares  
 &HT;    c. 2000 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Feb. 29 - Massachusetts Governor Paul Cellucci,
joined by other New England governors concerned about the region's
heating oil crisis, urged a US energy official to devise a federal
answer to prevent against supply shortages.
</P>
<P>
   At a National Governors' Association conference in the nation's
capital this week, Cellucci said while New England's economy is
booming, low supplies of oil have put the region in a ``dangerous
situation,'' with prices soaring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is that because we can't completely control price,
that means we can't completely control supply,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he supported creating a private, regional reserve in the
Northeast to avoid shortages. Sen. Edward Kennedy unveiled such a
plan last week.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of Energy T. J. Glauthier told the governors
the department was considering its options, including a plan to
temporarily draw oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, to be
returned later.
</P>
<P>
   This option is under ``active discussion,'' he said, but the
Department is waiting to see whether the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, or OPEC, agrees to ease its restrictions on
oil shipments at its meeting next month.
</P>
<P>
   The reserves are to be used only in when there is an
interruption in oil supplies.

TO BYOB OR NOT? ONE OF MANY QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Dining)  
 (af)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ In retrospect, it was the broken glass that started it.
A group of people were sitting around a dinner table here recently
in earnest discussion when one of them knocked over a wineglass.
``Lucky it wasn't an expensive glass,'' someone said.
</P>
<P>
   But suppose it had been expensive, someone else asked. What
would have been the proper response? Just an apology? Replace the
glass? Blame someone else? No one agrees about anything at dinner
parties here, but there was unanimity on one thing that night: wine
etiquette, at home and in a restaurant, has become almost as
complicated a subject as wine itself.
</P>
<P>
   Wine is generally credited for having a civilizing influence on
the people who drink it. Like many civilizing influences, it has
spawned a hoard of customs and protocols. Some are useful, like red
wine with meat; some sentimental, like passing the port to the
left; some obsolete, like long-stemmed glasses; and some just plain
silly, like sniffing corks.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing which are worthwhile and which are a waste of time can
be more valuable than knowing the best Bordeaux vintages or being
on the Grace Family Vineyards ``A'' list.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the care and treatment of sommeliers. You
have just finished a delicious dinner in a good restaurant. The
bill is $200, $160 for food and $40 for wine. Not cheap but well
worth the cost. You gladly add a 20 percent tip, $40. Then your
dinner companion whispers, ``Shouldn't you leave something for the
sommelier?''
</P>
<P>
   The wine was his suggestion, and he did make a point of
discussing it as if you knew something about the subject. But
wasn't the wine included in the price of the dinner, and wasn't the
tip based on the total price _ presumably $32 for the food and $8
for the wine?
</P>
<P>
   We tend to overlook how much the wine we order adds to the tip,
even when we spend more on what we drink than on what we eat, as
wine enthusiasts often do. If the wine bill comes to several
hundred dollars, as it often does these days, should the tip get
even bigger? My feeling is that the 20 percent is adequate, unless
the service was very special _ for example, if it involved going to
considerable effort to locate a particular bottle, or collaborating
with the chef to make the evening special.
</P>
<P>
   More restaurants are moving away from the traditional wine
service of opening the bottle (without placing it on the table),
offering the cork for inspection and pouring a sip of wine to
taste. What does one do with the cork anyway? Sniffing is supposed
to tell you if the wine is bad.
</P>
<P>
   Rubbing it to see if it's wet is supposed to show if the bottle
was properly stored on its side. But isn't that what the sommelier
is supposed to do? As for that preliminary little taste, unless the
wine is truly foul, it isn't going to do much for you.
</P>
<P>
   Most people don't readily recognize corked wine; even experts
often don't detect that moldy smell until the third or fourth
taste, and by then the server is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Calling him back and saying, ``I've changed my mind; this stuff
is corked,'' can be embarrassing. If I know the wine person, I tend
to say ``Just pour it.'' After all, I'll know soon enough if there
are problems.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this tends to confuse some enthusiastic young
wine stewards who have been taught to take pride in this
pre-prandial rigamarole. Happily, some restaurants are bypassing
the wine ballet by bringing wine to the table after it has already
been opened at the bar. The ultimate decision on the wine is still
the client's; it is just that the whole process has been
simplified.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there will always be a few bad bottles, and one day
you may get one of them. Suppose you do feel something is wrong
with the wine but, coward that you are, you're not about to face
down the wine person.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Here's how to do it. Don't say, ``This wine is no good.'' Too
confrontational. Try, ``Taste this and tell me what you think of
it.'' Now you're asking for help. Even if the wine maven thinks the
stuff is OK, it will now be much easier for you to assert yourself
and say, ``I don't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, these little dust-ups are increasingly rare. Corked
bottles were a problem five years ago but much less so now. And
badly made vinegary wine is practically nonexistent. Winemaking,
and bottling, have vastly improved in recent years, and competition
is too intense to let many bad bottles slip through.
</P>
<P>
   To some wine fans, bringing one's own bottle is the solution to
all these problems, including that of high restaurant wine prices.
One word _ no, three: Don't do it. Unless you are very sure the
restaurant welcomes it. A few still do, mostly on the West Coast.
But even there, the picture is changing.
</P>
<P>
   Chez Panisse, in Berkeley, Calif., which once welcomed all
wines, now charges a $15 corkage per bottle. Restaurants pride
themselves on their wine lists and often have major investments in
wine. You wouldn't expect Sirio Maccioni to admit you to Le Cirque
2000 with your own ham sandwich. Why should he welcome you with
your own wine?
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the delicate business of taking wine to a
dinner party, not to drink yourself, of course, but as a gift to
the hosts. Don't be offended if they whisk it away for another
party, one to which you may not be invited.
</P>
<P>
   Most people plan a dinner carefully, right down to the wine they
want to serve. Unless you called in advance and were asked to bring
something specific, don't expect them to change their meal plan for
you.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if it's a small party, you can make a big hit by
offering to bring all the wine. No right-minded host would turn you
down.
</P>
<P>
   As for the little broken-glass contretemps that started all
this, the best reaction would be to persuade the host or hostess to
spend less on glassware. There is nothing more beautiful than a
table set with elegant long-stemmed wineglasses. And nothing more
impractical for the way most people entertain.
</P>
<P>
   From the host's vantage, watching over a dozen or so expensive
glasses at a cocktail or dinner party makes for a long and
nerve-racking evening. Five or six dollars still buys an attractive
glass that will go into the dishwasher, look good on the table and
cause no heart spasms when it shatters on the hardwood floor.
</P>
<P>
   But if spending too much on glasses is foolish, spending too
much on wine for guests is even more so. Not possible? Oh yes it
is. Rare wines are not for everyone's taste. Unless the guests are
demanding connoisseurs, and who invited them anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Wine for a group should be moderately priced, not just to save
money but to provide something everyone will like. Great Bordeaux
is like chamber music; great Beaujolais is like Rodgers and Hart.
And make sure there is enough. Count on a bottle a person at a
dinner. That sounds like a lot but, divided between white and red,
and spread over a long evening, it's not much at all.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more irritating lapses in wine etiquette is making
wine the center of the evening. Wine should be part of the meal,
not the reason for it.
</P>
<P>
   Beware the host who lectures on his wines or, worse, plays wine
games with his hapless guests. A considerable part of the populace
has no objection to a bit of the grape now and then, but little or
no interest beyond that. Blathering on about the recent vintage is
boring; asking someone to guess which glass is the merlot is
boorish. Makes you want to call for a beer. &QL;

`FIRST PERSON': WHAT LIFE MAY DEAL TO BEAST AND MAN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Documentaries and so-called reality programming are not the same
thing, no matter what defenders of the latter may say. Bravo's two
new half-hour Wednesday night series prove it.
</P>
<P>
   When Temple Grandin describes a cow's experience of the
slaughterhouse to Errol Morris on the fascinating ``First Person,''
it's art. When Jay Schadler films a man caring for his wife, who
has Alzheimer's disease, in the tacky ``Talelights,'' it's
voyeurism.
</P>
<P>
   Morris is the documentary filmmaker who did ``The Thin Blue
Line,'' about the murder of a Dallas police officer (a movie so
persuasive that the case was reopened and the man originally
convicted was released from prison), and, most recently, ``
Death,'' about a consultant on executions. Morris has death on his
mind again in the first episodes of ``First Person.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's episode, ``Stairway to Heaven,'' is amorphous
but compelling. Grandin, a college professor, has the distinction
of having designed what many consider a particularly humane
slaughterhouse. But the more she talks about it, the more horrible
the idea of killing animals for food seems. One design feature is a
chute that is curved so that the cows can't be frightened by things
up ahead. All a cow sees, Grandin explains, is the rear end of the
animal in front of her; each animal is shot in the head, and
because the chute walls support the animal it doesn't fall down.
</P>
<P>
   Morris shows film of cows (some of it in slow motion), of meat
hanging from hooks and of a crawling baby in a depth-perception
experiment, plus seemingly unrelated surreally fast-moving clouds.
The result is effectively dreamlike. The episode also spends
considerable time on Grandin's autism.
</P>
<P>
   Sondra London, the subject of a forthcoming episode, has
interesting taste in men. Her story begins with the handsome boy
she dated in high school (``Everyone in my family just loved him,''
but ``he loved graveyards'') who grows up to be a serial killer.
She remembers his telling her once about having seen a girl
undress. His reaction was ``arousal and anger,'' rather than
arousal and pleasure, and he said, ``I'll put a stop to that.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, bored with writing computer manuals for a living, she
wrote to him in prison and suggested doing a book about his life
and crimes. But what makes London's story so compelling is her
relationship with a second serial killer. Her woman-in-love glow is
remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of the future ``I Dismember Mama'' episode is Saul
Kent, whose field is cryonics. His visions of future immortality
involve the creation of new bodies (including a younger, healthier
one for his mother, whose head he has frozen) so that someone might
be physically 21 but with the experience and wisdom of an
octogenarian. Kent was 10 months old when his father died of
rheumatic heart disease, now a curable condition.
</P>
<P>
   The first episode of ``Talelights'' includes a Maine woman (the
daughter of the woman with Alzheimer's) talking about her abusive
husband. Although she agrees on camera to let Schadler (who
hitchhikes in order to meet subjects) film her, her narrative has
the distasteful confessional quality of a segment on ``The Jerry
Springer Show.'' What this show seems to lack, and ``First Person''
has in abundance, is an attempt to understand the subjects on
screen and to suggest a certain universality of need if not of
action.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Bonnie and Clyde, cemeteries and
chicken-fried steak
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I stopped off the other day in a small Southern town, just
inside the East Texas border, to visit an old friend who runs the
local daily.
</P>
<P>
   The stories that a small town has.
</P>
<P>
   The stories that a small-town editor can tell.
</P>
<P>
   We went for lunch at the place where most everybody goes for
lunch. My friend allowed that he hoped we were in time, that they
hadn't run out of food yet.
</P>
<P>
   I checked my watch. It was a few minutes after 12 noon. Surely,
I told him, we're not too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know,'' he said. ``Folks started lining up as early
as half an hour before the doors open. It's that good.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that good: chicken-fried steak, three choices of
vegetables (I had peas and rice and turnip greens), cornbread, hot
rolls and a slice of chocolate pie. The bill for both of us for
less than $14, tax included.
</P>
<P>
   The stories were free.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Mr. So-in-so,'' the editor said, nodding and smiling.
``How-do, Mr. So-in-so,'' he spoke up across the room, loudly.
</P>
<P>
   Then he continued in a quieter voice, just for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. So-in-so's claim to fame is that Bonnie and Clyde once
stole his car, and that was the car they were driving when they
were ambushed and killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. So-in-so, I further learned, is still driving himself at a
somewhat advanced age. Speculation is that he may have lived to
become a greater menace than Bonnie and Clyde.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all look out when we see him coming,'' the editor said.
</P>
<P>
   It's politicking time, I was told, and the hot local race is the
sheriff's election.
</P>
<P>
   The incumbent, it seems, had been dressing up in the disguise of
a homeless person, going around town begging money.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, it all came to light when a misunderstanding of
sorts developed and the cops were called, only to discover that the
homeless man was, indeed, their own high sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   He later explained that it was research for a book on sociology
that he's doing. Obviously, he's not you're average, everyday,
downhome, small-town Texas sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the editorial house. That's the name my friend
the editor has given it.
</P>
<P>
   This is small, white frame house, a few blocks or so from
downtown, where the owner expresses his views in red writing neatly
painted in letters several inches tall along the front of his home.
</P>
<P>
   When he runs out of room _ evidently, he never runs out of
opinions _ he repaints the house white and starts over.
</P>
<P>
   I should have taken better notes, but the only comment I recall
was something to the effect that every time LBJ ran for office he
promised women and minorities everything there was to promise.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the editor insisted that I see their cemetery. I say
``their.'' But it's not everybody's. As the sign at the gate notes,
you have to be ``sanctioned'' to be buried there.
</P>
<P>
   In small Southern towns, not even death puts folks on equal
terms.
</P>
<P>
   I was fascinated by the cemetery's speculator statuary, most
particularly a larger than life-size weeping angel perched atop the
grave of a young man _ ``the only son,'' we are told in hard, cold
marble _ who died in his early 30s down in Mexico, a short time
into the 20th Century.
</P>
<P>
   The editor didn't know that story. But I'd like to think Pancho
Villa was somehow involved. It would fit well with the one about
Bonnie and Clyde.
</P>
<P>
   (P.S. I have to wonder what ``sanctioned'' involves for joining
a cemetery. If it's a vote of the members, that's the kind of
election ol' Lyndon could have appreciated.)

HISTORY HOVERS DARKLY OVER PARIS OPERA'S `WAR AND PEACE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ At the final dress rehearsal of the Paris Opera's new
production of ``War and Peace'' in February, some guests were
evidently piqued by Prokofiev's _ and before him Tolstoy's _ take
on the French invasion of Russia in 1812. The portrayal of Napoleon
as a buffoon and French troops as savages proved too much. At the
curtain call, hearty cheers for Napoleon turned to boos for Marshal
Kutuzov, the Russian general who drove out the French.
</P>
<P>
   Were Parisians really closing ranks around the humbled emperor?
Or were they simply like children heckling the wicked witch in a
pantomime?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a joke,'' said Francesca Zambello, the American who
directed the lavish production, ``a sort of joke.'' Indeed, on
opening night _ in a rare display of unanimity by the Paris Opera's
fickle public _ singers, director, designer, conductor and
orchestra were all given an ovation. And yet it is a measure of the
political force of ``War and Peace'' _ or at least of the second,
``war'' half of the opera _ that it cannot only stir ghosts from
the past but also mirror events of today. Le Monde's critic, for
instance, still saw a ``great anti-French epic'' unfolding at the
Bastille Opera. And it was Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union in
1941 that inspired Prokofiev to adapt Tolstoy's 19th-century
masterpiece, so Stalin could also be imagined hovering over
Kutuzov.
</P>
<P>
   During the scene showing the fall of Moscow _ with French
soldiers committing atrocities and Russian civilians fleeing with
their meager belongings _ it was hard not to be reminded of recent
events in the Balkans and Chechnya, with the twist that Russian
nationalism, mobilized onstage to defend the motherland, is today
supporting a military offensive in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was asked why I hadn't made the production contemporary,''
Zambello said in an interview. ``You only need to watch television.
People can draw the parallels between 1812, 1941 to 1944 and 2000.
Of course two years ago we didn't known Chechnya would be
happening, but it was a conscious decision not to update the
opera.''
</P>
<P>
   A less obvious contemporary dimension is provided by the cast.
In 1990 Zambello directed ``War and Peace'' in Seattle with a
half-American and half-Russian cast. This time most of the singers
are Russian, and all but two of them are performing the opera for
the first time. And many, it seems, are discovering the work
through the prism of Russia's complex transition to democracy,
including the rise to power of its acting president, Vladimir
Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, many of the Russians were in the West for the
first time, and the Soviet experience was very present,'' recalled
Zambello, a 42-year-old New Yorker. ``Now many have Western
careers, some live in the West, so they're straddling the Soviet
Union, Russia and the West. And it's hard for them to ignore what's
happening in Moscow. Some worry there is now a warmonger in the
Kremlin. Two members of the opera chorus are from Chechnya. They
said Putin is like Kutuzov. I said he's more like Napoleon.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Caucasus politics were hardly the reason that Hugues
Gall, the director of the Paris Opera, chose to present this rarely
performed opera. ``I thought, what are we going to do for this
stupid year 2000?'' he said. ``Let's do something special,
something you don't always do. This is the biggest thing we've
done. It's probably the biggest opera ever written.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now ``War and Peace'' had never been put on by the Paris
Opera, and it had been staged only once in Paris, at the Theatre
des Champs-Elysees in 1986, in a Bulgarian National Opera
production directed by the Russian Boris Pokrovsky. A major figure
in the history of Prokofiev's ``War and Peace,'' Pokrovsky was the
first to present all 13 scenes of the two-act opera, at the Bolshoi
Theater in Moscow in 1959, six years after the composer's death. He
was also the first to present the opera at La Scala in Milan, in
1964, and at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   It is not too surprising that ``War and Peace'' was infrequently
performed in the West during the Cold War: not everyone had an
appetite for bombastic Soviet propaganda disguised as hymns of
glory to the Russian people. But there was another reason. With 72
singing roles and huge battle scenes inspired by Prokofiev's love
of cinema (he was a close friend of Eisenstein and wrote the music
for ``Alexander Nevsky'') the opera is immensely expensive to put
on.
</P>
<P>
   The composer would not have been disappointed by the Paris
Opera's production. Even with the overture dropped and about 25
minutes cut from the second half, this is still an ambitious
enterprise, running more than four hours, including intermission,
and costing close to $4 million for the seven performances through
March 11 and seven more scheduled for fall with the same cast.
</P>
<P>
   For the 62 singing roles that survived the cuts, no fewer than
45 singers were hired, most of them Russians making their debuts at
the Paris Opera. (Two of the male lead roles are sung by Americans,
Nathan Gunn and Robert Brubaker.) To the opera's 100-member chorus
were added some 150 extras, many of whom alternated between playing
Russian and French soldiers. And to make them look their parts, the
opera house made 735 costumes and 450 wigs. Both armies were also
well equipped, with dozens of rifles and no fewer than 16 cannons
between them.
</P>
<P>
   One challenge posed by this opera is that it is effectively two
operas: peace and war. The first half, in which Zambello and her
British designer, John MacFarlane, used sliding walls to create
different domestic interiors, is essentially a love story in which
Natasha Rostova (sung to much acclaim by the 28-year-old Russian
soprano Olga Gouriakova) is prevented from marrying her first love,
Andrei Bolkowski ( Gunn) and ends up falling for the ne'er-do-well
Anatole Kuragin (Stefan Margita), to the dismay of Pierre Bezukhov
(Brubaker).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the seven scenes of Act I Prokofiev evidently also felt free
to be lyrical as he follows Natasha's emotional helter-skelter,
with only the act's final chorus, announcing Napoleon's invasion of
Russia, anticipating the nationalist frenzy that follows. (
Zambello and the French-Israeli conductor, Gary Bertini, moved this
chorus from the beginning of Act I, but the change works well.) Act
II, however, caused the composer endless headaches as he tried to
satisfy the Soviet cultural authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Having left Russia at age 26 at the time of the October
Revolution to wander the United States and Europe, Prokofiev
visited Moscow in 1927 and finally settled there in 1936. Three
years later he abandoned his wife, Lina, for a young Communist
Party militant, Myra Mendelssohn, who later helped him write the
libretto to ``War and Peace.'' He began work on the opera in August
1941, and in April of the following year he sent 11 scenes, six for
peace and five for war, for official approval.
</P>
<P>
   The response from the Committee for Artistic Affairs was
negative, and he was invited to be more lyrical and to give greater
emphasis to the role of the Russian people. Prokofiev made
revisions, adding a scene to Act I. And eventually, thanks to
friends, the first eight scenes were staged in 1945. Yet when Act
II was presented in 1947, the authorities banned the work after
just one performance. The opera lacked heroism and patriotism,
Prokofiev was told. By the time he died in 1953 (one day before
Stalin), he had never seen a performance of the entire opera.
</P>
<P>
   With today's eyes, Act II seems drenched in heroism and
patriotism. In the Paris Opera production a dramatic back curtain
of dark clouds and splashes of light changes color to suit the mood
of the story as Kutuzov (Anatoly Kotcherga) prepares his soldiers
for war, Napoleon (Vasily Gerello) appears on the battlefield of
Borodino, Moscow is occupied and burned, Natasha finds the dying
Andrei, and finally Napoleon's dejected and humiliated troops
retreat.
</P>
<P>
   French critics singled out Zambello's command of her own army of
singers and extras as she led them in battles and forced marches:
at one point, almost 300 people are on stage. ``Francesca Zambello
takes us to the center of the horrors of war,'' Le Figaro's music
critic, Pierre-Petit, wrote. ``Cannons are dragged onstage, torches
blaze, people run, are wounded, are killed. We're even shown
summary executions carried out against tottering walls.''
</P>
<P>
   Zambello, who has already demonstrated her ability to direct
large crowds in ``Billy Budd,'' said that in some ways Act I was
more difficult. ``In war you are the general of the battlefield,''
she said. ``In peace you're trying to squeeze 1,500 pages of
Tolstoy into eight minutes and make the characters resonate even
though you won't see them for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, if ``War and Peace,'' too, tended to vanish from sight
for long stretches after each production (the last in the United
States was in San Francisco in 1991), that now appears to be
changing, thanks not only to the Paris Opera. A new co-production
of the work by the Kirov Opera and the Metropolitan Opera is to
open in St. Petersburg on March 11, will travel to Covent Garden in
London in July and to La Scala in September. It is scheduled to
reach the Met in the 2001-02 season.

</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ANNIE NAKAO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Republican Rep. Tom Campbell called Democratic
Sen. Dianne Feinstein ``China's best friend'' and urged
California's senior senator to take a tough position against
Beijing's recent threats against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, who represents the San Jose area, hopes to unseat
Feinstein in this year's election.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference held Monday outside the Chinese Consulate
in San Francisco, Campbell challenged Feinstein to warn Beijing
that using force against Taiwan would sabotage its entry into the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued later in the day by Feinstein did not refer
to Campbell but said China's ``bellicose statements'' toward Taiwan
were ``counterproductive and regrettable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have indicated my strong disapproval and deep concern to
China,'' the statement said. ``A peaceful resolution of the Taiwan
issue is the only constructive alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Although both seek eventual reunification, mainland China
considers the island of Taiwan to be a renegade province. Beijing
has recently indicated it was willing to use force to reunite the
two.
</P>
<P>
   Wang Yunxiang, Beijing's consul general in San Francisco, was
unruffled by what Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Connecting the Taiwan issue with the WTO is absurd,'' Wang
said. ``They are two different things.''
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's threats against Taiwan, made in a recent policy
document, came just weeks before the island's national elections on
March 18. The timing is not unusual. Before the 1996 presidential
election, the People's Republic of China fired missiles off
Taiwan's shores.
</P>
<P>
   Wang said the harsher tact is aimed at carrying out Beijing's
``one China'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reflects the common aspirations of the Chinese people,''
Wang said. ``Hong Kong was returned to the motherland in 1997. We
have one country, two systems. We can see that is very much
successful. Then, in December, Macao was returned. Now, I think the
Taiwan issue is being brought to our agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``political negotiation'' is unsuccessful, Wang said, ``The
central government will have to take nonpeaceful means.''
</P>
<P>
   The sovereignty of Taiwan has been a tinderbox issue since
Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist forces fled there after losing to the
Communist forces under Mao Zedong.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said any threats of force would be ``absolutely
contrary to the purposes of the WTO'' and would sink any chance
that China's entry into trade body would be ratified this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their statement about the use of military force to take Taiwan
is utterly unacceptable,'' Campbell said. Advocates representing
nine Taiwanese-American organizations joined Campbell at the news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not one inch of Taiwan was ever part of the PRC,'' said
Keelong Hong, a medical researcher at the California Pacific
Medical Center who heads the North American Taiwanese Professors
Association. ``China must renounce its use of force.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis Chang, a retired San Jose State University accounting
professor and president of the Hakka Association of America,
accused China of destabilizing Taiwan because it is threatened by
the election in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They like to intimidate people,'' he said. ``But people should
have the right to elect their own president.''

 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Visiting a little show called ``Squonk'' during its
brief run in the East Village last summer was like walking into a
neighbor's garage and discovering a homemade fun house. Staged in
one of the upstairs rooms of Performance Space 122, ``Squonk'' was
clearly a product of obsessive, original minds and limited means.
</P>
<P>
   Its performers, five fashionably nerdy-looking musicians from
Pittsburgh, might have been plucked from the audience. (This  &UR; was &LR; 
the East Village in August.) And for 80 minutes of crude but
persuasive spectacle, they managed to lure those watching them into
an alternative reality. It was a funky, friendly and somewhat
precious experience, a chemical-free New Age-style head trip.
</P>
<P>
   If life were an MGM movie from the 1940s, the plucky souls of
``Squonk'' would be discovered by big-time producers and whisked
off to a glamorous theater on the Great White Way. Well, for once
life has imitated a Judy and Mickey musical: ``Squonk'' opened
Tuesday night at the Helen Hayes Theater on Broadway. Unfortunately
the requisite MGM-style happy ending has not been provided.
</P>
<P>
   To put it simply, ``Squonk'' has shrunk, almost to the point of
invisibility. Placing this small, eccentric charmer in a Broadway
house is a brutally misguided transplant.
</P>
<P>
   So much of the original appeal of ``Squonk,'' the collaborative
creation of which has been overseen by Steve O'Hearn and Jackie
Dempsey and which is directed by Tom Diamond, had to do with its
creators' control of the environment in which it was performed.
Presented as a goof of a fever dream in a surreal restaurant, the
show kept springing surprises that required the audience to be
close at hand and, often, part of the action.
</P>
<P>
   There were flashlights beamed directly into theatergoers' eyes,
for example, and a giant tongue that reached past the front row.
There was also the sense that the performers might materialize
anywhere at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   The music, too, an Enya-esque, narcotically repetitive blend of
the ethereal and the sinister, seemed all-pervasive, so insistent
that it clouded the perceptions. And there were assorted
trompe-l'oeil tricks, involving items like eggs and electric
blenders, that required close viewing to work.
</P>
<P>
   Seen from the far side of a proscenium, on a stage that looks to
be the same size as the entire room at PS 122, the illusions of
``Squonk'' shrivel, and its shaping visual metaphors become
incomprehensible. There are some newly enlarged mechanical monsters
and an eye-catching backdrop showing an endless landscape of
restaurant tables, but everything now registers at a far,
bewildering remove, even the music.
</P>
<P>
   None of the talented ensemble members (T. Weldon Anderson,
Dempsey, Kevin Kornicki, Jana Losey and O'Hearn) have learned how
to stylize and enlarge their presence and gestures in compensatory
ways. The free-form dancing and the staged battles of dueling
musical instruments now come across as clunky. The overall effect
is of listening to someone recite last night's dream over the
breakfast table. If it's not your dream, you're likely to feel
bored or embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal shame in all of this is that had ``Squonk'' been
reincarnated in a smaller, appropriately configured theater, it
might have thrived as the kind of quirky show event that tourists
could wander into and feel they had come upon something quaint and
bohemian (e.g., ``Blue Man Group,'' ``De La Guarda''). As it is,
the production sadly echoes the real estate agent's credo: Location
is everything.

`ALONE' AND `THE LITTLE THIEF': SCHOOL OF HARD KNOCKS AND ITS
GRADUATE PROGRAM

<P>
   NEW YORK _ For Amelie and Esse (or ``S''), life is about to go
from not very good to far worse.
</P>
<P>
   Amelie and Esse are, respectively, the protagonists of ``Alone''
and ``The Little Thief,'' two absorbing, meticulously observed
studies of rootless youth fueled by rebelliousness, anger and
anomie in a double bill by Erick Zonca that plays for two weeks
beginning Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Zonca is the same French-born filmmaker whose debut film,
``Dreamlife of Angels,'' about two young Frenchwomen adrift, won
best actress honors for its stars at the Cannes International Film
Festival and further acclaim when it was shown as the concluding
film in the New York Film festival in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alone,'' which takes only 34 minutes to track Amelie's descent
from rejection in a tryout as a waitress to desperado to police
prisoner, was filmed before ``Dreamlife of Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   Made after ``Dreamlife,'' ``The Little Thief,'' to which
``Alone'' compares as a short story does to a novella, takes 65
minutes to map Esse's route from apprentice baker in Orleans to
apprentice gangster in Marseille and back to apprentice baker.
</P>
<P>
   In neither film does Zonca's subject utter more than a few
words, but his gift lies in an eloquent choice of detail as he
tells his stories through the eyes of his quietly expressive
actors.
</P>
<P>
   Amelie (Florence Loiret), criticized for her clothes, her talk
and her attitude, loses her waitress' job as soon as she arrives
late for work one day. A dispute with her landlord, she explains to
her boss. ``You better change everything,'' he advises, handing her
a few hundred francs. She goes home to discover that new tenants
are occupying her apartment, and that the landlord intends to keep
most of her belongings until she pays him several thousand francs
in back rent.
</P>
<P>
   As Amelie sits disconsolate in a rear yard, a commotion in an
apartment above directs her eyes upward. A young man, clearly
besieged by the authorities, reaches out the window and tries to
hide an automatic pistol by balancing it on a drainpipe. The weapon
falls beside Amelie, who picks it up and goes on her way.
</P>
<P>
   Her impulse is to seek an honest living. With little to offer,
she meets with scant success. She tries in vain to learn to beg.
The only apparent friend she makes steals what is left of her
belongings, except for the pistol. Hungry, alone, forlorn,
increasingly desperate, Amelie decides to put the weapon to use.
</P>
<P>
   Like Amelie, Esse (Nicolas Duvauchelle) loses his job and his
living quarters when he turns up late at the outset of ``The Little
Thief'' and is told he is bound for trouble. Unlike her, he is
dismissive and defiant.
</P>
<P>
   Esse tells his girlfriend, Sandra (Emilie Lafarge), he doesn't
intend to be anyone's slave. Rather than be a victim, he'll take
advantage of others. Sandra asks him what he intends to be, a
gangster?
</P>
<P>
   That night, after sleeping with Sandra, Esse steals her pay
envelope and when next seen is the apprentice in a Marseille gang
that specializes in burglary, prostitution and waterfront theft.
</P>
<P>
   As the newcomer, Esse's duties include participation in
burglaries, keeping an eye on a prostitute, occasionally driving
for the big boss and tending to an ailing elderly woman who turns
out to be the mother of his immediate boss, Sylvain, also known as
the Eye (Jean-Jerome Esposito).
</P>
<P>
   In time, in the boxing club that the Eye introduces him to, and
far more brutally in the conduct of the gang, Esse will discover
that he is not such a tough guy after all. Perhaps he can cheat
death, but for him, and for Amelie, destiny is another matter.
</P>

`AUTHENTIC VIETNAMESE COOKING': BASIC VIETNAMESE COOKING AS A
CULINARY CROSSROADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Dining)  
 (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The story of Corinne Trang's family personifies the story of
Vietnam. And so her book, ``Authentic Vietnamese Cooking'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster, $30), not only serves as a good introduction to the
cuisine, but also gives a sense of how the country's history has
shaped its food.
</P>
<P>
   Trang's father, grandparents and aunts and uncles lived in
China, Cambodia and Vietnam, ``moving from place to place, country
to country, and culture to culture'' to avoid political turmoil,
she writes. She was born and raised in France _ her mother is
French _ and traveled to Asia as a child and as an adult both
before and after settling in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this personal history is outlined in a short but lovely
preface, replete with vintage black-and-white pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Trang points out that Vietnam has long been a culinary
crossroads, a cuisine influenced by French, Chinese, Cambodian,
Thai, Indian, Russian and even American tastes. And yet, Vietnamese
cooking is usually quite simple. All those influences of traders
and invaders did not catapult the cuisine into the ranks of the
world's greatest, especially compared with Thai or Chinese cooking.
Nevertheless, they made it more interesting than the cuisines of
many other small countries.
</P>
<P>
   What make the cuisine lively and appealing are the frequently
appearing flavors of garlic, ginger, scallion, lemongrass, soy,
fish sauce (called nuoc mam here, nam pla in Thailand) and a
plethora of fresh herbs, especially mint, Thai basil and cilantro.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks at least in part to the French influence, Vietnamese
cooking can also be quite subtle, and Trang's recipes largely
capture those subtleties. They call for small amounts of assertive
flavors _ though chilies are used in many dishes, fiery food is
rarely served in Vietnam _ and combine them to create synergies
that are not only complex but even mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes originated with Trang's Vietnamese relatives and
friends and, she writes, are all from the ``family table.'' In
Vietnam as in many Third World countries, home and restaurant
cooking are closely linked. The exception is pho, the staple daily
soup, a rich broth loaded with noodles, a couple of kinds of meat,
an assortment of vegetables and sometimes tofu; it is easier for
restaurants to make.
</P>
<P>
   The hundred or so recipes in Trang's book feel unified, and many
confusing techniques are simplified. Generally, the recipes are
accurate and written with reasonable clarity, and the attractive
design enhances the book's overall usefulness _ although older
cooks might wish that a larger type had been used for the recipe
directions.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe selection is representative of basic Vietnamese
cooking, and little has been left out: there are a couple of rice
porridges, three classic phos, braised fish in caramel sauce and a
classic duck recipe called laque. There are surprises as well, like
a braised pork shank in coconut juice.
</P>
<P>
   But I was disappointed that the book didn't go further. A
section on frogs and snails contains no snail recipes and only two
obvious recipes for frogs' legs. The poultry chapter contains only
seven recipes _ after five pages of introductory text _ and again
they are the most obvious choices. Worse, two of them are virtually
identical save for the main ingredient and roasting time.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly one could expect a little more range in a 250-page,
$30 book. If you already own a good Vietnamese cookbook, like
Nicole Routhier's ``Foods of Vietnam'' (Stewart, Tabori &AMP; Chang,
1989), you may find ``Authentic Vietnamese Cooking'' superfluous.
If you do not, it's a good starting place. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LAQUE DUCK &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``Authentic Vietnamese Cooking'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: about 90 minutes, plus 24 hours' marination  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup nuoc mam
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon thick soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons honey
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons five-spice powder
</P>
<P>
   1 5-pound duck
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces ginger, peeled, cut into 4 slices and lightly crushed
</P>
<P>
   4 scallions, trimmed, halved crosswise, and lightly crushed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Whisk together nuoc mam, soy sauce, honey and five-spice
powder in a broad, deep dish. Carefully loosen skin of the duck by
gently running your fingers between the skin and the meat, trying
not to tear the skin; you may need a paring knife at first.
</P>
<P>
   2. Place the duck in the dish and rub the marinade over it,
inside and out and between the flesh and the skin. Drain and
refrigerate the duck, uncovered, for 24 hours, turning
occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   3. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Place the ginger and
scallions inside the duck, then truss it. Use a metal skewer to
poke the skin all over. Place the duck, with the breast side down,
on a rack in a roasting pan and roast for 45 minutes, basting every
15 minutes with the drippings. Turn the duck breast side up and
continue roasting, still basting every 15 minutes, until the juices
run clear, about 45 minutes more. Carve and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 2 to 3 servings as a main course.

 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - The nation's governors overwhelmingly agree that
every retail sale, whether made in a mall or online, should get
equal tax treatment. But achieving such fairness may mean
eliminating all sales taxes, Gov. Michael Leavitt, R-Utah, said
Tuesday at the close of the National Governors' Association
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four out of five governors believe we have to move to a level
playing field,'' rather than leave Main Street merchants at a tax
disadvantage, said Leavitt, who chairs the bipartisan organization.
That could mean imposing taxes on Internet purchases, or radically
restructuring state finances to wipe all sales taxes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, governors want to retain the power to set sales
tax policy, he said. Currently, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is
pushing a plan to have Congress pre-empt states with a permanent
ban on taxes on Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   After a private meeting with most members of the Senate, the
governors emerged with no consensus on taxes. But a decision must
be made within two years or ``the opportunity will be lost'' amid
the frenzied growth of electronic commerce, Leavitt said.
</P>
<P>
   The governors' association is now backing away from its own
proposal, which recommended state governments create a ``trusted
third party'' to collect and remit sales taxes on Internet
purchases. During their meeting, the governors realized that any
plan creating another bureaucracy would not survive, Leavitt said.
</P>
<P>
   But the possibility of eliminating all sales taxes remains on
the table, he said. Such a change would be wrenching for the 45
states that now collect them. Sales taxes provide a third of
revenues for most states and local governments, raising more than
$150 billion each year.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, states require brick-and-mortar retailers to collect
taxes on purchases. But online and mail-order merchants collect
taxes only from customers who live in the same state. ``Remote
sales,'' made to residents of states where the merchants have no
operations, generally escape taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Governors are worried about the shift to electronic commerce,
which now amounts to about $20 billion a year. If Internet sales
continue tripling every year as they have been, states will be
losing about $10.8 billion annually by 2003, according to a recent
study by the University of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The governors also discussed the problem Monday with President
Clinton, who urged them to move quickly. Otherwise, shoppers will
grow so accustomed to tax-free shopping on the Internet that
governors will find it politically impossible to begin imposing
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But while most governors want a uniform tax system that treats
all purchases alike, whether made in stores, by mail order, by
phone or online, a few object, saying they don't want to threaten
the economy's ``golden goose.'' Gov. James Gilmore, R-Va., says the
Internet's fantastic growth has created so many jobs in his state
that revenues from income and property taxes are soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes, D-Ga., left the gathering unpersuaded that
swift action, either by Congress or state legislatures, is
necessary because the Internet economy is still fragile. ``We don't
want to stop the growth of the Internet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NGA vice chairman Gov. Parris Glendening, D-Md., said that while
the sales tax question is unsettled, all governors agree Internet
access should not be taxed.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gilmore and Leavitt are among the 19 members of the
Congressionally appointed Advisory Commission on Electronic
Commerce. That group, composed of federal, state, business and
consumer leaders, is studying the Internet tax question and is due
to send recommendations to Congress by April 21.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Congress is imposing a nationwide moratorium on taxes
aimed specifically at the Internet until October 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is likely to extend that moratorium for perhaps two
years to allow more time for debate. Leavitt said most governors
would not object to such an extension.

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Tuna Tartar Keeps Diners Coming Back   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Tuna tartare, a mix of chopped raw fish and
seasonings, has become a popular appetizer at trendy restaurants.
In many cases, the chefs add so much to the fish that its delicacy
is obliterated, but this version by Scott Newman at Rubicon is
different. It's as pared down as the restaurant's handsome
interior.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Newman's recipe includes only a few complementary ingredients _
radish, shallots and ginger _ that accentuate the tuna, rather than
mask it. The soy vinaigrette consists of only two other elements _
lemon and olive oil _ to balance the salty liquid. This dish is so
good that it has become one of the most popular at the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Rubicon has won raves for its food but it has garnered as much
publicity for its celebrity owners _ Robert De Niro and Robin
Williams, among others.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is the epitome of urban sophistication _ thick
brick walls and black metal earthquake beams are paired with
refined mahogany and starched white linens.
</P>
<P>
   Rubicon also has a great wine list and the country's best
sommelier, Larry Stone. Clearly, the restaurant is at the top of
its game.

SECRETS OF SUCCESS
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Selecting the tuna. &LR;  We all like a bargain but the best fresh
tuna is never cheap. Don't skimp on the quality or the taste and
texture will be inferior.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ A sharp knife. &LR;  A good edge is essential to get a clean cut
on the tuna. A dull knife will mash and tear the flesh, destroying
the texture.

   &QL; 
TUNA TARTARE WITH SOY VINAIGRETTE
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 pound top-quality fresh tuna, cut into 1/4-inch dice
</P>

   3 shallots, finely diced
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh ginger

<P>
   1 package (1 ounce) daikon sprouts
</P>
<P>
   Toast points

   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Place the tuna in a large bowl. Add the scallions, cilantro,
shallots, ginger and half of the julienned radishes; stir gently to
combine.
</P>
<P>
   Whisk together the olive oil, soy sauce and lemon juice until
well blended. Stir half of this vinaigrette into the tuna mixture,
then season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle a serving platter with the remaining radishes and the
daikon sprouts. Gently form the tartare mixture into a mound and
place in the center of the platter. Drizzle the remaining
vinaigrette over the tartare and serve with toast points.

EDITORS NOTE: Here's a plan for getting quick meals on the table in
a hurry. Now &AMP; Later is a recipe cooked on the weekend in batches _
enough to serve 12 _ and functions as dinner on the night it's
prepared; freeze the rest for two future meals. The 30-Minute Main
Dish takes a half-hour or less of preparation and Fast &AMP; Fresh
gives you dinner in about 20 minutes. 
 
 THE WORKING COOK: Diners Join the Party by Building Their Own 
 Tacos   By Tara Duggan  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  My family claims no Mexican heritage, but at
gatherings my uncle Brent often tells stories of how he used
cranked out a taco or two a minute when he worked in a Lake Tahoe
snack stand during his summer vacations.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes we still get to have taco night when we visit him.
He's still fast, which means the fried tortillas are crispy and hot
when they get to the table. Inside is piquant ground beef, shredded
cheese and cool, crisp lettuce. As you pick them up, hot, spicy oil
dribbles down your wrists. Delicious!
</P>
<P>
   This week's 30-Minute Main Dish _ Shrimp Tacos with Black Pepper
Slaw _ is my Y2K version of the the now all-American taco. Golden
tortillas wrap up cool green cabbage slaw, rosy shrimp and bright
orange mango salsa. The slaw, with its rush of lime juice and fresh
ground pepper, is an appealing counterpoint to the sweet, garlicky
shrimp and fruity salsa. The best part is when you bring all the
components to the table and everyone builds their own tacos.
</P>
<P>
   In the Fast &AMP; Fresh recipe _ Pork Chops With Polenta and
Balsamic Reduction _ the reduced vinegar makes a simple but
complex-tasting sauce that works particularly well with pork.
</P>
<P>
   Prepared polenta may not have the satisfyingly creamy texture of
homemade, but a few minutes under the broiler turns it into a fine
side dish for the pork and a delectable sponge for the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   The Now &AMP; Later recipe _ Bread Soup With Garlic and Wilted
Greens _ is a hearty vegetarian soup that takes little time to
make. The wilted cabbage and kale enrich the savory broth, while
the toasted bread adds texture. Delicate sorrel contributes a hint
of citrus; if sorrel is unavailable, squeeze in some lemon juice.
And the raw garlic rubbed on the toast and infused in the broth
packs a wallop that will lick any winter cold.

   PORK CHOPS WITH POLENTA &AMP; BALSAMIC REDUCTION
</P>
<P>
   If you have a grill pan, use it to broil the pork chops. If not,
leave room for them on the baking sheet and cook next to the
polenta.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 small shallot
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup aged balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup low-salt chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   1 (35-ounce) roll prepared polenta (see note)
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt + salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper + pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon paprika
</P>
<P>
   4 center-cut boneless pork loin chops (about 6 ounces each),
about 3/4 inch thick
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Heat oven to broil. Position rack at top of oven with room to
fit a pan under the broiler.
</P>
<P>
   Mince the shallot. Melt 1/2 tablespoon of the butter in a small
saucepan. Add the shallot and saute for 1 minute. Add the vinegar,
chicken broth and bay leaf. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to
medium-low and keep at a low boil for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   If you're using one, place a grill pan in the oven to heat.
</P>
<P>
   Slice the polenta into eight 1/2-inch-thick rounds (you will
have one third of the roll left). Arrange on a small baking sheet
lined with aluminum foil and place under the broiler.
</P>
<P>
   Mix together the salt, pepper and paprika. Season the pork chops
on both sides with this spice mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Flip over the polenta rounds and return to a lower rack of the
oven. Put the pork chops on the hot grill pan and place directly
under the broiler. Broil for 4 minutes, then turn the chops and
broil 1 minute longer. Remove both the polenta and the pork chops
from the oven.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the balsamic reduction from the heat and whisk in the
remaining 11/2 tablespoons butter. Season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, place each pork chop on 2 polenta rounds and drizzle
liberally with sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.
</P>

<P>
   Lightly crush 2 garlic cloves and rub the bread slices with
them. Toast the bread in the preheated oven for 10 minutes on each
side. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Thinly slice the onions; mince the remaining garlic.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the olive oil in a large stockpot. Add the onions and saute
over medium heat until lightly caramelized, about 15 minutes. Add
the minced garlic and saute for 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Peel the potatoes and cut into medium dice. Trim off 3 inches
from the stem ends of the kale; cut the leaves into 1/2-inch
ribbons.

 WINE POTPOURRI: California Wine Business Thrives in Spite of 
 Protests   By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  North Coast wineries and grape growers are under
attack from a variety of people who claim that grape growing is
ruining the environment. The protesters say that new vineyards are
squeezing out other agriculture and that vineyards, in general, are
not very friendly to an already delicate environment.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The protests, which seem to be growing in number, have been
making wine cultivators crazy, but seem to have had little impact
on a healthy California wine economy. According to a recently
released report commissioned by the Wine Institute and the
California Association of Winegrape Growers (CAWG), California wine
is the No.1 finished agricultural product in retail value,
accounting for $33 million in wages, revenues and economic
activity. Independent wine industry consultants, Motto, Kryla &AMP;
Fisher LLP prepared the report.
</P>
<P>
   The report is packed with gee-whiz statistics. For example,
California's wine industry generated an estimated $12.3 billion in
retail sales in the United States in 1998 and another $1.2 billion
in tourism directly related to the wine business. ``California, if
it were a nation, would be the fourth leading wine producer
worldwide,'' the report crows.
</P>
<P>
   Providing some counter-thoughts to the often overwrought
argument of those who see the California wine industry as the evil
empire, is CAWG president Karen Ross.
</P>
<P>
   ``California's wine community is uniquely tied to the land and
natural resources of this state. Vineyards represent a long-term
commitment with a significant statewide investment mainly by
families and family-owned corporations,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   California also led the nation in retail wine sales in 1998 with
$2.6 billion, followed by New York, Florida, Texas and Illinois.
Nevada and the District of Columbia, long believed to be major wine
markets, are 23rd and 33rd respectively in retail wine sales.
</P>
<P>
   Coming on the heels of the wine industry report is a look at
wine grape acreage, prices and yield trends since 1990 by Richard
Cartiere in his Wine Market Report, released at the California
Grape Crush Report Forum last month.
</P>
<P>
   Cartiere says that approximately 250,000 acres were newly
planted and redeveloped since the spring of 1990 and that the
investment is conservatively estimated to reach $5 billion in the
first half of 2000. He predicts that wine grape acreage should
reach 530,000 acres, up 60 percent since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Wine Q &AMP; A
</P>
<P>
   _ Sasikala Devi of McKinleyville, enjoyed the recent piece on
Chartreuse, maintaining that the liqueur is best served neat and at
room temperature. She also wondered about a special bottling of
Chartreuse labeled V.E.P. Vieillissement Exceptionnellement
Prolong &LR; e &LR;  (VEP) loosely means ``extra (prolonged) aging in wood
vats.'' Chartreuse V.E.P. is aged 12 years in wood and is available
in both original yellow and green at $103, compared to the regular
bottling for $45.
</P>
<P>
   _ Michael Duca of San Francisco, wanted to know why recent
coverage of Italian wines only mentioned the wines of Piedmont and
Tuscany, and not the value wines from Sicily and other lesser known
Italian wine regions. Good point. Sicily has a reputation among
Americans, but it isn't about Sicilian wines. Keep reading, Sicily
is slotted in as a subject for a future Wine Potpourri.

 &HT;    GOVERNORS PONDERING A BAN ON ALL SALES TAXES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's governors overwhelmingly agree that
every retail sale, whether made in a mall or on line, should get
equal tax treatment. But achieving such fairness may mean
eliminating all sales taxes, Gov. Michael Leavitt, R-Utah, said
Tuesday at the close of the National Governors' Association
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four out of five governors believe we have to move to a level
playing field'' rather than leave Main Street merchants at a tax
disadvantage, said Leavitt, who chairs the bipartisan organization.
That could mean either imposing taxes on Internet purchases or
radically restructuring state finances to wipe all sales taxes, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, governors want to retain the power to set sales
tax policy, he said. Currently, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is
pushing a plan to have Congress pre-empt states with a permanent
ban on taxes on Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   After a private meeting with most members of the Senate, the
governors emerged with no consensus on taxes. But a decision must
be made within two years or ``the opportunity will be lost'' amid
the frenzied growth of electronic commerce, Leavitt said.
</P>
<P>
   The governors' association is now backing away from its own
proposal, which recommended state governments create a ``trusted
third party'' to collect and remit sales taxes on Internet
purchases. During their meeting, the governors realized that any
plan creating another bureaucracy would not survive, Leavitt said.
</P>
<P>
   But the possibility of eliminating all sales taxes remains on
the table, he said. Such a change would be wrenching for the 45
states that now collect them. Sales taxes provide one-third to
one-half of revenues for most states and local governments, raising
more than $150 billion each year.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, states require brick-and-mortar retailers to collect
taxes on purchases. But online and mail-order merchants collect
taxes only from customers who live in the same state. ``Remote
sales,'' made to residents of states where the merchants have no
operations, generally escape taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Governors are worried about the shift to electronic commerce,
which now amounts to about $20 billion a year. If Internet sales
continue tripling every year as they have been, states will be
losing about $10.8 billion annually by 2003, according to a recent
study by the University of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The governors also discussed the problem Monday with President
Clinton, who urged them to move quickly. Otherwise, shoppers will
grow so accustomed to tax-free shopping on the Internet that
governors will find it politically impossible to begin imposing
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But while most governors want a uniform tax system that treats
all purchases alike, a few object, saying they don't want to
threaten the economy's ``golden goose.'' Gov. James Gilmore, R-Va.,
says the Internet's fantastic growth has created so many jobs in
his state that revenues from income and property taxes are soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes, D-Ga., left the gathering unpersuaded that
swift action, either by Congress or state legislatures, is
necessary because the Internet economy is still fragile. ``We don't
want to stop the growth of the Internet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NGA vice chairman Gov. Parris Glendening, D-Md., said that while
the sales tax question is unsettled, all governors agree Internet
access should not be taxed.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gilmore and Leavitt are among the 19 members of the
congressionally appointed Advisory Commission on Electronic
Commerce. That group, composed of federal, state, business and
consumer leaders, is studying the Internet tax question and is due
to send recommendations to Congress by April 21.
</P>

IN GLORY'S SHADOW': INVADING A CITADEL OF HOSTILE ATTITUDES

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's probably safe to say that many feminists, myself included,
gave Shannon Faulkner the same kind of grimacing endorsement that
we would accord to, say, prostitutes. We supported Faulkner's right
to be what she wanted to be: the first female cadet to attend the
Citadel, the all-male, publicly-financed military college in
Charleston, S.C. At the same time, we wondered why on earth anyone
would want to pursue such a unpalatable vocation in the first
place. After all, the Citadel has figured in the post-1960s
American popular imagination as an anachronistic and deeply weird
place: a haven for young men who read ``The Lord of the Flies'' in
high school and thought that Piggy deserved what he got.
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, the year Faulkner breached the Citadel's confines,
enrollment had diminished so drastically that the corps of cadets
might have been expected to welcome just about any able-bodied
applicant _ even a woman _ who would plump up their numbers. But,
as Catherine S. Manegold recounts in her new book, ``In Glory's
Shadow,'' during Faulkner's three-year legal battle to gain
admission, she was subjected to death threats, obscenities (some
spray-painted on her parents' house), and lesser attacks, like
being dubbed ``the divine bovine'' in the school newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The years of harassment and the looming prospect of being one
woman isolated among nearly 2,000 mostly angry men eventually took
their toll. The summer before Faulkner entered the Citadel,
Manegold discloses, she asked her mother to make an appointment for
her with a gynecologist. If she was raped, Faulkner explained, she
didn't want to become pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner spent most of her few days as a cadet in the infirmary;
when, stressed to the breaking point, she left the Citadel, cadets
gathered near the gates to sing ``Hey, hey, the witch is dead!''
Others flexed their muscles in unison.
</P>
<P>
   ``An odd truth lay hidden deep within'' the Citadel men's rage,
writes Manegold, a former reporter for The New York Times. ``Their
passion and their persistence grew not from what they wanted to
preserve but from what they knew they had already lost.''
</P>
<P>
   This is only one of the elegantly astute passages in the book,
which chronicles not only Faulkner's legal struggle (which
ultimately wound up in the Supreme Court) but also the intricate
social and psychological history of the Citadel from its founding
in 1842 to its flailing at the advent of Faulkner and the women
cadets who would succeed her.
</P>
<P>
   Manegold covered Faulkner's story for The Times, and most of her
insights in ``In Glory's Shadow'' are smart and informed.
Sometimes, though she gets a little too giddy at the prospect of
breaking loose from her reporter's rigor and indulges in the kind
of grandiose game of connect-the-dots between historical context
and individual lives that literary critics like Stanley Fish have
bemoaned as the flaw of modern biographies in particular. Here is
how the author introduces Faulkner's lead lawyer, Valorie Vojdik:
</P>
<P>
   ``Vojdik was four when the Tonkin Gulf resolution was signed,
the same year that Stanley Kubrik's `Dr. Strangelove' mocked a
military mind-set gone berserk.'' She was ``14 when the House
Judiciary Committee recommended that the president be impeached.
... Against that backdrop of war and political turmoil, Vojdik
learned early that nothing was quite fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Well maybe or maybe not. Other kids who grew up during that same
period went on to join the Young Americans for Freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Those occasional lapses of analytic prudence aside, the years of
research and interviews Manegold conducted while covering the
Faulkner story allow her to offer nuanced and sometimes offbeat
readings of the story and the people involved.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, she broaches the interesting theory that a prime
mover behind the Citadel's hostile treatment of Faulkner was the
long-deceased four-star general, Mark Clark, the school's
charismatic president from the mid-1950s to the mid-'60s, during
which time it fought fiercely against racial integration.
</P>
<P>
   As Manegold observes, the cadets who had once been ``Mark
Clark's boys'' (and thus shaped by his diehard traditionalist
attitudes) had become the men running the Citadel by the time
Faulkner applied for admission.
</P>
<P>
   Manegold's rendering of Faulkner herself resists hagiography.
She comes across as a spunky, likable young woman whose initial
application to the Citadel (in which she successfully masked her
gender) was motivated not only by outrage that a publicly financed
school could exclude women but by an impish desire to stir things
up as well. The author points out the irony that Faulkner ``was a
modern teen-ager who did not believe in rote obedience yet chose to
pit herself against an institution that taught it as a religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Manegold's most provocative ``character'' readings
are lavished on the Citadel itself, arguably the principal player
in the Faulkner drama. In the hazings and humiliations that define
the life of a first-year student. She ingeniously perceives a
fascination with a pre-Civil War paradigm of mastery and
subjugation that dates to the school's earliest days. Writing of
the promise of community and the yearning to be tested that lure so
many students to the Citadel, the author says of Shannon and her
classmates: ``They went to find their way, as though old maps could
help them navigate in a new world.''
</P>
<P>
   In her engrossing book, Manegold helps skeptical readers like me
understand, at least somewhat, why Faulkner fought so hard to get
into the Citadel; she also makes us understand why, once she made
it inside the walls, Faulkner would use the last reserves of her
strength to turn around and bolt.

 &HT;    GOVERNORS PONDERING A BAN ON ALL SALES TAXES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's governors overwhelmingly agree that
every retail sale, whether made in a mall or on line, should get
equal tax treatment. But achieving such fairness may mean
eliminating all sales taxes, Gov. Michael Leavitt, R-Utah, said
Tuesday at the close of the National Governors' Association
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four out of five governors believe we have to move to a level
playing field'' rather than leave Main Street merchants at a tax
disadvantage, said Leavitt, who chairs the bipartisan organization.
That could mean either imposing taxes on Internet purchases or
radically restructuring state finances to wipe all sales taxes, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, governors want to retain the power to set sales
tax policy, he said. Currently, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is
pushing a plan to have Congress pre-empt states with a permanent
ban on taxes on Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   After a private meeting with most members of the Senate, the
governors emerged with no consensus on taxes. But a decision must
be made within two years or ``the opportunity will be lost'' amid
the frenzied growth of electronic commerce, Leavitt said.
</P>
<P>
   The governors' association is now backing away from its own
proposal, which recommended state governments create a ``trusted
third party'' to collect and remit sales taxes on Internet
purchases. During their meeting, the governors realized that any
plan creating another bureaucracy would not survive, Leavitt said.
</P>
<P>
   But the possibility of eliminating all sales taxes remains on
the table, he said. Such a change would be wrenching for the 45
states that now collect them. Sales taxes provide one-third to
one-half of revenues for most states and local governments, raising
more than $150 billion each year.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, states require brick-and-mortar retailers to collect
taxes on purchases. But online and mail-order merchants collect
taxes only from customers who live in the same state. ``Remote
sales,'' made to residents of states where the merchants have no
operations, generally escape taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Governors are worried about the shift to electronic commerce,
which now amounts to about $20 billion a year. If Internet sales
continue tripling every year as they have been, states will be
losing about $10.8 billion annually by 2003, according to a recent
study by the University of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The governors also discussed the problem Monday with President
Clinton, who urged them to move quickly. Otherwise, shoppers will
grow so accustomed to tax-free shopping on the Internet that
governors will find it politically impossible to begin imposing
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But while most governors want a uniform tax system that treats
all purchases alike, a few object, saying they don't want to
threaten the economy's ``golden goose.'' Gov. James Gilmore, R-Va.,
says the Internet's fantastic growth has created so many jobs in
his state that revenues from income and property taxes are soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes, D-Ga., left the gathering unpersuaded that
swift action, either by Congress or state legislatures, is
necessary because the Internet economy is still fragile. ``We don't
want to stop the growth of the Internet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NGA vice chairman Gov. Parris Glendening, D-Md., said that while
the sales tax question is unsettled, all governors agree Internet
access should not be taxed.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gilmore and Leavitt are among the 19 members of the
congressionally appointed Advisory Commission on Electronic
Commerce. That group, composed of federal, state, business and
consumer leaders, is studying the Internet tax question and is due
to send recommendations to Congress by April 21.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, a nationwide moratorium is in effect, blocking taxes
aimed specifically at the Internet until October 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is likely to extend that moratorium for perhaps two
years to allow more time for debate. Leavitt said most governors
would not object to such an extension.

 LEARNING TO COOK: Rich Bavarian Cream Garners Raves   By Marion Cunningham  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; If you learn to make this Bavarian Cream, you
really don't need many more dessert recipes. This dish gets raves
every time it's served.
<P>
   It can be designed to suit whatever season you wish. Serve it
with berries, soft stone fruits or _ my favorite _ a simple rich
butterscotch sauce.
</P>
<P>
   The sauce keeps indefinitely in a covered jar in the
refrigerator and it, too, has some versatility. Serve it over
poached pears or baked bananas, or just over a scoop of ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; BAVARIAN CREAM
</P>
<P>
   This gelatin-based custard must be made several hours before you
plan to serve it. It's great paired with cut-up fresh strawberries,
or a mixture of fruit _ or with a rich butterscotch sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 envelope unflavored gelatin
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup cold water
</P>
<P>
   4 egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons vanilla
</P>
<P>
   1 cup whipping cream
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Preparing the gelatin: &LR;  Sprinkle the gelatin over the cold
water; stir to blend. Set aside to soften for 5 minutes. (It won't
hurt to let it sit longer.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mixing the ingredients: &LR;  Put the yolks in a bowl and, using a
whisk or fork, stir briskly to blend. Slowly add the sugar and
continue to stir until well mixed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cooking the custard: &LR;  Pour the milk into a saucepan and place
over medium-high heat. Stand right by the stove and watch for tiny
milk bubbles to form around the edge of the pan. The milk should be
hot, but not boiling. It is better to underheat than to boil. As
long as the milk is hot it will work fine.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the yolk/sugar mixture into the hot milk, then add the
softened gelatin and stir with a large spoon or whisk to blend
well. Cook, stirring slowly, but constantly for 3 or 4 minutes.
Tilt the pan until you can see the bottom. If there is a thin coat
of custard on the bottom that doesn't flow as readily as the rest,
it's ready. Remove from heat. Do  &LR; not &LR;  let the custard boil; it
will be fine if you remove it too soon rather that too late.
</P>
<P>
   Stir in the vanilla. Pour the custard into a bowl and
refrigerate for 30 minutes, or just long enough for it to begin to
gel. It should be thick but pourable.
</P>
<P>
   This last step is the secret of a fabulous Bavarian Cream: Beat
the cream only until it holds soft peaks. If the cream is too
stiff, the dessert will be too firm. Fold the whipped cream into
the custard. Spoon into a 2-quart mold or bowl, cover with plastic
wrap or a lid and refrigerate several hours, to allow the dessert
to gel.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bavarian Cream is in a mold, turn it out onto a plate
before serving. Otherwise, spoon into dessert bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 5 or 6.

</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup heavy cream
</P>

Cook over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until the sauce is
melted and smoothly combined.
</P>
<P>
   Remove from heat and whisk a little to blend thoroughly. If it
seems a little thicker than desired, thin with a little milk.
</P>
<P>
   May be made ahead and stored in a covered jar in the

 TASTER'S CHOICE: It's Jar vs. Can in the Battle of the Bean   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Many recipes call for canned beans as a way of
cutting the time needed for cooking beans from scratch. But is
there a difference from brand to brand? According to The
Chronicle's tasting panel, there is.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's panel tasted eight different beans from cans and jars.
We included all beans labeled white beans, small white beans or
specific small varieties such as Great Northern. We did not include
larger cannellini beans. All were drained and rinsed but not
heated.
</P>
<P>
   The far-and-away favorite was  &UR; Whole Foods &LR;  (20.35-ounce jar,
$1.69 at Whole Foods). Panelists were particularly fond of the
beans' texture, and two noted the flavor. They also thought this
brand would work particularly well in soups or salads. All would
buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to  &UR; Annalisa &LR;  (12.3-ounce jar, 99 cents at
Tower Market). Most panelists liked the texture, although one
wanted the beans to be more firm. Most also liked the flavor.
Panelists recommended using this brand as a side dish to meat or
pureed into a bean dip. Two would buy it; three might buy it.
</P>
<P>
   The top canned variety was  &UR; S &AMP; W &LR;  (15 ounces, 95 cents-$1.19 at
many supermarkets). Four panelists detected a smoky flavor, which
one thought was overbearing. Another thought the beans tasted
chemical. One panelist liked the firm texture, but two others
though the beans were mushy. Two would buy it, one might buy it,
and two would not.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth place went to  &UR; Albertsons &LR;  (15 ounces, 69 cents at
Albertsons). Two panelists thought these beans tasted raw and
undercooked; two others detected a soapy aftertaste. But one
panelist liked the neutral flavor and thought it would blend well
with other ingredients. Three might buy it; two would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sun Vista &LR;  (15 ounces, 79 cents at Andronico's) came in fifth.
Panelists disliked the mushy texture, though some thought the
flavors were good. Two recommended this brand for a bean dip. Two
might buy it; three would not.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also tasted Westbrae Natural, Eden Organic and
ShariAnn's but they scored too low to rate.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Donna Katzl,
chef-owner, Cafe For All Seasons, San Francisco; Roland Passot,
chef-owner, La Folie in San Francisco and Left Bank in Larkspur and
Menlo Park; Kim Severson, Chronicle staff writer; and Kirk Webber,
chef-owner, Cafe Kati, San Francisco. All products are tasted

EDITORS NOTE: The Chronicle regularly features ``Best Way'', a
column in which the Food staff tries to establish the most reliable
way to cook many of our favorite foods.  BEST WAY: Cooking Long-Grain Rice  
   
 By Lynne Bennett  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  It sounds simple, but isn't _ what's the best way
to cook white, enriched, long-grain rice so it maintains its
distinct grains and is not sticky? We tested 15 batches of rice to
find out.
<TEXT>
<P>
   We started with six different cooking methods: simmering the
rice in a covered saucepan; boiling, then steaming it covered;
boiling it; baking it; using an electric rice cooker; and using a
plastic microwave rice cooker.
</P>
<P>
   We initially tested the ratio of 1 cup rice to 2 cups water,
seasoned with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt. This standard proportion _
found on most rice packages _ produced soft, sticky rice, which is
typical in many Asian dishes but was not what we were looking for.
</P>
<P>
   The proportion of 1 cup rice to 11/2 cups water worked better,
but 11/4 cups water proved best. To be sure, we retested the 1 cup
rice to 11/4 cups water ratio using a a different brand of
long-grain rice and got the same good results.
</P>
<P>
   Our next step was to try the six cooking methods with this
proportion, and found we liked the rice baked in a 350-degree oven
best. Runner-up was the traditional method of adding the rice to
boiling water then simmering it, covered, for 20 minutes. The rice
that was boiled and drained like pasta was very soft and rather
soggy although one Food staff member liked it because she grew up
eating rice that way.
</P>
<P>
   Both rice cooker methods were disappointing, turning out rice
that was dry and overly firm. We decided the Best Way water
measurement _ 11/4 cups _ needed to be increased for these two
cooking methods so we tested them again using 11/2 cups water for
the rice cooker and followed the microwave cooker recipe of 3/4 cup
rice to 11/3 cups water. We repeated the Best Way oven method with
11/4 cups water for comparison.
</P>
<P>
   This time, all three methods _ oven, electric rice cooker and
microwave cooker _ produced rice that was very good, with separate,
distinct grains that were thoroughly cooked but firm enough to
stand up to a dish like a seafood gumbo. Because it does not
require any special equipment, we favored the oven method.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; THE BEST WAY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place 1 cup of white,
long-grain rice and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt in a small, ovenproof
baking dish. Add 11/4 cups boiling water, stirring once to dissolve
the salt. Cover the dish first with heavy-duty plastic wrap and
then with aluminum foil, making sure the plastic is completely
covered by the foil. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until all the water
is absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the rice from the oven and allow it to rest for 5
minutes. Stir gently, then recover the dish loosely with the
plastic wrap and let the rice rest for 5 more minutes before
serving. Makes approximately 31/2 cups. (Note: To double the
amount, use 2 cups rice, 21/8 cups water and 1 teaspoon of kosher
salt.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; APPEALING ALTERNATIVES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The traditional method of simmering the rice in a covered
saucepan is tried and true, producing good results. If you have an
electric rice cooker or a plastic microwave rice cooker (which took
14 minutes), by all means use them, although they take more water
than the Best Way.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
When Life Gives You Rice... &QL; 
The inevitable outcome of testing 15 different batches of
long-grain white rice for today's Best Way column was finding a lot
of leftover rice in the refrigerator the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting to waste a single grain, I whipped up a batch of
fried rice for my Food Department colleagues. It wasn't just any
old fried rice, however. My version uses no oil or liquid other
than soy sauce and the natural moisture from the ingredients. It's
a great recipe, clean and light-tasting with no greasy aftertaste.
Each grain of rice is fluffy and separate.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a versatile recipe. I chose a combination of Chinese
sausage and ham as the meat, and used defrosted frozen peas as the
vegetable. But you can use whatever you like or have on hand. I
like to add a sprinkle of sesame seed oil right at the end. It adds
a little fat, but is worth it for the flavor and aroma it lends to
the dish.
</P>
<P>
   One trick to assure success is to use the rice straight from the
refrigerator, or let it come to room temperature. Do not reheat it
before adding it to the pan.

 AT THE SOURCE: St. George Cheese Is the Darling of Santa Rosa 
 Farm   By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SANTA ROSA, Calif. _  For Sylvia Tucker, cheesemaking is a hands-on
affair _ literally.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most days, she hand-mixes curds to make St. George cheese at Joe
Matos Cheese Co., her parents' farm and business outside Santa
Rosa, where 25 to 30 Holsteins graze in mooing distance of a small
factory and sales room.
</P>
<P>
   Jose and Mary Matos brought the cheese recipe with them from the
Azores islands, where his family had been making the traditional
cheese _ known as St. Jorge in Portuguese _ for the better part of
a century. The couple set up business in Sonoma County in 1979,
with Mary as the main cheesemaker.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, a young woman _ also from the Azores _ took over
the arduous job, and when she left a few years back, daughter
Sylvia stepped up to the plate (or the vat, as it were) to become
the fifth generation of cheesemakers in her family.
</P>
<P>
   This farmstead cheese is sometimes described as a cross between
Monterey jack and cheddar, but unlike the way cheddar is made, the
curds for St. George are not stacked and milled but rather turned
by hand until they have the right consistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long?'' Tucker answers a question. ``Hard to say. You just
develop a feel for it; you feel it when the consistency is right _
sort of like Jell-O.''
</P>
<P>
   After the whey is separated from the curds, it is placed in
hoops and pressed with homemade weights _ buckets of hardened
cement _ for 48 hours. Then the wheels of fresh cheese are dried
for two months or more; the flavor becomes more assertive the
longer the cheese is aged. During this time, the wheels of cheese
are ``turned and turned and turned,'' Tucker says, and they develop
distinctive rinds. They're completely edible _ ``no wax,'' Tucker
says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   She admits that the Matos' way of making cheese may be
old-fashioned, but believes that mechanically produced cheeses
don't have the character of a handmade cheese.
</P>
<P>
   St. George has a buttery, slightly nutty flavor that makes it a
perfect companion to a chunk of French bread and a glass of wine,
the cheesemaker says. Her family _ husband Steve and three
children, aged 5 to 11 _ also likes the cheese in quesadillas,
grilled sandwiches and, dried a little longer, grated over pasta.
</P>
<P>
   And it makes a mean mac and cheese.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Joe Matos Cheese Co.'s St. George cheese is available at &LR; 
 &LR; Cowgirl Creamery in Pt. Reyes Station, Artisan Cheese in San &LR; 
 &LR; Francisco, Cheeseboard in Berkeley and Oakville Grocery stores &LR; 
 &LR; throughout the Bay Area, for $9-$13 per pound. The cheese is &LR; 
 &LR; also sold at the farm at 3669 Llano Road (off Highway 12), &LR;   &LR; Santa
Rosa (off Highway 12), from 9 a.m.-5 p.m. daily for $4.50 &LR;   &LR; a
pound. Call the farm at (707) 584-5283 for more &LR;   &LR; information.cq &LR;

 Beating the Blahs: How chefs put pizzazz in their
dead-of-winter  menus   By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  You might call this the awkward season _ it's
March, which means that spring is not too far off, at the same time
it's still the dead of winter. Produce bins, by and large, yield
little excitement, so we are challenged to put pizzazz into our
menus.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's make ``challenge'' the operational word. After all, it's
easy to make meals sparkle when luscious stone fruit and berries,
plump tomatoes and tiny new potatoes fairly tumble into our market
baskets. This time of year, when the winter vegetables _ the hard
squashes, the sturdy cabbages, the rutabagas and all their root
cousins _ have lost their blustery-weather appeal, it takes
imagination to circumnavigate the dining doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   We asked some of the Bay Area's most imaginative restaurant
chefs how they punch up their menus. They all agreed that right now
_ mid-February to mid-March _ is a hard time for menu planning. Not
surprisingly, these also are the months that restaurants are the
emptiest, according to the National Restaurant Association _ an
added incentive for chefs to give their clients something to talk
about and to entice them to come back.
</P>
<P>
   Home cooks can take a leaf from the pros' strategy books for
keeping things lively on the stove.
</P>
<P>
   So what do chefs reach for in this difficult time? Many stick
with the ``local and seasonal'' mantra. Roland Passot of La Folie
and Left Bank restaurants still makes his weekly pilgrimage to the
Saturday morning Ferry Plaza Farmers' Market. There is plenty of
interesting food that is in season, he maintains _ all the
varieties of citrus fruit, from blood oranges to grapefruit and
tangerines (the latter might add vibrancy to a scallop dish); good
carrots, Belgian endive (braised for a salad or the base for those
tangerine-accented scallops) and mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Passot gets a steady supply of ``lovely little haricot vert''
from San Diego, somewhat of a luxury item, but he also sings the
praises of prosaic all-American green celery, which he blanches
briefly in salted water, then braises with a few spoons of chicken
stock and a little lump of butter. He also turns the celery into a
gratin dish, adding a bit more stock and topping it with a grating
of Parmesan and Gruy &LR; e &LR; re. After a few minutes under the broiler to
melt the cheeses, it's a fine side dish _ ``very simple, very
inexpensive,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   There is a good chance that while shopping at Ferry Plaza,
Passot might run into Rose Pistola's Eric Cosselmon, who thinks
that here in California we always can find great produce as long as
we are willing to experiment. Cosselmon, as well as the other chefs
interviewed, does not try to cheat Mother Nature by buying imported
out-of-season produce, with the exception of early asparagus and
tropical fruit from Mexico. Those, he asserts, are natural crops of
their regions, not specifically raised _ and possibly forced _ for
the export trade.
</P>
<P>
   For extra variety, Cosselmon browses the Alemany Farmers'
Market, ``with its wonderful ethnic mix.'' Here he buys items such
as fresh shallots grown by Vietnamese farmers; and green garlic, a
Korean specialty that ``can really wake up your palate,'' like when
he chops and sprinkles it over thinly sliced fried zucchini chips.
</P>
<P>
   He also enlivens his menu with meats that are popular in Europe
_ tripe, tongue and brains _ but viewed with trepidation by many
American diners. ``We make a terrific calf brain antipasto,'' he
says. ``People who like it love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Denham also uses the late winter lull to entice
all-American meat-and-potato eaters into lesser-known territory at
his restaurant, 42 Degrees. Appetizers include Iberian blood
sausage with piquillo peppers, and rich, garlic-accented roasted
marrow bones.
</P>
<P>
   Denham bridges the seasonal gap by using lots of onions _ in one
dish, three different ways: roasted onion risotto finished with
Madeira-laced red onion jam and honey-rosemary glazed cipollini
onions.
</P>
<P>
   Winter herbs, he finds, are custom-made for punching up dishes.
A fragrant Calabrese sausage served over pasta marries lamb with
mint, parsley and rosemary in addition to garlic and shallots.
Gremolata, the Mediterranean mix of minced parsley, garlic and
lemon zest, adds a delightful fresh note to veal osso buco.
</P>
<P>
   Meat figures large in the current menu of Montage chef Jennifer
Cox as well. This season she tends to make meat portions a bit
bigger than the rest of the year. ``I concentrate on protein,'' she
says. She often forgoes the standard trio of meat, vegetable and
starch on the plate, instead presenting just two elements. Nor does
she adhere to the school that dictates every serving must be
colorful. Cox sees nothing wrong with a monochromatic plate, such
as a steak served with a potato-leek gratin. One of her more
brightly colored plates _ seared scallops on a bed of greens, with
coinlike golden kumquat slices and wine-poached dried cranberries
and a Meyer lemon vinaigrette _ features that combination not so
much because it looks pretty (it does), but because the seasonal
flavors enhance one another.
</P>
<P>
   If Cox had her druthers, no tomato would be seen in her kitchen
until the first local fruit appears, but being in a tourist
destination (Montage is in the Sony Metreon complex), she puts the
obligatory slice of tomato on lunchtime hamburgers.
</P>
<P>
   The season's comparatively limited produce choices might be
expected to hit hardest in a restaurant that doesn't serve meat or
seafood, but Annie Somerville of Green's, San Francisco's
award-winning vegetarian restaurant, is undaunted. She uses capers,
nuts, croutons, dried fruit, olives and good cheeses to add zest to
her dishes.
</P>
<P>
   A compote of quince and dried cranberries sparks creme
fraiche-anointed griddle cakes of yams and Yellow Fin potatoes. Her
current favorite salad pairs hearts of romaine lettuce with mizuna
and arugula (all in good supply), adds quartered eggs and chunky
sourdough croutons and dresses it all in a champagne-caper
vinaigrette. Another salad combines wilted red and white cabbage
with Sierra Beauty apples, goat cheese and walnuts, with an apple
juice and balsamic vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   Early asparagus and citrus are on Somerville's menu, with the
two sometimes playing off each other, as in an asparagus soup
swirled with creme fraiche mixed with orange juice and zest.
</P>
<P>
   Citrus fruit in all its variety comes up again and again when
chefs talk about punching up their between-season menus.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Birnbaum, the New Orleans-born chef of Catahoula in
Calistoga and Sazerac in Seattle, says citrus has a great affinity
for chile peppers _ a fire and sunshine combination.
</P>
<P>
   If he needs inspiration, says Birnbaum _ another adherent of the
local-and-seasonal school _ ``I go to the dry store room.'' Such a
trip results in creations like his much-ordered Beans That Make You
Crazy, a cassouletlike dish that can feature any number of meats,
including duck confit.
</P>
<P>
   And in a pinch, Birnbaum says, you can't go wrong with potatoes,
citing favorites such as his version of a potato latke with salmon;
flavored mashed potatoes; and scalloped potatoes that get a quick
trip into the brick oven for a hit of smokiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brain is stuck on default when it come to potatoes,'' he
admits with a chuckle _ and that goes double this time of year.

<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Drain the beans, discarding the water. Season the pork or lamb
and duck with about a third of the spice mix. Heat the oil in a
large, heavy pot and sear the meat cubes, duck and sausages in it
until lightly browned. Remove and reserve. Add the bacon and cook
until the fat is rendered.
</P>
<P>
   Add the onion, garlic and jalapeno; cook over medium heat until
the onion begins to caramelize. Add the beans and stir to coat. Add
the molasses and cook 5 minutes. Add the red pepper flakes and
tomatoes and cook 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the stock and bring to a simmer. Add the meat cubes and duck
legs, reserving the sausages for later. Add part or all of the
remaining spice mix (using all the mix will give you a red-hot
dish). Cover and place in the oven; cook until the beans and meats
are tender, about 1 to 11/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Add the sausages and vinegar; taste and season with salt, if
necessary. Cover with a thin layer of breadcrumbs and return to the

   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   11/2 pounds assorted wild mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   1 pound Yellow Finn potatoes
</P>
<P>
   2 extra-large eggs
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces grated pecorino cheese
</P>
<P>
   Leaves from 3 thyme sprigs, chopped
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Pastry for a double-crust, 9-inch pie
</P>
<P>
   Egg wash: 1 egg beaten with 1 teaspoon water
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Clean the mushrooms, chop them and dry-roast in a cast-iron or
other heavy skillet.
</P>
<P>
   Thinly slice the potatoes, then blanch in boiling salted water
until barely tender; drain.
</P>
<P>
   Mix together the 2 eggs, cream and cheese and season with the
thyme, salt and pepper. Fold in the mushrooms and potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Roll out slightly more than half of the pastry and line a 9-inch
pie pan with it. Trim off pastry even with rim of pan. Line with
wax paper and fill with pie weights or dry beans. Bake until the
dough is golden. Remove the weights and paper and spoon the filling
into the shell.
</P>
<P>
   Increase oven heat to 375 degrees. Roll out the remaining
pastry. Carefully transfer to top of tart; trim to 1 inch from rim
of pan, then crimp, tucking cut edge under to make a decorative
border around perimeter of tart. Cut a couple of steam vents in the
pastry. Brush the egg wash over the top. Bake until the tart puffs
up and is deep golden, about 25 minutes.

   MINDSPRING-MCQUARY _ Before the merger between MindSpring
Enterprises and EarthLink Network, Mike McQuary was happy to be the
force behind the scenes and let the company's charismatic founder
Charles Brewer take center stage. But McQuary, or ``McQ'' as he's
known to friends and associates is a strong personality in his own
right. In his new role as president of EarthLink McQuary will be a
much more visible presence than he has been to date. A Q&AMP;A session
with him. (Katz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25. WITH PHOTO.

   DOW _ Blue-chip stocks have declined sharply so far this year,
after stellar gains in recent years. Now, investors are bargain
hunting, which led to Monday's recovery in many blue-chip issues.
Among those investors buying is Atlanta money manager James
Barksdale, who considers himself a ``value'' investor. Barksdale
discusses the current market environment and his strategies for
``buying on dips.''

   HERRING _ ATLANTA _ They came, they saw, the scrounged for cash.
And there was lots of it floating around, chasing the Next New New
Thing.... The Red Herring brought more than 700 people to the
Ritz-Carlton to hear quickie presentations from 44 companies that
each have plans to be huge. Each can cite a mega-billion market
opportunity and each has a killer approach. But what is new, here?
What do the entrepreneurs have to say? And where is the money
going? What are the deep pockets looking for? And what does all
this say about Atlanta, the Southeast, and the nation's tech trends
_ just where are we heading?

   &UR; SCALIA CONTEMPLATES CHANGING JOBS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Court Justice  &UR; Antonin Scalia &LR; 's been depressed, says
Washingtonian magazine, because he can't seem to get his fellow
justices to allow states to set abortion rules. Conservatives
 &UR; William Rehnquist &LR;  and  &UR; Anthony Kennedy &LR;  have been disappointments
to Scalia; only  &UR; Clarence Thomas &LR;  is a proven ally.
</P>
<P>
   According to the magazine, Scalia is waiting for the outcome of
the presidential election to decide on his future.
</P>
<P>
   If a Democrat wins, he's unlikely to ever been &LR;  made chief
justice, and he will probably resign. If a Republican wins, there's
a chance that Scalia or Thomas will be appointed chief justice when
Rehnquist retires. Scalia will stay on, hoping that happens.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine notes, too, that the New York law firm Davis Polk &AMP;
Wardwell is paying first-year associates right out of law school
$150,000 to $160,000 a year. Scalia's salary on the court is only
$167,900 a year, another motivation for him to change jobs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ON THE WAY TO THE PRESIDENCY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Questioned by the Republican pollster  &UR; Frank Luntz &LR; , whose
survey is reported on the political Web site YROCK.com _ YROCK is
Young Republican Online Community Network _ GOP women named
 &UR; George W. Bush &LR;  the best prospective spouse among the presidential
hopefuls, men picked him as the best best man and people of both
genders were in agreement that he was most likely to have cheated
in college.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; John McCain &LR;  got top ranking as preferred father and landlord,
and babysitter for a 16-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Al Gore &LR;  was selected as preferred lifeline for voters if they
were to appear on ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' He was also
chosen as probably the worst to listen to at a karaoke bar.
</P>
<P>
   P.S.  &UR; Joe Shea &LR;  of the American Reporter says McCain was seen
chewing ice while making chitchat with supporters at a Los Angeles
fund-raiser. And  &UR; Bill Bradley &LR; 's campaign has issued a press
release saying the candidate was holding a series of ``visibilities
at key locations'' in Maryland Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MOO AND BOO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the National Milk Producers Federation's campaign to
banish the term ``soy milk,''  &UR; Michael Babcock &LR;  stirs up some other
cauldrons:
</P>
<P>
   ``How about jelly beans?'' he writes. ``Just the other day, I
bought a batch to make some chile con carne, and you can believe it
turned out lousy! Why, it's neither jelly nor bean.'' Furthermore,
he asks, ``Ever tried to drink baking soda?''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, travel writer  &UR; Carole Terwilliger Meyers &LR;  wonders why
the group isn't complaining about coconut milk. ``Is that because
they think it lactates from breasts, because women have been
observed wearing coconut shells over same?''
</P>
<P>
   Meyers, a woman with the tropics on her mind, will be part of a
``Travelers' Tales Hawaii'' reading tonight at Get Lost Travel in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - At a premiere party in New York for the movie ``Judy Berlin,''
director  &UR; Whit Stillman &LR;  told Personals spy  &UR; Baird Jones &LR;  that he's
just finished writing a script, with  &UR; George Plimpton &LR; , ``about the
early days of the Paris Review when  &UR; Jane Fonda &LR;  and all these
college girls came over to Paris to help start up the literary
magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Linda Denizard &LR; , chef at a Miami restaurant owned by  &UR; Ricky &LR; 
 &UR; Martin &LR; , is trying to find a publisher for a Ricky Martin cookbook,
which will include her recipes and his introduction. The New York
Daily News says this is expected to get an advance in the (large)
$500,000-to-$1 million range.
</P>
<P>
   - Conceptual artist  &UR; Lawrence Weiner &LR;  has two Manhattan
installations _ including one at the Dia Art Foundation Center _ in
which he has relabeled the men's and ladies' rooms, &LR;  Us and Them.
Because the Dia Foundation is incorporated as a nonprofit group,
some picky art lovers are wondering if the labels are
discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   - One of the third-place winners in the Good Vibrations
Millennium Sex Toys contest is a device activated by pager (not to
be more fully described in a family newspaper).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe she can be a Martha Stewart for girls.''
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Adrienne Fontanella &LR; , president of the Barbie division of
Mattel, telling the Wall Street Journal that she hopes a new Barbie
_ with belly button, bigger hips and  &LR; a  &LR; smaller bust -will help
sell all kinds of products.

   MINDSPRING-MCQUARY _ Before the merger between MindSpring
Enterprises and EarthLink Network, Mike McQuary was happy to be the
force behind the scenes and let the company's charismatic founder
Charles Brewer take center stage. But McQuary, or ``McQ'' as he's
known to friends and associates is a strong personality in his own
right. In his new role as president of EarthLink McQuary will be a
much more visible presence than he has been to date. A Q&AMP;A session

   DOW _ Blue-chip stocks have declined sharply so far this year,
after stellar gains in recent years. Now, investors are bargain
hunting, which led to Monday's recovery in many blue-chip issues.
Among those investors buying is Atlanta money manager James
Barksdale, who considers himself a ``value'' investor. Barksdale
discusses the current market environment and his strategies for
``buying on dips.''

   HERRING _ ATLANTA _ They came, they saw, the scrounged for cash.
And there was lots of it floating around, chasing the Next New New
Thing.... The Red Herring brought more than 700 people to the
Ritz-Carlton to hear quickie presentations from 44 companies that
each have plans to be huge. Each can cite a mega-billion market
opportunity and each has a killer approach. But what is new, here?
What do the entrepreneurs have to say? And where is the money
going? What are the deep pockets looking for? And what does all
this say about Atlanta, the Southeast, and the nation's tech trends
_ just where are we heading?

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Decision day arrives in 3 states
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush was expected to beat John McCain in the Virginia
primary and North Dakota caucuses Tuesday, but was in a close
primary race in Washington state. The three contests were not
expected to settle much in the bitter fight between the two unless
Bush loses Virginia _ a potentially fatal blow to his campaign. But
the three contests could set the tone for next week's Super Tuesday
on March 7, when voters in 12 states, including New York,
California and Ohio, hold Republican primaries or caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE THE DELEGATES ARE _ AND AREN'T
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia Republican primary on Tuesday, also open to
Democrats and independents, has 56 delegates at stake, winner take
all. The North Dakota GOP caucuses have 19 delegates at stake,
awarded proportionally. The GOP primary in Washington state, open
to Democrats and independents, has 37 delegates at stake, 12 to be
awarded to today's top vote-getter and 25 at caucuses on March 7.
Washington state's Democratic primary is a nonbinding ``beauty
contest,'' with no delegates at stake.
</P>
<P>
   DEBATE REVERSAL, OF SORTS
</P>
<P>
   It looks like there could be a debate after all between John
McCain and George W. Bush in advance of next week's big round of
Super Tuesday primaries. McCain had canceled plans to take part in
Thursday's debate in Los Angeles, but he reversed himself Tuesday
and said he would debate Bush before next week's California primary
if he can do it by live satellite feed. McCain said he was willing
to change his campaign schedule in New York to appear. He also
offered to debate Bush on Wednesday via satellite on MSNBC's
``Hardball,'' or in person Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
Thursday's debate, to be telecast nationally on CNN, will also
include Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   WHY PULL OUT TO BEGIN WITH? 'TIS A MYSTERY
</P>
<P>
   To Californians, it was all a little baffling. Why would John
McCain pull out of the only Republican debate scheduled in the
nation's largest state the week before the highest-stakes primary
on the political calendar? McCain's decision to withdraw from the
forum Thursday in Los Angeles, citing scheduling conflicts, took
everyone by surprise, including the debate's sponsors, CNN and the
Los Angeles Times. It also caused dissension in McCain's own
campaign: His communications director, Daniel Schnur, was quoted as
saying that the withdrawal was ``definitely a mistake'' and ``a
tactical error at the staff level.''
</P>
<P>
   REGRET AT HOLDING TONGUE
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush expressed regret Tuesday for not speaking up
sooner against anti-Catholic bias. He says he should have done so
when he spoke at Bob Jones University in Greenville, S.C., which
has harbored anti-Catholic sentiment. Bush said he felt ``things
are coming my way'' as voters cast ballots in GOP primaries Tuesday
in Virginia and Washington state and in North Dakota's caucuses.
Bush made plans to appear via satellite on David Letterman's
late-night talk show tonight. Tuesday, he met with Catholic
Charities workers in the half-finished Fatima Family Center, which
will offer social services in Cleveland's impoverished Hough
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   SOME UNEASINESS, BUT STILL BEHIND MCCAIN
</P>
<P>
   Conservative activist Gary Bauer, who endorsed John McCain after
dropping his own presidential bid, said Tuesday the senator's
remarks reflected a ``very personal'' dispute between McCain and
Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell. Bauer said McCain went too far by
comparing the two Christian leaders to ``fringe'' leaders on the
left, but urged conservative voters to support McCain as the
candidate more strongly opposed to abortion and same-sex marriage.
``Politics is an uncomfortable business,'' Bauer said on NBC's
``Today.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE HEART THAN VOTES
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley's presidential campaign stopped in San Francisco on
Tuesday, but left its heart in Washington state, where he hoped
voters would give him a desperately needed boost. Though no
delegates were at stake in Washington _ they will be assigned at
statewide party caucuses next Tuesday _ the Democratic ``beauty
contest'' was important for Bradley after Al Gore defeated him in
Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   END OF THE ROAD IN PACIFIC NORTHWEST?
</P>
<P>
   The National Journal's Political Hotline, citing an anonymous
high-level official in Bill Bradley's campaign, reports that
Bradley will drop out of the presidential race today if he doesn't
win Washington state. Barring that, Bradley is slated to debate Al
Gore in Los Angeles tonight, then take a red-eye to New York, where
polls give him a better shot at notching a significant win March 7.
</P>
<P>
   APPEALING TO LATINOS
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore was in California on Tuesday, addressing a Hispanic
event in Los Angeles and headlining two fund-raisers. Speaking at a
local community center in Cudahy, where nine out of 10 residents is
Latino, Gore called education and health care key to expanding
economic prosperity throughout the Latino community. Gore noted
that over the past seven years, incomes for Latino families have
risen, Latino homeownership has increased, and the Latino
unemployment rate has reached its lowest level in history. But, he
said, more must be done.
</P>
<P>
   WIN THE BATTLE, LOSE THE WAR?
</P>
<P>
   Polls show John McCain tied with George W. Bush in California's
popular vote, but well behind among the Republicans whose votes are
the only ones that count toward choosing California delegates.
McCain said if he wins the overall vote but loses the delegate
race, the Republican Party will have to decide, ``Do they want
somebody who wins the majority or do they want somebody who wins
only Republican votes?''
</P>
<P>
   THE LAST WEEK _ DECISION TIME
</P>
<P>
   Polls in California also show a lopsided Democratic contest,
with Al Gore far ahead. But Bill Bradley insisted, ``Californians
make their decision in the last week. There's no question about
that.'' Bradley and his aides also were completing work on an
unusual, five-minute TV ad to be broadcast Thursday at 10:55 p.m.
PST across the country on CBS. ``It's Bradley speaking personally
to voters about his vision for the country and the basis of his
candidacy and why he would be a better president,'' spokesman Eric
Hauser said. The campaign did not reveal the cost of the ad.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO CUT THROUGH MANAGED CARE
</P>
<P>
   Aetna U.S. Healthcare has decided to continue skilled nursing
care for a baby whose case caught Al Gore's attention. The
company's chief medical officer, Dr. Arthur Leibowitz, said
evaluation of Ian Malone's case was sped up due to Gore's interest.
The baby, now about 5 months old, has brain damage caused by a
difficult birth. He suffers seizures, can't swallow and is prone to
choking. The 12-hour-a-day, in-home nursing care costs about $300 a
day, the Malones said. A reviewer had recommended that nursing care
be terminated and that the family care for the infant full-time.
Leibowitz said the final decision to continue nursing help would
have been made even if the case had not become a presidential
campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   HE'S THE FIREFIGHTER WIELDING THE HOSE
</P>
<P>
   Declaring that ``politics isn't about votes only,'' Alan Keyes
said he won't drop out of the GOP race because he is calling
attention to moral problems in the country. ``I'm not giving up. I
won't give up; America's moral house is on fire,'' he said. In a
speech at Syracuse University, Keyes said George W. Bush hasn't got
a chance to win the presidency. He said Republicans won't win on
economic grounds, because the national economy is strong under
President Clinton's administration.

   Le Grand Vefour in Paris, the newest three-star restaurant in
the Michelin firmament, is hardly new at all. The restaurant,
anointed in the latest Michelin guide to France, which was
published on Monday, is a piece of the city's history.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked into an arcade in the back of the Palais Royal gardens,
it began in 1784 as the Cafe de Chartres. Jean Vefour bought it and
renamed it in 1820. It is now one of seven Michelin three-star
restaurants in Paris. The others are Taillevent, Alain Ducasse,
Arpege, Pierre Gagnaire, L'Ambroisie and Lucas Carton.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Paris, France has 15 three-star restaurants. Seventy
restaurants in this year's guide have two stars, and 410 have one.
The Michelin inspectors visit the restaurants anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   In the rest of the latest Michelin lineup, another venerable
stop, -L'Espadon at the Ritz in Paris, was demoted from two stars
to one, and the Regence in the Plaza Athenee climbed from one to
two.
</P>
<P>
   Helene Darroze, one of 16 women who have earned Michelin stars
as chefs, moved her one-star restaurant from Villeneuve-de-Marsan
in the southwest of France to Paris last fall and retained her
rating.
</P>
<P>
   Alain Ducasse, who has earned three stars at two restaurants
(Louis XV in Monte Carlo and Alain Ducasse), won a star for his new
place, Bar et Boeuf, also in Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   This year's guide is the 100th anniversary edition. The French
edition, now known simply as Le Guide Rouge (The Red Guide), has
added brief descriptions of all establishments. Those who buy it in
France will receive a bonus, a facsimile edition of the original,
from 1900.
</P>
<P>
   The international edition, sold in the United States ($26) does
not include this bit of nostalgia, but 116 of the 5,661 hotels in
the guide have been marked with a ``100'' to show that they were in
the orginal guide. Michelin began evaluating restaurants in 1920.
The star system was inaugurated in 1926. The guide has a Web site,
www.Michelin-travel.com, which will provide the guide free until
June 30.
</P>
<P>
   As for Le Grand Vefour, it became a famous gathering place for
intellectuals, including Victor Hugo, Georges Sand and, more
recently, Jean Cocteau and Colette, whose favorite burgundy
banquettes bear their names on brass plates.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant's popularity declined after World War I. In 1948,
Louis Vaudable, the owner of Maxim's, bought it and turned the
kitchen over to Raymond Oliver, who eventually became the
restaurant's owner. It earned three Michelin stars, a rating it
maintained until 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The Taittinger Champagne family bought it in 1984, restored its
glorious 19th-century landmark interior and in 1991, after false
starts with other chefs, hired Guy Martin, a native of the Savoy
region. He had earned two Michelin stars at the Chateau de Divonne
in Divonne-les-Bains in the French Alps.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 43, skillfully orchestrates tradition and innovation in
such dishes as pigeon in a sauce thickened with blood, creamy foie
gras ravioli and desserts made with candied fennel. His cart of
farmhouse cheeses from Savoy is unsurpassed.
</P>
<P>
   Le Grand Vefour, at 17, rue Beaujolais, is open Monday through
Friday for lunch and dinner. In addition to an a la carte menu, it
offers a 390-franc menu (about $58) at lunch. The phone number is
(011) 33-1-42-96-56-27.

BRITISH LIST 350 WORKS NAZIS MAY HAVE HELD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Germany, France, Belgium, Britain)   By SARAH LYALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ After combing through their holdings, Britain's art
museums and galleries released a list of more than 350 works of art
Tuesday that have murky provenances for the period around World War
II and may have been seized by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   The list was drawn from 10 major institutions across Britain,
including the Tate Gallery, the National Gallery and the Victoria
and Albert Museum, and it includes paintings by van Gogh, Picasso,
Renoir, Munch and Matisse. Among them are Delacroix's ``Christ on
the Cross,'' which is part of the National Gallery's collection;
Cezanne's ``Avenue at the Jas de Bouffan,'' which is held by the
Tate Gallery; and a still life by Diego Rivera, which is also held
by the Tate.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Nicholas Serota, the chairman of the National Museum
Directors' Conference, which prepared the report, said that there
was no factual evidence that any of the works had been stolen by
the Nazis before the works found their way to Britain after the
war. But he said the institutions involved were eager to solve the
mystery of where the pieces had been and who had owned them from
1933 to 1945, when the Nazis helped themselves to the best art in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to share this information with our colleagues,
nationally and internationally,'' said Serota, announcing at a news
conference that the list would also be posted on the Internet. ``We
need assistance to reduce the list of works around which there is
some question.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We are very much more ready than we have been to
deal with any claims or requests for information.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain is the latest European country to make an official
effort to restore artworks stolen by the Nazis to their rightful
owners. Critics point out that in many countries restitution or
compensation has been hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, for instance, the French government identified
nearly 1,000 paintings, drawings and sculptures that had been
appropriated by Nazi occupation forces and returned to France after
the war but had not been claimed by the original owners' families
or estates. But only a handful of these works were ever returned to
their owners, although the government posted details on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that this is passive research _ this is not
research at all,'' said Hector Feliciano, an expert on Nazi looting
and the author of ``The Lost Museum,'' published in English in
1997. ``You really can't wait for people to come to the Internet
and claim their Picassos or whatever. You have to be active and try
to compensate for the 60 years in which the paintings have been
lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Elan Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish Congress,
which is based in New York, said he welcomed the British move as a
``very forward-looking initial step.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that the museums should make aggressive efforts to
identify owners and return the works to their heirs or estates.
``The fact that they have identified 350 has to be regarded in
itself as a positive step,'' he said. ``But the proof of the
pudding is in the tasting.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Steinberg also chastised the United States,
saying it lagged behind Europe in this area. ``I wish the American
museums had come this far,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago American art museums promised to make inventories
of their holdings and identify suspect works, but so far there has
been no comprehensive listing of pieces that might have been stolen
by the Nazis and are now held by American museums. Although several
American museums have grudgingly relinquished works identified by
outsiders as having been stolen, Steinberg said, ``to this day no
museum has yet identified a single work of art in their holdings
which they have announced they were turning over.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Page, the chief legal officer for the Tate Gallery,
acknowledged that it would be virtually impossible to establish
beyond a doubt where each piece on the list of suspect works in
British museums had been during World War II. ``I think the
likelihood is that there may well remain a number of gaps in the
provenance of many of these works that we will never be able to
completely close,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a variety of reasons works of art have gaps in their
provenance,'' she explained. ``A lot of records were lost during
the war. Dealers and galleries were bombed and destroyed. People
had to move out very quickly and things were not taken with them.
Keeping their files in a spic-and-span state probably wasn't their
No. 1 priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, she said, record-keeping in the art world was much less
stringent 60 years ago than it is now. ``Transactions in works of
art were carried out in a relatively informal way,'' she said. ``It
was done often by people who knew each other and had been dealing
with each other for years. Contracts and letters that you might
expect to find in other transactions you wouldn't find in art
transactions. Things didn't have the enormous monetary values that
they have now.''
</P>
<P>
   Lord Janner, chairman of the Holocaust Educational Trust,
Britain's largest Jewish organization, said that only one claim had
been made against a work in a British museum. An elderly, infirm
Jewish man who moved from Germany to England before the war says
that a 1710 painting of Hampton Court Palace by the Dutch artist
Jan Griffier the Elder, now in the Tate Gallery, was owned by his
parents.
</P>
<P>
   The man's father, a banker, was killed by the Nazis in 1937, and
his mother fled to Belgium with their art collection. She then had
to sell the Griffier and other paintings to buy food, the claim
says, and was sent to a concentration camp for the rest of the war.
She survived and moved to England, dying in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   The government is establishing an advisory panel to consider
this claim and future ones. Janner said at the news conference that
rapid government action was important. ``This is a moral issue on a
major scale,'' he said.

TV NOTES: ABC'S RATINGS SWEEP; LETTERMAN AND CAMPAIGN 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABC Sweeps The Sweeps  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How much difference is ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' making
for ABC? The latest evidence: the game show pushed ABC to its first
victory in the February ratings sweep in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the sweep does not end until Wednesday night, ABC's
victory was across the board in every significant category, and
every other network conceded the sweep title to ABC.
</P>
<P>
   They all credited it to ``Millionaire,'' of course, pointing out
that ABC filled an enormous portion of its prime-time schedule, 18
percent in total, with 16 hours of ``Millionaire.'' Several of
those hours were added to the schedule late, when NBC was making a
run at nosing out ABC.
</P>
<P>
   NBC most pointedly suggested that ABC might be risking
overexposure with the series. But Lloyd Braun, the co-chairman of
ABC Entertainment, noted that the show had improved on its already
overwhelming performance in the November sweep by 18 percent. That
has convinced ABC that the show has not reached the saturation
point.
</P>
<P>
   But Preston Beckman, the executive vice president for
programming at NBC, pointed out that NBC began to beat ABC in
February when ABC used only three ``Millionaire'' shows a week.
``Now it takes four a week to win,'' Beckman said.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from ABC, NBC and CBS all pointed to what they said
was the best trend in February: stronger overall performance by
network television. Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS
Television, said the combined rating for the three biggest networks
rose for the first time since February 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, whose ratings declined about 9 percent in February, was not
included. Fox suffers the most from ``Millionaire'' because the
game show never plays after 10 p.m.; NBC and CBS have programming
after 10, but Fox does not.
</P>
<P>
   NBC emphasized the strong performance of many of its hit series,
including ``ER,'' which had its best rating in three years; the
venerable ``Law and Order,'' which was up 20 percent from February
last year; and ``Frasier,'' which NBC noted had improved every week
of the month even though it faced ``Millionaire'' every time.
</P>
<P>
   NBC executives also emphasized that their 10 p.m. shows
dominated the competition, an important point because the sweep
programming is intended to help local stations and especially their
late news programs.
</P>
<P>
   CBS made the point that it was the only network whose median age
declined in February, though its audience remained by far the
oldest of any network. Moonves said CBS's median age dropped to 52
from 53, while NBC climbed to 45 from 42 and ABC rose to 44 from
41.
</P>
<P>
   NBC executives said their new dramas, like ``The West Wing'' and
``Special Victims Unit,'' were pulling in slightly older viewers,
though they noted that those viewers also tended to be
well-educated and rich, two factors that NBC intends to pitch
heavily to advertisers who are unhappy that it is drawing an older
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ABC executives cited the horde that ``Millionaire'' is pulling
in as one reason for the rise in age.
</P>
<P>
   Letterman and Politics
</P>
<P>
   David Letterman continues his convalescence _ and that includes
the ratings kind _ Wednesday night when he tries to extend his
participation in the political campaign by bringing on George W.
Bush as part of a running ``Campaign 2000'' comedy bit.
</P>
<P>
   Bush became Letterman's target of opportunity after his show
scored a ratings coup with Hillary Rodham Clinton the same week in
January that he went into the hospital for emergency heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Since the surgery, Letterman has been welcomed back by
much-higher-than-normal ratings, though they have clearly started
to retreat since their high on Feb. 21, his first night back.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Letterman scored a rare victory over Jay Leno and the
``Tonight'' show, even though his ``Late Show'' on CBS used two
guest hosts on the nights Letterman took off. Both Bill Cosby and
Kathie Lee Gifford posted strong ratings for their guest-host
shows.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of bringing Bush on as the next political guest began
the night after Clinton's appearance, when Letterman started
pressing his executive producer, Rob Burnett, on the air to book
Bush. After the five-week hiatus for the surgery, Letterman took up
the call for Bush again in between comments describing the Texas
governor as a ``likely pinhead.''
</P>
<P>
   That apparently did not deter Bush's advisers, who, Burnett said
Tuesday, were eager to have him appear with Letterman. Bush is, of
course, busy trying to fend off Sen. John McCain, so he will appear
with Letterman on Wednesday night via satellite from St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was almost too easy to book,'' Burnett said. ``I called and
they said yes. This is one of those happy examples where we use
them and they use us.''
</P>
<P>
   The example has not been lost on McCain, whose representatives
were on the phone with Burnett on Tuesday looking to squeeze in an
appearance with Letterman before next Super Tuesday primaries in
New York, California and elsewhere. McCain had a problem, though.
He was planning to tape a show with Letterman in New York on
Thursday but then decided at the last minute to re-enter the CNN
debate scheduled for Thursday in California.
</P>
<P>
   That means he may be able to tape an appearance with Letterman
only on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But he has been busy on late night anyway: Bush will have
competition for late-night viewers Wednesday night because McCain
will be on with Leno. And if McCain manages to appear on
Letterman's show Monday, he'll have competition from Bush sitting
next to Leno.
</P>
<P>
   As Burnett put it: ``This is really no different from show
business. We're media and these guys need media.''

WARM, FUZZY _ AND POLITICAL _ `THE NEXT BEST THING'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If ``The Next Best Thing'' doesn't cause controversy, there's
something wrong.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it focuses on a child custody battle that will
naturally make viewers take sides. And one of the participants is a
homosexual, played by the openly gay actor Rupert Everett, who does
not conform to the sexless, effeminate stereotype that Hollywood
movies find comfortable. The other main character is played by
Everett's longtime friend Madonna, whose every move seems to stir
debate _ even more so when it involves the pop star's
ever-questionable acting talents.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah, and there's that dance version of ``American Pie.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the usual conservative critics have been complaining
more about movie violence in the post-Columbine cultural climate
and laying off films with more sexually based themes recently.
Witness the absence of predicted thunder from the right about the
``Lolita'' remake and the yet-unmaterialized attacks on
abortion-rights Oscar nominee ``The Cider House Rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, as Madonna, Everett and veteran director John Schlesinger
hope, times have simply changed enough for ``Next Best Thing'' to
be considered a contemporary family comedy-drama rather than a
lightning rod for political advocacy.
</P>
<P>
   As long, that is, as you agree with their point of view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every story is different,'' says provocateur and noted single
mother Madonna. ``I think, more than anything, it's important that
people understand that families come in all shapes and sizes.
People have to learn to be much more open and tolerant of those
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   But with everything from the Elian Gonzales contretemps to
Proposition 22 to the David Crosby-Melissa Etheridge-Julie Cypher
revelation in the news these days, it's obvious that tolerance is
only one of a wide range of reactions to modern family issues. Of
course, that also means ``Next Best Thing'' is clearly a reflection
of the times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a film for now,'' notes Schlesinger, who began his
filmmaking career with such of-the-moment '60s features as
``Darling,'' ``A Kind of Loving'' and the Oscar-winning, X-rated
``Midnight Cowboy.'' ``I don't think we made it saying, `This is an
issue, therefore, this is something we should be doing.' We just
moved to a situation where, in life, families take on all sorts of
different configurations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's also the fact that we're discussing, much more openly
than we ever did in the past, issues that we never would have
dreamt of bringing up just a few decades ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Englishman Everett, who's stolen such films as ``My Best
Friend's Wedding'' playing drolly matter-of-fact gay characters,
helped rewrite Thomas Ropelewski's original ``Next Best'' script to
make his role more realistic. But Everett insists that the film's
primary concerns go beyond the representation issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is a gay film,'' Everett says. ``It's about
family, love and parenthood. My character is a very positive gay
role model, in that he's a good man. In the original screenplay, he
was an asexual, flubby interior decorator whose answer to every
problem was to get some whipped cream out of the refrigerator and
squirt it around. We made him into an ordinary '90s man who was a
practicing homosexual and a great father.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Everett's Robert, an L.A. landscape designer,
commiserates with his oft-jilted best friend, Madonna's yoga
instructor Abbie, over one long, drunken, holiday weekend following
the funeral of a close friend. One thing leads to another, and not
long after the shocked pair awakens in each other's arms, Abbie
discovers that she's pregnant. Deciding to have the child, she
offers Robert as much or as little involvement in its upbringing as
he wishes.
</P>
<P>
   To even perhaps his own surprise, Robert moves in with Abbie.
For more than half a decade, they lovingly raise their son, Sam
(played by newcomer Malcolm Stumpf), like any other devoted couple
who keep separate bedrooms. Robert still sees lovers, but his first
commitment is always to his son. Ditto Abbie, until she's swept off
her feet by New York-based investor Ben (``Law &AMP; Order's'' Benjamin
Bratt), whose proposal involves a cross-country relocation.
</P>
<P>
   Though all three adults basically mean well, an ugly court fight
ensues.
</P>
<P>
   Schlesinger, who addressed gay issues in such films as
``Darling'' (1965), ``Cowboy'' (1969), ``Sunday, Bloody Sunday''
(1971) and ``An Englishman Abroad'' (1988) long before it was
generally acceptable, notes that certain producers and the studio
releasing ``Next Best,'' Paramount, expressed reservations about
the film's tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were disagreements with the production side,'' notes the
74-year-old filmmaker, who remains sharp-witted but is noticeably
frail a few months following open-heart surgery. ``They were
worried about the characters being rude to each other or seeming
unsympathetic. But what interested me in doing the movie was the
chance to be honest about the characters in every way. We worked
very hard to make it so and I think it is that. But sometimes, it
was an uphill battle.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, early critical response to the film seems to be more
negative toward Abbie's behavior than to anything that Robert
represents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching the movie with one of my best friends and she
slugged me in the middle of the screening!'' Madonna reveals.
``She's like, `How could you do that?' and I said, `I didn't do
that, my character did it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Schlesinger feels that such reactions _ especially from people
who aren't her friends _ result from the extra baggage that comes
with everything Madonna does.
</P>
<P>
   ``The character does true and honest things in situations that
she doesn't know how to deal with, not wicked things,'' he
observes. ``People impute all too easily and quickly. Madonna is a
controversial character as herself, and I think that people are
very ready to jump on a bandwagon and say, `Isn't she terrible.'''
</P>
<P>
   The director does concede, however, that when it comes to the
singer's acting abilities, those who found something lacking in
``Who's That Girl,'' ``Body of Evidence'' and even ``Evita,'' among
others, had a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, the one word that a performer never wants to hear
is `relax,''' Schlesinger notes. ``And I was conscious that she is
so deliberate in what she's created that one wanted to get rid of
that and make it just happen. Now, I don't know how we did it
because we did occasionally spar, but that stopped quite early on
and she became flexible. She understood her character very well,
and it really was a question of gaining her confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Madonna is a pretty good sport about the touchy
subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you; I'll say it,'' she quips. ``Now I have gotten
better in choosing movies.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the questionable cover of Don McLean's poetic
baby-boomer narrative, however, a shift-the-blame game kicks in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't my idea, it was Rupert's,'' she says of the newly
syncopated ``American Pie.'' ``I didn't care about it in the
beginning. I kept saying, `You should do it, it's your idea.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, she did it!'' Everett hedges. ``But I wanted to find an
original song that could be part of the motif for the film. I
wanted some kind of honky-tonky, guitar-piano song that could
almost be something you'd hear from car radios driving by parts of
L.A. And, for promotional and other reasons, it had to be
convertible to techno, so I thought `American Pie' was ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   At least that's one potential controversy that's been weathered.
Listeners, including McLean himself, have endorsed the refurbished
classic.
</P>
<P>
   As for the movie, expectations among the key players are mixed
but upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the film will be attacked from political
quarters, but I can't be sure,'' Schlesinger says, then lets loose
a jolly laugh. ``But if that's the way they see it, so be it,
there's nothing I can do to change it. Yes, it is what it is. But I
don't think it's shocking. It's quite sweetly done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I would like people to take away from the film would be a
re-evaluation of family values,'' Everett says. ``What makes a
family? Blood isn't the only thing in a family. Commitment is in a
family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen _ I think the most important thing for families is
love,'' Madonna concludes. ``And that comes in all different
forms.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Dig in for a 24-karat fall
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   All that glitters is not gold. But all that's gold is suddenly
trendy.
</P>
<P>
   As the fashion shows in New York, Milan and Paris have shown so
far, silver's popularity is plummeting. Call it a knee-jerk
reaction to the ever-booming economy, but gold _ the
internationally recognized color of money _ is becoming the new
standard of stylishness.
</P>
<P>
   Its true weight won't fall on us until the next crop of
cold-weather wearables reaches shops. But the glint of gold's
growing appeal was evident Sunday during a stroll down Paris'
chicest strip of stores, the Rue du Faubourg St. Honore.
</P>
<P>
   Mannequins at Versace had their white linen suits accessorized
with thin gold chains. Gold zippers on the tie-dyed snakeskin jeans
at Roberto Cavalli gave the pants extra pizazz. The belted cashmere
cardigans at Van Laak had golden buckles. The buttons on Louis
Feraud's tropical weight wool suits were gold as well.
</P>
<P>
   To my eye, gold doesn't have the same modern appeal as silver or
platinum. Nor does it seem to meld as well with clothes on the
cooler end of the color spectrum. But gold's what's new now. So let
the mining begin.

 &HT;    My appreciation of houseplants deepens as their numbers fade
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As March ushers houseplants off center stage, in favor of all
those outdoor harbingers of spring, let us give thanks to our
tireless potted friends that labored mightily throughout the winter
to keep our homes agrowing.
</P>
<P>
   I garden indoors as seriously as I garden outdoors, although in
an effort to pare down and practice some semblance of moderation, I
am amazed to say that my interior plants number far fewer than
several years ago. Then, watering upstairs and down amounted to a
three-hour pleasure on some days (as all gardeners know, watering
is never just watering, outdoors or in; there's the close
examination, the reacquaintances, the touching, looking for
changes).
</P>
<P>
   Now, I water in an hour.
</P>
<P>
   This big change (it has come through giveaways, throwaways and
deaths) has opened new pathways throughout the house _ and improved
relations with Lyn, who had complained for more than a decade that
running a vacuum or mop through the house was like running an
obstacle course.
</P>
<P>
   Like paring down anyplace _ in the outdoor garden or in life _
the slimmer indoor collection offers increased opportunities to
appreciate what remains. In the library, for instance, ferns used
to hang from the ceiling, and the floor was covered with little
pots of Christmas cactus, along with a huge jade. Now, the cactus
plants and ferns have found new homes, the jade, alas, up and died,
and all that remains is one huge grape ivy that hangs from the
ceiling. I never fail to stop and stare at it when I enter the
room.
</P>
<P>
   In the rear parlor, two ornamental figs, a coffee plant, a
gardenia, episcia and peace lily grow where three times that many
plants once lived.
</P>
<P>
   And by the windows in the kitchen, once home to dozens of
path-blocking pots, only a few survive the down-paring, including a
tall old crinkly-leafed aralia and our 15-year old friend Sarah
Frond (the first plant Lyn and I ever owned together). Some 20
plants used to live in the east-facing room.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if growing fewer indoor plants and appreciating
them more as individuals had anything to do with the jewel orchid's
blooming comeback, but I'm glad to see it.
</P>
<P>
   Orchids in general always have been spectacular indoor plants,
as their flowers last for weeks and weeks, lending a colorful and
tropical air to interior spaces, even in the gray of winter.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I have never had much success in coaxing new
blooms from my orchids after the initial nursery-grown blossoms
fade. The lone exception to this pitiful pattern was the jewel
orchid, which I began growing about 10 years ago. (It is the only
one I've grown in regular potting soil instead of the special
orchid mixtures of shredded bark, peat and such.)
</P>
<P>
   For the first few years, the jewel orchid bloomed. Then,
nothing. Until December, when I noticed a swelling pinkish bud
emerging from the tip of the vinelike plant. The single bud,
nestled among the velvety green leaves with burgundy veins, slowly
grew larger, so slowly that by January, I figured it soon would
retreat to where it was trying to come from. Instead, it rode atop
a matchstick-diameter stalk that eventually lengthened to about 10
inches, gradually opening into a shower of tiny white flowers with
yellow centers.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, I counted the little winged blossoms radiating in all
directions, until, by the end of February, 15 had opened, with one
to go.
</P>
<P>
   As I anticipate that final pop akin to the satisfying sigh of a
champagne cork, I salute the bejeweled orchid, the season's
comeback king. And all its housemates. They've kept me growing
inside, gotten me to the verge of spring, outside.

 &HT;    The 50th Pillsbury Bakeoff
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With a little yelp that could summon Darva
Conger from a mile away, Bobbie Sonefeld of Hopkins, S.C., became a
millionaire yesterday at the 50th annual Pillsbury Bakeoff.
</P>
<P>
   Sonefeld, 35, took the $1 million top prize with her recipe for
Cream Cheese Brownie Pie, a 600-calorie-a-slice confection that the
judges dubbed ``the best of two worlds _ a pie and a brownie.''
</P>
<P>
   An administrative assistant and mother of two young boys,
Sonefeld submitted her winning recipe over the Internet. It was
selected as one of 100 finalists from among ``tens of thousands''
of entries by Pillsbury, and Sonefeld was invited to San Francisco
to pit it against such contenders as Chicken Waldorf Pizza, Seaside
Shortcakes and Guess Again Candy Crunch.
</P>
<P>
   The finalists came from 36 states, and included a trial
attorney, a chemistry professor, a farmer, an Emmy winner and 21
full-time homemakers.
</P>
<P>
   The bakeoff began, as it always does, with the Grand March.
After a very Pillsbury breakfast of snack breads, bacon and french
toast topped with peach salsa (including bits of red and green
pepper), the contestants slapped on their aprons and proceeded to
the bakeoff ballroom at precisely 8 a.m. Led by elderly family
heiress Sally Pillsbury _ resplendent in red, white and blue _ and
a woman in an inflated Doughboy costume, they toured the ballroom
clapping their hands in time to a blurry rap tune.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Traylor of Rome (Georgia's only contestant this year),
took her position at Range No. 59 and ripped open a bag of Green
Giant broccoli florets. Her mission: to prepare her winning recipe
for Broccoli-Jicama Salad three times. Once for display. Once for
onlookers to try. And once to submit to the sequestered jury of
food writers and cookbook authors. The recipe is a heavily adapted
version of a salad Traylor clipped from Southern Living that used
broccoli and water chestnuts. She added dried cranberries and a
creamy dressing made with lemon yogurt.
</P>
<P>
   Deep in the midst of the ``Yummy Vegetable'' aisle, Traylor was
a coil of pure adrenaline. A small woman with short-cropped black
hair and big glasses, she inherited an addiction to cooking
contests from her mother, with whom she lives. Until now, neither
mother nor daughter had made it to the bakeoff _ the big kahuna of
cooking contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother was shocked when they called,'' said Traylor, 43, as
she took a chef's knife to a jicama. ``But that's because she hates
broccoli. Boy, these knives are sharp! Hold on just a minute, I
don't want to cut myself.''
</P>
<P>
   With many small slices, Traylor removed every bit of peel and
turned the jicama into a multifaceted white jewel. She set a
steaming basket in a saucepan for the broccoli, grabbed a box
grater and zealously reduced the jicama to shreds.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother said, `Why don't you julienne the jicama?' I said,
'Mother, I've already injured myself once with a jicama.''' She
held out her hand to show the faint scar.
</P>
<P>
   As Traylor talked, she noticed a disturbing pool of juice
forming in the bowl of grated shreds. ``Looks like they just sent
them down to Mexico to pick it fresh,'' said Traylor. ``I've never
seen such a juicy jicama.'' She reached into her mini-cabinet and
grabbed a strainer.
</P>
<P>
   Other details were wrong as well. The flat-surface range heated
so quickly that she overcooked the broccoli. The yogurt didn't look
as yellow as lemon Dannon yogurt in Georgia. So the first batch,
with overcooked broccoli, went to the display table. The second
batch would be for the judges.
</P>
<P>
   Over at Range No. 92, Lauren Eggeman of Massillon, Ohio, worried
that she put too much ginger in her first batch of Sugar &AMP; Spice
Black Pepper Cookies. But she was poised and nonplussed.
Particularly for an 11 year old.
</P>
<P>
   Eggeman, the youngest contestant this year, candidly admitted,
``I never follow recipes. But, you know, nothing turns out that
good the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6th grader's earliest memory of cooking is of sitting on the
kitchen table watching her mom cook when she was 2. From her
Grandma she learned to make cookies _ and put black pepper in them.
``I added more ingredients like clove and ginger. My brother liked
them, and it was my Mom's idea to enter them.''
</P>
<P>
   At Range No. 49, Hal Fisher of Inman, S.C., fashioned a delicate
pile of Corn and Pea Salad with Cinnamon-toasted Pecans. All of his
buddies in his Spartanburg Harley Owners Group are ``100 percent
behind'' his Bakeoff dreams. Fisher, a mild-mannered funeral
director who looks nothing like a ZZ Top member, likes to cook for
his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   A few contestants seemed deep in concentration, trying to make
everything perfect. Others took the ``quick and easy'' credo to
heart. Rachel Kluger, a sociology student from Palm Springs, Ca.,
chuckled when I asked her if I was bothering her. ``Are you
kidding? I'm just opening cans!''
</P>
<P>
   At about half past 10, Linda Traylor and her escort brought a
covered casserole dish filled with Broccoli-Jicama salad to the
judges for consideration. They marched past a media table. They
marched down a cordoned aisle and turned a corner to meet a phalanx
of Pillsbury execs who looked like the Men in Black.
</P>
<P>
   Head honcho Dave Schmitt clocked her in at 10:37 a.m. and handed
her a serious yellow form. ``Read this, make sure it's true, sign
the bottom line,'' he commanded. She signed and handed him the
casserole. Yummy Vegetables is serious business.
</P>
<P>
   As the Bakeoff rolled to its 1 p.m. cutoff, contestants began
putting out samples. Sally Pillsbury clutched the gold chain of her
purse as she made the rounds in the company of her nephew, and it
hung so low it swung alongside her red patent leather pumps with
red-white-and-blue houndstooth bows. She helped herself to two
servings of broccoli-jicama salad. ``Is it good?,'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmmmph,'' she answered.
</P>
<P>
   As giddy contestants exited, the Doughboy stood ready for the
perpetual photo op. Though he/she couldn't talk, people could
communicate with the fleshy center by shouting into a netted hole
in the side of the costume.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, the awards were announced on a live
Oscar-style telecast hosted by TV star Phylicia Rashad
(''Cosby'').The four $10,000 categories were called up to the
stage: Easy Weeknight Meals, Yummy Vegetables, Casual Snacks &AMP;
Appetizers, and the engine that drives the Pillsbury machine, Fast
&AMP; Fabulous Desserts &AMP; Treats.
</P>
<P>
   Pillsbury staffer Sally Peters wheeled a domed platter big
enough to conceal a Sheltie onto the stage and lifted the top to
reveal Cream Cheese Brownie Pie. Bobbie Sonefeld held her hands to
her face and yelped. She was a new millionaire.
</P>

 &HT;    Kathie Lee calls it quits with Regis
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it the Reege Effect: Nothing can exist that exists opposite
Reege.
</P>
<P>
   Not any show that any network airs against Regis Philbin on
ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' And now not even Kathie
Lee Gifford, who for 11 years has been the other half of ``Live
With Regis &AMP; Kathie Lee.''
</P>
<P>
   Gifford announced during Tuesday's syndicated show (airing
locally at 9 a.m. on WSB) that she was leaving the popular coffee
klatch when her contract expires in July. Yet after the initial
``ooooh'' of suprise from the studio audience _ ``I was hoping you
would do that,'' Gifford said _ the show became less about her
leaving than about Philbin staying.
</P>
<P>
   Guests Lorraine Bracco (``The Sopranos'') and Dolly Parton both
arrived with roses for Philbin and joked they were ready to fill
Gifford's seat the second she left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live in New York ...'' Bracco cooed.
</P>
<P>
   No replacement has been announced.
</P>
<P>
   As for Philbin, he looked neither bothered by Gifford's exit,
nor excited by the prospect of replacing her. Instead, he looked
exactly like a guy who'd just signed a $20 million contract for
``Millionaire,'' and whose rich morning show contract runs through
August 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Both loved and despised for the depth of her self-absorption,
Gifford, 46, said she was tired of the public ridicule often heaped
on her children, whom she told stories about nearly every morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very thing that has made the show so successful _ host
chat _ is the thing that caused a real concern in my life that my
children be protected,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford became a frequent subject in the tabloids in 1997 after
her husband, pro football Hall of Famer Frank Gifford, was caught
in an affair with a flight attendant, and a target of labor
activists who said her clothing line was produced in foreign
sweatshops.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, she has performed in the Broadway musical revue
``Putting It Together''; Philbin got a standing ovation the night
he walked to his seat in the theater. Gifford also has an upcoming
album, on which Parton sings backup. And last week she hosted CBS'
``Late Show With David Letterman,'' after Philbin backed out
because of a previous commitment.

<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKTON, Calif. _ Sen. John McCain did an about-face Tuesday,
agreeing to participate in a planned Republican debate in
California on Thursday and challenging Gov. George W. Bush to two
other debates before next week's string of crucial primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've accepted every offer and we're not the ones who have
ever turned down debates,'' McCain told reporters traveling with
him on his campaign bus.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator said that he had decided to change his
campaign schedule, canceling a planned rally in Long Island on
Thursday so that he would be able to participate by satellite in
the debate sponsored by CNN and The Los Angeles Times. The forum is
the only Republican debate scheduled in the nation's most populous
state, and it comes five days before the high-stakes primary.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, Bush and Alan Keyes faced each other Tuesday in
primaries in Virginia and Washington state and in a caucus in North
Dakota. But that trio of races served as a mere warm-up to next
week's so-called ``Mega Tuesday'' primaries, when Republicans vote
for their presidential nominee in 11 states _ New York, California,
Connecticut, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri,
Ohio, Rhode Island and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had baffled rivals and supporters alike with his
announcement last Sunday that he was withdrawing from the Los
Angeles debate. His aides said that he had decided to pull out of
the debate to campaign in New York, which also holds its primary
next Tuesday. The McCain campaign said that it had agreed to the
debate weeks ago, but that Bush had only consented last week after
his losses in Michigan and in Arizona. By then, McCain aides said,
the Arizona senator had made other plans.
</P>
<P>
   His decision to participate was an abrupt reversal. On his
campaign bus en route to a town hall meeting Tuesday morning in
Stockton, McCain said again that he would be a no-show at the
debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no possible way,'' McCain replied when asked by
reporters about participating. He also ruled out appearing via
satellite.
</P>
<P>
   But less than an hour later, he reversed himself and said he
would participate in the debate via satellite _ stopping in St.
Louis or Kansas City en route to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're able to adjust our schedule in order to land, cancel
events in New York and participate via satellite,'' McCain told
reporters after his town hall meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   He also challenged Bush to debates on Wednesday night on the
MSNBC news show ``Hardball,'' and on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Even some officials within the McCain campaign were quoted as
saying that his original decision to withdraw from the debate had
been a tactical error.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain wrote off his reversal Tuesday as merely a change in
scheduling that allowed him to stop mid-trip on his way back to the
East Coast and to participate in the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't give you any larger explanation than that because
that's simply the reason behind it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaigned Tuesday in Cleveland, where he met with Catholic
Charities workers at a half-finished family center. Bush used the
opportunity to try again to distance himself from criticism of his
appearance at Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
   ``My regret is that I didn't speak out against anti-Catholic
bias when I had the opportunity to do so,'' Bush said Tuesday. ``I
had the mike.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor expressed similar regrets Sunday in a letter
to Cardinal John O'Connor of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bush accused McCain of making religion a campaign issue and
challenged his rival's claim that he was the political heir to
Ronald Reagan. Bush said that Reagan did not have ``a spiteful
agenda,'' an oblique reference to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had an optimistic agenda as I do,'' Bush said of Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Tuesday about Bush's criticism that he had injected
religion into the race and that he was tearing apart the winning
coalition that Reagan had put together, McCain replied, ``Which
winning coalition are we talking about that stayed together?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost the last two presidential elections, we've lost the
last two congressional elections here in California; it has been
electoral disaster,'' McCain continued. ``To somehow allude to some
winning combination flies in the face of electoral results.''
</P>
<P>
   And McCain continued his drumbeat against Pat Robertson, the
founder of the Christian Coalition, and the Rev. Jerry Falwell, the
founder of the Moral Majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people have led our party out of the mainstream of
America, they are exclusive and not inclusive, they practice
politics of division, not addition,'' he said. ``I'm the candidate
that independents, and Democrats, and Libertarians and vegetarians
have been coming over to support.''

EGYPT TO EXPAND WOMEN'S DIVORCE RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ The narrow corridors of Family Court were once
painted a cheerful red, but now they are pitted and stained with a
dull brown patina of grime and the smoke from countless acrid
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The stories told in these trash-strewn hallways are just as
dismal: children abandoned, families impoverished and women trapped
in marriages they can escape only with permission from their
husbands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't find my husband,'' said Saida Muhammad Osman, a
careworn 50-year-old woman perched on the surviving half of a
broken plastic chair in the crowded hallway of the courthouse in
central Cairo. ``Every few years he comes back for a few days, but
usually I am on my own with my children.''
</P>
<P>
   Osman's hopes are as meager as her circumstances. She dreams of
one day getting a divorce so she can at least collect her dead
father's pension _ hardly a princely sum at 70 Egyptian pounds a
month, the equivalent of just over $6. Knowing her husband can
delay a final judgment for years, she fears that any relief will
come too late to do her family much good.
</P>
<P>
   But change _ no less than a social revolution _ is about to
shake the dingy halls of Egypt's crowded and melancholy courtrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Wednesday, Egypt will put in place one of the Muslim
world's most far-reaching reforms of family law. Enacted with the
support of the country's religious establishment, it makes divorce
for the first time an equal-opportunity alternative to an unhappy
marriage. Among countries in the region, only Tunisia has a similar
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before this, I really did not want my own daughter to get
married because I saw again and again the trap that a woman can be
in in this country,'' said Muhammad Amer, a Cairo lawyer who is
considered an expert on Islamic family law and who lobbied for the
changes. ``Now I'm not worried, because she can get rid of the man
when she wants.''
</P>
<P>
   With the new law, a woman will be able to divorce her husband,
with or without his assent. And she will also be able to call on
the Egyptian government to garnishee her husband's wages if he
refuses to provide for her. And if he disappears or cannot pay a
court-ordered living allowance, she will be able to draw from a
special state bank to keep her family afloat.
</P>
<P>
   When they were proposed by President Hosni Mubarak late last
year, the changes drew fierce opposition from conservative
lawmakers, who said women were too flighty to be entrusted with the
option of no-fault divorce. The proposals also were widely
lampooned in the press as the work of man-hating feminists and of
secularists who were trying to twist Islam for their own ends.
</P>
<P>
   But an alliance of moderate Muslim clerics, women's advocates,
civil court judges and divorce lawyers endorsed the reforms. In an
effort to head off a backlash from Islamic hard-liners, they
mounted a public relations effort to convince people that the law
is a modern rendering of the equal rights that Islam bestows on
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Egyptian society is not in the best condition now to
discuss this law,'' said Fathi Naguib, an assistant justice
minister who drafted the law. ``But every society needs a shock,
one that doesn't go so far that it can't be absorbed but one that
is still a little step forward. This was a necessary and overdue
shock.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Family law is generally based on Sharia, or the 1,400-year-old
Islamic legal code, in Muslim countries, including Egypt. In
general, this has come to mean that a Muslim man can get a no-fault
divorce automatically. But a woman is entitled to one only if she
proves to a court that her husband beats her, is a drug addict, is
sterile or does not support the family.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, though, it is even harder for women. They often are
stymied by judges who discount their complaints, according to human
rights reports prepared by private organizations and the U.S. State
Department. Even when she is granted a divorce, a woman may not be
free because her husband can appeal the decree indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   In Egypt, where the civil and criminal codes are an amalgam of
secular and Islamic law, there have been occasional attempts to
eliminate what many women saw as discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, President Anwar Sadat issued a decree requiring a man
to inform his wife if he intended to marry a second wife. If she
objected, she could divorce him after a year's cooling-off period.
But the decree was later declared unconstitutional on procedural
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Sadat's successor, Mubarak, did not try to restore that law, but
he did approve the Parliament's more modest 1985 amendment that
repealed an Ottoman-era rule making it a crime for a woman to run
away from an abusive husband.
</P>
<P>
   The impetus for the new, more sweeping change in Egypt's laws
came from people who have spent years watching the system in
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dreamed of having this new law for 28 years, ever since I
was just a small judge working in the field of family law and
seeing how women suffer from the system,'' said Naguib, who
described himself as a lifelong advocate of women's rights. ``I saw
how they could stay in the courts 12, 14, 15 years without getting
a divorce. It was very painful to witness.''
</P>
<P>
   Little has changed in Egypt's divorce courts, where a total of
1.2 million cases are filed each year by both men and women, but
only about 71,000 are granted by the system's overworked judges.
</P>
<P>
   Fathi Shaheen, a gaunt man of 75, has made his living for the
last 40 years at the Shobra courthouse helping illiterate women
prepare their requests for divorce. He said he had seen more tears
than he cared to remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always see women crying because they have no one to provide
for them,'' he said recently. ``These men, they are greedy and they
want to make the woman suffer, so they keep filing appeal after
appeal. In my time, men saw women as something sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A few feet away, a young woman who would give her name only as
Samia leaned against a filthy wall. Dozens of people jostled around
her, trying to spot their names on a handwritten list of 150
divorce cases to be heard that day by a single judge. Samia, who
was granted a divorce three years ago on the ground that her
husband beat her, was an island of resigned calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an expert at this,'' she said. ``I go to court all the
time because my husband keeps appealing our divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, who was trying to distract Samia's young daughter
with a cracker, chimed in. ``They treat women like animals,'' she
said. ``Why can they keep appealing? Appeals are for murderers and
criminals. Meanwhile, the man goes out and gets married and has a
happy life, while the wife has to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with Egypt's new law, a wife who wants a divorce over the
objections of her husband will have to return to her husband any
money or property that he paid as a bride price upon the marriage.
</P>
<P>
   That provision was the price paid for the support of some of
Egypt's leading Muslim authorities. It is a specific reference to
an event from the life of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, who once
permitted an unhappy woman to leave her husband but required her to
return the garden he had given her when they married.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you touch a sensitive area like this, you must speak to
society in its language,'' Naguib said. ``And here, the language of
religion is most convincing.''

 &HT;    AOL, TIME WARNER SAY MERGER WOULD NOT DOMINATE CYBERSPACE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chairmen of America Online Inc. and Time Warner
Inc. told skeptical senators Tuesday that their planned mega-merger
would not create an all-controlling gatekeeper for cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the Senate Judiciary Committee began a hearing on
the pending deal, Time Warner, the world's biggest media company,
and AOL, the leading Internet service provider, pledged to open up
their combined cable TV system to rival Web-access firms.
</P>
<P>
   While the companies portrayed their agreement on cable systems
as a sensible business decision, their vow was also clearly aimed
at easing lawmakers' bipartisan concerns about the potential impact
of their giant combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to ensuring that our merger creates new
choices for consumers and promotes a diversity of voices in the
culture,'' AOL Chairman Steve Case told the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Case's views about deal, valued at about $185 billion when it
was announced on Jan. 10, were echoed by Time Warner's Gerald
Levin, whose testimony waxed rhapsodically on the promise of the
Internet while skirting the senators' widely voiced antitrust
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Said Levin, who would head the joint company: ``Although the age
we've entered will be brutally unsparing of companies that can't or
won't move fast enough, it will also empower citizens as never
before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of what I have heard sounds good,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, the committee chairman, told the two witnesses. ``But I
believe a degree of healthy skepticism is in order given what is at
stake here.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the close of the three-hour hearing, Hatch noted that
their new open-access ``memorandum of understanding'' wasn't a
binding document and that it was ``subject to all pre-existing
(exclusionary) obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   Would Levin, Hatch wanted to know, be willing to now bind the
company to the terms?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a legal nicety,'' Levin replied. ``It's a
personal commitment. When we went into (cable modems), it was an
untested area. ... But it's clear now that there's capacity (for
other providers) in this digital bank account. So today's
commitment has true significance.''
</P>
<P>
   As laid out by Levin and Case, the new policy places no fixed
limits on the number of Internet providers who can link up to the
new company's high-speed network. Nor, squelching another potential
objection, would the company block or limit their competitors'
ability to offer video streaming _ in effect, a real-time Internet
TV program.
</P>
<P>
   To show that their hearts were in the right place, Case and
Levin arranged for the hearing to appear on the Web site of the
committee's senior Democratic member, Sen. Patrick Leahy of
Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Seated on the dais, Leahy watched himself on his wireless
laptop. He also tracked e-mail questions and comments from Internet
viewers, some of which he posed to the witnesses as the hearing
progressed. This interactive real-time feedback loop was a first in
Senate history, Leahy noted.
</P>
<P>
   Also present, although in a low-tech mode, was Sen. Mike DeWine,
R-Ohio. ``The more I examine this deal, the more I am convinced
that it does raise very significant competition and public policy
issue that must be thoroughly explored.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of same merger issues will be reviewed on Thursday in a
session called by the Senate Commerce Committee. And Hatch pledged
to hold at least one additional hearing soon to solicit the views
of consumer groups and technology and antitrust experts.

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The room began as an empty canvas. But Joan Dial had an idea
and, more importantly, an artist to make her dreams and those of
her children come true.
</P>
<P>
   The result could be called Fairy Tale Magic. It's a children's
playroom where several of 4-year-old Justin Dial's favorite
characters _ including, ``Toy Story's'' Buzz and Woody, Christopher
Robin and the Seven Dwarfs _ all share wall space. Justin's baby
sister, Jessica, 10 months, doesn't have favorites just yet, but
her parents figured she might like to share a room with Snow White
and Cinderella. Artist Doreen Behnke added Tarzan and Jane after
Justin saw _ and flipped for _ the summer Disney movie.
</P>
<P>
   Male and female. For Justin and Jessica. And for any other
additions to the Dial family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted the whole upstairs for the kids to be really fun,''
said Joan Dial, who lives in Agoura Hills, ``a fun and inviting
place, something that reflects their interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Rooms getting a theme makeover aren't necessarily for children.
This, after all, is L.A. _ land of dreams. If you imagine it,
somebody can build it. Somebody who knows where to track down
hard-to-find items or how to get a waterfall into a bedroom. But
the more elaborate your fantasy, the more it's likely to impact
your pocket book.
</P>
<P>
   Interior designers cited specific examples: a recreation room
done with `50s soda fountains; an animator with a passion for all
things circus; a replica of the Egyptian Theatre in a subterranean
screening room; a big game hunting enthusiast who _ political
correctness aside _ insisted on decorating a room with actual
stuffed animals in his room of choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more interested in having their living space
reflect what they believe to be a statement about themselves or
something they're really interested in,'' said Leah Vasquez, an
artist and designer based in Laguna Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassed by your desire for an in-home design fantasy? You
shouldn't be, said the dream builders. A themed room is simply an
extension of that interest. The practice isn't common yet, but
there will always be a client with a mania for something.
</P>
<P>
   When they were hired to design the North Carolina recreation
room of former NASCAR racer Ernie Irvan, officials at Rancho
Cucamonga- based Penwal Industries went positively hog wild: a
symphony of chrome, from ceiling to floor, authentic gas pumps,
crankshafts and tires. Even a portion of a Formula 1 race car above
the custom-designed bar.
</P>
<P>
   Irvan had trophies and racing outfits that he wanted displayed,
but he had no idea how to pull it off. He has young children at
home, but this room was primarily for the entertainment and
pleasure of Irvan, his friends and sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Penwal designers met with the racer, submitted sketches and went
to work. The rec room was completed in three months, about half the
time it takes Penwal to do a commercial job.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the entertainment field have been creating these
props and faux finishes,'' said Diane Bader, a marketing executive
at Penwal. ``We're saying you can bring these same elements into
your home. If you want to create a storybook look, we would be the
ones to sculpt, do the molds, create the fiberglass models,
whatever it took to create that whole look.''
</P>
<P>
   The Irvan rec room was Penwal's first job, and now they're
hungry for more. Having built the company's reputation on interior
design of toy stores, movie-themed stores and a Las Vegas hotel,
Penwal is looking to bring what they have termed ``home-theming.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether they'll have competition from other commercial designers
or set builders is anybody's guess. Many design companies
accustomed to building movie sets say they aren't likely to start
assembling the Knights of the Round Table fantasy in a private
living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the scale they work, I don't know that my companies would
want to build two or three trees,'' said Jim Presnall, executive
director of the Themed Entertainment Association. ``We would rather
do 2,000 to 3,000 trees for a Disney project.''
</P>
<P>
   Interior designers will remind their richly dreaming clients
that any room in any house has to weather the test of time and
changing impulses. Children's rooms, bathrooms and play areas lend
themselves most easily to theming, but will your son be the same
L.A. Dodgers fanatic at age 13 that he was at age 8? If not, his
parents will be the ones forking out the bucks to change the
display.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to go to a themed restaurant and another to
live in it every day,'' said B.J. Peterson, an interior designer
who has offices in the Pacific Design Center. ``People who wax
nostalgic tend to incorporate it into a certain room of the
house.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dial rooms might be called low-key thematic. The playroom
contains shelves of carefully organized books and toys, but the
only piece of furniture that ties into the wall mural is a small
couch with a Winnie the Pooh throw pillow. Placed next to a
newsstand-style book shelf, the couch is tucked in an enclave by
the painting of Christopher Robin reading ``The Dial Fairy Tales''
to Pooh, Piglet and a couple of characters from Disney's ``A Bug's
Life.'' Together, couch and wall illustration make up a true ``Pooh
Corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the playroom was done, the process became addicting. With
Behnke's help, Dial and her husband, Greg, turned one bathroom into
an under-the-sea dreamworld _ with accessories to match. A third
bathroom, leading directly into the playroom, became a castle with
painted vines and pewter accessories.
</P>
<P>
   For the undersea bathroom, Behnke did not stop at the walls and
ceiling. Step stools match the walls; soap dishes, toothbrush
holders and towels all have oceanic elements. Inside the tub,
stencils of fish dot the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't really see the kids outgrowing this,'' said Dial. ``It
can become very addicting. As you start to go, you realize how
personalized it is and how much fun it is. Justin watched Doreen
during the whole process. He was completely fascinated.''
</P>
<P>
   Behnke, who began doing murals following the birth of her
children, agrees. It's all in fun, and she gets lots of referrals
from people who see her work and are willing to let their
imaginations run free.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's endless,'' she said. ``I just did the kitchen for a
single guywho has a beach home in Malibu. It's the sky, and in the
middle, there's a great big pineapple. He loves it, and he has no
kids.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Broadway's historic theaters have been named for
actors and actresses, playwrights and critics, producers and
patrons of the arts. Not until Tuesday have any of them been named
for airline companies.
</P>
<P>
   But in an $8.5 million dollar deal that may well foreshadow the
corporate renaming of a host of Broadway houses, the nonprofit
Roundabout Theater Co. is rechristening the venerable Selwyn
Theater on 42nd Street the American Airlines Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Winter Garden Theater, where ``Cats'' is expected
to close in June after nearly 18 years, may soon become the
Cadillac Theater or the Cadillac Winter Garden. The Shubert
Organization, which owns the theater, has been in discussions with
General Motors about the possibility of such a deal.
</P>
<P>
   And with some trepidation over whether widespread corporate
renaming will cheapen the theater district, officials at Broadway's
two other major chains say they are open to putting the logos of
corporations and products on their theaters as well.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists may shudder at the thought of corporations'
buying their way onto the marquees, but theater owners and
marketing experts say these alliances will grow and could become a
widespread and lucrative practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to change both the face and the economics of
Broadway,'' said Lindsey Gruson, the president and chairman of
STET, a marketing group that has been advising the Shuberts on the
Cadillac deal. ``It's a marriage made in heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   But even among some of those who would stand to benefit
financially there is uneasiness. ``The name of the game is
maximizing the value of your assets and branding them,'' said Rocco
Landesman, president of Jujamcyn, which owns five Broadway
theaters. ``But if you take a long-term view of our properties, we
certainly have other interests besides that, like maintaining the
dignity and quality of the experience of going to the theater and
protecting the buildings and protecting the American theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just marketers,'' Landesman continued. ``We're also
producers and custodians of a proud theatrical tradition. The
Walter Kerr still sounds a lot better to me than `the AT&AMP;T.'''
</P>
<P>
   The interest has arisen since Times Square's recent
transformation into a family-friendly destination as well as a wave
of corporate namings of sports stadiums, bowl games, shopping
centers and out-of-town theaters that left the historic Broadway
houses, almost all of which have official New York City landmark
status, intact. Only 42nd Street's combined and rebuilt Lyric and
Apollo playhouses took on a corporate name _ the Ford Center for
the Performing Arts _ when Livent Inc., opened the house with
`Ragtime'' in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Money, of course, is driving the naming trend. Roundabout's deal
with American provides for the airline _ represented by the
marketing firm Entertainment Management Group (EMG), which has
handled several musical tours and Broadway productions _ to
contribute $850,000 a year to the theater over a period of 10
years. The funds will help underwrite the operations of the
35-year-old Roundabout, which has an annual budget of about $20
million. The Selwyn, which was built in 1918 by Edgar and Arch
Selwyn, has been renovated at a cost of $21 million over the last
two years. To date the company has raised about $17.5 million from
donors including the city, board members and subscribers. It will
open for use on April 11 with previews of a new production of
Chekhov's ``Uncle Vanya.''
</P>
<P>
   American's name will remain on the marquee for the duration of
the partnership as well as on other materials associated with
theater, including all tickets and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Haimes, the artistic director of the Roundabout company,
said that naming the refurbished house the American Airlines
Theater seemed no different to him than naming it for an individual
benefactor, as the company did when it named a theater after Laura
Pels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wonderful that a major corporation would support
the arts and want their name on our theater,'' Haimes said. ``I
don't have a philosophical problem with it.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   An executive at American, which has attached its name to sports
arenas in Miami and Dallas, said the naming would underscore its
presence in New York, where it has begun construction on a $1.3
billion terminal at John F. Kennedy Airport. ``It's one of our most
important markets,'' said Tom Gleason, the regional vice president
for American's eastern division. ``We wanted to look at a different
way of being part of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   The theater's focus on classics and musical revivals already
reduces the risk of controversial content, but what happens if the
Roundabout's artistic content comes into conflict with the
airline's corporate agenda?
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly made it completely clear that we have to have
complete control over what appears on our stage,'' Haimes said.
``And they were completely comfortable with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Birch, a senior vice president at Octagon Marketing in
Stamford, which has been working with the Shuberts, said that
Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert organization, had been
urged by his friend Gruson, a former correspondent for The New York
Times, to reach out for corporate alliances.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld said the deal was nowhere near consummation and
declined to discuss details. ``This is a matter that has to be
submitted to the board here,'' he said. ``I cannot tell you
anything now.''
</P>
<P>
   Birch said he was fairly certain that the Shubert partnership
with General Motors would come to pass, though he said he suspected
that the Shubert Organization would leave the names of most of its
16 theaters intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're going to do it,'' Birch said. ``You never know
what's going to happen, but we have met about it a few times and
it's clear that the concept works.''
</P>
<P>
   Birch said that the theater in general offers corporations an
attractive group of upscale, cultured consumers. ``I think they
realize that theater is a great target market and it's relatively
uncluttered,'' Birch said of Cadillac.
</P>
<P>
   Gust Kouvaris, a managing director at GM RWorks, a promotion and
special events company, who has been involved in the discussions,
did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the Shubert organization was a particularly
attractive partner because in addition to its theaters it owns
Telecharge, the telephone ticket service. ``They own a lot of
terrific, leverageable assets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This, Birch said, means that Shubert has a direct line to
theatergoers by mail and telephone, providing a company like
General Motors with easy access to potential customers. ``One could
ask them, `Would you be willing to take a test drive of an
automobile to get a free ticket along with one you buy?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, these developments are a logical extension of
the growing corporate presence on Broadway, which includes new
producers like Disney, Cablevision and SFX Entertainment, which
about a year ago renamed the Palace Theater in Chicago the Cadillac
Palace. Livent, which had a short life on Broadway, led the
corporate naming drive by setting up Ford Centers not only in New
York but in Chicago, Vancouver and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Broadway establishment has turned increasingly to a
corporate marketing. The League of American Theaters and Producers
has established partnerships with as the ``official airline of
Broadway'' and with Visa U.S.A. as the ``preferred card of
Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Minskoff theater, where ``Saturday Night Fever'' is
playing, the Nederlanders have made a deal with Mercedes-Benz to
place a car in the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole issue of sponsorship is becoming an active
conversation for all theater owners,'' said Nick Scandalios,
executive vice president of the Nederlander Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Scandalios said his company would nevertheless tread lightly in
deciding whether to rename any of its nine theaters. ``It's always
a tricky thing,'' he said. ``We certainly aren't going to look at
renaming the Richard Rodgers and put a beer title over it. You have
to look at the value of a name.''

 &HT;    Carnival parades draw millions of revelers to New Orleans
 &HT;    By Stephen J. O'Brien
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ March 3, 1699, had been going like any other day
for French explorer Pierre LeMoyne Sieur d'Iberville and his men.
The crew of haggard travelers had been exploring the southern
reaches of the Mississippi River and, at least for a night, had
found a home on her western banks near New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   They sunk their shovels into the soft earth of the Atchafalaya
Basin and pitched camp. Noting the day was being observed around
the world as the pre-Lenten festival of Mardi Gras, Iberville
called the spot Point du Mardi Gras.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the party started.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Mardi Gras Creole-style has become one of the
biggest, baddest parties on Earth. Though other cities, including
Galveston, also celebrate the pre-Lenten occasion, New Orleans is
the uncontested Mardi Gras capital of the United States. Official
celebrations there started Feb. 20 and culminate on fat Tuesday,
which this year falls on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going back to 1699 and the first parade, one thing is a
constant,'' said Beverly Gianna, vice president of public affairs
for the New Orleans Convention and Visitors Bureau. ``Everybody
loves a parade.''
</P>
<P>
   And when Gianna says ``everybody,'' she means everybody. The
12-day parade season preceding Ash Wednesday attracts millions of
revelers to the Big Easy.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, there is no theme for Mardi Gras, but as Gianna puts
it, the general mood is understood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attitude is the way (people in New Orleans) live their
culture,'' she said. ``It's not something that we have to
manufacture, a mood we have to create. It's about having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The celebration of Mardi Gras, or fat Tuesday, is followed by
Ash Wednesday and Lenten observations that call on Catholics to
make personal sacrifices leading up to Easter. Mardi Gras can occur
on any Tuesday from Feb. 3 through March 9. The date fluctuates
because it is tied to Easter, which is a floating religious holiday
set by the Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parades always evolve,'' Gianna said. ``They've gotten
bigger and more elaborate, but the fun is always the same. Families
get together, put costumes on, stake out their spots along the
parade routes and bring their picnic baskets.''
</P>
<P>
   Mardi Gras actually means ``fat Tuesday'' in French, but the
celebration has grown far beyond a meager one-day party in places
such as New Orleans and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In New Orleans,
Mardi Gras includes elaborate private balls that start each year
Jan. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Parish ordinance dictates that the New Orleans Mardi Gras parade
season not officially begin until the second Friday before fat
Tuesday. During the 12-day period, nearly 60 parades are held in
the four-parish area of Orleans, Jefferson, St. Bernard and St.
Tammany, according to the ``Arthur Hardy's Mardi Gras Guide.'' The
New Orleans parades and street parties attract close to a million
people each night during the three days leading up to the night of
fat Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what police estimate, but it's hard to determine
exactly how many show up,'' said Arthur Hardy. ``We don't sell
tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest celebrations are the parades known as Bacchus,
Endymion and Orpheus, which are always held the three nights before
fat Tuesday. They feature a total of 110 floats and 90 marching
bands. From their floats, thousands of parade organizers throw more
than 2 million cups, 3.5 million Mardi Gras coins and 400,000
strings of beads.
</P>
<P>
   The official colors of Mardi Gras are purple, gold and green.
Although originally selected because of their aesthetic appeal, the
colors have taken on symbolic meaning: purple for justice, green
for faith and gold for power.
</P>
<P>
   Mardi Gras in New Orleans generated $929 million in the
metropolitan area during the carnival season, according to an
economic impact study by Dr. James McLain of the University of New
Orleans. Before the age of recycling, though, the success of Mardi
Gras in New Orleans was judged by how much trash was generated. In
the 1980s, the 12-day parading season annually generated more than
2,000 tons of trash.
</P>
<P>
   Although other cities are attracting more attention annually for
their Mardi Gras festivities, Hardy said New Orleans will continue
in its role as Mardi Gras headquarters for the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of the people who might be going to Mardi Gras
celebrations outside New Orleans wouldn't be coming here anyway,''
Hardy said. ``I don't think there's anywhere that could compare in
quality and quantity.''
</P>
<P>
   For more information on New Orleans' Mardi Gras celebration,
call the New Orleans Convention and Visitors Bureau at (504)
566-5031.

STATE HISTORICAL PARK GETTING READY FOR TEXAS BIRTHDAY EVENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Texas _ Texas will be 164 years old Thursday, and it
is here, among spreading live oaks and ancient native pecans, that
the official birthday party will take place this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   It was at this location, in what is now the
Washington-on-the-Brazos State Historical Park, that 59 delegates
met in a hastily and ill-prepared meeting hall to claim Texas'
independence March 2, 1836.
</P>
<P>
   Winter winds whipped through the gaps in the walls as they
received word that the Alamo was under siege. William Barrett
Travis, commanding the Texas forces there, made his impassioned
plea, calling on the convention ``in the name of Liberty, of
patriotism, and of everything dear to the American character, to
come to our aid with all dispatch.''
</P>
<P>
   Park officials expect 10,000 to 15,000 visitors this weekend to
tour a re-creation of the Independence Hall, view the exhibits in
the state-of-the-art visitors center, tour the Star of the Republic
Museum and to celebrate the opening of the park's new living
history farm.
</P>
<P>
   The Barrington Living History Farm is the final link in the
park's $6 million improvement package. Scattered along the Brazos
River bottom, the farm is named after Anson Jones' plantation,
which was about five miles from the park. Jones was the last
president of the Republic of Texas and the man who oversaw the
transition to statehood.
</P>
<P>
   ``This completes the story,'' said Barrington Farm manager Bill
Irwin. ``Independence Hall, the town site, all tell the story of
early colonization of Texas. The Star of the Republic Museum does a
great job of telling the story of the 10 years of Texas'
independence; and the farm and the last president speak to the
transition from a republic _ a raw frontier _ to a civilized state
in the union.''
</P>
<P>
   The farm is clearly the jewel of this majestic park. Jones'
home, a 2-story, dogtrot frame, has been beautifully restored. It's
at the farm's center with barns, slave quarters, a kitchen,
smokehouse and chicken coop distributed throughout the flat river
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The farm represents a different form of interpretive history,
living history,'' Irwin said. ``You can touch it, feel it, smell it
and taste it. It allows us to use a different technique to teach
the past and its importance.''

   Five full-time workers assist Irwin with the farm. They wear
period clothing and take on the same kinds of tasks that people in
the 1850s would have. They tend a quarter-acre garden, a cornfield,
cotton field, cattle, pigs and chickens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also have a 100-tree orchard with peach, pear, cherry and
plum trees,'' Irwin said. ``This all came from Jones' account books
and diaries. He kept good track of his planting _ when he planted
and the varieties.''
</P>
<P>
   All farm produce will be used on the farm. The chickens will
provide eggs, meat and feathers. The livestock could end up in the
smokehouse, and the grain crops will be used for animal feed.
</P>
<P>
   Workers will gin, spin and weave the cotton.
</P>
<P>
   The farm will officially open Saturday. Staff and volunteers
will populate the farm, as well as the reconstructed town site.
Visitors can walk among blacksmiths, woodcarvers, furniture makers
and weavers. A ceremony honoring the convention delegates will take
place Sunday.

CHINA HAS NOT CHANGED POLICY ON TAIWAN, SAYS BEIJING OFFICIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (subs next to last graf to correct Blair's title) 
(bl) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A new Chinese policy paper on Taiwan, which has
prompted a furious reaction in the United States, merely
``reiterates the government's consistent stance'' and does not
represent a change in policy, a senior Chinese official said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some foreign media have regarded China as making a major
change to its policy on solving the Taiwan issue,'' state
television quoted Deputy Prime Minister Qian Qichen as saying on
Tuesday evening. ``This view is incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   A ``white paper'' issued last week by the State Council, China's
cabinet, declared that China would be forced to take ``all drastic
measures,'' including military force, under three conditions: if
Taiwan declared independence, if it was invaded by foreign troops,
or if Taiwan's government refused ``indefinitely'' to make progress
on the reunification of Taiwan with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Although the third condition had long been implicit in China's
policy toward Taiwan, which Beijing views as a breakaway province,
it had never been so explicitly stated.
</P>
<P>
   With Taiwan's presidential election just a few weeks away, the
stark inclusion of this third condition in the document was
interpreted in Taiwan and by many Western politicians as a new
direct military threat.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, members of both the administration and Congress
were caught off-guard by the policy paper, and many reacted swiftly
and harshly to the new clause.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. foreign policy analysts said that the potential for a
crisis in the Taiwan Straits was now ``very high.'' Lawmakers said
they would now consider arms sales to Taiwan with a new urgency,
and a congressional vote that is needed to help usher China into
the World Trade Organization suddenly seemed in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   But China's leaders seemed equally taken by surprised at the
passion of the U.S. response. In the past week, Chinese officials
have said in private that the ultimatums in the paper were not new
and were, in fact, intended to encourage a peaceful settlement to
the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
   And ordinary Chinese paid the policy paper little heed. A number
noted that it set no deadline for talks on reunification.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they said they might use force _ they have to say
this _ but it doesn't mean they will,'' said a industrial relations
major at People's University in Beijing, who gave only his surname,
Zhang. ``They're just trying to influence Taiwan's elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper's warning against delaying reunification talks is, at
least, a sign of China's growing impatience with Taiwan, which has
so far been far more interested in negotiating business ties than
reunification.
</P>
<P>
   In recent speeches, President Jiang Zemin and other Chinese
leaders have repeatedly said that reunification with Taiwan is a
top priority, now that Hong Kong and Macau have both been absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite such statements, the mood in China is more
relaxed than in 1996, in the weeks before Taiwan's last
presidential election, when China lobbed missiles near Taiwan. U.S.
warships steamed into the region in a show of support.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, this week, the head of the U.S. Pacific Command, Adm.
Dennis Blair, was in Beijing for a previously scheduled visit with
Defense Minister Chi Haotian and top Chinese military officials.
</P>
<P>
   While Chi told Blair that China would ``never commit not to use
force,'' the New China News Agency reported, he also stressed that
Beijing was ``committed to peaceful reunification with Taiwan.''

&HT;     GOVERNORS OPPOSE SALES TAX BREAK FOR E-COMMERCE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's governors on Tuesday said they
strongly oppose Arizona Sen. John McCain's bill barring states from
collecting sales taxes on Internet commerce and urged the Senate to
defeat the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Sales over the Internet are expected to explode to over $1
trillion by 2003 and many state leaders are concerned that they
will lose a windfall in revenue if these sales escape taxation. And
traditional retailers contend that the tax break would give
cyberspace businesses an unfair advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all agree that would create havoc on states that get 40
percent of their revenue from sales taxes,'' said Gov. Parris N.
Glendening, D-Md., the vice chairman of the National Governors'
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation sponsored by McCain, who is seeking the
Republican presidential nomination, pits him against many GOP
governors who have endorsed Texas Gov. George W. Bush's bid for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John Engler, R-Mich., said the legislation would amount to
``gross federal interference. We would find that highly
objectionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Michael Leavitt, R-Utah, the chairman of the governors'
association, said ``four of five governors across the nation''
believe all businesses should operate under the same basic sales
tax rules.
</P>
<P>
   A commission created by Congress is supposed to make a
recommendation on Internet tax policy in April, but so far there is
no agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make a basic policy decision as a country as to
whether we are going to make a permanent special privilege for one
form of commerce, or are we going to achieve or strive for a level
playing field,'' Leavitt said. ``We've got to get started on the
basic decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt said there is a growing sense of urgency that states
must act quickly if they are going to tax Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   If governors don't move fast ``our opportunity will be lost''
and states could lose tens of millions in revenue, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The governors spoke at a news conference after meeting with
senators on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the Supreme Court ruled that Congress has the authority
to permit states to compel out-of-states vendors to collect the
tax.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, an Internet business or a catalog company is
required to collect sales tax only if it has a retail store in the
state where the order is placed. In some cases, Internet sellers
voluntarily collect sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt said the governors' eventual proposal on Internet
taxation is likely to exclude smaller Internet businesses.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Richard Armey, R-Texas, said Friday that
House GOP leaders are opposed to taxing electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is the future of commerce,'' Armey said.
``Internet business must be free to grow and innovate so it can
better serve consumers and keep e-commerce booming. I want to
assure the 55 million Americans who shop online that we are firmly
committed to a tax-free Internet.''

 &HT;    Marc Jacobs' order at Louis Vuitton: `At ease'
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Marc Jacobs really must feel secure in his job at Louis
Vuitton.
</P>
<P>
   The young New Yorker, who has his own limitedly distributed
label, has entered his second year as design chief of this French
luxury brand, and he's doing it as he sees fit. The fall/winter
Vuitton collection unveiled Monday night _ in a glass house just a
stone's throw from the Louvre _ had a laissez faire attitude. With
the exception of some triangular-weave silk blouses and some
sea-shaded leather separates, most of the clothes looked rather
slouchy. Cashmere bodysuits that Jacobs described in his program
notes as ``oversized,'' nearly drooped off the models' frail frames
entirely. Coats and jackets were double-breasted for the most part,
and they looked about as tailored as your bathrobe. These clothes
looked as relaxed as a government paper-pusher who's outlasted his
probationary period.
</P>
<P>
   Over-reliance on shades of gray cast clouds over the collection,
though pieces of lame and crocodile helped add some luster and luxe
appeal. Jacobs' most amusing move came during the eveningwear
segment, when models trotted out in brown gowns speckled with
yellow. Jacobs called them ``cut-up monogram'' dresses.
</P>
<P>
   Did we mention he seems secure in his job?
</P>
<P>
   Knit wit
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes designers sabotage their collections by trying too
hard to be different. Not Valentino. Though he went out of his way
not to show the new fall/winter staple, blouses, he did so in an
neat and tidy way with form-fitting knitwear that wrapped the torso
and gathered at the waist. Valentino also diverted from the deluge
of bright colors flooding the runways by shading his prim,
often-patchworked daywear in pastels, pale grays and tans. His
tweed suits looked soft and sexy and his pants tended to flare out
from the knee in unpressed pleats. At times, the 84-outfit preview
seemed bogged down with black apparel. But with all the lace,
beading and ruffles Valentino used, the collection couldn't have
looked more ladylike.
</P>
<P>
   Reined in
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there's a method to Martin Margiela's mildness. The
fall/winter 2000 line he designed for Hermes may not have evinced
any of the maverick tendencies for which his own signature
collections are known. But the clothes Margiela showed Sunday at
Hermes' flagship store did nothing to mock the house's solid
sportswear reputation either. A gourdlike shade of orange was the
collection's sole departure from a neutral (black, brown, gray,
tan, cream) color palette. Yet the clothes weren't wholly lacking
originality. Something about the collarless coats (in reversible
lambskin and cashmere), and the gabardine ``comfort'' coveralls
looked new at least. Creating thin leather holsters for alpaca
shawls to be carried in was novel. And the Hermes woman won't have
to worry about anything she picked from this collection looking
``dated'' after just a season because these clothes were free of
the faddish colors and embellishments most designers rely on.
Margiela's latest looks for Hermes won't scream for attention. But
look closely and you may notice how remarkably they resemble the
styles futurists usedto say we'd be wearing in the 21st century.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, temperatures soared into the 60s across the western
Great Lakes as breezes from the south imported unseasonably mild
air into the region. Wednesday, the axis of warmth will shift
eastward, causing 60-degree readings to reach as far north as
Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The day will dawn with sunshine across
the Northeast, however clouds will thicken during the afternoon
ahead of an approaching cold front.
</P>
<P>
   A narrow corridor of showers will accompany the cold front as it
presses eastward through the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley. Isolated
thundershowers may also form as a jet stream disturbance passing
overhead augments the ascent of a moistened air mass. Gusty breezes
from the northwest will follow the front, bringing cooler air to
the upper Middle West and northern Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Plentiful sunshine will promote another day of unusual warmth in
the Southeast, where temperatures reach into the 70s in most areas.
Eighty degree readings will be common over the Florida peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   A vigorous jet stream disturbance will spiral through the
southwest Rockies on Wednesday, causing locally heavy snow
throughout the mountains of northern Arizona and southern Utah.
Later Wednesday night, the disturbance will reach the south-central
states, setting the stage for strong thunderstorms to erupt in
western Texas and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Generally dry weather will cover the West Coast, although there
will be showers on the Northwest coast Wednesday afternoon as moist
Pacific air is lifted by an approaching cold front.
</P>
<P>
   When Winter Ends
</P>
<P>
   While the calendar indicates that winter isn't over until March
20, many meteorologists would say that the season has already
ended. The event commemorated on the calendar is the end of
astronomical winter, a time when the most direct rays of the sun
shift from the southern to the northern hemisphere. For the
purposes of official climate records, winter began on Dec. 1, 1999
and ended on Feb. 29, 2000. According to another unofficial
measurement, winter will pass on March 5th, the end of the coldest
90-day period of the year in most of the northern United States.

 &HT;     McCAIN FACES TOUGH RACES IN CALIFORNIA AND NEW YORK  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL and DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain faces an increasingly tough race
in next Tuesday's presidential primary in New York because Roman
Catholic voters are responding to Texas Gov. George W. Bush's
apology for his comments at Bob Jones University, a New York-based
pollster said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   John Zogby, a Utica, N.Y.-based pollster without ties to any
presidential candidate, said McCain's narrow lead over Bush in New
York is vulnerable because of continued movement toward Bush by
Roman Catholic voters. Another factor, he said, was the tens of
thousands of pro-Bush telephone calls orchestrated by the political
organization of New York Gov. George Pataki and state GOP chair
William Powers.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby said the 16 percentage point edge that McCain held over
Bush among Roman Catholic voters as recently as last Saturday has
been eliminated by Bush's apology to Cardinal John O'Connor and the
repetition of his apology on a daily basis. Roman Catholics make up
about 45 percent of New York's GOP primary electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually have Bush pulling ahead among Catholics by a few
points _ enough to make it a trend _ still a statistical dead heat
but a tremendous turnaround among Catholics,'' Zogby said.
``Perhaps the letter has taken hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Democratic Gov. Gray Davis of California told
reporters that McCain faces an uphill fight in the GOP primary in
the Golden State in which only the votes of registered Republicans
will be counted in the selection of the state's slate of 162
delegates to the GOP national convention.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a veteran of the Vietnam War who praised McCain's service
as a downed Navy pilot imprisoned by North Vietnam for more than
five years, said McCain needs wider appeal than heroic military
service to carry California in his struggle with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``In California, it is not enough to have served your country, a
candidate must champion the issues,'' Davis said, adding that
McCain, like Bush, is ``on the wrong side of issues that matter to
Californians'' such as environmental protection, gun control and
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Bush retains a comfortable lead over McCain in California,
according to The San Francisco Examiner poll conducted for the
newspaper and KTVU-TV by the Research 2000 polling organization in
Rockville, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Bush outpaces McCain 28 percent to 24 percent among all
California voters but the Texas governor's lead over McCain
mushrooms to 41 percent to 30 percent among the Republican voters
whose votes alone will be counted in the selection of the state's
GOP convention delegates. The poll, which has a margin of error of
plus or minus 3.5 percentage points, was conducted Feb. 21 through
23 among 803 Californians who say they regularly vote. Among
Republican voters only, the margin of error is 6 percentage points
because the sample size is smaller.
</P>
<P>
   California and New York, the two most populous states in the
nation, together award a total of 263 delegates to the GOP
nominating convention _ 25 percent of the total of 1,034 needed by
a candidate to secure the GOP presidential nomination. The
delegates in both states will be selected in winner-take-all
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's apology has far less impact in California, where Roman
Catholics make up about 28 percent of the state's electorate. But
in New York, where Roman Catholics are about 45 percent of the
state's GOP primary electorate, Bush's apology is having a wider
impact.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the latest Zogby International survey completed
Monday shows McCain just 1.4 percentage points ahead of Bush _ a
statistical dead heat in a survey with a margin of error of 4.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Zogby said McCain's edge among Roman Catholic voters has
been erased by Bush, who now leads McCain among Roman Catholics, 43
percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   McCain continues to criticize Bush for failing to repudiate the
anti-Catholic teachings and prohibitions on inter-racial dating at
Bob Jones University in South Carolina when he spoke there Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
   McCain defended his criticisms of Bush in remarks in Stockton,
Calif., on Tuesday, saying Bush's remarks at a school associated
with anti-Catholic bias was ``a fair issue for me to raise.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign manager Rick Davis said the McCain campaign continued
making authorized ``Catholic voter alert'' telephone calls to
voters in Washington state in advance of Tuesday's primary to
remind voters that Bush had spoken at Bob Jones University _ ``the
same Bob Jones who said the Pope was ``the Anti-'Christ`` and
called the Church ``a satanic cult.''
</P>
<P>
   The calls added, according to the campaign transcript: ``Sen.
John McCain has strongly criticized this anti-Catholic bigotry,
while Gov. Bush stayed silent while gaining the support of Bob
Jones University.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush addressed several thousand students and faculty at the
predominantly southern Baptist school on Feb. 2 in a bid to rally
Christian conservatives in South Carolina following a stinging 19
percentage point loss to McCain the night before in the New
Hampshire presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy paid off for Bush in the short term, igniting an
unprecedented GOP turnout in South Carolina's Feb. 19 primary that
enabled the two-term Texas governor to defeat McCain, 53 percent to
42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush has paid a political price among Roman Catholic voters
in large industrial states. Bush lost to McCain in Michigan last
Tuesday in part because McCain's campaign aides made telephone
calls to Roman Catholic voters
</P>
<P>
   that helped swell the turnout, enabling McCain to overwhelm
Bush, 51 percent to 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to O'Connor, bush said, ``On reflection, I should
have been more clear in disassociating myself from anti-Catholic
sentiments and racial prejudice.'' His appearance at Bob Jones
University was ``a missed opportunity, causing needless offense,
which I deeply regret,`` Bush wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Bush reiterated his regrets on Tuesday, telling Catholic
Charities workers at a campaign stop in Cleveland, Ohio: ``My
regret is that I didn't speak out against anti-Catholic bias when I
had the opportunity to do so. I had the mike.''.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby said his latest polling in New York detects a ``tremendous
turnaround'' by Bush among Roman Catholic voters.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain has hope among the rank and file Republican voters,
Zogby said, in part because of the state GOP leadership's
ham-handed effort to keep McCain's delegates off the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he has got to count on is that people are turned on by
his biography and turned off by the behavior of the Republican
party _ and then there's a shot,'' Zogby said. ``He's
competitive.''

KATHIE LEE GIFFORD SAYS SHE'LL CALL IT QUITS THIS SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   From now until her announced departure from the morning
airwaves, Kathie Lee Gifford can expect to hear a question made
famous by her cohost, Regis Philbin:
</P>
<P>
   Is that your final answer?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it is. Tuesday, Gifford, 46, startled ``Live With
Regis and Kathie Lee'' viewers by saying she would not renew her
contract with the popular talk show, which expires in August.
Gifford cited family concerns, not contractual issues, as her
reason for moving on.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started together,'' Gifford told Philbin, ``I was not
married, I was childless, and the world was a different kind of
place, too. We could make jokes about things and tell what we did
last night without anyone taking it and sensationalizing it and
making it disgusting and lurid and horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   All that has changed, Gifford suggested, now that her children
are older and the boundaries between her personal life and TV
persona seem more important to maintain. Cody and Cassidy Gifford
are 10 and 7 years old, respectively, and practically since birth
their every burp and boo-boo has been fodder for Gifford and
Philbin's breezy top-of-the-show banter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very thing that has made the show so successful _ host
chat _ is the thing that caused a real concern in my life that my
children be protected,'' explained Gifford, who has hinted at
retirement before _ though never so forcefully _ when contract
negotiations loomed.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin seemed to take the bombshell in stride, treating it
seriously while joking that he might not need a cohost at all once
Gifford leaves. He and Gifford have been paired together for 15
years, the last 12 in national syndication as the king and queen of
happy chat. There has been speculation that Joy Philbin, Regis's
wife and a perennial guest host on the show, might fill Gifford's
shoes if she ever did step down.
</P>
<P>
   However, according to general manager Mike Carson of WHDH-TV
(Ch. 7), which carries ``Live'' in Boston, the show's producers
informed him Tuesday that a search would be conducted for a new
cohost who would ``preserve the show's chemistry,'' in Carson's
words, but that no such selection had been made yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody seems terribly concerned,'' says Carson, ``which is not
to say Kathie Lee doesn't bring a special dimension to the show.
She does.''
</P>
<P>
   Gifford has also suffered her share of public travails in recent
years, one reason why she may have decided to lower her profile.
Her girl-next-door image was tarnished by revelations that a line
of designer clothes bearing her name was being manufactured under
sweatshop conditions, and that her husband, ABC sportscaster Frank
Gifford, had conducted an extramarital tryst, which was splashed
across the tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Philbin has seen his own star soar to unprecedented
heights _ one more reason why Gifford may sense the limelight
dimming on their partnership. As host of the phenomenally
successful ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' Philbin recently
signed a reported $20 million-a-year deal with ABC. Philbin and
Gifford have also substituted for David Letterman on CBS's ``Late
Show'' and Gifford has been starring on Broadway weekly in
``Putting It Together.'' There are also, of course, Gifford's
cruise ship commercials and Christmas specials, none of which is
dependent on Philbin for star support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Live'' remains a powerhouse ratings draw. With two days to go
in the current ratings book, according to Carson, the show is
averaging a 5.2 in Boston _ nearly double that of its nearest
competitor. Nationally the show is tied for fourth (with ``Montel
Williams'') among syndicated talk shows, trailing only those by
Oprah Winfrey, Jerry Springer, and Rosie O'Donnell.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Since the birth of the nation, religion has
influenced political campaigns but usually in indirect, underground
ways that are hard to quantify.
</P>
<P>
   In this primary season, however, religious tension is playing a
central role not seen since John F. Kennedy was forced to publicly
confront Protestant fears of his Catholicism during the 1960
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain
have all ostentatiously paraded their faith in God before various
audiences. Bush even cites Jesus Christ as his favorite political
philosopher. Only former Sen. Bill Bradley keeps his religious
views to himself.
</P>
<P>
   But the real religious crunch has come in the McCain-Bush
contest. Bush agents on the religious right are trying to paint
McCain as bigoted against Christian conservatives, and McCain
agents are trying to paint Bush as bigoted against Catholics. Up
front and out in the open, both claim the other is intolerant of
opposing views and biased against religious voters.
</P>
<P>
   After Ronald Reagan invited the Christian right into the
Republican Party in 1980 by backing constitutional amendments to
support school prayer and oppose abortion, the evangelical movement
swiftly came to dominate the GOP. Conservative Christians are now a
fourth to a third of party voters with even heavier concentrations
in some states.
</P>
<P>
   But Catholics were also attracted by Reagan's conservatism and
anti-communism. With Reagan gone, the coalition of Catholics and
born-again Christians is coming unglued, and now Catholics divide
their support almost equally between Republicans and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's task is to pry those voters away from Bush while still
appealing to independents and moderates who are put off by
religious zealots. Bush's task is to hold them without getting
pushed so far to the right that he cannot return to the middle in
the general election.
</P>
<P>
   McCain decided to go for broke when he attacked by name two
icons of the Christian right in their own home base of Virginia on
the eve of the state's GOP primary. ``Neither party should be
defined by pandering to the outer reaches of American politics and
the agents of intolerance whether they be Louis Farrakhan or Al
Sharpton on the left or Pat Robertson or Jerry Falwell on the
right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a brave speech, one that should have been made by all
presidential candidates of both parties long ago. It was a
politically defining moment that will have repercussions far beyond
this year's election returns. McCain is destined to make history
for breaking eggs whether he makes it to the White House or not.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, for his part, is on the defensive. No such vision of party
reformation for him. He apologized to New York Cardinal John
O'Connor for sending the wrong signal by appearing at Bob Jones
University without condemning its officials' anti-Catholic views.
In his apology, he lamely regretted not being ``more clear in
disassociating myself from (the) anti-Catholic sentiments and
racial prejudice'' of the school's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   More clear? At the university he didn't mention the subject at
all. Bush's problem is that he represents the status quo, which
does not encourage substantive distinctions between the bad and the
good in the party establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy became the first Catholic president because he
understood, as McCain does and Bush does not, that it was necessary
to tackle the religious issue directly and fearlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had been accused of being ``a captive of a system'' by
prominent Protestant clergymen. They claimed his church was
determined ``to breach the wall of separation of church and state''
and that his presidency would undermine the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy eloquently defended himself in a televised appearance
before them in Houston. He said, ``What kind of church I believe in
should be important only to me.'' He asked to be judged on his
record, not his religion. ``I do not speak for my church on public
matters, and the church does not speak for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy derailed the issue, but it did not entirely die. Three
hundred different anti-Catholic tracts were distributed to more
than 20 million homes. His opponent, Richard Nixon, kept the
subject alive by continually deploring religious bigotry. In the
end, defensive Catholics rallied to Kennedy, and Protestants proved
they were not bigots. But Kennedy's margin of victory was only a
half of a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy won because he convinced the country he would not dig a
tunnel to the Vatican. For McCain to win, he has to convince
Republicans that he will not throw the GOP baby out with the
religious bath water. In politics, there are limits.

EUROPEANS STILL NERVOUS ABOUT AUSTRIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Most of the European governments that diplomatically
isolated Austria when Joerg Haider's far-right Freedom Party gained
power last month said Tuesday that his resignation as party leader
has done nothing to ease their concerns about the party's extremist
views.
</P>
<P>
   If one of Haider's goals was to ease the barrage of diplomatic
sanctions and international condemnation aimed at Austria,
including the European Union's refusal to name Austrian officials
to international posts, there was no indication that would happen
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Many European leaders vowed to keep up the pressure on Austria,
saying they believed Haider's resignation Monday was a cynical ploy
and that he would continue to call the shots from the remote
province of Carinthia, where he is governor.
</P>
<P>
   Haider's domestic enemies were similarly defiant, vowing to
continue the weekly street protests in Vienna to demand the Freedom
Party's removal from government.
</P>
<P>
   From London to Berlin, from Lisbon to Brussels, the leaders of
the mostly left-of-center governments across Europe charged that
Haider still wants to be Austria's chancellor and that the
colleagues who assumed his party's leadership harbor xenophobic
sentiments that are antithetical to the European Union and its
plans to expand. Haider's sympathetic remarks about Nazis have also
caused alarm in capitals around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom Party wants to halt immigration and is skeptical
about expanding the 15-nation European Union to include eastern
European countries that border Austria. Capitalizing on
anti-immigrant sentiment in a country with the third-highest
percentage of foreigners in Europe, the party contends that
immigrants take jobs and commit a disproportionate amount of crime,
and say EU expansion will make the problems worse. Austria has one
of the lowest unemployment rates in the west, at 4.2 percent, and
is one of Europe's most affluent countries.
</P>
<P>
   Most European governments said they believe Haider's gesture was
purely tactical, intended to ease the international pressure aimed
at Austria since the Freedom Party formed a coalition with the
mainstream conservative People's Party. The controversy has
tarnished Austria's image and hurt its important tourist industry.
Some skiiers have stayed away from the Austrian Alps, and many
touring artists and celebrities have refused to perform in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The Portuguese government, which holds the presidency of the
European Union, said there is no immediate prospect of restoring
normal diplomatic relations with Austria.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is not Joerg Haider but what his party
represents,'' said Antonio Guterres, Portugal's prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Israel was similarly unimpressed, saying it will not allow its
ambassador to return to Vienna. He was recalled last month.
</P>
<P>
   In London, a Downing Street spokesman said that it still
considers the Freedom Party extremist, and that British Prime
Minister Tony Blair is concerned ``with policies, not
personalities.''
</P>
<P>
   In Berlin, a spokesman for the German foreign ministry said he
doubts Haider's move would be enough to lift the EU sanctions and
said the German government's position ``is unchanged.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Washington's sentiments are similar to
those voiced in European capitals. ``The EU statement is a pretty
good capturing of how we all feel right now,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgang Schuessel, the Austrian chancellor, praised Haider's
gesture as generous and pleaded for the European Union to give
Vienna's government a chance to prove it is not xenophobic and
opposed to EU expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I interpret it as a symbol that he wants to support this
government but also that he wants to take a personal responsibility
for easing the tensions with our partners in the EU,'' Schuessel
told reporters in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberto Dini, Italy's foreign minister, seemed to hint that his
country would be willing to see whether Austria would behave ``more
in sync with European Union objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we can see if we can establish normal relations with a
country that has been such a friend of Italy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vice Chancellor Susanne Riess-Passer, Haider's closest aide,
took over as party leader and said she is determined to prove that
``the prejudices against the Freedom Party are not justified.''

BACK TO BARGAINING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A dramatic step was taken on the path toward an Israeli-Syrian
peace agreement Sunday when Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak told
his Cabinet that Yitzhak Rabin, before his assassination in 1995,
had given conditional assurances to Syria that Israel would
withdraw completely from the Golan Heights as part of a
comprehensive peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's swiftly leaked disclosure was interpreted as a trial
balloon meant to prepare Israeli public opinion for the compromises
that will be necessary to forge a peace treaty with Syria. But
since Barak is committed to a referendum on any deal struck with
Syria's ruler, Hafez Assad, there can be no true gauge of public
opinion until Israelis are presented the actual terms of a
negotiated peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the primary effect of Barak's revelation is to signal that
Israel now acknowledges Syrian contentions about Rabin's
conditional offer and tacitly accepts Assad's demand that
bargaining begin where it left off five years ago. One implication
of this signal from Barak is that Assad no longer has any excuse
for refusing to talk nor any justification for allowing the
Hezbollah militia to expand military operations in southern
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   With this gesture of accommodation, Barak has invited Assad back
to the bargaining table. It is now up to the Syrian dictator to end
his boycott of the American-sponsored talks and to begin telling
Israel what kind of security arrangements he is willing to make on
the Golan and in southern Lebanon. Israel must have the means to
assure ample warning time of any attack from Syrian soil. Assad
also has to reveal what he proposes to do about water resources and
what degree of normalization he is ready to accept in trade and
cultural exchanges with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Henceforth a peace treaty is there for the taking. If Assad
truly wants peace with Israel, he can have it. He can have the
Golan Heights back and return to the lines of June 4, 1967,
provided that Syrian sovereignty does not reach to the shore of the
Sea of Galilee. Israel can have peace on all its borders provided
that it withdraws from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   This bargain, which may be struck this spring, suits the vital
interests of both countries.

STRAWBERRY COULDN'T SAY NO AND NEITHER COULD BASEBALL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB PADECKY   The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   c.2000
N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX, Ariz. _ Great musings always have entertained us in
baseball. What if Mickey Mantle had good knees and Sandy Koufax a
good elbow? What if Ted Williams hadn't fought in two wars and
Willie Mays didn't have to fight the wind at Candlestick Park? What
if the Negro Leagues didn't face racism?
</P>
<P>
   What if Darryl Strawberry put only a Kleenex to his nose?
</P>
<P>
   What if Strawberry hadn't been treated like a man of privilege?
</P>
<P>
   What if baseball had stopped playing the sucker to him?
</P>
<P>
   What if there hadn't been so many what ifs about Darryl
Strawberry?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he wouldn't be considered what he is today, a loser.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had incredible talent that transcended his age and his
team,'' said Giants general manager Brian Sabean. ``But maybe
everyone told the lie often enough that Darryl convinced himself
that it was the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the lie: Strawberry needed to stay in baseball to
become clean and sober; maybe that's the lie you have to tell when
you label a Los Angeles teen-ager the black Babe Ruth. The truth
is, however, a lie is a lie. It is one perpetuated even at this
very moment, as Strawberry was suspended Monday for the third time
in his career for substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Darryl needs baseball,'' said Yankee second baseman
Chuck Knoblauch, ``and I hope he gets to rehabilitate and he has
another chance (to play again).''
</P>
<P>
   The inference is, without baseball Strawberry's very life is in
danger.
</P>
<P>
   As if it's not now?
</P>
<P>
   As if baseball cleaned him up before?
</P>
<P>
   As if the game has been the sanctuary to make him whole again?
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch should look at it this way: Charisse Strawberry was
four months pregnant when her husband tested positive. Does
Knoblauch, or baseball for that matter, need a more telling example
of how dangerous Strawberry is to himself right now?
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry doesn't need baseball. He doesn't need the cocoon. He
doesn't need the fantasy world that a professional athlete
inhabits, one that has made Strawberry a well-known and easy mark
to every dealer in every American big city.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry needs reality. Strawberry needs to figure out why he
can't say no. In 1994, for example, he joined the Giants and was
given specific instructions. To simplify his life, Strawberry was
not to grant any one-on-one interviews, the desire for the media to
explore his problems would be never ending and distracting. He
needed to focus. Strawberry agreed. That instruction was repeated
the day before the Giants flew to New York to play the Mets,
Strawberry's old team.
</P>
<P>
   On the day he arrived at Shea Stadium, Strawberry was giving a
New York sportswriter a one-on-one interview. When a Giants
official asked Strawberry later why he did that, when he had just
agreed the day before he wouldn't, Strawberry replied, ``I didn't
want to hurt his feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't say no and neither could baseball. Strawberry was
given second chances because _ other than Ken Griffey Jr. _ no one
in baseball in the last 15 years had such a rhythmic swing. Others
generated as much power but watching Strawberry's whisk through the
strike zone was like melting butter. It just flowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always try to control,'' Sabean said, ``that which we
cannot.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's the lesson Darryl Strawberry has taught us. Try as
baseball did, as well-intentioned as the sport may have been, it
didn't help the black Babe Ruth become the black Babe Ruth. Maybe
no one could. We'll never know.
</P>
<P>
   What we do know is that Darryl Strawberry will never have
fulfilled his promise, even with 335 homers and 1,000 RBIs. Even
with the real possibility, as crazy as this sounds, that another
team, maybe even the Yankees, will employ him in 2001. Darryl
Strawberry always will be a song never completely sung.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Koufax and his elbow, we won't spend much time
deliciously reminiscing about Darryl and his nose. The man had
control of the pain this body part caused. Sandy didn't. That
doesn't leave us wistful. That leaves us with a sour taste in our
mouth, made all the more sour because the man had such a sweet
swing.

INVESTING IN NEWBORN CARE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   For a year now, newborn babies in Massachusetts have undergone a
sophisticated test that detects 30 inherited diseases. With early
intervention, many disorders can be stopped from developing or
their effects curbed. Without timely detection, some of the
disorders can kill or disable their victims.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is a pioneer in using tandem mass spectrometry to
screen for these conditions, many of which are related to the
child's metabolism. Yet while experience in Massachusetts shows the
benefits of such testing, it also shows why it must be teamed with
follow-up and counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Expense is one reason this testing is not done in more states.
Each full test costs $20 to $50, with the higher figure including
tracking and counseling. In Massachusetts, state law requires the
testing and follow-up, which insurers cover.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics argue that the money might be better spent on more
prenatal care or to make sure all pregnant women get enough of the
vitamin folic acid, lack of which causes birth defects. But early
detection can save lives and head off lifelong conditions that are
expensive to treat.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern: With some rare diseases, the technology used
for detection has outstripped understanding of how to deal with the
disorder. Elevated results ``will cause parental anxiety for
disorders that are not well defined at this time,'' says Dr. Roger
Eaton, director of UMass Medical School's New England Newborn
Screening Program.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, says Eaton, whose program does testing for
Massachusetts, some of this state's testing is still on a pilot
basis, with parents permitted to opt out of screening for several
disorders. But only 3 percent make that choice, he says.
</P>
<P>
   A task force from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the
federal Health Resources and Services Administration will advise
states later this year on whether to follow Massachusetts' lead. We
are generally skeptical of mandating health procedures by law. But
in this case, as long as the more extensive screening is combined
with follow-up and counseling, evidence shows it is a good
investment of the health-care dollar.

<P>
   Amtrak's ambitious plans to expand passenger rail service draw
on solid achievement and reflect growing confidence in the future
of rail travel.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak deserves continuing support from Congress as it offers
fresh hope for reaching its mandated balancing of operating costs
and revenues by the end of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion program is practical in concentrating on
relatively modest extensions of routes, more frequent service on
existing routes, and additions to Amtrak's specialty package
express service. It includes only one conspicuous initiative _ a
luxury New York-to-Los Angeles train designed to make the trip in
60 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Given the convenience, speed, and dependability of air travel,
Amtrak will never recapture the glory of American passenger
railroading, but it nevertheless remains an important part of the
overall long distance travel system. Some travelers do not care for
air travel, are unable or unwilling to drive, and are averse to bus
travel. Amtrak offers service to more than 500 communities in 45
states to accommodate this traffic.
</P>
<P>
   In heavily traveled corridors like those serving Boston, New
York, and Washington, Amtrak is highly competitive with all other
forms of travel. It is improving its service steadily, most notably
with the recent electrification of the New Haven-Boston stretch and
impending arrival of high-speed, high-tech trains. Similar gains
are being made in about 10 other major corridors around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Money remains a problem. Amtrak has yet to break even, much less
turn a profit. The expansion plans in all cases are designed to add
revenue _ a sensible approach given the prospective loss of
operating subsidies starting in fiscal 2003.
</P>
<P>
   That is an important target for Amtrak to hit, in order to
cement its credibility with a Congress sometimes skeptical about
ever seeing an end to deficits. Congress, in turn, will serve the
nation's interest by continuing to fund improved equipment for a
system that is indispensable for millions of travelers every year.

HOME MANAGEMENT EXPERT TEACHES ORGANIZATION, NOT OBSESSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 Star-Banner, Ocala, Fla.  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If it's any comfort, Deniece Schofield says she hasn't always
been this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was once a very disorganized person,'' said Schofield, who
has since been identified by Publishers Weekly as possibly ``the
most organized person on earth.'' She quickly adds that getting her
life in order wasn't a choice. It was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Schofield, who is now a home management expert, travels around
the country sharing her insights on how she learned to be more
organized.
</P>
<P>
   Her books include: ``Confessions of a Happily Organized
Family,'' ``Confessions of an Organized Homemaker,'' ``Kitchen
Organization Tips and Secrets,'' and ``Springing The Time Trap.''
She is a regular contributor to Woman's Day magazine, and has made
appearances throughout the United States and Canada on television
and radio programs.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't careful planning that led Schofield to change her
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was out of sheer desperation. I had hit rock bottom after
the birth of my third child,'' said Schofield, speaking of the time
her children were 4, 2 and newborn. ``It just seems like there were
always wet clothes on the floor, or toys on the floor, or dishes in
the sink,'' she said, sighing. ``Enough was enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Schofield said the next step she took was a crucial one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just sat down and wrote out a list of everything I could
think of,'' she said. ``Once I wrote it down, it relieved some of
the pressure. I just knew that there was no way that I could stay
like that.'' This was 1974 and there weren't many professional
organizers back then. ``There was a lot of trial and error to find
out what would work for me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Changes she made included scheduling laundry days and
encouraging her children to play with one toy at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seemed that there was always laundry, and always
clothes which had to be washed, folded, ironed or put away. It
seemed like there was never a day without laundry.'' Her solution
was to dedicate Monday, Wednesday and Friday with an optional
Saturday to laundry. ``And it worked. At least we were better able
to stay on top of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Schofield adeptly balances being a wife, mother of five,
and grandmother of four with a busy career as an author and
motivational speaker on a topic that near and dear to her heart.
She mostly advises people to pause to think before acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cringe every time I hear someone say after my seminar
they're going out to buy some new containers,'' Schofield said.
``First, you should make sure you'll know what you'll do with them,
and if you even have space for them. I always tell people to slow
down, and make do with what you have before going out to buy all
that stuff.'' After all, she said, containers can cause more
clutter.
</P>
<P>
   Schofield laughs at some gadgets she has seen such as an
electric butter dispenser with attachments that allowed it to
spray, brush or squirt butter. Another device could put butter and
salt on corn on the cob at the same time. ``These are just
ridiculous and unnecessary,'' she said
</P>
<P>
   What does it mean to be organized?
</P>
<P>
   `` I wanted to be able to nurture my family and manage my home,
and yet still have time and energy to pursue interests,'' she said.
``That was my goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Schofield acknowledges that different people have different
ideas on the meaning of being organized. ``Choose the level of
organization that comfortable for you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, organization can go too far. Schofield knows of one woman
who displays a bronze sign on her door directing people to remove
their shoes before entering her home. Another example is the woman
who flips her throw rug upside down just to save it for when ``good
company'' comes. ``Now this is extreme,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons people hold on to clutter can be more than
superficial. ``In some cases, people need a doctor and not an
organizer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled how one friend found help by attending Al-A-Non
meetings even though she had no problems with alcohol or drugs. She
recognized that not being able to rid herself of clutter was also
an addictive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are afraid to throw things away because they
think they'll want it back one day. But it's selfish to keep
them,'' Schofield said, suggesting that these stored items could be
put to better use by someone who will use them. ``Why not donate to
a charity, and give to someone who will appreciate it. This makes
it easier to let go of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Schofield maintains a busy speaking engagement
calendar, her husband of 30 years said he admires how his wife is
able to keep her priorities in order.
</P>
<P>
   ``She lets me and our children know that we are important to
her,'' Jim Schofield said. He considers his wife his best friend.
``She makes our home my most favorite place to be, and not too many
husbands can say that.''

THE AGONY OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AT THE OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ABBY ELLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After her husband smashed the liquor bottle over her head, after
the blood dried and her two young sons stopped crying, Rosa
Schirripa realized the marriage was over. Although she got
emotional support from her friends, she was afraid to approach the
one person who might have given her the most practical help: her
boss.
</P>
<P>
   She said she feared that he would view her as weak or stupid for
staying with her husband for so long and that he would try to get
rid of her. Eventually she did talk to him and, to her surprise, he
gave her a few days off, at his convenience. Before that talk,
however, she felt she had nowhere to turn for advice and
protection. Instead, she spent a lot of time sobbing in the office
bathroom and asked her colleagues to cover for her when the divorce
lawyers called. Anything so her boss would not know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't tell him what was happening,'' Schirripa, a
38-year-old New Yorker, said of her ordeal, which ended in divorce
two years ago. ``I know of people who stay in abusive relationships
because they're afraid to go to their boss. They're afraid of the
stigma, afraid that they'll be replaced.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude appears to be changing, though, as more companies
become aware of how domestic abuse affects workplace morale and
productivity, and as more cities and states consider legislation to
protect victims against discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, only a handful of companies in the United States
had formal policies to help employees deal with domestic violence,
but today hundreds do, said Donna Norton, manager of the Workplace
Resource Center in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The Philip Morris Companies, with 57,000 employees, has been
active in the campaign for greater awareness of the problem,
holding workshops and conferences around the country. Last spring,
it joined with Liz Claiborne Inc., American Express Co. and Bell
Atlantic Corp. to sponsor Safe at Work, a coalition of companies,
labor unions and government agencies that seeks to spread the word
about domestic violence and its effect on the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   A number of state and local governments have also taken action.
Since 1998, Rhode Island and California have enacted laws
prohibiting employers from terminating employees who take time off
to get restraining orders against abusive partners. Similar
legislation is pending in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Maine and Dade County, Fla., enacted legislation last year to
provide unpaid leave for domestic violence victims. Ten states,
including California, Connecticut, New York and New Jersey,
recently passed legislation making victims eligible for
unemployment insurance if they lose their jobs. Mark Green, New
York City's public advocate, says he plans to introduce a bill soon
to broaden the rights of city employees in the event of domestic
violence.
</P>
<P>
   When it becomes known that employers cannot retaliate, ``more
women will come forward,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic violence is probably a greater drain on productivity
than most employers realize. Ten years ago, the Bureau of National
Affairs, a private company that monitors workplace trends,
estimated the cost of domestic violence in lost output at $3
billion to $5 billion a year. And a study commissioned by Liz
Claiborne in 1994 estimated that family disputes, including
domestic violence, kept a million Americans off the job every day.
Last year, Victim Services, a nonprofit assistance agency in New
York, received 95,000 calls from women who needed help because of
abusive partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the callers talk about issues at work, because for
women that's a prime place where domestic violence happens,'' said
Bea Hanson, a director at Victim Services. ``We get calls from
women who are being stalked by their boyfriend or husband at their
job, or they've gotten repeat phone calls that prevent them from
focusing on their work. We get calls from women whose partners come
in unannounced and demand they leave. Most women don't feel safe to
talk about this issue at work, so it's important for women to know
they can disclose this information and not lose their job.''
</P>
<P>
   That sort of uncertainty once haunted Brooke McMurray. McMurray,
a vice chairwoman of Victim Services, worked at Time Inc. for more
than 20 years before leaving in January. She was in an abusive
relationship for 12 of those years, she says, but never sought help
at work. ``You didn't talk about it then,'' said McMurray, who is
50 and, like the other women interviewed for this article, provided
corroborative evidence of the abuse they described. ``I was afraid
to tell my boss for fear he'd fire me,'' she said. ``The guy
operating the freight elevators was the only one I told,'' and that
was because she used the freight elevator for years when her
husband used to wait in the lobby for her. Time Inc. does not have
a formal domestic-violence policy, a spokesman said, but it does
now have an employee-assistance program that can help victims.
</P>
<P>
   Such a self-imposed wall of silence as McMurray's can come
tumbling down at a company that advertises its eagerness to help
people in her predicament. Janice Munson, a Philip Morris employee
in upstate New York, says the company's policy helped save her
sanity. Shortly after joining Philip Morris in 1990, she was
divorced. Abusive calls and letters kept coming in, she says, but
in the open atmosphere at Philip Morris she was able for the first
time to talk to her superiors about her plight and to get help. She
was encouraged to provide a description of her former husband to
the security desk. She even got the mailroom to throw out letters
from him so she wouldn't have to see them.
</P>
<P>
   Schirripa, the woman who was hit over the head with a liquor
bottle, is now a full-time administrative assistant at the College
of Staten Island and is taking courses in social work there. She
also works part time in Green's office as an advocate for more
enlightened workplace policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the employer give the employee a chance, let her get on
her own two feet,'' Schirripa said. Unpaid leaves are a big help,
she said. Speaking for victims of violence, she added: ``I'm not
even asking for pay. I'll lose the money, but if I lose my job I
lose my lifeline.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The lined note paper is covered in tightly spaced
German script, in blue ink. Meticulous diagrams of the Nazi
hierarchy are neatly labeled. And every one of the 678 pages of the
final draft are signed by the author, Adolf Eichmann.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was efficient, horrendously efficient,'' said Professor
Evyatar Friesel, the state archivist of Israel, as he showed the
last memoirs of Eichmann in his office Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Locked away for nearly 40 years, the manuscript was made public
Tuesday by the Israeli government as evidence in a Holocaust denial
trial in London.
</P>
<P>
   Eichmann, who organized the deportation of millions of Jews to
death camps during World War II, wrote the memoirs in an Israeli
jail in the summer of 1961 after Israeli agents seized him in
Argentina and brought him to trial in Jerusalem. He was hanged in
1962.
</P>
<P>
   For hours a day over a period of four months, Eichmann sat at a
small table in his jail cell and laboriously penned 1,300 pages of
an autobiographical narrative and philosophical ruminations that he
apparently intended to give the court and ultimately publish as a
book. The work is titled ``The False Gods,'' a reference to the
Nazis, and includes such detailed instructions as a request that
the book's jacket-cover be pearl-colored or dove gray.
</P>
<P>
   The manuscript, which includes drafts, diagrams and footnotes,
recounts at length Eichmann's defense in his trial: that he was no
more than a cog in the Nazi machine. Asserting that he was not
anti-Semitic but misguidedly drawn to the nationalist ethos of
Nazism, he portrays himself as an official with limited authority
who was simply following orders. One of his diagrams shows him at
the bottom of the pyramid of the Nazi hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man was fighting for his life,'' Friesel said.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical passage, Eichmann writes: ``It is normal that I who
was not responsible, was not the master planner, the initiator or
the one giving orders, should set out to defend myself against
these accusations.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``My position is the same as that of millions of
others who had to obey. The difference is simply that I had a much
more difficult task to perform in carrying out my orders.''
</P>
<P>
   In another passage, Eichmann wrote: ``I was obedient to the
leadership of the German state, because we were told and believed
that Germany had enemies intent on destroying it. The enemy's
determination to destroy us, despite the madness of our own
leadership at the time, weighed on my conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Eichmann wrote, the Nazis brought on ``the greatest
and most violent dance of death of all time,'' ruining Germany.
</P>
<P>
   After Gideon Hausner, the prosecutor in the Eichmann trial,
cautioned that publication of the memoirs could compete with the
verdict, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion ordered the manuscript
locked away for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was not reviewed and the document remained under
lock and key despite a surge of public interest in the manuscript
in the past year. Friesel said that legal questions about ownership
and copyright prevented publication. Eichmann's son, Dieter
Eichmann, demanded that Israel hand over his father's notes,
arguing that they are his rightful inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   There were also concerns about the impact of publication on
perceptions of the Holocaust. An Israeli panel decided last summer
to release the memoirs, but in an annotated scholarly edition that
would, it was hoped, put Eichmann's assertions in perspective and
prevent their use to discredit the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   That process, which could have taken years, was hampered by
technical difficulties. In the end it was decided to make the
memoirs public immediately, after a request for the manuscript was
made by defense lawyers in a libel suit brought in London by the
historian David Irving against Deborah Lipstadt, an American
professor.
</P>
<P>
   Irving sued Lipstadt and Penguin Books for a book that called
him ``a dangerous spokesman for Holocaust denial.'' Lipstadt's
lawyers plan to submit Eichmann's memoirs, which describe the
deportation and mass killing of Jews, as evidence of the Nazi
genocide. Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein said that Israel, as
the Jewish state, was obliged to make the material public.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the manuscript has been sent to London, while a
photocopy and typed versions of the text in the original German
were made available at the Israel State Archives in Jerusalem. A
copy is also expected to be sent to Dieter Eichmann.

 &HT;    Community policing `New Cop' doesn't show innovation
 &HT;    By Lou Grieco
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine a police force in which recruits must study child
development, where ranking officers can study clinical psychology
at Yale, and where any officer must surrender his pager number to
any citizen who requests it.
</P>
<P>
   They're doing that in New Haven, Conn., where a 10-year
experiment in community policing is still under way. New Cop on the
Beat a one-hour PBS documentary airing at 10 tonight, shows a
little about what New Haven is doing but skimps on some key
information.
</P>
<P>
   Community policing, of course, is nothing new. Some experts
consider it a throwback to when officers walked a beat. Others see
it as a chance to build new, creative partnerships with the
community and other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   What community policing has become in the 1990s is a buzzword.
Both Dayton police and the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office have
assigned ``community-based'' officers to work specific
neighborhoods in recent years. New Haven is going further. All of
the department's 417 officers are trained in community policing.
All of the 11 substations have ``community rooms'' with computers
and kitchens, which people are encouraged to use for programs and
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the partnerships. There's one with the school
board, which places an officer in each of the city's high schools.
There's one with the Yale University Child Study Center, where the
officers learn about child development and psychology. Another
partnership is with the local drug court, in which an officer works
with other officials choosing and monitoring which drug-addicted
criminals will be sent for rehabilitation instead of prison.
</P>
<P>
   New Cop backs this up with plenty of documentary footage, mostly
of friendly cops patiently explaining things to minor criminals.
``The minute you come on like a madman or you talk down to them,
well, now they're saying `This guy's looking at me like a piece of
trash,''' one officer explains.
</P>
<P>
   Makes sense. But while there's no doubt New Haven is doing some
innovative things, the documentary does little to show either the
effects or the costs of this 10-year direction.
</P>
<P>
   No detractors are quoted. No dollar figures for training are
offered. No discussion is shown of response-time rates, or of
whether the ``partnerships'' take officers from other important
duties. No statistical evidence is offered that community policing
works, or has any impact at all.
</P>
<P>
   Only one filmed annecdote suggests it does. A suspect doesn't
want to go to jail, so he kicks out a cruiser window. Police pull
him back out, and a crowd forms. Some from the crowd urge the
suspect to behave.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards one cop says it would have been different 10 years
earlier, that the crowd would have turned on the cops.
</P>
<P>
   That's it for results.
</P>
<P>
   Community policing principles are shaping police work
nationwide, including locally. It's an intriguing concept with a
lot to offer. But any new direction in policing, arguably the most
important function our governments undertake, should face tough
questions. New Cop doesn't even ask.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ After wasting millions of dollars and bloodying
each other's noses over religion, reform and who's the real Reagan
Republican, John McCain and George W. Bush are blowing off Ronald
Reagan's home state.
</P>
<P>
   Following months of public appearances and debates in the weird
and puny states of New Hampshire and South Carolina, the Republican
candidates for president are giving California a week of
trickle-down campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three months, Bush has spent all of one day in
California. McCain has spent more time here (the Arizona senator
always says, ``I like to visit my water''), and he is taking his
bus tour through the Central Valley this week.
</P>
<P>
   The polls say McCain can't carry California Republicans on March
7, but he's close in New York. Thus, we'll be hearing a lot about
New York issues like _ what? _ Hillary Rodham Clinton, Rudolph
Giuliani and the right of policemen to empty their handguns when
threatened by black people brandishing loaded wallets.
</P>
<P>
   California may be more representative of new American realities
than New York, but who says this Republican primary is about
reality?
</P>
<P>
   This is a race in which Bush thought he could make a big
symbolic statement to South Carolina fundamentalists by speaking at
the racist, anti-Catholic Bob Jones University, and yet he thought
that wouldn't make a big symbolic statement elsewhere in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bush took 24 days to admit he made a mistake. If he runs
the country the way he does his campaign, don't expect high
intelligence or quick decisions on anything.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McCain is pounding Bush for his links to right-wing
fundamentalists, which ought to play well in New York and much of
California. But what was McCain thinking when he tried to say he
only uses the word ``gook'' about his North Vietnamese captors and
not Asians in general?
</P>
<P>
   It's reminiscent of racist Southerners who used to say that only
certain African-Americans deserved to be called by the N-word.
Sorry, it doesn't cut it.
</P>
<P>
   We need to see these guys in action, not just in their stump
speeches and rehearsed town meetings. A lot of us really want to
see if McCain is as much of a hothead as he seems, or if Bush is as
inarticulate as he sounds in sound bites, which get caught in his
throat so badly they call for sound Heimlichs.
</P>
<P>
   Last week he tied his tongue in knots about the Bob Jones
University disaster, accidentally saying he was against interracial
dating, when he meant he was against the college's ban on
interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
   When he tried to say the word ``bigotry'' it came out
``bigocy.'' As in big idiocy.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing the pattern of self-destruction it established with
the Clinton impeachment obsession, the Republican Party
establishment still backs Bush.
</P>
<P>
   If the guy were a stock, they would have unloaded him weeks ago.
They invested $70 million in Boy George, whose resume would fit on
a post-it note, and he's already spent most of the money losing New
Hampshire and winning a Pyrrhic victory in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   McCain irritates the GOP establishment, so it undercuts him
every chance it gets, even though he's the one guy who can beat Al
Gore in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   So the question for Democrats, including those of us who
re-registered as Republicans for the California primary, is how do
we help the Republican Party destroy itself?
</P>
<P>
   Why not be a little vengeful and cast a negative vote? After
all, Republicans in Congress wasted years of our time trying to
destroy a popular Democratic president.
</P>
<P>
   When I registered as a Republican a few weeks ago, my idea was
to vote against the party-anointed nonentity who spoke at a bigoted
college and still thought he could be president.
</P>
<P>
   McCain isn't all that different in his conservative philosophy
than Bush. They believe that women have no right to abortion, that
gays are second-class citizens and that trillions should be spent
on hare-brained schemes to shoot rockets out of the sky. The idea
was just to vote against Bush, not for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed. Now it looks like I'll have to vote for Boy
George. He has one clear advantage over McCain. Gore can beat him
like a set of bongos.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe my wife and I will just cancel out each other's votes.
Being a Republican is hard work, almost as hard as being a Democrat
was in 1972, when the idea was to lose big with another George,
that McGovern guy.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As you savor your tuna tartare in an elegant dining
room, your companion may not be the only one to notice you are
ignoring the sesame toasts the chef has made to accompany it. The
chef may be fretting about it, too, while he observes you on a
video screen in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   As you blithely eat your meal, he may be watching for the moment
you put your fork down, so he can get your next course rolling. You
may never know it, unless you spot the cookie-size lens of the
camera above your table.
</P>
<P>
   Even in restaurants that have not invested in video technology,
your name, phone number, address and even where you work may be
stored away on a computer hard drive without your knowledge.
Computers have been in restaurants for years, but until recently
they were mainly used to convey orders from the dining room to the
kitchen. Now, they can track how much wine you drink, how often you
order the foie gras, how much you tip and how many times you didn't
show up for a reservation.
</P>
<P>
   In a city where people prize anonymity almost more than fame,
restaurants are increasingly adding surveillance and information
gathering to their functions. Chefs and restaurateurs say that the
better they know their customers, the better they can serve them,
monitoring the pace of a meal, for example, or always
``remembering'' to deliver your martini with olives rather than
onions.
</P>
<P>
   But restaurateurs are not exactly boasting about their new
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras at Daniel are an open secret in the restaurant
world, though most diners are unaware of them. In 1993, Daniel
Boulud installed them around the dining room at the former Daniel,
now Cafe Boulud. They are still up and running, and he has
installed a video system in the new Daniel as well, where the
monitors are in plain view for any visitor to the kitchen. Although
Boulud did not return calls to discuss them, his publicist,
Georgette Farkas, said the system is essential. ``He can keep an
eye on the front of the house and the kitchen at the same time,''
Farkas said.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras are positioned around the dining room and capture
three to four tables each. In the kitchen, Boulud has several
screens set up next to his station, so that at a glance he can
switch from viewing the employee locker room to seeing how a table
is progressing on its first course.
</P>
<P>
   At Aureole Las Vegas, Charlie Palmer, the chef, said he
installed a video system to keep track of all that goes on in the
restaurant, which is much larger than Aureole in New York. His
system is more advanced than the one at Daniel: 16 cameras are
positioned around the dining rooms. The image quality is nearly as
good as a television screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can zoom and see they're almost done with the first
course, actually zoom in and see the plates,'' Palmer said. Though
they are essentially surveillance cameras, the clarity is good
enough, he said, that you can tell, ``if the fork's on the plate.''
Or if a celebrity is misbehaving with a date, as Palmer said he and
a few cooks observed on a recent evening.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Stech-Novak, a kitchen designer, is installing cameras in
the Roy's restaurants around the country, starting with the new
Roy's in San Francisco, which is to open in July.
</P>
<P>
   Rocco DiSpirito, the chef at Union Pacific, expects to have
video cameras installed there by this summer. The newer digital
cameras will be clearer than the others, and have better zooming
capability and remote access _ which means that if DiSpirito goes
on vacation he can log on to his computer, and look into the dining
room.
</P>
<P>
   Though just a very few restaurants have invested in cameras for
their dining rooms _ a system costs $15,000 to $100,000,
Stech-Novak said _ many, many more are using their reservations
computers to monitor their clientele. New software allows
restaurants to build a much larger and more detailed database _ and
offers them countless ways to use the information.
</P>
<P>
   Credit card companies also gather information for restaurants.
American Express, for instance, can come up with lists of card
members who spend above a given amount, or card members who dine
frequently in a particular restaurant. Then, that restaurant can,
through a third party, send an offer to these card members, either
in their credit card statement or in a restaurant newsletter. The
Diners Club card provides similar services to restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, keeping close tabs on the customers is not just the
result of new technology. Good restaurants have always been savvy
about recalling the drinks or tables that regulars like.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at Oceana in Midtown, Felix Marrufo, the captain,
keeps a detailed black book. For one man, there is ``menu
immediately, Pellegrino, likes Maine oysters, no mignonette,
elderly man with young Asian companion.'' For another, it's ``tap
water, espresso, rush.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the restaurant is entering Marrufo's notes into a computer
database, so all of its employees will know diners almost as well
as he does.
</P>
<P>
   Some restaurants are buying software like RSViP and Perfect
Host, specifically designed to handle reservations, and using it to
track customers. But many more are joining one of the new online
reservations services, which provide the software as part of the
package, even if the restaurant has not gone online. Oceana, for
example, is using the software supplied by OpenTable.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary value is definitely the database and being able to
record the history of your guests _ no question,'' said Paul
McLaughlin, the restaurant's general manager.
</P>
<P>
   All the software works essentially the same way: when diners
call or go online to make a reservation, they are added to the
database, with their telephone numbers and any other information
they share. On some programs, each diner's file has categories for
address, e-mail address, food preferences, date of first visit,
profession, favorite server and V.I.P. status.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many restaurants out there,'' said Massimo
Felici, the owner of La Nonna in Manhattan, who uses software from
Foodline.com to track patrons. ``You don't want to lose any
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The software helps in other ways, too: It allows restaurants to
track patrons who do not honor reservations. A reservationist might
not recognize a no-show's name, but databases do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have to squeeze you in on a booked Saturday night and I
see that you didn't come in when you made a reservation, I'll give
that table to another customer,'' Felici said.
</P>
<P>
   Some online reservation programs, like OpenTable.com, have more
elaborate no-show features: the program counts your no-shows, and
if you reach three, sends you an e-mail. The idea, said Andy
England, OpenTable's vice president for marketing, is to shame the
diner into changing his ways.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Hanson, an owner of several Manhattan restaurants,
including Ruby Foo's Dim Sum and Sushi Palace and the Blue Water
Grill, uses Perfect Host to integrate information from all his
restaurants, so that if you are a regular at Blue Water Grill, and
go to Atlantic Grill, another of his restaurants, you'll be treated
like a regular there, too. If you're not a regular, you will also
be marked.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   When Marshall Goldberg, a senior director for housing of Project
Return, a social services group in Manhattan, tried to make a
reservation at Ruby Foo's on the Upper West Side a few months ago,
the reservationist asked for his phone number. Goldberg gave him
the number.
</P>
<P>
   A moment passed, and he was told he was not in their system.
When Goldberg asked what would have happened had he been, the
reservationist informed him that it would have shown his rating,
and that had his rating been high enough, they might have been able
to take care of him.
</P>
<P>
   Hanson denies rating his customers, although his system does
keep a count of the number of times a diner has visited. ``This was
just an uninformed host,'' he said. ``We were obviously full. If it
had been a regular customer who comes in all the time, I would have
wanted a manager to see if they could find a way for him to get
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Danny Meyer, a restaurateur who is known for personal service,
has installed software from OpenTable.com at Eleven Madison Park.
Eventually, it will be installed in his other restaurants _ Union
Square Cafe, Tabla and Gramercy Tavern _ said Nick Mautone, the
general manager of Gramercy Tavern.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a regular at Eleven Madison Park and you're put on the
waiting list, Meyer said, ``I would absolutely want to see it help
you on the wait list.'' He added that a new feature of the software
will soon allow him to organize the wait list based on customer
profiles _ for instance, to keep a 50-50 balance between new and
returning customers.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   At Jean Georges, the Perfect Host software allows the restaurant
to print up a card for each party coming in that day. On it are the
name of the host, table number, number in the party and any
important notes on the diner who made the reservation. When the
host arrives, a staff member records on the card a symbol for the
person's sex and attire and sends the customer to the bar. The
captain is then given the card and is able to identify the person
at the bar without having to ask his (or her) name a second time.
There are other notes, too, like ``likes small table'' or ``wine
connoisseur.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, Ken Yeh, a vice president at Christie's who
advises Asian clients, went to Jean Georges for dinner. His card
reads: ``Super regular customer at JoJo. Was in JG for tasting menu
on Monday night this week. Third visit in 10 days for Yeh.'' (It
also noted him as a ``PPX,'' which is a restaurant term for V.I.P.)
</P>
<P>
   ``That's quite amazing,'' Yeh said when he was read his
restaurant dossier. Though astonished at the detail, Yeh said he
wasn't offended. But it did lead him to reminisce about the years
when he dined on long tasting menus at the former Bouley in
TriBeCa, which were customized so that no course was ever repeated.
There was no computer to keep tabs.
</P>
<P>
   While most restaurants are subtle in how they gather their
information, some are aggressive. The Kimpton Restaurant Group,
which owns restaurants around the country, including Mossant Bistro
in Chicago and the Grand Cafe in San Francisco, gives servers a
form for collecting information on guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no expectation they have to fill it out,'' said
Andrew Freeman, a public relations representative for the group.
``They can write down the name, the table they were at and whatever
you get on them.'' That might include what wine you drank or where
you work. Then the information is entered into the computer. ``It
gives us the opportunity to personalize almost every guest
experience,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Or to be a little nosy.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants have always thrived on the see-and-be-seen appeal.
At the Brasserie in Midtown, a camera is placed at the door so that
images of entering diners are transmitted to screens above the bar
for all to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was all part of the design elements that the architects
wanted, because they see dining as a voyeuristic experience,'' said
Dana Madigan, the general manager.
</P>
<P>
   But being watched from the kitchen with a hidden camera is
colder, more efficient and sneakier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the great part of the whole dining experience is
intimacy, and that blows it,'' said Drew Nieporent, an owner of
Nobu, Montrachet and other restaurants in New York. ``If you know
there's going to be a camera anywhere in the restaurant, the next
thing is going to be a microphone under the table, and that's not
fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Chefs like Palmer of Aureole and DiSpirito of Union Pacific
defend the use of cameras as a practical measure to get around
unreliable servers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the same as the chef being able to flick a switch and
verify himself that it's time to fire the foie gras, bake the
souffle or whatever,'' said Stech-Novak, the owner of Mark
Stech-Novak Restaurant Consultation and Design in Oakland, Calif.
``You can't rely on people's words. A picture is worth a thousand
words.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Roy Yamaguchi, the chef and owner of Roy's restaurants, is
considering cameras not just to monitor the dining room, but also
to allow chefs in one restaurant to show others at another location
in the chain how to prepare new dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Dpon Netmedia, a company in Houston that makes digital
monitoring systems that can be linked to the Internet, has recently
begun marketing them to restaurants. With its system, a chef can
move the cameras and zoom in closely. Very closely. Mark Kelley,
the sales director, said a camera 10 feet above a table can zoom in
close enough to see the writing on a check.
</P>
<P>
   The images, which show up on a computer screen placed in the
kitchen, can be saved, and if the chef is away from the restaurant,
he can log on and see what is going on in the dining room, kitchen
or wherever the cameras are pointed.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Yeh, the owner of the company (and no relation to Ken Yeh),
said restaurants could also set up Web sites and allow real-time
viewing of the dining room or kitchen on the Internet. It's a
possibility that makes sharing an evening on a restaurant's kitchen
monitor seem private in comparison.
</P>
<P>
   This is the system that Union Pacific plans to install this
summer. DiSpirito estimates that cameras will increase the
restaurant's efficiency by 35 to 40 percent. By being able to see
how a table's meal is progressing without waiting for a server to
tell him, he said, he can keep the meal better timed. DiSpirito
added he can avoid delays, such as when a waiter forgets to set
down the proper flatware, and the kitchen has to wait before
sending out the food.
</P>
<P>
   But if the cooks have an eye on your table, who's watching the
fish on the burner? So far, no one has invented that technology.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you order the plate of warm cookies at Thalia and
ask for a glass of warm milk to go with it, the waiter doesn't
snicker. The quintessential kids' dessert is presented with all the
pomp and ceremony usually reserved for the Triple Chocolate
Overload with Banyuls, a port-like French wine. Maybe more. It's
delivered with a solicitousness that a souffle never inspires, with
an almost palpable understanding that when you request the ultimate
kids' comfort food, it has to be done to your very specific
childhood satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   And lately, more diners are regressing at the end of dinner. In
the city's most sophisticated restaurants, meals that might have
closed with creme brulee or profiteroles are being polished off
with cookies and milk. You see fashionable women at Le Cirque 2000
ordering tall glasses of skim milk to drink with the tray of petits
fours. There are the thick chocolate chunk cookies being dunked in
whole milk by the club kids at Moomba. Some restaurants like
Tapika, Heartbeat and the Lenox Room have just given up and put the
combination ``cookies and milk'' on the dessert menu.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Atlas. The cookies arrive on a large white
plate, a selection that includes oatmeal-cranberry, white chocolate
macadamia bars and iced sugar cookies. The milk is presented like a
fine wine, still sealed in its container: a small school-lunch
carton of whole or chocolate. It is poured tableside and garnished
with two paper-wrapped straws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the presentation would be fun,'' said James Danos,
the general manager at Atlas. ``We didn't really expect anyone to
drink the milk, but it turns out that they are.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, diners are ordering milk with the finickiness normally
reserved for double-decaf-skim lattes. Should it be whole or skim?
Warm or ice cold? A tall glass or a short one? Cow or goat?
</P>
<P>
   ``We started doing cookies and milk as something for children,''
said George McKirdy, the pastry chef at Heartbeat, who offers
organic goat's milk with his cookie plate. ``But we find that it's
the adults who are ordering it.''
</P>
<P>
   And many of them have issues about it, too. Just listen to
Jeffrey Banks, the men's wear designer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father always ordered milk when I was growing up,'' he
said. ``But it had to be really, really cold. Sometimes, he would
order a glass of milk, and then a glass of ice on the side. He'd
pour the milk into the ice to chill it down, then pour that very
cold milk back into the milk glass. That's part of what I love
about ordering milk. It's just so homey in a Mommy and Daddy way.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Baum, a partner in the B.E. Group of restaurants and a
restaurant consultant, dines out almost every night. After a
complicated meal, he said, cookies and milk are almost a relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have many decisions to make: first there is a choice of
cocktails or an apertif, then you have to read the menu and discuss
the wine list with the captain,'' he said. ``At the same time you
are socializing and are stimulated by the decor and what's going on
around you and, of course, by the food. It's exhausting. By the
time you get to dessert, all I usually want is a hammock to lie
down in and take a break from all that intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   He drinks skim.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants seem to understand this need for coddling. Dunking
is precisely the point of many cookie-and-milk combinations, where
there is too little liquid for serious drinking but just enough for
dipping. At the Lenox Room, the milk comes in a shallow coffee cup
rather than a glass. Tapika serves it in an oversize shot glass
garnished with slim chocolate curls. At Atlas, of course, they're
careful to pour the milk into a wide-mouth ``rocks'' glass.
</P>
<P>
   Although Union Square Cafe doesn't pair its cookie plate with
milk, the manager, Mark Maynard-Parisi, has noticed more people
ordering it on their own. On most nights the cafe sells only a
glass or two; last Sunday it sold eight. ``We usually suggest that
people order a glass of dessert wine with the cookie plate,'' he
said. ``But it looks like milk is getting popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Hort, a sales representative at a printing company who eats
out six nights a week, is one of those milk orderers. ``I order
milk everywhere I go, including all the best places,'' he said.
``For me, it's not worth eating the cookies unless I can wash them
down with a glass of milk.''
</P>
<P>
   It also seems that the later it gets, the more likely people
long for childish pleasures. At 3:30 a.m. at Moomba recently, the
crowd was thinning and the last tables languidly finishing their
martinis, cosmopolitans _ and cookie plates, served with that
age-old night-cap, a glass of milk. Moomba's warm chocolate chunk
cookies are among the best of their kind: thick, soft in the center
and densely packed with Callebaut chocolate chunks. Not far away,
at Grace, a new restaurant and bar in TriBeCa, most of the requests
for milk with the cookie plate are a late-night thing, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always hoping that people will order a really nice Cognac
or single malt Scotch or glass of port with their cookies,'' said
Fred McKibbin, the restaurant's owner and cookie maker, ``but late
at night they go for the nostalgic kid thing.''

<P>
   1. To make praline powder, place nuts on a nonstick or lightly
oiled baking sheet. In a small heavy saucepan combine } cup sugar
and \ cup water, and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring
constantly until sugar dissolves. Increase heat to medium-high, and
boil undisturbed until sugar caramelizes to a deep amber color,
about 7 minutes. Immediately pour caramel over nuts. Let cool, then
break into 1-inch pieces. Place in a food processor, and grind to a
powder. In a bowl, combine praline powder with almond flour, and
set aside.
</P>
<P>
   2. In bowl of a mixer fitted with paddle attachment, cream
butter and remaining sugar until mixture is light and fluffy, about
2 minutes. Scrape down sides of bowl. Add eggs one at a time,
beating well between additions. Add vanilla, and beat mixture for
another minute.
</P>
<P>
   3. Meanwhile, in another bowl, whisk together the flour,
cinnamon, baking powder and salt. Add to the butter mixture, and
mix until just combined. Stir in the praline mixture until fully
combined. Form dough into a disk, wrap in plastic and refrigerate
for 3 hours or until firm.
</P>
<P>
   4. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease several baking sheets, or
line with parchment paper. Unwrap dough, and put between two pieces
of plastic wrap. Roll out to ] inch thick. Cut out cookies using a
2{-inch cookie cutter, and place on prepared baking sheets 1 inch
apart. Reroll all scraps to cut out more cookies. If dough gets too
soft, put it into freezer for a few minutes until firm. Bake
cookies for 12 to 14 minutes, until pale golden brown.

 &HT;    Oh, baby, this doesn't belong on TV
 &HT;    By Andrea Sarvady
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Now that Rick Rockwell and Darva Conger of ``Who Wants
to Marry a Multi-Millionaire'' have morphed into television trivia,
it's time to look toward the future: What other personal rites of
passage can we expect to see on the small screen? Someone's first
sexual experience? No, that's every Fox show. Someone giving birth
on television? No, I know for a fact that was done by ``Good
Morning America'' a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   I should know. I was asked to be that someone.
</P>
<P>
   The year: 1992. The place: New York City. My first pregnancy was
proceeding like that of many New York women, sick in the subway,
knocked over in Times Square, ignored by taxi drivers, mistaken for
a taxi myself.
</P>
<P>
   So I was thrilled when our Lamaze coach at New York Hospital
left a message on the machine with a ``special proposal.'' Free
diapers? Better yet, a free epidural? (One look at those movies and
I had lost all interest in giving birth without drugs.)
</P>
<P>
   It turned out our coach had something far more dramatic in mind.
</P>
<P>
   She'd received a phone call from the idea people at ABC. They
were looking for an expectant father to profile for ``Good Morning
America.'' The story would follow the new dad from labor and
delivery to the family home weeks later, recording the joys and
challenges of becoming a father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought of you folks immediately,'' the coach assured me.
</P>
<P>
   This didn't sound like a compliment. You want to be thought of
immediately when people see a gorgeous movie star, or are in a
present-buying mood. But giving birth on national television?
Screaming and flailing about like an insane person for 15 minutes
of fame?
</P>
<P>
   ``What about the screaming and flailing?'' I asked my coach, who
had suddenly become my agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, the cameras will be discreet,'' she assured me. Discreet?
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that my husband would also hate the idea, but hoping to
stretch the anecdote potential of the offer, I called the ABC
people for more information. Yes indeed, they planned to film the
birth, but the focus would be on my endearingly anxious husband. I
wouldn't be seen on-camera at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' I said to the ABC people. ``That takes care of the
flailing. But what about the screaming?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean, you?'' the young PR flak responded. I think she sort
of forgot I had to be there too. ``Well, hmm. It will be hard to
edit out the sound effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Sound effects.
</P>
<P>
   I passed. ``But thank you,'' I added cheerfully, feeling
sufficiently covered in the anecdote department. That night, I
shared the details with friends all over the country. Would you
have done it? I asked, over and over. Would you give birth,
off-camera, on national television? Would you?
</P>
<P>
   The vote was almost unanimous. Two women said yes, dozens more
gave a firm no. Not for a first birth. Not for any birth. Not for
money. Not for a good story. Not for anything.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, ``Good Morning America'' found a young doctor and
his wife willing to share this rare, once-in-a-lifetime experience
with millions of Americans. I bet he worked for the hospital. I bet
she worked for ABC.
</P>
<P>
   As for my first birth, it was a glorious and breathtaking
12-hour miniseries that at least two viewers found utterly
riveting.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of those ``sound effects'' is now 7 years old, and the
world seems to have changed a lot since then. People do everything
on TV now, with anyone; perhaps the most surprising thing about the
``Rick and Darva Show'' was its capacity to still shock an
increasingly jaded audience.
</P>
<P>
   No one's asking, but I'm still pretty firm in my resolve to keep
the major life events off screen. Heck, I don't even like home
videos.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: McCain's new GOP
 &HT;    (EDs: This is an editorial from Wednesday's Atlanta
Constitution.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Republican leaders are trying to boot John McCain out
of their party, stripping him of his conservative credentials and
shipping him back to Arizona with a dishonorable discharge.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain being McCain, he's not going home without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   In a remarkable speech Monday in Virginia, the former fighter
pilot brought candid clarity to what's at stake in his battle for
the Republican presidential nomination. As McCain pointed out, he
has a long record as one of the most conservative members of
Congress. He opposes gun control and abortion, supports school
vouchers, advocates more spending on defense and distrusts
environmentalists and their cause. The charge that he is somehow a
liberal Democrat in disguise is hard to sustain.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, McCain is being called a traitor to his party because
of his stance on three issues:
</P>
<P>
   _ He does not kowtow to the Christian Coalition and others who
would impose a mean-spirited form of Christianity on the rest of
us.
</P>
<P>
   _ He opposes large tax cuts for the rich, believing that the
federal surplus would be better spent reducing our massive national
debt and bolstering Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   _ He advocates reform of the campaign-finance system, believing
that government influence should not be peddled to the highest
bidder.
</P>
<P>
   In the minds of GOP leaders, those three issues apparently
define what it means to be a Republican. Those who disagree aren't
welcome in their party.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, on the other hand, believes there must be a place in the
Republican Party for people who believe as he does. In fact, he
argues that such people are the party's future. And he's not alone.
In states that allow it, he has been joined by hundreds of
thousands of independents and Democrats who have crossed party
lines to vote in his favor. The GOP establishment tries to dismiss
those voters as meddlers out to cause trouble, but that's crazy.
People treat their vote with more respect than that.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, moderate voters are backing McCain out of a
heartfelt hope that he will transform the Republican Party into
something they can respect and even support again. In large part,
they are mainstream Americans who were left stranded by the GOP's
rightward lurch of the '80s. Those voters stayed in the Republican
camp as long as it was headed by Ronald Reagan, whose genial
personality softened the harsh edges of that new ideology. But once
Reagan left the scene, they left with him.
</P>
<P>
   That's not mere theory. In the 1992 presidential election,
George Bush got 38 percent of the vote. In 1996, Bob Dole got 41
percent. The voters who in the '80s had given the Republicans
landslide victories had disappeared by the '90s. To paraphrase
Reagan, they didn't leave the Republican Party. The Republican
Party had left them.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those stranded voters ended up in the Reform Party,
which appealed to their conservative distrust of government without
requiring them to pay homage to religious ayatollahs or fatcat
special interests. And a lot of them ended up in the Democratic
camp, seduced by Bill Clinton's apparent moderation on social
issues. Clinton's success drove many Republicans to distraction,
wondering how the American people could twice put such an obviously
flawed man in the White House. They blamed Clinton for being the
devil, they blamed the voters for being so easily fooled. They did
everything but ask themselves the question that mattered:
</P>
<P>
   If in two consecutive elections, voters found Bill Clinton more
trustworthy than the Republicans, what did that say about the
Republicans?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, McCain is asking that question, but the GOP
establishment refuses to hear it. The truth is, they would rather
lose with George W. Bush than win with John McCain, and there's a
practical reason for that attitude. It's not motivated by ideology
or faith or what's best for the country. It's about power and
money.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush should run in November and lose, the lives of GOP
bigwigs don't change. McCain described them Monday as ``people who
have turned good causes into businesses,'' and that's about right.
They'll stay in Washington, still happily skimming off a nice
percentage of the soft money flowing into that town, still milking
their direct-mailing list for contributions, still throwing their
weight around as the self-appointed champions of whatever interest
group _ the anti-tax lobby, the Christian right, the gun
enthusiasts _ they happen to represent.
</P>
<P>
   But should McCain win the nomination, the jig is up. Ralph Reed
and Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell fall out of power, their grip
on the Republican Party broken. The money-changers _ the lobbyists
who change money into legislation _ will be tossed from the
nation's secular temple. A new Republican Party would be formed,
still conservative on social issues, still distrustful of
government, but willing to compete for votes on the basis of ideas,
not campaign cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe it's loyal to suggest that the Republican
Party cannot stand on its own feet and fight for public opinion
without six and seven-figure contributions from people with
interests before government ... ,'' McCain said Monday. ``I don't
believe it's loyal to suggest that the Republican establishment is
more important to save than a Republican majority.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a powerful message, in part because McCain knows
something about loyalty and about the high price you sometimes have
to pay for it. He has his faults, like the rest of us, but betrayal
just isn't in him.

IS NOMAR OVERDOING IT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Nomar Garciaparra's going to miss at least a
week of spring training because of a sprain in the lateral
collateral ligament in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   The star shortsop underwent an MRI early Tuesday, and Red Sox
physician Bill Morgan recommended a week of rest.
</P>
<P>
   This means Garciaparra won't be in the lineup when the Sox open
their spring schedule against the Twins Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There goes the pennant,'' was the deadpan summation offered by
veteran Mike Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Missing some Grapefruit games is no big deal, and the Sox might
be babying their franchise infielder in this instance. But the
larger question seems to be _ is Nomar training too hard and is he
going to be injury-prone throughout his career?
</P>
<P>
   Life's unfair. Garciaparra works harder than any player on the
Red Sox. His offseason Navy Seal-conditioning routine is the stuff
of legend, and each year he comes to camp bigger and stronger. He
showed up in Fort Myers last week looking as if he'd swallowed a
couple of barbells. His body fat was measured at 5 percent, down
from last year's Belushi-like 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Is there such a thing as over-training (a common problem for
generations of Shaughhnessys)?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that I know of,'' answered Nomar. ``I don't know. I'm sure
you can. Everyone's going to make excuses _ you do this and you do
that. But they're not complaining when you're successful, I'll tell
you that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I back off? No, I don't back off. I do everything I'm
supposed to do, all the things I've done to this point. I focus on
other areas every year, what I feel I need to do looking back at
last year and I just need to focus on . . . I never try to get
bigger. I never try to get big, period. I haven't. I'm not much
bigger than I was last year. So there's nothing changed. I came in
actually more flexible better than I have any years.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to say everything they want, but I separated
my shoulder in college, too. You pull a muscle in college, you
sprain an ankle, and they said I was big then. They say it now just
because . . . they're not complaining when the guy hits 30 home
runs and doing all this other stuff. It makes me laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring Garciaparra strained his throwing elbow and missed
11 days. He flew to the West Coast to get a second opinion. He
missed six games with a strained hamstring in April, then another
11 games with a strained left groin before the All- Star break. In
September, he was hit on a wrist by a fastball and missed the last
eight games of the regular season and one playoff game. In 1998 he
was on the disabled list with a sprained joint in his right
shoulder. He missed only nine games in his rookie season, but in
his final year in the minors he suffered a sprained ankle and a
hamstring tendon tear behind his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Injury-prone?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just weird things like this one,'' he said. ``Last year,
you get in the cold, you pull a hammie. When you hurt something,
everything's connected. During the season you try to come back and
play and you put stress on other areas. Then a freak thing like
getting hit in the wrist. And it's like, `Well, you have all these
injuries,' well, I didn't hit myself in the wrist. Things just
happen, so you play through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra sustained this latest injury while fielding
grounders last Friday. He hurt the knee when he planted his right
leg to throw to first. Tuesday he stretched with teammates, played
catch, stood in the infield during batting practice, and hit in the
cage. But he won't run or do anything strenuous for a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a week, it could be longer, it may be less,'' he
said. ``We're just going day by day now. I'm just going out there
doing what I'm capable of doing. I'm not going to aggravate it any
more, especially now. There's no need to aggravate it anymore. If
you're going to take time, now's the time to do it. I don't really
think it's going to set me back any at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will linger. If we take care of it now, it
won't linger so that's what it's all about. If this were during the
season, you'd probably see me trying to get out there. I've felt
improvement every single day and that's a good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things that just happens. You can walk and
step off the curb and have something happen. You can't simulate
those sorts of things. You can say, why did it happen. But it did.
You plant wrong, you slip a little bit, anything's going to go.
Things like that just happen. (Jeff) Frye went down last year on a
freakish thing. You know what I mean? Weird things happen. There's
no explanation especially when you're dealing with things like
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about falling behind. If I didn't train as hard
as I do in the offseason then you could say I might need a full
spring training to get in shape. But I came in ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The glut of great young shortstops in the American League has
spawned more than a few barroom arguments. In baseball history,
there have never been three shortstops _ playing simultaneously _
who are on a par with Garciaparra, Yankee Derek Jeter, and Mariner
Alex Rodriguez. But Nomar's going to fall behind his All-Star
brethren if he spends too much of his career on the shelf.
</P>
<P>
   Relax, Nomie. Take a few days off. Eat a cupcake. Stay loose.

<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ This struggling country has been short of a
lot of things lately. Fuel to fill up its cars. Foreign currency to
pay for its imports. And now, space to bury its dead.
</P>
<P>
   Not even five years after it opened, the country's biggest
cemetery, on the outskirts of the biggest city, Harare, is filling
up faster than planners ever expected. That is largely because of
one of the few things the country unfortunately has no shortage of:
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago, we were burying six or seven bodies a day,''
said Wilson Chiperesa, who oversees the grave digging and
groundskeeping for most of Granville Cemetery, as the sprawling
graveyard is known. ``Now we're doing 15, 16, 17 a day.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems faced by officials here in this corner of Harare
show how the devastating AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa has
had an impact on virtually every aspect of community life.
</P>
<P>
   The cemetery, spread over about 250 acres of former farmland,
will not be turning away corpses this year and probably not even
this decade, but it will be a lot sooner than planned, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the cemetery's office, adorned with calling cards and
calendars from funeral homes but little else, every burial is
recorded in longhand, with the name, date, cause of death and other
particulars neatly noted. So far nearly 8,000 people have been
buried here, said Chiperesa, who has worked in city burial grounds
for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they built this, they said it would take 30 or 40 years
to fill it up,'' he said. ``Now, it will take 15, maybe 20,
years.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is assuming that the rate of AIDS deaths does not
climb. Already, the disease is taking as many as 2,500 lives a
week, and a quarter of the country's 6 million adults are believed
to be infected with the virus that causes AIDS, according to the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   A look at a page in the cemetery's ledger from the week of Feb.
11 to Feb. 17 hints at the pattern. A sample of the ages: 32, 28,
70, 10, 17, 24, 29, 25, 37, 61 and 35. The listed causes only make
it clearer: immunosuppression appears only once, but pneumonia and
tuberculosis, illnesses that prey on immune systems weakened by
AIDS, appear frequently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worries me,'' said Chiperesa, 47, who and is otherwise
matter-of-fact about his work. ``I see a lot of breadwinners
passing away.''
</P>
<P>
   No country in Africa has been harder hit by AIDS over the last
two decades. Mounting economic problems here have only compounded
the crisis, driving more and more Zimbabweans into poverty and
straining the state's resources to help them. The looming shortage
of burial space is but one small symptom of the pain, present and
future.
</P>
<P>
   City officials were so worried by the surge in burials at
Granville that they raised the idea of encouraging cremation as an
alternative to a traditional burial, said Eladinos Zimbwa, the city
official in charge of cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposal was quickly abandoned, and from his dealing
with many grieving Zimbabwean families, Chiperesa said, it was
clear why. ``They don't want to hear about it,'' he said. ``They
have a culture of beliefs in God and tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   So with little relief in sight, all that Chiperesa and his
gravediggers can do is dig. When the cemetery opened, the workers
numbered about 15. Today there are about 3 dozen, and no shortage
of work. Each day, they dig at least a dozen plots for the
following day's burials.
</P>
<P>
   On a day in January there were 27 burials, the most the cemetery
can accommodate in a single day. Making sure every family is
properly attended to and has its space is no easy feat on such
days. ``Sometimes, it's very hard,'' Chiperesa said.
</P>
<P>
   Along the road to the cemetery, roadside stands sell memorial
decorations. They hang from wire strung up between trees _ hearts
and crosses fashioned out of plastic foam or plastic sheeting,
painted blue for men and pink or yellow for women, and often
inscribed with words Rest in Peace.
</P>
<P>
   Lameck Mhlanga, 32, has been selling decorations along the road
for three years, and he has noticed the change. ``We are selling
more than before,'' he explained late one afternoon as he and his
family prepared to pack up their goods for the night. ``It used to
be a few a day. Now it's five or six, especially on weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at the cemetery, items sold by Mhlanga and his growing
number of competitors dot many of the fresher graves. It is not a
fancy burial ground. In many places, the grass grows a couple of
feet high.
</P>
<P>
   One area of the cemetery is better maintained, but burial there
costs more and this is a poor country. So for most people who die
in and around Harare, the rougher area will be their final resting
place. Burial here costs the equivalent of about $14 for an adult,
$8 for an infant.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the graves have tombstones. Most have only textbook-size
metal plates, with the deceased's name and dates of birth and death
painted by hand. They stand just a foot or a foot and a half above
the ground, and are soon covered by the fast-growing grass that was
planted years ago for hungry cattle.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping pace with the grass is hard, and keeping pace with the
burials is growing harder, said Zimbwa, the city official in charge
of cemeteries, adding, ``We'll have to keep looking for space.''

HUNGER STRIKE WEAKENS ALLEGED CUBAN SPY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The health of the alleged spy who refuses to come in
from Canada's cold was said to be ``deteriorating'' Tuesday as the
result of a hunger strike staged to protest his expulsion from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Flouting Canada's demand that he leave the country, Jose
Imperatori _ a diplomat assigned to Cuba's office in Washington
until he was deported last week amid allegations of espionage _
remained holed up in the Cuban Embassy in Ottawa in a peaceable but
strange stand-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is starving because of a situation created by the United
States,'' said Camilio Garcia, second secretary at the embassy.
``This is not a problem with Canada, it's a problem between Cuba
and the US.''
</P>
<P>
   But the situation has become an irritation and embarrassment for
Canada, which allowed the United States to fly Imperatori to
Montreal Saturday with the understanding he would immediately board
a commercial flight to Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the 46-year-old envoy bolted for Ottawa, vowing to
remain within the walls of Cuba's embassy in the Canadian capital
until the United States apologizes and permits him to resume his
duties in Washington. ``This is a struggle against slanders that
hurt my honor,'' he declared through a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Canada unhappily stuck in the crossfire of the
latest row between Washington and Havana.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian government ordered Imperatori Tuesday to leave the
country immediately, but Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy conceded
there is little that can be done to evict the alleged spy since the
embassy is Cuban territory under international law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a serious breach,'' Axworthy told reporters. ``I trust
(Cuba) recognizes they have a responsibility in this matter. . . .
We pointed out to them this is not the way to conduct affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, what started as a fairly minor diplomatic fray has
grabbed front-page attention across Canada, sparked protest
demonstrations in Havana, and bemused Cuba watchers, who can't
understand why Fidel Castro's regime is willing to risk harming
relations with Canada, a crucial diplomatic ally and the island's
most important source of investment, tourists, and foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's weird about this case is the guy's righteous
indignation,'' said David Welch, a Cuban affairs specialist at the
University of Toronto. ``He's personally offended. . . . What an
overreaction. Why not just go home?''
</P>
<P>
   Imperatori got the boot from the United States after being
accused of maintaining ``illicit contacts,'' in the State
Department's phrase, with a senior official of the Immmigration and
Naturalization Service who has been charged with passing secrets to
the communist island state.
</P>
<P>
   The spy ruckus comes as the United States and Cuba are at
loggerheads over the fate of a 6-year-old Cuban boy, Elian
Gonzalez, who was rescued from the sea last November by the US
Coast Guard after his mother drowned trying to flee Cuba. Elian is
living with relatives in Florida, but the Castro government wants
him returned to his father in Cuba.

PONDERING A CAREER TRANSITION FOR STRAWBERRY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., N.J., Fla., Canada)   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ They shared a life with Darryl Strawberry, riding
buses, planes and trains. They have spent many months on baseball
fields all over the country with him. They have prayed with him.
But even after all that time, his teammates do not know what he
might do outside of baseball now that his career is in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry was suspended for a year on Monday by Bud Selig, the
commissioner of baseball, in response to a failed drug test Jan.
19. It was Strawberry's third violation of his drug aftercare
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to get his life back on track,'' David Cone, a
longtime teammate of Strawberry, said. ``He's got to get his
addiction under control. Beyond that, he's got a lot of life to
live.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry has discussed the possibility of going into a
substance abuse treatment center, an American League official said.
This is something Strawberry has done twice in the past, in 1990
(Smithers Center in New York) and 1994 (Betty Ford Clinic in
California).
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry cannot play baseball in the major leagues, or even
those minor league teams that are a part of the national
association. He eventually could play in an independent league
again, as he did in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from teams in Newark and Montclair, N.J.; from Long
Island and from St. Paul, Minn., say they would welcome Strawberry.
But he would make far less than the $750,000 he would have made
this year playing for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   But Cone and others expressed hope that Strawberry will
concentrate on something other than baseball, for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things to look forward to, regardless of
whether he plays baseball again,'' Cone said. ``I think he needs to
be told that right now. If the baseball career is over, that can be
depressing in and of itself for a lot of players, much less someone
with an addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter said: ``What he should do is get help. I'm sure
baseball has something set up where he can get some help. He's
going to be faced with a lot of time where he's used to playing and
used to coming to the field every day, and it's a situation where
he doesn't have that. We're all going to be supportive of him. But
he's got to find something on his own to do as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry could play professional baseball, but for teams in
leagues that have no affiliation with Major League Baseball, no
big-time television exposure, no big money.
</P>
<P>
   The Newark Bears play in the Atlantic League, and can pay a
maximum of $3,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not going to get rich in our league,'' Rick Cerone, a
former Yankees catcher who owns the Bears, said. ``But he is going
to get a chance to play and stay sharp. We are a viable option for
Darryl.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees do have a roundabout affiliation with the Montclair
Jackals, who play next to the Yogi Berra Museum, which is filled
with artifacts donated by George Steinbrenner, the Yankees'
principal owner. The possibility of having Strawberry in Montclair
is being discussed, Greg Lockhard, president of the Jackals, said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure if we'll pursue it,'' Lockhard said. ``I guess
it's already become apparent it's a possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, however, no one in the Yankees' organization had any
tangible insight into what Strawberry will do next. Several
teammates tried calling but couldn't reach Strawberry, and
Steinbrenner said that when he tried calling Strawberry's home, but
the phone was blocked from receiving more calls.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez suggested that perhaps Strawberry would continue
to make speaking appearances, contribute to charity work. Cone
vagely mentioned business opportunities. There might be a time
when Strawberry could coach. He could use ``help with career
transition,'' said Cone. ``Try to help him with an educational
program to get him into a career transition, if that's the
direction he decides to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that his baseball career is over. But assuming
that it is, he's going to need a lot of support right now. I think
it goes a lot deeper than just the team _ I think management and
the union could do a lot better job in this regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Martinez: ``We need to keep talking to him, let him know
we're thinking about him. We've just got to keep calling, can't
abandon him and forget about him. We've just got to keep bothering
him as much as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   They spoke with concern for Strawberry, in worried voices. But
no one criticized Selig's decision. ``I didn't envy the
commissioner in this particular case,'' said Cone. ``Last year, it
was supposed to be a year, and it was reduced to 120 days. It's
pretty hard to make a strong argument that this penalty was too
harsh.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   Ed Yarnall, expected to replace Hideki Irabu as the Yankees' No.
5 starter, is hampered by a sore lower back and probably won't
resume throwing for a few days. Club officials don't think
Yarnall's ailment is serious. ``Camp Cramps, I'm calling it,'' said
general manager Brian Cashman, referring to the minor physical
problems of Yarnall, Orlando Hernandez and others ... Andy
Pettitte's father, Tom Pettitte, is visiting the camp. The elder
Pettitte said he worked with his son in the off-season on his
change-up, a pitch that Andy Pettitte intends to re-establish this
season... Jake Westbrook, the pitcher acquired for Irabu, will
start the Yankees' first exhibition game Thursday, against the
Toronto Blue Jays.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAKAR, Senegal _ In a human rights case that was inspired by the
one against Augusto Pinochet, the former president of Chad is
expected to stand trial later this year for his government's crimes
against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The case against the former president, Hissene Habre, is being
watched closely in Africa, where brutal rulers have engaged in
widespread human rights violations with impunity. The accusations
against Habre are already resonating across a continent where laws
are applied inconsistently to the powerful and powerless.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a message to other African leaders that nothing will
be the same any longer,'' said Delphine Djiraibe, president of a
human rights group working on the case. ``It shows that Africa can
also play a role in the fight for human rights and can fight on its
own soil.''
</P>
<P>
   The case against Habre, 57, who has lived in exile in Dakar
since being toppled from power in 1990, has also stirred some
impassioned comments among African intellectuals. Some of them
defend Habre by arguing that guilt cannot be assigned to African
leaders of his generation because they were merely creations and
pawns of Cold War superpowers.
</P>
<P>
   But several human rights organizations have worked quietly for
months to collect evidence against Habre, on the legal basis that a
person can be tried for crimes against humanity in any country and
that former heads of state are not immune. The human rights groups
say they have documented 97 cases of political killings, 142 cases
of torture and 100 cases of people who have disappeared in Chad, an
impoverished, land-locked desert nation in central Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was considered an extraordinary sight when the former
president appeared in a Sengalese court Feb. 3. He has been in
Dakar under house arrest since being indicted on torture charges by
a Sengalese court.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps even more startling had been the testimony, a few
days earlier in the same court, of a half-dozen ordinary Chadians
who told of being arrested and tortured during the Habre regime.
</P>
<P>
   One of the prisoners, Souleyman Guengueng, was a civil servant
who was arrested in August 1988 by the Chadian government's
notorious security and documentation squad and accused of being an
opponent of the government. Guengueng, who was still recovering
from an operation he had undergone just days before the arrest,
said he then spent the next two years being tortured.
</P>
<P>
   According to Guengueng, he lost consciousness for so long on
three occasions that his fellow prisoners left him for dead. Up to
10 men were kept in one cell built for a single prisoner, so that
their legs eventually became paralyzed. And he said that three to
four people died every day from malaria, flea infestation, lack of
food, suffocation or sheer heat.
</P>
<P>
   He also recalled how 300 of their fellow prisoners had been
jammed into one small cell; the guards would pour water into the
cell from the ceiling, forcing the men to lick the floor or their
bodies so as not to die of thirst.
</P>
<P>
   Guengueng, reached by telephone in N'djamena, the capital of
Chad, said he still has trouble walking and suffers from poor
vision because of a powerful light that, at one point during his
incarceration, was directed continuously at him from a close
distance. ``My joy was great in that courtroom. Hissene Habre never
thought that one day he would be brought to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chad, the ``untouchable'' are the elite who gravitate around
the president and are above the law, said Djiraibe, president of
the Chadian Association for the Promotion and Defense of Human
Rights. Those who engage in the ``politics of the belly'' are
political opponents who make enough noise to earn some money and
find some protection under the law, while the rest of society
cannot count on the law to protect them, Djiraibe said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the terms may change, inequality before the law is a
given elsewhere in Africa. In the Ivory Coast, the three classes
described by Djiraibe are sometimes described as officials of
steel, wood, and cotton. That is why the case against Habre _ who
as a former head of state was the ultimate untouchable or official
of steel _ carries a greater significance in Africa, human rights
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Senegal is regarded as having one of the few independent
judiciaries in Africa, and that is one of the main reasons that
international human rights organizations, including Human Rights
Watch and the International Federation of Human Rights, have joined
in the case against Habre.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is now showing that there are African countries in which
you can put these principles of human rights in practice,'' said
Reed Brody, advocacy director of the New York-based Human Rights
Watch. ``The case has profound implications in a way that it would
not if it were being held in a European country, particularly a
colonial country. That's one of the things that Latin Americans
were saying about the Pinochet case _ that it was Europe imposing
its laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Brody pointed out that while several other African dictators are
in exile _ for instance, Uganda's Idi Amin in Saudi Arabia or
Ethiopia's Mengistu Haile Mariam in Zimbabwe _ the courts in those
countries are not free enough to pursue a similar case against
those former leaders.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Chad _ a creation of French colonial mapmakers who threw
together different populations into a desolate patch of land twice
the size of Texas _ has experienced continual war since gaining
independence in 1960. In 1982, Habre, a rebel chieftain, seized
power and ingratiated himself with France and the United States for
being one Africa's staunchest opponents of Lybia's Col. Moammar
Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
   During Habre's eight-year rule, his U.S. and French backers
often portrayed him positively, describing him as a charismatic
leader and intellectual who genuinely cared about issues facing the
developing world.
</P>
<P>
   But the French eventually tired of Habre, who was increasingly
being criticized by human rights monitors, just as French President
Francois Mitterand talked of openness and democracy in a post-Cold
War Africa. And in December 1990, after a French-supported invasion
from Sudan, Idriss Deby _ who had served as Habre's military
commander and had been the country's No. 2 _ overthrew Habre and
sent him into exile.
</P>
<P>
   In Dakar, several Senegalese intellectuals said that it was
hypocritical of Western human rights organizations to pursue Habre
now, given their governments' previous support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hissene Habre was received and honored in Paris as a head of
state and ally,'' said Babacar Sine, one of Senegal's most famous
intellectuals. ``France never regarded him as a dictator.''
</P>
<P>
   Sine, who has known Habre for 40 years, added: ``This case is
much more complex than the role of Habre. There is the role of
France that supported him. There is the role of the United States
that supported him. If we are to judge Hissene Habre, we have to
also judge those who supported him.''
</P>
<P>
   Another complicating factor is that Deby is still president of
Chad, where human rights monitors say arbitrary killings by the
government's security forces, torture, beatings, and other forms of
abuse remain common. Human rights organizations behind the case are
pushing for the trial to take place in Senegal; if Habre were
extradited to Chad, they say, it is unlikely that there would be a
fair trial because his testimony would inevitably implicate members
of the current government, including Deby.
</P>
<P>
   Madicke Niang, a Senegalese lawyer defending Habre, said that
his client acknowledged that human rights abuses had occurred under
his rule, but denied its scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``He denies the acts he is accused of,'' Niang said. ``And if
these acts did occur, he denies having had any knowledge of them.
It is Idriss Deby who should be held responsible for those acts
because he was Hissene Habre's military commander.''
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to determine the exact scale of the abuse under
Habre because the only extensive report was made by a truth
commission set up by Idriss. The commission said that the Habre
government carried out 40,000 political killings and 200,000 cases
of torture, and that Habre gave direct orders to target certain
groups or persons. Habre is said to have fled Chad with more than
$11 million.

&HT;     COURT EXAMINES POLICE SEARCHES; WEIGHS USE OF ANONYMOUS TIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c. 2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Supreme Court justices asked tough questions
Tuesday when they heard arguments on when police may stop and frisk
people who do not appear to have broken the law.
</P>
<P>
   In a case from Miami, police received an anonymous tip in 1995
that three young black men were at a bus stop and that one, who was
wearing a plaid shirt, was toting a gun. When officers arrived,
they saw nothing suspicious but patted down the young man with the
plaid shirt and found a gun. A Florida Supreme Court ruled in 1998
that the search, based only on the anonymous tip, was
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   In another case from Sierra Blanca, Texas, a federal border
patrol agent was checking passengers' immigration status on a
Greyhound bus at a border checkpoint there in 1997. The agent
started feeling suitcases in the overhead rack and came upon a
brick-like object that turned out to be a pack of the drug
methamphetamine. A federal appeals court upheld the search last
year, saying the passenger should not have expected that his
luggage in the rack would stay completely private.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the high court justices will have to decide
whether officers may conduct a search when they lack any specific
reason to believe a crime has occurred.
</P>
<P>
   How the court rules could have a major impact on the safety of
officers who often are caught off-guard by concealed firearms as
they try to combat drug trafficking and violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision could also affect the rights of people,
particularly those living in heavily patrolled high-crime areas,
who say that aggressive tactics encroach on their privacy and
deprive innocent citizens of their freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Representing the young man, known only as ``J.L.,'' in the Miami
case, attorney Harvey Sepler told the court that allowing police to
search any person _ regardless of his or her behavior _ because an
anonymous tipster says that person has a gun would mean ``the end''
of the Fourth Amendment. That amendment protects citizens from
``unreasonable searches.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have a situation where anyone, anywhere, anytime can be
stopped and searched not because they are doing anything illegal
but because someone _ anyone _ says they should be searched,''
Sepler said.
</P>
<P>
   But several justices questioned whether ignoring an anonymous
tip concerning a weapon could endanger the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if the police get a tip that a student has brought a gun
into a school and plans to use it that day?'' Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor asked. ``Should the police just ignore this information
and possibly let students and teachers be killed?''
</P>
<P>
   Although she had no knowledge of the event, O'Connor's question
came about the same time that a six-year-old girl was being shot to
death by a seven-year-old classmate at an elementary school in
Mount Morris Township, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen Breyer asked if police should ignore a tip that
a man standing outside a crowded courthouse had a bomb under his
shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Sepler said the court could make exceptions for ``extreme
situations'' but that it should write its decision with ``everyday
situations'' in mind, and that meant not allowing police to search
a person with only an anonymous tip for a reason.
</P>
<P>
   The justices were just as tough on Florida Assistant Attorney
General Michael Neimand who urged them to take a ``common-sense
approach'' to the issue. They should give law enforcement officials
on the scene the flexibility to assess, on a case-by-case basis,
the potential for the immediate and lethal use of a weapon by a
suspect, Neimand argued.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Antonin Scalia asked what would stop police from
abusing the anonymous-tip rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime a cop suspects someone of carrying drugs or a gun but
doesn't have any evidence, all that he has to do is go to a pay
phone, call the police station and within a few minutes, his fellow
officers will be searching that person, despite having no real
reason other than the `anonymous' tip,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The justices took a similarly hard look in the Texas bus-search
case.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Carolyn Fuentes of San Antonio contended that the
drug-smuggling conviction of her client, Steven Bond, should be
overturned because the agent in his case had no reasonable
suspicion, probable cause, or consent to squeeze his bag.But Scalia
said that because Bond put his bag in a public place _ the overhead
rack _ he had ``no reasonable expectation'' that the police or any
of the bus' other passengers wouldn't touch his bag.
</P>
<P>
   Disagreeing, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the border patrol
agent may have gone too far. He went beyond the normal ``pushing
and shoving of bags'' that occurs on a bus or plane, she said.
``Mr. Bond did have a reasonable expectation that other passengers
would sit there and not manipulate his bag,'' she said.

 &HT;    Elbow's a pain to Chipper Jones
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kissimmee, Fla. _ Chipper Jones had plenty to challenge him this
spring, namely trying to follow an MVP season. Now he has something
else to worry about _ a bone spur in his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves hope the injury, caused by strain from the repetition
of throwing, won't cost Jones playing time this season and that he
can have it operated on after the season.
</P>
<P>
   Pieces of the spur have broken off and are floating in his
elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty common,'' Braves team orthopedist Joe Chandler
said. ``He's had it for a while. It's just now bothering him. It's
something we hope we can take care of at the end of the season.''
``There's nothing you can do for it, just take stuff to keep the
swelling down,'' Jones said. ``I'm not real big on injections.
That's only going to shoot it full of cortisone. But, really, it
hasn't bothered me that much. It just bothers me when I get in
front swinging left-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the elbow doesn't hurt that much until at night, away
from the ballpark. He is taking anti-inflammatories and is counting
on playing at his usual high level.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jones might need more rest, even if he doesn't want it,
and that's where Bobby Bonilla could help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like taking days off,'' said Jones, who played in a
career-high 160 games last season ``I wouldn't mind a couple of
innings here and there. Like in the sixth inning, when we have a
seven, eight-run lead, let those guys get some at-bats.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones has been healthy since what was supposed to have been his
rookie year in 1994. He tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his
left knee in a spring training game and missed that season.
</P>
<P>
   Jones continued the same rigorous offseason workouts that helped
him get off to a hot start in last year's spring training. However,
the workouts were interrupted by a few more trips to awards
ceremonies. Jones said he reported to camp at his heaviest weight
ever, 225 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   He aggravated the elbow injury while lifting weights, doing a
triceps press, three weeks before the start of spring training. He
took three weeks off but has started lifting again.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Jones' mind this spring is his contract, as he seeks to
become baseball's highest-paid player. He wants to have it worked
out by the time the Braves break camp; otherwise, he said he'll
wait until after the season, when he becomes a free agent, to try
to work out a deal.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, Jones has stayed busy getting ready to defend his
MVP title. His goals, however, remain the same, he said: hitting
.300, driving in 100 runs and scoring 100.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he would not try to hit 45 home runs again. ``I
don't expect to hit that many,'' Jones said. ``That's a lot of home
runs. But I know if I have a good year, I'm capable of hitting 50.
I feel like I'm getting better and improving every year. I just may
not go through a stretch like I went through last year when
everything I hit for a week or two went out.''
</P>
<P>
   His work habits and attitude have impressed his new hitting
coach, Merv Rettenmund.
</P>
<P>
   ``You watch guys like that, you know he's good,'' Rettenmund
said. ``Whether he hits the ball good or not, you know the swing is
there.''

 &HT;    Freshman Forte leads Tar Heels
 &HT;    By Pat Donahue
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chapel Hill, N.C. _ Michael Jordan didn't do it. Vince Carter
didn't do it. Neither did Antawn Jamison. Or Jerry Stackhouse.
</P>
<P>
   None of those future NBA stars did what Joe Forte is about to do
_ lead the North Carolina Tar Heels in scoring as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Going into tonight's game with Georgia Tech, Forte is averaging
16.2 points per game, seventh in the ACC, just 0.1 behind Tech's
Jason Collier in sixth. Forte, who scored 26 points Saturday at
Maryland, also is third on his team in rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Forte has done it so quietly that it escaped the attention of
coach Bill Guthridge. ``I didn't even know he was our leading
scorer,'' Guthridge said.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina's freshman class was supposed to be one if its best.
But Jason Parker never made it into school, which left Forte as the
lone blue-chipper to go to Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Forte, who went to middle school in Smyrna and was recruited
heavily by Georgia Tech, has scored in double figures in all but
three games. He has been named the ACC rookie of the week three
times and in a surprisingly strong ACC freshman class _ including
Jason Williams, Carlos Boozer, Damien Wilkins and Travis Watson _
Forte tops all frosh scorers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Forte doesn't regard himself as the first option in the
offense, especially when such established players as Ed Cota,
Brendan Haywood and Jason Capel are on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a freshman, you don't want to go out and shoot the
ball all the time,'' he said. ``The seniors have put in their
time.''
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't taken the 6-foot-4 Forte long to get used to
playing at Carolina. His 24 points in the 82-65 season-opener
against Southern California set a UNC record for points in a debut
by any player. It helped him earn the MVP honors for the Maui
Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, for someone who averaged 22 points a game as a
senior at high school powerhouse DeMatha Catholic, Forte was
expected to have an impact. At least by the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joseph came from a good high school program,'' Guthridge said.
``He's an ingredient we thought we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's clearly established himself as one of the best young
players in college basketball,'' N.C. State head coach Herb Sendek
said.
</P>
<P>
   Offense is Forte's forte and his best output was 27 against
Virginia. But scoring isn't his only strength. He also leads
Carolina in steals.

COMMENTARY: DOA AT THE IMF 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By PAUL KRUGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing in the bylaws of the International Monetary Fund says
that its managing director has to be European. Still, there is a
long tradition to that effect _ part of a gentlemen's agreement
that gives the considerably less critical directorship of the World
Bank to an American.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, when European Union finance ministers formally
endorsed Caio Koch-Weser _ a Brazilian-born German official who has
spent most of his career at the World Bank _ the United States
promptly and bluntly rejected that choice.
</P>
<P>
   To appreciate why the Americans decided to be so ugly, you need
to understand that the head of the IMF is one of the most crucial
economic officials in the world, right up there with the chairman
of the Federal Reserve and the U.S. treasury secretary. The
managing director not only needs to be smart and experienced; he
also needs to be diplomatically forceful. It's not a job for an
ordinary bureaucrat.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, people who should know regard Koch-Weser as,
well, an ordinary bureaucrat. He is, by all accounts, intelligent
and likable. But he has spent his career at the wrong kind of
institution; the World Bank is not a place to get experience in
financial firefighting. More important, insiders I spoke to
described Koch-Weser as someone who got along by going along _
someone who never expressed strong ideas of his own, who always
seemed to say what he thought his superiors wanted to hear. That's
not exactly the kind of man you want in the hot seat when the next
global crisis breaks out.
</P>
<P>
   So why did the Europeans select such a weak candidate? That's
where the story gets awfully funny _ that is, it's funny, but it's
also awful.
</P>
<P>
   The problem begins with the French. France has long been an
ardent advocate of the idea of Europe _ a Europe led by Frenchmen.
And Paris has been ruthless in its determination to put its
nationals in charge of everything from the IMF to the European
Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, however, Europe's largest nation was going to
demand its turn. Given that a Frenchman has headed the IMF for the
last 22 years (and for 32 of the last 37 years!) the Germans
figured that it was about time they got a chance. The trouble was
that they didn't have any qualified candidates.
</P>
<P>
   No, they aren't a nation of dummkopfs; it's a question of
background. Germany does not have an elite civil service like the
French or the British; nor does it have the kind of
cross-pollination among business, academia and government that
produces a Robert Rubin or Larry Summers. Nobody I talked to could
come up with any German candidate he regarded as suitable for the
job. Koch-Weser was the best Germany could find _ and he wasn't
good enough.
</P>
<P>
   Even the British and the French made their disappointment clear,
withholding their endorsement for three months after the German
government began pushing Koch-Weser. What finally concentrated
their minds was the horrifying prospect that the job might actually
go to the right person.
</P>
<P>
   Last week a coalition of developing countries forced the issue
by formally nominating Stanley Fischer, the IMF's first deputy
managing director. Fischer (a former teacher and colleague of mine)
has every conceivable qualification but one. An eminent economist,
he is also an experienced policy maker _ he was the point man in
the Asian crisis _ who has been noteworthy for his tact, discretion
and ability to stay cool under fire. Even those who have criticized
some of the IMF's decisions regard him as perfect for the job. But
though born in what is now Zambia, Fischer is a naturalized U.S.
citizen.
</P>
<P>
   That apparently does not bother the African, Latin American and
Middle Eastern (!) nations that have championed his candidacy. But
the Europeans want a European, though most of them don't really
want Koch-Weser. (Everyone suspects that Britain and maybe even
France were willing to give lip service to an unsatisfactory
candidate only because they counted on the Clinton administration,
which is having trouble defending the IMF against a hostile
Congress in any case, to veto him.)
</P>
<P>
   Now the truth is that there are plenty of qualified Europeans;
there are citizens of Britain, Italy, Sweden, Poland who could do
the job. Still, one wonders: Is it too late for Fischer to acquire
a German passport?

 &HT;    Shot-putter: Bigger is better
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the big problems that female shot-putters face in selling
their discipline is their size.
</P>
<P>
   The guys can get away with being bulked-up behemoths.
</P>
<P>
   Cover girl/beach volleyball player Gabrielle Reece can earn a
handsome living off her image and book by the same title, ``Big
Girl in the Middle.''
</P>
<P>
   But a female shot-putter is looked at funny. The unlady-like
stigma lingers.
</P>
<P>
   For Connie Price-Smith, the stigma was there the day she picked
up a shot almost two decades ago. It's been there on three trips to
the Olympic Games and more international competitions than she can
remember. And it will follow her Saturday to the Georgia Dome,
where she's favored to win a fifth title in the USA Indoor Track
and Field Championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a stigma,'' said Price-Smith, ranked as the
No. 1 women's shot-putter in the United States for the past nine
years. ``You have to be strong, and it's usually the bigger girls.
Everyone is going to perceive we're not as pretty or feminine as
the sprinters or pole-vaulters. Shot-putters come in all shapes and
sizes. If you look across the board, they're more feminine than in
the past, but the stigma probably will always be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of shrug it off and don't think abut it. If you worry,
you'll just be frustrated. I know a lot of girls have problems with
it. I'm blessed with the size I have, and I do the best with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The pleasant, soft-spoken woman has been among the elite
American throwers since she came to the sport, ranking in the top
10 every year since 1986. Price-Smith won nine outdoor U.S.
shot-put titles and four indoors, not to mention six national
discus titles and a silver medal in the shot put at the World
Indoor Championships _ the best showing by an American woman in the
event and the first Olympic or world championship medal won since
1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ultimate hope is to make another Olympic team and do well
(in Sydney). (And) I'd like to win another indoor title.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, this country's leading shot-putter will call it a career.
</P>
<P>
   She's thought about retirement before, but this time it's for
real.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing this for a long time,'' said Price-Smith,
defending Pan American Games champion. ``It gets harder and harder
at 37 to get up and fight every day. After '88, I said I would
retire. After '92, I said I would retire. After '96, I didn't feel
that way. I decided after '96 I would go four more years. I wanted
to be in four Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to go on to another life after this. I think I'd
like to start a family. I'm not getting any younger.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty of the sport in recent years has been staying
mentally focused, but Price-Smith is renewed by thoughts of a final
Olympic shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's very motivational, and I work harder because of it,''
she said. ``I'm excited. I think my chance (of an Olympic medal)
are pretty good. I can throw as well as a majority of the people in
the world. It's who is ready on that day. But the important thing
is to make the (U.S.) team and take care of the rest later.''
</P>

EX-BROKERS SUE OVER COMPANY STOCK PURCHASE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Sometimes even stockbrokers succumb to a hard sell on a
stock _ and lose a pile of money in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Former Massachusetts employees of Salomon Smith Barney Inc. say
they were pressed by their managers to show their loyalty by
investing a portion of their wages in the Wall Street broker's
stock. The plan was touted as a form of golden handcuffs, an
enticement for employees to stay aboard for at least two years to
reap potential gains from the stock.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality was more like iron shackles, former employees
say.
</P>
<P>
   In a class-action lawsuit filed recently in state Superior
Court, Maxwell Peckler, a former broker for Smith Barney in Boston,
claims he lost $24,737 when he quit last year for another job.
Because he left less than two years after signing up for the
restricted stock, Peckler not only lost his rights to the shares,
but to the cash he had used to buy them.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of other brokers who have left the firm in recent years
have suffered the same fate, Peckler's lawyers say. Class-action
suits in five states pit the former Smith Barney brokers against
the firm's parent Citigroup Inc., in a multimillion-dollar fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simply unfair to ask an employee to participate in this
plan and not give him or her back their own personal contribution
when they leave,'' said Michael Collora, whose Boston law firm,
Dwyer &AMP; Collora, is handling the case. ``It restricts their
employment, and it benefits the employer unduly.''
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney argues that the plan was entirely voluntary
and that brokers signed forms acknowledging they understood they
would leave the stock and cash on the table if they quit before the
two years were up.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Sally Cates said participants enjoyed an ``immediate
benefit'' from the plan, because they were able to buy shares at a
25 percent discount. ``It's an agreement. It's completely
voluntary,'' Cates said.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, a California lawsuit paved the way for the Bay
State case. In that suit, a state judge ruled that Citigroup and
its subsidiary, Travelers Group Inc., had violated California's
labor laws by using the so-called Capital Accumulation Plan to keep
employees from changing jobs. Citigroup is appealing the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, similar cases have been filed against Salomon Smith
Barney and Citigroup in Florida, New Jersey, and New York. Former
employees across the country are contending that the company
pocketed tens of millions of dollars in workers' earnings when
employees quit.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Chin, a New Jersey lawyer who is handling the class action
in that state, said employees nationwide have forfeited 4.5 million
shares of stock in three years. That would amount to about $232
million worth, using Tuesday's closing price of $51 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   The former brokers contest the company's insistence that their
purchases were voluntary. For certain management-level employees,
buying stock was mandatory, they say. Brokers were pressured twice
a year to put as much as 25 percent of their pay into the stock
program, the Massachusetts suit alleges, ``as a sign of loyalty and
as an implied prerequisite to promotion and advancement.''
</P>
<P>
   A copy of one of Peckler's stock agreements, filed with the
court documents, states that completed forms had to be submitted to
branch managers. Failing to sign up brought trouble, said lawyer
David Bunis of Dwyer &AMP; Collora. ``They put the arm on people to
participate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers involved in the suits say they are looking into whether
branch managers had incentives to persuade their employees to sign
up. Cates said there were no incentives.
</P>
<P>
   The case is wide-reaching because it could involve as many as
10,000 employees and former employees of Salomon Smith Barney and
Travelers. Insurance agents who sell Travelers products could also
be affected, because some of them participate in the restricted
stock plan, said Collora, the Boston lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts suit seeks reimbursement for past employees.
The plaintiffs are also trying to change the way the plan works, so
current employees won't have to forfeit their wages if they leave.
</P>
<P>
   Under Massachusetts law, Bunis said, employers must pay an
employee all wages on the day he leaves the job. Any contract that
tries to flout that law is illegal, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules of Smith Barney's stock plan, the only sure ways
to avoid leaving two years' wages behind are to die or to be fired
without cause.

WHEN BEST-LAID PLANS FAIL, IMPROVISE A TRIFLE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What do you do when it's 6:30 p.m. and you have just discovered
that the fancy custard you were planning to serve 12 people at
dinner is still sloshing around instead of standing firm?
</P>
<P>
   Remaking the dessert is out of the question: not enough time.
For me, running to the store and buying a substitute was one
possibility, but I knew I wouldn't fool anyone. It's a little hard
to get away with serving a store-bought dessert when you are a food
writer, especially when the party has been planned five months in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   So I started improvising a dessert in my head. I knew I had a
12-egg-white disk of meringue in the kitchen, left over from the
creme brulee that I had left on the stove for a second too long. I
thought the meringue could be the base of a trifle, and as I drove
to the store I envisioned the other ingredients: heavy cream to
whip, mascarpone to use as a thickener, poached dried cranberries
for tartness and ladyfingers soaked in Marsala wine. As I dashed
through the store I spied a jar of lemon curd and added it to the
still evolving dessert.
</P>
<P>
   I folded the mascarpone and lemon curd into the whipped cream
along with the cranberries, and stirred in some Marsala. The
components were arranged and layered. It looked great. I served it,
and it tasted OK, but I knew there was a better dessert lurking in
there.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later my son, Michael, who owns a restaurant in
Spain, was visiting, and we decided to play with the original
dessert. We tried various combinations of coffee-flavored liqueur,
sherry and creme fraiche.
</P>
<P>
   We got rid of the meringue, substituted toasted pecans for the
cranberries to add some crunch, changed the too-sweet Marsala to
very dry sherry and soaked each ladyfinger in it, and added lemon
rind and lemon juice for tartness. We named the new creation
Emergency Trifle.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, we decided that creme fraiche would do as well
as mascarpone and that very strong coffee mixed with a little
coffee liqueur could be used in place of the sherry.
</P>
<P>
   We also decided that if savoiardi, the much firmer and larger
Italian ladyfingers, are too hard to find, American ladyfingers can
be substituted. When you are in a hurry you can't be too fussy.
</P>
<P>
   EMERGENCY TRIFLE  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 25 minutes  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   16 ounces mascarpone
</P>
<P>
   2 pints heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   \ cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   Finely grated peel of one large lemon
</P>
<P>
   1} cups dry (fino) sherry
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   2 cups chopped, toasted, lightly salted pecans
</P>
<P>
   1 8- to 11-ounce jar lemon curd
</P>
<P>
   30 or more Italian ladyfingers (savoiardi)
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate-covered espresso beans, grated lemon rind, curls of
lemon rind, jellied lemon slices for garnish (optional).
</P>
<P>
   1. In a bowl, beat mascarpone to soften it. Add cream, sugar and
lemon peel, and beat until mixture is partly thickened. Slowly beat
in lemon juice and } cup of the sherry, and continue beating until
the mixture is thick.
</P>
<P>
   2. Fold in the pecans. Stir in lemon curd so that it makes
streaks in the whipped cream mixture.
</P>
<P>
   3. Quickly dip the ladyfingers one by one on both sides into
remaining sherry; do not allow them to soak in sherry or they will
become mushy. Place some to fill the bottom of a 12-cup
straight-sided glass bowl. Place additional ladyfingers side by
side, standing up, around sides of bowl. Spoon in half the whipped
cream mixture. Arrange remaining ladyfingers on top of whipped
cream; top with remaining whipped cream. Finish with garnish of
your choice. Refrigerate if desired.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 12 servings.

McCAIN TO PARTICIPATE IN GOP DEBATE 
 
By GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRESNO, Calif. _ Presidential hopeful John McCain abruptly
reversed a decision Tuesday not to debate Gov. George W. Bush this
week, saying he would change his schedule to participate by
satellite hookup in the Los Angeles forum.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign responded that it would participate ``one way
or another,'' either by satellite or in person.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times and CNN are sponsoring a Democratic debate
with Al Gore and Bill Bradley on Wednesday night and a Republican
presidential debate Thursday. Conservative commentator Alan Keyes
will also participate in the GOP debate. Both debates will be
broadcast live at 9 p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
   McCain complained that the debate could ``hurt'' him with voters
in New York because it will force the cancellation of a rally there
Thursday night, which was scheduled before he and Bush worked out
their scheduling problems.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement surprised reporters, who had asked him only an
hour before if he planned to pass up a chance to debate the Texas
governor. McCain said there was ``no possible way'' he could
rearrange his schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot flex our schedule just because George W. Bush is
blown by the electoral winds,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   But a few hours later, the Arizona senator apologized and
reversed course. He said he felt no obligation to share ``the inner
workings and contemplation of our campaign'' with reporters who
travel with him aboard his ``Straight Talk Express'' bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``From now on, straight talk,'' he laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said the campaign ``tore up our
entire schedule to go back to California.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said if it is possible to attend the debate by satellite,
then Bush will probably do that and continue to campaign somewhere
in the East on that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will participate one way or another,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain acknowledged the importance of the California primary,
with its winner-takes-all delegate prize of 162.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I need to win California. It's a critical state,'' McCain
told a small crowd in Stockton early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Later he told packed auditorium at California State University
in Fresno that he was optimistic, although conservative Republicans
have so far shown little sign of responding in great numbers to his
message.

   CARNAVAL-BRAZIL (Salvador, Brazil) _ Carnaval in Salvador, the
state capital of Bahia, is purely a street carnaval, different from
the Folies Bergeres-like televised festivities that take place in
Rio de Janeiro. The music played on top of the trio eletrico _ it's
usually the popular new Brazilian samba-reggae or axe music _ has a
direct relationship to the street and takes part in a kind of
natural selection: each year carnaval starts with dozens of songs
written specifically for the festivities, and by the end of the
week that repertory has been narrowed to a handful. The trio
eletrico is the medium, and the street decides. By Ben Ratliff. &QL;

   DYLAN-MUSIC (Undated) _ When Bob Dylan was an acerbic young folk
singer warning that the times were a-changin', one change he
probably did not envision was that he would become a darling of the
high-art world. Yet last fall, nearly 40 years after he made his
first records, Dylan was declared one of the greatest artists of
the 20th century by Andrew Motion, the British poet laureate. And
now the composer John Corigliano, commissioned to write a song
cycle for the soprano Sylvia McNair's Carnegie Hall recital on
March 15, has produced ``Mr. Tambourine Man: Seven Songs of Bob
Dylan,'' a 35-minute song cycle. By Allan Kozinn. &QL;

   CHARLES-ATLAS-ART (New York) _ In the last 30 years, Charles
Atlas has created scores of videos, films, performances and set and
lighting designs for opera, theater and dance. This Friday through
April 1 he returns to the Kitchen, in Manhattan, where he first
performed a short dance in a 1974 series that also featured the
artists Joan Jonas and Hannah Wilke. His current appearance is as a
video-installation artist with two new works, ``As If You Like It''

   TURKEY-ART (Istanbul, Turkey) _ There is bad news for anyone
planning to visit Turkey this year. The velvet-lined case that
houses the country's most famous artifact, the glittering Topkapi
dagger, will be empty. Nor will visitors be able to see the curved
battle sword that hung from Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror's hip when
his army captured Constantinople in 1453, or the inlaid
ebony-and-ivory throne from which the vast Ottoman Empire was once
ruled, or the dazzling emerald-studded turban decoration that awed
visitors to the court of Sultan Ahmed I in the 17th century. The
good news, however, is that these objects and more than 200 others,
some of which have never before left the Topkapi Palace, will be
missing because they will be on tour through the United States.
They are part of one of the most ambitious exhibitions of Ottoman
treasures ever assembled. The exhibition, called ``Palace of Gold
and Light: Treasures From the Topkapi, Istanbul,'' opened on
Wednesday at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington. By Stephen

   RENZO-PIANO-ARCH (Paris) _ Renzo Piano chuckled as he remembered
how he and Richard Rogers were ``young boys, really young and quite
bad boys'' in 1971 when they won the architecture competition for
the Georges Pompidou Center with a design that they considered a
parody of technology. Even now, at 62, Piano, a good-natured
Italian, seemed amazed that France allowed two young foreigners _
he was 33 and his British partner was 37 _ to challenge the sober
18th-century stone facades of eastern Paris with an immense
metallic structure variously described (by its critics) as a
refinery or an ocean liner and (by its architects) as ``a Jules
Verne spaceship that can't fly.'' The Pompidou Center, which opened
in 1977, proved immensely popular and today it (italics)is(end

architectural honors, including the highly regarded Pritzker Prize
in 1998. By Alan Riding. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Broadway's historic theaters have been named for
actors and actresses, playwrights and critics, producers and
patrons of the arts. Not until Tuesday have any of them been named
for airline companies.
</P>
<P>
   But in an $8.5 million dollar deal that may well foreshadow the
corporate renaming of a host of Broadway houses, the nonprofit
Roundabout Theater Company is rechristening the venerable Selwyn
Theater on 42nd Street the American Airlines Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Winter Garden Theater, where ``Cats'' is expected
to close in June after nearly 18 years, may soon become the
Cadillac Theater or the Cadillac Winter Garden. The Shubert
Organization, which owns the theater, has been in discussions with
General Motors about the possibility of such a deal.
</P>
<P>
   And with some trepidation over whether widespread corporate
renaming will cheapen the theater district, officials at Broadway's
two other major chains say they are open to putting the logos of
corporations and products on their theaters as well.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists may shudder at the thought of corporations'
buying their way onto the marquees, but theater owners and
marketing experts say these alliances will grow and could become a
widespread and lucrative practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to change both the face and the economics of
Broadway,'' said Lindsey Gruson, the president and chairman of
STET, a marketing group that has been advising the Shuberts on the
Cadillac deal. ``It's a marriage made in heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   But even among some of those who would stand to benefit
financially there is uneasiness. ``The name of the game is
maximizing the value of your assets and branding them,'' said Rocco
Landesman, president of Jujamcyn, which owns five Broadway
theaters. ``But if you take a long-term view of our properties, we
certainly have other interests besides that, like maintaining the
dignity and quality of the experience of going to the theater and
protecting the buildings and protecting the American theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just marketers,'' Landesman continued. ``We're also
producers and custodians of a proud theatrical tradition. The
Walter Kerr still sounds a lot better to me than `the AT&AMP;T.'''
</P>
<P>
   The interest has arisen since Times Square's recent
transformation into a family-friendly destination as well as a wave
of corporate namings of sports stadiums, bowl games, shopping
centers and out-of-town theaters that left the historic Broadway
houses, almost all of which have official New York City landmark
status, intact. Only 42nd Street's combined and rebuilt Lyric and
Apollo playhouses took on a corporate name _ the Ford Center for
the Performing Arts _ when Livent Inc., opened the house with
`Ragtime'' in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Money, of course, is driving the naming trend. Roundabout's deal
with American provides for the airline _ represented by the
marketing firm Entertainment Management Group (EMG), which has
handled several musical tours and Broadway productions _ to
contribute $850,000 a year to the theater over a period of 10
years. The funds will help underwrite the operations of the
35-year-old Roundabout, which has an annual budget of about $20
million. The Selwyn, which was built in 1918 by Edgar and Arch
Selwyn, has been renovated at a cost of $21 million over the last
two years. To date the company has raised about $17.5 million from
donors including the city, board members and subscribers. It will
open for use on April 11 with previews of a new production of
Chekhov's ``Uncle Vanya.''
</P>
<P>
   American's name will remain on the marquee for the duration of
the partnership as well as on other materials associated with
theater, including all tickets and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Haimes, the artistic director of the Roundabout company,
said that naming the refurbished house the American Airlines
Theater seemed no different to him than naming it for an individual
benefactor, as the company did when it named a theater after Laura
Pels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wonderful that a major corporation would support
the arts and want their name on our theater,'' Haimes said. ``I
don't have a philosophical problem with it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   An executive at American, which has attached its name to sports
arenas in Miami and Dallas, said the naming would underscore its
presence in New York, where it has begun construction on a $1.3
billion terminal at John F. Kennedy Airport. ``It's one of our most
important markets,'' said Tom Gleason, the regional vice president
for American's eastern division. ``We wanted to look at a different
way of being part of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   The theater's focus on classics and musical revivals already
reduces the risk of controversial content, but what happens if the
Roundabout's artistic content comes into conflict with the
airline's corporate agenda?
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly made it completely clear that we have to have
complete control over what appears on our stage,'' Haimes said.
``And they were completely comfortable with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Birch, a senior vice president at Octagon Marketing in
Stamford, which has been working with the Shuberts, said that
Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert organization, had been
urged by his friend Gruson, a former correspondent for The New York
Times, to reach out for corporate alliances.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld said the deal was nowhere near consummation and
declined to discuss details. ``This is a matter that has to be
submitted to the board here,'' he said. ``I cannot tell you
anything now.''
</P>
<P>
   Birch said he was fairly certain that the Shubert partnership
with General Motors would come to pass, though he said he suspected
that the Shubert Organization would leave the names of most of its
16 theaters intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're going to do it,'' Birch said. ``You never know
what's going to happen, but we have met about it a few times and
it's clear that the concept works.''
</P>
<P>
   Birch said that the theater in general offers corporations an
attractive group of upscale, cultured consumers. ``I think they
realize that theater is a great target market and it's relatively
uncluttered,'' Birch said of Cadillac.
</P>
<P>
   Gust Kouvaris, a managing director at GM RWorks, a promotion and
special events company, who has been involved in the discussions,
did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the Shubert organization was a particularly
attractive partner because in addition to its theaters it owns
Telecharge, the telephone ticket service. ``They own a lot of
terrific, leverageable assets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This, Birch said, means that Shubert has a direct line to
theatergoers by mail and telephone, providing a company like
General Motors with easy access to potential customers. ``One could
ask them, `Would you be willing to take a test drive of an
automobile to get a free ticket along with one you buy?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, these developments are a logical extension of
the growing corporate presence on Broadway, which includes new
producers like Disney, Cablevision and SFX Entertainment, which
about a year ago renamed the Palace Theater in Chicago the Cadillac
Palace. Livent, which had a short life on Broadway, led the
corporate naming drive by setting up Ford Centers not only in New
York but in Chicago, Vancouver and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Broadway establishment has turned increasingly to a
corporate marketing. The League of American Theaters and Producers
has established partnerships with as the ``official airline of
Broadway'' and with Visa U.S.A. as the ``preferred card of
Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Minskoff theater, where ``Saturday Night Fever'' is
playing, the Nederlanders have made a deal with Mercedes-Benz to
place a car in the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole issue of sponsorship is becoming an active
conversation for all theater owners,'' said Nick Scandalios,
executive vice president of the Nederlander Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Scandalios said his company would nevertheless tread lightly in
deciding whether to rename any of its nine theaters. ``It's always
a tricky thing,'' he said. ``We certainly aren't going to look at
renaming the Richard Rodgers and put a beer title over it. You have
to look at the value of a name.''

MCCAIN SAYS HE'LL DEBATE BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKTON, Calif. _ Resolving a protracted game of political
chicken, Senator John McCain said Tuesday he would, after all, be
prepared to change his plans to participate in a debate Thursday
with Texas Governor George W. Bush and Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   For several days, aides for McCain and Bush have been firing
shots at each other over McCain's decision to skip the Los Angeles
Times/CNN debate. McCain said he was under the impression Bush had
declined to participate, so he had already scheduled other events
in New York. Aides to Bush said McCain was simply trying to avoid a
debate in California.
</P>
<P>
   McCain scoffed at that suggestion, and back and forth it went.
</P>
<P>
   The sniping, and McCain's reversal, underlined the importance of
this state to both Republican candidates. California, which
delivers 162 delegates to the victor, holds its primary next
Tuesday, along with New York, Ohio and 13 other states.
</P>
<P>
   California would appear to be fertile ground for McCain, who has
positioned himself as the more moderate candidate in the field, and
attracted independents and Democrats to the polls in other states.
</P>
<P>
   But he trails Bush by 20 points in a recent Field poll here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard hill to climb,'' said McCain's California
strategist Ken Khachigian. ``But time is on our side. Though the
clock is running.''
</P>
<P>
   He said McCain would spend 60 percent of the next week in
California. McCain will spend a day and a half in New York, shoring
up his support, he said. A recent Zogby poll in New York shows
McCain leading Bush by a few points.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether his bid for the Republican nomination would be
over if he lost California, McCain reluctantly conceded it might.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so unpredictable it depends on the scenario,'' he said
aboard his bus. ``Again, maybe a little bit of a return to Straight
Talk Express. Lets not kid anybody, it's very important and to
understate that is just not a recognition of reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign was far more bullish on California a couple
of weeks ago. But Tuesday, after the poll numbers appeared to put
McCain far behind, media strategist Mike Murphy downplayed the
importance of a victory there.
</P>
<P>
   He said it might not be absolutely vital, especially if McCain
sweeps New England, wins the New York primary, and returns to
``fertile ground'' in the North and the West.
</P>
<P>
   But to avoid that extra high-stakes scenario, McCain is pushing
in California something that might resonate more strongly: his
chances of success in a general election against the vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``My message to California Republicans is simple,'' he said
after a town hall meeting here. ``If you want to win back the
presidency, and make our ticket strong. Listen to people who have
supported me in other states. I seek not just to redeem our
integrity and pride, but to rebuild our party's strength. I want
California Republicans to know that we will at last start winning
again.''
</P>
<P>
   If he fails to win the delegates in California, however, McCain
may have another chance.
</P>
<P>
   Under new rules, all the candidates will be on the California
ballot this year, and all registered voters will be able to vote
for candidates from either party. But only votes from registered
Republicans will count toward the selection of the GOP winner, who
takes all the state's delegates.
</P>
<P>
   So, even if Independents vote for McCain, as they did in New
Hampshire, their votes will not count toward the nomination. It is
possible McCain could win the popularity contest in this state, but
lose the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the beauty contest, would be ``like kissing your
sister,'' said veteran California GOP strategist Ken Khachigian.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, McCain and his aides are giving the beauty
contest a second look: If the senator wins the blanket primary and
not the delegates, they say, perhaps that would give the Republican
Party enough pause to change the rules and look seriously at McCain
as the nominee despite the Republican tally.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I won the popular vote and Bush won the Republican vote,
then within the Republican Party there would have to be a
discussion: do you want somebody who just wins Republican votes, or
all of the votes?'' Khachigian said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his aides repeatedly said that all this speculation
is premature.
</P>
<P>
   In California, McCain has been pushed on social issues like
abortion just as hard as he was in South Carolina, where he lost to
Bush. But in the Golden State, the questions come from the other
end of the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   On his bus between Stockton and Fresno, McCain was grilled by
reporters about his attitude toward abortion, legal rights for gay
and lesbian couples and his views on whether they should be able to
adopt children.
</P>
<P>
   He took a firm conservative line on all issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe marriage should be simply those between heterosexual
couples as far as legal recognition. What they want to do with
their private lives is obviously not my affair and not my
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he thought homosexuality was a sin, he said ``I
leave that judgment up to theologians.''
</P>
<P>
   He was asked once about his attitude to gay adoptive parents,
and he said he didn't think that was a good idea. Three questions
later, he interrupted a reporter's unrelated question to make his
point more firmly: ``I do not support the adoption of children by
gays and lesbians,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also opposed federal funding for the arts, he said, but would
consider block grants to the states instead. But not for certain
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never support Mr. (Robert) Mapplethorpe's project, or
a number of others I find shameful and offensive as do an
overwhelming majority of my constituents. It is not art to put a
cricifix in a jar of urine, and if it is art, then fine, don't use
my constituents' tax dollars to pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps mindful of offending more liberal voters, McCain
repeatedly refused to go any deeper into his views on these
subjects. Asked over and over why he thinks gays should not have
the same rights as heterosexual couples, he answered: ``I just
don't think it's appropriate.''

AKAMAI TO INVEST $5M IN LOUDEYE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Akamai Technologies Inc., the 1999 IPO juggernaut that still has
venture-capital backers bragging, made a venture investment of its
own last week.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai, which is in the business of speeding up the Web,
promised to invest $5 million in Seattle's Loudeye Technologies
Inc. This is Akamai's first private-equity investment in an outside
company.
</P>
<P>
   Loudeye, formerly called encoding.com, is an Internet
infrastructure company whose product improves sound and video over
the Web. As part of the deal, Akamai said it would use Loudeye's
technology in its content-delivery business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digital media is not easy to create, encode, manage, or
deliver,'' Akamai President Paul Sagan said in a press
release &UR;  &LR; from the company's Cambridge, Mass. headquarters. By
working with Loudeye, he added, audio and video on the Web will
become more engaging.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai has made two acquisitions in its four months as a public
company, but this is its first pure investment. Earlier this month,
the company bought InterVU Inc., a provider of live radio and
broadcasting services over the Internet, for $2.8 billion. In
January, Akamai bought Network24 Communications for $200 million,
for its fast telecommunications connections that allow broadcasts
to move more quickly over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Dagres, a general partner with Battery Ventures, the
Wellesley venture capital firm that was Akamai's first investor,
said Akamai doesn't intend to become a big investor. But this deal
represents a trend among entrepreneurs, who often take key partners
on as investors, in addition to traditional venture investors and
large corporations.
</P>
<P>
   This is a late-stage investment in Loudeye. The company in
December said it had raised $48 million in its third round of
financing. Some big names showed up in that round, including
America Online, CBS, Intel, Microsoft, and NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's late in the game, Akamai and its investors stand to
profit when Loudeye goes public. The IPO is slated for March 7.
Loudeye plans to sell 4.5 million shares at $8 to $10 a share.
Akamai's closing stock price Tuesday was 261 1/4, up 4 1/2.

 &HT;    Bargain hunting revives blue chips
 &HT;    By Robert Luke
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Blue chip shares continued to bounce back Tuesday as
investors, such as Atlanta money manager James F. Barksdale, went
shopping for perceived bargains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our purchase opportunities today are the best we've seen since
the invasion of Kuwait in 1990, or the stock market crash of
1987,'' said Barksdale, who is president of Equity Investment
Corp., which manages portfolios for both individual and
institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market's decline has been broad and significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale noted that 75 percent of the 3,000 stocks in his
firm's investment universe _ companies that have been around for
more than five years with sales greater than $100 million _ are
trading below their 1997 highs.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so while it appears that the indexes over the past three
years have risen, in actuality most stocks have declined by a
lot,'' Barksdale said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed almost 90
points, or 0.89 percent, to finish at 10,128.31. The Dow is still
down almost 12 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 18.37 points, or 1.4
percent, to 1,366.42. It's down 7 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite set another high-water mark, on a
record-setting volume of 2.08 billion shares. The Nasdaq jumped
118.84 points, or 2.6 percent, to 4,696.69. It's up more than 15
percent year-to-date.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for that superior performance is that many technology
issues are traded on Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been flocking to technology stocks on the belief
they have brighter earnings growth prospects. To buy those shares,
they have been selling other stocks, such as those of retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Wal-Mart Stores, for example, have tumbled 29.5
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   The current market environment ``is a value manager's heaven and
a value manager's hell,'' Barksdale said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's heaven because there are so many great companies to buy
because they're cheap,'' he said. ``It's hell because they keep
going down as investors abandon the broader market to put money
into technology stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale admits some of his clients are uneasy as some of the
stocks he has purchased have continued to slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be looking at today and yesterday,'' Barksdale said.
``You have to be looking at tomorrow and the future.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted, for example, that the best time to buy real estate in
Atlanta was in 1992, when the market was depressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the right time to buy because you did extremely well
going forward,'' Barksdale said. ``That's the way with value stocks
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, Barksdale concedes there are dangers in buying
beaten-down stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to avoid buying purely because the price is down because
it's like catching a falling knife,'' Barksdale said.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce risk, he looks to buy shares of companies whose sales
and earnings growth remain intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would avoid companies that are struggling to get sales and
earnings up,'' Barksdale said. ``I found that earnings problems are
unusually more long-lived then you expect; and it's best to wait
until you see the inflection point where sales and earnings
momentum are beginning to rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't get the stock at the bottom, that's true,''
Barksdale added. ``But you avoid the opportunity cost of sitting
with something that is struggling with problems. And you also
decrease the risk of being wrong and losing money.''
</P>
<P>
   He also likes to buy stocks that are reasonably priced relative
to growth prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``My point here is that the market has gotten so high in certain
sectors that even when some companies come down in price, they
still aren't bargains.''
</P>
<P>
   And, when looking for bargains, ``you need to make sure it's a
company you know something about and understand,'' Barksdale said.
In the technology sector, for example, a stock can tumble when its
technology is obsolete, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So where is Barksdale putting his clients' money?
</P>
<P>
   In financial stocks such as Raymond James Financial and
Wachovia; and food and beverage issues such as ConAgra, the maker
of Healthy Choice food products; and Brown-Forman, the maker of
Jack Daniels whiskey.
</P>
<P>
   The Raymond James securities firm, for example, is trading at
about half its peak price two years ago, Barksdale observed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long-term growth rate is the real story here,'' he said.
``This is an extremely well-managed marketing-focused company with
a long-term growth rate of 16 percent per year. Yet it's selling at
9 times earnings.''

 &HT;    Phone charges to increase
 &HT;    By Amy Schatz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Local and long-distance phone charges will rise
slightly again today as part of a deal that lowered in-state
long-distance charges by about 5 cents a minute in September.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two months, local and long-distance telephone bills
have carried a notice that the Texas Universal Service Fund charge
would increase today by about half a percent. The increase has
already been figured into this month's phone bills.
</P>
<P>
   The Universal Service Fund subsidizes service by local phone
companies to consumers in high-cost rural areas and to a small
percentage of hearing-disabled and low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   For years, state policy was to keep local phone rates low
through a high ``access charge'' that long-distance companies paid
Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. to complete their long-distance
calls. That higher charge was justified, in part, as a way to pay
for rural and special phone services.
</P>
<P>
   But because that meant the access charge for in-state calls was
substantially higher than for interstate calls, long-distance
companies usually charged more for in-state calls. As a result, a
customer in Central Texas could pay more to call Dallas than to
call New York.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the 1980s and into the 1990s, long-distance
companies began to complain that the access charges were much too
high and distorted long-distance charges.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state authorities responded by creating the
Universal Service Fund at each level, fed by a separate charge on
both local and long-distance telephone bills. Still, in Texas the
access charge remained high compared to many other states.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature last year agreed to cut the access charge, thus
making possible lower in-state long-distance bills. But it also
decided to maintain the subsidy for serving rural areas and the
deaf by raising the state Universal Service Fund charges on all
telecommunications bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be better because we've taken subsidies out of
places where they don't work anymore,'' said Public Utility
Commission chairman Pat Wood.
</P>
<P>
   So in September, the Universal Service Fund surcharge was raised
from .787 percent to 3.579 percent and is charged on both local and
long-distance bills. In exchange, the cost of in-state long
distance service was dropped by about 4 cents a minute. The amount
of the decrease depends on the long-distance company.
</P>
<P>
   The switch was calculated to be as revenue neutral as possible,
Wood said. ``It's a wash. That's how it was intended to be,'' said
Wood. This way, ``customers will know what they're paying for.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups argue that the change is anything but fair to
people who don't call other parts of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businesses and very high end residential customers end up
saving a whole heck of a lot of money,'' said Janee Briesemeister,
senior policy analyst for Consumers Union's southwest office.
</P>
<P>
   With the Universal Service Fund charge assessed on every phone
bill, lower income customers who don't call long distance in the
state are paying higher phone bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another example of those who use the least service
getting hit with higher prices because of deregulation,'
Briesemeister said.
</P>
<P>
   The Universal Service rate increased again today because of
tinkering by the commission and phone companies on how the charges
are figured. The commission is not scheduled to review the charge
again for three years, although its possible that the rate could
decrease in the interim, said Wood.

HOLOCAUST LIBEL CASE PROMPTS RELEASE OF EICHMANN MEMOIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The prison memoir of Nazi leader Adolf Eichmann was
released by Israel Tuesday, providing a chilling first-person
account of ``the gruesome workings of the death machine'' of the
Holocaust and a fresh glimpse into the vain and self-absorbed man
who refused to admit his guilt before he was executed in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Israel had refused to release the 1,300-page document for 40
years and kept it locked in the national archive, seeing it as a
self-serving justification by the man known as the ``technician of
death'' that would be misused by denyers of the Holocaust.
Authorities also wanted to ensure that Eichmann's family could not
profit from its publication.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government reversed its position so that the memoir
could be used as evidence in a libel case being tried in London
that has become a landmark battle against efforts to deny or
minimize the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to release Eichmann's work _ until now available
only in excerpts to a handful of scholars _ was made in August, but
the government had planned to release it only after completing
extensive footnotes to challenge Eichmann's denials of personal
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   But that process was taking too too long to help defense
attorneys for American university professor Deborah Lipstadt, who
has been sued for libel by British historian David Irving.
</P>
<P>
   Irving claimed that Lipstadt, a history professor at Emory
Univerity in Atlanta, wrongly branded him a Holocaust denier in her
1994 book ``Denying the Holocaust: A Growing Assault on Truth and
Memory.'' Irving has said he does not deny that Jews were killed in
the Holocaust, but he has challenged the number of deaths and the
manner in which Nazi death camps worked. He said his reputation was
destroyed by Lipstadt and is seeking financial damages.
</P>
<P>
   Irving's central claim _ that the estimate of 6 million Jews
killed in the Holocaust is a gross exaggeration and that the Nazis
never used gas chambers to carry out mass murder _ has been
rejected as outrageous by many historians and scholars. In a
statement cited repeatedly at the trial, Irving said during a 1991
speech in Canada that, ``More women died in the back seat of Edward
Kennedy's car at Chapaquiddick than ever died in a gas chamber in
Auschswitz'' _ a reference to the 1969 accident that helped derail
the Massachusetts senator's presidential ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   The Eichmann memoir _ which depicts in gruesome detail what
Eichmann calls ``the greatest dance of death of all time'' _ is
expected to be a devastating piece of evidence in a case which has,
in effect, put the Holocaust itself on trial.
</P>
<P>
   The account, in places clinically autobiographical and at other
times a confusing, rambling discourse, contains grim details on
precisely how the Nazis perpetrated the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   In describing the killing at the Auschwitz death camp, for
example, Eichmann wrote of watching as a commander ``burned the
corpses on an iron grill, in the open air. He led me to a shallow
ditch where a large number of corpses had just been burned.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same section, he described how he drank alcohol to numb
himself after witnessing scenes like this one:
</P>
<P>
   ``As I arrived I saw a Jewish woman with a small child in her
arms in the ditch. I wanted to snatch out the child but a bullet
smashed into the child's skull. My driver wiped small pieces of
brain from my leather coat.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1,300-page document was penned by Eichmann during the months
of his trial in Israel that ended with his execution for crimes
against the Jewish people and humanity.
</P>
<P>
   It is hand-written in meticulous German script, the lines
straight and even on white notebook paper as they relate a jarring
juxtaposition of the mundane and the unspeakable, what author Hanna
Arendt referred to as the ``banality of evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Eichmann included precise instructions as to how his own ashes
should be ``divided into portions of one-seventh'' and to whom and
where they should be dispersed after he was cremated. From this
self-absorbed detail focus on his own death he shifted easily to
explaining in graphic detail how, in the death camps, ``round
cotton wool filters were soaked with this poison and thrown into
the rooms where the Jews were assembled. The poison was instantly
fatal.''
</P>
<P>
   Many historians have objected to the self-serving aspects of the
document, in which Eichmann painted himself, as he put it, as ``a
cog in the giant wheel of the Third Reich.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My position is the same as that of millions of others who had
to obey,'' he wrote. ``The difference is simply that I had a much
more difficult task to perform in carrying out my orders.''
</P>
<P>
   Eichmann was a door-to-door salesman peddling vaccuum cleaners
before he rose through the ranks of the Nazi party. Ultimately he
became head of the Department of Jewish Affairs, charged with the
deportation of Jews from across Europe into the death camps.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Segev, one of Israel's top historians and author of ``The
Seventh Million: the Israelis and the Holocaust,'' said, ``This is
a very important document, a senior official of the Nazi government
describing in great detail the extermination of the Jews. His own
role, he tries to diminish. And that of course is not that
interesting. But what is interesting is to read from someone who
knew it from within.''
</P>
<P>
   Segev said the Eichmann memoir is one of perhaps only three
documents that spell out the Nazi ``Final Solution'' in such detail
by one who helped carry it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be very significant at the trial because the detail is
there,'' said Segev, who fought with the Israeli government for
three years to try to force the release of the memoir. ``The
impression it leaves is a senior Nazi official telling you in his
own words, `This is what we did.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Observers have feared that verdict for Irving in the libel trial
would undercut the worldwide effort to ensure that the Holocaust
never happen again by documenting its horrors and educating the
public through somber memorials, museums, academic conferences,
films, and books. The movement for awareness and remembrance has
taken deep root in America and parts of Europe, but not without
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were (Irving) to prevail,'' noted the cover story in this
week's Jerusalem Report magazine, ``the fear is that he and people
like him would try to brandish the verdict as `proof,' confirmed by
a British court of law, that the Holocaust did not unfold as it
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Segev and other analysts said the release of Eichmann's memoir
comes amid a resurgence of a virulent strain of Holocaust denial in
Europe and throughout the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   They cite the highly publicized rise to power in Austria of
Freedom Party leader Joerg Heider, who has spoken admiringly of
some policies of Hitler's Germany, as part of the emergence of a
far right political culture in Europe that tends to gloss over the
evils of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   In many corners of the Arab world, Holocaust denial is pervasive
and can be heard from the Palestinian pulpits of Hamas' militant
Islamic sheiks to the Egyptian cafes of secular university
professors.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent glaring example was a scathing front-page attack
on Israel in the state-run Syrian daily newspaper, ``Tishrin.'' The
article, published in January as peace talks between Israel and
Syria stalled, branded the Holocaust a Zionist ``myth'' and said
Israeli policies toward Palestinians were ``far worse.''

<P>
   BEIJING _ At a time of high tension among China, Taiwan and the
United States, Taiwan's government is pressing Washington to sell
it some of the most advanced defensive weapons as part of an
ambitious new plan to counter China's growing military power.
</P>
<P>
   The request for weapons, including four elaborately equipped
warships costing more than $1.5 billion each, has already provoked
severe warnings from Beijing and has put the Clinton administration
in a serious political bind.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese diplomats have privately said that the warship sales in
particular will be regarded as serious violations of China's
national sovereignty and will create dangerous new tensions with
the United States as well as across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
   But Taiwan is determined to create a new shield against China's
expanding forces of ballistic and cruise missiles, officials in
Taipei said in interviews last week. An American refusal to sell
Taiwan the requested weapons would cause enormous bitterness on the
island, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is divided over the sales, which are
supported by some American military officers and Defense Department
officials as justified for Taiwan's defense but opposed by some
officials in the State Department and the National Security Council
as an unnecessary and risky provocation of China. Beijing regards
Taiwan as a part of China's sovereign territory, separated by civil
war.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton seeks better relations with China. But
refusing Taiwan's request would provide ammunition for Taiwan's
most ardent supporters in Washington, who want closer military ties
with Taiwan as a price for one of Clinton's major goals, China's
admission to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   While Taiwan officials were reluctant to comment directly on
their government's arms request, they did not mask their fervent
desire for the weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not so confident that if we are attacked, the United
States will be there,'' said Maj. Gen. Tyson G. Fu, director of
strategic studies at the Armed Forces University in Taiwan. ``So we
have adopted a stand-alone strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of a larger weapons request, Taiwan has asked the United
States to sell it four guided-missile destroyers equipped with
Aegis radar, tracking and battle management systems _ one of the
American military's most advanced warships and one never before
sold abroad completely equipped.
</P>
<P>
   A decision is expected by April, when the United States and
Taiwan hold annual talks on arms sales.
</P>
<P>
   The request comes at a critical time in American relations with
Taiwan and China, which have been strained by China's warning last
week that it can use force if Taiwan delays negotiations on
reunification indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   China's warning prompted new criticism in Washington and
appeared to bolster congressional support for the proposed Taiwan
Security Enhancement Act, which would deepen American military
contacts with Taiwan and is opposed by Clinton. The House passed
the legislation with bipartisan support earlier this month, and the
Senate is now considering it.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's debate over the arms sales, carried out in
private over issues that are as much political as military,
crystallizes all the contradictions in American policy toward
Taiwan, which the United States wants to protect from attack even
as it officially recognizes Beijing as the sole government of ``one
China.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've seen so much anxiety over a decision,`` a
senior administration official said, adding that the internal fight
had hardly begun.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of American forces in the Pacific, Adm. Dennis C.
Blair, who is now visiting China for discussions on Taiwan and
other issues, has supported the sale of destroyers, but not
necessarily with the elaborate Aegis system, officials in
Washington said. He has not yet made a formal recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Aegis-equipped warships, Taiwan has also
asked to buy batteries of the latest Patriot missiles, which are
ground-based interceptors, as well as advanced long-range radar.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan officials see the three purchases together as the core of
a new defensive shield, Fu said, and the Aegis system is considered
essential ``because it's mobile and more survivable than the
Patriot.''
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan has also requested diesel submarines, P-3 surveillance
aircraft and a variety of American missiles. But the request for
submarines is a perennial one and is certain to be denied.
</P>
<P>
   While China opposes any significant weapon sales to Taiwan, the
Aegis-equipped warship is the most controversial, because it would
involve a leap in Taiwan's technological level and because it could
also, experts say, someday be adapted for use in the kind of
upper-atmospheric missile defense that China has most vehemently
condemned.
</P>
<P>
   In private warnings to American scholars and diplomats, the
Chinese have vehemently warned against the sale of Aegis warships,
calling such a sale a violation of China's sovereignty and of
previous American agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, the United States is to
provide Taiwan only with defensive weapons ``in such quantity as
may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient
self-defense capability.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a 1982 agreement with China, President Reagan also pledged
not to increase the quantity or quality of arms sold to Taiwan and
said the United States would gradually reduce arms sales if the
mainland and Taiwan pursued a peaceful solution to their conflict,
a condition that some say Beijing has violated with its threats.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the State Department and White House have argued
that neither the Aegis system nor other ultra-sophisticated weapons
can buy Taiwan real security, which depends on negotiations and,
ultimately, American support.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the sale, including senior military officers,
counter that Taiwan has a good case. ``We are required to give
capabilities that help Taiwan defend itself,'' said a senior
administration official who favors the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, administration and Pentagon officials said, Clinton
may approve only part of Taiwan's request, rejecting the Aegis
destroyers but offering enough other weapons to avoid criticism
that the administration is not supporting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   In Taipei, officials stressed that they see a vital need for
advanced defenses, including the Aegis system on Arleigh Burke
missile destroyers, despite the enormous costs. The four ships
Taiwan has requested would cost $6.5 billion to build and equip,
according to officials in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan must act now, its officials say, to counter China's
build-up of ballistic missiles on its coast across from Taiwan, its
crash program to develop long-range cruise missiles and its recent
purchase of Russian destroyers.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's special interest in the Aegis system is not hard to
understand. American military experts said that Aegis was
originally designed to counter waves of cruise missiles, including
the Sunburn guided missiles carried on the four Russian destroyers
that China has ordered.
</P>
<P>
   With computers able to track many incoming threats at once and
coordinate responses, the Aegis system also combats incoming jet
fighters and warships.
</P>
<P>
   American experts say that China is right in contending that
Aegis could be adapted for use in a future, ``upper-tier'' defense
that spots incoming missiles early in their trajectory and targets
them high in the atmosphere or even above it _ the so-called
Theater Missile Defense that the United States and Japan are
working to develop and that China strongly opposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's true,'' agreed Fu, in Taipei, of the potentially
expanded use. ``But any excuse will serve a tyrant. The Chinese
even say the Patriots have offensive uses.''
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan officials insist that their proposals are based on
military need, but such requests inevitably take on a heavy
symbolic burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the United States turns us down, Taiwan's elite groups will
feel a very emotional bitterness,'' said a senior Taiwanese
national security official who spoke on the condition that his name
not be used. ``We have the money, and we think this is important to
our survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael D. Swaine, a military expert at the Rand Corp. in
California, said: ``There are those in Taiwan who see the Aegis
sale as a strong symbol of the United States commitment to
defending Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Aegis destroyer sales are approved, the first delivery
would not be for perhaps five years, followed by more years of
training and technical cooperation between the American and Taiwan
militaries to enable the systems' effective use.
</P>
<P>
   Learning to use the highly sophisticated Aegis ``is a tall order
for the Taiwanese from an operational point of view,`` Swaine said.
And otherwise, he said, the warships ``will just become big magnets
for Chinese missiles or torpedoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Such enhanced cooperation between the two militaries is, in
itself, a political goal of Taiwan and is strongly objectionable to
China.
</P>
<P>
   China's intense concern about the Aegis system arises in part
from the potential link to the broader anti-missile network the
United States and Japan are pursuing. China fears that if Taiwan
were included, not only would its best weapons be blunted, but
Taiwan's military would become closely integrated with American
forces in an effective alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the United States and Japan do develop an upper-tier
defense, then, from the bottom of our hearts, of course we'll want
to join,`` Fu said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But do you think China couldn't stop it?'' he asked, referring
to China's diplomatic prowess. ``They've kept us from purchasing a
submarine for a decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Causing new worries in Washington and Beijing, Taiwan's leaders
have recently spoken of developing a new, more aggressive deterrent
strategy, with a goal of fielding offensive weapons including
long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In a Dec. 8 speech on national security, Vice President Lien
Chan, who is the Nationalist Party candidate for president in the
March 18 elections, said, ``Our country must establish effective
deterrent forces so that Communist China won't dare take on
Taiwan,`` including ``the attacking potential of long-distance
surface-to-surface missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement angered American officials who are hoping to cool
tensions in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
   In Taiwan, there seems to be a near-consensus on military issues
among the three major contenders for president. The winner will
take office in May.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, which
has a history of advocating Taiwan's formal independence, might be
more hawkish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all agree that the best defense is a good offense,'' said
Parris Chang, a legislator from that party and one if its defense
experts, in an interview. ``Taiwan needs cruise missiles able to
reach Shanghai as a deterrent.''

 &HT;    UPS, Delta go nose to nose for right to fly to China
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two companies are involved in a dogfight over air
rights to China.
</P>
<P>
   United Parcel Service and Delta Air Lines are among seven air
carriers seeking new flights being awarded this year under the
U.S.-China air treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines filed formal applications Tuesday with the U.S.
Transportation Department.
</P>
<P>
   UPS ranks a China route as its ``top international priority,''
Chairman and Chief Executive Jim Kelly said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Sandy Springs, Ga.-based delivery giant says it needs air
rights to compete effectively for air express business with rival
FedEx, which already flies to China.
</P>
<P>
   UPS also told the DOT that direct flights to China would create
1,200 new jobs at the company, adding that the ``increased movement
of goods'' would generate more than 77,000 jobs in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Delta wants to fly passengers seven days a week
nonstop from New York to Beijing and three days a week nonstop from
Cincinnati to Beijing. The New York flights would originate in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Chairman Leo Mullin said the New York-Beijing market is
``by far the largest U.S.-China market without nonstop service,''
adding that the one-stop link to Delta's Atlanta hub would serve
``vast numbers of additional travelers.''
</P>
<P>
   The DOT will award 10 weekly flight frequencies and is expected
to issue a decision this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The case is unusual because it puts passenger and cargo airlines
in competition for the same flights. Usually, passenger and cargo
flights are awarded separately.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to UPS and Delta, applicants include American
Airlines and Polar Air Cargo, which have no flights to China.
FedEx, United and Northwest, which do, are seeking additional
flights.
</P>
<P>
   The DOT will name only one new entrant, creating a
winner-take-all battle for that distinction among UPS, Delta,
American and Polar. It also could split the new frequencies between
one new carrier and one of the incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   UPS last week set up a separate Web site, chinaquest.ups.com,
where it presents its arguments publicly.
</P>
<P>
   The delivery giant argues that FedEx has a monopoly to mainland
China that can only be broken if ``the DOT permits UPS to compete
on a level playing field.'' UPS serves China through third-party
delivery services, but that arrangement restricts growth and
reliability, a company spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Yohe, Delta's senior vice president for government
affairs, said Delta believes its proposal for passenger service
from New York is superior to that of American, which would fly from
Chicago. United already provides one-stop service from Chicago, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
   Yohe said the critical decision is whether the DOT makes cargo
or passengers the priority for new service.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had to handicap it, we really feel UPS is probably going
to be our strongest competition,'' Yohe said.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies' applications include long lists of supporters in
Congress and from various cities with a stake in the outcome. Two
members of Georgia's congressional delegation contacted Tuesday are
being careful not to choose sides between UPS and Delta.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Cleland and Rep. Mac Collins each have written letters
supporting UPS if the DOT decides to add cargo flights, and Delta
if it opts for more passenger service, spokespeople said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really does not favor one over the other,'' said an aide to
Cleland. ``It puts the entire delegation in a bind, really.''

 DeBEERS GUARANTEES ITS STONES DO NOT COME FROM REBELS   By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Stung by accusations that the diamond trade has
supported war against governments in Africa, De Beers, the giant of
the industry, said Tuesday that it would give written guarantees
that its stones do not come from rebel groups in the continent.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was the clearest statement so far of De Beers'
resolve to keep illicit stones out of its arcane selling process.
That system allows 125 approved dealers, mostly jewelry
manufacturers, to buy shoe-box size consignments of uncut diamonds
10 times a year from the company's stockpile in London.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers' announcement coincided with wider efforts by the
world's diamond industry as a U.N. panel prepares a report for next
month chronicling the use of diamonds to finance wars in Angola,
Sierra Leone, Congo and elsewhere. Illicit gems account for only a
small part of the global diamond market.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers, which had record sales of $5.24 billion last year, is
trying to strengthen the image of diamonds as a symbol of riches
and romance rather than a currency for the trade in arms, fuel and
other supplies that sustain conflicts in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers controls 70 percent of the world's trade in uncut
stones _ a position that enables it to dictate prices by regulating
the flow of diamonds from its Central Selling Organization in
London.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement said that as of its next formal sale on March
27, the De Beers selling arm, the Diamond Trading Co., would
include on its invoices a formal guarantee that its stones did
``not include any diamonds which come from any area in Africa
controlled by forces rebelling against the legitimate and
internationally recognized government of the relevant country.''
</P>
<P>
   The certificate will mean that the boxes sold by the Central
Selling Organization contain only gems bought from De Beers mines
in Botswana, South Africa and Namibia or bought from places like
Russia, Canada and government-controlled mines in Angola, said
Andrew Lamont, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement had little impact on De Beers stock in
Johannesburg, which fell 6.6 percent, to 139 rand, or about $22.06,
because of what analysts called a more general shift by investors
away from mineral industry shares. But the announcement was
welcomed by some of the company's critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``De Beers has taken a lead that the rest of the diamond
industry must now follow,'' said Charmian Gooch, director of Global
Witness, a group that had previously accused De Beers of failing to
use its influence to curb illicit trading.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts, however, questioned De Beers' motives, saying the
new plan reflected a long-term strategic shift toward selling only
De Beers-branded stones.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to create a clean brand image,'' said Christine
Gordon, a journalist and independent diamond industry analyst. ``De
Beers stands to lose nothing by this financially and has a great
deal to gain in public perceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon also said the move came when diamond sales by rebels from
Angola were substantially lower. Last year, she said, sales by
Angola's Unita rebels probably totaled some $160 million to $200
million, compared with $800 million in 1997 _ the year before the
United Nations imposed sanctions on Unita.

`SPORTS NIGHT,' `FREAKS' FANS: LET'S HUDDLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Campaigns to save ``Freaks and Geeks'' and ``Sports Night'' from
cancellation are gaining steam as the networks start to get serious
about what will and won't be on their schedules next fall.
</P>
<P>
   The lineups for the new fall season aren't decided until
mid-May, but devoted fans of the two well-regarded but underwatched
series know the handwriting on the wall reads: ``Don't bet on their
being renewed.'' The signs are as obvious as the nose on my face,
which is easier to spot than a network executive with something
definitive to say about either show. The evidence:
</P>
<P>
   _ Episodes of both shows were pulled during the November and
February ratings sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Sports Night,'' a sophomore series about the quirky people
who run a cable sports program, will end its season April 4, well
shy of the May ratings sweep when most shows have their
high-profile season finales.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Freaks and Geeks,'' a gentle satire of high school
cliquishness, has been off the air more than on this season. After
a strange launch last fall that featured only a handful of episodes
in a dreadful Saturday time slot, NBC shelved it for a January
relaunch on Monday nights. That strategy lasted only a few weeks
before the show was pulled again and placed on indefinite
suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports Night'' returned to the schedule Tuesday night with
little fanfare; NBC says ``Freaks and Geeks'' will be back March
13. Even though the networks never tip their hands as to whether an
acclaimed but low-rated show has a future, the treatment both have
received parallels the experiences of other series that have heard
warm-and-fuzzy platitudes from the network brass but, in the end,
became victims of the scheduler's swift sword.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone interested in rallying behind either show is encouraged
to do a little old-fashioned letter writing, because it is
generally assumed that e-mail and phone messages don't have the
same clout as a personally crafted, handwritten letter. Even typed
letters are considered uncool, since it's easy to assume a
typewritten plea was photocopied from a master form letter.
</P>
<P>
   Some other tips for fledgling save-our-show activists:
</P>
<P>
   _ Letters should be friendly, polite and brief. No 12-page term
papers; one page is plenty. Also, telling a network kahuna that he
or she has the brains of a kumquat isn't a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be positive. Give the network credit for putting the show on
the air in the first place and for keeping it on the air despite
lackluster ratings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Talk demographics, but be honest. For example, it's helpful if
the networks know you're a 45-year-old cummerbund salesman who
likes to watch ``Freaks and Geeks'' with your six teen-agers. Or
that you and your spouse are thirtysomething plaintiffs' attorneys
who only have time to watch two TV shows a week, and they happen to
be ``Sports Night'' and ``Freaks and Geeks.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Hand-address the envelope, but don't write the title of the
show on it. Network minions might toss it without giving it a
second look.
</P>
<P>
   _ Above all, be passionate. Tell the network how the show has
touched you emotionally, intellectually, spiritually, whatever.
</P>
<P>
   You can find sample letters on various Web sites, but it's
better to use your own words. For details about ``Freaks and
Geeks,'' check out
www.students.washington.edu/draheim/freaksandgeeks/. For ``Sports
Night,'' the Viewers for Quality Television Web site _
www.vqt.orgcq _ has some basic information.
</P>
<P>
   If writing about ``Freaks and Geeks,'' send it to Garth Ancier,
president; NBC Entertainment; 3000 W. Alameda Ave.; Burbank, CA
91523. NBC's viewer-relations comment line is 212-664-2333 (select
option 3). If you absolutely insist on sending e-mail: two viable
addresses are programming &LR; nbc.com and freaksandgeeks &LR; nbc.com.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Sports Night,'' write Stu Bloomberg, co-chairman; ABC
Entertainment Television Group; 2040 Avenue of the Stars; Century
City, CA 90067. ABC's audience information line is 212-456-7477
(option 4). Send e-mail to Stuart.Bloomberg &LR; abc.com or
netaudr &LR; abc.com.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of ``Sports Night'' also suggest it might be
worthwhile to write NBC and ask it to consider picking up the show
if ABC drops it. NBC executives are said to be fond of ``Sports
Night,'' which was created by Aaron Sorkin, the same guy who
created ``The West Wing,'' one of NBC's most popular new shows.

JUSTICES TACKLE VALIDITY OF POLICE SEARCHES IN GUN, DRUG CASES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Tuesday grappled with how far
police may go in searching people and their belongings for guns and
drugs, without having a warrant or reason to suspect any crime has
taken place.
</P>
<P>
   The justices heard arguments in two criminal cases: one
challenging the validity of a police officer's reliance on an
anonymous tip and the other addressing the constitutionality of a
federal agent squeezing a person's luggage without a warrant.
</P>
<P>
   In the anonymous tip case, the court considered whether Miami
police Officer Carmen Anderson was justified in summarily frisking
a teen-ager on a street corner based solely on information from an
unknown source. The mysterious tipster said only that a black youth
in a plaid shirt was standing in front of a pawn shop with two
friends and carrying a gun.
</P>
<P>
   In a Texas case, the high court weighed whether the Constitution
allowed Border Patrol agent Cesar Cantu to squeeze the luggage of a
bus passenger in Sierra Blanca, without either the owner's consent
or suspicion that a crime had been committed.
</P>
<P>
   Both searches proved fruitful: The frisk revealed a firearm, and
the luggage inspection uncovered methamphetamine. Attorneys for the
defendants argued before the justices that police in both cases
violated their clients' constitutional right to be free from
unreasonable searches.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, in hearing the appeals, weighed the delicate
balance between the constitutional right of citizens to be free
from unreasonable searches and the need for law enforcement to
protect the public from dangerous crime.
</P>
<P>
   The cases brought directly before the court the
constitutionality of the often aggressive efforts of police to keep
guns and drugs off the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The high court in recent years has interpreted that
constitutional right, contained in the Fourth Amendment, narrowly
and has given police ever-increasing latitude to search individuals
and their possessions for evidence of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, in their consideration of the two cases, appeared
poised to continue that trend.
</P>
<P>
   Many justices showed strong support for the prosecutors who
argued that the officers were justified in frisking one suspect for
guns and squeezing the other's luggage in search of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Justice David H. Souter, for example, rejected the Florida
defense attorney's argument that police should not be allowed to
rely solely on anonymous tips before searching a suspect for a
weapon. Souter said officers, upon being told that a bomb had been
planted in a crowded school, might be justified in immediately
checking student's belongings,``Fourth Amendment or no Fourth
Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   But several justices questioned prosecutors on whether the
officers should have been more respectful of the suspects' rights.
Justice John Paul Stevens, for example, told the attorney for the
Border Patrol that people have a reasonable expectation that their
private belongings will remain private.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Florida Attorney General Michael Neimand argued that
officer Anderson's concern for public safety justified her frisking
the boy without a warrant or suspicion that a specific crime was
committed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dealing with a dangerous weapon,'' Neimand said,
referring to the tipster's message that the boy, identified in
court papers as ``J.L.,'' was carrying a gun. While officers must
respect the Fourth Amendment, they also must consider the
``totality of the circumstances'' and conclude that an armed
suspect presents a threat to the public, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Solicitor General Irving Gornstein, pressing the
Clinton administration's support for Florida, said police can make
``common-sense judgments'' about the reliability of an anonymous
tip and the potential danger a suspect presents to the public.
</P>
<P>
   But assistant public defender Harvey Sepler, representing J.L.,
said the Constitution requires that police reasonably suspect that
a person is engaged in illegal activity before they conduct a
frisk.
</P>
<P>
   If police could act simply on a ``bald allegation'' that someone
is carrying a gun, nobody would be safe from being frisked by
officers, added Sepler, an assistant public defender in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you've got to say is `He's got a gun,''' Sepler added.
``Anybody, anywhere can be stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Texas case, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld
the luggage search.
</P>
<P>
   Luggage owner Steven Dewayne Bond, as a passenger on a bus, must
have expected that luggage placed in an overhead bin would be
touched by fellow passengers, and possibly law enforcement
officials, the 5th Circuit said. The court upheld Bond's conviction
on drug possession and his sentence of 57 months in prison and
parole of three years.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney M. Carolyn Fuentes, urging the court to
overturn Bond's conviction, said the Border Patrol agent had no
justification for squeezing the bag. Bond had a ``reasonable
expectation'' that his bag would not be handled by other people,
including passengers or law enforcement, when he put it in the
overhead compartment, added Fuentes, an assistant federal public
defender in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The justices are expected to render their decisions by July.

CANADIANS OFFER CASH TO LURE US BIOTECH EXPERTISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Seeking to lure American research business, the
Canadian province of Ontario is announcing $270 million in
incentives to U.S. biotechnology companies that perform medical
research at Ontario universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ultimate goal is to develop the Kendall Square North and
I'd love for a significant part of that to be owned by
Massachusetts companies,'' Calvin Stiller, chairman of the Ontario
Research and Development Challenge Fund, said Tuesday. Kendall
Square is a section of Cambridge, adjacent to Boston, which is a
hotbed of biotechnology research and development.
</P>
<P>
   The fund is also looking at six other U.S. cities, but sees its
biggest recruiting effort in the Boston-Cambridge area, a short
flight from Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The Ontario research funding, requiring matching dollars from
participating U.S. companies, is a first step by Canada to develop
a strong biotechnology industrial base.
</P>
<P>
   By attracting medical research from the Bay State, Ontario hopes
these companies will go the next step and expand their operations
near the University of Toronto and other Ontario universities, just
as the biotech community did in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Stiller points to Amgen Corp. of Thousand Oaks, Calif., the
world's largest biotechnology company, which late last year began
building an eight-story research facility in Kendall Square. The
site is just a few blocks from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology where Amgen has funded several research programs for
more than three years.
</P>
<P>
   Ontario's goal is to invest as much as $35 million in
Boston-area companies this year, Stiller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can't do that amount, then I have not done my job or I
don't have a case,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Ontario's faces several big risks, however. One is the potential
loss of top-notch university scientists who might emigrate to the
U.S. after working on American-sponsored research _ an acceleration
of Canada's ``brain drain.''
</P>
<P>
   Stiller said the Challenge Fund wants to invest in new
``platform'' technologies, rather than product specific research.
He acknowledged there will always be a ``tension'' between
universities and private industry over these issues.
</P>
<P>
   American biotech companies, for their part, will have to
consider whether the quality and scope of the research projects are
worth doing in Ontario or at a U.S. university, where the overall
costs will be higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada has not been on the radar screen of many U.S. biotech
companies and that's what we want to change,'' added Stiller.
``Look, we are pretty dull people but we speak the same language,
have an excellent university research focused on health care and
you can not ignore us.''
</P>
<P>
   At least two Cambridge biotech companies, Genzyme Corp. and
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc., said they would consider the Ontario
offer.
</P>
<P>
   But the details of the company-sponsored research program are
critical, said Richard Douglas, senior vice president of corporate
development at Genzyme.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have ongoing research collaborations around the world and,
while we have nothing in Canada now, we might be interested,'' said
Josh Boger, chairman and founder of Vertex Pharmaceuticals.

   TV-OLD-VALUES (Undated) _ Despite its high-tech set and clanging
music, ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire'' offers the veneer of a
return to comfy old values, to the days when quiz shows were king
and people pulled together to cheer on their champions. Even its
immense success is a throwback, uniting the country in a way that
is nearly impossible in this age of 500 channels and fragmented
audiences. Fox's ``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'' was
typical of the network in putting the sleaziest possible spin on a
trend, as it reveled in the caveman ethos of the marriage contest.
But both the benign quiz show resurgence that ABC's ``Millionaire''
has led (several clones and counting) and the blatant sexism of the
Fox show are symptoms of a deeper retro impulse. By Caryn James. &QL;

   BRUCE-WILLIS-FILMS (Undated) _ If Bruce Willis feels
``unappreciated,'' to quote his character from ``Die Hard,'' it's
easy to understand why. ``The Sixth Sense,'' the twist of an
otherworld thriller, was one of the biggest hits of 1999. The movie
has earned six Oscar nominations, including deserved acknowledgment
of young Haley Joel Osment and Toni Colette, as the mama lion whose
belief in her tormented son is steadfast. Yet Willis' considerable
effort in that film went unnoticed by the Academy. By now, he may
feel that the most memorable line from ``The Sixth Sense'' _ ``I
see dead people'' _ refers to the way Oscar voters feel about him.

recruits in Stetsons and bandoliers who take on a band of

has been sent to impregnate an Earth woman and bring back the child
as part of a plot to take over the universe _ he has been shorn of
the outward appurtenances of manhood and reduced to wearing a
Freudian clip-on. This mechanical apparatus produces hydraulic
whining noises during lovemaking, though most of the whining in the
picture still comes from Shandling. It is all about him, after all.
The film, directed by Mike Nichols, also stars Annette Bening and

<P>
   BOYD-GAINES-THEATER (New York) _ Boyd Gaines emerged from his
dressing room after a matinee of ``Contact,'' famished and drained.
He apologized for the time he had taken in collecting himself. It
is fortunate that Gaines did not make a persuasive enough case
against himself, for his moving performance as Michael Wiley, the
highly successful if suicidally lonely New Yorker of the show's
title piece, is one of the most emotionally rewarding facets of
``Contact.'' That his face is familiar to regular theatergoers _ he
won Tony Awards in 1989 and 1994 for ``The Heidi Chronicles'' and
``She Loves Me'' _ deepens the audience's own contact with the
production. The play being so popular has moved to the Vivian

<P>
   DEBORAH-YATES-THEATER (New York) _ From the moment she enters in
that arresting yellow dress, it is clear that what is happening is
not just another striking theatrical performance. It is the
uncommon but unmistakable emergence of a star. In the new Lincoln
Center dance-play, ``Contact,'' reopening at the Vivian Beaumont
Theater after a sold-out run at the Mitzi E. Newhouse, Deborah
Yates dares you to take your eyes off her. And not just because she
can fly through the air without an upswept blonde strand slipping
out of place or because she makes complex swing combinations look
as easy as the box step. It is because Yates commands the stage
with an authority that never seems arrogant, combining a playful
grit with an elegant grace that makes you want to know more about
her. By Robyn Pogrebin. &QL;

   PORGY-AND-BESS (Undated) _ ``Porgy And Bess'' comes to the New
York City Opera this week, so it is a good time to celebrate the
man largely responsible for the opera's resilience: DuBose Heyward,
the author of the 1925 novel ``Porgy.'' Of course there are those
fabulous Gershwin tunes, but no other Gershwin show has proved
revivable, and in no other Gershwin show do the songs embody
dramatic characters, even when sung out of context or played
without the lyrics. By David Schiff. &QL;

   FLEA-THEATER (New York) _ Until recently, the 80-seat Flea in
Manhattan has been thought of mainly as an Off Off Broadway
theater. Its productions have included Mac Wellman's ``Infrared,''
``Chere Maitre,'' starring Irene Worth, Rudy Stern's Theater of
Light and ``Benten Kozo,'' a Kabuki play, which won an Obie. Now it
is becoming known downtown as a dance venue hoping to give some
competition to more established spaces like P.S. 122, Dixon Place,
the Joyce SoHo and the Kitchen. This month the Flea is presenting
``Get Up! Two,'' a free festival of short dances by more than 15
choreographers that will run Tuesday nights at 8:30 through March
21. By Kevin Giordano. &QL;

   AMERICAN-SHOWS (London) _ When it comes to theatrical invasions,
there is a new one here worth signaling: the influx of American
shows, several of them in their original productions. Think of it
as a long-overdue attempt to redress what some might call a
theatrical imbalance, because the traffic, of course, generally
heads the other way. On Broadway, some kind of history was made
last spring when eight English or Irish stagings _ including those
of several American plays, ``The Iceman Cometh'' for starters _ all
opened within 10 weeks. By Matt Wolf. &QL;

   DALLAS-SYMPHONY (Undated) _ Tell a New Yorker that the symphony
orchestra in Dallas, Texas, is 100 years old, and the reaction will
probably be surprise. The Dallas Symphony Orchestra would like to
change that. True, being 100 years old in Dallas is a little
different from being 100 years old in, say, Philadelphia (where the
orchestra is celebrating its centennial this year, as well). The
DSO's history has followed a rollercoaster track of highs and lows.

   SCIARRINO-MUSIC (New York) _ ``Recitativo Oscuro,'' the title of
the concerto by Salvatore Sciarrino that Maurizio Pollini will play
this week at Carnegie Hall, with Pierre Boulez and the London
Symphony, is consistent with others in this composer's recent
output, where ideas of night and darkness often lurk. But the
embodiment of such ideas here is far more incisive, more vehement
and, indeed, louder than has been usual for Sciarrino. By Paul
Griffiths. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   LONDON-SYMPHONY (Undated) _ Pierre Boulez's four concerts with
the London Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie Hall in Manhattan
beginning Friday are, in their way, the closing of a book. The
title of this book might be ``An Age of Exploration,'' and we have
been turning its pages for about 100 years. There will be new
pieces by Salvatore Sciarrino, Peter Eotvos, Olga Neuwirth and
George Benjamin, but none will offer groundbreaking methodology or
send music into some unexplored orbit. They will make sounds,
maneuver in time and hope that we like what we hear. By Bernard
Holland. &QL;

   SHOSTAKOVICH-MUSIC (New York) _ The full houses and rapturous
critical response that greeted the Emerson String Quartet's recent
Shostakovich cycle at Alice Tully Hall gave further evidence that
Shostakovich, a giant of 20th-century music, may yet be accorded,
in the 21st, the recognition long withheld out of irrelevant
geopolitical and musico-political concerns. Now the Emerson's
wonderful performances of all 15 quartets are available in a
Deutsche Grammophon recording. By Richard Taruskin. &QL;

   SHANGHAI-SYMPHONY (Shanghai, China) _ Last year the Shanghai
Symphony Orchestra, as it has been called since 1953, celebrated
its 120th anniversary. As the nation's oldest symphony orchestra,
it has done more to promote the development of symphonic music in
China than any other institution. Its claim to the title ``best
orchestra in the Far East,'' bestowed in the 1930s, is long past.
But if judged on the basis of perseverance and dedication in the
face of seemingly insurmountable odds, the Shanghai Symphony stands
alone. By Sheila Melvin and Jindong Cai. &QL;

   CARNAVAL-BRAZIL (Salvador, Brazil) _ Carnaval in Salvador, the
state capital of Bahia, is purely a street carnaval, different from
the Folies Bergeres-like televised festivities that take place in
Rio de Janeiro. The music played on top of the trio eletrico _ it's
usually the popular new Brazilian samba-reggae or axe music _ has a
direct relationship to the street and takes part in a kind of
natural selection: each year carnaval starts with dozens of songs
written specifically for the festivities, and by the end of the
week that repertory has been narrowed to a handful. The trio
eletrico is the medium, and the street decides. By Ben Ratliff. &QL;

   DYLAN-MUSIC (Undated) _ When Bob Dylan was an acerbic young folk
singer warning that the times were a-changin', one change he
probably did not envision was that he would become a darling of the
high-art world. Yet last fall, nearly 40 years after he made his
first records, Dylan was declared one of the greatest artists of
the 20th century by Andrew Motion, the British poet laureate. And
now the composer John Corigliano, commissioned to write a song
cycle for the soprano Sylvia McNair's Carnegie Hall recital on
March 15, has produced ``Mr. Tambourine Man: Seven Songs of Bob
Dylan,'' a 35-minute song cycle. By Allan Kozinn. &QL;

   CHARLES-ATLAS-ART (New York) _ In the last 30 years, Charles
Atlas has created scores of videos, films, performances and set and
lighting designs for opera, theater and dance. This Friday through
April 1 he returns to the Kitchen, in Manhattan, where he first
performed a short dance in a 1974 series that also featured the
artists Joan Jonas and Hannah Wilke. His current appearance is as a
video-installation artist with two new works, ``As If You Like It''
and ``10,'' both of which will fill the walls of the Kitchen's
large second-floor gallery with digitally altered patterns of
mesmerizing movement by elaborately costumed performers. By Michael
Rush. &QL;

<P>
   TURKEY-ART (Istanbul, Turkey) _ There is bad news for anyone
planning to visit Turkey this year. The velvet-lined case that
houses the country's most famous artifact, the glittering Topkapi
dagger, will be empty. Nor will visitors be able to see the curved
battle sword that hung from Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror's hip when
his army captured Constantinople in 1453, or the inlaid
ebony-and-ivory throne from which the vast Ottoman Empire was once
ruled, or the dazzling emerald-studded turban decoration that awed
visitors to the court of Sultan Ahmed I in the 17th century. The
good news, however, is that these objects and more than 200 others,
some of which have never before left the Topkapi Palace, will be
missing because they will be on tour through the United States.
They are part of one of the most ambitious exhibitions of Ottoman
treasures ever assembled. The exhibition, called ``Palace of Gold
and Light: Treasures From the Topkapi, Istanbul,'' opened on
Wednesday at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington. By Stephen

   RENZO-PIANO-ARCH (Paris) _ Renzo Piano chuckled as he remembered
how he and Richard Rogers were ``young boys, really young and quite
bad boys'' in 1971 when they won the architecture competition for
the Georges Pompidou Center with a design that they considered a
parody of technology. Even now, at 62, Piano, a good-natured
Italian, seemed amazed that France allowed two young foreigners _
he was 33 and his British partner was 37 _ to challenge the sober
18th-century stone facades of eastern Paris with an immense
metallic structure variously described (by its critics) as a
refinery or an ocean liner and (by its architects) as ``a Jules
Verne spaceship that can't fly.'' The Pompidou Center, which opened
in 1977, proved immensely popular and today it (italics)is(end
italics) a monument. Piano in turn made his name and collected
architectural honors, including the highly regarded Pritzker Prize
in 1998. By Alan Riding. &QL;

SMOKING ADS _ PRO AND CON _ FOUND EFFECTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts' $54 million anti-smoking campaign, which
relies on stark but slick TV commercials, is effective with
teenagers, but new research shows that cigarette company ads are
equally as powerful in winning over new smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts' seven-year-old campaign to prevent teen smoking
cut in half the smoking rates of 12- to 14-year-olds who absorbed
the messages, compared to those who didn't recall the ads,
according to a study published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the first-of-its-kind research also exposed that teenagers
who can identify a cigarette brand and own a tobacco company
promotional item, such as a T-shirt or cap, are almost three times
more likely to become smokers compared to peers who don't pay
attention to manufacturers' messages.
</P>
<P>
   Boston University researcher Dr. Michael Siegel said the new
data make a strong case against Governor Paul Cellucci's recent
proposal to cut the state's $54 million antismoking campaign by $10
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect in these studies is so strong that it argues for
increasing the state's antismoking advertising campaign,'' Siegel
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said their results help explain why smoking
rates among Massachusetts 14- to 17-year-olds declined from 24.6
percent to 19.7 percent between 1993 and 1999, according to
preliminary state figures. Nationally the rates have been flat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The latest numbers show we are definitely turning the corner
on youth smoking,'' said Dr. Howard Koh, the state health
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   The newly found 50 percent reduction in smoking rates among
young teenagers exposed to antismoking ads is ``a huge effect,''
said Siegel, who did the research with Lois Biener of the
University of Massachusetts/Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Other studies have found a 10 to 20 percent decline in smoking
rates among either adults or children from various interventions,
such as classroom education, cigarette tax increases, and state
laws preventing tobacco sales to minors.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies of advertising effects have been small and done
in research settings. Attempts to guage the effect of statewide
antismoking campaigns on youth smoking have had mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   But the new research in the American Journal of Public Health
followed nearly 600 Massachusetts teenagers for four years to
assess the impact of the state's campaign. None were ``established
smokers'' at the outset, although almost 10 percent had
experimented with cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Over the four-year period, the state Department of Public Health
spent about $8 for every man, woman, and child on its antismoking
campaign, more than any other state.
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter of the teenagers became habitual smokers during the
study. But younger teens who recalled seeing antismoking messages
in the previous 30 days were only half as likely to have become
established smokers compared to peers who did not recall seeing
antismoking ads.
</P>
<P>
   There was no advertising effect among older teens _ those who
were 14 and 15 years old when the study started. ``This suggest to
us there is a critical window of opportunity to reach adolescents
and affect their smoking attitudes,'' Siegel said. ``By 14 or 15
years old, many of their attitudes toward smoking are resistant to
change.''

SUPREME COURT ARGUMENTS PUT POLICE PRACTICES UNDER SCRUTINY 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Fla., Texas) (nk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two lively Supreme Court arguments on police
practices found the government on the defensive Tuesday, as the
justices suggested that the police may have violated the
Constitution by frisking a Miami teen-ager on the basis of an
anonymous tip that he was carrying a gun and by squeezing a bus
passenger's soft-sided luggage to see if it contained drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The court appeared surprisingly unimpressed by the government's
arguments, in one case that guns are so inherently dangerous that
the police are justified in acting on the basis of a bare-bones tip
that might otherwise be insufficient, and in the other case that
passengers relinquish any expectation of privacy in their luggage
once they toss it into an overhead bin where it can be pushed and
shoved by others seeking room for their own bags.
</P>
<P>
   The two cases were unconnected except that both require the
court to interpret the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against
unreasonable searches. Despite hundreds of Fourth Amendment
decisions over the years, this area of the law continues to pose
novel questions, and the justices retain a keen interest in it.
Within the last week, the Supreme Court has accepted two additional
search cases for argument next fall.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The scrutiny comes during a larger debate over police practices
generated by the acquittal of four New York City officers in the
shooting of an unarmed immigrant, Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The luggage case heard Tuesday was an appeal by a man who was
convicted of carrying more than a pound of methamphetamine, which a
federal agent discovered by squeezing and manipulating luggage
stowed in overhead bins on a Greyhound bus stopped at an
immigration checkpoint in Texas. Two lower federal courts rejected
Steven D. Bond's argument that the agent's actions amounted to an
unconstitutional search.
</P>
<P>
   The government is arguing in Bond vs. United States, No.
98-9349, that there was no search within the meaning of the Fourth
Amendment, because Bond had no ``reasonable expectation of
privacy'' in luggage he had placed where anyone could touch it.
``The principle that governs this case is `knowing exposure,'''
Jeffrey A. Lamken, an assistant solicitor general, told the
justices. He said the central question was whether ``this was
something any member of the traveling public could have felt while
handling, pushing, grabbing the bag.''
</P>
<P>
   The justices at first appeared inclined to agree that this was
the way to view the case, but they grew openly more skeptical as
the argument proceeded.
</P>
<P>
   While Justice Stephen G. Breyer agreed that he himself often
moved other people's bags around in overhead airplane bins ``to
push mine in,'' several of his colleagues countered that there was
a difference between pushing and feeling, and that a passenger who
expected a bag to be shoved aside did not necessarily expect it to
be deliberately poked and probed.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least in my experience, people don't take it out and feel
it,'' Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said.
</P>
<P>
   And Justice Anthony M. Kennedy observed: ``It does seem to me
that another passenger does not have the right to start squeezing
my luggage to see what's in it.'' He added: ``There's some level of
wrong occurring there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamken invoked a line of Supreme Court precedents under which
the police may peer through open windows or look down from
surveillance planes at open fields. Justice David H. Souter
objected. ``You assume that touching and looking, for Fourth
Amendment purposes, are identical, and I don't see that identity at
all,'' Souter said, adding: ``People can stare at you on the
street, but if they start patting down your pockets, you'll think a
different value is involved.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Justice Antonin Scalia insisted that it was
unreasonable to assume any privacy in luggage stowed in a public
place. Just because it was ``nasty'' and ``impolite'' to squeeze
someone's luggage did not mean people should assume it would not
happen, he told M. Carolyn Fuentes, as assistant federal public
defender from San Antonio who was representing Bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are laws against peeping toms, and but there are still
peeping toms, and when you leave your blinds open you can expect
someone to look in,'' Scalia said. He added that there was ``an
easy way'' to protect luggage against unwanted squeezing: ``It's
called hard luggage.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuentes told the justices that a decision that did not treat the
agent's action as a search would ``isolate an entire range of
police behavior from Fourth Amendment constraints.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The other case Tuesday, on whether an anonymous tip was
sufficient to justify the police in frisking a 15-year-old who was
standing on a Miami street corner, asked the court to decide, for
the first time, whether the greater the danger suggested by an
anonymous allegation, the less objective evidence the police need
before acting on it.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Florida vs. J.L., No. 98-1993, the anonymous
caller said that three men were standing at a particular bus stop
and that the one in the plaid shirt was carrying a concealed gun. A
police officer, arriving six minutes later, saw the butt of a gun
sticking out of the pocket of the teenager in a plaid shirt as the
officer began to frisk him. Florida law permits carrying a
concealed weapon, but only for those at least 21 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, identified only by his initials, was charged in
juvenile court, which suppressed the evidence on the ground that
the tip did not provide the police officer with an adequate basis
for the pat-down search. The Florida Supreme Court agreed, ruling
in 1998 that a tip of unknown reliability that describes only
innocent behavior is not sufficiently reliable to provide the
necessary reasonable suspicion. ``We decline the state's invitation
to create a firearm or weapons exception to the limitations on
searches and seizures,'' the state court said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Neimand, an assistant state attorney general arguing
Florida's appeal, conceded that if the tip had reported that
someone was hiding a marijuana cigarette instead of a gun, the
police could not have intervened. But because the allegation
involved a gun, he said, concerns for the officer's safety
justified the frisk.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor objected that this argument was
circular; the officer's safety was potentially at risk only because
the police responded to the tip by going to the scene, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's he supposed to do?'' Neimand replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``One would have thought nothing,'' O'Connor said, unless the
court was willing to extend its precedents concerning anonymous
tips.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration entered the case in support of
Florida. Irving L. Gornstein, an assistant solicitor general, told
the justices that ``a reasonable and prudent person'' would act on
the basis of fewer verifiable details when a tip suggested great
public danger.
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy appeared to reflect the court's reluctance to adopt
a new rule in this area when he told Gornstein: ``We fear tips
because of pranks and people who have vendettas. The assumption is
they're generally unreliable.''
</P>
<P>
   However, several justices pressed the defendant's lawyer, Harvey
J. Sepler, to explain why an exception should not be made for a tip
that ``someone has thousands of pounds of bomb material in a bag
outside a courthouse or a school,'' as Breyer expressed it.
</P>
<P>
   Sepler, an assistant public defender from Miami, said that ``in
an extreme public emergency, reasonable suspicion might bend.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that to permit the police to act on the ``bald
allegation'' that someone has a gun ``is to allow the police to
search anyone, any time.'' There has to be ``meaningful
corroboration,'' he said, adding: ``This is a very fundamental case
that goes to the heart of the relationship between the police and
citizens in a free society.''

HOWARD STERN ON KATHIE LEE AND HIS NEW TV SHOW, `SON OF THE BEACH'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a press conference for the upcoming cable series ``Son of the
Beach,'' Howard Stern, who puts on a suit and assumes executive
responsibilities for the show as its executive producer, did what
he does best _ promote himself _ but he also took time out for a
little batting practice on his favorite target, Kathie Lee Gifford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Son of the Beach'' stars Tim Stack, star and creator of the
underappreciated ``Nightstand With Dick Dietrich,'' a parody of
talk-show flotsam and jetsam, as Notch Johnson, the flaccid but
heroic lifeguard of a Malibu-adjacent beach. Think ``Baywatch,''
only the laughs are intentional, though Stern likened it to ``'Get
Smart' meets `The Beach.' It points out the ridiculousness of beach
shows. And Tim is hotter than David Hasselhoff.''
</P>
<P>
   It also offers plenty of anatomically ample women and puns about
genitalia and mammillae. ``It's not politically correct,'' allowed
Stern, stating the obvious. ``We don't even care if women don't
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern won't appear in the series, which will debut on March 14
on the FX cable channel. ``Like you, I've never heard of FX
either,'' Stern deadpanned. ``I thought I was doing this show for
Fox.''
</P>
<P>
   The shock jock said the production process for the series was
``remarkably smooth, unlike my radio career. We had to check out
that the butt-cheek-to-fabric ratio (in the bathing suits) was
acceptable _ that was the kind of meetings I've been dealing with.
This is more exciting for me as opposed to radio, where there's
constant fighting, constant screaming and shouting. This is a new
role for me: responsible businessman.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern insisted he was a hands-on executive, ensuring the series
keeps its wit about it. ``My name will bring audiences to exactly
one episode _ the first. If it's not funny, they won't come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in Stern's pipeline is an animated series for UPN titled
``Pipeline,'' and he's currently mulling over the future of his
radio career _ his contract expires in a couple of months. ``I'm
going to figure out if I want to go on in radio; I don't know if I
do,'' he said. Stern also reacted to Kathie Lee Gifford's
announcement that she was leaving the morning jabberfest ``Live
With Regis &AMP; Kathie Lee.'' ``It sounds like a contract ploy to
me,'' Stern said. ``If she's out of work, we should all celebrate.
That show is so irrelevant _ it's everything that's wrong with
television. Kathie Lee looks like a train hit her at this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``She announced that she is leaving `Regis &AMP; Kathie Lee' because
of her children; she wanted to keep them out of the limelight,''
Stern continued, adding, ``The only person putting them in the
limelight is Kathie Lee. She needs to take them off the magazine
covers, take them out of her holiday specials. If it wasn't for
her, none of us would ever see or care about Kathie Lee's kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's just coincidence, but an evil, effeminate character
in ``Son of the Beach'' shares a name with Gifford's most
celebrated progeny: Cody. &QL;

NOTHING SIMPLE ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S PRIMARY
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MCCAIN-NYT) 
(nk) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Picture this: Sen. John McCain wins more total
votes than Gov. George W. Bush in the California primary next
Tuesday, as some polls here suggest is possible. California's
secretary of state, Bill Jones, a Republican who also happens to be
McCain's most prominent California supporter, would certify him,
under state law, as the Republican winner of the state's blanket
primary, in which the names of all candidates appear on the same
ballot regardless of party.
</P>
<P>
   Simple? Not.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 32b9 of the Republican National Committee prohibits the
party from recognizing the results of so-called jungle primaries,
in which voters of any party may vote for candidates of any other
by skittering down the very same ballot. So, state and national
party officials insist, all of California's 162 Republican
delegates will go to the candidate who receives the most Republican
votes, as determined by a second, computer-coded count of
party-members only.
</P>
<P>
   And so far, Bush has maintained about a 2-to-1 lead among
Republicans in the polls, while he and McCain are within a few
points of each other overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the loser goes the spoils,'' said Tony Quinn, a Republican
political strategist and expert on redistricting in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   That anomaly could conceivably produce the first real fight over
credentials at a Republican National Convention since the contest
between Dwight D. Eisenhower and Robert A. Taft in 1952, before
primaries became the main means of choosing nominees.
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds complicated, it is.
</P>
<P>
   Courts have consistently given the parties wide leeway in
setting their own rules and choosing delegates. The McCain camp's
only recourse would be for a registered California Republican who
could otherwise have been a delegate to file a challenge with the
party's nine-member contest committee, which would make a
recommendation to the full Republican National Committee. The
leadership's ruling could in turn be appealed to the credentials
committee, and could ultimately wind up as the first order of
business on the floor of the convention in Philadelphia this
summer. In that decision, California's disputed delegation could
not vote.
</P>
<P>
   But the party leadership is controlled by officials sympathetic
to Bush. Moreover, Bush, McCain and Alan Keyes have all filed
notarized affidavits with the California Republican Party agreeing
to abide by the results of the Republican-only count and to forgo
undertaking or supporting any challenges, so McCain would face an
uphill fight.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some Republicans here say there are arguments to be made.
In states like Michigan and South Carolina, any registered voter
may request a partisan ballot to vote in a primary. In others, like
New Hampshire, Republicans and independents may vote in a
Republican primary, but not Democrats. These are known as ``open
primaries,'' and while the party establishment may not like them,
it has accepted them in an effort to draw crossover voters who may
stick with Republicans in November.
</P>
<P>
   But in California, Washington and Alaska, western states without
strong partisan traditions, the names of all candidates are listed
on the primary ballot, allowing voters to mix and match, without
even a one-day pretense of party affiliation. Neither major
national party tolerates such heresy, and the Republicans adopted
their rule in 1988, shortly after Washington state adopted its
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a difference without a distinction,'' said Quinn.
``What it says is you can accept somebody who walks in in a state
like Virginia, and says `Give me the Republican ballot,' but you
won't accept our blanket system here.''
</P>
<P>
   California's system was passed in 1996 ballot measure,
Proposition 198. Its chief sponsor was Tom Campbell, then a
Republican state senator and now a congressman from Northern
California, who had lost a primary for U.S. Senate to a more
conservative candidate in 1992 and believed he might have won with
crossover voters. But from the beginning, the major political
parties here have opposed the measure as an unconstitutional
meddling with their right of free association. Federal courts have
upheld the law and the parties' challenge is to be heard before the
U.S. Supreme Court in April.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the parties sought to ``re-close'' the
presidential primary, first with a 1998 ballot measure that failed
at the polls, and then with a bipartisan bill signed last year by
Gov. Gray Davis specifying the two counts, one of the overall vote
and one of the partisan vote.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, a former Democratic state senator, Barry Keene,
filed a challenge asking the California Supreme Court to overturn
the dual-count law, on the grounds that under the California
Constitution, a ballot initiative may only be amended by another
initiative, not legislation. He asked the court to block the public
release of any partisan count next week, pending a hearing on the
merits.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Jones, the secretary of state, has argued that the
parties should change their rules to accept the blanket system.

AFGHAN HEROIN FEEDS ADDICTION IN REGION, U.N. REPORT DECLARES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The U.N. Drug Control Program says in a report
made public Tuesday that Afghanistan now not only is the largest
producer of opium but also is becoming a major manufacturer of
heroin, which is contributing to a rise in addiction throughout the
region.
</P>
<P>
   The report, prepared for a meeting here of Afghanistan's six
neighbors on Monday, plus the United States and Russia, says that
Pakistan and Iran now have some of the world's highest rates of
addiction to heroin, which is derived from opium. ``Central Asian
countries show alarming signs of fast-increasing abuse rates,'' it
says.
</P>
<P>
   Afghanistan is encircled by Pakistan, Iran, Turkmenistan,
Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and a far-western corridor of China.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of heroin addicts in the region exceeds that of
Western Europe and is still on the increase,'' says the report,
prepared by Pino Arlacchi, executive director of the U.N. Office
for Drug Control and Crime Prevention. The report adds that
communities of addicts in the region are seen as easy targets for
organized crime and vectors for the spread of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The report says that there is no evidence to support charges
that drug profits are going either to leaders of the Taliban, who
control most of Afghanistan, or to the Northern Alliance, the
remains of the former government. Both forces impose taxes on
traders, however, with the Taliban earning $10 million to $30
million a year, according to varying estimates, the report says. It
says no estimates are available of the alliance's earnings from
this source.
</P>
<P>
   As a country, the report says, Afghanistan receives only about 1
percent of the global profits of the opium and heroin originating
there. Poor farmers with no other easy way to earn an income do
most of the cultivation, turning over crops to local traders.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. report links the increase in narcotics production in
Afghanistan with the economic, political and social collapse caused
by decades of civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like viruses thrive best in frail bodies,'' it says, ``illicit
drugs prosper best in regions that are in internal turmoil with
weak or nonexistent government structures and controls.'' Taliban
leaders say that until they get help in building an economy, they
cannot ask farmers to forgo the only income they have.

Cooperstown, N.Y., after the Veterans Committee chose the former
manager of the Cincinnati Reds and Detroit Tigers as the newest
Hall of Famer.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, the only manager to win World Series in both leagues,
will join Tony Perez, one of his former players with the Big Red
Machine of the 1970s, when the induction ceremonies are held on
July 23. On that day, Anderson, who will wear a Reds' cap on his
plaque, will finally walk into the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to go into the most precious place in baseball
unless I belonged there,'' Anderson said. ``If I got elected, I'll
go in and spend hours looking at everything. Then I'll know I'm in
a place that's a dream house.''
</P>
<P>
   There was controversy during Tuesday's meeting as the committee
members were told not to vote for Dick Williams, the former manager
who won the 1972 and 1973 World Series with the Oakland A's. He was
a runner-up in the voting last year. But Williams pleaded no
contest to charges of indecent exposure last January and the Hall
of Fame wanted to put some distance between the incident before
making Williams eligible again.
</P>
<P>
   At least one committee member challenged the directive and said
that the members should be able to make their own decisions on
Williams, but the ruling stood. Joe Brown, the chairman of the
committee, did not mention Williams as one of the men who received
votes in the category for former managers, executives, umpires and
Negro Leaguers. One person familiar with the committee's previous
thinking said Williams, a special adviser to the Yankees who was
instructed not to come to spring training, would probably have been
inducted if he had not been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to me down in Fort Myers when I was arrested
evidently hurt me quite a bit,'' Williams said in a telephone
interview. ``What came out on that in the papers was not true. I
was not masturbating on the balcony. I'm going to issue a statement
about it so the explanation goes across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   While Williams was not specific about what he was doing, he
called the incident embarrassing. Williams tried to tread carefully
about the apparent slight because the members will be considering
him next year, but he admitted that it seemed unfair that members
were forbidden from voting for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything about that,'' Williams said. ``I don't
want to say anything against the committee. But that doesn't seem
fair. Sparky was going to get in anyway. That just complicated my
chances.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Anderson, Turkey Stearnes, a Negro Leagues
outfielder with a .352 career average, and Bid McPhee, a second
baseman who played for the Reds in the 1880s and 1890s, were also
inducted. Bill Mazeroski, Gil Hodges, Dom DiMaggio and Tony Oliva
were among the players who were strongly considered for induction
in the former major leaguer category, but none of them received
enough votes.
</P>
<P>
   It took a 75 percent vote from the 14-man committee, or 11
votes, to be inducted and Mazeroski, the former second baseman for
the Pittsburgh Pirates, received 10 votes. Hodges, the stoic
manager of the Mets and the former first baseman for the Brooklyn
Dodgers, fell three or four votes shy. Normally, the committee has
15 members, but Buck O'Neill was unable to attend because of an
arthritic condition. The committee votes in four different
categories.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson managed the Reds from 1970-78, winning two World Series
titles, and managed the Tigers from 1979-1995, winning another
championship. He had a 2,194-1,834 managerial record, trailing only
Connie Mack (3,731) and John McGraw (2,784) for the most victories
in major league history.
</P>
<P>
   As the 16th manager to be elected to the Hall of Fame, Anderson
had two successful and disparate parts of his career. He was the
brains behind the Big Red Machine of Johnny Bench, Joe Morgan, Pete
Rose and Tony Perez, winning the title with the Reds in 1975 and
1976. Then Anderson went to the Tigers and won another title in
1984, guiding the likes of Kirk Gibson, Alan Trammell, Lou Whitaker
and Willie Hernandez. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Anderson walks through the doors in Cooperstown for the
first time, Perez and Marty Brennaman, a Reds broadcaster, will be
inducted as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never worn a World Series ring, and I'll wear this ring
until I die,'' Anderson said. ``That, to me, is how much of a
difference there is between the World Series and the Hall of
Fame.''

 &HT;    Companies pitch ideas hoping investors will catch at Red Herring
market
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the search for the Next New Thing, this was _ at
least for the moment _ the place for seekers to be.
</P>
<P>
   Red Herring's Venture Market South, which wraps up today at the
Ritz-Carlton, has been a high-octane mix of entrepreneurs from
around the Southeast and a crowd of folks with money to invest.
</P>
<P>
   It is the kind of money that only the Internet economy can
entice _ or create.
</P>
<P>
   John Mecklenburg, Red Herring editor of events, talked of the
Internet's spectacular growth, arguing that even a conservative
projection will make the Net a $1.5 trillion industry within three
years, eclipsing industries like telecommunications and airlines.
</P>
<P>
   He told of casually giving his card to a cab driver on a trip to
a remote part of Egypt, then months later receiving an e-mail from
the man asking whether he should take his savings and buy stock in
Yahoo. ``It means that there is almost no place on the Earth that
you can go anymore where people aren't participating in the
Internet economy, period.''
</P>
<P>
   Mecklenburg promised investors Tuesday that their presence would
be rewarded. ``Half of the 44 companies here were formed in 1999,''
he said. ``They are young and very hungry _ and they are here to
cut deals.''
</P>
<P>
   In trade for some money, the entrepreneurs would part with some
control.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as, one by one, the chief executives began stepping into the
spotlight, they revealed as much confidence as hunger. Their
markets are measured in billions of dollars, their approach is
distinctive, their management stellar, or so they told the
prospective investors.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Galileo Development wants to raise $5 million for
its Web-based software solutions business, said CEO Rebecca W.
Bass. ``We see a $50 billion potential market by 2004.''
</P>
<P>
   Each entrepreneur took the few minutes allotted to explain why
his or her idea, technology or business is a platinum-plated chance
to invest onto a rocket before it leaves the pad.
</P>
<P>
   But then, tickets are apparently not that hard to hawk.
</P>
<P>
   The start-ups at this conference have been culled from hundreds
of companies. And listening to their stories is an audience of
hundreds of venture capitalists who represent investors across the
country _ and hundreds of millions of dollars that they are
scrambling for ways to invest.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Ryan, chief executive and co-founder of Inanta, said his
company, which has a technology for delivering high-speed audio and
video, last year received about $2.5 million in ``seed money'' from
a Toronto fund to get started. Now he's looking for 10 times that.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, he's feeling picky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll have no problem finding the money,'' Ryan said.
``The issue is finding the right money.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta money is particularly interested in companies using the
Net to sell from one business to another _ the ``B-2-B'' play.
Incanta has technology that will be sold to Internet Service
Providers, but the fact that it is delivered to consumers tarnished
its luster, Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Atlanta, it's a very tough sell,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Incanta is giving part of itself to charity. The company on
Friday will announce a donation of 2 percent equity interest to the
Atlanta-based Boys and Girls Clubs, Ryan said. ``You have to have a
shared vision. You have to have a belief set.''
</P>
<P>
   At the edge of the tech boom are other companies that hope to
serve the surge of start-ups. For instance, new companies can look
to incubators like eHatchery or the Advanced Technology Development
Center at Georgia Tech as places to percolate and grow.
</P>
<P>
   And there are new entries there, too.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Hall Green, president of Green Machine, says his company
has plans to rent space in a building near Georgia Tech that would
house nascent tech firms. The company hopes to offer everything
from marketing to ad agency assistance, and may even invest its own
money at times, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having cool space with a start-up is important. We will have
the coolest space in town.''
</P>
<P>
   In the room where the investors could meet the entrepreneurs, a
tide of people surged between rows of booths. People picked up a
flier, stared intently at a demo, listened to an entrepreneurial
pitch before shifting to the next display. They jostled each other
as if milling in a bustling station, watching signs for a host of
trains departing and wondering whether to board.
</P>
<P>
   In the air hung the scent of possibility. Or perhaps just the
ghosts of IPOs past.
</P>
<P>
   Keynote speaker Robert Young was introduced as the chairman and
co-founder of Red Hat Inc., a company that sells Linux-based
software and has reported revenues totaling less than $13 million,
but has shares worth $9.3 billion. And that is after the stock lost
more than 50 percent of its value in the recent market decline.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Atlanta-based companies also have swiftly passed
from start-up to publicly traded welterweights, including Internet
Security Systems, Healtheon/WebMD and EarthLink.
</P>
<P>
   But Young, wearing red tie, red socks and eventually donning his
signature red baseball cap, alternately doused the hype and played
to it. ``What are the statistics? Four out of five businesses go
bust in the first year and most of the rest go bust in the second
year.''
</P>
<P>
   He warned against fanatical adherence to business plans or
religious devotion to technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value of our product was not the bits and bytes, the value
was in the licensing model. We treated our customers as partners
not servants.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those hoping to follow Young's example _ or at least Red
Hat's success _ were a slew of CEOs with resumes studded with
corporate brand names.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan and the other Incanta founders came from Nortel Networks.
CEO Eric Grossman was a senior manager at Ernst &AMP; Young before
becoming CEO of SimplyHealth.com. Mike Bruce of Virginia-based
SingleShop.com started working for Bellcore as a software developer
_ when he was in the seventh grade.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Buttermore was MediaOne's top engineer in Atlanta before
leaving late last year to start PurePacket Communications, which
will offer high-speed Internet access through a variety of methods.
</P>
<P>
   Having the right people is key, said Chris Kidd, managing
director of the executive search firm, Korn/Ferry International.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any of us in this business can raise $50 million with five
phone calls, if you have the right management team,'' he said
Monday. ``Culture, structure and process will all follow if you
choose your people carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   But Herring hopefuls arrived with varying angles ranging from
those with a consumer service to business-to-business. There were
some with technology behind the curtain that consumers will never
see, even as they use the service. Others offer Web-based ways to
pool information that consumers will want _ along with various
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Digital Benefits of Atlanta, for example, offers to connect
insurers, administrators, employers, employees, consumers and
others who need access to information about insurance. The company
has $250,000 get-started money from its management and is seeking
$6 million more.
</P>
<P>
   By eliminating paper, Digital Benefits stands to win big, said
CEO John Nail. ``Bottom line, there are hundreds of billions of
dollars of waste.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar kind of waste permeates the legal profession, where
potential customers should be able and anxious to save time and
costs, said Samuel B. Kellett Jr., chief executive of Atlanta-based
eAttorney.com. ``It is a huge, affluent demographic. There is $73
billion lost to inefficiencies. With our technology, lawyers could
do their work in half the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerging Net technologies also permit increasingly customized
responses to users _ and some of the start-ups would like to
capitalize on them.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Chutney has already raised $2 million for its
software aimed at letting Web sites personalize the responses given
to surfers, said CEO Aninya Datta, a professor at Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia-based iClique.com has technology to tailor Web sites _
like those of matchmakers _ to the cultural bent of the user, said
CEO Barry E.A. Johnson, former president of MSBET, the Microsoft
venture with Black Entertainment Television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seniors don't date the way teen-agers do, and Latino men don't
date the way white men do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   IClique, which hopes to raise up to $7 million, believes its
answers are unique. What it shares with so many other start-ups is
the notion that cyberspace is the place for romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's looking for love,'' Johnson said. ``And especially
on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   And then you ask, how badly does someone want love?
</P>
<P>
   Some Red Herring entrepreneurs will have a shot at locking up $1
million in financing before the conference even closes. PTEK
Ventures, the investment arm of PTEK Holdings, late this afternoon
will pick four presenting companies and let them compete for a
portion _ or all _ of $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a Regis Philbin lookalike, four hungry
entrepreneurs, and a public quiz in the style of television's ``Who
Wants to Be A Millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Steelman, founder and CEO of Atlanta-based Chatfish, said he
is looking for $4 million to fund the company, which has developed
interactive Web technology. He is not sure he wants to take up
PTEK's Millionaire Challenge, figuring that like any other funding,
it would no doubt come with strings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cute. It's a good gimmick. But it's not free money.''

FREED REPORTER'S CLAIMS OF TORTURE RAISE CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A senior Russia commander, saying the last major rebel
stronghold in Chechnya had been captured, Tuesday declared that the
full-scale offensive against separatist militants in the republic
had come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   But a first-hand account by a freed Radio Liberty reporter of
the abusive treatment of inmates in a detention camp in Chechnya
raised new questions about what fate awaits the populace as Moscow
tightens its grip on the breakaway region.
</P>
<P>
   Colonel General Gennady Troshev, the deputy commander of
Russia's 100,000 troops in Chechnya, said the fall of the mountain
town of Shatoi meant that ``the bandit formations have been
defeated.'' He said troops were mopping up remaining pockets of
resistance after overrunning Shatoi, and predicted hostilities in
Chechnya would cease altogether in a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can speak of the conclusion of the military operation to
destroy large bandit groups,'' Troshev said.
</P>
<P>
   Troshev's announcement was sure to provide a boost for Acting
President Vladimir Putin, already the favorite to win a March 26
presidential vote. But the scathing account of journalist Andrei
Babitsky, who returned to Moscow Tuesday after a mysterious
six-week disappearance, took some of the sheen off Moscow's victory
declaration.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky, who was detained by Russian forces in January,
described a regimen of heavy beatings and torture at the
``filtration camp'' in Chernokozovo, in northern Chechnya, where
Russian authorities hold suspected Chechen rebels. Babitsky said he
was held there in late January before being turned over to masked
men who kept him captive in Chechnya until his release.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups and Chechen refugees have alleged that
inmates at the Chernokozovo camp are subjected to systematic
torture, rape and executions by Russian troops, charges Moscow
heatedly denies as anti-Russian propaganda. Babitsky provided a
look at conditions in the camp at a time when Moscow is stepping up
detentions of young men in areas recently occupied by federal
troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the first three days I was there the beatings continued
24 hours a day,'' Babitsky told Russian NTV television, describing
his captors as ``sadists.''
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky said in an interview with the Russian service of Radio
Liberty that he himself had undergone a ``routine initiation, which
everyone without exception goes through when they arrive there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a few dozen blows of a truncheon on the body, which go
fairly painlessly after two or three days and do not leave any
serious irreparable internal consequences,'' he said, adding he was
spared much worse treatment afforded suspected rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Torture, I cannot find another word,'' he said, describing the
ordeal of one woman who he said was beaten for several hours on
Jan. 20. ``There were cries which showed a person is experiencing
torturous, unbearable pain and experiencing it for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian investigators looking into alleged human rights
violations at Chernokozovo have repeatedly described the situation
there as ``normal.'' The camp warden told journalists Tuesday he
had heard no complaints from prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials say the military operation in Chechnya is an
effort to restore peace and order after three years of lawlessness
under the rebels, who had driven out Russian troops in 1994-1996
war.
</P>
<P>
   As Troshev handed a Russian flag to a paratrooper to raise over
the war-wrecked town of Shatoi, he promised villagers that their
troubles were over.
</P>
<P>
   Troshev, shown on NTV television, said Russian troops would have
to conduct frequent sweeps of Chechen settlements to ensure
militants did not return _ as they were able to do repeatedly in
the previous war.
</P>
<P>
   News agencies reported that most of the 2,000 rebels who had
been holed up in Shatoi had escaped into nearby villages and could
be expected to regroup. Others were believed to be trying to cross
Chechnya's mountainous southern border into the former Soviet
republic of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   In Chechnya last week, Russian soldiers said they believed that
many rebels had returned to their homes disguised as civilians,
where they could hide out and plan new guerilla attacks. Chechen
civilians in villages south of the destroyed capital, Grozny, say
all males aged 15 and older are detained by the local police. When
some of them do not come back, people assume they have been taken
to Chernokozovo.
</P>
<P>
   This week, journalists who were allowed to visit the
Chernokozovo detention center saw no signs of mistreatment, and
described freshly painted walls and hot meals. But when a group of
Chechen women tried to speak with the journalists after the tour of
the facility, the Russian organizers refused to stop the bus and
armed troops pushed the women back.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky resurfaced in the Dagestani capital Makhachkala Friday
after weeks of speculation about where he was and whether he was
even alive.
</P>
<P>
   He had been held in police custody in Dagestan on charges of
holding a false passport and was released only after Putin
intervened by saying he opposed his detention for the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky, whose scathing reports from the war zone infuriated
the Kremlin, still faces questioning on charges of aiding the
rebels, and is not allowed to leave Moscow. He promised eventually
to tell everything about his detention and release, but he did not
speak to reporters gathered on the street outside his Moscow
apartment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please, Andrei is exhausted,'' his wife Lyudmila said. ``He is
sleeping. I'm very sorry. I also haven't slept in two days myself.
Come back tomorrow.''

E-COMMERCE SOFTWARE FIRM SHARES TRIPLE ON FIRST DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares of net.Genesis Corp., an Internet marketing software firm
founded by two college students, more than tripled Tuesday in
initial trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Cambridge, Mass. company designs software that helps Web
businesses analyze information about site visitors to help convert
them into frequent buyers. This niche market continues to grow
rapidly, fueled by the number of firms flocking to the Web to sell
everything from Pokemon video games to sports utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Although many online retailers are expected to struggle in an
increasingly crowded market, the software companies that help build
better Web sites should perform well over the next several years,
industry observers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of which Web site eventually wins, the companies
providing the infrastructure are expected to survive,'' said Steve
Tuen, an analyst with the IPO Value Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   In its first day of trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market,
net.Genesis shares climbed from its opening price of 18 to close at
56 13/16. The company raised $76.5 million amid a robust market for
technology stocks Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The software firm's backers include the Waltham, Mass. venture
capital firm, Charles River Partners, which owned about 12 percent
of net.Genesis after the offering. Its 2.4 million shares were
worth about $134 million Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chief executive Larry Bohn held nearly 7 percent, worth
approximately $79 million.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has rewarded several other providers of Web consumer
analysis. Shares of Accrue Software Inc., initially priced at 10
apiece last July, closed Tuesday at 46 15/16. WebTrends Corp.,
which went public at 13 per share in February 1999, closed at 95 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Net.Genesis is among several Massachusetts companies going
public this week. Also holding IPOs this week are MatrixOne Inc., a
Chelmsford software firm, and Switchboard Inc., a Westborough firm
that provides a huge directory of individuals and businesses
online.
</P>
<P>
   Net.Genesis was founded by pals Eric Richard and Matt Cutler in
1994, when they were juniors at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. Richard is the firm's chief technology officer, while
Cutler has been dubbed the ``chief e-business intelligence
officer.''
</P>
<P>
   The company underwent rapid change under Bohn, who was brought
in two years ago. Sales ballooned, and net.Genesis' staff grew from
24 employees in 1998 to 170 today.
</P>
<P>
   Like many technology start-ups, net.Genesis is hemmorrhaging
money even as revenue grows. For the year ended Dec. 31, it lost
$17.9 million on $6.5 million in sales. That compared to a net loss
of $6.4 million the previous year on sales of $1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Investors face other risks.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent federal filing, net.Genesis warned that limits or
bans on cookies _ files that companies plant in computers to
collect information about individuals' Web activities _ could make
its software less effective. To serve its corporate customers,
which include SmarterKids.com and Fidelity Investments, net.Genesis
needs data collected from cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Although many online sites require users to accept cookies to
access their Web pages, consumers are increasingly becoming
concerned about invasions of their privacy. And federal regulators
are starting to look into their complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is gaining momentum,'' analyst Tuen said.
</P>
<P>
   Bohn and other technology executives argue that most information
collected from cookies is used to help e-commerce players cater to
their consumers. And if the federal government cracks down on
cookies, companies can always find other ways to get information on
their shoppers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   `If cookies disappear, God will need a reason to invent them
again,'' said Bohn.

   George W. Bush was expected to beat John McCain in the Virginia
primary and North Dakota caucuses Tuesday, but was in a close
primary race in Washington state. The three contests were not
expected to settle much in the bitter fight between the two unless
Bush loses Virginia _ a potentially fatal blow to his campaign. But
the three contests could set the tone for next week's Super Tuesday
on March 7, when voters in 12 states, including New York,
California and Ohio, hold Republican primaries or caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE THE DELEGATES ARE _ AND AREN'T
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia Republican primary on Tuesday, also open to
Democrats and independents, has 56 delegates at stake, winner take
all. The North Dakota GOP caucuses have 19 delegates at stake,
awarded proportionally. The GOP primary in Washington state, open
to Democrats and independents, has 37 delegates at stake, 12 to be
awarded to today's top vote-getter and 25 at caucuses on March 7.
Washington state's Democratic primary is a nonbinding ``beauty
contest,'' with no delegates at stake.
</P>
<P>
   DEBATE REVERSAL, OF SORTS
</P>
<P>
   It looks like there could be a debate after all between John
McCain and George W. Bush in advance of next week's big round of
Super Tuesday primaries. McCain had canceled plans to take part in
Thursday's debate in Los Angeles, but he reversed himself Tuesday
and said he would debate Bush before next week's California primary
if he can do it by live satellite feed. McCain said he was willing
to change his campaign schedule in New York to appear. He also
offered to debate Bush on Wednesday via satellite on MSNBC's
``Hardball,'' or in person Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
Thursday's debate, to be telecast nationally on CNN, will also
include Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   WHY PULL OUT TO BEGIN WITH? 'TIS A MYSTERY
</P>
<P>
   To Californians, it was all a little baffling. Why would John
McCain pull out of the only Republican debate scheduled in the
nation's largest state the week before the highest-stakes primary
on the political calendar? McCain's decision to withdraw from the
forum Thursday in Los Angeles, citing scheduling conflicts, took
everyone by surprise, including the debate's sponsors, CNN and the
Los Angeles Times. It also caused dissension in McCain's own
campaign: His communications director, Daniel Schnur, was quoted as
saying that the withdrawal was ``definitely a mistake'' and ``a
tactical error at the staff level.''
</P>
<P>
   REGRET AT HOLDING TONGUE
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush expressed regret Tuesday for not speaking up
sooner against anti-Catholic bias. He says he should have done so
when he spoke at Bob Jones University in Greenville, S.C., which
has harbored anti-Catholic sentiment. Bush said he felt ``things
are coming my way'' as voters cast ballots in GOP primaries Tuesday
in Virginia and Washington state and in North Dakota's caucuses.
Bush made plans to appear via satellite on David Letterman's
late-night talk show tonight. Tuesday, he met with Catholic
Charities workers in the half-finished Fatima Family Center, which
will offer social services in Cleveland's impoverished Hough
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   SOME UNEASINESS, BUT STILL BEHIND MCCAIN
</P>
<P>
   Conservative activist Gary Bauer, who endorsed John McCain after
dropping his own presidential bid, said Tuesday the senator's
remarks reflected a ``very personal'' dispute between McCain and
Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell. Bauer said McCain went too far by
comparing the two Christian leaders to ``fringe'' leaders on the
left, but urged conservative voters to support McCain as the
candidate more strongly opposed to abortion and same-sex marriage.
``Politics is an uncomfortable business,'' Bauer said on NBC's
``Today.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE HEART THAN VOTES
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley's presidential campaign stopped in San Francisco on
Tuesday, but left its heart in Washington state, where he hoped
voters would give him a desperately needed boost. Though no
delegates were at stake in Washington _ they will be assigned at
statewide party caucuses next Tuesday _ the Democratic ``beauty
contest'' was important for Bradley after Al Gore defeated him in
Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   END OF THE ROAD IN PACIFIC NORTHWEST?
</P>
<P>
   The National Journal's Political Hotline, citing an anonymous
high-level official in Bill Bradley's campaign, reports that
Bradley will drop out of the presidential race today if he doesn't
win Washington state. Barring that, Bradley is slated to debate Al
Gore in Los Angeles tonight, then take a red-eye to New York, where
polls give him a better shot at notching a significant win March 7.
</P>
<P>
   APPEALING TO LATINOS
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore was in California on Tuesday, addressing a Hispanic
event in Los Angeles and headlining two fund-raisers. Speaking at a
local community center in Cudahy, where nine out of 10 residents is
Latino, Gore called education and health care key to expanding
economic prosperity throughout the Latino community. Gore noted
that over the past seven years, incomes for Latino families have
risen, Latino homeownership has increased, and the Latino
unemployment rate has reached its lowest level in history. But, he
said, more must be done.
</P>
<P>
   WIN THE BATTLE, LOSE THE WAR?
</P>
<P>
   Polls show John McCain tied with George W. Bush in California's
popular vote, but well behind among the Republicans whose votes are
the only ones that count toward choosing California delegates.
McCain said if he wins the overall vote but loses the delegate
race, the Republican Party will have to decide, ``Do they want
somebody who wins the majority or do they want somebody who wins
only Republican votes?''
</P>
<P>
   THE LAST WEEK _ DECISION TIME
</P>
<P>
   Polls in California also show a lopsided Democratic contest,
with Al Gore far ahead. But Bill Bradley insisted, ``Californians
make their decision in the last week. There's no question about
that.'' Bradley and his aides also were completing work on an
unusual, five-minute TV ad to be broadcast Thursday at 10:54 p.m.
PST and EST (9:54 CST and MST) across the country on CBS. ``It's
Bradley speaking personally to voters about his vision for the
country and the basis of his candidacy and why he would be a better
president,'' spokesman Eric Hauser said. The campaign did not
reveal the cost of the ad.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO CUT THROUGH MANAGED CARE
</P>
<P>
   Aetna U.S. Healthcare has decided to continue skilled nursing
care for a baby whose case caught Al Gore's attention. The
company's chief medical officer, Dr. Arthur Leibowitz, said
evaluation of Ian Malone's case was sped up due to Gore's interest.
The baby, now about 5 months old, has brain damage caused by a
difficult birth. He suffers seizures, can't swallow and is prone to
choking. The 12-hour-a-day, in-home nursing care costs about $300 a
day, the Malones said. A reviewer had recommended that nursing care
be terminated and that the family care for the infant full-time.
Leibowitz said the final decision to continue nursing help would
have been made even if the case had not become a presidential
campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   HE'S THE FIREFIGHTER WIELDING THE HOSE
</P>
<P>
   Declaring that ``politics isn't about votes only,'' Alan Keyes
said he won't drop out of the GOP race because he is calling
attention to moral problems in the country. ``I'm not giving up. I
won't give up; America's moral house is on fire,'' he said. In a
speech at Syracuse University, Keyes said George W. Bush hasn't got
a chance to win the presidency. He said Republicans won't win on
economic grounds, because the national economy is strong under
President Clinton's administration.

TECHNOLOGY SHARES LIFT NASDAQ TO ANOTHER RECORD HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices staged a broad, sharp advance in heavy
trading Tuesday. Demand for technology stocks was especially
intense, and the Nasdaq composite index rose to a record.
</P>
<P>
   Led by networking and computer-related stocks, the Nasdaq jumped
118.84 points, or 2.6 percent, to 4,696.69.
</P>
<P>
   The gain capped an amazing month for the index: In February, the
Nasdaq rose more than 19 percent. For the year, the index is up
15.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology, telecommunications and biotechnology are areas
where it is hard to argue with a good story and big promises,''
said Michael Clark, head of United States stock trading for Credit
Suisse First Boston. ``The market loves the story, the growth and
the promise.''
</P>
<P>
   The gains were not limited to stocks listed on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   For a second straight session blue-chip stocks moved higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, helped by big gains in
Hewlett-Packard, AT&AMP;T and General Electric, rose 89.66 points, or
0.9 percent, to 10,128.31.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 18.37, or 1.4
percent, to 1,366.42, led by big gains in Texas Instruments,
Motorola and Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks soared and set a
record.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for small but fast-growing technology and biotechnology
companies helped to propel the Russell 2000 index by 20.03, or 3.6
percent, to a record 577.71. So far this year, the Russell
technology index has jumped 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was heavy.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the Nasdaq stock market set a record Tuesday, at 2.07
billion shares. On the New York Stock Exchange 1.2 billion shares
changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the specter of additional moves by the Federal
Reserve Board to raise short-term interest rates, most analysts
said gains in sectors of the market that are sensitive to rising
rates are likely to be somewhat limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been in a trading range on the Dow of between 10,000
and 12,000 for much of the last year,'' said Philip Orlando, chief
investment officer at Value Line Asset Management. ``We are likely
to stay within that band for a while longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Orlando said that recently he has been a buyer of stocks like
Wal-Mart, International Paper, General Electric and Johnson &AMP;
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Micron Technology, the biggest domestic maker of computer-memory
chips, was one of the session's brightest performers.
</P>
<P>
   Micron shares surged 17 15/16, to 96, spurred by a 10 percent
rise in chip prices over the last week.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, which signed a licensing deal with Psion PLC, Europe's
largest maker of palmtop computers, gained 12, to 170{. The company
later announced a three-for-one stock split.
</P>
<P>
   3Com was another contributor to the S&AMP;P 500's advance.
</P>
<P>
   The stock, which has been a big winner so far this year, soared
again Tuesday in advance of the initial public offering of its Palm
division.
</P>
<P>
   3Com shares jumped 18 15/16, to 98.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology shares were higher.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech rose 11 3/8, to 192~. Immunex closed at 197 7/16, up 6
11/16. And Biogen gained 3 1/16, to 107 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Oil and oil service stocks also did well. Exxon Mobil rose 1
13/16, to 75 5/16. Philips Petroleum gained 1, to 38[.
</P>
<P>
   Among oil service stocks, Halliburton was up 3 5/16, to 38 3/16.
Schlumberger gained 4 33/64, to 73 55/64. And BJ Services closed at
57 1/16, up 4\.
</P>
<P>
   Retailing stocks, which have been under selling pressure so far
this year, did better.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart, a Dow component, gained 2} to 48~. Staples was up 2[,
to 27. And Circuit City rose 4|, to 40 7/16.

ALABAMA'S DEATH ROW JUSTICE SKEWED BY NEGLECTED DEFENSE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SARA RIMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OPELIKA, Ala. _ The desk in Mike Williams' office is a map of
his busy small-town practice. It is stacked with cases. The
under-age Auburn University student charged with possession of
alcohol. The collection of rent for a local real estate agent. The
bitter divorce in which the wife, who is Williams' client, is
charging the husband with adultery.
</P>
<P>
   The case that does not fit is the one partially contained in the
cardboard box on the floor: State of Alabama vs. James Wyman Smith.
Smith, 58, convicted of murdering a convenience-store clerk, had
not had the money to hire a lawyer, and the court had appointed
Williams to represent him at his two trials, even though Williams
had scant experience in the practice of criminal law, not to
mention the complex, ever-changing, high-stakes subspecialty of
capital defense.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had not even read the entire death penalty statute
before his client's first trial in 1987. He had no money to hire an
investigator. The state paid him so little that in a brief to the
court he said he ended up making ``$4.98 per hour to prepare for
the defense of a human's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his office, Williams declared, ``I will go to jail
before I handle another capital case.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith died on death row Feb. 17, of liver failure. A majority of
the public across the country supports capital punishment. But in
states from Illinois to Texas, there is an intensifying debate over
the issue of justice, focusing on the quality of the legal
representation provided to people accused of capital crimes. At its
sharpest, it is a question of whether some innocent people are on
death row only because their state, like Alabama, does not provide
the resources for an adequate or competent public defender system.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-death-penalty Republican governor of Illinois, George
Ryan, recently called for a moratorium on the death penalty after
concluding that 13 innocent people had almost been executed, in
some cases because of dismal defenses mounted by incompetent,
poorly paid lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., recently introduced legislation
that set national standards to ensure that competent lawyers are
appointed for capital defendants. The Justice Department has
initiated its own review to determine whether the federal death
penalty system unfairly discriminates against racial minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Some states, like New York, New Jersey and Colorado, have
multimillion-dollar capital defender offices that provide teams of
top lawyers and investigators for people in death penalty trials.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum is Alabama, which, with a death
row growing at the fastest rate in the country, has no statewide
public defender system. Court-appointed capital defense lawyers
here are paid so little that many lawyers refuse the work.
</P>
<P>
   In cities like Montgomery and Birmingham, where the pool of
lawyers is greater, lawyers can remove themselves from the list of
those willing to be appointed to capital cases. But in smaller
jurisdictions, like Opelika, a judge can compel a lawyer to take a
case, or find the lawyer in contempt for refusing.
</P>
<P>
   So the job often falls to young, inexperienced lawyers, or older
ones who earn a living through court appointments, leaving many of
those charged with capital offenses with inadequate representation
at trial, and some without representation in the appeals process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically these folks are sent into battle underequipped,
undertrained and undercompensated,'' said Kevin Doyle, the New York
capital defender, who spent five years working on capital cases in
Alabama with the federally financed capital defense resource
center, which Congress has since eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Two people on Alabama's death row have been found innocent since
executions were reinstated in the 1970s. Nationwide, there were 85
such cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alabama is our top priority,'' said Elisabeth Semel, who as
head of the American Bar Association's death penalty representation
project in Washington recruits law firms across the country to
handle cases pro bono. ``The need for competent lawyers there is
desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   Numerous studies by legal experts of Alabama's capital defense
system have documented severe shortcomings, including lawyers who
fail to do the most fundamental tasks, like investigating the crime
and their clients' backgrounds and presenting closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
   The Alabama attorney general, Bill Pryor, a Republican, said he
had no concerns about the quality of court-appointed defense
counsel for people in death penalty cases at any stage in the
process, from arrest to death row. ``My judgment is that at both
the trial and appellate level, we face very experienced and
competent opponents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not had the problems they have in Illinois,'' he
added. ``No one can design a perfect system of justice. I would
like to have more resources for the young lawyers who come to work
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Pryor said he is concerned that the appeals process takes too
long, a criticism made by many prosecutors of their state justice
systems. For example, he said, execution is set for Friday, March
3, for Freddie Lee Wright, who has spent 22 years on death row
while lawyers appealed his case.
</P>
<P>
   The 1963 U.S. Supreme Court decision Gideon vs. Wainwright
guaranteed all defendants the right to counsel.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, the state appoints two lawyers to defend each
capital case. Each must have at least five years' experience in
criminal law, but this can include cases like shoplifting and
driving while intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers are appointed to cases, and paid, by elected judges
who, in this staunchly pro-death-penalty state, campaign on their
records of sending defendants to the electric chair. The lawyers
must also apply to the judges for state money to hire experts and
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The state pays court-appointed lawyers. The rate was $20 an hour
for time spent outside court, $40 for court time, plus overhead,
until last year, when it was raised to $30 and $50, plus overhead.
Next fall it goes up to $40 and $60. The payments are also approved
by the judges. Court-appointed lawyers in federal cases are paid
$75 to $125 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi, Texas, Virginia and Georgia also have relatively
low rates of compensation, and none have statewide public
defenders. Mississippi, which has fewer people on death row than
Alabama, pays a flat fee of $1,000 plus overhead for each capital
case.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, defense lawyers here said the money was so little
that they could not afford to prepare a proper defense. They often
spend 50 hours or less on capital cases; adequate preparation,
experts say, should take 500 to 1,000 hours.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One death row inmate, Donald Dallas, had eight court-appointed
lawyers before his trial in 1995 even began, one after another
bailing out because of money and time constraints.
</P>
<P>
   His first lawyer failed to contact him after his arrest and,
without benefit of counsel, Dallas gave police a signed confession.
He was convicted of murdering an elderly woman who died of a heart
attack after he robbed her and locked her in the trunk of a car.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Williams did a far better job than many court-appointed
lawyers, said Bryan Stevenson, a Harvard-educated lawyer in
Montgomery whose nonprofit Equal Justice Initiative office, with a
$575,000 annual budget raised through donations, is representing
more than 100 inmates already on death row.
</P>
<P>
   But appointing lawyers like Williams to handle capital cases, he
said, ``is like asking an overextended general practitioner to do
brain surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson said his office had won 60 reversals of death row
cases in the last 10 years; many of them, he said, could be traced
to errors made by lawyers on both sides, including allowing
racially discriminatory juries and prosecutorial misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   At his desk in his office the other day, Stevenson took a call
from Larry George, who is mentally ill and on death row for killing
two people. ``Do I have a lawyer yet?'' the inmate wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson, who said he and the four other lawyers in his office
are overwhelmed by the cases they have, told George he was still
trying to find him one.
</P>
<P>
   There are 187 people on death row here, twice the number 10
years ago, making Alabama's the third-largest death row per capita
in the country. The death row is expanding so rapidly that Holman
State Prison has run out of room, and 30 inmates are being held at
Donaldson Correctional Center while the space is expanded at
Holman.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Alabama sentenced 27 people to death, more people per
capita than any state in the country. California, with eight times
the population of Alabama, sentenced 31. There are 300 people
awaiting capital murder trials in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has said that everything about the
defendant's life must be taken into account in sentencing. The
defense lawyer has the responsibility to present all evidence about
his client's background _ mental impairment, difficult childhood,
work history, family life, school records _ in an effort to
persuade the jury to spare the client's life.
</P>
<P>
   But a 1996 study by a group opposed to the death penalty found
that in Alabama, court-appointed lawyers spent an average of three
hours trying the penalty phase.
</P>
<P>
   ``The closing arguments alone are going to last an hour and a
half, so that means they're not often presenting any evidence,''
said Stephen B. Bright, a lawyer who heads the Southern Center for
Human Rights, in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Bright handled the appeal of Judy Haney, an Alabama woman who
hired her brother-in-law to kill her husband after he had abused
her and her children for years. Haney's court-appointed lawyer was
so drunk that the trial had to be delayed a day after he was held
in contempt and sent to jail to dry out. The next morning he
returned to the courtroom, and the death penalty was imposed a few
days later.
</P>
<P>
   After several years on death row, Haney was resentenced, to life
imprisonment without parole.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson recently sought clemency for Robert Lee Tarver Jr.,
44, who was convicted in the 1984 murder of a Russell County store
owner. Stevenson contended that Tarver's original lawyer had failed
his client, including in the sentencing phase of the trial, when he
offered no evidence that might have elicited sympathy for him, like
the fact that he was a good father, had strong family ties and had
a drinking problem.
</P>
<P>
   This is not an unusual contention. What is unusual is that the
judge who sentenced Tarver to die later said he would not have done
so had he known these facts.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson's clemency request for Tarver was rejected by Gov.
Donald Siegelman, and the state asked in February that an execution
date be set.
</P>
<P>
   At his one-man office in Birmingham the other day, Wilson
Meyers, a criminal defense lawyer, pulled out a voucher he had
filed recently for representing a 32-year-old man who had been
charged with capital murder and had ultimately received life
without parole.
</P>
<P>
   His itemized bill came to $13,399, including pre-approved
investigator fees of $2,385.
</P>
<P>
   The judge in the case reduced his payment to $4,128, saying that
while Meyers had put in the time, his fees were ``too excessive.''
</P>
<P>
   After paying his investigator and paralegal, Meyers said, the
case would earn him $1,212, which worked out to $5.05 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not have the financial resources to absorb a cut of that
amount,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Opelika, Mike Williams has saved the letters Smith wrote
him regularly during his 14 years on death row, inquiring about his
three children. Williams went to his wake two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think he got a fair trial,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until after the first trial, Williams said, that he
himself fully grasped the legal issues involved. ``It takes two or
three of them to know how to do the fourth one right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been involved with five,'' he added. ``I've done my duty.
I'm not going to do another.''

<P>
   CHERNOKOZOVO, Russia _ The heavy steel doors, freshly painted
for visitors, swung open one by one along a 100-foot-long corridor
to reveal cold cells, gauzy from cigarette smoke and poor
ventilation, where the sallow faces of Chechen men and women peered
out from the shadows _ their eyes frozen by the flash of intruding
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Their guards barked orders at them to ``stand back from the
door!'' or to ``turn around!'' or ``speak up!'' and to report to a
group of visitors on the conditions in this notorious
``filtration'' prison camp. Some who have passed through here have
alleged that brutal beatings and torture have taken place.
</P>
<P>
   Almost in unison, the inmates, their heads covered with shawls
or woolen hats against the chill, reported that everything was
``normal.'' They said the Russian administrators of the camp did
not beat them, or use electric shocks during interrogations, as had
been alleged. Nor, they said, did the Russians poke tear gas
through the portals that served as peepholes in steel outer doors
that sealed them in the communal cells, where they had spent weeks
or months waiting to be released or charged with aiding Chechen
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military, which has been trying to retake the
southern Chechnya region from separatists, guided journalists and
European officials through the camp Monday and Tuesday in an effort
to refute allegations of brutality and torture that former inmates
have made to human rights organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they did, however, a Radio Liberty journalist, Andrei
Babitsky, who was interned here for two weeks in January, said in a
nationally televised interview that he and other inmates were made
to run a gantlet of truncheon-wielding guards who beat all new
prisoners as part of an initiation rite. Babitsky, now back in
Moscow after a month of captivity in Chechnya, also said that on
three nights in January, ``there were cries that showed a person is
experiencing torturing, unbearable pain, and experiencing it for a
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   He also heard guards threatening one inmate, saying ``they would
cut part of his body,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the military's carefully guided tour of Chernokozovo,
Chechnya, on Tuesday, a new field hospital was displayed in the
prison courtyard, but there was no one in residence, and it
appeared to have been set up in the last few days.
</P>
<P>
   Of 817 detainees who have been processed here, according to
Russian military officials, only 99 were still here Tuesday. And
while the inmates told the visitors, in the presence of guards,
that they do not know of incidents of beating and abuse, two
important facts emerged Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   First, according to family members gathered outside the gates,
hundreds of detainees have been bused out of the camp in recent
days. And the inmates said there has been a significant improvement
in their treatment since a new detachment of guards and
administrators took over in early February, after the reports of
brutality emerged.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to stress that this new administration is much
better and that radical changes have taken place after they
arrived, and we are very grateful for that,'' said Makhmail Abu
Akhar, a resident of Grozny, the Chechen capital. He has been
locked up here for two months after being arrested at a checkpoint
when he could not produce his passport.
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to him was a pitiable young man in his 30s named
Ruslan who was crying and tugging at his hat. He appeared to be
mildly retarded and described himself as an invalid unable to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go home,'' he sobbed, ``but I don't have any
documents.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Mikhail Nazarkin, a senior officer from the Russian
Ministry of Justice, told reporters that 80 percent of the inmates
who have passed through this prison since last fall were suspected
of ``participation in illegal armed formations'' in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Russian security services have cleared 452 of them thus far, he
said, and they have been released. Others, still under suspicion,
have been transferred to prisons elsewhere pending action by state
prosecutors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But what was clear from interviews snatched with inmates in a
90-minute tour was that the Russian authorities have cast their net
broadly to arrest undocumented Chechen men and others who may have
been helping Chechen fighters indirectly by caring for the wounded.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That was apparently the case with Ismail Abu Bakar, a
pediatrician by training who said he had been treating wounded
civilians, but perhaps also some fighters, over the months of
bombardment of Grozny and its environs. He was arrested in the
village of Yermolovskaya while helping evacuate a large group of
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was providing medical assistance to these people, and it
doesn't matter if they are militants or nonmilitants,'' he said,
``I am a physician in the first place. If people are sick, is there
any difference between them? But these were mainly peaceful
citizens suffering from the bombardment.''
</P>
<P>
   Five women stood behind the cell door marked No. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to know why we are here, and we don't understand
the reason,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   Another said, ``We have no idea how long they are going to keep
us here.'' She said she was arrested as she was catching a ride on
a bus loaded with wounded civilians and some fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They charged that we helped the militants, that we treated
their wounds,'' she said. ``But actually, because the Russians lack
precision weapons, they were dropping bombs all over the town, and
the wounded were mainly civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Some young men here said they were farmers or laborers who had
been wrongly detained simply because they fit the profile of
Chechens who are supporting the rebels. Several said they were
arrested when they returned to Chechnya from their homes in other
parts of Russia to rescue aged relatives.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I work on a commune,'' said one man. ``They claim I was a
militant, but they don't have to keep me in here. It would be
enough for them to go back to the farm where I was and ask people
what I've been doing for the last 10 years. I have been working on
the land. I am an agricultural worker.''
</P>
<P>
   One former Chernokozovo inmate named Jalil met with
investigators from the Boston-based Physicians for Human Rights
after his release in February. He told them that he and many men
from his village in the Terek River basin were detained in a sweep
Feb. 4 after eight Russian soldiers were killed nearby. When they
reached the prison camp here, he was quoted as saying, they were
greeted by guards who said: ``Welcome to hell. You will have a slow
and cruel death.''
</P>
<P>
   Jalil had to prop himself up on pillows when he was interviewed
in Ingushetia by Doug Ford, a senior investigator for the
physicians' group. Jalil spoke with difficulty at times and said
his mind was not clear after being beaten unconscious four times
while detained. He said he was released only after his sister
raised the 4,000 rubles necessary to buy his freedom.
</P>
<P>
   On both Monday and Tuesday, after the official tour of
Chernokozovo was completed, the bus carrying journalists from the
prison was mobbed by distraught women. Some only suspected that a
beloved son or husband was inside and were trying to find out. They
pounded their fists on the bus and blocked its way while Russian
military escorts barricaded the door from the inside so the
journalists could not speak to the women.
</P>
<P>
   Some scrawled messages in the dust on the bus windows. Others
reached up and pressed notes into the hands of one journalist
hanging out the window. Then guards carrying assault rifles rushed
out of the camp and forced the women away from the bus, knocking
some of them down.
</P>
<P>
   One of the notes handed in through the window simply said,
``Help us.''

POLICE TO REPORT ON MCSORLEY-BRASHEAR ASSAULT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Vancouver Police Department is nearing the end of its
investigation into last week's Marty McSorley-Donald Brashear
assault and could forward its findings to the Crown Prosecutor's
office in British Columbia as early as Wednesday, a police
department spokesperson said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Drennan, constable for the Vancouver PD, said the
investigative team of three, including a sergeant/overseer and two
department investigators, should have the case file on the Crown
Prosecutor's desk by no later than Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this Province, the police department does not lay
charges,'' said Drennan, who said the department was unwilling to
share with the media the scope of the investigation, including how
many people would be interviewed by the investigators. ``All the
information will be forwarded to the Crown Prosecutor _ the
equivalent of the District Attorney in the States _ and that office
will decide if charges are to be layed.''
</P>
<P>
   Drennan confirmed the charge being investigated is assault,
specifically assault with a weapon (i.e. a hockey stick).
</P>
<P>
   McSorley clubbed Brashear to the ice with 2.7 seconds remaining
in the Bruins' 5-2 loss to the Canucks last Monday night at General
Motors Place. The rugged Brashear, who appeared to be knocked cold
on his feet when McSorley struck him over the right temple with his
stick, is recovering from a severe (Grade 3) concussion and likely
won't return before April 9, the conclusion of the NHL's regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   McSorley, unavailable to the media since his initial comments
after the incident, last week was suspended through the conclusion
of the 1999-2000 season, including the playoffs. He is not expected
to comment again before the Crown Prosector determines whether to
push forward with charges.

FAR-FLUNG COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY NOW STRIVES FOR FOCUS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: England, Germany, Texas, Australia)   (See also HONGKONG-TELECOM)  
(jw) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ When Graham Wallace became chief executive of Cable and
Wireless PLC a year ago this week, he had been expected to be the
consummate company man, reluctant to shake up the far-flung
telecommunications company that once symbolized Britain's imperial
reach.
</P>
<P>
   But Wallace quickly began selling pieces of his company,
orchestrating a number of large deals that culminated with the sale
of Cable and Wireless' stake in Cable and Wireless HKT, the Hong
Kong phone company, to Hong Kong's Pacific Century CyberWorks Ltd.
In so doing, Wallace has proved he can defy conventional wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace is reinventing Cable and Wireless from a
telecommunications holding concern with a scattering of interests
around the world into a leaner telecommunications business focused
on serving other business customers, not the more visible but less
profitable consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   With the sale announced Tuesday of Cable and Wireless HKT, in
which the British parent held a 54 percent stake, Wallace may also
be putting his own company on the market. Some analysts said a
throng of hungry rivals in the telecommunications business might be
looking at Cable and Wireless to increase their own size.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace acknowledged the possibility that the sale of Cable and
Wireless might make the parent company more appealing to his
rivals. ``I think we're an extremely attractive company, we have a
unique set of assets,'' he said. ``But whether or not we attract a
bid isn't in my hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace has rid Cable and Wireless of its two largest businesses
aimed at the consumer market. First, he sold Cable and Wireless
Communications, its British consumer telephone, cable and Internet
properties, to NTL, the communications services company, for 8
billion pounds or $12.8 billion in July. Weeks later, he sold the
company's 50 percent stake in the British mobile telephone provider
One 2 One for 3.5 billion pounds or $5.6 billion to Deutsche
Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   An underlying reason for these sales has been to change the
relatively dim perceptions among investors about the worth of Cable
and Wireless, which had been dogged by lingering questions over the
value of a company with assets so far afield.
</P>
<P>
   In typical British understatement, Wallace said: ``All I've done
is taken the array of assets that Cable and Wireless had and said,
`Look, if we want to get rid of this holding company discount we've
got to become a much clearer and more focused player.' '' He added:
``I'm a great believer in focus.If you try to be all things to all
men you just don't have the management or the financial
resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts praise Wallace on his single-minded drive to increase
shareholder value, even if it is at the expense of keeping assets
that have been part of the company's heritage for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you had was a grossly undervalued conglomerate,'' said
Kevin Lapwood, an analyst at Charterhouse Securities Ltd. in
London. ``We're seeing that the sum of the parts are worth more
separately.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's moves seem to be succeeding. Shares of Cable and
Wireless are up 54.4 percent since he took over from Richard Brown,
an American who left to become the chief executive at EDS, the
computer services company based in Plano, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Cable and Wireless is not weighed down by its
investment in Hong Kong, analysts speculate that possible suitors
like Deutsche Telekom, which is looking to expand its footprint
throughout Europe, Bell Atlantic, SBC Communications, the Baby Bell
based in San Antonio, Texas, and MCI WorldCom also may approach
Cable and Wireless.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very surprising if companies didn't look at it,''
said Paul Sharma, an analyst at J.P. Morgan in London. Besides the
Cable and Wireless presence in Europe and a scattering of interests
in Asia and the Caribbean, it also owns a major Internet backbone
in the United States that it bought from MCI. It also owns Optus,
an Australian telephone network.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's constant maneuverings have defied market expectations.
``It's fair to say that Graham has been much more aggressive than
we expected,'' said Lapwood.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping into the shoes of Brown, who had been known as a
freewheeling executive with grand ambitions, was not as hard as it
seemed, Wallace said. ``The big advantage I had is that I knew the
company very well,'' he said. His previous job was as chief
executive of the unit he recently sold to NTL, Cable and Wireless
Communications PLC. ``I didn't have to spend a lot of time having a
strategy review.''
</P>
<P>
   With the sale of Cable and Wireless HKT, Wallace said he planned
to continue building the business from within rather than through
acquisitions. ``We wouldn't want to buy a massive telco with lots
of legacy assets,'' he said. ``That's what were getting out of.''
</P>
<P>
   All or at least part of the proceeds for the Cable and Wireless
HKT sale will be in Pacific Century stock. How long Cable and
Wireless will hold onto that stock, with its high but risky
valuation as an Internet company, remains an open question.
Analysts said it would be hard for Cable and Wireless to dump the
Pacific Century stock quickly, but the company is expected to
continue diluting its stake in Pacific Century.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said the decision over whether to sell Cable and
Wireless HKT to Pacific Century or Singapore Telecommunications was
difficult, and he admitted the choice was somewhat politically
charged. Pacific Century's founder, Richard Li, is the son of Li
Ka-shing, one of Hong Kong's most influential business executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think PCCW's contacts and connections, particularly Richard
Li in Beijing and his family's connections will be a plus,''
Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   Investments bankers here and in Hong Kong negotiated the
transaction. Cable and Wireless was advised by Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
and Greenhill &AMP; Co. Pacific Century was advised by UBS AG's Warburg
Dillon Read and Bank of China International. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. advised Singapore Telecommunications.

CHAIRMAN OF JOINT CHIEFS PROTESTS USE OF U.S. TROOPS OUTSIDE
MISSION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Irritated that American troops had to retreat from
a bottle-throwing mob in Kosovo, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, Gen. Henry Shelton, has written to NATO's supreme
commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, telling him not to use American
troops outside their designated sector.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, according to Pentagon and NATO officials, told Clark
that other countries involved in the NATO peacekeeping operation
had to send more troops to Kosovo before significant numbers of
American troops would again be allowed on a mission outside the
sector assigned to the United States' control.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton sent the letter to Clark a few days after the retreat on
Feb. 20 of 350 American soldiers from Mitrovica. The American
soldiers had been sent to the troubled city, where Albanian and
Serbian residents are at a standoff and where French troops needed
reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials acknowledged Tuesday that Shelton had
concurred with Clark's plan to send the troops from their sector in
southeast Kosovo to Mitrovica before the mission was under way.
</P>
<P>
   Although Shelton had agreed ahead of time to the mission, the
underlying tone of the letter, according to officials, questioned
the wisdom of sending American troops into a volatile situation
involving hostile Serbian civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton's letter, and a mood of discontent about the Kosovo
peacekeeping operation in the Senate Armed Services Committee
during a hearing with Clark Tuesday, reflected anger at European
allies for not contributing as many troops as requested or expected
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Several senators complained that after the United States had led
the air campaign in the Kosovo war, the Europeans had pledged to
lead the peacekeeping in Kosovo but had failed to live up to their
promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more than whiff of hype, where the Europeans talk of
doing more,'' then fail to carry out their commitments in Kosovo,
said Sen. Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the committee, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., asked
Clark why American troops were involved in house-to-house searches
for weapons in Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   Warner recalled that in Somalia, where American troops were
involved in an ill-fated peacekeeping operation in 1992,
house-to-house searches by American soldiers were ruled out as too
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said that in contrast to Somalia, where American troops
were not welcome, the NATO troops in Kosovo were respected and
wanted by large groups of the local population.
</P>
<P>
   But pressing ahead, Warner questioned the utility of a weapons
search in a city that was only a few miles from a porous border
with Serbia across which weapons freely flowed.
</P>
<P>
   Warner asked, ``What was the total number of arms'' seized in
Mitrovica?
</P>
<P>
   Clark replied, ``Twenty-five.''
</P>
<P>
   A NATO official explained after the hearing that the searches
for weapons in Mitrovica were conducted by troops of several
nations and were announced to the community by community leaders
just beforehand so that the searches appeared evenhanded.
</P>
<P>
   Both Albanian and Serbian homes were searched, in north and
south Mitrovica, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Clark said that the Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic, was very much in control in Serbia and that he
was unlikely to be defeated or disappear any time soon.

 &HT;    Heart-transplant golfer has high hopes
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ For many players, it takes years on the PGA Tour before
they can accomplish something significant. Erik Compton will make
history Thursday with one swing.
</P>
<P>
   When Compton's driver strikes his first tee shot in the
Doral-Ryder Open, the 20-year-old Miami native will become known as
the first heart-transplant recipient to compete on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't expect Compton to take a bow when the amateur picks
up the tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's going to be special week,'' Compton said.
``But I don't step up to the first tee and say, `I'm Erik Compton,
the heart-transplant golfer.'''
</P>
<P>
   Making history is nothing new for Compton. When he was 12,
Compton became the youngest heart-transplant recipient at Miami's
Jackson Memorial Hospital. The surgery was performed Feb. 26, 1992,
and Compton got out of the hospital in time to graduate from sixth
grade.
</P>
<P>
   Compton, now a sophomore at the University of Georgia, also was
the first heart-transplant recipient to qualify for the U.S.
Amateur and earn an athletic scholarship to an NCAA school. But
he's not at Doral on a sponsor's exemption just to become a
historical footnote. He wants this to be the start of his journey,
not a stopping point.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at all my friends who have played as amateurs, Aaron
Baddeley (who won the Australian Masters) and Sergio Garcia, I've
played with those guys, and there's not much difference,'' Compton
said. ``The big difference is just getting out here. I've only got
one week to do it. The hardest part is getting out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Compton will have plenty of support this week both inside and
outside the ropes. His mother, Eli, estimates there will be more
than 100 friends and family members at Doral. Compton also will
have Doral's teacher (and his personal coach), Jim McLean, on his
bag.
</P>
<P>
   McLean said he isn't making his PGA Tour debut as a caddy for
ceremonial reasons. He believes Compton, who recently won the
prestigious Palmetto Dunes tournament at Hilton Head, S.C., can
have an impact this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he can make the cut,'' McLean said. ``I know that's not
easy _ it took Tiger Woods eight tournaments (as an amateur) before
he made his first cut. But I will be very surprised if Erik doesn't
play well.''
</P>
<P>
   So would Compton. ``I shot 72 in the pro-am today, and I really
didn't play all that great,'' he said. ``I've just got to get used
to playing with these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Compton played most sports as a kid, but the transplant helped
direct him toward golf because he couldn't do anything too
strenuous for a year after the surgery. McLean believes the way
Compton had to be brought along slowly helped his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He spent a lot of time learning how to use his body properly
without hitting balls because that was all he could do after the
surgery,'' McLean said. ``He also worked on his short game a lot
because it didn't take a lot of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Compton requires no special treatment on the course. At Georgia,
he walks and carries his bag like any other college player. ``I'm
in better shape than a lot of guys out here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Twice a day, usually at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m., he takes four
immunosuppressant pills to make sure his body doesn't reject the
heart. He also faces a hospital stay once a year for several days
to have a biopsy performed on his heart.
</P>
<P>
   But unless his shirt is off, to reveal a small scar where the
surgery was performed, one wouldn't know the ordeal Compton went
through.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why you have transplants, so you can continue living a
normal life,'' said his mother, the director of development for
South Florida Transplant Foundation. ``Erik is no different than
any other amateur golfer out there chasing his dream.''
</P>
<P>
   But Compton is different. Few people have had to deal with the
prospect of death so young in life. Maybe that's why his idol isn't
Woods, but Paul Azinger, who overcame lymphoma four years ago to
return to the winner's circle last month at Hawaii (Azinger,
unfortunately, withdrew from Doral on Monday).
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why a 4-foot putt with 3 inches of break isn't
something he's going to beat himself up over. Compton wants to do
well this week, but he sees the bigger picture.
</P>

CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS CRITICIZE REPUBLICANS FOR INTOLERANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hoping to make Republicans squirm over their visits
to Bob Jones University, House and Senate Democrats introduced a
resolution on Tuesday condemning the college for intolerance and
criticizing its many visitors for staying silent on its virulently
anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
   With speeches decrying bigotry and racism, the Democrats made
clear that it was Gov. George W. Bush's stop at the university, and
his failure to denounce the college's policies, that compelled them
to draw up the resolution. Bush later apologized for not seizing
the chance to condemn the evangelical university's anti-Catholic
teachings.
</P>
<P>
   By heaping criticism on Bush, the Democrats hope not only to
draw attention to a campaign misstep, but also to turn the
university's policies into so much of a political mudbath that any
candidate who has ever spoken there will end up vulnerable. Sen.
John Ashcroft, a Republican who is in a tough re-election bid in
Missouri, has already been criticized for receiving an honorary
degree from the college. Bush's rival for the Republican
presidential nomination, Sen. John McCain, has also condemned the
Bush visit. But on Tuesday it was Democrats who were using it in
hopes of tarnishing Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had not Governor Bush gone to Bob Jones University I doubt if
we would be standing here,'' said Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., at a
news conference that included a Mormon, an African-American and two
Catholic lawmakers, as well as a nun.
</P>
<P>
   With the words of Dr. Bob Jones, the university's president,
calling the papacy ``the religion of anti-Christ and a satanic
system'' as a backdrop, Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y., said the
visits were a silent endorsement of the college's principles, an
endorsement Americans should not tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue here is of a presidential candidate or candidates,
or other people from political life who have gone to Bob Jones
University, and by doing so have said it's OK, that this school is
OK, and it's not,'' said Crowley, who co-sponsored the resolution
with Sens. Harry Reid of Nevada and Robert Torricelli of New
Jersey. ``It's not OK.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans, who also have been embroiled in a separate
dispute for passing over a Catholic priest as House chaplain,
quickly did some condemning of their own.
</P>
<P>
   They accused Democrats of fear-mongering and pandering to
Catholics, a crucial voting block, in an election year. And they
made clear that the resolution was not likely to ever reach the
floor of either the House or Senate. Republicans hold majorities in
both houses of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing is baloney,'' said Rep. Henry Hyde of
Illinois, the dean of Catholics among House Republicans. ``It's
being played for all its worth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are going to adopt a principle that where you go seeking
votes is an indication that you accept the dogmas and doctrines of
the institution to which you are going, what does that say about Al
Sharpton, and the two major Democratic candidates for the
presidency, as well as Mrs. Clinton,'' Hyde said in an interview,
referring to their visits with Sharpton who has been accused of
anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Don Nickles, of Oklahoma, the second ranking Republican in
the Senate, was so angered by the resolution that he said he could
draw up a slew of his own resolutions, if need be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we could have a resolution about Al Gore's acceptance
speech to NARAL, where he basically gave them a blank check,'' he
said, referring to the abortion-rights group. ``Or maybe we could
have a resolution of his acceptance of the gay rights community in
New York, or his acceptance of the unions, where he basically gave
them a veto over any legislation. If they want to play politics, we
can play politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Closing the door to any floor debate on the resolution, Sen.
Trent Lott, the majority leader, said simply, ``I don't expect an
amendment to be offered on Bob Jones or Buddhist temples or
anything else.'' The reference to the Buddhist temples harkens back
to Vice President Al Gore's visit there in 1996 to raise money for
Democrats.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Until this year, stopping off at Bob Jones University raised few
eyebrows, and a long list of politicians, Democrats and
Republicans, did so frequently. Several of McCain's allies have
ties to the school.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the co-chairman of McCain's South Carolina campaign,
Terry Haskins, who is also the state House speaker pro tem and a
Bob Jones University graduate, resigned from the campaign, saying
he disagreed with the way McCain has handled the issue. McCain has
been criticized for capitalizing on the visit by Bush and approving
telephone calls which portrayed Bush as anti-Catholic. Another
adviser, Rep. Lindsey O. Graham, R-S.C., received an honorary
degree from the college.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Rep. Asa Hutchinson and Sen. Tim Hutchinson,
Republicans from Arkansas and brothers, both received their
undergraduate degrees from there.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are now seeking to portray the school's policies as
unconscionable. As Torricelli put it, ``the leaders of Bob Jones
University are to Christianity what the Ayatollah Khoemeni is to
Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Representative Hutchinson called it is impossible to
support the policies and teachings of Bob Jones University, from
which he graduated in 1972. He said he called Dr. Jones, the
president, after the South Carolina primary to let him know that
when reporters called, Jones should not expect him to defend the
university.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly think they are trying to take political advantage
and divide our country and exploit this opportunity,'' Hutchinson
said in an interview on Tuesday. ``But there is ammunition out
there. The fact is you have an indefensible policy at Bob Jones
University.''
</P>
<P>
   The university, on its web site, calls itself
``anti-Catholicism'' and asks why it has become the ``whipping
boy'' of the political establishment. ``If there are those who wish
to charge us with being anti-Catholicism, we plead guilty,'' the
web site says. ``But we are not Catholic-haters.''

 &HT;    Rush is on to win votes in California
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRESNO, Calif. _ John McCain told Californians on Tuesday that
he is the only Republican who can carry the state in the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   As he awaited results from primaries in Virginia and Washington
state and caucuses in North Dakota, the Arizona senator continued
to campaign in the nation's largest state as a candidate with the
broadest appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in California, I have found my Republican friends
yearning for victory ... It's time to put California back in the
winning column,'' McCain said at a news conference in Stockton. ``I
now firmly believe that I, only, can make that happen this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the importance of California's March 7 primary to
his chances against Texas Gov. George W. Bush, McCain reversed
course Tuesday and agreed to participate in a debate with Bush and
Alan Keyes on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he would take part in the CNN-Los Angeles Times
debate via satellite, perhaps from St. Louis. Missouri also will
hold a primary March 7.
</P>
<P>
   But to rearrange his schedule for the debate, McCain said he has
canceled a rally Thursday evening on New York's Long Island. New
York's primary also is March 7, among the 13 contests scheduled for
that day.
</P>
<P>
   None looms as large as California, where McCain aides
acknowledge they trail Bush among Republicans by between 10 and 20
points.
</P>
<P>
   The state offers the primary winner 162 delegates, more than 15
percent of the 1,034 delegates needed to win the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt about the absolute importance of
California,'' McCain said as he rode on his campaign bus from
Stockton to Fresno in California's Central Valley.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will spend five of the next seven days in California,
taking time out for a quick trip to New York and New England for a
last pitch for votes before March 7.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign will stop today at the University of Southern
California, where McCain will tape an edition of MSNBC's
``Hardball'' with Chris Matthews. A similar appearance a few weeks
back at Clemson University was well received. He also will appear
on NBC's ``Tonight Show with Jay Leno.''
</P>
<P>
   Picking up the theme he laid out Monday, McCain blasted two
conservative religious leaders, Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, as
``people who have led our party astray.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men have been critical of McCain. Robertson made strongly
worded anti-McCain telephone calls in Michigan before last week's
Republican primary, which McCain won.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks on Falwell and Robertson have two related goals _ to
paint Bush into an ideological corner that would dissuade moderate
Republicans, independents and Democrats from supporting him and to
demonstrate that McCain is the more electable of the two.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's outreach to independents and Democrats also sets up
the intriguing possibility that Bush could win the Republican vote,
and with it all of California's delegates, but that McCain could
wind up with more votes overall in the state's open primary.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to know at this point how likely that outcome is, but
McCain supporters already are using the possibility to suggest that
McCain's campaign could go on even if Bush wins the state's
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a split decision ... then that's going to have to
be a debate that takes place within the Republican Party. Do they
want someone who wins a majority or someone who only wins
Republican votes,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   California Secretary of State Bill Jones, a McCain supporter who
backed Bush until recently, said he would urge the Republican Party
to change its rules. ``The parties would be wise to be guided by
the results of the blanket primary, whatever their rules, for their
own good,'' Jones said.

WRITING ON THE EDGE OF SILENCE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 5) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Recitativo Oscuro,'' the title of the concerto by Salvatore
Sciarrino that Maurizio Pollini will play this week at Carnegie
Hall, with Pierre Boulez and the London Symphony, is consistent
with others in this composer's recent output, where ideas of night
and darkness often lurk. But the embodiment of such ideas here is
far more incisive, more vehement and, indeed, louder than has been
usual for Sciarrino.
</P>
<P>
   The work is more characteristic in its slow, unyielding tempo,
and so its sense of an inexorable clock, against which the musical
gestures may propose more fluid and human ways of telling time.
Here they do so under conditions of extremity, even panic, which is
dramatically expressed, but more typically the pressures on and in
Sciarrino's music are so severe they almost stifle any sound at
all.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always so. Sciarrino, who was born in Palermo, Italy,
in 1947, made his name in the early 1970s for music of fluorescent
if gentle brilliance, often playing in the high treble, using
unusual effects and making a show of instrumental virtuosity. In
his newer scores, the dynamic levels have remained spectral, but
the substance has become more attenuated.
</P>
<P>
   Virtuoso demands are now most likely to center on precision, on
the ability to act with maximum intensity and immediacy at the
right moment, and on playing at the edge of silence, or rather, at
the fuzzy boundary where the barely audible draws the keenest
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Generalizations, though, are hazardous. Sciarrino is a believer
in hard work, and his output includes concert and theater pieces of
all kinds, few of which have been performed here (despite his
European standing as a dominant composer of his generation) and
none too many recorded. He has also extended himself to produce
numerous arrangements, of Mozart, of medieval and Baroque music and
of songs by Johnny Mercer and others.
</P>
<P>
   Two recent CDs show something of the range of his recent
chamber-scale pieces. One, on the Kairos label, offers a program of
Gesualdo arrangements and Tasso recitations leading toward
``Infinito Nero'' (``Black Infinity''), based on the mystical
utterances of St. Maria Maddalena de' Pazzi. As Sciarrino tells the
story in his note on the piece: ``Maria Maddalena was attended by
eight novices: four repeated what she said, because she spoke much
too fast to write it all down at once, and the other four wrote
everything down. She did not `speak' _ words actually shot out of
her like a machine gun, and then she fell silent for a long
period.''
</P>
<P>
   Sciarrino's musical and dramatic realization of this behavior is
engrossing, chilling and moving. Instrumentalists, from a small
group, suggest the sounds of breathing, of panting and of
heartbeats: this is music right on the verge of being sound effect,
but the gestures are so varied, so exactingly conceived and so
tightly played that while conveying natural sounds with exceptional
accuracy, they mean more.
</P>
<P>
   One might imagine that they speak for Maria Maddalena's body,
waiting to be overtaken by her reeling mind, or that they stand for
her attendants, watching her in expectation.
</P>
<P>
   When the words come, they come in prestissimo flashes,
especially in the first half of the piece; the composer's
machine-gun image is apt. The voice stammers in a high register, on
the edge of ululation, and is sliced or chopped off by an
instrumental action.
</P>
<P>
   As the piece proceeds, the declamation becomes more continuous
and arrives at something like a fragment of a nursery tune, which
the saint-singer cannot get out of her head. It gets fixed into the
instrumental music, too, as the half-hour piece moves toward its
pinpoint close in the upper treble.
</P>
<P>
   Sonia Turchetta and the Ensemble Recherche give a performance
that grows more disturbing and surprising with repetition. They are
also responsible for ``Le Voci Sottovetro'' (``Voices Under
Glass''), which comes from Sciarrino's recent obsession with the
music and history of Gesualdo, the source of an opera and music for
a puppet play as well as this sequence of four arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   At times the adaptation of Gesualdo for modern instruments
quaintly recalls the period, 40 years ago, of Stravinsky's
``Monumentum pro Gesualdo.'' But Sciarrino's abrupt changes of
color and register are distinctive, as is his dramatization of the
dialogue of different ages in the grating of nonvibrato strings,
sounding like viols, against warm, modern woodwinds.
</P>
<P>
   In its final movement, the piece really becomes something
special. By leaving just one singer in a five-part madrigal,
``Moro, Lasso,'' and giving the other parts to instruments,
Sciarrino suggests the bottled-in voice of his title. Or perhaps
the instrumental voices are the bottled ones, no longer able to
verbalize. There are attacks here, too, that have the scary
immediacy of ``Infinito Nero.''
</P>
<P>
   The other new CD, on Stradivarius, includes instrumental pieces
played by the Alter Ego ensemble, which has a close feeling for
Sciarrino's softnesses: the softnesses of intimate touch and
breathing. One of the most beautiful works in the selection is ``Lo
Spazio Inverso'' (``Inverse Space''), for barely blown flute with
matchingly gentle, caressing, impalpable sounds from clarinet,
violin, cello and celesta.
</P>
<P>
   Other pieces for three or four instruments are interleaved with
a violin fragment, longer solos for flute and clarinet, and _ like
a wound _ the violently reiterative Fourth Piano Sonata.

new books:
</P>
<P>
   ``ROBIN HOOD WAS RIGHT'' &QL; 
By Chuck Collins and Pam Rogers (Norton, $28.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wait! Don't mail those checks yet. Collins and Rogers have
advice about charitable giving that will help you donate your money
with thought and purpose rather than with guilt and self-interest.
Americans gave $109 billion to charity last year, yet one in four
top earners gave nothing, the wealthy gave smaller portions of
their assets than did the poor, and only 13 percent of the money
went to direct public benefit through human service programs (most
went to churches, the arts, elite private universities and
hospitals). Here, the authors attempt to redefine modern
philanthropy in order to affect change _ instead of focusing on the
immediate symptoms of social or economic problems, they want our
dollars to chip away at the CAUSES of those problems. Collins and
Rogers are dedicated, energetic, knowledgeable and frankly, a bit
daunting in their zeal. But you'll learn something if you listen to
them. As Alfre Woodard writes in her preface, ``Robin Hood was
right. And he had a damn good time.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``HAWKE'S COVE'' &QL; 
By Susan Wilson (Pocket, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's one for the ``Bridges of Madison County'' crowd, another
novel that attempts to parlay yearning and denial into a bad but
bittersweet bestseller. A young journal-keeping woman named Vangie
retreats to her grandmother's farm in a small coastal town (note
the title) to recover from the death of her baby and to wait for
news of her husband, who is overseas fighting in World War II. It's
not long before a down-on-his-luck stranger named Joe shows up, and
we know what that means. Vangie hires him to work on the farm, they
drink tea and lemonade, they watch each other through lowered
lashes, they swim (``There is,'' Wilson writes, ``a strange
intimacy in swimming . . .''), she spreads ointment on his
blistered hands. When Vangie's husband is declared missing in
action, she and Joe have a hot night together in the hayloft, but
word comes the very next morning that the husband is still alive.
Denial commences. Years pass. Violins play. Their children grow up
and get nosey. Have you been here before? You betcha. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``FOREVER LIESL'' &QL; 
By Charmian Carr (Viking, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We were hoping to find some dirt here, but according to Carr,
there was precious little of it on the set of ``The Sound of
Music.'' Until now, the only relief from the unrelenting sweetness
of the film was an anecdote about Christopher Plummer, who played
Baron von Trapp and who allegedly hated the movie so much he called
it ``The Sound of Mucus.'' But Carr, who played the von Trapp
daughter Liesl, debunks that story, saying that Plummer himself
denies it (he did despise the song ``Edelweiss'' and tried to have
it tossed from the film). Mostly, this book is a cheerful report on
a cheerful experience, with some funny moments on the side. When
she attended the Mexican premiere (the film was called ``La Novicia
Rebelde,'' or ``The Rebellious Novice''), the unsuspecting Carr was
taken to a bullfight. The matador dedicated the bull to her, and
she watched in horror as the bull was tormented by the matador and
the matador was then run over by the bull. She visited the matador
in the hospital, as Liesl certainly would have done if she'd been
there. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``THE VISION OF EMMA BLAU'' &QL; 
By Ursula Hegi (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hegi's new novel is a family saga that begins in the early
1900s, when scrappy teenager Stefan Blau comes to America from
Germany (specifically from Burgdorf, which figures into Hegi's
earlier books, ``Stones From the River'' and ``Floating in My
Mother's Palm''), and sets out to make his fortune. After a fire in
the New York restaurant where he works, he leaves the city and goes
to a small town in New Hampshire because a fellow immigrant has
told him it reminded him of Germany. There, Stefan marries twice
and loses both wives to the births of his children before he
returns to Burgdorf to bring back and marry Helene Montag, his
childhood friend and the character through which Hegi explores the
difficult adjustment of the German immigrant. Serving as a backdrop
for the story is the Wasserburg, the grand and glorious apartment
building that Stefan builds, which reflects the fortunes of his
family. Hegi's characterization is superb, part of a story that is
as well-constructed as the Wasserburg itself.  &QL;

INHERITING THE WORLD: AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY AFTER THE COLD WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORMAN LEVINE  
 c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic  
 ALSO MOVING IN THE ``A'' CATEGORY 
 RETRANSMITTING INHERITING-1, INHERITING-2 and INHERITING-3 FOR
THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE MISSED THIS SPECIAL PACKAGE BY NORMAN LEVINE 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past hundred years, the United States has had three great
debates over foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   From 1914 to 1917, President Wilson led the country into World
War I to make the globe ``safe for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1947 to 1949, America mobilized against Soviet communism,
and George F. Kennan devised the ``containment policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the nation prepares to select its first president of the
21st century, it has entered its third great debate, and the
question, baldly put, is this: Now that we have inherited the
world, how shall we rule it?
</P>
<P>
   What is at stake in the outcome of this debate is nothing less
than the peace and prosperity of all Americans in the coming
century. Fortunately, America is at peace at the moment, but with
the demise of the Soviet Union as the second-greatest superpower,
many areas of instability and threat have surfaced on international
waters. Terrorism, the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons to rogue states such as Iraq, Iran and North
Korea, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism have brought a series of
mortal challenges to America's doorstep. The United States must
redefine its global role once again, for that act of
self-definition is vital to the security of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, it is only every four years, at the time of the
presidential election, that Americans come to face these
life-and-death issues for themselves and for their children.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions in which this discussion takes place are uniquely
different from the 1914-17 and 1947-49 periods. Today, because of
its victory over Politburo totalitarianism, the United States
stands alone as the Earth's only superpower.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War consensus, based on a bipolar standoff between the
United States and the Soviet Union, has imploded, and in the place
of this consensus a bewildering diversity of opinions has emerged
from the Washington foreign policy elites on how to manage Pax
Americana.
</P>
<P>
   These voices can be grouped into four categories, two
conservative and two liberal.
</P>
<P>
   On the right, the two camps are the Conservative Moralists and
the Conservative Realists. On the left, the two camps are the
Liberal Moralists and the Liberal Realists.
</P>
<P>
   The Dupont Circle area in Washington, D.C., is the miracle mile
of the foreign policy research establishment. Within the 20036 ZIP
code, it is only a five-minute walk among the Johns Hopkins School
of Advanced International Studies (Madeleine Albright's alma
mater), the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the
American Enterprise Institute. This is contested turf, a brutal
scrimmage line, for this ZIP code is a kind of foreign policy
football field in which Republican and Democratic advocates block
and tackle fiercely.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed Establishment casual, comfortable in a blue woolen
sweater, Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, told ``The Arizona Republic'' in January,
``The United States must be more assertive in advancing the
enlargement of democracy around the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and fellow conservative Bill Kristol, editor of the
influential journal the ``Weekly Standard,'' coined the phrase
``benevolent American hegemony'' as a flashcard for their views on
U.S. foreign policy. (``Hegemony'' is code for ``we're in
charge.'')
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and Kristol are the leading exponents of what we will call
the school of Conservative Moralists. A deep strain of moralism
runs through their thinking, because they are unflinching in their
belief that democracy should be the universal form of government,
and they do not shy away from the fact that it may be necessary to
intervene in the affairs of other sovereign states if that is
necessary to bring them the American idea of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   A DAPTING WILSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even though Kagan denies it, the Conservative Moralists are
indebted to the idealism of Woodrow Wilson. One part of Wilsonian
thought was to convince the world of the superiority of democracy,
and this is the part that Kagan and Kristol follow. Another part of
Wilson's thought was the belief that national interests should be
sacrificed to a League of Nations, and both Kagan and Kristol
reject this part.
</P>
<P>
   The school of Conservative Realists, whose most distinguished
practitioner is Henry Kissinger, rejects the moralism of Kagan and
Kristol. All the members of the realist school acknowledge that
democracy is the most desirable form of government, but they deny
that the United States has the missionary purpose of converting the
entire planet to democracy. For this camp, the proper end of
American diplomacy is the preservation of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger and like-minded policymakers are realists in the sense
that they see the world as made up of competing, self-interested
nations. For them, diplomacy is a jungle. In the spirit of Ronald
Reagan, this group is skeptical about international organizations,
although they see their usefulness. They also draw a line in the
sand between internationalism and the preservation of national
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Realism is a doctrine that favors unilateral action
to defend the national self-interest of the United States. It
doubts the effectiveness of multilateral action _ for example, the
U.N. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, which is widely acknowledged
to be a failure. The members of this school argue that the
multinational United Nations never has demonstrated its ability to
efficiently carry out its peacekeeping responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Straight and elegant, her mind as sharp as a quarterback in a
fourth-and-one-situation, Jeane Kirkpatrick, ambassador to the
United Nations under Ronald Reagan and now a professor at
Georgetown University and senior fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, disagrees with the Kagan-Kristol School. A strong voice
within the conservative movement, Kirkpatrick doubts that democracy
can be spread through interventionist methods.
</P>
<P>
   REAGAN'S WAY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald Reagan, whom I admired as a great president,''
Kirkpatrick said, ``understood the sanctity of national
independence. The U.N. is a useful tool. All international
organizations are useful tools. I am not opposed to the U.N. But
one principle that Reagan stood by, and that I stand by, is that
the U.S. must never surrender its sovereignty or national
self-interests to any international organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign policy agenda of the Republican Party is made up of
both Conservative Moralists and Realists. Gov. George W. Bush
himself stands squarely in the faction of Conservative Realism.
Many members of the realist school, including Condoleezza (EDITORS:
CORRECT) Rice, Elliot Abrams, Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz
(EDITORS: CORRECT) (all of whom held high foreign policy positions
in either the Reagan or Bush administrations), are currently
advisers to the present Bush presidential campaign. John McCain is
also a Conservative Realist, and one of his foreign policy advisers
is Henry Kissinger. Neither the Conservative Moralists nor Realists
are isolationists.
</P>
<P>
   The liberal Establishment also fields a team within the 20036
ZIP-code playing field, and the expertise of the Brookings
Institute is certainly playoff quality. Although it is primarily a
research center for scholars from all over the world, and as such
its public image must be as objective, the Woodrow Wilson Center,
yards away from the Dupont Circle, currently is headed by Lee
Hamilton, who presented to ``The Republic'' the arguments of the
Liberal Moralists.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat and former member of Congress, Hamilton was chairman
of the House Foreign Relations Committee. Stately, and possessed of
a typical Hoosier friendliness, Hamilton said, ``The Republicans
are too quick to defend unilateral intervention. Even though
international organizations are imperfect, America must learn to
work in cooperation with them.''
</P>
<P>
   CARTER LEGACY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The political heritage of the Liberal Moralists grows out of the
unusual alliance among Wilson, Jimmy Carter and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   From Wilson, the Liberal Moralists take the ideas of the
dissemination of democracy, as well as a commitment to collective
security and internationalism. From Jimmy Carter, they borrow the
dogma of universal human rights, which includes the rights of
women, children and labor.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Vietnam served as a bloody lesson that the arrogant,
unilateral exercise of U.S. power can produce the diplomatic
isolation of the United States. Like the Conservative Moralists,
Liberal Moralists also advocate an expansive role for democracy and
the capitalist system. Unlike both the Conservative Moralists and
Realists, the Liberal Moralists are suspicious of unilateral
intervention as a means of disseminating democracy and human
rights. Liberal Moralists prefer to act within multilateral
institutions, such as the United Nations. For example, Liberal
Moralists favor humanitarian intervention under the umbrella of the
United Nations. The American involvement in Kosovo is presented as
a model of humanitarian intervention, for in this case the United
States became engaged to prevent the continued slaughter of
Kosovars, but under the aegis of the multilateral United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that globalization was one of the dominant
tendencies of the last decade of the 20th century, Liberal
Moralists are free-traders. A large corporatist faction exists
within Liberal Moralists, because multinational corporations see
the opportunity to harvest huge profits from the
internationalization of trade.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Realists speak the language of national self-interest
and not the tongue of democratic moralism. Like the Conservative
Realists, their brethren the Liberal Realists take a dim view of
the idea that the purpose of American diplomacy is the conversion
of the globe to democracy. They also view the goal of international
relations as the preservation of American nationhood.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their conservative brethren, however, Liberal Realists
perceive contemporary international relations as multipolar. They
stress the importance of the United States' working in harmony with
multilateral organizations because they see the danger of causing a
reaction against the American imperium. If the United States were
to pursue a unilateralist course of action, the Liberal Realists
argue, this would result in the undesirable development of an
``anti-hegemonist'' camp _ the alliance of Russia, China and Iran
to halt American primacy.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON OPPOSED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent members of the Liberal Realist camp are three
academicians: Professors Michael Mandelbaum and Robert W. Tucker
(emeritus) of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International
Studies and Professor Ronald Steel of the University of
California-Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   True to their belief that America must show great restraint
before exercising unilateral action, the Liberal Realists opposed
the Clinton policy of NATO expansion. Mandelbaum's book ``The Dawn
of Peace in Europe'' is the classic statement against the need for
NATO enlargement on the grounds that it would drive Russia and
China together. Tucker's book ``The Imperialist Temptation''
criticized President Bush's Operation Desert Storm because it
represented U.S. overreach, extending U.S. responsibilities from
Western Europe, the original site of the American-Soviet standoff,
to the Persian Gulf, a colossal stretch of American national
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy is an outgrowth of Liberal Moralism.
Although there are significant differences in terms of their
foreign policy, both Al Gore and Bill Bradley are members of the
Liberal Moralist wing of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The grand foreign policy debate of the new millennium, the
search for the Second Coming of George F. Kennan, is essentially an
in-house dialogue among inhabitants of the Washington policy think
tanks. During the Kosovo entanglement the American people were
activated by TV war imagery to think about America's role in the
world, but Kosovo is over, and Americans again have turned their
gaze inward. It is Social Security, medical insurance, education
and taxes that consume their interest in this election year and not
``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   As Norman Ornstein, a specialist on Congress at the American
Enterprise Institute, pointed out, ``63 percent of the House of
Representatives were elected after the fall of communism.'' The
amount of money spent on agencies in the U.S. government dealing
with foreign affairs has been cut by Congress. The amount of money
given to international organizations also has been diminished. It
is truly a new world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that Congress is isolationist,'' Ornstein suggested,
``it is rather that Congress is insular. Domestic needs have taken
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is a terrorist act of great bestiality, unless the
TV screen can show decapitated bodies and mangled limbs, Americans
will elect their first chief executive of the new century on issues
relating to homosexuality and abortion rather than on this
transformative moment of how the U.S. colossus should behave in the
world after it inherited this wondrous sphere.  &QL;

U.S. FOREIGN POLICY, THE DEMOCRATIC WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (LAST IN A SERIES OF THREE ARTICLES. ALSO MOVING IN THE ``A''
CATEGORY  &UR; - RESENDING INHERITING-1, INHERITING-2 AND INHERITING-3
FOR THOSE WHO MAY HAVE MISSED THIS SPECIAL PACKAGE. The author
 &UR; examines the Democratic ``Liberal Moralist'' and ``Liberal
Realist''
 &UR; positions in the debate over the direction of American foreign
policy.)
</P>
<P>
   The American people are undergoing an out-of-body experience:
History is repeating itself, and they have been transferred back to
1920 and the battle waged by Woodrow Wilson and Henry Cabot Lodge
over America's entry into the League of Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson wanted both to make the world ``safe for democracy'' and
for the United States to obey the covenant of the League of
Nations, irrespective of national self-interest. His opponent was
Lodge, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and
although Lodge favored America's entry into the League, he wished
to modify certain articles as a means of preserving U.S. national
self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson refused to make any concessions and, in 1920, the League
went down to defeat. The conservatives of 2000 are the spiritual
descendants of Lodge, while present-day liberals inherit the legacy
of Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   As a liberal moralist, Clintonian foreign policy is an amalgam
of Wilson, Jimmy Carter's ``universal human rights'' and reaction
against the Vietnam War with its rejection of unilateral action by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After initial hesitation in 1993, Clintonian diplomacy shattered
the boundaries of the containment of Communism theory articulated
by George F. Kennan, a foreign-policy expert and diplomat, at the
beginning of the Cold War. Essentially a strategy to halt further
imperialism of the Stalinist empire, containment theory limited the
extension of American power to the Elbe, which, from 1947 to 1990,
was the eastern border of Germany. &QL; 
NATO EXPANSION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy committed itself to the enlargement of
the horizon of democracy, and Clinton pursued this goal on two
fronts: expansion of NATO in Europe and support of Boris Yeltsin in
Russia. When Clinton embarked on the jihad of making the world safe
for democracy, he not only embraced this aspect of Wilsonism but
capitulated to the arguments of Anthony Lake, his first national
security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Doctrine brought Poland, the Czech Republic and
Hungary into NATO. By including these three countries under the
NATO umbrella, the United States committed itself to the defense of
countries it never previously considered within its own sphere of
national self-interest. This enormous broadening of American
guarantees was justified under the principle of missionary
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In expanding NATO, Clinton broke American implied agreements
with Mikhail Gorbachev. ``A World Transformed,'' written by George
Bush, who was president at the time of the disintegration of the
Soviet Empire in Eastern Europe, and Brent Scowcroft, Bush's
national security adviser, is unequivocal on this point: At no time
did Bush, Scowcroft, or Secretary of State James Baker indicate to
Gorbachev that NATO would be extended eastward to Poland, the Czech
Republic and Hungary after the Soviets voluntarily renounced their
title to these tracts of land.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy toward Yeltsin was another case of missionary
democracy. The Clinton administration adamantly supported Yeltsin
on the grounds that he was leading the democratic capitalist
transformation of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   However, Yeltsin's resignation from office and the crowning of
Vladimir Putin as his successor is a serious setback for the
Clinton doctrine. Putin's recent alliance with the Communists
belies the assertion that democracy is functioning in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lee Hamilton, Democratic loyalist, respected former
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and current
director of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, Putin's recent coalition
with the Communists ``amounts to a defeat for Clinton, for it
strengthens the power of the Communists in the Duma.'' &QL; 
PUSHING MULTILATERALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another Wilson ideal that the Clinton doctrine continues is that
American diplomacy should unfold within multilateral institutions.
Liberal moralists are suspicious of unilateral actions because they
fear it will give rise to worldwide anti-Americanism.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the fact that recent ventures in which America
acted under the aegis of the United Nations _ such as in Somalia,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo _ all appear to be failures, the
White House still upholds the usefulness of multilateralism. The
Oval Office fears the bully backlash _ that other nations will
express their resentment against the paramountcy of the United
States by opposing American policies.
</P>
<P>
   Another principle of liberal moralism to which the Clinton
doctrine abides is free trade.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal moralism wishes to turn the movement toward economic
globalization to an advantage for the United States, and so Clinton
has devoted much effort to the reduction of tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wishes to use trade as a form of social engineering,
because he hopes that free trade will encourage the growth of a
capitalist entrepreneurial class in countries making the transition
out of communism, like China. Borrowing a phrase from his former
economic adviser, Andrea Tyson, Clinton thinks in terms of
``strategic trade,'' or trade with a deeper purpose than just
making a profit.
</P>
<P>
   In its approach to China, the Clinton doctrine combines the
strategic trade and the ``strategic partner'' approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The theory of the strategic partner is to detach China from any
``anti-hegemonist'' bloc alliance. Primarily, this means preventing
the re-creation of the Cold War Sino-Soviet coalition. &QL; 
OVAL OFFICE'S PLAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hook of strategic trade is associated with the universal
human-rights theory of Carter. By its use of strategic trade, the
Oval Office hopes to ensnare President Jiang Zemin into granting
more ``human rights'' to Chinese citizens. The ultimate aim of
trans-Pacific social engineering is to both speed the development
of a commercial middle class in China and to provide these
entrepreneurs with the protective shield of civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives of all camps attack the Clinton doctrine on China
as a contradiction between rewards and punishments.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting upon the differences that separate Republicans and
Democrats, Democratic loyalist Hamilton told ``The Arizona
Republic,'' ``Republicans are very skeptical of international
organizations, such as the U.N., the World Trade Organization and
the like. Democrats generally support these multilateral
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a monopolar world in the social and economic
sense. Even though the U.S. is the only superpower in the military
or `hard' sense, it cannot dictate to all nations of the globe in
matters of gender, children, values or culture. In terms of `soft'
power _ education, information and trade, this is a multipolar
world and the U.S. must learn to act in conjunction with
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to recognize that the most important lever of
diplomatic power has changed from `hard' to `soft' power. To me,
trade is the crucial issue.'' &QL; 
PARTY SPLIT ON POLICIES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans tend to stress military power,'' Hamilton
added. ``I am an unrepentant free-trader because I believe that
unrestricted trade, from which all sides benefit, is the best way
to export the democratic order.''
</P>
<P>
   But policies are divisive ones within the Democratic Party. To
hold the presidency again in November, Democrats desperately need
the support of American labor, and the AFL-CIO has already endorsed
Vice President Al Gore. Nevertheless, a divorce has taken place
between the corporatist and labor wings of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The corporatists favor strategic trade and China's entry into
the World Trade Organization, because they will be the ``winners''
from the globalization of trade, while Big Labor is opposed to
these policies, because they will be the ``losers'' when domestic
wages are repressed. The Seattle meeting of the World Trade
Organization ended in chaos when Big Labor and environmentalists
led street demonstrations demanding environmental protections, an
end to child labor in China and other Asian countries and
improvement of working conditions before any further reduction of
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   The issues of China and world trade will be hotly debated along
partisan lines when Congress is called on to approve China's entry
into the World Trade Organization in the fall, and they will play a
major role in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has already become a victim of the Democratic dependency on
Big Labor. Gore suffers from a split personality: one face as vice
president and the other as party candidate. As vice president, he
speaks in favor of the Clinton doctrine, but as candidate he must
massage the labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, Gore's divided personality made the front pages
when the AFL-CIO criticized him for placing the reduction of
tariffs before the increase of wages, the growth of labor unions
and the end of sweat shops in Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of Gore's problems with the labor unions, he is also a
Liberal Moralist. In the war of words currently waged in opinion
journals, Stephen M. Walt, a professor of international relations
at Harvard University, has acted as the vice president's script
writer. In an article in the March/April issue of ``Foreign
Affairs,'' Walt has written a Democratic response to the Republican
broadsides that were published by ``Foreign Affairs'' in the
previous issue. The vice president's proxy only proved that on
foreign affairs, Gore is a clone of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley is also a Liberal Moralist and although there are
no significant differences between Gore and Clinton, there are
important divisions between Gore-Clinton and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore-Clinton favor an increase in the defense budget, but
Bradley advocates a cut in appropriations for the Defense
Department. Bradley would use the money saved from the military
spending for his domestic agenda such as his health and
anti-poverty programs. Bradley is also far more attuned to the
growing gulf between the cyberspace Atlantic world and the
spinning-wheel Third World.  &QL; 
`BULLY BACKLASH' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Liberal realists, particularly professor Michael Mandelbaum of
the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, agrees
with Clinton-Gore that it is vital to work within multinational
organizations, but he dissents from the Clinton doctrine on the
issue that America should become a global proselytizer for
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelbaum led the charge against the expansion of NATO because
he feared the ``bully backlash.'' Mandelbaum's essay, ``Foreign
Policy as Social Work,'' appeared in the January/February 1996
issue of ``Foreign Affairs.'' In the essay, he criticized Clinton
for seeking to turn the United States into the messiah of
constitutional government.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelbaum wrote of Clinton and Lake, his first national
security adviser: ``They tried and failed to turn American foreign
policy into a branch of social work.''
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy, Mandelbaum and the entire liberal
realist camp argues, has overextended and overtaxed U.S. resources
around the world. The liberal realists oppose intervention in the
internal affairs of other sovereign states, and they reject the
notion that America can play the world's shrink, using the methods
of a social worker to aid the dysfunctional.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican or Democratic candidate in the current campaign
embraces isolationist or protectionist positions. As the new
century dawns, the United States is experiencing instant historical
replay. The First World War is over, the Treaty of Versailles is
written, and America in 2000 must decide whether it will sign the
League of Nations in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   All those who favor close collaboration with international
organizations, forgoing all instances of unilateral intervention,
will vote for Woodrow Wilson. All those who favor the retention of
full American self-interest, the need for unilateral intervention
to further national security, will vote for Lodge. But whatever
your vote, you must face the consequences: If Americans can put
aside their obsession with the marrying-a- multimillionaire
melodrama, they will bear in mind that history is a life-and-death
sentence, that it repeats itself, and the Second World War followed
the First.  &QL;

<P>
   BERLIN _ A state prosecutor in Darmstadt charged three American
teen-agers on Tuesday with murder and attempted murder for pushing
large rocks off a pedestrian bridge onto a highway.
</P>
<P>
   Two women, ages 20 and 41, were killed on Sunday and five others
injured when the football-sized rocks smashed through their
windshields and their cars went out of control.
</P>
<P>
   The boys, who were not named, have been identified as the
children of American soldiers at a nearby U.S. military base. With
73,000 American soldiers still stationed in Germany, the case is
politically delicate.
</P>
<P>
   The Darmstadt base, near Frankfurt, is close to the pedestrian
bridge from which the youths, 14, 17 and 18 years old, pushed the
stones onto a secondary road between Heidelberg and Frankfurt. A
third youth, of 15, was initially detained but was not charged.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said the youths had told them they regularly
went to the bridge to drop stones before the fatal incident on
Sunday.

   The American people are undergoing an out-of-body experience:
History is repeating itself, and they have been transferred back to

over America's entry into the League of Nations.
</P>

   Wilson wanted both to make the world ``safe for democracy'' and
for the United States to obey the covenant of the League of
Nations, irrespective of national self-interest. His opponent was
Lodge, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and
although Lodge favored America's entry into the League, he wished
to modify certain articles as a means of preserving U.S. national
self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson refused to make any concessions and, in 1920, the League
went down to defeat. The conservatives of 2000 are the spiritual
descendants of Lodge, while present-day liberals inherit the legacy
of Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   As a liberal moralist, Clintonian foreign policy is an amalgam
of Wilson, Jimmy Carter's ``universal human rights'' and reaction
against the Vietnam War with its rejection of unilateral action by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After initial hesitation in 1993, Clintonian diplomacy shattered
the boundaries of the containment of Communism theory articulated
by George F. Kennan, a foreign-policy expert and diplomat, at the
beginning of the Cold War. Essentially a strategy to halt further
imperialism of the Stalinist empire, containment theory limited the
extension of American power to the Elbe, which, from 1947 to 1990,
was the eastern border of Germany. &QL; 
NATO EXPANSION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy committed itself to the enlargement of
the horizon of democracy, and Clinton pursued this goal on two
fronts: expansion of NATO in Europe and support of Boris Yeltsin in
Russia. When Clinton embarked on the jihad of making the world safe
for democracy, he not only embraced this aspect of Wilsonism but
capitulated to the arguments of Anthony Lake, his first national
security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Doctrine brought Poland, the Czech Republic and
Hungary into NATO. By including these three countries under the
NATO umbrella, the United States committed itself to the defense of
countries it never previously considered within its own sphere of
national self-interest. This enormous broadening of American
guarantees was justified under the principle of missionary
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In expanding NATO, Clinton broke American implied agreements
with Mikhail Gorbachev. ``A World Transformed,'' written by George
Bush, who was president at the time of the disintegration of the
Soviet Empire in Eastern Europe, and Brent Scowcroft, Bush's
national security adviser, is unequivocal on this point: At no time
did Bush, Scowcroft, or Secretary of State James Baker indicate to
Gorbachev that NATO would be extended eastward to Poland, the Czech
Republic and Hungary after the Soviets voluntarily renounced their
title to these tracts of land.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy toward Yeltsin was another case of missionary
democracy. The Clinton administration adamantly supported Yeltsin
on the grounds that he was leading the democratic capitalist
transformation of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   However, Yeltsin's resignation from office and the crowning of
Vladimir Putin as his successor is a serious setback for the
Clinton doctrine. Putin's recent alliance with the Communists
belies the assertion that democracy is functioning in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lee Hamilton, Democratic loyalist, respected former
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and current
director of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, Putin's recent coalition
with the Communists ``amounts to a defeat for Clinton, for it
strengthens the power of the Communists in the Duma.'' &QL; 
PUSHING MULTILATERALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another Wilson ideal that the Clinton doctrine continues is that
American diplomacy should unfold within multilateral institutions.
Liberal moralists are suspicious of unilateral actions because they
fear it will give rise to worldwide anti-Americanism.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the fact that recent ventures in which America
acted under the aegis of the United Nations _ such as in Somalia,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo _ all appear to be failures, the
White House still upholds the usefulness of multilateralism. The
Oval Office fears the bully backlash _ that other nations will
express their resentment against the paramountcy of the United
States by opposing American policies.
</P>
<P>
   Another principle of liberal moralism to which the Clinton
doctrine abides is free trade.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal moralism wishes to turn the movement toward economic
globalization to an advantage for the United States, and so Clinton
has devoted much effort to the reduction of tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wishes to use trade as a form of social engineering,
because he hopes that free trade will encourage the growth of a
capitalist entrepreneurial class in countries making the transition
out of communism, like China. Borrowing a phrase from his former
economic adviser, Andrea Tyson, Clinton thinks in terms of
``strategic trade,'' or trade with a deeper purpose than just
making a profit.
</P>
<P>
   In its approach to China, the Clinton doctrine combines the
strategic trade and the ``strategic partner'' approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The theory of the strategic partner is to detach China from any
``anti-hegemonist'' bloc alliance. Primarily, this means preventing
the re-creation of the Cold War Sino-Soviet coalition. &QL; 
OVAL OFFICE'S PLAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hook of strategic trade is associated with the universal
human-rights theory of Carter. By its use of strategic trade, the
Oval Office hopes to ensnare President Jiang Zemin into granting
more ``human rights'' to Chinese citizens. The ultimate aim of
trans-Pacific social engineering is to both speed the development
of a commercial middle class in China and to provide these
entrepreneurs with the protective shield of civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives of all camps attack the Clinton doctrine on China
as a contradiction between rewards and punishments.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting upon the differences that separate Republicans and
Democrats, Democratic loyalist Hamilton told ``The Arizona
Republic,'' ``Republicans are very skeptical of international
organizations, such as the U.N., the World Trade Organization and
the like. Democrats generally support these multilateral
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a monopolar world in the social and economic
sense. Even though the U.S. is the only superpower in the military
or `hard' sense, it cannot dictate to all nations of the globe in
matters of gender, children, values or culture. In terms of `soft'
power _ education, information and trade, this is a multipolar
world and the U.S. must learn to act in conjunction with
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to recognize that the most important lever of
diplomatic power has changed from `hard' to `soft' power. To me,
trade is the crucial issue.'' &QL; 
PARTY SPLIT ON POLICIES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans tend to stress military power,'' Hamilton
added. ``I am an unrepentant free-trader because I believe that
unrestricted trade, from which all sides benefit, is the best way
to export the democratic order.''
</P>
<P>
   But policies are divisive ones within the Democratic Party. To
hold the presidency again in November, Democrats desperately need
the support of American labor, and the AFL-CIO has already endorsed
Vice President Al Gore. Nevertheless, a divorce has taken place
between the corporatist and labor wings of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The corporatists favor strategic trade and China's entry into
the World Trade Organization, because they will be the ``winners''
from the globalization of trade, while Big Labor is opposed to
these policies, because they will be the ``losers'' when domestic
wages are repressed. The Seattle meeting of the World Trade
Organization ended in chaos when Big Labor and environmentalists
led street demonstrations demanding environmental protections, an
end to child labor in China and other Asian countries and
improvement of working conditions before any further reduction of
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   The issues of China and world trade will be hotly debated along
partisan lines when Congress is called on to approve China's entry
into the World Trade Organization in the fall, and they will play a
major role in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has already become a victim of the Democratic dependency on
Big Labor. Gore suffers from a split personality: one face as vice
president and the other as party candidate. As vice president, he
speaks in favor of the Clinton doctrine, but as candidate he must
massage the labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, Gore's divided personality made the front pages
when the AFL-CIO criticized him for placing the reduction of
tariffs before the increase of wages, the growth of labor unions
and the end of sweat shops in Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of Gore's problems with the labor unions, he is also a
Liberal Moralist. In the war of words currently waged in opinion
journals, Stephen M. Walt, a professor of international relations
at Harvard University, has acted as the vice president's script
writer. In an article in the March/April issue of ``Foreign
Affairs,'' Walt has written a Democratic response to the Republican
broadsides that were published by ``Foreign Affairs'' in the
previous issue. The vice president's proxy only proved that on
foreign affairs, Gore is a clone of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley is also a Liberal Moralist and although there are
no significant differences between Gore and Clinton, there are
important divisions between Gore-Clinton and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore-Clinton favor an increase in the defense budget, but
Bradley advocates a cut in appropriations for the Defense
Department. Bradley would use the money saved from the military
spending for his domestic agenda such as his health and
anti-poverty programs. Bradley is also far more attuned to the
growing gulf between the cyberspace Atlantic world and the
spinning-wheel Third World.  &QL; 
`BULLY BACKLASH' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Liberal realists, particularly professor Michael Mandelbaum of
the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, agrees
with Clinton-Gore that it is vital to work within multinational
organizations, but he dissents from the Clinton doctrine on the
issue that America should become a global proselytizer for
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelbaum led the charge against the expansion of NATO because
he feared the ``bully backlash.'' Mandelbaum's essay, ``Foreign
Policy as Social Work,'' appeared in the January/February 1996
issue of ``Foreign Affairs.'' In the essay, he criticized Clinton
for seeking to turn the United States into the messiah of
constitutional government.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelbaum wrote of Clinton and Lake, his first national
security adviser: ``They tried and failed to turn American foreign
policy into a branch of social work.''
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy, Mandelbaum and the entire liberal
realist camp argues, has overextended and overtaxed U.S. resources
around the world. The liberal realists oppose intervention in the
internal affairs of other sovereign states, and they reject the
notion that America can play the world's shrink, using the methods
of a social worker to aid the dysfunctional.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican or Democratic candidate in the current campaign
embraces isolationist or protectionist positions. As the new
century dawns, the United States is experiencing instant historical
replay. The First World War is over, the Treaty of Versailles is
written, and America in 2000 must decide whether it will sign the
League of Nations in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   All those who favor close collaboration with international
organizations, forgoing all instances of unilateral intervention,
will vote for Woodrow Wilson. All those who favor the retention of
full American self-interest, the need for unilateral intervention
to further national security, will vote for Lodge. But whatever
your vote, you must face the consequences: If Americans can put
aside their obsession with the marrying-a- multimillionaire
melodrama, they will bear in mind that history is a life-and-death
sentence, that it repeats itself, and the Second World War followed
the First.  &QL;

REPUBLICAN FOREIGN-POLICY PERSPECTIVES: MORALISTS VS. REALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORMAN LEVINE  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (ALSO MOVING IN ``K'' CATEGORY. / SECOND IN A SERIES OF THREE)
 &UR; The author examines the Republican ``Conservative Moralist'' and
 &UR; ``Conservative Realist'' positions in the debate over the
 &UR; direction of American foreign policy.)
</P>
<P>
   The Great Foreign Policy Debate of 2000 is a cascade of ink not
limited to the battle of the journals. It has become a bonanza as
well for the publishing industry as authors from different research
institutes flood bookstores and libraries with their tomes.
</P>
<P>
   The most prestigious outlet for discussions of international
affairs is the bimonthly magazine ``Foreign Affairs,'' which
specializes in the disputations of diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment
for Peace, and his intellectual soul mate, Bill Kristol, editor of
the ``Weekly Standard'' journal, co-wrote an article in ``Foreign
Affairs''called ``Toward a Neo-Reaganite Foreign Policy,'' in which
they wrote: ``Finally, American foreign policy should be informed
with a clear moral purpose, based on the understanding that its
moral goals and its fundamental national interest are almost in
harmony . . . The remoralization of America at home ultimately
requires the remoralization of American foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   `GREAT FATHER FIGURE' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``History shows that democracies do not fight each other,''
writes Robert Kagan, who may be considered the leading advocate of
the Conservative Moralist congregation. ``American democracy should
be expansionary, and the U.S. should be more assertive and activist
in enlarging the frontiers of democracy around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take Ronald Reagan as the great father figure of American
foreign policy. Not only was Reagan skeptical of international
organizations, but he also understood the necessity for the U.S. to
act unilaterally and to intervene into the affairs of another
country on the grounds of American national interest. Reagan had an
intuitive grasp of hard power, or military force.''
</P>
<P>
   REALISM AND MORALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kagan traces his intellectual ancestry to Teddy Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I join realism and moralism,'' Kagan said, ``and so did Teddy
Roosevelt. Woodrow Wilson, for all his genius, even though he
desired to make the `world safe for democracy,' was willing to
sacrifice American sovereignty to a world government.
</P>
<P>
   ``TR (Teddy Roosevelt) would not have done that, but recognized
the need to use U.S. power unilaterally to spread American ideas
and values. Reagan was part of the TR (Roosevelt) tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ledeen, research fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, has published a book, ``Freedom Betrayed,'' that reads
like a hymn to the American system.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ledeen, the democratic revolution has passed
through two periods: The first was the American Revolution of 1776,
and the second is America in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A proselytizing Democrat, Ledeen attaches himself to the Wilson
who sought to ``make the world safe for democracy,'' and ``Freedom
Betrayed'' presents the United States as a revolutionary power, a
``chosen nation'' for converting the world to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATIC IMPERIALISM? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The dogma of Conservative Moralists is open to theological
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Kagan, Kristol and Ledeen abandon the principles of George
Kennan's ``containment policy'' through which America won the Cold
War. The containment policy was essentially a static program, for
it conformed to a bipolar world, and it assumed that both the
Soviet Union and the United States would remain on their sides of
the Iron Curtain, while Washington waited for the decay of
Stalinist Communist imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   The priesthood of Conservative Moralism wants to replace the
static nature of the containment policy with a form of democratic
imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that the post-Cold War world is a monopolar one in which
the United State is preeminent, that limits to American
expansionism no longer exist, this College of Cardinals seeks to
root the democratic flag in such far-away places as Azerbaijan,
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan (countries that few Americans even know
are on the map) _ all of which, not incidentally, are enormously
rich in oil and natural-gas deposits.
</P>
<P>
   These foreign-policy gurus have not proved their claim that
unilateral intervention into the affairs of a sovereign country is
an effective means of installing democracy in a nation. Government
through the consent of the people arises only when other supportive
institutions exist, such as a free press, an independent judiciary
and a population committed to the principles of civil rights, and
these cannot be imposed by paratroopers descending from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRACY OR CAPITALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, the prophets of Conservative Moralism do not clearly
indicate which they wish to export _ democracy or capitalism.
Michael Ledeen, however, does have the courage of his faith, for he
wishes to export the Reagan Republican Platform of 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Freedom Betrayed,''Ledeen defines the democratic
revolution: ``Today it means waging war against the growing power
of the preeminent modern institution: state bureaucracy . . That is
why the call to slash the size of government is such an integral
part of the democratic revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a difference between the American Constitution and
the Republican platform of 1980: Although it is patriotism to ask
American soldiers to fight for the Constitution, it is bottomless
greed to ask them to fight to imperialize the Reagan 1980 campaign
slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Wishing to position itself as the final arbiter of the Great
Debate, ``Foreign Affairs'' has devoted its January-February 2000
issue to the Republican side of this argument. In this issue,
Condoleezza Rice wrote the lead article, ``Promoting the National
Interest,'' an exposition of the Conservative Realist position. In
the March/April 2000 issue, ``Foreign Affairs''will follow up with
the Democratic response.
</P>
<P>
   NATION COMES FIRST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rice has deep roots in the Bush dynasty because she worked as a
Russian specialist on the National Security Council under President
Bush and presidential adviser Brent Scowcroft. A book by Bush and
Scowcroft, ``A World Transformed,'' refers to her as extremely
competent and knowledgeable.
</P>
<P>
   Re-emphasizing one of the major principles of Conservative
Realism, Rice upholds the primacy of national interest over
international organizations and norms. The theory of ``universal
human rights'' is a wonderful ideal, but here also national
interest takes priority over the banner of universal human rights.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of Russia, Rice supports the expansion of NATO to
include Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. The United States
should not be deterred by Russian anger because of the ballooning
of NATO into real estate once controlled by Soviet armies.
</P>
<P>
   The former Soviet specialist to Bush favors U.S. support for the
continued independence of the Ukraine and other countries in
Central Asia that seek to protect their sovereignty from Russian
control.
</P>
<P>
   REBUILD MILITARY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Caspian Sea region is of vital importance for U.S. interests
because of its huge oil and natural-gas reserves. In this region of
the globe, the policy of containing the Soviet Union is replaced by
the policy of dismembering Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Criticizing President Clinton for cutting the defense budget,
Rice wants to rebuild the military to throw out the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Russians and construct a
national missile-defense system. The defeat of the renewal of the
1992 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was correct. In the last
analysis, it is ``hard power,'' the persuasiveness of the bullet,
that determines the fate of nations.
</P>
<P>
   Rice favors U.S. participation in all international
organizations because such collaboration is an advantage to the
national interests of America.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she favors continued U.S. participation in the
World Trade Organization, because she favors opening markets for
U.S. exports. Trade is an important instrument of U.S. foreign
policy, and the international reduction of tariffs and other trade
barriers represents a gain to the United States because it helps
create an entrepreneurial capitalist class in whatever nation
becomes a partner in these commercial networks.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding trade with China, the former national security adviser
believes, is in American national self-interest because it will
speed economic liberalization, and the emergence of an aggressive
capitalist phalanx could act as the springboard for the sprouting
of political democracy. Unlike Clinton, however, Rice does not view
China as a ``strategic partner'' but as a ``strategic competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Realists want to maintain Taiwanese
independence, and they image themselves as the party of the right
on the China issue. In essence, they want to create an East Asian
``rollback theory'' in the style of John Foster Dulles, keeping
China out of Taiwan and forcing China out of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   CEASE BEING WORLD'S POLICE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From her new position at Stanford University, Rice launched has
her most spirited diatribes against the Clinton administration on
the question of humanitarian intervention. She points to the
failure of such action in Haiti and to the ineffectiveness of
multilateral humanitarian intervention in Somalia,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the United States exerts hard hegemonic power in the
world, it should not act as the earth's ``globocop.'' Rice does not
believe that it is within the national interest of the United
States to play the universal gendarme.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Rice an authoritative voice from the Conservative
Realist pew, but the probable ghostwriter on foreign policy for
Gov. George W. Bush. There is no difference in substance between
the Rice essay and a speech on America's position in the world that
Bush gave to kick off his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Jeane Kirkpatrick, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under
Reagan, agrees with Rice, particularly on the need to protect U.S.
sovereignty and to build an anti-ballistic missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am glad the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was defeated,''
Kirkpatrick confessed. ``I worked for five years at the U.N., and I
can tell you that votes in the General Assembly are often stampeded
and ill-informed. There are over 150 members in the General
Assembly, and the vast majority have no experience with nuclear
weapons, and so their votes are not based on fact or experience. It
is wrong to give such a body a literal veto over American
armaments, defense and national interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall discussing the issue of the anti-ballistic missile
defense system with Ronald Reagan. The president looked upon a
system which could prevent an attack as a moral imperative because
it would prevent incalculable carnage. He believed that the policy
of MAD _ mutually assured destruction _ was immoral because it left
open the possibility of attack and cataclysmic bloodshed. To be
able to deter such an attack was equal to defending against
unprecedented inhumanity.''
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN BEEFS UP HIS TEAM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain is also a member of the Conservative Realist
choir.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, McCain has added some illustrious names to his
foreign-policy team. Other notable foreign-policy sages now stand
alongside Henry Kissinger in the ex-Navy pilot's camp, and they
include Zbigniew Brzezinski, Larry Eagleberger, Kirkpatrick and R.
James Woolsey.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-prisoner of war also looks suspiciously upon mainland
China. Although McCain supports the maintainence of normal trade
relations with China, he looks upon that country of 1.2 billion
people as a rival to the United State in the Pacific Rim, and he
stands firmly for continued independence of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The November election will undoubtedly witness impassioned
disagreements over China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
China already enjoys most-favored-nation trading rights with the
United States and a mushrooming trade surplus.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA AT CENTER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Judging China as a potential adversary, McCain wants to link
membership in the World Trade Organization with domestic
liberalization in China. Rather than remain in a state of Clinton
self-denial, Conservative Realists want China to broaden universal
rights, grant religious freedom and cease political repression
before granting it equal representation in the trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether Bush or McCain becomes the GOP
presidential contender, China will become the center of gravity of
the foreign-policy debates. For most of the 12 years that
Republicans held the White House, from 1980 to 1992 under Reagan
and George Bush, the Cold War raged and Republicans looked tougher
on the Soviet Union than Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Evil Empire'' has disappeared, the bipolar world is a
theme of the past, but the Republicans have also suffered their
losses: They can no longer appear as the knights of anti-communism.
To reinvent their image as Sir Lancelot slaying the Red Dragon,
they are trying to paint Beijing as the Second KGB. Abiding by the
philosophy of ``Wag the Dog,'' if a war does not exist, then it is
necessary to invent one.

 BIG 12 IS GOOD, BUT DON'T LOOK FOR IT IN FINAL
FOUR (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By WENDELL BARNHOUSE
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Here's a Vaunted Hoop Expert's early word of
NCAA Tournament advice for those of you planning to participate in
March Madness bracket pools: Don't pencil in a Big 12 Conference
team to reach the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   (Coaches and administrators around the league are now doing
handsprings and hive-fiving each other. Given the past track record
of this V.H.E., predicting that no Big 12 team will be playing in
Indianapolis a month from now virtually guarantees a Final Four
team for the Big 12.)
</P>
<P>
   Saying that the Big 12 doesn't have a team worthy of winning a
national championship or reaching the Final Four is not a rip. It's
more a realistic assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of good teams, but we don't have any great
teams,'' Oklahoma coach Kelvin Sampson said.
</P>
<P>
   And a lot of good teams has translated into a lot of good
basketball. The Big 12 this season has provided some of the most
exciting and intense games in the country. Games such as Texas at
Missouri, Oklahoma State at Oklahoma, Oklahoma at Kansas and Texas
at Iowa State have been as entertaining and watchable as anything
the Big Ten, the Pac-10 or the ACC is throwing down on a regular
basis.
</P>
<P>
   When the Big 12's top six teams _ Iowa State, Oklahoma State,
Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri _ have played each other this
season, the games have been NCAA Tournament quality. Some of the
offensive performances have been more worthy of a brickyard than a
court, but that's because no quarter is given.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think you're going to score points easily on anybody in
this league, you're in for a rude awakening,'' said Kansas coach
Roy Williams, whose team has survived basically because it ``sells
out'' defensively every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The top teams in this league, when they play, everybody brings
it,'' said Kansas senior forward Nick Bradford. ``And you better be
ready for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jayhawks found that out Monday night in Austin. Kansas is no
longer King of the Big 12. After winning 30 of its first 32 Big 12
games, Kansas is 21-10 the past two seasons. It's good for the Big
12 that it's no longer the Jayhawks and the 11 Dwarfs. The rest of
the Big 12 has caught up.
</P>
<P>
   You've got Rick Barnes trying to build a power in Austin, you've
got Sampson's every-possession intensity with the Sooners, you've
got Oklahoma State's Gray Fox, Eddie Sutton. Then there's young
guns such as Iowa State's Larry Eustachy and Missouri's Quin
Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   The Big 12 also is benefiting from stars such as Oklahoma
State's Desmond Mason and Oklahoma's Eduardo Najera, Texas' Chris
Mihm and Iowa State's Marcus Fizer. Mason and Najera are seniors;
Mihm and Fizer are juniors who face NBA early-entry decisions. Next
year, the Big 12 could be ``down,'' less competitive with fewer
stars.
</P>
<P>
   When the NCAA Tournament field is announced March 12, the Big 12
can expect to have five teams. Iowa State, Texas and Oklahoma State
have a shot at being seeded No. 4 or higher. That seeding will be
crucial if the Big 12 hopes for reasonable representation at the
Sweet 16 level.
</P>
<P>
   The league's top teams all have fatal flaws that are likely to
prevent a deep NCAA run. Iowa State lacks depth; Oklahoma State's
offense is limited by Doug Gottlieb's shooting woes; Texas needs
consistent guard play/outside shooting; Oklahoma's Najera might be
broken down after carrying a big load all season.
</P>
<P>
   The Big 12, in four seasons, has yet to produce a Final Four
team. If that trend continues, so be it. But for this season, at
least, the basketball has been worth savoring.

 OATES HELPED BY SULLIVAN (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) By T.R. SULLIVAN c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ When Johnny Oates was going through times
of deep personal distress, one man was always there for him.
</P>
<P>
   When he was fired in Baltimore and when his wife, Gloria, fell
ill in his first year in Texas, one man was right there when Oates
needed him.
</P>
<P>
   Sparky Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Johnny Oates was thrilled yesterday when the
veteran's committee selected Anderson for induction in baseball's
Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very deserving,'' Oates said. ``I have so much respect
for that man, I can't tell you what he means to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently a great deal, even though Oates never played for
Anderson, coached under him or worked in the same organization. On
the field, all Oates ever tried to do was beat him.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't stop Anderson from supporting Oates through some
of the roughest periods of his life, beginning in Baltimore when he
was under attack, both publicly and privately, from Orioles owner
Peter Angelos.
</P>
<P>
   ``He helped me through that period by telling me I was okay,''
Oates said. ``I needed somebody to tell me I was okay, what you're
doing is not wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one day after a game, he walked up to Gloria, put
his hands on her shoulders and said, honey, every time he tries to
put on one of those pity parties, tell him how fortunate he is.
Don't let him feel sorry for himself because he's going to be all
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates said the same thing happened in 1995 when his wife had to
be hospitalized and he had to take a two-week leave of absence to
be with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Gloria got sick, he called twice a day, morning and
afternoon,'' Oates said. ``This was in spring training when he was
battling the media because he had walked out of camp and refused to
work with replacement players. But he was still willing to call me
twice a day to see how she was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers third-base coach Jerry Narron is also a close friend of
Anderson's even though they never were on the same team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would always take the time to talk baseball with me,''
Narron said. ``A lot of guys of his stature aren't going to talk
with some first or second-year coach but he was always willing to
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates celebrated Anderson's election by telling two favorite
stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Henneman was in Detroit,'' Oates said. ``He had just
blown a save. He came into the clubhouse yelling, screaming and
throwing everything. So Sparky came out to the clubhouse and said,
Mike, I want to see you here tomorrow at 12 o'clock. You and I have
got something to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``So Mike met Sparky the next day. He had no idea what was going
to happen. Sparky took him over to the children's hospital there in
Detroit and took him into the terminal illness ward, where kids
have two or three weeks to live. Afterwards, they were walking out
and Sparky said, ``Hey Mike, a blown save is not so tough after
that, is it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Oates said Anderson had a unique way of getting his point
across.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another time in Detroit, a pitcher _ I'm not going to say who
it was _ hit Rob Deer in the elbow,'' Oates said. ``Hit him on
purpose. Deer, who's a big guy, was hurt and as he goes to first
base, the pitcher is still yelling at him. So Sparky's afraid that
Deer is going to charge the mound if this pitcher keeps yelling at
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``So he goes from the third-base dugout in Detroit to first base
to make sure Deer is all right. Then, as he walks back to the
dugout, he goes by the mound and said real quietly to the pitcher,
if you really want to get it on with that big guy over there, I'll
go over there and ask him to meet you right here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid didn't know what to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Oates, ``He won a lot of games but he also influenced a lot
of people. Some of them don't even know it. I tried to thank him
once, but he wouldn't let me. He said, I'm just doing my job.''

 DRANSFELDT TO SPEND YEAR IN MINORS (For
use by NYTimes News Service clients) By T.R. SULLIVAN c.2000 Fort
Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Second base could be the most intriguing
position in Rangers camp this spring. Luis Alicea is the starter,
but the Rangers will take a good look at Frank Catalanotto, Edwin
Diaz, Jorge Diaz and Scott Sheldon.
</P>
<P>
   Left out of the mix, both as a potential starter or backup, is
Kelly Dransfeldt. The Rangers prefer to let Dransfeldt spend the
season at Triple-A Oklahoma trying to regain his stature as one of
the Rangers' top minor-league prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``He recognizes he needs a lot of work with his bat,'' Rangers
general manager Doug Melvin said. ``Even if he has a good spring,
he needs to take those at-bats somewhere and use them on a regular
basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Dransfeldt was last seen in Arlington in May, when he filled in
while shortstop Royce Clayton was on the disabled list. The Rangers
liked what they saw on defensive, but he hit only .189 in 16 games.
He then went back to Oklahoma and batted .218 the rest of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were hoping he would recover with a strong
winter-league season in Puerto Rico, but he hit only .163 in 13
games for Bayamon before returning home in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough down there,'' Dransfeldt said. ``We had a lot of
rain and played 10 games in 40 days. We had a hurricane. Then I got
food poisoning and I was in the hospital and lost a lot of weight.
That's when I decided to go home. It was a bad experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Dransfeldt can play all three infield positions, but Melvin
doesn't see him making the team as a utility player. He'd rather
see Dransfeldt go back to Oklahoma and play every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't look at him as a part-time player,'' Melvin said.
``Down the road he may be that, but we don't think so. He's got a
chance to be a front-line shortstop.''
Contract deadline coming Pitcher Ryan Glynn agreed to a new
contract yesterday worth $205,000 and Catalanotto signed for
$305,000, leaving six players unsigned: outfielder Ruben Mateo and
pitchers Jeff Zimmerman, Francisco Cordero, Dan Kolb, Mike Venafro
and Matt Perisho.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers want them signed before their first exhibition game
Friday. Under the Basic Agreement, any player with less than three
years experience who is not signed can have his contract
automatically renewed by the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be one renewal, but there doesn't seem to be any
problems,'' Rangers general manager Doug Melvin said. ``We'll get
it done before the games start.''
DH watch Manager Johnny Oates could have some interesting choices
for designated hitter when a left-handed pitcher is on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Left-handed hitter Lee Stevens is a lifetime .241 hitter against
left-handed pitchers but hit .304 against them last year. Oates
also has two attractive right-handed hitters, Chad Curtis and Mike
Simms.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis was used primarily against left-handers by the Yankees
last year and hit .297 off them, matching his career average.
Simms, who hit .296 with 16 homers in 186 at-bats in 1998, was
supposed to platoon with Stevens last year until he injured his
left Achilles tendon and missed most of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Oates said he's not sure if Curtis or Simms will make the team,
or if Stevens will sit against left-handers. Simms could be traded
before the spring is over if the Rangers have another need on the
bench besides a right-handed power hitter.

 FLYERS LIMP INTO TOWN (For use by NYTimes
News Service clients) By JEFF CAPLAN c.2000 Fort Worth
Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Philadelphia Flyers come to town with an
injury list close to, if not, as formidable as any the Stars have
fashioned this season.
</P>
<P>
   Stars you won't find on the ice for the Flyers tonight: captain
Eric Lindros (back), center Keith Primeau (rib), 18-year veteran
defenseman Ulf Samuelson (left rotator cuff) and defensemen Dan
McGillis (groin) and Luke Richardson (right collarbone).
</P>
<P>
   The Stars point of view: tsk, tsk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, there's no sympathy from this camp for teams that
come in and have a few injuries,'' coach Ken Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   These two teams deadlocked 1-1 in their only other meeting of
the season in Philadelphia. The injuries definitely softens the
anticipation of on-ice matchups. Stars defensemen Derian Hatcher
(6-5, 230) and Richard Matvichuk (6-2, 215) trading paint with
Lindros (6-4, 236) and company is as anticipated a matchup as any.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I don't know if I look too forward to it to be honest,''
Hatcher said. ``When you know you're playing against him 25
minutes, you have to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars get the Flyers on the tail-end of back-to-back road
games. The Flyers faced the Blues in St. Louis last night.
Thornton fitting in
</P>
<P>
   In the past five games, Scott Thornton has scored two goals and
chalked up an assist. Putting pucks in the net had seemed like a
lost art to Thornton in Montreal. Two in five games might not seem
like much, but consider he is one-fifth of the way to his
career-high of 10 in 11 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to get your hands above your head for a change,''
Thornton said.
Langenbrunner plays with pain
</P>
<P>
   Each game, Jamie Langenbrunner plays with a sore neck stemming
from a nagging pinched nerve. The forward has missed 14 total games
because of it. Tonight will be his third game back after missing
three games with soreness.
</P>
<P>
   He endured a crosscheck to the back late in Friday's game
against Chicago that sent him to the ice face-first and kept him
there a few minutes, sending team trainer Dave Surprenant to his
aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult, it wasn't that hard of a hit that got me, so
that was frustrating,'' Langenbrunner said. ``It's more the
irritation in it right now that's causing the problems. It's there
pretty much all the time. You just deal with it.''
Lukowich swaps stick
</P>
<P>
   Rookie defenseman-turned-forward Brad Lukowich traded in his
thicker hockey stick for a slimmed-down, graphite model.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm using \RMike\S Modano's pattern now. It's the exact same
stick, it's unbelievable,'' said Lukowich, who is taking a crash
course in learning how to play forward. He only chuckled when logic
suggested he will now score like Mike, too.
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull did not skate for a third consecutive day due to a
hip flexor, a nonserious injury that won't go away, Hitchcock said.
Hull is not expected to miss any games. Hull has earned points in
six consecutive games (2-6-8) going back to Feb. 18 at Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hitchcock said center Joe Nieuwendyk (separated right
shoulder) Jan. 19 could return in 10 to 14 days.

MISS USA PAGEANT CROWNS GARY, IND., WITH A 3-YEAR CONTRACT 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mo., La., Ill., N.H.)   By DANIEL J. YOVICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARY, Ind. _ Better known for violence, rust and urban decay
than as a destination for beautiful women wearing sequins and gold
lame, Gary, Ind., an aging, gritty city east of Chicago, entered a
contract Tuesday to be the site of the nationally televised Miss
USA Pageant.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement that the pageant would be held here for three
years starting in February 2001 was seized on as another sign of
hope by a town sometimes known to its detractors as ``Scary Gary.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven days ago, Mayor Scott King signed an agreement to bring a
Continental Basketball Association team, Steelheads, here beginning
in November. Two months earlier, Pan American Airlines began daily
service to Orlando and Portsmouth, N.H., from the Gary/Chicago
Airport, which for years did not provide commercial flights. Gary
is negotiating with minor league baseball officials to bring a team
here in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The turnaround is occurring as Gary, a city of 114,256 that
Money magazine in 1998 named the most dangerous city in the United
States, is making inroads against crime. In 1993, 1995 and 1996,
Gary tallied more homicides per capita than any other American
city.
</P>
<P>
   Homicide is down 24 percent from 1997 through 1999, from 98 to
74 killings. For the same period, rape fell 81 percent, armed
robbery decreased 24 percent and aggravated battery declined 62
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among those killed last year was the mayor's 17-year-old nephew,
shot after a fistfight with another youth. Nonetheless, the mayor
is encouraged by the drop in crime, and is quick to attribute much
of the decline to an FBI-led anti-gang unit sent in 1997 by
Attorney General Janet Reno. The unit has made more than 500
arrests and federal prosecutors have won more than 200 convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gary has become safer, it has not become much prettier.
</P>
<P>
   The main thoroughfare, Broadway, is 45 blocks of mostly
abandoned buildings and boarded-up storefronts. Nearly three
downtown blocks are vacant, the result of a fire in 1996 that
leveled churches, stores and an auditorium. Wide swaths of the
city's housing is abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   But King, two months into his second four-year term, said he
believed Gary was about to rebound from the hard times wrought by
the 1980s recession in the steel industry that left thousands here
without jobs and the crime wave wrought by street gangs in 1990s
fighting for control of the crack trade.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in Gary, 8.2 percent at the end of 1999, is still
well above the state average of 3.2 percent, but less than half of
the high of 17.8 percent in 1989. ``We've built a solid
foundation,'' King said. ``Now we need to put up the framing.''
</P>
<P>
   Maureen J. Reidy, the president of the Miss Universe
Organization, which produces the Miss USA pageant, said Gary's past
troubles had no impact on selecting it over 11 other cities _
including Branson, Mo., and Shreveport, La. _ to play host to the
pageant. Reidy, who was at King's side during a news conference
Tuesday, said she was ``pleasantly surprised'' by what she saw in
the city.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gary offered the best financial package _ the city will
pay $1.2 million in travel, lodging, and other pageant costs _ it
was not solely money that helped tip the scales in Gary's favor.
Donald Trump owns one of the city's two casinos. The Miss Universe
Organization is co-owned by Trump and CBS, which broadcasts the
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much is going on here,'' Reidy said.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said they did not know how much money the pageant
might attract. It may be hard to persuade those who know Gary only
from its violent image to visit, said Spero Batistatos, the
president of the Convention and Visitors Bureau of Lake County,
which includes Gary.
</P>
<P>
   Though the pageant will be held in the city's 6,000-seat Genesis
Convention Center, pageant workers and visitors probably will stay
in hotels up to an hour's drive away because Gary has only one
200-room hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some bumps along the way,'' Batistatos said.
``You're talking about a solid 30 years of brainwashing by the
media about the negatives in the city. A lot of those negatives are
gone. As good as this is, it's going to take some time to change
those perceptions.''

 HOCKEY-FIGHTING SITES GLORIFY DONNYBROOKS,
NOT MCSORLEY (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By TOMMY
CUMMINGS c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ It's an online community that spans North
America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   They post images of bloodied NHL players. They collect and trade
video and audio of memorable fights. They rank the best goons
and/or enforcers. They list the penalty-minutes leaders. They
huddle on message boards to review the latest knock-down-drag-out.
</P>
<P>
   They seem to do everything but collect broken teeth of famous
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite their passion for a good drop-the-gloves donnybrook,
these creators of hockey fight sites all abhor the recent incident
involving Marty McSorley, the Boston Bruins defenseman who was
handed the stiffest on-ice-related suspension in NHL history.
</P>
<P>
   In the closing seconds of Vancouver's 5-2 victory on Feb. 22,
McSorley used his stick to slash the Canucks' Donald Brashear on
his right temple.
</P>
<P>
   That, online fight fans contend, is not in the spirit of their
tributes to fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like two guys consenting to dropping the gloves and
throwing punches,'' said Marc Nagy, a St. Catharines, Ontario
resident and creator of Zero Reality (zeroreality.com), a site that
sells fight tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheap shots like this have nothing to do with fighting, and
have no place within the game of hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Jill Johnson of St. Louis authors The Penalty Box
(welcome.to/thepenaltybox), which tracks penalty-minute leaders.
``Of course, the people who read my site are mostly fight fans, but
they are not fans of what McSorley did,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Petti, a resident of Nova Scotia, ranks the all-time best
hockey fighters on his site (www.hockeyfighters.8m.com). He said
the McSorley incident is an ``argument for hockey fighting, not
against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a stick-swinging incident,'' Petti said. ``They were
not fighting at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Neall Alden, an Edmondton, Alberta resident who authors
Knuckles, Blood and Ice! (www.angelfire.com/ca/hockeyfights) said
fighting is not to blame for McSorley's outburst.
</P>
<P>
   ``McSorley broke the code _ the fighter's code that he lived by
all of his career,'' Alden said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Piaker, a student at New York University who has
animated graphics of fighting hockey players at his Mike's Hockey
Fight Homepage (members.aol.com/MarkMess11), said McSorley's
actions were stupid and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``However _ and I want to make myself clear that I am not
blaming the victim _ if Donald Brashear had dropped the gloves with
McSorley I don't think this incident would have happened,'' Piaker
said.
</P>
<P>
   B.B. Lynn of Memphis, Tenn., follows hockey fights in a section
called Fight Card at Inthecrease.com, an e-zine about professional
and amateur hockey. McSorley simply snapped, Lynn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If fighting were to be banned in hockey, you would begin to
see more incidents like this one,'' Lynn said.
Bytes Chat highlights: St. John's men's basketball coach Mike
Jarvis is scheduled to tip off the first in a series of chats that

INHERITING THE WORLD: AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY AFTER THE COLD

 c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic  
 ALSO MOVING IN THE ``K'' CATEGORY 
 RETRANSMITTING INHERITING-1, INHERITING-2 and INHERITING-3 FOR
 THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE MISSED THIS SPECIAL PACKAGE BY NORMAN
 LEVINE 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past hundred years, the United States has had three great
debates over foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   From 1914 to 1917, President Wilson led the country into World
War I to make the globe ``safe for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1947 to 1949, America mobilized against Soviet communism,
and George F. Kennan devised the ``containment policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the nation prepares to select its first president of the
21st century, it has entered its third great debate, and the
question, baldly put, is this: Now that we have inherited the
world, how shall we rule it?
</P>
<P>
   What is at stake in the outcome of this debate is nothing less
than the peace and prosperity of all Americans in the coming
century. Fortunately, America is at peace at the moment, but with
the demise of the Soviet Union as the second-greatest superpower,
many areas of instability and threat have surfaced on international
waters. Terrorism, the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons to rogue states such as Iraq, Iran and North
Korea, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism have brought a series of
mortal challenges to America's doorstep. The United States must
redefine its global role once again, for that act of
self-definition is vital to the security of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, it is only every four years, at the time of the
presidential election, that Americans come to face these
life-and-death issues for themselves and for their children.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions in which this discussion takes place are uniquely
different from the 1914-17 and 1947-49 periods. Today, because of
its victory over Politburo totalitarianism, the United States
stands alone as the Earth's only superpower.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War consensus, based on a bipolar standoff between the
United States and the Soviet Union, has imploded, and in the place
of this consensus a bewildering diversity of opinions has emerged
from the Washington foreign policy elites on how to manage Pax
Americana.
</P>
<P>
   These voices can be grouped into four categories, two
conservative and two liberal.
</P>
<P>
   On the right, the two camps are the Conservative Moralists and
the Conservative Realists. On the left, the two camps are the
Liberal Moralists and the Liberal Realists.
</P>
<P>
   The Dupont Circle area in Washington, D.C., is the miracle mile
of the foreign policy research establishment. Within the 20036 ZIP
code, it is only a five-minute walk among the Johns Hopkins School
of Advanced International Studies (Madeleine Albright's alma
mater), the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the
American Enterprise Institute. This is contested turf, a brutal
scrimmage line, for this ZIP code is a kind of foreign policy
football field in which Republican and Democratic advocates block
and tackle fiercely.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed Establishment casual, comfortable in a blue woolen
sweater, Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, told ``The Arizona Republic'' in January,
``The United States must be more assertive in advancing the
enlargement of democracy around the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and fellow conservative Bill Kristol, editor of the
influential journal the ``Weekly Standard,'' coined the phrase
``benevolent American hegemony'' as a flashcard for their views on
U.S. foreign policy. (``Hegemony'' is code for ``we're in
charge.'')
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and Kristol are the leading exponents of what we will call
the school of Conservative Moralists. A deep strain of moralism
runs through their thinking, because they are unflinching in their
belief that democracy should be the universal form of government,
and they do not shy away from the fact that it may be necessary to
intervene in the affairs of other sovereign states if that is
necessary to bring them the American idea of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   A DAPTING WILSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even though Kagan denies it, the Conservative Moralists are
indebted to the idealism of Woodrow Wilson. One part of Wilsonian
thought was to convince the world of the superiority of democracy,
and this is the part that Kagan and Kristol follow. Another part of
Wilson's thought was the belief that national interests should be
sacrificed to a League of Nations, and both Kagan and Kristol
reject this part.
</P>
<P>
   The school of Conservative Realists, whose most distinguished
practitioner is Henry Kissinger, rejects the moralism of Kagan and
Kristol. All the members of the realist school acknowledge that
democracy is the most desirable form of government, but they deny
that the United States has the missionary purpose of converting the
entire planet to democracy. For this camp, the proper end of
American diplomacy is the preservation of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger and like-minded policymakers are realists in the sense
that they see the world as made up of competing, self-interested
nations. For them, diplomacy is a jungle. In the spirit of Ronald
Reagan, this group is skeptical about international organizations,
although they see their usefulness. They also draw a line in the
sand between internationalism and the preservation of national
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Realism is a doctrine that favors unilateral action
to defend the national self-interest of the United States. It
doubts the effectiveness of multilateral action _ for example, the
U.N. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, which is widely acknowledged
to be a failure. The members of this school argue that the
multinational United Nations never has demonstrated its ability to
efficiently carry out its peacekeeping responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Straight and elegant, her mind as sharp as a quarterback in a
fourth-and-one-situation, Jeane Kirkpatrick, ambassador to the
United Nations under Ronald Reagan and now a professor at
Georgetown University and senior fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, disagrees with the Kagan-Kristol School. A strong voice
within the conservative movement, Kirkpatrick doubts that democracy
can be spread through interventionist methods.
</P>
<P>
   REAGAN'S WAY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald Reagan, whom I admired as a great president,''
Kirkpatrick said, ``understood the sanctity of national
independence. The U.N. is a useful tool. All international
organizations are useful tools. I am not opposed to the U.N. But
one principle that Reagan stood by, and that I stand by, is that
the U.S. must never surrender its sovereignty or national
self-interests to any international organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign policy agenda of the Republican Party is made up of
both Conservative Moralists and Realists. Gov. George W. Bush
himself stands squarely in the faction of Conservative Realism.
Many members of the realist school, including Condoleezza (EDITORS:
CORRECT) Rice, Elliot Abrams, Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz
(EDITORS: CORRECT) (all of whom held high foreign policy positions
in either the Reagan or Bush administrations), are currently
advisers to the present Bush presidential campaign. John McCain is
also a Conservative Realist, and one of his foreign policy advisers
is Henry Kissinger. Neither the Conservative Moralists nor Realists
are isolationists.
</P>
<P>
   The liberal Establishment also fields a team within the 20036
ZIP-code playing field, and the expertise of the Brookings
Institute is certainly playoff quality. Although it is primarily a
research center for scholars from all over the world, and as such
its public image must be as objective, the Woodrow Wilson Center,
yards away from the Dupont Circle, currently is headed by Lee
Hamilton, who presented to ``The Republic'' the arguments of the
Liberal Moralists.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat and former member of Congress, Hamilton was chairman
of the House Foreign Relations Committee. Stately, and possessed of
a typical Hoosier friendliness, Hamilton said, ``The Republicans
are too quick to defend unilateral intervention. Even though
international organizations are imperfect, America must learn to
work in cooperation with them.''
</P>
<P>
   CARTER LEGACY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The political heritage of the Liberal Moralists grows out of the
unusual alliance among Wilson, Jimmy Carter and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   From Wilson, the Liberal Moralists take the ideas of the
dissemination of democracy, as well as a commitment to collective
security and internationalism. From Jimmy Carter, they borrow the
dogma of universal human rights, which includes the rights of
women, children and labor.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Vietnam served as a bloody lesson that the arrogant,
unilateral exercise of U.S. power can produce the diplomatic
isolation of the United States. Like the Conservative Moralists,
Liberal Moralists also advocate an expansive role for democracy and
the capitalist system. Unlike both the Conservative Moralists and
Realists, the Liberal Moralists are suspicious of unilateral
intervention as a means of disseminating democracy and human
rights. Liberal Moralists prefer to act within multilateral
institutions, such as the United Nations. For example, Liberal
Moralists favor humanitarian intervention under the umbrella of the
United Nations. The American involvement in Kosovo is presented as
a model of humanitarian intervention, for in this case the United
States became engaged to prevent the continued slaughter of
Kosovars, but under the aegis of the multilateral United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that globalization was one of the dominant
tendencies of the last decade of the 20th century, Liberal
Moralists are free-traders. A large corporatist faction exists
within Liberal Moralists, because multinational corporations see
the opportunity to harvest huge profits from the
internationalization of trade.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Realists speak the language of national self-interest
and not the tongue of democratic moralism. Like the Conservative
Realists, their brethren the Liberal Realists take a dim view of
the idea that the purpose of American diplomacy is the conversion
of the globe to democracy. They also view the goal of international
relations as the preservation of American nationhood.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their conservative brethren, however, Liberal Realists
perceive contemporary international relations as multipolar. They
stress the importance of the United States' working in harmony with
multilateral organizations because they see the danger of causing a
reaction against the American imperium. If the United States were
to pursue a unilateralist course of action, the Liberal Realists
argue, this would result in the undesirable development of an
``anti-hegemonist'' camp _ the alliance of Russia, China and Iran
to halt American primacy.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON OPPOSED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent members of the Liberal Realist camp are three
academicians: Professors Michael Mandelbaum and Robert W. Tucker
(emeritus) of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International
Studies and Professor Ronald Steel of the University of
California-Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   True to their belief that America must show great restraint
before exercising unilateral action, the Liberal Realists opposed
the Clinton policy of NATO expansion. Mandelbaum's book ``The Dawn
of Peace in Europe'' is the classic statement against the need for
NATO enlargement on the grounds that it would drive Russia and
China together. Tucker's book ``The Imperialist Temptation''
criticized President Bush's Operation Desert Storm because it
represented U.S. overreach, extending U.S. responsibilities from
Western Europe, the original site of the American-Soviet standoff,
to the Persian Gulf, a colossal stretch of American national
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy is an outgrowth of Liberal Moralism.
Although there are significant differences in terms of their
foreign policy, both Al Gore and Bill Bradley are members of the
Liberal Moralist wing of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The grand foreign policy debate of the new millennium, the
search for the Second Coming of George F. Kennan, is essentially an
in-house dialogue among inhabitants of the Washington policy think
tanks. During the Kosovo entanglement the American people were
activated by TV war imagery to think about America's role in the
world, but Kosovo is over, and Americans again have turned their
gaze inward. It is Social Security, medical insurance, education
and taxes that consume their interest in this election year and not
``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   As Norman Ornstein, a specialist on Congress at the American
Enterprise Institute, pointed out, ``63 percent of the House of
Representatives were elected after the fall of communism.'' The
amount of money spent on agencies in the U.S. government dealing
with foreign affairs has been cut by Congress. The amount of money
given to international organizations also has been diminished. It
is truly a new world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that Congress is isolationist,'' Ornstein suggested,
``it is rather that Congress is insular. Domestic needs have taken
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is a terrorist act of great bestiality, unless the
TV screen can show decapitated bodies and mangled limbs, Americans
will elect their first chief executive of the new century on issues
relating to homosexuality and abortion rather than on this
transformative moment of how the U.S. colossus should behave in the
world after it inherited this wondrous sphere.  &QL;

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Hours before the polls closed in Tuesday's
nonbinding Democratic primary in Washington state, former Sen. Bill
Bradley announced that he would buy five minutes of prime time on
national television Thursday evening to make a direct appeal to
voters five days before the crucial Super Tuesday primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's aides said the taped spot, which will be broadcast at
the end of CBS News' ``48 Hours,'' would feature Bradley talking
about why he would make the best president of the four major
candidates now running.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign's decision to take the extraordinary step of buying
national television time reflects not only Bradley's difficult
straits _ he is running well behind Vice President Al Gore in
almost all state polls _ but also his frustration with the meager
amount of media attention he has been receiving. News coverage of
the presidential race has been dominated by the Republican battle
between Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's spot will be competing with ``E.R.'' on NBC, one of
television's most popular programs. Asked why they had not bought
time on ``E.R.'' instead, Bradley's aides said that it was probably
too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign declined to say how much the spot would
cost. But several political consultants who buy television time for
candidates estimated that it would be about $1 million. They also
estimated that the commercial would be seen by more than 7 million
people, though many would be in states that do not vote next
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen states, including California, New York, Missouri, Ohio,
Georgia and most of New England, hold Democratic primaries or
caucuses on March 7, when nearly a third of the delegates to the
Democratic national convention will be selected.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Carrick, a Democratic political consultant in California
who is not involved in the race, said the last time he could recall
a Democratic presidential candidate buying so much television time
during the primaries was when Sen. Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts
purchased 30 minutes on New England stations after he lost the Iowa
caucuses in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley does better when he can talk to voters in a
conversational setting where he tries to tell them what he's all
about,'' Carrick said. ``I think this is a smart decision to try to
get voters to tune in and pay attention and get a clear,
unchallenged version of his message.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's aides strenuously denied rumors that swept through
Washington, D.C., on Tuesday that Bradley would drop out of the
race if he failed to win in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This camp is working hard towards March 7 and beyond,'' said
Douglas C. Berman, Bradley's campaign chairman. ``I know everybody
wants to write a different story. But the velocity with which
things change in this political climate is incredible. And that's
the view of the campaign, and certainly the senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley campaigned in California on Tuesday after having spent
six days in Washington, where his aides had hoped a strong showing
would resuscitate his flagging campaign. He opened his day at a San
Francisco hospital where he spoke about the need for stronger
gun-control restrictions. He has proposed licensing all handgun
owners, registering all handguns and banning inexpensive handguns
known as Saturday Night Specials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are threatened from within by handguns,'' Bradley told
about 80 hospital workers. ``They are a threat to the most basic
parts of our lives, those things we take most for granted, like
going to school in the morning, or walking down a neighborhood
street.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he had been scheduled to return to San Francisco after a
debate with Gore in Los Angeles on Wednesday night, Bradley's
campaign said he would be returning instead to New York, where some
of his top supporters have sharply questioned his decision to focus
on Washington for the last week.

WITH COMPANY SALE, HONK KONG SHEDS ANOTHER VESTIGE OF COLONIAL
PAST

<P>
   HONG KONG _ The last British governor sailed out of this teeming
Asian port in 1997. And Tuesday, with the decision of Cable and
Wireless P.L.C. to sell its Hong Kong telephone company to a local
Internet start-up, Hong Kong has thrown off another vestige of its
colonial past.
</P>
<P>
   But while Cable and Wireless HKT is passing out of British
hands, it will still be firmly part of the local establishment. The
company is being bought by Pacific Century CyberWorks, a
nine-month-old company founded by Richard Li, an heir to the most
powerful family dynasty in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The seeming ease with which Li snatched Cable and Wireless HKT _
despite his company's small size and meager assets, and despite a
formidable counterbid by the much larger Singapore
Telecommunications _ has troubled some people here. They say it
smacks of the kind of favoritism and old-boy cronyism that
characterized business in Hong Kong during 154 years of colonial
rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the free-market city that people always talk
about,'' said Michael DeGolyer, director of an academic project
that surveys public attitudes about Hong Kong's return to China.
``Politics and personal ties have always ruled in Hong Kong.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no hard evidence that Li's political connections were
the decisive factor in his victory over Singapore
Telecommunications. The Hong Kong government said Tuesday that it
had not interfered in the process.
</P>
<P>
   But the chairman of Cable and Wireless, Graham Wallace,
acknowledged that Li's family ties were attractive. And another
executive close to the company said it had been eager to find a
``local solution'' to the sale of its Hong Kong operation.
</P>
<P>
   There is hardly a more ``local'' choice than Richard Li. His
father, Li Ka-shing, is perhaps Hong Kong's most successful tycoon.
He also has sterling connections in mainland China. With Pacific
Century's takeover of Cable and Wireless HKT, the Li family will
control companies that account for more than a third of the total
market capitalization of the Hong Kong stock market.
</P>
<P>
   On the day that Asia's largest-ever takeover battle ended,
executives close to Singapore Telecommunications complained that
their company was a victim of politics. They said the Singapore
company's bid was comparable to Pacific Century's offer, and they
pointed to its strategic partnership with Rupert Murdoch's News
Corp. Nevertheless, Cable and Wireless went with a local favorite _
and a financially shaky one at that.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore Telecom's outsider status was compounded by its
ownership. It is 79 percent owned by Temasek Holdings, the
investment arm of the Singapore government. Its chief executive is
Lee Hsien Yang, the 42-year-old son of the founder of modern
Singapore, Lee Kwan Yew. Executives close to Singapore Telecom said
those facts weighed against it with Hong Kong and mainland Chinese
authorities. They said this opposition was relayed to the Cable and
Wireless board by Hong Kong business executives with ties to
individual directors.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's antipathy toward Singapore Telecommunications may
partly originate from its own sense of insecurity. Singapore has
been a perennial rival of Hong Kong for the title of Asian
financial center _ a competition that has intensified in the last
two years as Singapore has liberalized its financial markets. Hong
Kong, by contrast, is still climbing out of a deep recession, and
it has drawn criticism for government intervention in its stock and
property markets.
</P>
<P>
   Given that situation, some officials here were unnerved by the
prospect of the Singapore government's taking over the local phone
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The telephone company is a strategic asset in any country,''
said Sin Chung-kai, a Hong Kong legislator. ``I think it would be a
matter of concern if the Singaporean government indirectly owned
the Hong Kong phone company.''
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's role in this corporate drama is murkier. Executives
close to Singapore Telecommunications said Chinese officials had
initially expressed concern about the proposal. Shortly after news
of the talks emerged, Wenhui Bao, a Beijing-controlled newspaper,
noted, ``If Cable and Wireless intends to sell its stake, there are
quite a few consortia in Hong Kong strong enough to buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, though, officials from Singapore Telecom's adviser,
Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., sounded out mainland officials, who signaled
they would not hold up a merger.
</P>
<P>
   Still, China's proxies made their preference for Pacific Century
clear. Newspapers here reported that China Telecom, the Hong
Kong-based arm of China's state telephone monopoly, favored Li's
offer for the company. China Telecom owns 10.7 percent of Cable and
Wireless HKT, a stake that will convert to a holding of less than 5
percent in the combined Pacific Century-HKT.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is a great accepter of what it calls problems left over
from history,'' said an analyst here, who asked not to be
identified because his firm was involved in the deal. ``But if the
status quo is going to change, I suspect they would try to exercise
some influence on how that happens.''

 HONG KONG: that happens. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It would have been hard for Hong Kong's authorities to block a
deal between Cable and Wireless and Singapore Telecommunications
outright. But it had other ways to exert pressure. The sale, for
example, must be ratified by the board of Cable and Wireless HKT,
which is composed of Hong Kong business people. That vote is now a
formality, but it might not have been so, had Singapore Telecom
prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Pacific Century dismissed suggestions that the
process had been rigged. ``I wouldn't think so,'' said Francis
Yuen, the deputy chairman. ``We certainly didn't feel that we were
favored in our negotiations with Merrill Lynch and Greenhill,'' he
added, referring to Cable and Wireless' advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Yuen said Pacific Century pursued HKT because it felt the
company's assets, like its high-capacity phone lines, would
complement its nascent Internet-access service. He said the
acquisition would accelerate the deployment of Pacific Century's
broadband service.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore Telecommunications, Yuen said, based its initial
proposal on the cost savings it could squeeze out of Cable and
Wireless HKT by combining operations. He said Singapore Telecom
would have brought little strategic direction to its Hong Kong
counterpart because it operates in a sheltered market that had only
recently been deregulated. Cable and Wireless HKT has had to
contend with competition for years _ a challenge that he said had
sharpened that company's management.
</P>
<P>
   For Pacific Century, however, the more pressing challenge will
be preserving the value of its bid. The company made two offers
that value Cable and Wireless HKT at $35.9 billion and $38.1
billion, respectively. The larger bid is in the form of stock,
while the smaller one offers stock and cash. But both rely heavily
on Pacific Century's stock, which has risen to stratospheric levels
in the last nine months.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said the shares, in which trading has been halted
since last Friday because of pending news, were likely to fall, now
that details of its offer are known. Pacific Century's stock may
also deflate somewhat as investors begin to value it according to
the realities of the local phone business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment these companies are detached from the cyberworld
and put into the real world, they are valued according to the real
world,'' said Marc Faber, who heads an investment firm here.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview Tuesday, Li said that he was confident
Pacific Century could inject Internet magic into Cable and Wireless
HKT's utilitylike phone business. ``I think it's a good transaction
for both parties,'' he said. ``An old pipe is only valuable if you
create new value.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, Li's remarkable victory proves mostly the value
of good connections.

CHECHNYA CAPTIVE TELLS OF BEATINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ More than a month after he disappeared, Andrei
Babitsky, a Radio Liberty reporter, returned to Moscow Tuesday, and
said he had been held in a Russian camp for detainees outside
Chechnya, where he said he and others were routinely beaten.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Babitsky has spurred concerns about press freedom in
Russia. Before his arrest, Russian authorities were angry about
Babitsky's reporting from Chechnya. Russian troops detained him as
he left Grozny, the Chechen capital, on Jan. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky then went through a strange sequence of events, in
which he was held incommunicado, jailed, beaten, traded to masked
men for two Russian soldiers and thrown into the trunk of a car.
</P>
<P>
   He was then driven through Chechnya and told he would be taken
to Azerbaijan before making his way on Friday to the capital of
Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   After threatening a hunger strike and after protests from human
rights groups, Babitsky is back in Moscow. But Russian prosecutors
are threatening to try him for carrying false documents and
cooperating with Chechen militants, an allegation he has denied.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky put on a brave face in his Radio Liberty interview,
published on its Russian-language Web site, and a separate
televised interview on the independent NTV network. Colleagues say,
however, that he has been shaken by his experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, they did not break him,'' Savik Shuster, the
director of Radio Liberty's Moscow Bureau said in an interview.
``But he thinks they did. There is a lot of fear inside of him.''
</P>
<P>
   The identity of the masked captors who took him from the
Russians is not clear. Babitsky's friends suspect they were
pro-Russian Chechens or even agents working for the Russian
intelligence services.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky did shed some light on his ordeal, which began when he
was taken to the Chernokozovo center soon after he was detained.
</P>
<P>
   At the camp, 30 miles north of Grozny, he said, ``I underwent a
`routine light initiation,' which everyone, without exception, goes
through when they arrive there,'' he told Radio Liberty, the
U.S.-financed news organization and his employer. ``That is a few
dozen blows of a truncheon on the body.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the prisoners, similarly treated, he said, were not
militants but ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that we have read about concentration camps of the
Stalin period, what we know about German camps, can be found
there,'' he told NTV.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky has agreed not to leave Moscow while charges are
pending. But he told Shuster he wants to return to work in the
North Caucasus.

 MAVS SALE IN FINAL STEPS (For use by NYTimes
News Service clients) By DWAIN PRICE c.2000 Fort Worth
Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Mavericks' Big Three flew to New York after
last night's game against the Philadelphia 76ers to face one of the
biggest days of their life.
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks owner Ross Perot Jr., owner-in-waiting Mark Cuban and
president and chief executive officer Terdema Ussery made the trek
to the Big Apple as Cuban goes through the final stages toward
gaining controlling interest in the Mavericks. Cuban will interview
with 11 members of the NBA Board of Governors today at NBA
headquarters and will need at least 22 of the 28 owners to vote
``yes'' in order for the sale of the Mavericks to successfully
change hands.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect a final vote from the owners today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one misconception that he needs to clear up a little bit
is the idea that \Rtoday\S there's going to be the interview and
there's going to be a vote,'' Ussery said. ``That's just not going
to happen, and I don't think it's ever happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Ussery said the final and formal vote may not come until the NBA
Board of Governors meets April 1. He also pointed out that the
owners still have not voted on Michael Jordan's interest in the
Washington Wizards and the ownership change of the Vancouver
Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan purchased part of the Wizards on Jan. 19, and the NBA
Board of Governors interviewed Grizzlies owner-to-be Michael
Heisley on Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia 76ers owner Pat Croce said he would be shocked if
Cuban doesn't meet final approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited he's in the league,'' Croce said. ``I love a guy
who's got enthusiasm and excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, now they don't look at me as a maverick. He can be `The
Man.' '' Rodman ruckus The NBA might be looking into the
possibility of levying a fine against Dennis Rodman or the
Mavericks because the controversial forward is not making himself
available to the media after ballgames.
</P>
<P>
   The final straw may have come after Monday night's game in
Boston, when pushing and shoving and a fight nearly broke out among
reporters, Fleet Center security and some hanger-ons as Rodman made
his way to the Mavericks' team bus after the 108-100 victory over
the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear there was an overzealous radio reporter that got a
little bit out of control,'' Mark Cuban said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman lifts weights for about 30 minutes after each game and
then it's another 20-30 minutes pass before he appears. Most of the
time, though, he exits via a back door. Once the media spots
Rodman, the chase is on, and a lot of pushing and shoving ensues.
</P>
<P>
   Told that the NBA may fine Rodman and/or the Mavericks if
Rodman's not cooperative to the media, Cuban said: ``The guy's got
to work out after the game, right? That's physically what he's got
to do. You can't bust on a guy for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, on his walk back \Rto the team bus, or to his limo
during home games\S he always makes himself available.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban also denied an ESPN report that he has given Rodman a
Lamborghini to drive around Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do these people get this \Rstuff\S?,'' Cuban asked. ``I
got in trouble \Rwith the NBA\S for leasing a '92 Lexus to Greg
Buckner that I had to take back; that was $15 a month, and we
stopped that.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, yeah, I'm going to turn around and give Dennis a
Lamborghini? Please.''

REPUBLICAN FOREIGN-POLICY PERSPECTIVES: MORALISTS VS. REALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORMAN LEVINE  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (ALSO MOVING IN ``A'' CATEGORY. / SECOND IN A SERIES OF THREE)
The author examines the Republican ``Conservative Moralist'' and
``Conservative Realist'' positions in the debate over the dire
 &UR; ction of American foreign policy.)
</P>
<P>
   The Great Foreign Policy Debate of 2000 is a cascade of ink not
limited to the battle of the journals. It has become a bonanza as
well for the publishing industry as authors from different research
institutes flood bookstores and libraries with their tomes.
</P>
<P>
   The most prestigious outlet for discussions of international
affairs is the bimonthly magazine ``Foreign Affairs,'' which
specializes in the disputations of diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment
for Peace, and his intellectual soul mate, Bill Kristol, editor of
the ``Weekly Standard'' journal, co-wrote an article in ``Foreign
Affairs''called ``Toward a Neo-Reaganite Foreign Policy,'' in which
they wrote: ``Finally, American foreign policy should be informed
with a clear moral purpose, based on the understanding that its
moral goals and its fundamental national interest are almost in
harmony . . . The remoralization of America at home ultimately
requires the remoralization of American foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   `GREAT FATHER FIGURE' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``History shows that democracies do not fight each other,''
writes Robert Kagan, who may be considered the leading advocate of
the Conservative Moralist congregation. ``American democracy should
be expansionary, and the U.S. should be more assertive and activist
in enlarging the frontiers of democracy around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take Ronald Reagan as the great father figure of American
foreign policy. Not only was Reagan skeptical of international
organizations, but he also understood the necessity for the U.S. to
act unilaterally and to intervene into the affairs of another
country on the grounds of American national interest. Reagan had an
intuitive grasp of hard power, or military force.''
</P>
<P>
   REALISM AND MORALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kagan traces his intellectual ancestry to Teddy Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I join realism and moralism,'' Kagan said, ``and so did Teddy
Roosevelt. Woodrow Wilson, for all his genius, even though he
desired to make the `world safe for democracy,' was willing to
sacrifice American sovereignty to a world government.
</P>
<P>
   ``TR (Teddy Roosevelt) would not have done that, but recognized
the need to use U.S. power unilaterally to spread American ideas
and values. Reagan was part of the TR (Roosevelt) tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ledeen, research fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, has published a book, ``Freedom Betrayed,'' that reads
like a hymn to the American system.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ledeen, the democratic revolution has passed
through two periods: The first was the American Revolution of 1776,
and the second is America in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A proselytizing Democrat, Ledeen attaches himself to the Wilson
who sought to ``make the world safe for democracy,'' and ``Freedom
Betrayed'' presents the United States as a revolutionary power, a
``chosen nation'' for converting the world to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATIC IMPERIALISM? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The dogma of Conservative Moralists is open to theological
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Kagan, Kristol and Ledeen abandon the principles of George
Kennan's ``containment policy'' through which America won the Cold
War. The containment policy was essentially a static program, for
it conformed to a bipolar world, and it assumed that both the
Soviet Union and the United States would remain on their sides of
the Iron Curtain, while Washington waited for the decay of
Stalinist Communist imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   The priesthood of Conservative Moralism wants to replace the
static nature of the containment policy with a form of democratic
imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that the post-Cold War world is a monopolar one in which
the United State is preeminent, that limits to American
expansionism no longer exist, this College of Cardinals seeks to
root the democratic flag in such far-away places as Azerbaijan,
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan (countries that few Americans even know
are on the map) _ all of which, not incidentally, are enormously
rich in oil and natural-gas deposits.
</P>
<P>
   These foreign-policy gurus have not proved their claim that
unilateral intervention into the affairs of a sovereign country is
an effective means of installing democracy in a nation. Government
through the consent of the people arises only when other supportive
institutions exist, such as a free press, an independent judiciary
and a population committed to the principles of civil rights, and
these cannot be imposed by paratroopers descending from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRACY OR CAPITALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, the prophets of Conservative Moralism do not clearly
indicate which they wish to export _ democracy or capitalism.
Michael Ledeen, however, does have the courage of his faith, for he
wishes to export the Reagan Republican Platform of 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Freedom Betrayed,''Ledeen defines the democratic
revolution: ``Today it means waging war against the growing power
of the preeminent modern institution: state bureaucracy . . That is
why the call to slash the size of government is such an integral
part of the democratic revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a difference between the American Constitution and
the Republican platform of 1980: Although it is patriotism to ask
American soldiers to fight for the Constitution, it is bottomless
greed to ask them to fight to imperialize the Reagan 1980 campaign
slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Wishing to position itself as the final arbiter of the Great
Debate, ``Foreign Affairs'' has devoted its January-February 2000
issue to the Republican side of this argument. In this issue,
Condoleezza Rice wrote the lead article, ``Promoting the National
Interest,'' an exposition of the Conservative Realist position. In
the March/April 2000 issue, ``Foreign Affairs''will follow up with
the Democratic response.
</P>
<P>
   NATION COMES FIRST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rice has deep roots in the Bush dynasty because she worked as a
Russian specialist on the National Security Council under President
Bush and presidential adviser Brent Scowcroft. A book by Bush and
Scowcroft, ``A World Transformed,'' refers to her as extremely
competent and knowledgeable.
</P>
<P>
   Re-emphasizing one of the major principles of Conservative
Realism, Rice upholds the primacy of national interest over
international organizations and norms. The theory of ``universal
human rights'' is a wonderful ideal, but here also national
interest takes priority over the banner of universal human rights.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of Russia, Rice supports the expansion of NATO to
include Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. The United States
should not be deterred by Russian anger because of the ballooning
of NATO into real estate once controlled by Soviet armies.
</P>
<P>
   The former Soviet specialist to Bush favors U.S. support for the
continued independence of the Ukraine and other countries in
Central Asia that seek to protect their sovereignty from Russian
control.
</P>
<P>
   REBUILD MILITARY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Caspian Sea region is of vital importance for U.S. interests
because of its huge oil and natural-gas reserves. In this region of
the globe, the policy of containing the Soviet Union is replaced by
the policy of dismembering Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Criticizing President Clinton for cutting the defense budget,
Rice wants to rebuild the military to throw out the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Russians and construct a
national missile-defense system. The defeat of the renewal of the
1992 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was correct. In the last
analysis, it is ``hard power,'' the persuasiveness of the bullet,
that determines the fate of nations.
</P>
<P>
   Rice favors U.S. participation in all international
organizations because such collaboration is an advantage to the
national interests of America.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she favors continued U.S. participation in the
World Trade Organization, because she favors opening markets for
U.S. exports. Trade is an important instrument of U.S. foreign
policy, and the international reduction of tariffs and other trade
barriers represents a gain to the United States because it helps
create an entrepreneurial capitalist class in whatever nation
becomes a partner in these commercial networks.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding trade with China, the former national security adviser
believes, is in American national self-interest because it will
speed economic liberalization, and the emergence of an aggressive
capitalist phalanx could act as the springboard for the sprouting
of political democracy. Unlike Clinton, however, Rice does not view
China as a ``strategic partner'' but as a ``strategic competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Realists want to maintain Taiwanese
independence, and they image themselves as the party of the right
on the China issue. In essence, they want to create an East Asian
``rollback theory'' in the style of John Foster Dulles, keeping
China out of Taiwan and forcing China out of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   CEASE BEING WORLD'S POLICE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From her new position at Stanford University, Rice launched has
her most spirited diatribes against the Clinton administration on
the question of humanitarian intervention. She points to the
failure of such action in Haiti and to the ineffectiveness of
multilateral humanitarian intervention in Somalia,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the United States exerts hard hegemonic power in the
world, it should not act as the earth's ``globocop.'' Rice does not
believe that it is within the national interest of the United
States to play the universal gendarme.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Rice an authoritative voice from the Conservative
Realist pew, but the probable ghostwriter on foreign policy for
Gov. George W. Bush. There is no difference in substance between
the Rice essay and a speech on America's position in the world that
Bush gave to kick off his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Jeane Kirkpatrick, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under
Reagan, agrees with Rice, particularly on the need to protect U.S.
sovereignty and to build an anti-ballistic missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am glad the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was defeated,''
Kirkpatrick confessed. ``I worked for five years at the U.N., and I
can tell you that votes in the General Assembly are often stampeded
and ill-informed. There are over 150 members in the General
Assembly, and the vast majority have no experience with nuclear
weapons, and so their votes are not based on fact or experience. It
is wrong to give such a body a literal veto over American
armaments, defense and national interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall discussing the issue of the anti-ballistic missile
defense system with Ronald Reagan. The president looked upon a
system which could prevent an attack as a moral imperative because
it would prevent incalculable carnage. He believed that the policy
of MAD _ mutually assured destruction _ was immoral because it left
open the possibility of attack and cataclysmic bloodshed. To be
able to deter such an attack was equal to defending against
unprecedented inhumanity.''
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN BEEFS UP HIS TEAM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain is also a member of the Conservative Realist
choir.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, McCain has added some illustrious names to his
foreign-policy team. Other notable foreign-policy sages now stand
alongside Henry Kissinger in the ex-Navy pilot's camp, and they
include Zbigniew Brzezinski, Larry Eagleberger, Kirkpatrick and R.
James Woolsey.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-prisoner of war also looks suspiciously upon mainland
China. Although McCain supports the maintainence of normal trade
relations with China, he looks upon that country of 1.2 billion
people as a rival to the United State in the Pacific Rim, and he
stands firmly for continued independence of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The November election will undoubtedly witness impassioned
disagreements over China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
China already enjoys most-favored-nation trading rights with the
United States and a mushrooming trade surplus.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA AT CENTER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Judging China as a potential adversary, McCain wants to link
membership in the World Trade Organization with domestic
liberalization in China. Rather than remain in a state of Clinton
self-denial, Conservative Realists want China to broaden universal
rights, grant religious freedom and cease political repression
before granting it equal representation in the trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether Bush or McCain becomes the GOP
presidential contender, China will become the center of gravity of
the foreign-policy debates. For most of the 12 years that
Republicans held the White House, from 1980 to 1992 under Reagan
and George Bush, the Cold War raged and Republicans looked tougher
on the Soviet Union than Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Evil Empire'' has disappeared, the bipolar world is a
theme of the past, but the Republicans have also suffered their
losses: They can no longer appear as the knights of anti-communism.
To reinvent their image as Sir Lancelot slaying the Red Dragon,
they are trying to paint Beijing as the Second KGB. Abiding by the
philosophy of ``Wag the Dog,'' if a war does not exist, then it is
necessary to invent one.

   IRVING, Texas _ While Deion Sanders remains a lame duck for the
Cowboys and a long shot with the Cincinnati Reds, .MDBU/two[ a pair
of].MDNM/ unrestricted free agents have begun the audition process
for a chance to compete for the starting right cornerback job that
Deion Sanders has held since 1995.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ryan McNeil, a six-year veteran who started for the Cleveland
Browns last season and was the NFL's interception leader (nine)
with the St. Louis Rams in 1997, visited Valley Ranch yesterday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   .MDBU/Phillippi.MDNM/ Sparks, an eight-year veteran and a
full-time starter with the New York Giants since his second year in
the league (1993), arrived in Dallas last night and will meet with
Cowboys' management and coaches today. Sparks and Cowboys strong
safety Darren Woodson were childhood friends. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just playing it by ear,'' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said
of the cornerback visits. ``We don't have any plan \Rfor signing
either one or both\S ... nothing that succinct.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jones added that ``possibly other cornerbacks'' will be invited
to Valley Ranch, along with ``three or four quarterbacks'' from
which one will be signed to replace Jason Garrett as Troy Aikman's
backup. Jones declined to name names.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McNeil and Sparks become only the second and third unrestricted
free agents to visit the Cowboys. The other was cornerback
De.MDBU/R.MDNM/on Jenkins, who later signed with San Diego. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Jones, Cowboys vice president//director of player
personnel, said that the Cowboys' next step will be to ``continue
doing our homework on \RMcNeil and Sparks\S ... and contact their
agents.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McNeil's agent is Eugene Parker. Sparks is represented by Frank
Bauer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are expected to release Sanders on June 2, which is
the window that allows them the greatest salary-cap relief. Sanders
told reporters in Florida over the weekend that he definitely is
done in Dallas and wants to continue his NFL career with a team
that has a chance to get to the Super Bowl.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cornerbacks Kevin Smith and Kevin Mathis, who missed eight games
apiece last season because of injuries, will be back next season.
Joining them will be 1999 rookie cornerback Duane Hawthorne, who
has been assigned to NFL Europe, and possibly five-year veteran
Charlie Williams, an unrestricted free agent. &QL;

 &UR; of new books:
</P>
<P>
   ``ROBIN HOOD WAS RIGHT'' &QL; 
By Chuck Collins and Pam Rogers (Norton, $28.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wait! Don't mail those checks yet. Collins and Rogers have
advice about charitable giving that will help you donate your money
with thought and purpose rather than with guilt and self-interest.
Americans gave $109 billion to charity last year, yet one in four
top earners gave nothing, the wealthy gave smaller portions of
their assets than did the poor, and only 13 percent of the money
went to direct public benefit through human service programs (most
went to churches, the arts, elite private universities and
hospitals). Here, the authors attempt to redefine modern
philanthropy in order to affect change _ instead of focusing on the
immediate symptoms of social or economic problems, they want our
dollars to chip away at the CAUSES of those problems. Collins and
Rogers are dedicated, energetic, knowledgeable and frankly, a bit
daunting in their zeal. But you'll learn something if you listen to
them. As Alfre Woodard writes in her preface, ``Robin Hood was
right. And he had a damn good time.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``HAWKE'S COVE'' &QL; 
By Susan Wilson (Pocket, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's one for the ``Bridges of Madison County'' crowd, another
novel that attempts to parlay yearning and denial into a bad but
bittersweet bestseller. A young journal-keeping woman named Vangie
retreats to her grandmother's farm in a small coastal town (note
the title) to recover from the death of her baby and to wait for
news of her husband, who is overseas fighting in World War II. It's
not long before a down-on-his-luck stranger named Joe shows up, and
we know what that means. Vangie hires him to work on the farm, they
drink tea and lemonade, they watch each other through lowered
lashes, they swim (``There is,'' Wilson writes, ``a strange
intimacy in swimming . . .''), she spreads ointment on his
blistered hands. When Vangie's husband is declared missing in
action, she and Joe have a hot night together in the hayloft, but
word comes the very next morning that the husband is still alive.
Denial commences. Years pass. Violins play. Their children grow up
and get nosey. Have you been here before? You betcha. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``FOREVER LIESL'' &QL; 
By Charmian Carr (Viking, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We were hoping to find some dirt here, but according to Carr,
there was precious little of it on the set of ``The Sound of
Music.'' Until now, the only relief from the unrelenting sweetness
of the film was an anecdote about Christopher Plummer, who played
Baron von Trapp and who allegedly hated the movie so much he called
it ``The Sound of Mucus.'' But Carr, who played the von Trapp
daughter Liesl, debunks that story, saying that Plummer himself
denies it (he did despise the song ``Edelweiss'' and tried to have
it tossed from the film). Mostly, this book is a cheerful report on
a cheerful experience, with some funny moments on the side. When
she attended the Mexican premiere (the film was called ``La Novicia
Rebelde,'' or ``The Rebellious Novice''), the unsuspecting Carr was
taken to a bullfight. The matador dedicated the bull to her, and
she watched in horror as the bull was tormented by the matador and
the matador was then run over by the bull. She visited the matador
in the hospital, as Liesl certainly would have done if she'd been
there. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``THE VISION OF EMMA BLAU'' &QL; 
By Ursula Hegi (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hegi's new novel is a family saga that begins in the early
1900s, when scrappy teenager Stefan Blau comes to America from
Germany (specifically from Burgdorf, which figures into Hegi's
earlier books, ``Stones From the River'' and ``Floating in My
Mother's Palm''), and sets out to make his fortune. After a fire in
the New York restaurant where he works, he leaves the city and goes
to a small town in New Hampshire because a fellow immigrant has
told him it reminded him of Germany. There, Stefan marries twice
and loses both wives to the births of his children before he
returns to Burgdorf to bring back and marry Helene Montag, his
childhood friend and the character through which Hegi explores the
difficult adjustment of the German immigrant. Serving as a backdrop
for the story is the Wasserburg, the grand and glorious apartment
building that Stefan builds, which reflects the fortunes of his
family. Hegi's characterization is superb, part of a story that is
as well-constructed as the Wasserburg itself.  &QL;

CLEAR CHANNEL IN $3 BILLION DEAL TO ACQUIRE SFX ENTERTAINMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Advertising) 
(bl) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The big broadcast and outdoor advertising company
Clear Channel Communications Inc. said Tuesday that it would
acquire SFX Entertainment Inc., the largest producer of live
concerts, theater and sports events, for about $3.3 billion in
stock. The deal is emblematic of the increasing consolidation and
concentration of media and entertainment interests.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition, which includes the assumption of about $1.1
billion in SFX debt, would create a diversified powerhouse with
stakes in everything from Broadway theaters, television and
billboards to monster truck rallies, radio and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is intended to help Clear Channel extend its
advertising reach to concerts and sporting events. Such a move will
help the company gain additional advertising dollars from the
nation's largest marketers by delivering the consumers whom the
advertisers crave most, particularly younger men.
</P>
<P>
   The company will also be able to use its radio stations to
promote SFX events. Clear Channel will become No. 1 in radio after
completing a $23.5 billion deal to buy another big owner of radio
stations, AMFM Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a nice, natural fit here,'' said Christopher Ensley,
an analyst at Lazard Freres &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clear Channel already participates in over a thousand concerts
a year, promoting them through its radio stations, driving
listeners to local car dealerships or Sears outlets by raffling off
tickets,'' he added. ``Knowing who the concertgoers are, whether
the live acts are being received well in those markets, creates a
lot of opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal emulates those that have produced entertainment and
media conglomerates like News Corp., Time Warner Inc. and Tribune
Co., which offer advertisers cross-promotional programs meant to
deliver diverse types of consumers across operations like broadcast
and cable television networks, sports teams, magazines, movie
studios, newspapers and Web sites. The goal is to integrate as
seamlessly as possible content _ whether a sitcom, a rock concert
or a wrestling match _ and the means to distribute that content.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a primal DNA of this,'' said Robert F.X. Sillerman,
executive chairman at SFX in New York. ``If you have distribution,
and you then distribute the proper content, it makes your
distribution better. And the improved distribution encourages
better content.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had remarkable success creating national platforms for
advertisers and marketers such as Levi Strauss, Anheuser-Busch and
American Express in live entertainment,'' he added. ``What they're
gaining is access to the 60 million people who attend our events.
When you overlay a broadcast component, it's even more
compelling.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sillerman disputed suggestions that deals like the acquisition
of SFX, which is expected to be completed early in the third
quarter, unfairly concentrate ownership of premier entertainment
and media properties in too few hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true we're both getting bigger,'' Sillerman said. ``And
in this case, bigger is better. But one of the wonderful things
about America is that there's fierce competition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't deny the fact people are concerned,'' he added, ``and
there are things you have to be careful about. But some great
things come from having the size and resources to experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Sillerman said, SFX ``built stages outside our
amphitheaters'' so that less well-known bands could gain exposure
by playing for concertgoers on their way in to see the headliners.
</P>
<P>
   ``That required a company of our size to do that,'' he said.
``And if you take a look at the radio business, owning multiple
stations provides an opportunity to experiment with different
formats.''
</P>
<P>
   The SFX holdings, which have been broadened through recent
acquisitions worth $2.2 billion in stock, loans and debt, include
concert tours and theatrical entertainment in 31 of the top 50
markets; figure skating championship exhibitions; Internet
operations like www.firstinline.com, a ticket sales Web site; and
management agencies that represent active and retired athletes like
Andre Agassi and Michael Jordan in sports including baseball,
basketball, soccer and tennis.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of SFX to Clear Channel, which owns or has deals for
867 radio and 19 television stations that reach more than 120
million people weekly, is, well, clear. SFX can help Clear Channel
appeal to advertisers seeking fans of music and sports,
particularly the elusive demographic group of younger men.
</P>
<P>
   And ``they can use the Clear Channel radio platform to promote
events in a bigger way and increase attendance,'' said Frank L.
Bodenchak, a broadcast analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in
New York. ``They can also sell advertising sponsorships at the
venues and on the radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Clear Channel, which is based in San Antonio, will have radio
stations and billboards in virtually every market where SFX owns
arenas and amphitheaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This transaction allows Clear Channel, through SFX, to gain
immediate leadership in the highly attractive live entertainment
segment,'' Lowry Mays, chairman and chief executive at Clear
Channel, said in a statement, ``while taking advantage of the
natural relationship between radio and live music events.''
</P>
<P>
   Clear Channel will also ``pursue initiatives relating to the
Internet and music,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The deal is subject to approval by SFX shareholders and
regulators. Terms call for each Class A share of SFX to be
exchanged for sixth-tenths of a share of Clear Channel common
stock. Each Class B share of SFX would be exchanged for one share
of Clear Channel common stock.
</P>
<P>
   SFX Class A shares rose 50 cents Tuesday, to $38.50, on the New
York Stock Exchange. Shares of Clear Channel fell $8.5625, to
$66.625.
</P>
<P>
   SFX had 63.8 million Class A shares outstanding as of November
and 1.55 million Class B shares. The shares differ in voting power:
Class A is entitled to one vote each and Class B, 10 votes each.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney advised Clear Channel in the acquisition,
while Bear Stearns advised SFX and Lehman Brothers advised an SFX
committee of independent directors.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``a surprisingly easy decision'' to accept the Clear
Channel offer, Sillerman said, which came ``so quickly, less than a
month'' ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't talking with CBS,'' he added, referring to
speculation that he had been in negotiations to be acquired by CBS
Corp., which is itself being bought by Viacom Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were approached by Clear Channel,'' Sillerman said, ``and
we know them well; these are friends of mine. They wanted to make a
compelling argument that it would be a good idea to merge the
companies, so I said I'd listen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have Jones Beach Amphitheater in Long Island,'' he added,
``and Clear Channel has many radio stations in New York like Z-100.
It was pretty easy to see the benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   After the acquisition, Sillerman said, ``100 percent of the
operating people'' at SFX will remain at Clear Channel. As for his
future, he continued: ``It's unclear. Certainly there'll be a
transition period for at least some time. Ordinarily, I wouldn't
think about staying on, but there's such an interesting
opportunity, I'm seriously considering it.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal brings SFX full circle, Ensley noted, because the
company was originally spun off from SFX Broadcasting, a radio
station group, when Sillerman decided that ``his best bet was
pursuing the concert venue business'' because ``he realized he
wasn't going to be able to compete with a Clear Channel'' for
dominance in radio.
</P>
<P>
   Sillerman said, Mays ``has ended up acquiring close to 150 radio
stations we used to own.''

   IRVING, Texas _ While Deion Sanders remains a lame duck for the
Cowboys and a long shot with the Cincinnati Reds, two unrestricted
free agents have begun the audition process for a chance to compete
for the starting right cornerback job that Deion Sanders has held
since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan McNeil, a six-year veteran who started for the Cleveland
Browns last season and was the NFL's interception leader (nine)
with the St. Louis Rams in 1997, visited Valley Ranch yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Phillippi Sparks, an eight-year veteran and a full-time starter
with the New York Giants since his second year in the league
(1993), arrived in Dallas last night and will meet with Cowboys'
management and coaches today. Sparks and Cowboys strong safety
Darren Woodson were childhood friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just playing it by ear,'' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said
of the cornerback visits. ``We don't have any plan \Rfor signing
either one or both\S ... nothing that succinct.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones added that ``possibly other cornerbacks'' will be invited
to Valley Ranch, along with ``three or four quarterbacks'' from
which one will be signed to replace Jason Garrett as Troy Aikman's
backup. Jones declined to name names.
</P>
<P>
   McNeil and Sparks become only the second and third unrestricted
free agents to visit the Cowboys. The other was cornerback DeRon
Jenkins, who later signed with San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Jones, Cowboys vice president/director of player
personnel, said that the Cowboys' next step will be to ``continue
doing our homework on \RMcNeil and Sparks\S ... and contact their
agents.''
</P>
<P>
   McNeil's agent is Eugene Parker. Sparks is represented by Frank
Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are expected to release Sanders on June 2, which is
the window that allows them the greatest salary-cap relief. Sanders
told reporters in Florida over the weekend that he definitely is
done in Dallas and wants to continue his NFL career with a team
that has a chance to get to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerbacks Kevin Smith and Kevin Mathis, who missed eight games
apiece last season because of injuries, will be back next season.
Joining them will be 1999 rookie cornerback Duane Hawthorne, who
has been assigned to NFL Europe, and possibly five-year veteran
Charlie Williams, an unrestricted free agent.

 &HT;    Bush win in Virginia keeps bad news at bay
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Gov. George W. Bush's solid win in Virginia, a
victory that guaranteed at least a split decision in Tuesday's
contests, was good-enough news for a candidate who might not be
able to survive more bad news.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, better news would include a victory in Washington
state, proving his ability to win north of the Mason-Dixon line.
Washington votes still were being tallied late Tuesday, however,
and polls were giving Arizona Sen. John McCain an early edge.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush was ready to portray Virginia as a big win that put
him ``one step closer to victory'' and the GOP ``one step closer to
having a united party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight, in an open primary, by a solid margin of what appears
to be 15 to 16 points, the voters of Virginia rejected the politics
of pitting one religion against another,'' Bush told supporters
here, referring to McCain's attempts to paint the Texas governor as
anti-Catholic because he spoke at a Bob Jones University, a South
Carolina school with anti-Catholic philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush victory rally came as votes were still being counted in
Washington and while North Dakota caucuses _ where Bush was
expected to do well _ were still in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials packaged the Virginia win with his
weekend victories in American Samoa, Guam, the Virgin Islands and
Puerto Rico and declared themselves on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been 113 delegates at stake since Michigan and
Arizona,'' said Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes. ``So this is the
biggest week yet in the primaries and we hope to win the lion's
share of the delegates.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Virginia victory, in which he picked up all 56 of the
state's delegates, comes at a crucial time. Super Tuesday is March
7, when 613 delegates will be awarded in 12 states around the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, crummy Tuesday for Bush, McCain took a surprisingly
easy win in Michigan and trounced Bush in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Bush believes he has the right message but has been hampered by
the wrong electorate in primaries open to all voters, instead of
just Republicans. McCain's overwhelming strength among independents
and Democrats has served him well in the open primaries held so
far.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's exit poll numbers showed Bush pulling 33 percent of
the independent vote in Virginia. Last week in Michigan, Bush
earned only 26 percent of the independent votes.
</P>
<P>
   In the next two weeks, 1,132 delegates will be awarded,
including 505 in contests open only to Republicans. The first
candidate to earn 1,034 delegates wins the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia exit polls also showed Bush winning among almost
every demographic group, other than independents and Democrats.
Sixty-five percent of the Virginia voters identified themselves as
Republicans, and 71 percent of them voted for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Only 19 percent identified themselves as members of the
religious right, and 83 percent of them voted for Bush. McCain and
Bush split the other 81 percent of the Virginia vote.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line for Bush in Virginia is that the victory was a
significant boost, but not as significant as a loss would have
been. McCain would have garnered a lot of mileage out of a win
there.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Buchanan, a University of Texas government professor, said
the Virginia win, no matter how you slice it, is big for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's reinforcement for the Bush people who've argued right
along that when you get into Bush territory, his natural advantages
start to assert themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan also believes McCain scored no points in Virginia by
bashing Virginia-based religious right leaders Pat Robertson and
Jerry Falwell _ both Bush backers _ on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic, however, might pay off for McCain in New York and
other states, according to Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's basically playing a risky national game now in an effort
to redefine the heart and soul of the Republican Party,'' he said.
``I don't think he regards the Virginia loss as particularly
unexpected.''

MARKET PLACE: TOP WALL STREET EXECUTIVES URGE TRADING OVERHAUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: budgeted earlier as MARKETS-CONGRESS)  
(bl) 
 By ALEX BERENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The debate over the future of U.S. securities markets
entered high gear Tuesday as Wall Street's top executives told
senators that the current system is sometimes unfair to investors
and could cost the United States its position as the world's
financial capital.
</P>
<P>
   At a packed hearing of the Senate Banking Committee in the New
York financial district, with an armed guard posted at the door,
the executives urged the government to force competing stock
markets to work more closely together. Their goal, they said, is to
ensure that investors both large and small get the best price when
they trade stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd see the day I was arguing for
regulation,'' Henry M. Paulson, the chairman of the Goldman Sachs
Group, told Sen. Phil Gramm, R- Texas, who heads the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Paulson said the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq stock
market, the world's two largest stock markets, must move quickly to
open their systems to new electronic exchanges that give investors
the chance to trade directly with each other.
</P>
<P>
   That move will lower trading costs for investors and ensure that
most trading continues to take place in the United States, under
the eye of the Securities and Exchange Commission, he said. The
chairmen of Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Credit
Suisse First Boston shared that view.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard A. Grasso, the chairman and chief executive of the
New York Stock Exchange, which has the most to lose from a radical
revamping of the current system, counseled the committee against
intervening. The exchange's system already offers investors the
best deal when they trade stocks, and the exchange is moving
quickly to cut costs and increase trade speed, he said. Still,
Grasso acknowledged that his exchange ``is facing the most
challenging competitive environment in its 208-year history.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank G. Zarb, the chairman of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, which is the parent of the Nasdaq market, told
the committee that Nasdaq is working on an improved trading system
that should alleviate most of the panel's concerns. Nasdaq is
building a stock market that will eventually connect investors
around the world with around-the-clock trading, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schwab, the chairman of Charles Schwab Corp., the San
Francisco-based brokerage firm that has grown into a giant by
catering to individual investors, also disagreed with Paulson. The
proposal championed by Goldman and the other banks will ``never be
as efficient as truly competitive markets,'' Schwab said.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the dispute is a sudden proliferation in the ways that
investors can buy or sell stocks in the United States. Until
recently, most trades were routed either through the New York Stock
Exchange or the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   The two markets use very different systems to determine the
price of a stock. On the Nasdaq, ``market makers'' act as
intermediaries between buyers and sellers. As investor demand for
the shares shifts, each of the market makers adjusts its prices in
response. But small investors almost never have the chance to trade
directly with each other, and larger investors also route many of
their trades through market makers.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq's system of competing market makers also encourages
``payment for order flow,'' where market makers pay brokers for the
chance to execute customers' orders. Although perfectly legal, that
practice leads some observers to wonder if Nasdaq's market makers
are really competing on price.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few years, that system has come under increasing
pressure as changes in Nasdaq's rules and ever-cheaper
communications equipment have promoted the development of
all-electronic networks that can quickly match orders of any size
without the intervention of a market maker.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, all buy and sell orders are
routed through a single ``specialist,'' guaranteeing that most
small trades can be matched directly. But most larger trades are
delivered to the specialist on the floor of the exchange by human
brokers, a system that big investors view as increasingly
inefficient.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the new markets could combine the Nasdaq's efficiency
with the Big Board's ability to directly match investors. But the
investment banks and Arthur Levitt, the SEC chairman, are concerned
that the new exchanges could hurt more investors than they help if
they are not integrated into the current system. If the exchanges
are not linked, stocks could trade at different prices on different
markets, and investors may not get the best price for their trades,
Levitt warned in his testimony Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a big difference, in short, between an efficient
trading system and an efficient national market system,'' Levitt
said. ``Our sights should be set on the latter.''
</P>
<P>
   The major investment banks said Tuesday that the best way of
ensuring that a fragmentation of markets did not hurt investors was
to force all the exchanges to share their price and order data in a
national ``central limit order book.'' That way, an investor who
offers to sell 100 shares of XYZ Co. on one exchange for $50 could
be matched with an investor offering to buy the stock for the same
price on a different exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC has not yet taken a position on whether that step is the
right one, although Levitt is clearly concerned about
fragmentation. ``In today's market, dealers who quote aggressively
and investors who offer to buy or sell at prices better than any
other price in the market may go unrewarded,'' he said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the New York Stock Exchange, which still controls the vast
majority of the trading on its listed stocks, is wary of linking to
a broader system just yet. ``Linked markets help to ensure
consumers are well protected,'' Grasso said. ``However, instead of
debating whether more government intervention is required to
achieve those protections, we should allow instantaneous
communications and competition to fully blossom.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, while the plan put forward by the securities firms
is fairly comprehensive, a host of issues still need to be worked
out, including the details of how the markets would be linked and
the way that giant institutional orders would be handled.
Institutions like mutual funds often worry that if they disclose
their plans to buy a stock, copycats will move quickly and drive up
the stock before the purchase is completed.

 &HT;    Despite past, GOP South behind Bush
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Just a dozen years ago, voters much like those who
stood in line together Tuesday to give Gov. George W. Bush a solid
win in Virginia were at each other's throats across the South.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, factions supporting Pat Robertson and former
President George Bush went to court over who had control of the
facility where the state convention was held. In North Carolina, a
Republican caucus nearly turned into a brawl.
</P>
<P>
   The feud went all the way to the national convention in New
Orleans, and provoked quite a few Southern Republicans to red-faced
rage, which is all the more reason they don't want to be reminded
of it this year.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe in their heart of hearts, some supporters of the elder and
younger Bush didn't disagree entirely with Arizona Sen. John
McCain's fiery denunciation Monday of Robertson and Jerry Falwell.
</P>
<P>
   But the bitter memory of the religious wars of the '80s has only
firmed the resolve of the Southern Bushites to stand by their man,
judging by the Texas governor's success in Virginia Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``His (McCain's) message is not projecting an image of
inclusiveness, like Reagan. It's saying let's run somebody out of
the damn party,'' said Oscar Persons, a Bush supporter in Atlanta
who had his share of run-ins with the Robertson forces back in '88.
</P>
<P>
   McCain really wasn't appealing in his speech to the party
regulars, who have grown accustomed over the past decade to sitting
next to the Christian Coalition table at party functions. Both
groups this year share a common aversion to McCain's ideas about
campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was trying to strike a chord with a younger, less
involved group of voters, who may very well show up in California,
New York and other states next week.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for McCain is that even if he can bring in a lot of
Republican moderates and newcomers, the combination of antagonists
from another decade in the South and Midwest helps to harden Bush's
lock on the nomination, like asphalt baking on a Sun Belt road.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 60 percent of those who voted in Virginia on Tuesday
described themselves as conservative and more than 70 percent said
they were Republicans. In the national eye, it makes no difference
whether they were Robertson Republicans, which is one hospitality
room at the state convention, or Bushites, which is quite another.
</P>
<P>
   While the results from Virginia seemed to blunt McCain's gamble
in Virginia Beach as a nomination strategy, the early returns from
Washington State signaled a continuing worry for the Bush camp.
</P>
<P>
   One Bush aide was heard to grumble after McCain's speech that he
was trying to burn down the party as he's leaving it. Bush's letter
to Cardinal John J. O'Connor, regretting that he didn't stress his
opposition to anti-Catholic bigotry in his Bob Jones University
speech, is another token of the discomfort the religious struggles
of the past week have caused him.
</P>
<P>
   The South appears to be delivering the nomination to Bush while
his strength outside the region remains suspect. And McCain's
challenge to Robertson and Falwell, whether it gets immediate
results at the polls or not, is likely to resonate throughout this
election year.

 ANALYSIS: McCAIN FAILS TO MAKE HEADWAY AMONG CONSERVATIVES IN(With ELN-RDP) 
(sw) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. _ Whatever else Sen. John McCain of Arizona
achieved in his short, sharp foray into Virginia this week, he
certainly moved no closer to the Republican presidential
nomination. His long-shot attack on the leaders of the religious
right bore no immediate fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's primary here was a victory for Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas in more than one sense.
</P>
<P>
   He piled up an imposing margin and took all 56 delegates in the
nation's 12th largest state _ a southern state, like South
Carolina, where Bush won just 10 days ago, but a much less
provincial one, with huge military installations as well as wealthy
Washington suburbs where some of the nation's fastest-growing
high-technology companies are based.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Texan's first triumph in a large, economically and
politically diverse state with aspirations to national leadership.
</P>
<P>
   More important, he once again denied McCain the kind of showing
among Republican voters that McCain desperately needs. The Arizonan
took only 26 percent of the Republican vote in South Carolina and
only 29 percent last week in Michigan; after a week of proclaiming
himself ``a proud Reagan Republican'' in costly barrages of
television advertisements, he did no better in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   In a state where 55 percent of the voters described themselves
as conservatives, McCain did poorly among them. Twice as many
self-described conservatives voted for Bush as for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Adherents of the religious right were not as numerous in
Virginia as in South Carolina, accounting for only about 20 percent
of the electorate, but they once again exerted a potent influence
on the outcome. Bush won the backing of an overwhelming percentage
of them _ almost eight out of ten, according to the exit polling _
but he and McCain ran even among voters who said that they did not
identify with Christian conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   McCain did well, and Bush did badly, among Democrats and
independents who crossed over into the Republican primary. That
brought no cheer to Bush backers, because the Texan has been
striving to picture himself as the man who can lead the Republicans
to victory in November.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seems unable to break out of a right-wing box, even though
he has begun re-emphasizing ``compassionate conservatism.'' On
Tuesday night, however, in a victory speech delivered at a rally in
Cincinnati, he asserted that ``we are expanding our base without
destroying our foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt McCain has galvanized much of the country, including
many people who have been alienated from politics in recent years.
His national approval rating in the most recent ABC News/Washington
Post poll has risen to 60 percent from 36 percent at the end of
October, while Bush's has been slipping. He is well situated for a
general election contest.
</P>
<P>
   But as Prof. Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia
commented, ``You can't possibly win the Republican nomination with
just Democratic and independent votes. You need Republican as well
as Democratic and independent support.'' Moreover, Democrats and
independents will be barred from voting for McCain (or any other
Republican) in the New York primary next Tuesday or in the
delegate-selection election in California on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show McCain trailing in both of those states, as well as
Texas and Florida, which will vote a week later, on March 14. Those
four states, the nation's four largest, will among them choose more
than 45 percent of the 1,034 delegates needed for the Republican
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The week between the Michigan primary and the voting on Tuesday
_ the state of Washington also held a primary and North Dakota
staged caucuses _ had been marked by frantic repositioning efforts.
McCain tried hard to counter suggestions that he was insufficiently
or unreliably conservative, and Bush struggled against suggestions
that he was anti-Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   But not much changed in the pattern of voting. The same acute
ideological split that has shown up elsewhere was evident in
Virginia, with Bush, for example, winning most of those who oppose
abortion and attach great importance to moral issue and McCain
winning most of those who back abortion rights and care more deeply
about taxes and foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Some of McCain's supporters had suggested that his speech on
Monday in Virginia Beach, in which he denounced Pat Robertson and
the Rev. Jerry Falwell, two of the Christian right's best-known
leaders (and both Virginians), would prompt an outpouring of
liberal and moderate Republicans o his behalf. According to exit
polls, nothing like that happened; indeed, of the small number of
voters who said they had decided at the last minute, most went to
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the McCain camp hinted that the senator had been
looking beyond Virginia to New York and California, hoping to win
the backing of the numerous centrist voters there who object to the
religious right. From that perspective, it is too early to evaluate
the Virginia Beach speech.
</P>
<P>
   The debates over which candidate was the real reformer and which
was more honest, so steamy only a few days ago, seemed not to have
fazed most Virginians. They said both were reformers and both
talked straight.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had hoped for a victory here to build upon his Michigan
upset, and if he had brought it off it could have demoralized the
Bush campaign on the eve of the biggest test of the year, the
voting next Tuesday, which will include primaries in Ohio, Georgia,
Massachusetts, Missouri and other states as well as California and
New York. But no Republican has won on two big election nights in a
row this year, and the pattern held.
</P>
<P>
   With the backing of Gov. James S. Gilmore III and Sen. John W.
Warner, Bush was always the clear favorite; indeed, before
Michigan, McCain had seemed ready to give Virginia a pass. By not
doing so, he made the contest seem more important than it would
otherwise have been.

HELP FOR THE MANAGER'S SPOUSE WHO SLURPS SOUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SANA SIWOLOP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The corporate executive was seeking help from Charles Sacarello,
a New York consultant who specializes in brushing up the images of
the upwardly mobile.
</P>
<P>
   The executive had a problem that threatened to derail his
career: his socially inept wife.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few months earlier, the client had been on the fast
track. As a candidate for a seat on his company's board, he had
been invited with his wife for dinner and drinks at the home of
another senior executive. The top brass were all there.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a disaster. First, his wife told some off-color
jokes. Then, embarrassed by the icy response, she gulped down
several drinks. The evening ended when she fell, fully dressed,
into the host's swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after that, the board position fell through and the
executive was told that he had gone as far in the company as he
ever would. He found a new job, and now he wanted his wife to be
coached on how to act like a business partner. ``It became obvious
to both of them that they were on display,'' said Sacarello, who is
45. Happily, he added, ``the marriage survived.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives' wives _ and husbands _ are on Sacarello's mind a lot
these days. Most corporate managers are used to taking courses and
reading books on how to get ahead. But the advice they get usually
centers on exploiting their own skills and resourcefulness.
</P>
<P>
   Sacarello, though, sees a huge need for managers to pay more
attention to their spouses' appearance and behavior. In his 15
years as an image consultant, he has encountered too many career
stoppers, from husbands or wives with abysmal table manners to
those who show up for social weekends with five suitcases.
</P>
<P>
   His firm, Charles &AMP; Associates, recently rolled out a program to
polish corporate spouses' public persona by teaching them
everything from Continental table manners and how much jewelry to
wear (``Don't look like a Christmas tree,'' he advises) to finding
the right phrase to break the ice in awkward moments.
</P>
<P>
   Other image consultants say he is on to something. They point to
the growing diversity in executive suites. More women are breaking
through the glass ceiling, for example, meaning that husbands as
well as wives need help. And more power couples with modest
economic backgrounds are sailing up the corporate ladder together,
meaning that sometimes both spouses could use a little enhancement
of their social graces.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the consultants say, with the line between work and
home increasingly blurring, more corporate mates are getting caught
in the limelight than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Scanlon, an executive search consultant in Stamford,
Conn., said he had noticed that spouses now receive more attention
than in the past during the recruitment process. And Debra Lund, a
spokeswoman for Franklin Covey Co., a professional services firm in
Salt Lake City, says that more of the companies that hire her firm
to give training seminars are extending them to spouses and other
family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are recognizing that they have more stakeholders
than the people who work immediately within the walls of their
companies,'' Lund said.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to rehabilitating wayward spouses, however, some
image consultants think companies should do more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is an undisclosed need for this type of help
that hasn't been tapped, with both companies and senior managers
reluctant to talk about it,'' said Don Kaufman, who runs an
image-consulting firm in Philadelphia with his wife, Karen Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   Camille Lavington, an image consultant in New York, says most
corporate spouses that she takes on as clients are women and they
can become unnerved by the social demands thrust upon them as their
husbands rise rapidly in the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless they've been exposed to heavy socialization, the
average wife is so afraid that she will do something to impede her
husband's success that she turns reticent and doesn't make an
effort to get involved, or charitable,'' she said. ``They're so
self-conscious that they don't know how to make the other person
feel comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporate husbands can also feel self-conscious. According to
Bill Higgins, a former FBI agent and retired Navy captain, they can
feel the need for guidance as well.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 12 years, Higgins has been married to Barbara
Corcoran, the founder of the Corcoran Group real estate firm.
Higgins sold his own real estate business in 1997, and although he
still has business interests of his own, about a year ago he began
carrying a business card labeled ``spouse,'' to give him an
identity, he said. In February, , he went one step further and
formed a club made up of husbands like him; four members showed up
at the kickoff meeting. And he has just started a Web site,
www.spouseclub.com, to provide guidance to corporate spouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be a marriage counselor,'' Higgins said, ``but
I do want to help the person whose wife is in a corporate position
and who finds himself having to play the support role.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavington says empathy is the first thing she teaches her
clients, so they can put other people at ease _ an important asset
in business. Sacarello of Charles &AMP; Associates thinks the key often
is simply to bolster a spouse's self-esteem. As an example, he
cited a client who held a blue-collar job and who, in the past, had
made virtually no effort to provide support for his executive wife,
who worked for a company that required her to socialize a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We taught this individual to value himself for what he did,
and we made a list of his positive traits, like the fact that he
has a good brain, personality, and can sustain a conversation, as
well as hold a drink,'' Sacarello said. ``Now his attitude is
completely different, and he and his wife come across as a couple.
Our goal is that when two people walk into a room, nobody needs to
know who the highflier is or isn't.''

REPUBLICAN FOREIGN-POLICY PERSPECTIVES: MORALISTS VS. REALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORMAN LEVINE  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (ALSO MOVING IN ``A'' CATEGORY. / SECOND IN A SERIES OF THREE)
 &UR; The author examines the Republican ``Conservative Moralist'' and
 &UR; ``Conservative Realist'' positions in the debate over the
 &UR; direction of American foreign policy.)
</P>
<P>
   The Great Foreign Policy Debate of 2000 is a cascade of ink not
limited to the battle of the journals. It has become a bonanza as
well for the publishing industry as authors from different research
institutes flood bookstores and libraries with their tomes.
</P>
<P>
   The most prestigious outlet for discussions of international
affairs is the bimonthly magazine ``Foreign Affairs,'' which
specializes in the disputations of diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment
for Peace, and his intellectual soul mate, Bill Kristol, editor of
the ``Weekly Standard'' journal, co-wrote an article in ``Foreign
Affairs''called ``Toward a Neo-Reaganite Foreign Policy,'' in which
they wrote: ``Finally, American foreign policy should be informed
with a clear moral purpose, based on the understanding that its
moral goals and its fundamental national interest are almost in
harmony . . . The remoralization of America at home ultimately
requires the remoralization of American foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   `GREAT FATHER FIGURE' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``History shows that democracies do not fight each other,''
writes Robert Kagan, who may be considered the leading advocate of
the Conservative Moralist congregation. ``American democracy should
be expansionary, and the U.S. should be more assertive and activist
in enlarging the frontiers of democracy around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take Ronald Reagan as the great father figure of American
foreign policy. Not only was Reagan skeptical of international
organizations, but he also understood the necessity for the U.S. to
act unilaterally and to intervene into the affairs of another
country on the grounds of American national interest. Reagan had an
intuitive grasp of hard power, or military force.''
</P>
<P>
   REALISM AND MORALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kagan traces his intellectual ancestry to Teddy Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I join realism and moralism,'' Kagan said, ``and so did Teddy
Roosevelt. Woodrow Wilson, for all his genius, even though he
desired to make the `world safe for democracy,' was willing to
sacrifice American sovereignty to a world government.
</P>
<P>
   ``TR (Teddy Roosevelt) would not have done that, but recognized
the need to use U.S. power unilaterally to spread American ideas
and values. Reagan was part of the TR (Roosevelt) tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ledeen, research fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, has published a book, ``Freedom Betrayed,'' that reads
like a hymn to the American system.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ledeen, the democratic revolution has passed
through two periods: The first was the American Revolution of 1776,
and the second is America in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A proselytizing Democrat, Ledeen attaches himself to the Wilson
who sought to ``make the world safe for democracy,'' and ``Freedom
Betrayed'' presents the United States as a revolutionary power, a
``chosen nation'' for converting the world to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATIC IMPERIALISM? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The dogma of Conservative Moralists is open to theological
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Kagan, Kristol and Ledeen abandon the principles of George
Kennan's ``containment policy'' through which America won the Cold
War. The containment policy was essentially a static program, for
it conformed to a bipolar world, and it assumed that both the
Soviet Union and the United States would remain on their sides of
the Iron Curtain, while Washington waited for the decay of
Stalinist Communist imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   The priesthood of Conservative Moralism wants to replace the
static nature of the containment policy with a form of democratic
imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that the post-Cold War world is a monopolar one in which
the United State is preeminent, that limits to American
expansionism no longer exist, this College of Cardinals seeks to
root the democratic flag in such far-away places as Azerbaijan,
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan (countries that few Americans even know
are on the map) _ all of which, not incidentally, are enormously
rich in oil and natural-gas deposits.
</P>
<P>
   These foreign-policy gurus have not proved their claim that
unilateral intervention into the affairs of a sovereign country is
an effective means of installing democracy in a nation. Government
through the consent of the people arises only when other supportive
institutions exist, such as a free press, an independent judiciary
and a population committed to the principles of civil rights, and
these cannot be imposed by paratroopers descending from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRACY OR CAPITALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, the prophets of Conservative Moralism do not clearly
indicate which they wish to export _ democracy or capitalism.
Michael Ledeen, however, does have the courage of his faith, for he
wishes to export the Reagan Republican Platform of 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Freedom Betrayed,''Ledeen defines the democratic
revolution: ``Today it means waging war against the growing power
of the preeminent modern institution: state bureaucracy . . That is
why the call to slash the size of government is such an integral
part of the democratic revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a difference between the American Constitution and
the Republican platform of 1980: Although it is patriotism to ask
American soldiers to fight for the Constitution, it is bottomless
greed to ask them to fight to imperialize the Reagan 1980 campaign
slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Wishing to position itself as the final arbiter of the Great
Debate, ``Foreign Affairs'' has devoted its January-February 2000
issue to the Republican side of this argument. In this issue,
Condoleezza Rice wrote the lead article, ``Promoting the National
Interest,'' an exposition of the Conservative Realist position. In
the March/April 2000 issue, ``Foreign Affairs''will follow up with
the Democratic response.
</P>
<P>
   NATION COMES FIRST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rice has deep roots in the Bush dynasty because she worked as a
Russian specialist on the National Security Council under President
Bush and presidential adviser Brent Scowcroft. A book by Bush and
Scowcroft, ``A World Transformed,'' refers to her as extremely
competent and knowledgeable.
</P>
<P>
   Re-emphasizing one of the major principles of Conservative
Realism, Rice upholds the primacy of national interest over
international organizations and norms. The theory of ``universal
human rights'' is a wonderful ideal, but here also national
interest takes priority over the banner of universal human rights.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of Russia, Rice supports the expansion of NATO to
include Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. The United States
should not be deterred by Russian anger because of the ballooning
of NATO into real estate once controlled by Soviet armies.
</P>
<P>
   The former Soviet specialist to Bush favors U.S. support for the
continued independence of the Ukraine and other countries in
Central Asia that seek to protect their sovereignty from Russian
control.
</P>
<P>
   REBUILD MILITARY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Caspian Sea region is of vital importance for U.S. interests
because of its huge oil and natural-gas reserves. In this region of
the globe, the policy of containing the Soviet Union is replaced by
the policy of dismembering Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Criticizing President Clinton for cutting the defense budget,
Rice wants to rebuild the military to throw out the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Russians and construct a
national missile-defense system. The defeat of the renewal of the
1992 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was correct. In the last
analysis, it is ``hard power,'' the persuasiveness of the bullet,
that determines the fate of nations.
</P>
<P>
   Rice favors U.S. participation in all international
organizations because such collaboration is an advantage to the
national interests of America.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she favors continued U.S. participation in the
World Trade Organization, because she favors opening markets for
U.S. exports. Trade is an important instrument of U.S. foreign
policy, and the international reduction of tariffs and other trade
barriers represents a gain to the United States because it helps
create an entrepreneurial capitalist class in whatever nation
becomes a partner in these commercial networks.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding trade with China, the former national security adviser
believes, is in American national self-interest because it will
speed economic liberalization, and the emergence of an aggressive
capitalist phalanx could act as the springboard for the sprouting
of political democracy. Unlike Clinton, however, Rice does not view
China as a ``strategic partner'' but as a ``strategic competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Realists want to maintain Taiwanese
independence, and they image themselves as the party of the right
on the China issue. In essence, they want to create an East Asian
``rollback theory'' in the style of John Foster Dulles, keeping
China out of Taiwan and forcing China out of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   CEASE BEING WORLD'S POLICE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From her new position at Stanford University, Rice launched has
her most spirited diatribes against the Clinton administration on
the question of humanitarian intervention. She points to the
failure of such action in Haiti and to the ineffectiveness of
multilateral humanitarian intervention in Somalia,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the United States exerts hard hegemonic power in the
world, it should not act as the earth's ``globocop.'' Rice does not
believe that it is within the national interest of the United
States to play the universal gendarme.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Rice an authoritative voice from the Conservative
Realist pew, but the probable ghostwriter on foreign policy for
Gov. George W. Bush. There is no difference in substance between
the Rice essay and a speech on America's position in the world that
Bush gave to kick off his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Jeane Kirkpatrick, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under
Reagan, agrees with Rice, particularly on the need to protect U.S.
sovereignty and to build an anti-ballistic missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am glad the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was defeated,''
Kirkpatrick confessed. ``I worked for five years at the U.N., and I
can tell you that votes in the General Assembly are often stampeded
and ill-informed. There are over 150 members in the General
Assembly, and the vast majority have no experience with nuclear
weapons, and so their votes are not based on fact or experience. It
is wrong to give such a body a literal veto over American
armaments, defense and national interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall discussing the issue of the anti-ballistic missile
defense system with Ronald Reagan. The president looked upon a
system which could prevent an attack as a moral imperative because
it would prevent incalculable carnage. He believed that the policy
of MAD _ mutually assured destruction _ was immoral because it left
open the possibility of attack and cataclysmic bloodshed. To be
able to deter such an attack was equal to defending against
unprecedented inhumanity.''
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN BEEFS UP HIS TEAM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain is also a member of the Conservative Realist
choir.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, McCain has added some illustrious names to his
foreign-policy team. Other notable foreign-policy sages now stand
alongside Henry Kissinger in the ex-Navy pilot's camp, and they
include Zbigniew Brzezinski, Larry Eagleberger, Kirkpatrick and R.
James Woolsey.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-prisoner of war also looks suspiciously upon mainland
China. Although McCain supports the maintainence of normal trade
relations with China, he looks upon that country of 1.2 billion
people as a rival to the United State in the Pacific Rim, and he
stands firmly for continued independence of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The November election will undoubtedly witness impassioned
disagreements over China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
China already enjoys most-favored-nation trading rights with the
United States and a mushrooming trade surplus.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA AT CENTER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Judging China as a potential adversary, McCain wants to link
membership in the World Trade Organization with domestic
liberalization in China. Rather than remain in a state of Clinton
self-denial, Conservative Realists want China to broaden universal
rights, grant religious freedom and cease political repression
before granting it equal representation in the trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether Bush or McCain becomes the GOP
presidential contender, China will become the center of gravity of
the foreign-policy debates. For most of the 12 years that
Republicans held the White House, from 1980 to 1992 under Reagan
and George Bush, the Cold War raged and Republicans looked tougher
on the Soviet Union than Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Evil Empire'' has disappeared, the bipolar world is a
theme of the past, but the Republicans have also suffered their
losses: They can no longer appear as the knights of anti-communism.
To reinvent their image as Sir Lancelot slaying the Red Dragon,
they are trying to paint Beijing as the Second KGB. Abiding by the
philosophy of ``Wag the Dog,'' if a war does not exist, then it is
necessary to invent one.

ECONOMISTS READJUST ESTIMATE OF OVERSTATEMENT OF INFLATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than three years after concluding that the
Consumer Price Index overstated inflation by 1.1 percentage points
a year, a group of prominent economists says changes made to the
index since then have narrowed the overstatement to about 0.8 a
percentage point a year.
</P>
<P>
   Their estimate is included in a report prepared for Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., by the General Accounting Office, which
conducts investigations and audits for Congress. The report is to
be released publicly on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The economists were the members of a commission established by
Congress to study the price index, which is widely used not just as
a barometer of inflation but to set wages in union agreements and
to recalculate tax brackets and Social Security benefits each year.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, headed by Michael J. Boskin of Stanford
University, spent 18 months studying the index. In December 1996,
the commission's five members reported that a variety of
statistical problems had created an upward bias in the price gauge
of between 0.8 and 1.6 percentage points annually, with their best
guess being 1.1 percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics
has made seven changes in the way it calculates the index. In a
letter accompanying the accounting office's report, Katharine G.
Abraham, the commissioner of labor statistics, said the agency was
continuing to develop and evaluate improvements to the index, but
that it did not think it possible to put a specific number on the
degree to which the index overstates inflation.
</P>
<P>
   At Moynihan's request, the accounting office went back to the
commission members and asked for their current estimates of the
upward bias in the index. In addition to Boskin, whose estimate was
0.8 to 0.85 percentage point, the other members were Ellen R.
Dulberger of IBM, who estimated 0.8 percentage points; Robert J.
Gordon of Northwestern University, who estimated 0.73 percentage
point; and Dale W. Jorgenson of Harvard, who estimated 0.9
percentage point. The fifth member of the commission, Zvi Griliches
of Harvard, died in November.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the ways in which the price index is used, even
modest reductions in any upward bias could result in smaller wage
increases for some workers, lower payments to Social Security
recipients and higher tax bills for some people.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan used the results to buttress his case for holding
cost-of- living increases for Social Security beneficiaries to a
rate below the rise in the Consumer Price Index. Such a change, he
said, would go far toward putting Social Security's finances on
sound footing for the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing the cost-of-living increases by eight-tenths of a
percentage point would eliminate more than half of Social
Security's projected shortfall over the next 75 years, Moynihan
said.
</P>
<P>
   In its original report, the Boskin commission said that the
overstatement of inflation in the price index stemmed from a
variety of problems. One was the inability of the index to fully
capture decisions by consumers to switch from one variety of a
product to another when prices rise _ from Red Delicious to Granny
Smith apples, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Another was the difficulty of accounting for choices by
consumers to avoid rising prices by switching from one type of
product to another _ renting a video, for example, rather than
going out to see a movie.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest single problem identified by the commission was
adding popular new products like computer and cell phones to the
index soon enough after their introduction to capture declines in
their prices, and to find a way of accounting for quality
improvements.

THE DAZZLING TREASURES AMASSED BY THE SULTANS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 5) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ There is bad news for anyone planning to
visit Turkey this year. The velvet-lined case that houses the
country's most famous artifact, the glittering Topkapi dagger, will
be empty.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will visitors be able to see the curved battle sword that
hung from Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror's hip when his army captured
Constantinople in 1453, or the inlaid ebony-and-ivory throne from
which the vast Ottoman Empire was once ruled, or the dazzling
emerald-studded turban decoration that awed visitors to the court
of Sultan Ahmed I in the 17th century.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, however, is that these objects and more than 200
others, some of which have never before left the Topkapi Palace,
will be missing because they will be on tour through the United
States. They are part of one of the most ambitious exhibitions of
Ottoman treasures ever assembled.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, called ``Palace of Gold and Light: Treasures
From the Topkapi, Istanbul,'' opened on Wednesday at the Corcoran
Gallery of Art in Washington and is to travel to museums in San
Diego and Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ottoman art has great variety because it draws on so many
different cultures and aesthetic approaches,'' said Tulay Artan, a
history professor at Sabanci University in Istanbul and curator of
the exhibition. ``The Ottoman Empire was an umbrella for a very
diverse group of peoples, and the palace became an umbrella for all
sorts of artists. Their sensibilities blended together, and Ottoman
art became a distinct style that is immediately recognizable. It
isn't well known in the West because it's not represented in most
Western museums. That's what should make this exhibition so
interesting for American audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   The Topkapi Palace was once the seat of some of the world's most
enticing mysteries. Its inner courtyards and pavilions, which only
a handful of highly privileged lords and ladies were allowed to
enter, were the stuff of countless fantasies in Europe and beyond.
They were both the political heart of a great empire and the home
of concubines about whose sensuality outsiders dreamed for
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Built in the 15th century, the Topkapi stands high atop a bluff
overlooking the southern end of the Bosporus, with panoramic views
of Asia and Europe. It is a walled complex that housed not only the
famous harems and their royal masters, but also thousands of
courtiers, bureaucrats, diplomats and teachers, not to mention
hundreds of cooks, bakers, confectioners and other servants.
</P>
<P>
   It boasted elaborate and fragrant gardens, a menagerie of exotic
animals, and even a fountain where the royal executioner could wash
his sword and hands after decapitations, flanked by two marble
niches where the severed heads were sometimes displayed.
</P>
<P>
   The Topkapi's intricate chambers were decorated with an
exquisite skill that reflected a highly developed aesthetic sense
while also conveying the grandeur of Ottoman power. Many outsiders
who were permitted to enter came away deeply moved and impressed.
That was hardly surprising; during campaigns of conquest that
spread Ottoman rule over much of Arabia, Persia, North Africa and
southern and eastern Europe, commanders were under orders to find
the most skilled craftsmen in captured lands and send them to the
Topkapi.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many palaces in other lands where objects of beauty were
assembled, the Topkapi was never sacked by conquerors or otherwise
pillaged. It remained the residence of sultans until the 19th
century, when they finally moved to more modern palaces along the
Bosporus. Later it was turned into a museum displaying the finest
work of Ottoman artists and craftsmen.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition that is now coming to the United States includes
more of these items than have ever been shown outside the Topkapi
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the best known, although by no means most artistically
significant, is the celebrated dagger. Part of its modern fame
comes from its central role in the 1964 film ``Topkapi,'' a minor
classic of the caper genre starring Maximilian Schell, Peter
Ustinov and Melina Mercouri. In it, thieves sought unsuccessfully
to steal the dagger by lowering themselves from a skylight. Its
true history is as exciting as any film.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The dagger was not originally meant to be kept at the Topkapi at
all. It was made in 1747 as a gift from the sultan to a Persian
shah, and few objects have so successfully conveyed one monarch's
regard for another. The scabbard is mother-of-pearl, gilded and
decorated with rows of diamonds. Three enormous emeralds shine from
its handle and a fourth, set into the top and cut into an octagon,
conceals a small timepiece.
</P>
<P>
   As the caravan carrying this extraordinary gift made its way
toward the shah's court, shocking news arrived: the intended
recipient had been overthrown and killed. The caravan turned back,
and the dagger was placed in the royal treasury. Today many
visitors to Istanbul consider it a prime attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Other items in the exhibition are grouped to convey aspects of
life in the Topkapi. Several are connected with the conquest of
Constantinople (now Istanbul), which was a turning point in world
history.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most fascinating is a talismanic shirt that Mehmet
the Conqueror wore under his armor. It suggests that he may have
been something other than an orthodox Muslim, and indeed John
Freely, an authority on life at the palace, writes that ``he seems
to have been basically irreligious, and in his observance of Islam
he merely observed the forms of the Muslim faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Other objects are ceremonial pieces meant to suggest the
empire's strength and magnificence. They include ornately
embroidered caftans, military equipment and banners as well as
books bound with precious metals and gems. Ceremonial seals, keys,
scales and writing sets reflect administrative aspects of life in
the Topkapi.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the most beautiful objects come from the palace's inner
sanctums. Among them are superb examples of the wall tiles and
calligraphic panels that awed outsiders and still influence popular
taste in many parts of the world. Other items, like a pencil box
that is almost entirely covered with jewels, reflect the luxury of
daily life inside the palace.
</P>
<P>
   There are also fine works of Chinese porcelain, samples from a
rich collection that reflects the sultans' fascination with arts
and crafts from distant places.
</P>
<P>
   One of the books included in the exhibition is a register of
artisans who worked at the palace. It shows the variety of arts and
crafts that the sultans prized, for among those on salary were
scribes, illuminators, painters, bookbinders, furriers, weavers,
musical instrument makers, armorers, woodworkers, carpet designers,
goldsmiths, embroiderers, glaziers, tile makers and even
specialists in making incense-burning vessels. The book is
displayed along with examples of the work these masters produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first exhibition to focus on the Topkapi and to
address the questions of what an Islamic palace was, how it worked
and how it integrated the arts,'' said Walter Denny, a professor of
art history at the University of Massachusetts who is an adviser to
the exhibition organizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of its most interesting aspects is that it focuses quite a
bit of attention on Sultan Mehmet, who with all due respect to
Suleiman the Magnificent and several others was really the most
compelling, the most interesting, the most terrifying and at the
same time most fascinating of all the Ottoman sultans.
</P>
<P>
   But it also brings together a whole spectrum of objects that
show the delicacy, the sophistication, the marvelous complexity,
the subtlety and the fantastic beauty of Ottoman art.''

EDITORIAL: BUSH'S VIRGINIA COMEBACK  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, March 1:
</P>
<P>
   With his sweep in Virginia, Gov. George W. Bush's troubled
presidential campaign has wrung an essential victory from a
reliably conservative state. But once again Sen. John McCain
pointed up the soft spot in Bush's candidacy by drawing majority
support among independents, moderates and Democratic crossovers.
Bush's partisans would argue, though, that in challenging religious
fundamentalists' pivotal role in the nominating process, McCain is
appealing to a fantasy version of the Republican Party. For that
reason, the Virginia results set up a tremendously important
showdown in the March 7 ``Super Tuesday'' primaries. The
battleground states of California and Ohio, where Bush leads, and
in New York, which is a toss-up, may well determine whether McCain
will be remembered as a transforming or a transitory figure in the
GOP.
</P>
<P>
   For the Democrats, Washington state, with its later vote count,
will be analyzed as an important test of whether former Sen. Bill
Bradley can continue. A victory there, or even a close race against
Vice President Al Gore, might revive Bradley's chances in New York
and California. But a bad defeat could feed pressures on him to
withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   For both parties, Tuesday's voting set the stage for a more
nationalized phase of the nominating process. Republicans
everywhere are wondering whether McCain's daring attempt to
redefine his party is an act of historic farsightedness or
self-destruction. The party's establishment is working hard to push
Bush to the nomination, and his Virginia win will restore their
wavering faith. But they are not yet sure whether to ignore
McCain's disturbing message that catering to religious
conservatives is becoming an outdated strategy, especially outside
the Sun Belt.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's success so far has arisen from his ability to set the
terms of the debate. To that end, it was smart of him to reverse
his decision to skip the final debate before the March 7 round of
primaries. By agreeing to participate from a live hookup in New
York, McCain shores up his support in New York and the New England
states that vote on Super Tuesday. McCain's future may depend on
how much strength he shows in those states, given Bush's expected
appeal in the Southern states voting that day.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia, a keystone state of the GOP's Sun Belt base, took
regional revenge on McCain for his attacks on Pat Robertson, Jerry
Falwell, Bob Jones University and other icons of the religious
right. McCain wants his party to hold the votes of Bible Belt
Republicans without following their every dictate on policy. In
that sense, he was betting that sacrificing Virginia to Bush would
strengthen him in the more diverse and moderate Republican states
that vote next week. Tuesday, to be sure, belonged to Bush as the
undisputed champion of the voter blocs that have dominated the GOP
for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   With the lines so clearly drawn, no one will have trouble
reading the results over the next two weeks. McCain must hope his
party is ready for a more moderate and inclusive kind of
conservatism than the one that gave Bush his victory in Virginia.

CARNIVAL IS A GOOD IDEA FOR ALL OF US  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 5) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JON PARELES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Carnival dances in this weekend across the Caribbean, South
America, southern Europe and that splendid cultural biosphere, New
Orleans. From now through Fat Tuesday, carnival's first paradox is
that it ties profane delights to the church calendar, wrapping up
before Lent begins on Ash Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, real men are wearing feathers and sequins,
making public spectacles of themselves in costumes that take weeks
or months of work but will vanish in a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Giant parade bands are massing in the streets, resurrected
annually by volunteer, amateur musicians who casually execute grand
feats of memory and coordination. Whole musical repertories, with
old songs and new, are heard only while the season lasts, among
them sambas, calypsos and the funky war chants of Mardi Gras
Indians in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival's miraculous outpouring of creativity, in thousands
upon thousands of individual choices to sew a costume or join a
steel-drum orchestra or parade through the center of town, is
enough to make those of us in more temperate zones feel culturally
deprived. Carnival would be good for all of us.
</P>
<P>
   The singular joy of carnival isn't in the mass public
inebriation or flashes of skin; you can find those at spring break
in Florida. It's not merely a parade, a costumed ball, a concert,
dancing in the street, or all of them combined. Nor is it an
entertainment that can be simply imported or commissioned.
</P>
<P>
   Although many carnival bands sound great all by themselves _ and
time-tested carnival rhythms are the secret ingredient in all sorts
of dance music _ they're better when everyone is singing along.
Carnival means more because it has traditions forged in a long
history of paradoxical balancing acts, a gradually negotiated
covenant between authority and rebellion, rich and poor, pagan and
devout.
</P>
<P>
   With the continuity of a ritual, carnival gives people a
connection to the past; it's no accident that carnival songs, like
African griot songs, are full of reminders about history. And in
the present, carnival is an exuberantly stylized celebration of
everyone learning to get along.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly in places where Roman Catholic colonialists met
native and African cultures, carnival is a piquant, living memory
of past frictions and ingenious adaptations. As a public outlet for
impulses that are suppressed in ordinary life, carnival was, and
still is, a pressure valve for the frustrations of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   For the length of the masquerade, trappings of everyday class
and status are upended; men can become women, children can become
princes and empresses, workers can be demons or clergy or animals.
It is also, in the humorous but sometimes biting satirical songs
that are part of many carnivals, a way for those frustrations to be
aired publicly without reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, in places where slaves were imported, carnival has
been a covert survival and transmission mechanism for old,
African-derived rhythms. All that cultural sedition is masked as
nothin' but a party.
</P>
<P>
   The parade groups that appear for carnival season are community
organizations as much as performing ensembles. Preparing for
carnival _ designing and making the costumes, rehearsing the music
_ involves hundreds and sometimes thousands of people in a project
that is anything but frivolous.
</P>
<P>
   It's a symbol of perseverance and teamwork, of shared memory and
neighborhood pride, along with meanings that aren't necessarily
clear to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the most visible and enduring carnival
groups are the Mardi Gras Indians of New Orleans, groups like the
Wild Magnolias and the Golden Eagles who parade in the city's
uptown neighborhoods. They started making their meticulously beaded
and expansively feathered costumes a century ago, when poor blacks
were exposed to Buffalo Bill's Wild West shows and saw the Indians
as fellow rebels against white domination.
</P>
<P>
   Long ago, groups of Indians used to have street fights on Mardi
Gras morning. Now their songs, with syncopations that found their
way into New Orleans jazz and rhythm-and-blues, still allude to
battles, but the tribes don't get any more physical than dancing.
</P>
<P>
   New York doesn't entirely lack carnival; we just get it later,
off the liturgical calendar. Every Labor Day weekend brings the
West Indian-American carnival in Brooklyn, which draws a million
spectators to a magnificent homemade sequel to the carnivals of
Trinidad and Tobago and the other English-speaking Caribbean
islands. But it's a transplanted carnival tradition, not an
indigenous one; it looks back to the West Indies.
</P>
<P>
   New York's annual Halloween parade in Greenwich Village also has
a strong element of carnival with its eye-popping and sometimes
politically motivated costumes. But neither event produces songs
the whole city will sing.
</P>
<P>
   That's what carnival-deprived places lack most: street songs. In
carnival cities, a song can sweep through an entire populace for
the season. Trinidad has turned the process into a contest, giving
an annual award for the Road March, the song heard most often on
the streets of its capital, Port of Spain, during carnival. (Lord
Kitchener, who died on Feb. 11, was Trinidad's king of the Road
March, winning the award 10 times between 1963 and 1976.)
</P>
<P>
   A carnival season's conquering street song might well be a
celebration of the pleasures of the flesh, a pre-Lenten indulgence
that turns lewd come-ons into a light-hearted singalong. It could
also be a thinly veiled outlet for public discontent, with
double-entendres that seem transparent to everyone except the
potentially offended authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a carnival for every locality, as neighbors turned down
boomboxes to sing along with neighbors, and even miscreants
couldn't resist humming the tune that denounces them. With
carnival, there'd be a party in party politics.

CAP GEMINI WILL BUY ERNST &AMP; YOUNG'S CONSULTING BUSINESS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ In a move to create a global computer services
consulting firm, Cap Gemini SA of France announced Tuesday that it
is acquiring the consulting practice of Ernst &AMP; Young, one of the
world's largest accounting firms, in a deal worth $11.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Cap Gemini said it will pay 375 million euros, or $362 million,
in cash and issue up to 43.5 million new shares, if all the
consulting businesses of Ernst &AMP; Young accept the offer.
</P>
<P>
   The stock will be divided among Ernst &AMP; Young's 1,000 consulting
partners, who will now work for Cap Gemini, and the 4,000
accounting and tax partners that will remain with the auditing
firm. About a third of the shares will go to the consulting
partners and another third to the accounting and tax partners, who
must sell their stock within five years. The remainder will go to
fund Ernst &AMP; Young's pension plan and to pay for a variety of other
expenses, including tax bills and transaction costs.
</P>
<P>
   The deal represents the latest attempt by the accounting
industry to try to address competitive pressures facing consultants
and to allay regulators' concerns about the integrity of corporate
audits. If it succeeds, it will be the first time one of the
largest accounting firms has sold its major consulting business and
will afford Cap Gemini, the biggest European computer services
company, a major entry into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hermelin, a Cap Gemini director, said the combined
companies were ``transforming Cap Gemini into a real global firm.''
Combined revenue, he said at a news conference to announce the
deal, will amount to as much as $7.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Philip A. Laskawy, chairman and chief executive of Ernst &AMP; Young
who will remain at the head of the auditing practice, said both
companies complemented one another ``from a strategic and
geographic perspective,'' and are equally committed ``to the
development of e-offerings.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the world's biggest accounting firms have come
under growing pressure to separate their accounting and consulting
businesses. The latter has become their most profitable and
fastest-growing area, but friction between consultants and
accountants has grown. The consulting business requires
significantly more capital than the firm's traditional auditing
practice, and firms have scrambled to retain and attract their
consulting employees.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission has also been pressuring
firms to avoid the conflicts of interest that come when supposedly
independent auditors are tempted to make compromises in reviewing a
company's books rather than risk losing lucrative consulting
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, PricewaterhouseCoopers, which advises and
audits many of the world's biggest corporations, said it plans to
separate its auditing and consulting practices into two or more
separate entities. Its biggest rivals, including KPMG, Arthur
Andersen and Deloitte &AMP; Touche, are all trying to devise other
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   While the sale by Ernst &AMP; Young represents a possible answer to
the problem of auditor independence, the transaction has not yet
been approved by the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst &AMP; Young's audit partners will still own a sizable piece of
Cap Gemini, and regulators may view the arrangement as one that
continues to pose a conflict of interest for the firm's auditors.
</P>
<P>
   The move will catapult Cap Gemini into the big league of global
computer service consultants, a field now dominated by American
giants like IBM, EDS, Andersen Consulting and Computer Sciences.
Pierre Hessler, president of Gemini Consulting, said he expected
the combined group to generate roughly a fourth of its revenue from
Internet companies this year, up from about 16 percent in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will also strengthen Cap Gemini's position in the
United States, which will account for about a third of the group's
revenue, and reinforce its status in Germany, another major market.
</P>
<P>
   But some industry observers say Cap Gemini may face a challenge
in keeping Ernst &AMP; Young's clients happy. In the United States, Cap
Gemini's image was bruised recently after several major computer
installations failed to live up to expectations. In January, the
company reached an amicable settlement with the United Way of
America over a failed $12 million project; last summer, the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce canceled a $75 million contract with Cap
Gemini, contending that one of its systems failed to deliver what
was promised.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cap Gemini's bid would create a consulting giant with a
strong position in the financial and insurance industries, but also
in the media and telecommunications businesses. Analysts said the
combination makes sense, given Cap Gemini's strong presence in
Europe, while Ernst &AMP; Young has a solid position in the United
States and Germany, a European market where Cap Gemini has
struggled to develop a significant presence.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the alliance enables both companies to better service
the Internet economy, which is enjoying sustained growth and strong
profitability.

   Investors appeared to agree. Cap Gemini's share price soared
almost 14 percent at the start of trading in Paris Tuesday, to a
record 291.9 euros, or $283.14. The price has risen almost 50
percent since early December, when the companies began serious
talks.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with Cap Gemini involves its consulting practices in
the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and
Spain, countries where Ernst &AMP; Young generates roughly 85 percent
of its total consulting revenue of $3.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries are expected to be included later, including
Belgium, the Netherlands, much of Scandinavia, Australia and New
Zealand. The deal requires the approval of Ernst &AMP; Young partners,
who will vote country by country in coming weeks. The results are
expected in April. Cap Gemini shareholders must then approve the
arrangement.

 &HT;    Autopsy report: Crowd attacked Atlanta slaying victims
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two men stabbed to death in a melee hours after the
Super Bowl were attacked by as many as 10 people, according to
autopsy reports released Tuesday by the Fulton County Medical
Examiner's Office.
</P>
<P>
   One of the slain men sustained a 4-inch-long cut across his
abdomen, the autopsy found.
</P>
<P>
   The reports, which describe how Jacinth Baker and Richard Lollar
died at an Atlanta intersection, also indicates the two Decatur,
Ga., men may have been stabbed with two different knives.
</P>
<P>
   Lollar's wounds show he was stabbed with a knife that has a
serrated edge, while Baker's wounds showed no evidence of
serration, said Dr. John Parker, an assistant Fulton County medical
examiner.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could mean they were stabbed with different knives or the
identical knives were used but the angle may have been different,''
said Parker, who performed the autopsies.
</P>
<P>
   The reports, obtained Tuesday by The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, show Lollar was stabbed and sliced four times
and died of a 3- or 3 1/2-inch-deep wound to the heart. Baker was
stabbed three times and died of a 3-inch-deep wound that penetrated
the heart. A 4-inch-long, 3-inch-deep abdominal cut penetrated his
liver.
</P>
<P>
   Baker also suffered bruises to his face, forehead and nose.
Parker said that was consistent with falling on the pavement after
he was attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Ravens football star Ray Lewis, Reginald Oakley and
Joseph Sweeting have all been indicted on murder charges. Lewis is
out of jail on bail and is under a court-supervised curfew in
Maryland; the other two are jailed in Atlanta awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   Neither District Attorney Paul Howard nor Atlanta police would
say Tuesday whether they were seeking more arrests in the case,
citing a gag order.
</P>
<P>
   Medical examiner's investigators, who arrived at the scene
shortly after police, interviewed witnesses and prepared a report
on each victim that is attached as part of the medical examiner's
autopsy report.
</P>
<P>
   Investigator Teresa R. Price said witnesses told her that ``10
men jumped on the two men and stabbed and shot at'' Lollard and
Baker, her report shows.
</P>
<P>
   No one has since alleged that shots were fired at Baker and
Lollar, although shots reportedly were fired at the limousine after
the altercation.
</P>
<P>
   Price's report that more than three people fought with Lollar
and Baker is consistent with what cabdriver Patrick I. Ozonu, a
witness to part of the incident, told the Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I saw was six guys beating up a guy, right at the
intersection,'' Ozonu said. ``There was a commotion. Six people
were beating up one guy _ but there was a commotion. That means it
could have been more people, more than six.''
</P>
<P>
   And only a few hours after the killings, Lollar's fiancee,
Kellye Smith, told the Journal-Constitution, an undercover Atlanta
police investigator who had been working near the fight scene told
her he had seen 10 people fighting with Baker and Lollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he yelled out, `There's 10 on two,''' Smith said.
``He said he thought of trying to get into the fight to help, but
then thought better of it because there were so many people.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Atlanta police investigators and one of Lewis'
attorneys, Ed Garland, said at least 12 people had been riding in
the Lincoln Navigator stretch limousine Lewis rented to party in
Atlanta during the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers included Lewis, driver Duane Fassett, Oakley,
Sweeting and two women.
</P>
<P>
   At Lewis' bond hearing, police Investigator Ken Allen said
Sweeting and Lewis went to the Sports Authority in Duluth, Ga.,
during the weekend and Sweeting purchased three knives.
</P>
<P>
   Police have said that at least one of the knives Sweeting
purchased was a small folding knife that attaches to the index
finger. The only knife fitting that description at the Sports
Authority is the Gerber Chameleon II. The knife is partially
serrated.
</P>
<P>
   The plastic package that holds the $20 knife is emblazoned with
the words ``For all your adventures'' on the front.

 &HT;    Water war negotiators try to pump life into talks
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Negotiators in Georgia's rancorous water war with
Alabama and Florida tried desperately to break their impasse
Tuesday _ agreeing to make a last-ditch effort on one front and to
aim lower on a second.
</P>
<P>
   In one of two negotiating sessions in Atlanta, deliberators for
Georgia and Alabama agreed to hold one more session this month to
try to keep alive talks to share the waters of the Alabama, Coosa
and Tallapoosa rivers, or the ACT.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gasping for air,'' Alabama's chief negotiator Jim
Campbell said of the stalled talks. He said Georgia's refusal to
budge on water allocations for the ACT means it may be useless for
the two states to continue bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   In a second session, arbitrators for Georgia, Alabama and
Florida made little headway in reaching an agreement to share the
waters of the Apalachicola, Chattahoochee and Flint rivers, or the
ACF.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the prospect of a complete breakdown in the talks,
negotiators for Georgia and Florida said that instead of aiming for
a 50-year agreement, they might consider an interim water-sharing
formula for only seven to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   That could mean recasting flow targets for the rivers. Alabama
would have to agree to any plan the other states came up with, and
there is no guarantee the states could eventually reach even a
short-term settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Both disputes could end up in the U.S. Supreme Court, where it
could take millions of dollars and years to settle, and in the end,
no state may get what it wants.
</P>
<P>
   In the ACT feud, Georgia has promised that water flowing from
the basin into Alabama would never dip below a certain minimum at
the state line, even during severe droughts. Alabama wants higher
flows, but Georgia negotiators say those demands would draw down
Lake Allatoona and Carter's Lake in North Georgia to dangerously
low levels.
</P>
<P>
   The two states' negotiators agreed to take the matter to their
respective governors during the next two weeks to see if they want
the talks to continue or close. The arbitrators then will meet in
another session this month to determine if the talks have a future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be the last meeting of the ACT,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman already has expressed
his sentiments in a letter released last month: If Georgia does not
loosen its stance, ``we will see them in court.''
</P>
<P>
   In the battle over the ACF, Florida wants more water from
Georgia at the state line than Georgia is willing to deliver during
droughts. Alabama also wants more water, to support its growth.
</P>
<P>
   Working out a shorter-term agreement would give the states time
to develop more scientific data and complete an intensive study of
irrigation practices in southwest Georgia. Then the negotiators
would come back to the bargaining table and hash out a longer term
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The states have until May 1 to reach a settlement on both
disputes.

WHEN MUSIC, NOT METHOD, MATTERS MOST  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 5) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pierre Boulez's four concerts with the London Symphony Orchestra
at Carnegie Hall in Manhattan beginning on Friday are, in their
way, the closing of a book. The title of this book might be ``An
Age of Exploration,'' and we have been turning its pages for about
100 years.
</P>
<P>
   There will be new pieces by Salvatore Sciarrino, Peter Eotvos,
Olga Neuwirth and George Benjamin, but none will offer
groundbreaking methodology or send music into some unexplored
orbit. They will make sounds, maneuver in time and hope that we
like what we hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discovery'' will apply only in that each piece will have an
unexplored life of its own. Terms like ``vanguard'' or
``manifesto'' are not likely to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   The book being closed concerns the most political century in
musical memory. Music's politicians laid out their platforms and
trolled for votes of confidence cast by new composers. How would
they write music of the future? What direction promised rescue from
chaos? Who or what was to guide them?
</P>
<P>
   Tonal music ran out of room. Its hold on our ears was (and still
is) as strong as in the days of Haydn and Mozart, but key
relationships and harmonic progressions were worn and stretched to
such extremes of ambiguity that they were about to break apart.
Composers, furthermore, couldn't see much up ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss and Mahler just kept on stretching. Stravinsky brought a
sublimated savagery from his Russian origins and, with a mercurial
eclecticism, relived older styles in a completely new voice. When
Schoenberg composed ``Moses und Aron,'' everyone knew which role
was played by the composer, a man who would lead music to the
promised land along a road laid out by him alone.
</P>
<P>
   Revolution led to trends that hardened into schools and ended in
factions. Much of the postwar era was taken up with bickering over
who had the right idea. American universities, flush with money and
holding the powers of tenure and promotion, attracted the serialism
crowd to their faculties.
</P>
<P>
   Members, now with steady jobs, didn't have to care whether the
public hated their music or not. Opposing views were either shut
out, laughed to scorn or both. Later, when teaching posts dried up
and composers needed audiences again, the agility of all those
quick descents from various ivory towers was a sight to see.
</P>
<P>
   Once many years ago, when I expressed a love of Neo-Classical
Stravinsky to my teacher in Vienna, she, a rabid follower of the
Darmstadt Festival and its cult of experiment, dismissed me: ``This
is 1960. You travel by airplane, not by horse and buggy.'' The
words have stuck with me because they explain a musical age when
first on the minds of most musicians was not what one composed but
how one composed. The nobility of the music lay less in the
sentiment than in the originality and rectitude of the language.
</P>
<P>
   The other composers chosen for these four concerts were indeed
explorers in their time. But just as tonality seemed to be wearing
out a century ago, so, too, is the present search for doctrines and
messiahs.
</P>
<P>
   The march of history is enjoying a breather. Schoenberg (twice),
Berg, Bartok, Mahler and Stravinsky are being scheduled along with
Boulez's ``Originel'' from ``... explosante-fixe ...'' and the
Ligeti Violin Concerto. A lot of these items are closer to the
start of the 20th century than to the end. Now we call them
``modern classics,'' a little oxymoronic, but a workable
description.
</P>
<P>
   Could we possibly be at a new stage in concertgoing, where
cognoscenti enter the hall, pick up the program and groan, ``Not
Berg's Three Pieces for Orchestra again''? Believers in the
posterity syndrome (products of lonely garrets destined for
posthumous glory), of course, would be ecstatic, but I wonder
whether any amount of exposure will bring ``... explosante-fixe
...'' to your local elevator or to the lips of singers in the
shower.
</P>
<P>
   The gulf between art music and popular culture has become too
wide. Music in the concert hall once grew naturally out of popular
styles, but no longer.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance for concerts like these, on the other hand, has
surprised a lot of us this season. This public, moreover, seems
interested in Schoenberg's ``Pelleas und Melisande'' and the Piano
Concerto less for their historical groundbreaking than simply for
what they are.
</P>
<P>
   It is also interesting that the spiritual biography of the
conductor for these events is remarkably like the things that he
will be conducting. The young Boulez was impatient with the old,
suspicious of a lot of newness and quick to tell us that the method
mattered, and mattered very much.
</P>
<P>
   Boulez at 75 has become a composer of severe yet very beautiful
musical textures and less a maker of doctrine. As a conductor he
has opened himself to a wide and inclusive repertory; the
thought-driven young musician has become an interpreter of
surprising warmth.
</P>
<P>
   With Schoenberg, Stravinsky, Debussy, Boulez, Hindemith, Cage
and the Minimalists running off in their different directions, the
Tower of Babel has emerged as the telling 20th-century metaphor:
many languages, no lingua franca as yet.
</P>
<P>
   But let's try another image. Think of all these composers as
budding, if frustrated, Mercators. Terra incognita cried out for
map makers, and maybe that is what these concerts bring us: a
series of navigational charts that disagree on routes and
topography, and lead to no one place in particular. Audiences would
do well to forget all the possible destinations and simply
contemplate the beauty of the draftsmanship.

STATE FINES HOSPITAL, CITING BOTCHED BRAIN SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The state Department of Health cited Staten Island
University Hospital on Tuesday for 40 violations and fined the
hospital $80,000 for failing to monitor and discipline its chief of
neurosurgery, who the state said had operated on the wrong side of
a patient's brain for the second time in five years.
</P>
<P>
   The state's action was the harshest penalty and stiffest fine it
had imposed on a hospital in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the neurosurgeon, Dr. Ehud Arbit, bungled a cranial
procedure on a severely ill Staten Island patient who then died,
Health Commissioner Antonia C. Novello announced at a news
conference Tuesday. Arbit was fired from Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Hospital in 1995 for operating on the wrong side of a patient's
brain after confusing two patients.
</P>
<P>
   While the state investigation did not conclude that Arbit's
surgery caused the death of the Staten Island patient, it said that
one other patient of his had died after a questionable procedure,
and that others had become disabled. In several instances, the
state said, the hospital did not report any of the medical errors,
as it is required to do, and violated several provisions of New
York's health laws.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the fine, which the state said could not be
appealed, Novello ordered the Staten Island hospital to hire an
outside consultant to monitor the quality of care there.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital issued a statement Tuesday, in which it said it had
cooperated with state investigators and would work to improve its
monitoring system, in neurosurgery and throughout the hospital. It
said it was preparing a line-by-line response to the state's
findings.
</P>
<P>
   Arbit's lawyer, Anthony Scher, said Tuesday night, ``There was
an investigation into this issue and it is absolutely clear that he
did not operate on the wrong side of the brain. I have not seen the
state report, but it seems to me that they also understand that
that is not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of Arbit's colleagues said in interviews that he had
been unfairly maligned by other hospital workers as a result of
political battles within the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The state began its investigation after receiving several
complaints, and issued its findings Tuesday in a strongly worded
23-page report outlining many allegations, all stemming from
surgical procedures performed by Arbit.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found that Arbit and the hospital failed to
prepare for surgery properly. The state also cited the hospital for
its decision to allow physicians' assistants to take critical roles
during surgery, performing duties that the state said should have
been done by doctors. In one case, the state charged, Arbit sought
the medical advice of an equipment salesman for spinal plates
during an operation that was going badly. (The salesman, who was
observing the surgery, declined to answer.)
</P>
<P>
   Novello's investigators also outlined, in charge by charge,
gruesome details of what it said were botched operations. In the
case involving surgery on the wrong side of the brain, state
investigators found that a 54-year-old patient, with multiple
illnesses including brain and lung tumors, liver disease, diabetes
and pancreatitis, went into the operating room. The state report
said the patient's CAT scans were not brought into the operating
room, and that Arbit made an incision on the left cerebellum, only
to be told by a physician's assistant that she recalled the tumor
was on the right side.
</P>
<P>
   Arbit told state health investigators that he had intended all
along to remove the entire back of the skull, and that the side of
the placement of the first incision did not matter. He asserted
that he followed acceptable neurosurgical standards, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   The patient, identified by those familiar with the case as
Johnnie Artis, a security supervisor from Staten Island, fell into
a coma and died on Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from that case, the most serious allegation in the state's
report involved treatment of a 21-year-old patient, who suffered
from a brain tumor and was left to bleed excessively, the state
said. The doctor had used a device that others complained produced
a fuzzy, unusable image, the state said. He switched from
performing a biopsy to brain surgery, catching other staff
off-guard and ill prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Because the anesthesiologist had not anticipated more than a
biopsy, the patient's blood was not typed, and he had not prepared
to replace large quantities of blood, the report noted. A second
procedure was necessary to stop the bleeding, the state said. ``The
patient was unresponsive after surgery and died several weeks
later,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Another case involved a patient requiring spinal surgery. An
anesthesiologist and a physician's assistant told Department of
Health investigators that Arbit's hand slipped and lacerated the
patient's spinal cord, leaving her partially paralyzed, according
to the state's report. In another instance, the doctor and his
staff failed to perform proper follow-up blood work on a
62-year-old patient, exposing her to high risk when she underwent
additional surgery, the state found.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the case involving the equipment salesman, a patient
complained of weakness in her hands after an operation. A CAT scan
revealed loose screws on a plate that had been implanted in the
patient's spine along the back of the neck, the state noted. Arbit
failed to replace the screws properly, the state said, at one point
asking a medical equipment salesman in the operating room whether
he thought the plate was positioned correctly, the investigators
found.
</P>
<P>
   These medical errors so disturbed the hospital's chief
neurosurgery anesthesiologist that he refused to work with Arbit
and complained to hospital officials, who declined to take action,
the state said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the state rebuked the hospital for failing to report
these cases and for failing to deal with them properly in internal
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our investigation found an alarmingly high number of
deficiencies in the hospital's controls and procedures that need to
be in place to ensure patients receive proper care,'' Novello said.
``Worse yet,'' she added, the hospital failed to notify the state
of any worrisome cases, nor did it move to discipline the doctor or
properly investigate the cases when alerted of them.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, Staten Island University Hospital officials
said they would begin instituting new monitoring procedures to
ensure patient safety and quality of care within the next few days.
But the hospital cautioned that the state's Office of Professional
Medical Conduct, which licenses physicians in the state and
disciplines doctors, had yet to complete interviews with all
personnel involved or to finish its investigation of Arbit.
</P>
<P>
   Novello's announcement Tuesday of stiff fines and a slew of
health violations underscored her decision to make the disciplining
of doctors and quality of care monitoring at hospitals a hallmark
of her tenure, which began in June. For instance, the state of New
York had only twice suspended a doctor's license before an
investigation was completed, both times on Novello's watch and both
in the last few months.
</P>
<P>
   Arbit surrendered his license on Feb. 18. The other doctor who
surrendered his license while being investigated was Dr. Allan
Zarkin, who admitted to carving his initials into the stomach of a
patient on whom he had performed a Caesarean section last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Novello's tough stance comes at a time when President Clinton is
pressing states to adopt strict regulations for reporting medical
errors, after a recent report that found medical errors kills
hundreds of thousands of people each year. ``I want to be perfectly
clear,'' Novello said Tuesday. ``When and if the Department of
Health finds that a hospital is not operating up to high standards,
we will move swiftly and decisively.''
</P>
<P>
   The state began its investigation into Staten Island University
Hospital on Feb. 9, when it received complaints that Arbit had
operated on the wrong side of Artis' brain. When state
investigators contacted the hospital, Novello said, its
administrators told them, ``it was a rumor,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The state made an unannounced visit to the hospital the next
day, during which several hospital staff members volunteered
information about the surgeries, Novello said. A week later,
investigators returned and found corroborating evidence, she said.
On Friday, the state concluded its ``intensive investigation'' into
the hospital, the commissioner said, concluding that ``serious
quality problems'' existed.
</P>
<P>
   Arbit was chief of neurosurgery at Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center at the time he mistakenly operated on the healthy
right side of the brain of Rajeswari Ayyappan, the 59-year-old
mother of a famous Indian film star, Sridevi Ayyappan, instead of
the left side, where a cancerous tumor was situated.
</P>
<P>
   After the error was discovered, the patient, who had gone to the
hospital with a very poor prognosis, had the tumor removed at New
York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. She later died in India, and
Arbit was fired from Sloan-Kettering. The state gave him one year's
probation in that case. But he quickly found work at Staten Island
University Hospital, which has been trying hard to raise its
reputation from a community hospital to a world-class cancer
center.
</P>
<P>
   Hiring Arbit was part of that grand plan, said several doctors
at the hospital. Before the case at Sloan-Kettering, Arbit had a
polished reputation in his field as the author of textbooks and an
authority on neurosurgery.
</P>
<P>
   He is known for taking on last-resort patients in a field that
has few happy stories, and for caring for the poorest of the poor
as well as the wealthy types of patients who are the only ones who
can afford care at places like Sloan-Kettering. More than a dozen
patients have expressed support for Arbit in telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a hospital was fined so much money was in 1986,
when Harlem Hospital faced $125,000 for allowing an unlicensed
physician to perform a routine operation in which complications
developed that led to the amputation of the patient's leg. But the
state Department of Health suspended $86,000 of the penalty.
</P>
<P>
   A fine reduction in the Staten Island case, ``is not an
option,'' said a Department of Health spokesman.

DIFFICULTY SEEN IN BRINGING CIVIL RIGHTS CASE ON DIALLO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JANE FRITSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors may have difficulty bringing
civil rights charges against the four city police officers who were
acquitted in the death of Amadou Diallo, legal experts say, but
they will be working under Justice Department guidelines written
broadly enough to allow them to file a case if they want to.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines have three requirements: that the case involve
``a substantial federal interest,'' that the original trial left
that interest ``unvindicated'' and that there is strong enough
evidence to win a conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments against a federal case are strong, the experts
said, but not impossible under those terms. And lawyers for
Diallo's parents said they would go to Washington for a meeting on
Thursday armed with a briefcase full of arguments intended to
persuade Justice Department officials to pursue the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are compelling reasons to do so,'' said Anthony
H. Gair, who represents Diallo's mother, Kadiatou. A civil rights
prosecution could delve into issues of racial profiling, using the
officers' own testimony against them, he said. And the prosecution
of the case by the Bronx district attorney's office was flawed,
ineffective and incompetent, he said, also a reason for the federal
government to step in, as it did in the case of the Los Angeles
police officers who were acquitted in a state court of beating
Rodney King.
</P>
<P>
   The visit is also intended to bring political pressure to bear.
The Rev. Al Sharpton, who has been leading demonstrations against
the Police Department, and Rep. Charles B. Rangel of Harlem, the
dean of New York's congressional delegation, are to attend the
session with Deputy Attorney General Eric H. Holder, the
second-ranking official in the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   If federal charges are filed, it would be under a
Reconstruction-era law that makes it a crime for anyone acting
under ``color of law'' _ like a police officer or state official _
to willfully deprive a person of a right protected by the
Constitution. The law was aimed at white officials in Southern
states who might refuse to prosecute people for crimes against
former slaves or might arrest former slaves on frivolous pretexts.
</P>
<P>
   But one word in the law _ willfully _ could be the biggest
hurdle prosecutors would face in bringing charges in the Diallo
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intent is crucial,'' said Sheldon Nahmod, a professor at the
Chicago-Kent School of Law who has written extensively on civil
rights law. ``It's not enough for the criminal prosecutors to show
that they may have violated Diallo's rights,'' Nahmod said.
``What's also required is that they have done so willfully.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not enough, he said, to show that the officers acted
recklessly or should have known that Diallo was doing nothing
wrong. ``What has to be proved is that the police officers knew
that there was not probable cause to arrest,'' Nahmod said.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo, an immigrant from Guinea in West Africa, was standing,
unarmed, in the lobby of his apartment building a year ago when the
four officers fired 41 shots at him, hitting him 19 times. At their
trial, they testified that they thought he had pulled a gun out of
his pocket. It turned out to be a wallet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're really going to have to get inside these officers'
heads,'' said Laurie L. Levinson, a professor at the Loyola Law
School in Los Angeles. ``These guys could be the worst cops in the
world, but if this was just a terrible mistake instead of willful
misconduct, then it's not a federal crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors would have to show that the officers intentionally
committed acts that another officer in the same circumstances would
have thought unreasonable, she said, adding, ``This is a very tough
standard.''
</P>
<P>
   In the King case, she said, federal prosecutors were able to
demonstrate willfulness with both the videotape of the beating and
evidence uncovered after the state trial that showed the officers
had laughed and joked about the beating.
</P>
<P>
   Because rioting broke out after the verdict in the first King
trial, there was a ``very strong showing'' of a federal interest,
Levinson said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal interest in the Diallo case is less obvious, but
could simply be the protection of Diallo's 14th Amendment right
against the taking of his life without due process, the lawyers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrating that the federal interest was not ``vindicated''
at the trial last month is another difficult hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   Gair, Diallo's lawyer, said there were several serious
prosecution mistakes that could meet that Justice Department
requirement. One, he said, is the failure to argue strongly enough
against the change of venue from the Bronx to Albany. Another is
the failure to cross-examine an expert witness called by the
defense to testify about proper police procedure, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But William Van Alstyne, a professor at the Duke University Law
School, said there must be a showing that the prosecutors were
grossly incompetent _ that they came to court drunk or did not show
up at all. ``Even if they were less than brilliantly competent,''
he said, that is insufficient reason to find that the federal
interest was not served.

GATES FOUNDATION GIVES $350 MILLION TO EDUCATION PROGRAMS OVER NEXT
3 YEARS   
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Idaho, Calif., Wash.)  By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will spend $350
million over the next three years on education programs, foundation
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative would start mostly with grants in Washington, the
couple's home state, the officials said, but would eventually
spread across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the money is expected to go to public schools to
help teachers enroll in training programs on integrating high
technology with the classroom and to assist individual schools and
school districts experimenting with new approaches to learning. The
grants were to be formally announced to Washington state educators
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The money represents a significant infusion of cash for the
state, where roughly $6 billion a year is spent on public
education. The grants would initially be made to about 140 schools
and at least 10 school districts across Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's assets have soared in recent years to about $21
billion due to gifts from the Microsoft Corp. chief executive and
his wife, and it is now the wealthiest philanthropic foundation in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The grants follow large pledges by the foundation to
international vaccine programs, scholarships for minority students
and programs to bring computers and Internet access to schools and
libraries in poor communities around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   While details were still being worked out, the money would be
divided into four areas, foundation officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Grants totaling $100 million would be available ``to ensure that
administrators across the nation have access to quality leadership
development, focusing on improving student learning through
technology,'' the foundation said.
</P>
<P>
   Another $70 million would be available for teacher training,
with about $45 million going to about 1,000 teachers in Washington
state in each of the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Grants totaling $30 million would be available for schools.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining $150 million would be spent on about 30 school
districts, beginning with 10 in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   The Gates gift is one in a series of high-profile donations to
public education by private philanthropies and individuals, many
with an emphasis on training programs. Other examples are the more
than $700 million committed to public schools in recent years by
the Annenberg Foundation, and a $100 million gift for training
superintendents, principals and teachers in urban school systems
made last year by Eli Broad, chairman of Sun America, a financial
services company based in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Albertson Foundation, a charitable trust in Boise,
Idaho, whose assets come from a supermarket fortune, announced a
three-year pledge of $110 million in grants to public schools in
Idaho. While dwarfed in size by other national grants, it was
described as the largest per-school commitment ever _ about
$176,000 for every one of the state's public schools.

BUSH WINS BIG VICTORY IN VIRGINIA

<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. _ Gov. George W. Bush won a forceful victory over
Sen. John McCain in the Virginia primary on Tuesday, picking up a
large cache of delegates as well as a considerable morale boost
after his discouraging loss in Michigan a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates drew heavily from the same voter groups that
have supported them in earlier contests for the Republican
presidential nomination. Bush captured faithful Republican voters,
as he did in his victory in South Carolina 10 days ago,
particularly conservatives and those who call themselves members of
the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won the overwhelming support of independents and
Democrats. While those voters were responsible for the Arizona
senator's first-place finishes in Michigan and New Hampshire before
that, they accounted for a much smaller proportion of the
electorate here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the results show that the wave of publicity after
his upset victory in Michigan, and his fresh appeal that he was ``a
proud Reagan conservative,'' were not sufficient to carry him over
the finish line. And McCain's blunt attacks Monday on leaders of
the religious right failed to rouse independents and Democrats,
although the senator's advisers argue that message will play better
in upcoming states with higher proportions of moderates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush on Tuesday night characterized his victory as a
condemnation of McCain's recent efforts to paint Bush as a captive
of the religious right. ``The voters of Virginia rejected the
politics of pitting one religion against another,'' Bush declared
at a rally on Tuesday evening in Cincinnati. ``This campaign is
winning and we're doing it the right way. We are uniting our party
without compromising principle.''
</P>
<P>
   With 80 percent of the precincts reporting in Virginia, Bush had
55 percent of the vote, McCain had 42 percent and Alan Keyes had 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In delivering his celebratory speech in Ohio rather than here in
Virginia, Bush underscored how the looming jumble of contests next
Tuesday overshadowed the voting on Tuesday. The election on March 7
is tantamount to a national primary, with Republicans going to the
polls in California, New York, Ohio, Georgia, Missouri and seven
other states. As a result, the contenders have raced from one coast
to the other - and in between.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not stumped in Virginia since Friday night, when he
spoke here at party dinner. McCain rushed out of the state early
Monday afternoon after condemning Pat Robertson and the Rev. Jerry
Falwell, two leaders of the religious right, in a speech in
Virginia Beach. On Tuesday, as he bounced in California from
Stockton to Fresno to Bakersfield, Mr. McCain seemed as clearly
focused on next Tuesday. ``California is a critical state,'' he
said. ``And I need to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Virginia was the largest delegate prize of the day,
Washington state also held a primary on Tuesday. Both candidates
spent as much time in recent days competing there as in Virginia.
The McCain campaign viewed that state _ with a history of rewarding
insurgents _ as more hospitable to their candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Voters also went to caucuses on Tuesday in North Dakota, which
has only 19 delegates. There was also a Democratic primary in
Washington state, where no delegates were at stake. Bill Bradley
campaigned vigorously there, struggling for a symbolic victory as a
first step in catching Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In this roller-coaster of a primary season, the outcome in
Virginia was a substantial victory for Bush because by capturing
all of Virginia's 56 delegates to the national convention (1,034
are needed for the nomination), he surpassed McCain in the total
delegate tally. Bush was well organized in this state, relying on
the energetic support of the state's most prominent elected
Republicans, particularly Gov. James S. Gilmore III and Sen. John
W. Warner, and vastly outspending McCain. McCain had boasted that
he would beat the ``Gilmore-Warner machine'' just as he had topped
Gov. John M. Engler's organization in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain just played it wrong in attacking the Gilmore-Warner
machine in Virginia,'' said Mark J. Rozell, a professor of politics
at Catholic University and an expert on Virginia politics. ``He
named probably the two most popular figures in Virginia politics.
And by making several campaign stops in Virginia, McCain raised the
expectations for his candidacy and failed badly. It gives momentum
to George W. Bush going in to Super Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as they played down the significance of the outcome on
Tuesday, McCain's aides had significantly stepped up his budget for
the state in recent days after the senator's victory in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The McCain folks were working very hard; they bought our whole
voter file,'' said Ed Matricardi, executive director of the
Republican Party of Virginia. ``They ran a full-fledged campaign
here. The Bush people did too.'' Told that the McCain operation
said it was never particularly serious about Virginia, Matricardi
said, ``How can you advertise heavily in the most expensive
television market _ northern Virginia _ and say you didn't campaign
here?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While McCain's supporters dismissed Bush as simply winning
another southern state, this state is more diverse than South
Carolina, from the tobacco country in the south to the coal country
in the west to the Washington suburbs to the north.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you know that the western tip of Virginia is further west
than Detroit?'' Matricardi said on Tuesday as he pointed to a
brightly-colored map on the wall of his office. But although this
state is more diverse than South Carolina, it is significantly more
conservative than Michigan _ and that helps explain why Bush won.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that McCain still has difficulty winning significant
support from loyal Republicans may also be a promising sign for
Bush as the contests turn largely to states where only Republicans
can vote. More than six in 10 of the voters on Tuesday described
themselves as Republicans and they overwhelmingly backed Bush,
according to a survey of voters leaving the polls.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly three in 10 voters said they considered themselves
independents _and they just as overwhelmingly backed McCain. Less
than one in 10 voters described themselves as Democrats, and they
overwhelmingly backed McCain. Bush was far more successful here
than in Michigan because voters in Virginia are more conservative.
Nearly six in 10 of voters here described themselves as
conservatives, compared to just over four in 10 in Michigan. The
conservative voters in Virginia backed Bush over McCain by a margin
of more than two to one.
</P>
<P>
   But moderates, who accounted for about three in 10 of the voters
on Tuesday, backed McCain over Bush by nearly the same margin.
Liberals, who made up one in 10 of the electorate, overwhelmingly
backed McCain.

<P>
   BAKERSFIELD, Calif. _ The tense battle over the influence of the
religious right intensified Tuesday as Sen. John McCain accused Pat
Robertson and Jerry Falwell of having an ``evil influence'' over
the Republican Party, while Gov. George W. Bush assailed the
senator for ``pitting one religion against another.''
</P>
<P>
   Their comments came as the see-saw battle for the Republican
nomination tilted once again to the Bush side with the Texas
governor winning a lopsided victory over McCain in the Virginia
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Cincinnati, Bush said the Virginia results bring the
Republicans ``one step closer to victory'' and ``one step closer to
a united party.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's statements Tuesday, following his incendiary attack
on the leaders of the Christian right the day before, seemed to
continue if not escalate his effort to marginalize what has been an
important segment of the Republican party for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Monday, McCain called Robertson and Falwell
``agents of intolerance.'' He went further Tuesday, criticizing
them for ``the evil influence that they exercise over the
Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To stand up and take on the forces of evil _ that's my job,
and I can't steer the Republican Party if those two individuals
have the influence that they have on the party today,'' he said
Tuesday, speaking to reporters on his campaign bus as it traveled
down the Central Valley of California.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're supposed to tolerate evil in your party in the name of
party unity?'' he continued. ``That's not what the party is all
about. That's not what Abraham Lincoln said our party was about.
Theodore Roosevelt fought the forces of evil in the Republican
Party to his demise. Ronald Reagan rejected extremism in our
party.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though McCain's assault on the Christian Right did him
little if any good with voters in Virginia, he is casting himself
as the one candidate who can rescue the Republican Party from
religious leaders who, he argues, preach ``a message of intolerance
and exclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   He has portrayed Bush as deeply indebted to the leadership of
the Christian right, which sprang to his aid during the bitter
weeks of campaigning in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   To further that effort, McCain's campaign announced Tuesday that
it had been calling voters in Washington state, which also held its
Republican primary Tuesday. The calls, McCain aides said, alerted
voters that Bush campaigned at Bob Jones University in South
Carolina without condemning that school's anti-Catholic teachings.
The senator's campaign made the similar calls in Michigan for its
primary, which McCain won last week.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also complained Tuesday about ``vicious attacks'' by
leaders of the religious right on Gen. Colin Powell, the former
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and on former Sen. Warren
Rudman, R-N.H., the co-chairman of McCain's national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping that one of the motivations for embracing our
vision is that every one of Falwell's and Robertson's candidates
lost in the 1998 elections _ every single one of them,'' McCain
told reporters. ``Now, if your job is to go on continued kamikaze
missions, then fine. But if you want to change that and start
regaining the majority that we had in the '80s, then you've got to
change the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Falwell and Robertson said both declined to comment on
McCain's attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In Stockton, a reporter asked McCain whether he was worried that
his speech in Virginia Beach on Monday would fracture a winning
coalition for the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me,'' McCain cut in. ``A winning coalition? Which
winning coalition are we talking about in a state that has lost the
last two presidential elections, that has lost the last two
congressional elections. Here in California, it's been an electoral
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also announced Tuesday that he would participate after
all in a debate here on Thursday night. The debate, sponsored by
The Los Angeles Times, will be broadcast live on CNN. On Sunday,
McCain's aides said he had pulled out of the debate in order to
campaign in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The reversal resulted in a wave of unfavorable news coverage,
and the Bush campaign gleefully portrayed it as a strategic retreat
by McCain, who still trails badly among California Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain's aides tried to counter that impression by
pointing out all the time and television money they are spending
here, they came to recognize that it looked terrible for their
candidate not to appear at the only debate scheduled before this
state's primary next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want the debates, symbolically, to be
misinterpreted,'' said McCain's senior strategist, Mike Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   McCain plans now to participate by satellite hook-up, and Bush's
staff said he might do the same.
</P>
<P>
   But in addressing one controversy, McCain created yet another,
this one over his level of candor with reporters when confronted
with sticky questions about the conduct of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, McCain and his aides first denied responsibility for
a series of phone calls to Catholic voters in Michigan telling them
about Bush's appearance at Bob Jones University. Later, they
acknowledged that the campaign had paid a telemarketing firm $8,000
to make 24,000 phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, when first asked whether he had ruled out
appearing at the debate, either in person or by satellite feed,
McCain replied in seemingly unambiguous terms. ``There's no
possible way,'' he said, adding that ``we cannot flex our
schedule'' to debate Bush.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, minutes after finishing a town hall meeting,
McCain called a press conference to say that he would debate after
all.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over, reporters asked why he had changed his mind, and
over and over McCain repeated the same response: ``Because we were
able to change our schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, under persistent questioning, McCain, who calls his bus
the Straight Talk Express and who concludes almost every stump
speech by promising ``to always tell you the truth, no matter
what,'' acknowledged that he had not been candid with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real deal is that as frank and honest and straight talk as
our express is, sometimes I don't share all of the inner workings
and contemplations of our campaign,'' he said, revealing that he
had earlier instructed his aides to explore the possibility of
participating in the debate by satellite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we were ready to make that change, I apologize for not
sharing my musings with you as to how we achieve being in the
debate,'' he said, then adding with a cackle, ``But from now on,
straight talk.''

FLORIDA UTILITY SETTLES AIR POLLUTION LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government's campaign to make seven utilities
bring old coal-fired electric plants up to modern pollution
standards showed its first results Tuesday when a Florida utility
agreed to spend about $1 billion to switch one plant to natural gas
and make major changes at a second.
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa Electric Co. did not admit guilt but agreed to pay a
penalty of $3.5 million to settle civil charges brought by the
Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Air Act. The
utility also agreed to spend $10 million on pollution control
research and experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agreement supersedes a settlement that the utility
had made with the state of Florida. That agreement was contingent
on Tampa Electric being allowed by the state Public Service
Commission to pass along the cost of the re-engineering of the
plants to its customers.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said Tuesday's settlement in the case that was
brought last November was a legal wedge to gain agreements with the
other six utilities. They hinted that they would bring charges
against more utilities under a provision of the Clean Air Act
requiring that when old plants are modernized they be brought up to
current air pollution standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a precedent that will send a signal to the other
companies that this is what we think is appropriate control,'' said
Sylvia Lowrance, principal deputy assistant administrator of the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Carol M. Browner, the agency administrator, said the change
would reduce emissions that cause or aggravate respiratory
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   The executives said that willingness to convert the plant was
based in part on plans now taking shape for a new gas line in
Florida, and on the fact that existing equipment is near the end of
its life, and that a new gas plant could make electricity as the
same price as the old coal plant.
</P>
<P>
   The plant, Gannon, was built in 1957, and company officials said
that rebuilding it as a gas-fired plant would allow them to use the
steam turbines and some other equipment and raise its output at a
time when the demand for electricity is growing rapidly. The
agreement, they said, would also protect them in case the agency
set more stringent rules on coal plants in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is actually a business decision, in light of what all is
going on in the environmental area,'' said Spence Autry, a vice
president of the utility, who negotiated the deal. ``It puts us in
a very good position for whatever could come down the pike later
on.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebuilt Gannon plant, using high-efficiency natural gas
technology, would produce electricity for about the same price as
the coal plant, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The other utilities charged with Tampa Electric in November were
adamant that the settlement, which had been rumored since the
company reached the state agreement in December, did not have any
bearing on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The settlement with TECO really has no impact on our case,''
said Pat Hemlepp, a spokesman for American Electric Power, which
uses the most coal among the investor-owned utilities. ``We don't
feel pressured by this to have any rush to settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemlepp said that there were no settlement discussions under way
now but that ``we are always willing to talk about reasonable
solutions to this enforcement action.''
</P>
<P>
   Electricity experts pointed out that Tampa Electric is smaller
than the other utilities in the case and, unlike the bigger
defendants, can commit to switching to natural gas without
affecting the national market for that fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The federal settlement requires Tampa Electric to to make
changes at a second coal-fired station, Big Bend. The company has
agreed to improve the performance of scrubbers, which reduce
emissions that cause acid rain, and to install another kind of
system to control smog-forming nitrogen oxide emissions by 2010. If
the utility cannot meet that deadline, the plant must be shut down
or switched to natural gas by 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Changing to natural gas reduces emissions sharply. Browner said
that switching Gannon to natural gas would reduce emissions of
sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, by 60 tons a year, and fine
particles, which are lung irritants, by 2,000 tons per year.
Nitrogen oxide would fall by 30 tons per year. ``These are very,
very large reductions,'' she said.

YES, IT'S STILL THE ECONOMY, STUPID, BUT WITH AN ASTERISK  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If Vice President Al Gore has counted on anything
in this tumultuous political season, it is that the strong economy
will give him the upper hand in the general election should he win
the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The economy remains as strong as ever. But Gore's strategy for
using it to his advantage would have to change _ and could in the
end prove to be less potent _ if his Republican opponent turned out
to be Sen. John McCain rather than Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   To Gore's team, Bush, who until a few weeks ago seemed to have a
lock on his party's nomination, is in many ways the ideal rival.
The centerpiece of the Texan's campaign has been his big tax cut, a
proposal that Gore's advisers are certain they could label fiscally
irresponsible, a threat to Social Security and a gamble with the
current prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to economic issues, McCain presents a smaller,
more elusive target. While he supports tax cuts, they are of a
scale closer to those advocated by Gore. Like President Clinton and
the vice president, McCain emphasizes that saving Social Security
is his first goal. Like the administration, he promotes the
long-term benefits of reducing the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain is not challenging the basic framework of the
Clinton-Gore administration,'' said Will Marshall, president of the
Progressive Policy Institute, a research organization created by
centrist Democrats. ``That will make it tougher for Gore to find
points of contrast if McCain turns out to be the Republican
nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   To McCain's supporters, his middle-of-the-road approach on
economic policy is a crucial element of a driving force behind his
candidacy: his argument that he is more electable than Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``What McCain talks about in policy is politically doable within
Washington, and it insulates him and puts him in a position of
strategic advantage relative to Gore should he face him in the
fall,'' said Rep. Mark Sanford, a Republican from South Carolina
who backs McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Democrats have beaten Republicans over the head with _
with great success _ was the notion that we wanted big tax cuts to
the exclusion of Social Security and Medicare,'' Sanford said.
``McCain's plan allows us to say we agree that Social Security
ought to be first, and here's how we propose to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps just as important, or more so, neutralizing the economic
issue could give McCain a chance to move the campaign to the ground
on which he feels strongest: character and reform. Indeed, relative
to either Gore or Bush, he has little interest in the details of
economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be a battle over who's a better wonk,'' said Marshall
Wittman, director of government relations at the conservative
Heritage Foundation, who supports McCain. ``The battle would be
over who do you trust, and that's where McCain has the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign, of course, does not see it that way. Advisers
to the vice president said they would make a case that McCain is
just as conservative as Bush. They also said they viewed McCain as
open to attack on some critical issues, especially Social Security.
McCain advocates using a big chunk of the projected federal budget
surplus to create private investment accounts within the retirement
system. Most Democrats have long said such a step would leave the
elderly vulnerable to the volatility of Wall Street and divert
money from debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the issue is, as it should be, who can keep the economic
prosperity going,'' said Chris Lehane, Gore's spokesman, ``then the
fact that Al Gore has been a major player in an administration that
has created the longest economic expansion on record is going to be
the main factor.''
</P>
<P>
   It is still unclear whether McCain's moderate stance on fiscal
policy will win the day in the Republican primaries. Bush has not
wavered in his advocacy of sweeping tax cuts as the best way to
stimulate growth and, as he puts it, to keep politicians in
Washington from squandering the surplus on wasteful government
spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `Well, your tax cut plan isn't taking hold, the
exit polls don't show anything, you must abandon it,''' Bush said
after his defeat in Michigan last week. ``I'm not going to abandon
the tax cut plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is using McCain's moderate position on taxes to lump him
with Gore and Democrats generally, and is trying to block McCain's
efforts to claim the mantle of Ronald Reagan as the true
conservative in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for Senator McCain and Vice President Gore to
hear this important fact: that taxes on working people in America
are at the highest level they've been since World War II,'' Bush
told a rally in Virginia last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In response, McCain has emphasized his conservative credentials,
especially his advocacy of slashing pork-barrel spending and ending
corporate tax subsidies and loopholes. His argument is that it is
more conservative to keep spending in check, reduce the national
debt and shore up Social Security than to enact a tax cut that
would go mostly to the wealthy _ a sharp jab at Republican
orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that the Democrats will try to make John
McCain carry all the baggage of his party,'' said Marshall, of the
Progressive Policy Institute. ``The question is whether this
campaign will be for McCain what Bill Clinton's `different kind of
Democrat' campaign did for him in 1992, which was to show that you
couldn't put him into the old categories.''

TESTIMONY HINTS AT SLOW PROGRESS ON INTERNET ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ariz., Va.)   (bl)  
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The official in charge of the government's
cybercrime-fighting unit told a congressional panel Tuesday that
the FBI was uncertain whether one or more groups was responsible
for the recent attacks on e-commerce sites.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a Justice Department official warned that
``online crime is rapidly increasing.''
</P>
<P>
   In testimony suggesting that progress on the investigation has
been slow, Michael A. Vatis, director of the National
Infrastructure Protection Center, said agents were ``working
aggressively'' and ``continue to make good progress.'' But he also
acknowledged that much work remained in finding those responsible
for attacks in February on Yahoo, eBay, CNN and Amazon.com, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to tell whether this is the result of copycats
or the same people involved in the first attacks,'' Vatis told
members of a joint hearing by subcommittees of the Senate and House
judiciary committees to study the government's response to the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Vatis officially acknowledged for the first time that
investigators had sought and received cooperation from foreign
governments. Debra Joy Weierman, an FBI spokeswoman, said that did
not necessarily suggest the government believed that some attacks
had originated overseas but only that some leads suggested the need
to gather information internationally.
</P>
<P>
   Vatis' comments seemed to undercut the weight of testimony Feb.
16 by the FBI director, Louis Freeh, that the case was producing
``fast-developing leads,'' suggesting that a break in the case
might be imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Vatis said agents still had ``hundreds of leads we're following
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts, executives and computer security experts have
said it might be difficult, if not impossible, to determine who was
responsible and perhaps an even greater challenge to prove guilt in
court. Computer crimes are a forensics challenge because they are
typically designed to mask their origins.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators pressed both the law-enforcement officials and
Internet industry executives Tuesday on whether the attacks argued
for increased penalties for cybercrime and whether more financing
was needed for tracking and prosecuting cybercriminals.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. told the panel that
federal law enforcement urgently needed the $37 million that
President Clinton had requested in new financing in 2001 to expand
staffing, training and tools for fighting cybercrime.
</P>
<P>
   Holder said the susceptibility of the nation's private and
public computer infrastructure was ``astonishingly high.'' And he
added, ``Online crime is rapidly increasing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle echoed Holder's sense of
urgent concern, though not all seemed to agree the money should be
automatically appropriated.
</P>
<P>
   But almost without exception, they said the role of the
government should be limited in creating measures to prevent the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, they said the private sector should take the lead in
protecting its sites, much as homeowners are expected to put
adequate locks on their doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't fool ourselves that Congress alone can solve the
problem,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   He and Sen. John Kyl, R-Ariz., have proposed legislation that
would lower the barriers federal agents would need to trace an
electronic signal to a single warrant, even if the signal traveled
through several states and companies.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, investigators must get a separate warrant for each
network service provider whose system the signal crosses, which can
be hundreds in a single instance.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Robert Scott, D-Va., asked the law enforcement
officials who would have jurisdiction to issue such warrants and
whether all states and companies would support federal
jurisdiction.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 5) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Michael Rush is the author of ``New Media in Late 20th-Century
Art,'' recently published by Thames and Hudson.  
 By MICHAEL RUSH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Merce Cunningham once told Charles Atlas: ``When
approaching a new work, ask yourself, `What are the possibilities
of this situation?' Go as far as possible. Work with all the
possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlas (known by his friends as Charlie) was with Cunningham as
protege and collaborator for more than 13 years, during which they
invented what Atlas calls ``mediadance.''
</P>
<P>
   Not pure dance or pure video or film, mediadance is perhaps best
understood by what it isn't: it is not documentation of a dance nor
a film about dance. It is dance conceived for the filmed image,
dependent as much on camera work and editing as it is on
choreography.
</P>
<P>
   The best example of it remains one of Atlas' first works with
Cunningham, ``Blue Studio: Five Segments'' (1975-76), in which
Cunningham appears to float through a galaxy of colors and
sculptured forms unfettered by gravity.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 30 years, Atlas has created scores of videos, films,
performances and set and lighting designs for opera, theater and
dance. From Friday through April 1 he returns to the Kitchen in
Chelsea, where he first performed a short dance in a 1974 series
that also featured the artists Joan Jonas and Hannah Wilke.
</P>
<P>
   His current appearance is as a video-installation artist with
two new works, ``As If You Like It'' and ``10,'' both of which will
fill the walls of the Kitchen's large second-floor gallery with
digitally altered patterns of mesmerizing movement by elaborately
costumed performers. Atlas thinks of himself as a portraitist,
probing the edges of identity through abstract scenarios staged for
the camera.
</P>
<P>
   But wait a minute. What about that name, Charles Atlas? Did this
tall, lean, 50-year-old St. Louis native with the close-cropped
bleached blond hair assume the famed body builder's name as a prank
or a fantasy when he came to New York after two years at Swarthmore
College in the late '60s?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the real Charles Atlas,'' he protests during a recent
interview in his Chelsea apartment. ``The other one was born Angelo
Siciliano, and he changed his name to Charles Atlas.'' Charlie's
father was born an Atlas in Lithuania and immigrated when he was 3
to the United States, where he later worked as a traveling
salesman. Charles is the Anglicized version of Srael, the name of
an uncle who had died in the old country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dance was never what I wanted to do,'' Atlas says, sitting
next to stacks of magazines with names like Dazed and the Face. ``I
always thought of myself as a media artist who sort of fell into
dance.'' Catapulted is more like it. In 1970 he took a job as an
assistant stage manager with Cunningham's company.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he left, in 1983, he had been production manager,
lighting designer, sometime costume designer and, most important,
filmmaker-in-residence. During these years he directed more than 20
videos and films, not only with Cunningham, but also with many
others from the pantheon of downtown dance, including Douglas Dunn,
James Waring and Yvonne Rainer.
</P>
<P>
   After growing tired of touring and wanting more time for his own
projects, he left the company (and its regular paycheck). ``Three
people took my place,'' he says, not boasting, but just supplying
the facts.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights of his works since then are collaborations
in film and video with artists like Bill Irwin, Marina Abramovic,
Karole Armitage and Leigh Bowery (best known as a model for the
British painter Lucian Freud) and a collection of tapes made for
the Martha(at)Mother performances, organized by the Martha Graham
impersonator Richard Move at the nightclub Mother in the
meatpacking district.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Atlas conceived ``As Seen on TV'' with Irwin for Public
Television's ``Alive From Off Center,'' the adventurous avant-garde
series that lasted only a few seasons. A riotous sendup of the
chaos and humiliation associated with an open casting call for an
unnamed theatrical event, it stars Irwin as a Chaplinesque
performer who, while waiting his turn to audition, wanders into a
room that has a video camera and television set.
</P>
<P>
   Through a series of cleverly rendered mishaps with the camera,
Irwin ends up inserting himself in network television shows in
progress: news reports, sports events, soap operas, ballets and
``Sesame Street.'' The program, which became the basis for Irwin's
Broadway show ``Largely New York,'' was for Atlas ``the one time I
had enough money to do all the things I wanted to do as a director
and editor.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlas' association with the Belgrade-born artist Marina
Abramovic has yielded a number of daring videos and performances,
including ``Delusional'' (1994), during which Abramovic, wearing
only a sheer plastic costume and black stiletto heels inside a
glass-enclosed set, lets loose 400 rats that were hidden under a
rug.
</P>
<P>
   A meditation on death and decay in war-torn Bosnia, this theater
piece followed the two artists' 1989 video, ``SSS,'' in which
Abramovic wore a Medusa-style headdress made of real snakes.
</P>
<P>
   Atlas explored the humorous limits of human endurance with
Bowery in several tapes made before the performer's death in 1994.
In one, Bowery, decked out in garish drag, a la John Waters' star
Divine, pierced his cheeks with large safety pins to which he
attached fake red lips and then struggled to mouth the words to
Aretha Franklin's ``Take a Look.''
</P>
<P>
   As touching as it is discomforting, the tape celebrates artifice
as Atlas leaves unedited his own guffaws and off-hand comments from
behind the camera while Bowery, a study in vulnerability, performs
close to the lens.
</P>
<P>
   Among Atlas' many influences are Warhol's films, especially
``The Chelsea Girls'' (1966), Hollywood romances from the '30s and
'40s and, currently, television. His self-described devotion to
channel surfing is evident in the racing images of his ``Martha''
tapes, many of which are compilations of clips from forgotten films
like ``Rhythm on the Range'' (1936) and ``Around the World''
(1943).
</P>
<P>
   From ``Little Strange,'' a brief sketch with actors and a cat
performed in a downtown loft in 1972, to an elaborate 15-channel
video installation, ``The Hanged One,'' that filled a castle
outside Amsterdam in 1997, Atlas continues to seek and find new
possibilities. But what he would really love to do, he says, is
``bring back Leigh Bowery and film him in 3-D IMAX!''

US CHARGES HUSSEIN SQUANDERING MILLIONS ON PALACES 
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
Tuesday that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was building more
palaces with gold-plated faucets.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Iraqi president was reaping millions of dollars by
illegally shipping refined oil in defiance of UN sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin suggested the Iraqi elite was a bunch of drunks.
</P>
<P>
   The broadside against Iraq, only the latest in a series of US
presentations against Baghdad, was issued as the Clinton
administration feels an increasing pressure from UN Security
Council members and some members of Congress to lift the nine years
of economic sanctions imposed since the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin's statements veered in new directions, not always put
diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
   After presenting ``newly declassified satellite imagery''
showing the Iraqi leader's palace additions, available on
www.usia.gov, after clicking on ``Near East,'' Rubin said oil
smuggling has grown in recent months from a rebuilt refinery
destroyed during four days of bombing in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   One legal import, he said, was alcohol, which goes through the
port of Aqaba, Jordan, bound for Iraq under the food-for-oil
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The regime in Baghdad is consuming more than 10,000 bottles of
whiskey, 350,000 cans of beer and 7,000 bottles of wine per week,
and alcohol is illegal in Iraq,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol, actually, is legally sold out of Christian-run
storefronts in Baghdad, though banned in restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important point here is that the regime is getting drunk
while it claims its people don't have enough to eat,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said Hussein spends billions of dollars building palaces
and buying the loyalty of security guards ``so that he can prevent
them from putting a bullet in his head.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, three top UN officials have resigned from
their jobs in Iraq in protest of the UN sanctions, which they said
unfairly harmed the people of Iraq and not the government. The most
recent one to quit was Hans von Sponeck.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin Tuesday called von Sponeck ``well-intentioned but
misguided,'' adding, ``He seems to think, in what I and what this
administration considers a matter of wishful thinking, that if
sanctions were (lifted), somehow the people of Iraq would be
getting the benefits of sanctions relief when all the indicators
are the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mahdi al-Bassam, a founding member of the Iraqi National
Congress, a coalition of opposition groups aiming to oust Hussein,
said Rubin's comments Tuesday seemed far-fetched or were only
recycled charges against the Iraqi regime. The Congress opposes the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to find excuses to go on with the failed
policy of sanctions,'' said al-Bassam, a Houston doctor. ``There is
guilt in the US and I guess with the Western powers, about what is
going on in Iraq in terms of starvation.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Bassam also said the administration doesn't want to implement
the Iraq Liberation Act, a $97 million plan to supply cast-off
Pentagon equipment to opposition groups. So far, the United States
has spent $20,000 toward the effort, nearly a year and a half after
passage by Congress, said Francis J. Brooke, executive director of
the Iraq Liberation Action Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Iraq's UN mission received a transcript of Rubin's
comments. An Iraqi official laughed at the remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know the Americans were keeping track of people who
were drinking in Iraq,'' the official said.

STATE FINES HOSPITAL, CITING BOTCHED BRAIN SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs to clarify operations mentioned in the lead)  
(jw) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The state Department of Health cited Staten Island
University Hospital on Tuesday for 40 violations and fined the
hospital $80,000 for failing to monitor and discipline its chief of
neurosurgery, who twice in five years operated on the wrong sides
of patients' brains.
</P>
<P>
   The state's action was the harshest penalty and stiffest fine it
had imposed on a hospital in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the neurosurgeon, Dr. Ehud Arbit, bungled a cranial
procedure on a severely ill Staten Island patient who then died,
Health Commissioner Antonia C. Novello announced at a news
conference Tuesday. Arbit was fired from Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Hospital in 1995 for operating on the wrong side of a patient's
brain after confusing two patients.
</P>
<P>
   While the state investigation did not conclude that Arbit's
surgery caused the death of the Staten Island patient, it said that
one other patient of his had died after a questionable procedure,
and that others had become disabled. In several instances, the
state said, the hospital did not report any of the medical errors,
as it is required to do, and violated several provisions of New
York's health laws.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the fine, which the state said could not be
appealed, Novello ordered the Staten Island hospital to hire an
outside consultant to monitor the quality of care there.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital issued a statement Tuesday, in which it said it had
cooperated with state investigators and would work to improve its
monitoring system, in neurosurgery and throughout the hospital. It
said it was preparing a line-by-line response to the state's
findings.
</P>
<P>
   Arbit's lawyer, Anthony Scher, said Tuesday night, ``There was
an investigation into this issue and it is absolutely clear that he
did not operate on the wrong side of the brain. I have not seen the
state report, but it seems to me that they also understand that
that is not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of Arbit's colleagues said in interviews that he had
been unfairly maligned by other hospital workers as a result of
political battles within the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The state began its investigation after receiving several
complaints, and issued its findings Tuesday in a strongly worded
23-page report outlining many allegations, all stemming from
surgical procedures performed by Arbit.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found that Arbit and the hospital failed to
prepare for surgery properly. The state also cited the hospital for
its decision to allow physicians' assistants to take critical roles
during surgery, performing duties that the state said should have
been done by doctors. In one case, the state charged, Arbit sought
the medical advice of an equipment salesman for spinal plates
during an operation that was going badly. (The salesman, who was
observing the surgery, declined to answer.)
</P>
<P>
   Novello's investigators also outlined, in charge by charge,
gruesome details of what it said were botched operations. In the
case involving surgery on the wrong side of the brain, state
investigators found that a 54-year-old patient, with multiple
illnesses including brain and lung tumors, liver disease, diabetes
and pancreatitis, went into the operating room. The state report
said the patient's CAT scans were not brought into the operating
room, and that Arbit made an incision on the left cerebellum, only
to be told by a physician's assistant that she recalled the tumor
was on the right side.
</P>
<P>
   Arbit told state health investigators that he had intended all
along to remove the entire back of the skull, and that the side of
the placement of the first incision did not matter. He asserted
that he followed acceptable neurosurgical standards, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   The patient, identified by those familiar with the case as
Johnnie Artis, a security supervisor from Staten Island, fell into
a coma and died on Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from that case, the most serious allegation in the state's
report involved treatment of a 21-year-old patient, who suffered
from a brain tumor and was left to bleed excessively, the state
said. The doctor had used a device that others complained produced
a fuzzy, unusable image, the state said. He switched from
performing a biopsy to brain surgery, catching other staff
off-guard and ill prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Because the anesthesiologist had not anticipated more than a
biopsy, the patient's blood was not typed, and he had not prepared
to replace large quantities of blood, the report noted. A second
procedure was necessary to stop the bleeding, the state said. ``The
patient was unresponsive after surgery and died several weeks
later,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Another case involved a patient requiring spinal surgery. An
anesthesiologist and a physician's assistant told Department of
Health investigators that Arbit's hand slipped and lacerated the
patient's spinal cord, leaving her partially paralyzed, according
to the state's report. In another instance, the doctor and his
staff failed to perform proper follow-up blood work on a
62-year-old patient, exposing her to high risk when she underwent
additional surgery, the state found.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the case involving the equipment salesman, a patient
complained of weakness in her hands after an operation. A CAT scan
revealed loose screws on a plate that had been implanted in the
patient's spine along the back of the neck, the state noted. Arbit
failed to replace the screws properly, the state said, at one point
asking a medical equipment salesman in the operating room whether
he thought the plate was positioned correctly, the investigators
found.
</P>
<P>
   These medical errors so disturbed the hospital's chief
neurosurgery anesthesiologist that he refused to work with Arbit
and complained to hospital officials, who declined to take action,
the state said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the state rebuked the hospital for failing to report
these cases and for failing to deal with them properly in internal
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our investigation found an alarmingly high number of
deficiencies in the hospital's controls and procedures that need to
be in place to ensure patients receive proper care,'' Novello said.
``Worse yet,'' she added, the hospital failed to notify the state
of any worrisome cases, nor did it move to discipline the doctor or
properly investigate the cases when alerted of them.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, Staten Island University Hospital officials
said they would begin instituting new monitoring procedures to
ensure patient safety and quality of care within the next few days.
But the hospital cautioned that the state's Office of Professional
Medical Conduct, which licenses physicians in the state and
disciplines doctors, had yet to complete interviews with all
personnel involved or to finish its investigation of Arbit.
</P>
<P>
   Novello's announcement Tuesday of stiff fines and a slew of
health violations underscored her decision to make the disciplining
of doctors and quality of care monitoring at hospitals a hallmark
of her tenure, which began in June. For instance, the state of New
York had only twice suspended a doctor's license before an
investigation was completed, both times on Novello's watch and both
in the last few months.
</P>
<P>
   Arbit surrendered his license on Feb. 18. The other doctor who
surrendered his license while being investigated was Dr. Allan
Zarkin, who admitted to carving his initials into the stomach of a
patient on whom he had performed a Caesarean section last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Novello's tough stance comes at a time when President Clinton is
pressing states to adopt strict regulations for reporting medical
errors, after a recent report that found medical errors kills
hundreds of thousands of people each year. ``I want to be perfectly
clear,'' Novello said Tuesday. ``When and if the Department of
Health finds that a hospital is not operating up to high standards,
we will move swiftly and decisively.''
</P>
<P>
   The state began its investigation into Staten Island University
Hospital on Feb. 9, when it received complaints that Arbit had
operated on the wrong side of Artis' brain. When state
investigators contacted the hospital, Novello said, its
administrators told them, ``it was a rumor,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The state made an unannounced visit to the hospital the next
day, during which several hospital staff members volunteered
information about the surgeries, Novello said. A week later,
investigators returned and found corroborating evidence, she said.
On Friday, the state concluded its ``intensive investigation'' into
the hospital, the commissioner said, concluding that ``serious
quality problems'' existed.
</P>
<P>
   Arbit was chief of neurosurgery at Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center at the time he mistakenly operated on the healthy
right side of the brain of Rajeswari Ayyappan, the 59-year-old
mother of a famous Indian film star, Sridevi Ayyappan, instead of
the left side, where a cancerous tumor was situated.
</P>
<P>
   After the error was discovered, the patient, who had gone to the
hospital with a very poor prognosis, had the tumor removed at New
York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. She later died in India, and
Arbit was fired from Sloan-Kettering. The state gave him one year's
probation in that case. But he quickly found work at Staten Island
University Hospital, which has been trying hard to raise its
reputation from a community hospital to a world-class cancer
center.
</P>
<P>
   Hiring Arbit was part of that grand plan, said several doctors
at the hospital. Before the case at Sloan-Kettering, Arbit had a
polished reputation in his field as the author of textbooks and an
authority on neurosurgery.
</P>
<P>
   He is known for taking on last-resort patients in a field that
has few happy stories, and for caring for the poorest of the poor
as well as the wealthy types of patients who are the only ones who
can afford care at places like Sloan-Kettering. More than a dozen
patients have expressed support for Arbit in telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a hospital was fined so much money was in 1986,
when Harlem Hospital faced $125,000 for allowing an unlicensed
physician to perform a routine operation in which complications
developed that led to the amputation of the patient's leg. But the
state Department of Health suspended $86,000 of the penalty.
</P>
<P>
   A fine reduction in the Staten Island case, ``is not an
option,'' said a Department of Health spokesman.

GOVERNOR REVIVES MESSAGE OF INCLUSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ To be sure, Governor George W. Bush was beaming,
relieved to hear early news of his solid victory in the Virginia
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally,'' Bush said, breaking into a grin, after an aide
whispered the first poll results in his ear shortly after 2 p.m.
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the victory did not alter the strange reality Bush now
faces: Despite his early message of ``compassionate conservatism,''
the Texas governor has been cast by his opponent as a captive of
the right-wing establishment, narrow-minded and even bigoted on
issues of religion and race.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the Virginia primary appear to alter Bush's new strategy
over the last few days. He still calls himself a ``reformer with
results,'' the slogan developed after his New Hampshire primary
loss. But suddenly, after suffering withering attacks on his
ability to attract a wide spectrum of support, Bush seems to be
returning to the mantra that he used to launch his campaign:
compassionate conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting a half-built Catholic Charities center in Ohio, Bush
talked about the ``mosaic'' of religions that comprise the
charitable community. He recalled a visit to an evangelical
hospital. He talked about the roles of ``Christians, Muslims and
Jewish people'' in the volunteer world. He was photographed with a
Catholic priest. He repeated a telling phrase, saying government
``must not fear faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks after his fateful visit to Bob Jones University, in
fact, Bush appeared poised to prove his ``inclusiveness'' above all
else in the weeks to come. Aides said Bush plans to emphasize two
issues: faith-based organizations and education. Neither is new.
Rather, both were pillars of the original Bush platform that, with
time, took a backseat to tax cuts and family values. But many
supporters had hoped Bush would focus on them again.
</P>
<P>
   They are ``the two issues that show his heart,'' communications
director Karen Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   But they are also part of a larger message that McCain ripped
out from under Bush, stunning the Texan's campaign staff and
supporters, many of whom believed Bush could beat a Democrat in the
general election precisely because of the unifying quality he
seemed to possess.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the governor of the second largest state, became the early
favorite in part because of his relatively inclusive message.
Conversant in Spanish, he came into the primary with the promise of
luring Hispanic voters. After winning nearly 30 percent of the
black vote in his second gubernatorial race, Bush offered the hope
of attracting black voters from the Democrats, too. He even defused
the abortion issue, garnering support from foes of abortion even as
he refused to promise to appoint only antiabortion judges to the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   In a few swift weeks, however, McCain had changed the debate
from whether Bush was inclusive to whether he was bigoted. Using
Bush's Feb. 2 visit to Bob Jones University, a South Carolina
college that forbids interracial dating and whose leaders consider
Catholicism a cult, as a symbol of everything voters needed to know
about Bush, McCain painted a new, closed-minded picture of the
Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   McCain argued Bush was too narrow-minded to win the White House
against a Democrat. And Bush, confident his record would speak for
itself, did little more than say McCain was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the accusations at first seemed ``surreal.'' Or,
better yet, ``preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The real irony is, he's the one who's been inclusive all
along,'' said Representative John Kasich, the Ohio Republican who
abandoned his own presidential aspirations last summer and now
supports Bush. ``The reason I decided to support him was his
inclusiveness. I love his message of inclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Bush still faces hurdles in returning to that
message and overcoming the damage of his Bob Jones appearance.
Tuesday, protesters outside his victory rally in Cincinnati,
shouted: ``We don't study at Bob Jones U. Governor Bush, you're a
racist, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush seemed intent on seizing the message of inclusiveness
again. Claiming victory in the Virginia primary, Bush heralded the
electorate for ``rejecting the politics of pitting one religion
against another.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign is winning, and we're doing it the right way,''
Bush said. ``We are uniting our party without compromising
principle.''

HOW THE POLL WAS CONDUCTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (With ELN-RDP and ELN-ASSESS) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Election Day poll was based on questionnaires completed by
voters leaving voting stations throughout Virginia on Tuesday. The
poll was conducted by Voter News Service, an organization created
by ABC News, CBS News, CNN, Fox News, NBC News, and The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   The results are based on 1,832 Republican primary voters in 35
randomly selected sites across the state.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results from such polls
should differ by no more than plus or minus three percentage points
from what would have been obtained by seeking to interview all
primary voters who turned out yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Results based on smaller subgroups have a larger potential
sampling error. In addition to sampling error, the practical
difficulties of conducting any survey of voter opinion on Election
Day, like the reluctance of some voters to take time to fill out a
questionnaire, may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

2 MORE HMOS POST '99 LOSSES; RESERVES WEAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LIZ KOWALCZYK  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With Harvard Pilgrim Health Care already in
receivership, two more of the state's major HMOs reported Tuesday
that they lost millions of dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
   Tufts Health Plan and Fallon Community Health Plan also said
that their cash reserves dropped in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at both plans, which aggressively raised insurance
premiums in January, said they see hints of a 2000 recovery and
expect to end this year with a profit.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs must filed their 1999 financial reports with the Division
of Insurance by Wednesday. Harvard Pilgrim, which was forced into
state receivership Jan. 4, was granted an extension until April 15.
</P>
<P>
   Tufts's report, filed Tuesday, showed that it lost $41.8 million
last year, compared to $12.8 million in 1998, said its chief
financial officer, Richard Hallworth.
</P>
<P>
   The losses, he said, occurred entirely in the Maine, New
Hampshire, and Rhode Island operations, which Tufts closed in
November. Its Massachusetts HMO, which has about 970,000 members,
reported a surplus of $24.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue from premiums increased from $1.7 billion in 1998 to $2
billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year looks worse than 1998, but after we made the
decision to leave those states, we turned the corner and were
profitable,'' Hallworth said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been profitable in Massachusetts, and there's no
reason we won't continue to be. We've put the bulk of our problems
behind us, but that doesn't mean there won't be bumps in the road.
This is a very difficult industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Fallon lost $12.8 million last year, an improvement from 1998,
when it lost $21 million, according to preliminary figures. Fallon,
with about 222,000 members, planned to file its annual report.
Premium revenue grew to $544 million from $487 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected to begin our financial turnaround in 1999, and we
did,'' said Fallon's spokesman, Richard Burke. ``We certainly
believe we have the reserves to complete the turnaround this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim also aims to return to financial health this
year. But the future of the state's largest HMO and its 1.1 million
members is uncertain while state regulators decide whether they can
attract enough investors to revitalize Harvard Pilgrim, or whether
they must sell it to a for-profit company or liquidate it. A
decision could come this week.
</P>
<P>
   Important considerations for investors are whether Harvard
Pilgrim's finances have improved in receivership and if its
turnaround plan seems realistic.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the negotiations said that if the turnaround
plan works, Harvard Pilgrim would lose $5 million to $7 million
this year, versus nearly $200 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim needs cash from investors or a buyer to increase
its reserves, which have fallen to negative $90 million.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators and legislators have called for laws that would
require HMOs to keep a minimum amount of money in reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Tufts and Fallon both saw their reserves fall last year; they
used some of the money to make up for operating losses. Tufts ended
the year with $68 million in reserve; Fallon, with $32 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Turnbull, a former state insurance regulator now at the
Harvard School of Public Health, said Tufts and Fallon appear to be
on the mend _ provided Tufts escapes expensive lawsuits brought by
members and providers in the states it left.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely good news,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But ``I don't think it's time to declare the health plans in
robust financial condition,'' she added. ``They're seriously
undercapitalized and are going to need to be profitable for the
next couple of years before we can declare them out of the woods.''
</P>
<P>
   This month, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts reported
earning $61 million last year, on revenue of about $2.1 billion.

OF HUNDREDS TRYING, ONE STOOD OUT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 5) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ From the moment she enters in that siren's dress, it
is clear that what is happening is not just another striking
theatrical performance. It is the uncommon but unmistakable
emergence of a star.
</P>
<P>
   In the new Lincoln Center dance-play, ``Contact,'' reopening at
the Vivian Beaumont Theater after a sold-out run at the Mitzi E.
Newhouse, Deborah Yates dares you to take your eyes off her. And
not just because she makes flying through the air look as
effortless as a fox trot.
</P>
<P>
   It is because Yates commands the stage with an authority that
never seems arrogant, combining a playful grit with an elegant
grace that makes you want to know more about her. Likening Yates to
``a razor-edged Grace Kelly,'' Ben Brantley wrote of her
performance in The New York Times: ``She's not only dangerously
beautiful. ... She can act, too, projecting the requisite fire of
wistfulness beneath the icy exterior.''
</P>
<P>
   John Simon said in New York magazine: ``As dancer, actress,
woman, she is every man's dream and headed for a manifest career.''
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly why Susan Stroman, the director-choreographer of
``Contact,'' picked Yates out of hundreds of dancers to be the
mysterious, riveting Girl in the Yellow Dress (costume courtesy of
William Ivey Long) who gives the despairing advertising executive
Michael Wiley reason to go on living.
</P>
<P>
   Stroman said Yates showed in her audition that she had emotional
depth as well as physical technique. She also had that certain
something that made the choreographer and her colleagues feel as if
they had just made a significant discovery. ``She really was very
powerful,'' Stroman said.
</P>
<P>
   In case you don't hate her yet, Yates is also apparently just
plain nice. She never complained, for example, when she was stepped
on by some of the guys she danced with during rehearsals. Boyd
Gaines, who plays Wiley and is not trained as a dancer, said he
appreciated that, adding, ``Deborah was good about making it appear
I was leading, when in fact I wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to resent Yates for being perfect because she has that
irresistible story of small-town girl makes good. Born in
Jacksonville, Texas, Yates _ who will not give her age (dancers
never do) _ started dancing at about age 6. At 16, she moved with
her family to Austin, where she got serious about ballet training.
(Her father, who sells industrial cleaning supplies, and her
mother, a psychologist, are divorced and remarried; Yates has four
siblings between the two families.)
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Southern Methodist University with a
degree in communications, Yates joined a modern dance company in
Chicago and waited tables, performed on a cruise ship to get her
Actors' Equity card, and then moved to New York ``with a little
money and a lot of moxie.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, she became one of the anonymous high-kicking women in
the quintessential chorus line: the Rockettes. And she said she was
happy doing it. The Radio City Music Hall gig was her first big
break, convincing her parents that maybe it wasn't so bad for their
daughter to be in show business after all.
</P>
<P>
   But Yates was no wide-eyed Broadway wannabe. First, she is a
member of Mensa, the high I.Q. society _ she took the test in
college on a whim _ and has lately been on ``a Russian author
kick,'' working her way through ``War and Peace,'' ``Anna
Karenina'' and ``The Brothers Karamazov.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, she is acutely aware of the opportunity that ``Contact''
has given her. Yates has long admired Stroman's work, like her
choreography for ``Crazy for You,'' which emphasizes characters who
think and feel as well as move. And the irony is not lost on her
that, after trying to blend in as a Rockette, she has a role now
that demands standing out.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't an easy transition. When she comes onstage the second
time, Yates has to throw a door open with a bang before entering
the room. ``It took me three days to do it without giggling,'' she
said. ``Now I just love it. I think every girl should have the
chance to make an entrance like that once in her life.''
</P>
<P>
   People who work with Yates say the attention the actress has
been getting has not changed her. She still lives in the theater
district apartment she has rented for almost three years and still
sees the same man she has dated for a year and a half _ John
Mattey, who recently finished a stint in ``Tony and Tina's
Wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She leaves the theater in her sweats and sneakers, as if she's
untouched by all that,'' Stroman said. ``Though I think she carries
herself a little higher now.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, although Yates said, ``The fuss is all about the
Girl in the Yellow Dress,'' she also conceded that her life may
never be the same: ``It has been a seminal moment for me _ years
and years of training and all of a sudden you cross over. That's
not to say I won't go back to struggling, and I may have to wait
tables again. But now people know who I am.''

<P>
   GORE IN LOS ANGELES: Campaigning in Los Angeles on Tuesday, Vice
President Al Gore referred briefly to the fading campaign of his
rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley, saying it was time to unite.
Paying attention to the diverse ethnic populations in California,
he had an interview with Univision, which he was asked to conduct
in Spanish. He declined, saying, though, that he once ``was
completely fluent.''

   THE POLLS
</P>
<P>
   OHIO LEANS TO BUSH: In Ohio, the first independent statewide
poll of likely Republican voters taken since the primaries in South
Carolina and Michigan showed Gov. George W. Bush of Texas ahead of
Sen. John McCain, 53 percent to 36 percent. The poll of 386 likely
Republican voters, questioned on Wednesday through Sunday, was
released on Tuesday by the Institute for Policy Research at the
University of Cincinnati. A similar poll of likely Democratic
voters showed Vice President Al Gore ahead of former Sen. Bill
Bradley, 66 percent to 22 percent. The margin of error is plus or
minus 5 percentage points.

   THE REPUBLICANS
</P>
<P>
   BETWEEN GOVERNORS: Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma has some
neighborly advice for Bush. Keating, a devout Roman Catholic and
early supporter of Bush, has suggested that the Bush campaign
schedule a speech at a major Catholic university to counter any
hint of anti-Catholic bias that might have emerged after Bush's
appearance at Bob Jones University in the South Carolina primary
campaign. Noting that Bush was at a Catholic center in Cleveland on
Tuesday, Ari Fleischer, a campaign spokesman, said, ``We do
appearances at faith-based organizations all the time, so we rule
nothing out.''

COMMENTARY: NO HOOVES! NO TAILS! 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On Friday night the president was hanging out with
the cast of ``Hanging Up.''
</P>
<P>
   After a White House screening of the hit chick flick, he took
Meg Ryan and Diane Keaton and their kids and other guests for a
late-night tour of the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   He was at his most charming, telling Franklin Pierce anecdotes
and joking that a lucky Indian totem he had just been given had
come ``too late'' to do him any good.
</P>
<P>
   He got some calls from Hillary in Chicago, seeking advice on how
to react to the Amadou Diallo verdict, which had just come down.
Harold Ickes and some others in her campaign thought she should go
to the Bronx and make a speech on Sunday. Susan Thomases, who was a
guest at the White House, thought that was a lame idea. So did the
president, who told his wife that Rudolph Giuliani could speak as
an elected official, but Hillary should not grandstand at such an
incendiary moment.
</P>
<P>
   The president told his guests he was amazed that George W. Bush
had gone to Bob Jones University. He thought Bush had been very
badly served by his advisers on that.
</P>
<P>
   On politics, Bill Clinton is still a smart cookie.
</P>
<P>
   When W. started his race, he said that the gaps in his knowledge
didn't matter because he knew which advisers to trust. That boast
has not been borne out by his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, he does not connect what he does to get elected
with what's in his heart. He saw Bob Jones the way his dad saw pork
rinds _ just positioning. Now he's hurt, saying he didn't do
anything wrong because his sister-in-law is Catholic and Mexican.
</P>
<P>
   Once in 1988 I asked Bush pere how he could portray himself as a
good candidate for blacks, since he had silently watched for eight
years as the Reagan administration watered down civil rights laws
and never once invited black leaders to the White House. The vice
president looked genuinely hurt. ``But I helped found the Yale
chapter of the United Negro College Fund,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Boosted by the religious right and Big Tobacco _ which hate John
McCain's campaign finance bill _ Bush won big in Virginia. But in
New York he will probably face some questions from the Irish
Catholic community about the close friendship of Bob Jones Jr. and
Ian Paisley, the leader of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist
Party, who has denounced the pope as ``the Antichrist'' and ``the
great fornicator,'' and the Catholic Church as an instrument of the
Devil _ echoing the Bob Jones sentiment that Catholics are ``a
Satanic cult.''
</P>
<P>
   (When my mother was in law school, in the mid-1930s, a fellow
student from southern Virginia expressed surprise when he learned
she was a Catholic. Why, he wondered over beers, didn't she have a
mark on her forehead? ``Some Southerners,'' she recalls, ``thought
priests wore cassocks to hide their tails.'')
</P>
<P>
   Bush is still shaken by the Bob Jones tempest. He misspoke last
Friday at a press conference and declared, ``I denounce interracial
dating.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cleveland on Tuesday, he complained about John McCain,
noting, ``Oftentimes, politics is nothing but this ``he said, she
said'' type of politics.'' Pray tell, who's the ``she''?
</P>
<P>
   Bush does tactical penitence. He apologizes to John O'Connor,
the cardinal of a key primary state.
</P>
<P>
   At the Catholic Fatima Center he bemoaned the McCain campaign's
calls to Catholic voters about Bob Jones: ``It's the kind of
politics that John F. Kennedy rejected in the 1960s.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's campaign embodies precisely what JFK was battling _
Jesus in the middle of the debate, and Southern preachers telling
their congregations whom to vote for.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kennedy had to vow that he would keep church and state
apart. W. embraced the Southern preachers who fuse church and state
for profit.
</P>
<P>
   It was a thrill akin to watching Wile E. Coyote push the plunger
on a load of Acme dynamite to hear McCain tag Pat Robertson, Jerry
Falwell, Louis Farrakhan and Al Sharpton, all in the same breath,
as ``agents of intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator can pander and his campaign can deceive. But
he's irreverent enough to tell the truth about the reverends.

 _ SF CHRON  
 PG&AMP;E Stuns PUC by Lowering Gas Rates  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co., which recently was handed one of its
largest rate increases ever, will inform state regulators today it
is cutting average residential gas rates by $11 a year, The
Chronicle has learned.
<P>
   PG&AMP;E will include the lower gas rate, along with a one-time
credit of about $60 per customer, as part of a filing with the
California Public Utilities Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC last month approved a general rate increase of more than
$450 million to accommodate what PG&AMP;E had characterized as a
near-emergency in meeting the state's growing demand for power.
</P>
<P>
   The utility had warned that as many as 3,500 employees could be
fired and tree-trimming around electrical lines could be scaled
back without sufficient funding.
</P>
<P>
   Such threats resonated with the PUC, which approved the most
generous of three rival funding proposals amid concerns that a
lower rate increase would ``cut too deep into muscle and bone.''
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E officials were at pains yesterday to distinguish between
the latest rate increase, which will be applied primarily to future
distribution costs, and the gas-rate reduction and credit resulting
from past events. They stressed that there is no direct relation
between the two.
</P>
<P>
   But Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform
Network, a San Francisco consumer group, said the decrease in gas
rates indicates that the utility has no clear idea of its true
budget needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new gas credit just shows that they forecast wrong
before,'' she said. ``If they're telling you they need $100 million
and they're giving you money back from the last time they asked for
$100 million, do you believe them?''
</P>
<P>
   Hoge said her group will study whether to include the gas-rate
reduction as part of its pending appeal of the PUC's rate-increase
decision. The appeal is expected to be made later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be grounds to reopen the case,'' said Ken
McEldowney, executive director of Consumer Action, a San Francisco
grassroots organization. ``It calls into question all the
projections PG&AMP;E is using.''
</P>
<P>
   PUC President Richard Bilas said PG&AMP;E had offered no indication
that residential gas rates were heading down during the months that
the general rate increase was under discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that never came up during the hearings,'' he
said. ``There's nothing in the record about this.''
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E officials countered that they had discussed the gas rate
with PUC staff members but not with the five commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   Bilas had proposed a compromise rate increase of $357 million,
which the commission rejected. An administrative law judge who had
investigated PG&AMP;E's financial requirements recommended a $264
million increase, while the utility itself had originally sought
more than $800 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm flabbergasted,'' said Commissioner Henry Duque, who voted
in favor of Bilas' proposal. ``This is not business as usual. It
could be that PG&AMP;E was not leveling with the commission.''
</P>
<P>
   Utility rates are determined by forecasts of future use. In the
case of gas rates, PG&AMP;E estimates what its customers will need
based on predicted weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The utility is required to refund rate payments to customers
when weather conditions end up being milder than expected or if it
collects a greater-than-expected amount of revenue from increased
usage of its pipes and wires.
</P>
<P>
   However, this factor apparently was given little attention by
PG&AMP;E as it made its case to the PUC for higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very hard trying to get an idea of what was needed and
appropriate,'' said Commissioner Carl Wood, whose $453 million
funding proposal ultimately passed 3 to 2.
</P>
<P>
   Shelly Malekos, PG&AMP;E's manager of rates, said yesterday that the
reduction in residential gas rates _ a decrease of about 3 percent
for the average bill _ is the result of the utility having
over-collected from customers in the past to compensate for an
earlier revenue shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   The average customer pays about $30 in monthly gas bills.
Electricity rates, meanwhile, are expected to remain frozen until
early next year under legislation that deregulated the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Malekos said the separate $60 gas credit, to be offered in the
spring, stems from economies of scale related to increased usage of
PG&AMP;E's pipes by other energy companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The savings come from having sold more gas than expected and
receiving more revenue than expected,'' she said.

 _ SF CHRON   A Taxing Situation on the Internet 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Q: I have a small store and am angry that many dot-com companies
are immune from paying sales taxes. What can I do to lobby for a
level playing field so e-tailers pay the same sales taxes as
brick-and-mortar retailers such as myself?
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; A: You are not alone. A lot of businesses are ticked off that
their customers can go online and save 8 percent or so in sales tax
if they purchase from companies with no physical presence, or
nexus, in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``As consumers learn how to shop in a tax-free environment, they
will,'' worries Clifford Waldeck, who runs Waldeck's Office
Supplies in San Francisco. ``This leaves local companies holding
the tax burden bag on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Waldeck recommends contacting your representatives in
Washington, D.C., starting with Sen. Barbara Boxer, who has
endorsed extending the moratorium on taxing dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   Also check out the e-Fairness Coalition at www.e-fairness.org.
This Washington, D.C., group represents more than 350,000 retail
stores nationwide and explains some of the issues.
</P>
<P>
   Vertex Tax ``Cybrary'' provides detailed summaries of state
activity in the area of Internet taxation (www.vertexinc.com).
</P>
<P>
   At the root of the controversy is the 1992 Quill vs. North
Dakota decision where the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that to avoid an
undue burden on interstate commerce, merchants should only have to
collect sales taxes in states where they have a physical presence
such as a store, a warehouse or employees.
</P>
<P>
   (Most people don't realize that if they are not charged a sales
tax on an online or mail-order transaction they are supposed to pay
a ``use'' tax of the same amount. Consumers almost always ignore
this little-known law unless the transaction involves a big-ticket
item like an automobile, which must be registered with the
California Department of Motor Vehicles. And the California state
Board of Equalization doesn't go after consumers who fail to pay a
use tax on books, boots and most everything else ordered from
out-of-state.)
</P>
<P>
   The Internet tax issue is so hot that President Clinton
discussed it at this week's meeting of the nation's governors. It
has been festering since 1998, when U.S. legislation imposed a
three-year 3-year  &LR; moratorium on new Internet access taxes or other
levies on electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also created the Advisory Commission on
Electronic Commerce to consider issues associated with the taxation
of sales over the Internet. The Commission will issue its
recommendations to Congress on April 5, but the e-Fairness group
feels the deck is stacked against conventional stores. The panel
has 19 commissioners, including eight from states and cities, eight
from companies tilted toward electronic commerce and three from the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   E-Fairness proponents maintain that by exempting Internet and
other remote retailers from the responsibility to collect taxes on
sales to consumers in states where they don't have a physical
presence, it essentially increases the burden on other businesses.
It also hurts low-income individuals who are less likely to have
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: How much business are traditional retailers really losing to
their online competitors and how much less tax revenue is
California collecting as a result?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: Forrester Research says all 50 states lost $525 million in
retail sales taxes last year as a result of Internet transactions.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds like a lot, but the number needs to be put in
context. California alone collected $27 billion in sales taxes last
year. That was up 8.5 percent from 1998, according to the Board of
Equalization, despite the loss of about $200 million in tax
revenues resulting from sales to out-of-state vendors that were not
taxed. Incidentally, out-of-state Internet sales were responsible
for about $60 million of the lost tax revenues to California,
compared with about $140 million from mail order.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Internet sales are increasing faster than catalog
sales, but a new report from McKinsey &AMP; Co. suggests that consumers
are not that easy to catch online.
</P>
<P>
   The consulting firm studied the behavior of about 150 million
visitors to Web sites and 3 million customers and came up with its
first ePerformance index. It shows less than 4.5 percent of Web
visits result in a sale and only 1.3 percent of visitors were
repeat buyers in the second quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Many people fear that giant companies, including some of the
biggest booksellers, are setting up sham online subsidiaries to
evade state sales taxes. But a California Board of Equalization
official says the state has 1,000 auditors vigorously tracking
cases. ``If it is really a single business and the store says
`visit our Web site' or the Web site says `buy online and return to
our store,' then it is not a real subsidiary and sales taxes are
due.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many store owners are worried by Internet interlopers,
some state officials believe that most big online companies like
Gateway Computer eventually require a physical presence in major
states like California and end up paying sales taxes. They argue,
too, that forcing small online businesses to cope with some 6,000
sales tax jurisdictions around the country is not fair, either.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Financiers Leave Firms to Create Their Own Businesses  
 By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
After a dozen years as an investment banker helping entrepreneurs
launch their businesses, Abby Adlerman decided it was time to start
her own enterprise.
<P>
   In mid-1998, she created Visualize.com to sell limited-edition
original prints and photographs to fill the void between expensive
gallery pieces and mass-produced posters. ``I went from Wall Street
to wall art,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Adlerman is not alone. Hundreds of investment bankers, venture
capitalists and securities analysts have plunged into building
their own enterprises or taking top jobs with those who have.
</P>
<P>
   Many, like Adlerman, were high-priced partners with little to
prove by remaining at their investment banking firms. Peter Hunt, a
former managing director at Montgomery Securities who loves working
with wood, quit the merger and acquisition trade last year to build
CornerHardware.com, an online site for home improvement products
and information.
</P>
<P>
   Other financiers who jumped to startups include twentysomethings
who view a stint in investment circles as akin to an MBA degree. It
helps prepare them for life as an entrepreneur. In the Bay Area,
the roster of such financiers includes:
</P>
<P>
   _Will Clemens, 28, who spent four years with two investment
banks before joining one of the firm's software clients and then
starting his own company, Respond.com, in late 1998.
</P>
<P>
   _Andrew Solomon, 26, worked for Solomon Smith Barney for two
years, used his savings to try to launch his singing career and
recently moved to the Bay Area to merge his music and management
interests as director of business development for EMusic.com in
Redwood City.
</P>
<P>
   It's too difficult to say how well investment bankers do as
entrepreneurs because it's not a niche that has been tracked. But
Frank Quattrone, head of Credit Suisse First Boston's Technology
Group, said, ``If they've been part of building successful
organizations and observed how good decisions are made, then they
probably have the right entrepreneurial DNA.''
</P>
<P>
   Adlerman, who grew up in a tiny art colony called Roosevelt,
N.J., recalls receiving her first piece of art, a woodblock print
of a a &LR; horse racetrack, as an eighth-grade graduation present.
</P>
<P>
   She got the equivalent of an MBA degree from Yale and then, like
many of her peers, was drawn to the financial fast track. At L.F.
Rothschild in New York, she toiled on initial public offerings and
convertible debt issue.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Then she was lured to Hambrecht &AMP; Quist in San Francisco,
where she became a managing director head of private placements _
the final financial fattening step before startups launch their
IPOs. After that, Adlerman spent three years as head of H&AMP;Q's
thriving consumer banking business and helped Jeff Bezos of
Amazon.com and Howard Schultz of Starbucks take their companies
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I realized that instead of living vicariously through my
customers' experiences, I wanted to have the experience myself,''
said Adlerman. ``I wanted to do something more entrepreneurial,
more strategic, more growth oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Art of the Deal
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Adlerman started thinking about creating a business herself
after more than a decade helping others turn their dreams into
reality. The only question was what type of business.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on her longtime long-time  &LR; interest in art, it dawned on
her that art is one of the most difficult things to buy. And she
perceived ``a vast no-man's-land'' between galleries and auction
houses at the top of the market and poster and framing shops at the
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   According to Alderman, most galleries are ``intimidating
places'' that are loath to answer basic questions like explaining
the difference between a lithograph and a serigraph or why one
piece of art costs $1,000 and another $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted to make buying limited edition art as easy as buying
quality furniture at the Pottery Barn and, in fact, teamed up with
former Pottery Barn buyer Jen Lawrence to start Visualize in
mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
   The two wanted to demystify and democratize the fine art
business by offering limited editions of ``quality art'' for $100
to $1,100 online or though the company's direct mail catalog.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to pitching pictures, their Web site and online arts
magazine called Off the Wall provide offer  &LR; information and
collecting tips. The company has signed 350 artists to offer some
of their works exclusively through Visualize in editions of 80 to
300 autographed copies.
</P>
<P>
   Adlerman pegs the ``underserved art market'' as a $17 billion
sales opportunity. One of the biggest segments, she said, ``is
people living with bare walls and people who are still holding on
to their college dorm posters.''
</P>
<P>
   Visualize is targeting consumers as well as businesses that buy
art for their offices. Because it has lower real estate costs than
a gallery and can sell anywhere online and by mail order, Adlerman
pictures profit margins in excess of 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The profit equation is enhanced by the fact that Visualize
drives a hard bargain with artists. It also can produce much of the
art itself, including high-class computer-generated digital images
called  &LR; gicl &LR; e &LR; e &LR;  (pronounced zhee-CLAY) prints.
</P>
<P>
   After reading thousands of business plans during her investment
banking tenure, Adlerman said she did not have much trouble writing
a tight 20-page plan of her own. However, she said researching the
potential market took several months.
</P>
<P>
   One of the important lessons she said she learned as a financier
is that ``it is good to hold onto the equity as long as possible.''
So for the first year, Adlerman and associates invested $1 million
of their own money in the startup.
</P>
<P>
   The business was launched last March. In July, Visualize raised
more than $5 million from Brentwood Venture Capital, Hambrecht &AMP;
Quist and Venture Strategy Partners. It expects to close an
additional another  &LR; $15 million to $20 million venture round soon.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hunt also recently gave up a lucrative investment banking
career to try his hand as an entrepreneur. After 13 years plying
the merger and acquisition trade, he quit Banc of America
Securities (successor to Montgomery Securities) last April to build
CornerHardware.com, an online hardware store.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt, 36, attended Washington &AMP; Lee University in Virginia,
where he helped support himself by running the Campus Linen
Service. Then he took a trainee job at J.P. Morgan and enjoyed
working on deals like the sale of the Baltimore Orioles. The intern
program turned into a seven-year stint before Hunt moved west in
1994 to head Montgomery Securities' health care M&AMP;A practice.
</P>
<P>
   When NationsBank acquired Montgomery on its way to buying Bank
of America, Hunt began thinking about becoming an entrepreneur. ``I
always wanted to do something on my own,'' he recalled. ``I reached
the pinnacle of an investment banking career. And being bought out
by a bank created a difficult situation with more bureaucracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunt loved hardware stores. He also was keen on building
everything from wooden toys and outdoor play structures for his
kids to Adirondack chairs for his second home in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   So why not combine passion and profession? With some help from
Montgomery home improvement products analyst Bo Cheadle, Hunt
refined his business plan and was introduced to his current
partner, Richard Tanaka, former CEO of Eagle Hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Their company, CornerHardware.com, received $6 million in
first-round financing in August from private investors including
Alta Partners and Venture Law Group. Five weeks ago, the San
Francisco startup launched its business site, which offers 37,000
products as well as animated guides on how to build and install.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're marrying the service of an old-fashioned corner hardware
store with the selection, speed and convenience of the Internet,''
said Hunt. CornerHardware.com is looking for a second round of
financing and Hunt anticipates an IPO as early as next year.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Valenti, 40, also retooled himself as an entrepreneur after
a varied career, most recently as a venture capitalist at Rosewood
Partners. In 1998, he left the San Francisco VC firm, which was an
early investor in such companies as Noah's Bagels and Jamba Juice.
</P>
<P>
   Because his company is still in ``stealth mode,'' Valenti is
unwilling to divulge details other than to say it will manage Web
sites and distribution channels for specialty consumer products
companies.
</P>
<P>
   It took awhile before Valenti discovered his entrepreneurial
passion. After studying industrial engineering at Georgia Tech, he
served on a submarine and was a manager for several companies,
including Proctor &AMP; Gamble, where he worked the Pepto-Bismol and
Tide accounts. Then he got an MBA degree at Stanford and became a
consultant for McKinsey &AMP; Co. before landing at Rosewood.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, he and his venture capital partners were
searching for a CEO to lead a startup called Echo Online Networks,
when Valenti realized he wanted the job himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It dawned on me I didn't want to own a piece of a piece of
another e-commerce company,'' Valenti said. ``And I felt I couldn't
transfer my understanding of it and passion for it to someone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Redwood City company, still code-named Echo, has raised $9
million in venture backing from Rosewood, Sutter Hill Ventures,
Stanford and others. It has 35 employees and plans to launch its
service in June.
</P>
<P>
   Many other entrepreneurs are taking the corporate reins after
just a short stint in the financial world.
</P>
<P>
   Will Clemens, 28, lasted only four years before making the
switch. He joined Morgan Stanley as a trainee in New York after
studying history at University of Virginia, and then followed the
firm's technology investment banking chief Frank Quattrone out to
Palo Alto. When Quattrone jumped to Deutsche Morgan Grenfell,
Clemens left, too. Like other recruits, he worked around the clock
many days and occasionally fell asleep in his car at stoplights
stop lights  &LR; on his way home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun because we had a lot of responsibility,'' Clemens
recalled. But he figures the $125,000 he was making as an associate
was ``pretty lousy relative to the hours I put in.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Clemens especially admired the entrepreneurs at startups
he worked with, he left in 1997 to join one of them _ Advent
Software. The San Francisco company makes portfolio management
tools for the brokerage industry.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in late 1998, Clemens was talking to a former DMG
colleague now working at Hummer Winblad Venture Partners who
happened to be looking for a CEO for a new online shopping service.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens jumped at the opportunity, took the CEO job and
co-founded Respond.com. The Redwood City company lets shoppers
describe what they want and then get personalized e-mail responses
from businesses offering the specified products and services.
Already, Respond.com has raised close to $60 million in capital
from Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Access Technology partners,
Barksdale Group and others.
</P>
<P>
   Despite notable successes, one should not assume that former
financiers are able to pursue any dream successfully and forever.
</P>
<P>
   Take Andrew Solomon, 26, and his dream of becoming a
professional singer and songwriter.
</P>
<P>
   He toiled as a financial analyst in Salomon Smith Barney's
leveraged buyout division in New York after graduating from
Dartmouth. Then, after two years of ``living at my desk,'' he left
with $40,000 in savings to pursue a career in music.
</P>
<P>
   He developed his own Web site, pressed his own CD, worked the
club scene and met recording industry honchos and lawyers. He
received some positive reviews and sold more than 1,500 CDs.
</P>
<P>
   But after a year, faced with becoming a starving artist, Solomon
switched priorities to finding a job where he could combine both
music and management.
</P>
<P>
   He recently moved to San Francisco to become director of
business development at EMusic.com, a publicly traded company that
lets customers sample and buy music downloaded music over the
Internet.

NEW POSTURE FOR PHILIP MORRIS, BUT OLD SITUATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why did Philip Morris, a company that long regarded the federal
government as its arch-enemy, suddenly announce it was willing to
accept some government regulation?
</P>
<P>
   The company's new posture, many say, reflects a campaign to
recast its battered image. But it also comes as a number of events
affecting the tobacco industry's present and future are moving
toward a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   A Miami jury is about to render a verdict in a case that could
financially devastate some cigarette producers. The U.S. Supreme
Court is set to decide this spring whether the Food and Drug
Administration has regulatory authority over tobacco. And a
scientific panel is reviewing whether it is possible to produce a
less-hazardous cigarette, a decision critical to the industry's
future marketing plans.
</P>
<P>
   The company's new stance represents a sharpening of positions
taken in 1997 by Philip Morris Cos. and other tobacco producers
when they reached a $368.5 billion settlement of lawsuits brought
by state attorneys general against the industry. But that deal
collapsed and some of its provisions were not contained in later
settlements of the state lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the disclosure that Philip Morris, the nation's
largest cigarette maker, wanted to start talks about tobacco
regulation left government officials, anti-smoking activists and
analysts alternately encouraged, suspicious or just perplexed about
the company's intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great first step,'' said Jeff Nesbit, a consultant who
has long worked with anti-tobacco groups. ``But now there are some
hard questions that needed to be asked, for this industry has
practiced deceit and deception.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Steven Parrish, the senior vice-president of Philip
Morris, said that company would not oppose federal regulation in
areas like the marketing of cigarettes to minors, the disclosure of
ingredients and the development of cigarettes that may pose fewer
risks.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish said the company would still oppose regulation of
nicotine by the FDA as a drug. But that might not prove to be a
stumbling block because a failed congressional tobacco bill
sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., carved out a special
regulatory authority for tobacco within the FDA, said Nesbit, who
worked on that bill.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Aronson, the president of Aronson Washington Research, a
company that follows tobacco litigation, said she was confused
about Philip Morris' motives. But Aronson said that cigarette
makers face grave courtroom threats including a decision soon by a
Miami jury in a class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of all
Florida smokers. That verdict may y produce a punitive damage award
of tens or even hundreds of billions against Philip Morris and
other companies, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many industry analysts like Aronson said they believed that the
Supreme Court would decide that the FDA did not have statutory
authority over tobacco. But even with that victory, the industry
would face more legal pummeling from mounting lawsuits, including
an action by the Justice Department seeking to recover hundreds of
millions in federal health care costs spent treating
tobacco-related ills.
</P>
<P>
   Those legal threats have sent the prices of tobacco industry
stocks to some of their lowest levels in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Such threats apparently caught the attention of Philip Morris
officials, who began an informal round of talks about possible new
tobacco regulations several months ago. At the same time, the
company was stepping up a public relations campaign based on the
theme that it was eager to shed its past and confront the health
risks of its products.
</P>
<P>
   Aronson said that renewing congressional discussions about
tobacco regulation might give Philip Morris and other producers a
chance to devise a compensation plan that would resolve the
lawsuits against them.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of scientific experts assembled by the Institute of
Medicine, a division of the National Academy of Sciences, is
reviewing an issue that probably will be part of an industry
marketing strategy in the future _ the production of potentially
less-hazardous cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the FDA requested that the institute review related
questions, including the issue of what constituted a reduced-risk
cigarette and whether such a product was possible. This week,
cigarette industry officials and public health experts are to
testify before the panel, said Tommy Payne, a vice-president with
the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   While no decision is imminent, the panel's conclusions could
have a major impact on how future cigarettes are marketed. Any
claims that a new cigarette poses a lower risk than a traditional
one would require FDA approval and its jurisdiction over that area
of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Payne said that R.J. Reynolds is not opposed to some reasonable
congressional regulation of tobacco in areas like safer producers.
Mark Smith, a spokesman for the Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Co. said
that it wants to engage in more discussions with its critics and
public health officials but has not pressed for new federal
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been down that road before,'' said Smith, referring to
the 1997 settlement proposal that collapsed in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-smoking advocates like Nesbit said that the positions of
R.J. Reynolds and Brown &AMP; Williamson may not be consequential
because Philip Morris dominates domestic tobacco sales and the
industry's political clout.
</P>
<P>
   Just how Philip Morris will exercise that muscle remains
unclear. But one thing is certain. As the disconnect between the
company's public pronouncements and its statements in lawsuits
grows, Philip Morris is on the verge of developing a
multiple-personality disorder.
</P>
<P>
   This week, as Parrish was discussing the company's willing to
accept federal regulation, the Associated Press reported that a
psychiatrist hired by Philip Morris and other tobacco producers as
an expert witness in the Florida case testified that his review of
two smokers in that lawsuit showed that they were not addicted. He
also testified that he had never done any research on tobacco
addiction.

LEAPING LATEST HURDLE, COMPUTERS FORGE AHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If Newton's laws covered bureaucracies, he might
have written that once a federal agency is set in motion, it tends
to stay in motion.
</P>
<P>
   The parallels between physics and politics were on display
Tuesday at the command center of the President's Council on Year
2000 Conversion, where the chairman, John A. Koskinen, noted that
the United States _ and the world _ suffered very few of the
computer problems some people expected to develop on Leap Day.
</P>
<P>
   He took the lack of a problem as a sign of the council's
success, another victory after very few Year 2000 problems
developed over New Year's weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few days ago, Koskinen had openly discussed the
possibility of closing his shop by the end of March. But he did not
take the lack of serious problems as an opportunity to announce
Tuesday that his agency would fade away any time soon. ``We have
not focused on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert F. Bennett, R-Utah, and Sen. Christopher J. Dodd,
D-Conn., have suggested that the agency be made permanent to ensure
the security of computer-based information against attacks from
hackers.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether his agency should be preserved, Koskinen said,
``That's an option that will have to be considered.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Ricci, a spokeswoman for the Office of Management and
Budget, the White House agency handling the issue, said: ``We have
not yet made a decision. We are looking at the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's report on leap-year glitches, caused when some
computers were not programmed to recognize the day as Feb. 29 and
instead regarded it as March 1, was tiny when compared with the
report on the Jan. 1 events, which were themselves mostly minor.
</P>
<P>
   The seed of the Jan. 1 issue was planted years ago when computer
programmers coded years with two digits, leaving many machines
confused by the change from 1999 to 2000. The Feb. 29 issue has
roots in the late 16th century, when the Roman Catholic Church,
trying to adjust for an annual orbit around the sun that is not
exactly 365.25 days, decreed that years ending in 00 would not be
leap years, unless they were divisible by 400. Thus, 1600 was a
leap year, but 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not.
</P>
<P>
   Some computer people who knew a lot _ but not enough _ about the
exceptions got the year wrong; others who knew nothing about
exceptions got it right, for the wrong reasons. And of course some
programmers knew exactly what to do and why.
</P>
<P>
   All of that left Koskinen unsure until Tuesday what would
actually happen. In the end, the Coast Guard reported that it was
having trouble shifting messages into its archives (but no trouble
in transmitting the messages themselves) and some telephones with
caller ID were recording calls as having been received on March 1
(but most will correct themselves on March 2).
</P>
<P>
   At Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C., Koskinen
said, there were delays at some skycap luggage check-ins.
</P>
<P>
   When the final results are in, he said, perhaps a dozen
glitches, all minor, will have occurred in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, 1,200 of the 25,000 ATMs in post offices did not work
but were quickly repaired. And some weather forecasts in Japan were
wrong because of computer glitches, and some in the Netherlands
were correct but could not be sent out promptly.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching deeper to find another problem, Koskinen said that some
passports in Bulgaria had to be processed by hand because automated
machines malfunctioned.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen listed one last possible miniconcern. On Dec. 31, he
said, some computers may get confused because 2000 will have had
366 days.

 &HT;    Woman's free-spirited life captured in obit
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ There is an indefinable age at which folks
begin to scan the morning paper's obit section, not so much to see
who has left in the night, but to reassure themselves that whoever
it was, he or she was a lot older than they.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Smith, 1911-2000. OK. Old Joe had a nice long life and now
he's gone. But as the years pass, and the birth dates begin
creeping forward, edging their insidious way into our decade,
reality hits. ``No matter what you do, you're gonna' die.''
</P>
<P>
   That succinct bit of wisdom is just one of dozens of memorable
lines from my all-time favorite movie, ``Moonstruck.'' Cosmo
Castorini, a philandering almost-over-the-hill spouse (played by
Vincent Gardenia), is reminded by Rose (Olympia Dukakis), his
exasperated but loving wife, that in spite of his hussy and her
cleavage, he's not going to live forever so he might as well get
over it.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmo sees the light _ even though the awareness of his
mortality is a tough pill to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   Flash back to the early '50s when I was in high school. The
English teacher, in an attempt to stimulate a bunch of 16-year-olds
into thoughts somewhat deeper than hair and Saturday night movies,
assigned us to interview another classmate and write his or her
obituary _ truthfully and without exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   Obituary? Like in dead? We were dumbfounded.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, when the entire class showed up obituary-less and
worried, the wise woman smiled and told us it was OK ... that she
understood. ``You had nothing to write because you haven't really
done anything. But remember, you have a lifetime ahead of you to
remedy that.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, a reader in Massachusetts sent along a clipping
from her local paper that had caught her eye. It was the obit for a
54-year-old woman in a neighboring town. ``It knocked me out,'' the
reader writes. ``It made me realize that if I didn't get busy, my
obit would be 20 words long and as exciting as reading the back of
a cereal box.''
</P>
<P>
   ``... a musician, artist, and free spirit,'' the death notice
begins. ``Born and raised in Portage, Wis., she spent three
formative years at the Brook Farm in Roxbury, Mass., an idealistic
experiment in communal living.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a child she developed a love for animals, nature,
adventure, and drumming. Later, she ranched and made music in
Texas, and lived on horseback in the Ozark mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``She drummed with the Berbers of Morocco, formed a women's
commune in Arkansas, and played carnie in Rockland, Maine, to
finance the purchase of a lobster boat that she sailed to
Provincetown in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1977, she co-founded the Provincetown Horse and Carriage
Co., the town's first horse-drawn tour, and in 1979, opened
Gabriel's Apartments and Guest Rooms, one of the first women's inns
on the East Coast. For many years she hosted Friday sunset drumming
on Herring Cove Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``... was also a street musician, composer, playwright, poet,
boatwoman, restoration specialist, organic gardener, political
activist, breath-work facilitator and prolific artist in a variety
of media.
</P>
<P>
   ``She won the Hometown USA Video Festival, the nation's highest
award for public access television, for her drumming video,
`Weaving the Matrix'.''
</P>
<P>
   The obit ends with a request that instead of flowers, donations
be directed to a fund to help provide low-cost practice and
recording space for local musicians.
</P>
<P>
   The reader is sending a small check. And so am I.
</P>
<P>
   Tribute to a woman who had the courage to chase her dreams.

SPORTS COLUMN: PENALTIES HAUNTING `PROGRAMS' 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The wheels are coming loose at many so-called programs. College
basketball teams are hoping to hold parts together with chewing gum
and baling wire and appeals and briefs just to get through the
national tournament.
</P>
<P>
   After that, they'll just let attrition and penalties and
ambition and professional money take their natural course. Since
undergraduates started flocking to the crass-but-honest dollar
standard of the National Basketball Association, college basketball
has become a year-by-year proposition, now operating on day-by-day
eligibility bulletins.
</P>
<P>
   Or, sometimes it is even minute-by-minute. Tuesday night,
shortly before before St. John's took on Seton Hall in Madison
Square Garden, Erick Barkley was suspended by St. John's,
essentially on the orders of the National Collegiate Athletic
Association. This was the second time this season that Barkley had
been suspended for violating financial rules. St. John's said it
would seek his immediate reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley was originally suspended for two games for trading cars
with somebody who was identified as a family friend but who also
had ties to a major summer basketball league in New York. This time
Barkley was suspended for apparently having accepted between $2,500
and $4,000 to help pay the hefty tuition at a Maine prep school he
had attended for a year. The tuition had been paid by a committee
at Riverside Church that maintains a powerful amateur basketball
program partly underwritten by Ernie Lorch, a wealthy New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   Why Lorch and Riverside thought the payments _ which are illegal
_ would never be discovered is hard to fathom.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's had reported the tuition payment itself, and was
hoping for a light treatment by the NCAA. The penalty had to come
soon because the Big East tournament begins next week, and the NCAA
tournament the week after that, and then Barkley is liable to be
off to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's took a seven-game winning streak into Tuesday night's
game, having beaten Duke last Saturday, with another Barkley
scandal already hanging over it. Coach Mike Krzyzewski, appealed to
the Duke students to spare Barkley from their witty heckling,
which, by and large, they did.
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski almost never has to deal with indiscretions by his
Duke players, but he did feel a sense of vulnerability last spring
when three players departed with eligibility remaining.
</P>
<P>
   At other schools, college players were undergoing various
investigations, allegations, suspicions, rumors, confessions, mea
culpas and nolo contenderes and all that other good legal stuff
that makes big-time college basketball such a wholesome sight.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to make any kind of wage for their labors, the players
are hounded by the NCAA for every dime or favor they have accepted,
in all their youthful innocence, you understand.
</P>
<P>
   This has popped up at Auburn, Cincinnati, UCLA and Michigan,
while Connecticut has had its own discipline problems. The latest
incident was at Auburn, where the star forward Chris Porter has
been suspended for taking $2,500 from a sports agent. The story
coming out of Auburn is that Porter took the money to help keep his
mother from being evicted, which could very well be true, but
Porter is not likely to get any mercy points from the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn officials are now saying that they have been keeping
track of ``suspicious people'' who hang around the team hotels,
trying to do ``favors'' for the players _ no surprise there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sick of people who prey on young people and hit them at a
weak moment,'' said Cliff Ellis, the Auburn coach, surely not
referring to the high-minded practice of recruiting young players
for college.
</P>
<P>
   Many people want to do favors for basketball stars _ get them to
camps, get them into so-called amateur programs, get them into
college, alleviate problems at home.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, DerMarr Johnson of Cincinnati was suspended for
one game by the NCAA for accepting $7,000 from an Amateur Athletic
Union coach to attend the same prep school that Barkley went to.
JaRon Rush, the star at UCLA, took $6,525 from an amateur coach,
but when Rush agreed to pay the money back, the NCAA shortened his
suspension to nine games, making him eligible to play again
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Given the hardships and realities of life, it is no wonder why
players might reach out and accept tuition money or rent money. The
NCAA tries to maintain an amateur look, but it is a weary, grinding
business, and it is hard to imagine that anybody has any heart for
it.
</P>
<P>
   Most coaches just want to keep the vehicle barreling toward
March Madness, and deal with the details down the line. How long
can this system survive? &QL;

COMPAQ ADMITS 1.7 MILLION PRESARIOS HAVE DEFECT
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Compaq Computer Corp. has conceded that at least 1.7 million
of its Presario computers have a defect similar to one that
prompted the Toshiba Corp. to agree to a $2.1 billion settlement in
a class-action suit last October.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq, which is being sued by the same lawyers who won the
Toshiba settlement, posted software that fixes the problem on its
Web site Friday. It also began sending postcards to owners of the
affected computers notifying them of the software, which they can
obtain for free from Compaq's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for the Houston-based computer maker said in a
statement that its computers ``work as intended,'' and that Compaq,
which has sold 60 million computers, has never received a single
report of the problem occurring.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq had denied its products had the same problem as
Toshiba's. It had said, and continues to say, that it would fight
the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   But a letter entered into the court records showed that Compaq
has engaged in settlement discussions with the plaintiffs. The
letter, written Jan. 5 by Steven M. Zagar, a lawyer representing
Compaq, said that the computer maker believed it had sold 1.7
million Presario computers with the problem. Zagar wrote that the
information was being provided ``as part of our ongoing settlement
discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Toshiba shocked the computer industry by agreeing to a $147.5
million settlement because it, like Compaq, had maintained that no
customers had ever complained of a problem as a result of the
defect. The defect, which the industry has known about for years,
occurred in a chip that controls the floppy disk drive and can
cause errors in recording information. Toshiba contended that the
error can occur only in rare circumstances.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The lined note paper is covered in tightly spaced
German script, in blue ink. Meticulous diagrams of the Nazi
hierarchy are neatly labeled. And every one of the 678 pages of the
final draft are signed by the author, Adolf Eichmann.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was efficient, horrendously efficient,'' said Professor
Evyatar Friesel, the state archivist of Israel, as he showed the
last memoirs of Eichmann in his office Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Locked away for nearly 40 years, the manuscript was made public
Tuesday by the Israeli government as evidence in a Holocaust denial
trial in London.
</P>
<P>
   Eichmann, who organized the deportation of millions of Jews to
death camps during World War II, wrote the memoirs in an Israeli
jail in the summer of 1961 after Israeli agents seized him in
Argentina and brought him to trial in Jerusalem. He was hanged in
1962.
</P>
<P>
   For hours a day over a period of four months, Eichmann sat at a
small table in his jail cell and laboriously penned 1,300 pages of
an autobiographical narrative and philosophical ruminations that he
apparently intended to give the court and ultimately publish as a
book. The work is titled ``The False Gods,'' a reference to the
Nazis, and includes such detailed instructions as a request that
the book's jacket-cover be pearl-colored or dove gray.
</P>
<P>
   The manuscript, which includes drafts, diagrams and footnotes,
recounts at length Eichmann's defense in his trial: that he was no
more than a cog in the Nazi machine. Asserting that he was not
anti-Semitic but misguidedly drawn to the nationalist ethos of
Nazism, he portrays himself as an official with limited authority
who was simply following orders. One of his diagrams shows him at
the bottom of the pyramid of the Nazi hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man was fighting for his life,'' Friesel said.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical passage, Eichmann writes: ``It is normal that I who
was not responsible, was not the master planner, the initiator or
the one giving orders, should set out to defend myself against
these accusations.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``My position is the same as that of millions of
others who had to obey. The difference is simply that I had a much
more difficult task to perform in carrying out my orders.''
</P>
<P>
   In another passage, Eichmann wrote: ``I was obedient to the
leadership of the German state, because we were told and believed
that Germany had enemies intent on destroying it. The enemy's
determination to destroy us, despite the madness of our own
leadership at the time, weighed on my conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Eichmann wrote, the Nazis brought on ``the greatest
and most violent dance of death of all time,'' ruining Germany.
</P>
<P>
   After Gideon Hausner, the prosecutor in the Eichmann trial,
cautioned that publication of the memoirs could compete with the
verdict, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion ordered the manuscript
locked away for 15 years &UR;  &LR; at which time that decision was to be
reconsidered.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision was not reviewed and the document continued to
remain locked up despite a surge of public interest in the
manuscript in the past year. Friesel said that legal questions
about ownership and copyright prevented publication. Eichmann's
son, Dieter Eichmann, demanded that Israel hand over his father's
notes, arguing that they are his rightful inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   There were also concerns about the impact of publication on
perceptions of the Holocaust. An Israeli panel decided last summer
to release the memoirs, but in an annotated scholarly edition that
would, it was hoped, put Eichmann's assertions in perspective and
prevent their use to discredit the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   That process, which could have taken years, was hampered by
technical difficulties. In the end it was decided to make the
memoirs public immediately, after a request for the manuscript was
made by defense lawyers in a libel suit brought in London by the
historian David Irving against Deborah Lipstadt, an American
professor.
</P>
<P>
   Irving sued Lipstadt and Penguin Books for a book that called
him ``a dangerous spokesman for Holocaust denial.'' Lipstadt's
lawyers plan to submit Eichmann's memoirs, which describe the
deportation and mass killing of Jews, as evidence of the Nazi
genocide. Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein said that Israel, as
the Jewish state, was obliged to make the material public.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the manuscript has been sent to London, while a
photocopy and typed versions of the text in the original German
were made available at the Israel State Archives in Jerusalem. A
copy is also expected to be sent to Dieter Eichmann.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: SOUTHWEST AIRLINES' SUCCESS WITH ONLINE BOOKINGS

<P>
   Southwest Airlines sent an e-rocket through the travel industry
this week when it announced that a quarter of its passenger revenue
last month came from bookings on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The figure caught even the most enthusiastic boosters of online
travel somewhat by surprise. ``It's pretty amazing,'' said Philip
Wolf, president and chief executive of PhoCusWright Inc., a major
online travel consultant. ``We probably would have guessed it would
have been around 15 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   This may sound like pure number-crunching, but travel is now
among the top money generators in Internet retail commerce.
Southwest also said that its online passenger revenue was up 140
percent, to more than $250 million, in the fourth quarter of 1999.
Its galloping Web fortunes are being welcomed in the fiercely
competitive Internet travel industry as validation of the most
optimistic projections for online booking, which analysts estimate
will exceed $30 billion annually in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest, which consistently gets high marks for service and
reliability in surveys of business travelers, is by far the leader
among the world's airlines in online bookings, Wolf said. Most
major airlines are currently selling 3 percent to 8 percent of
their seats online, according to industry analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf credited Southwest's simple, user-friendly Web site design
as a major reason for the surge in business. ``If Southwest can't
sell travel on their Web site, nobody can,'' he said. ``They have
the simplest, easiest price and schedule paradigm in the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the airline industry, carriers are investing heavily
in their own Web sites to compete with the big full-service
third-party sites like Travelocity.com and Expedia .com, as well as
literally dozens of other sites, some of which are geared for niche
markets, offering, for example, the lowest last-minute fares for
those on a flexible schedule, or the lowest fares or hotel rates
for a specific group of cities. At the same time, other companies
like American Express, GetThere.com and even big travel agencies
like Rosenbluth International have been spending heavily to design
custom Web sites for corporations to book their own travel directly
from airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southwest raises the bar for everybody,'' Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, as analysts have tried to get their arms
around the evolving world of online travel, studies have shown that
one of the main drags on the business has been a widespread
consumer reluctance to entrust credit card information to an online
business. That is changing, however, Wolf said. ``Credit card
security is rapidly losing steam in terms of being a major barrier
to online booking,'' he said. ``Consumers are much more trusting.''
</P>
<P>
   The outlook, however, isn't all rosy. ``If I were an online
travel business, I would be more worried about privacy issues in
general than about basic credit card security,'' he said. In fact,
he tells people in the industry to brace themselves for negative
public reaction to security breaches involving online companies
that invade customer privacy by tracking Web activity and selling
information on personal preferences and online purchases. ``I
believe there will be a negative impact on the industry this year
over those kinds of security breaches,'' he said. ``But I see it as
more of a pothole than a detour.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of online travel, the big Web site that is being
developed by Continental Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines
and Northwest Airlines _ with 23 other carriers participating _ is
still on schedule to start ``late in the second quarter,''
according to a spokeswoman for Boston Consulting Group, which is
managing the project.
</P>
<P>
   But the big question is: what are they calling this thing? One
hot tip among analysts is that the site is code-named ``T-2,''
which is said to mean ``Terminate Travelocity.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, the spokeswoman said. ``We call it the travel industry
portal. It's kind of awkward to talk about this because it really
doesn't have an official name yet.''
</P>
<P>
   How did the T-2 confusion originate? ``Very early on, we called
it T-2, which meant travel, second generation,'' she said. ``Some
tech analysts picked it up, and the name has sort of stuck. We
don't use it anymore. I think some competitors have probably spread
that rumor to convey the Darth Vader image.'' &QL;

ALABAMA'S DEATH ROW JUSTICE SKEWED BY NEGLECTED DEFENSE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS 6th graf for clarifications: changing reference to states to
now include `national', and to insert `poor' in reference to
defendants) 
 (bl)  
 By SARA RIMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OPELIKA, Ala. _ The desk in Mike Williams' office is a map of
his busy small-town practice. It is stacked with cases. The
under-age Auburn University student charged with possession of
alcohol. The collection of rent for a local real estate agent. The
bitter divorce in which the wife, who is Williams' client, is
charging the husband with adultery.
</P>
<P>
   The case that does not fit is the one partially contained in the
cardboard box on the floor: State of Alabama vs. James Wyman Smith.
Smith, 58, convicted of murdering a convenience-store clerk, had
not had the money to hire a lawyer, and the court had appointed
Williams to represent him at his two trials, even though Williams
had scant experience in the practice of criminal law, not to
mention the complex, ever-changing, high-stakes subspecialty of
capital defense.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had not even read the entire death penalty statute
before his client's first trial in 1987. He had no money to hire an
investigator. The state paid him so little that in a brief to the
court he said he ended up making ``$4.98 per hour to prepare for
the defense of a human's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his office, Williams declared, ``I will go to jail
before I handle another capital case.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith died on death row Feb. 17, of liver failure.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the public across the country supports capital
punishment. But there is an intensifying national debate over the
issue of justice, focusing on the quality of the legal
representation provided to poor people accused of capital crimes.
At its sharpest, it is a question of whether some innocent people
are on death row only because their state, like Alabama, does not
provide the resources for an adequate or competent public defender
system.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-death-penalty Republican governor of Illinois, George
Ryan, recently called for a moratorium on the death penalty after
concluding that 13 innocent people had almost been executed, in
some cases because of dismal defenses mounted by incompetent,
poorly paid lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., recently introduced legislation
that set national standards to ensure that competent lawyers are
appointed for capital defendants. The Justice Department has
initiated its own review to determine whether the federal death
penalty system unfairly discriminates against racial minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Some states, like New York, New Jersey and Colorado, have
multimillion-dollar capital defender offices that provide teams of
top lawyers and investigators for people in death penalty trials.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum is Alabama, which, with a death
row growing at the fastest rate in the country, has no statewide
public defender system. Court-appointed capital defense lawyers
here are paid so little that many lawyers refuse the work.
</P>
<P>
   In cities like Montgomery and Birmingham, where the pool of
lawyers is greater, lawyers can remove themselves from the list of
those willing to be appointed to capital cases. But in smaller
jurisdictions, like Opelika, a judge can compel a lawyer to take a
case, or find the lawyer in contempt for refusing.
</P>
<P>
   So the job often falls to young, inexperienced lawyers, or older
ones who earn a living through court appointments, leaving many of
those charged with capital offenses with inadequate representation
at trial, and some without representation in the appeals process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically these folks are sent into battle underequipped,
undertrained and undercompensated,'' said Kevin Doyle, the New York
capital defender, who spent five years working on capital cases in
Alabama with the federally financed capital defense resource
center, which Congress has since eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Two people on Alabama's death row have been found innocent since
executions were reinstated in the 1970s. Nationwide, there were 85
such cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alabama is our top priority,'' said Elisabeth Semel, who as
head of the American Bar Association's death penalty representation
project in Washington recruits law firms across the country to
handle cases pro bono. ``The need for competent lawyers there is
desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   Numerous studies by legal experts of Alabama's capital defense
system have documented severe shortcomings, including lawyers who
fail to do the most fundamental tasks, like investigating the crime
and their clients' backgrounds and presenting closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
   The Alabama attorney general, Bill Pryor, a Republican, said he
had no concerns about the quality of court-appointed defense
counsel for people in death penalty cases at any stage in the
process, from arrest to death row. ``My judgment is that at both
the trial and appellate level, we face very experienced and
competent opponents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not had the problems they have in Illinois,'' he
added. ``No one can design a perfect system of justice. I would
like to have more resources for the young lawyers who come to work
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Pryor said he is concerned that the appeals process takes too
long, a criticism made by many prosecutors of their state justice
systems. For example, he said, execution is set for Friday, March
3, for Freddie Lee Wright, who has spent 22 years on death row
while lawyers appealed his case.
</P>
<P>
   The 1963 U.S. Supreme Court decision Gideon vs. Wainwright
guaranteed all defendants the right to counsel.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, the state appoints two lawyers to defend each
capital case. Each must have at least five years' experience in
criminal law, but this can include cases like shoplifting and
driving while intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers are appointed to cases, and paid, by elected judges
who, in this staunchly pro-death-penalty state, campaign on their
records of sending defendants to the electric chair. The lawyers
must also apply to the judges for state money to hire experts and
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The state pays court-appointed lawyers. The rate was $20 an hour
for time spent outside court, $40 for court time, plus overhead,
until last year, when it was raised to $30 and $50, plus overhead.
Next fall it goes up to $40 and $60. The payments are also approved
by the judges. Court-appointed lawyers in federal cases are paid
$75 to $125 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi, Texas, Virginia and Georgia also have relatively
low rates of compensation, and none have statewide public
defenders. Mississippi, which has fewer people on death row than
Alabama, pays a flat fee of $1,000 plus overhead for each capital
case.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, defense lawyers here said the money was so little
that they could not afford to prepare a proper defense. They often
spend 50 hours or less on capital cases; adequate preparation,
experts say, should take 500 to 1,000 hours.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One death row inmate, Donald Dallas, had eight court-appointed
lawyers before his trial in 1995 even began, one after another
bailing out because of money and time constraints.
</P>
<P>
   His first lawyer failed to contact him after his arrest and,
without benefit of counsel, Dallas gave police a signed confession.
He was convicted of murdering an elderly woman who died of a heart
attack after he robbed her and locked her in the trunk of a car.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Williams did a far better job than many court-appointed
lawyers, said Bryan Stevenson, a Harvard-educated lawyer in
Montgomery whose nonprofit Equal Justice Initiative office, with a
$575,000 annual budget raised through donations, is representing
more than 100 inmates already on death row.
</P>
<P>
   But appointing lawyers like Williams to handle capital cases, he
said, ``is like asking an overextended general practitioner to do
brain surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson said his office had won 60 reversals of death row
cases in the last 10 years; many of them, he said, could be traced
to errors made by lawyers on both sides, including allowing
racially discriminatory juries and prosecutorial misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   At his desk in his office the other day, Stevenson took a call
from Larry George, who is mentally ill and on death row for killing
two people. ``Do I have a lawyer yet?'' the inmate wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson, who said he and the four other lawyers in his office
are overwhelmed by the cases they have, told George he was still
trying to find him one.
</P>
<P>
   There are 187 people on death row here, twice the number 10
years ago, making Alabama's the third-largest death row per capita
in the country. The death row is expanding so rapidly that Holman
State Prison has run out of room, and 30 inmates are being held at
Donaldson Correctional Center while the space is expanded at
Holman.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Alabama sentenced 27 people to death, more people per
capita than any state in the country. California, with eight times
the population of Alabama, sentenced 31. There are 300 people
awaiting capital murder trials in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has said that everything about the
defendant's life must be taken into account in sentencing. The
defense lawyer has the responsibility to present all evidence about
his client's background _ mental impairment, difficult childhood,
work history, family life, school records _ in an effort to
persuade the jury to spare the client's life.
</P>
<P>
   But a 1996 study by a group opposed to the death penalty found
that in Alabama, court-appointed lawyers spent an average of three
hours trying the penalty phase.
</P>
<P>
   ``The closing arguments alone are going to last an hour and a
half, so that means they're not often presenting any evidence,''
said Stephen B. Bright, a lawyer who heads the Southern Center for
Human Rights, in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Bright handled the appeal of Judy Haney, an Alabama woman who
hired her brother-in-law to kill her husband after he had abused
her and her children for years. Haney's court-appointed lawyer was
so drunk that the trial had to be delayed a day after he was held
in contempt and sent to jail to dry out. The next morning he
returned to the courtroom, and the death penalty was imposed a few
days later.
</P>
<P>
   After several years on death row, Haney was resentenced, to life
imprisonment without parole.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson recently sought clemency for Robert Lee Tarver Jr.,
44, who was convicted in the 1984 murder of a Russell County store
owner. Stevenson contended that Tarver's original lawyer had failed
his client, including in the sentencing phase of the trial, when he
offered no evidence that might have elicited sympathy for him, like
the fact that he was a good father, had strong family ties and had
a drinking problem.
</P>
<P>
   This is not an unusual contention. What is unusual is that the
judge who sentenced Tarver to die later said he would not have done
so had he known these facts.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson's clemency request for Tarver was rejected by Gov.
Donald Siegelman, and the state asked in February that an execution
date be set.
</P>
<P>
   At his one-man office in Birmingham the other day, Wilson
Meyers, a criminal defense lawyer, pulled out a voucher he had
filed recently for representing a 32-year-old man who had been
charged with capital murder and had ultimately received life
without parole.
</P>
<P>
   His itemized bill came to $13,399, including pre-approved
investigator fees of $2,385.
</P>
<P>
   The judge in the case reduced his payment to $4,128, saying that
while Meyers had put in the time, his fees were ``too excessive.''
</P>
<P>
   After paying his investigator and paralegal, Meyers said, the
case would earn him $1,212, which worked out to $5.05 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not have the financial resources to absorb a cut of that
amount,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Opelika, Mike Williams has saved the letters Smith wrote
him regularly during his 14 years on death row, inquiring about his
three children. Williams went to his wake two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think he got a fair trial,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until after the first trial, Williams said, that he
himself fully grasped the legal issues involved. ``It takes two or
three of them to know how to do the fourth one right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been involved with five,'' he added. ``I've done my duty.
I'm not going to do another.''

NOTHING SIMPLE ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S PRIMARY
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Adds new 10th graf with fresh McCain quote, ``If they ...) 
 (See also MCCAIN-NYT) 
(nk) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Picture this: Sen. John McCain wins more total
votes than Gov. George W. Bush in the California primary next
Tuesday, as some polls here suggest is possible. California's
secretary of state, Bill Jones, a Republican who also happens to be
McCain's most prominent California supporter, would certify him,
under state law, as the Republican winner of the state's blanket
primary, in which the names of all candidates appear on the same
ballot regardless of party.
</P>
<P>
   Simple? Not.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 32b9 of the Republican National Committee prohibits the
party from recognizing the results of so-called jungle primaries,
in which voters of any party may vote for candidates of any other
by skittering down the very same ballot. So, state and national
party officials insist, all of California's 162 Republican
delegates will go to the candidate who receives the most Republican
votes, as determined by a second, computer-coded count of
party-members only.
</P>
<P>
   And so far, Bush has maintained about a 2-to-1 lead among
Republicans in the polls, while he and McCain are within a few
points of each other overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the loser goes the spoils,'' said Tony Quinn, a Republican
political strategist and expert on redistricting in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   That anomaly could conceivably produce the first real fight over
credentials at a Republican National Convention since the contest
between Dwight D. Eisenhower and Robert A. Taft in 1952, before
primaries became the main means of choosing nominees.
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds complicated, it is.
</P>
<P>
   Courts have consistently given the parties wide leeway in
setting their own rules and choosing delegates. The McCain camp's
only recourse would be for a registered California Republican who
could otherwise have been a delegate to file a challenge with the
party's nine-member contest committee, which would make a
recommendation to the full Republican National Committee. The
leadership's ruling could in turn be appealed to the credentials
committee, and could ultimately wind up as the first order of
business on the floor of the convention in Philadelphia this
summer. In that decision, California's disputed delegation could
not vote.
</P>
<P>
   But the party leadership is controlled by officials sympathetic
to Bush. Moreover, Bush, McCain and Alan Keyes have all filed
notarized affidavits with the California Republican Party agreeing
to abide by the results of the Republican-only count and to forgo
undertaking or supporting any challenges, so McCain would face an
uphill fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to choose a candidate who can't win the popular
vote in the state of California, that's a decision they would have
to make,'' McCain told reporters Tuesday. ``Obviously, we would
argue our case, but I don't think we'd want to have some big
delegate fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some Republicans here say there are arguments to be made.
In states like Michigan and South Carolina, any registered voter
may request a partisan ballot to vote in a primary. In others, like
New Hampshire, Republicans and independents may vote in a
Republican primary, but not Democrats. These are known as ``open
primaries,'' and while the party establishment may not like them,
it has accepted them in an effort to draw crossover voters who may
stick with Republicans in November.
</P>
<P>
   But in California, Washington and Alaska, western states without
strong partisan traditions, the names of all candidates are listed
on the primary ballot, allowing voters to mix and match, without
even a one-day pretense of party affiliation. Neither major
national party tolerates such heresy, and the Republicans adopted
their rule in 1988, shortly after Washington state adopted its
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a difference without a distinction,'' said Quinn.
``What it says is you can accept somebody who walks in in a state
like Virginia, and says `Give me the Republican ballot,' but you
won't accept our blanket system here.''
</P>
<P>
   California's system was passed in 1996 ballot measure,
Proposition 198. Its chief sponsor was Tom Campbell, then a
Republican state senator and now a congressman from Northern
California, who had lost a primary for U.S. Senate to a more
conservative candidate in 1992 and believed he might have won with
crossover voters. But from the beginning, the major political
parties here have opposed the measure as an unconstitutional
meddling with their right of free association. Federal courts have
upheld the law and the parties' challenge is to be heard before the
U.S. Supreme Court in April.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the parties sought to ``re-close'' the
presidential primary, first with a 1998 ballot measure that failed
at the polls, and then with a bipartisan bill signed last year by
Gov. Gray Davis specifying the two counts, one of the overall vote
and one of the partisan vote.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, a former Democratic state senator, Barry Keene,
filed a challenge asking the California Supreme Court to overturn
the dual-count law, on the grounds that under the California
Constitution, a ballot initiative may only be amended by another
initiative, not legislation. He asked the court to block the public
release of any partisan count next week, pending a hearing on the
merits.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Jones, the secretary of state, has argued that the
parties should change their rules to accept the blanket system.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE QUITS AT RELIANCE GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Saul P. Steinberg, one of the best-known corporate
raiders of the 1980s, stepped down Tuesday as the chief executive
of Reliance Group Holdings, a troubled insurance company that
announced another quarter of disappointing earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said that it had reached an agreement to sell
one of its healthiest businesses to Travelers Property Casualty for
$580 million to shore up its balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   But investors, who bid down Reliance's shares $1.25, to $4.125,
remained disappointed that the company was not taking more
aggressive steps, said David Schiff, the editor of Schiff's
Insurance Observer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Robert S. Miller, a turnaround specialist who
joined Reliance as president only three months ago, quit Tuesday
and accepted a job as an adviser to Aetna's new chief executive,
William H. Donaldson. George R. Baker, who had been a special
assistant to Steinberg, will become president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg, 60, will remain chairman and will focus on the
company's e-commerce strategy, including Cybercomp, which uses the
Internet to help sell workers' compensation insurance, said Lowell
C. Freiberg, Reliance's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   One of the central deal-makers of the 1980s, Steinberg used
Reliance to make unsuccessful bids to take over Chemical Bank and
Walt Disney and bought stakes in UAL as well as other insurance
companies. Corporate governance experts regularly criticized him
for the large salary he paid himself, which often exceeded that of
executives at larger insurance companies and which came on top of
the dividend Steinberg received as one of Reliance's large
shareholders. In 1998, he made $8.5 million in salary and bonus.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, Steinberg's star faded as Reliance had
one setback after another. Its attempt to expand its commercial
insurance business did not fully succeed, and a partnership on
workers' compensation reinsurance ended badly. Reliance remains
more heavily leveraged than many rivals, Schiff said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Reliance posted a fourth-quarter loss of $123 million,
or $1.08 a diluted share, compared with a $31 million gain, or 26
cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. The company lost $311
million in 1999 as insurance prices fell, compared with a profit of
$326 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The company announced Tuesday that it was suspending the payment
of dividends to shareholders and would consider paying them again
once it had refinanced its debt.
</P>
<P>
   But Freiberg said the company was now in a stronger position to
do better the next few years. In recent months, Reliance has
settled a lawsuit it had filed against one of its partners in the
workers' compensation arrangement. It also gained a five-month
extension from its banks on $238 million in loans that had been due
on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers Property Casualty, a unit of Citigroup, is buying
Reliance's surety unit, which helps insure against construction
delays. The $300 million gain that Reliance will realize from the
sale will help increase its capital _ its investment holdings minus
its anticipated claim payments _ to $1.7 billion from $1.2 billion
at the start of 2000, Freiberg said. Investment gains have
accounted for the remaining growth.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the company's debt and recent losses, insurance
rating agencies have begun reviewing Reliance's rating to determine
whether it should be lowered. A.B. Best said Tuesday that it was
upgrading Reliance from ``under review with negative implications''
to ``under review with developing implications'' because of the
improved balance sheet. &QL;

HALL'S SHUTOUT HAS HODGES FANS UPSET 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By COREY KILGANNON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Once again, as they say, they wuz robbed.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Brooklyn Dodgers fans have been pushing in recent years
for the baseball Hall of Fame to induct Gil Hodges, the team's
beloved first baseman who later, as manager, guided the 1969 Mets
to a World Series championship. But Tuesday, they learned that
Hodges had been passed over again.
</P>
<P>
   Wait till next year?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, fans of Hodges have been doing just that for the last
19 years, and many said that this year, with its lack of strong
contenders, was their idol's best chance to get into the hall.
</P>
<P>
   Many fan organizations and even Hodges' widow, Joan, campaigned
tirelessly to foster a groundswell of support to sway the members
of the Hall of Fame's Veterans Committee, which selects new
members.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 years after he last played in Ebbets Field, Hodges
still has a particularly strong following in the city, which has
named a bridge, a Little League, and a school after him. His wife
continues to live in the Brooklyn home the couple bought 40 years
ago, and Tuesday, family members gathered at her Brooklyn house to
commiserate.
</P>
<P>
   As the news spread that he was not voted in, Brooklyn Dodgers
fans registered their outrage by flooding Internet message boards
and calling radio talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought this year it was finally gonna happen, because the
field was the weakest,'' said Marty Adler, president of the
Brooklyn Dodgers Hall of Fame, which has a display in the Brooklyn
Historical Society in Brooklyn Heights.
</P>
<P>
   The group sends a quarterly Brooklyn Dodgers newsletter to 5,000
subscribers. Last fall, Adler, 63, sent 5,000 ``Cooperstown Needs
Gil Hodges'' bumper stickers along with the newsletters.
</P>
<P>
   Proving that there is no fury like a Brooklyn Dodgers fan
scorned, Hodges fans filled Web sites, Internet message boards and
chat rooms with elaborate theories on why their hero is being
snubbed by the hall.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph R. D'Agostin, who runs the Committee to Elect Gil Hodges
Into Baseball's Hall of Fame, in Norwalk, Conn., has a Web site
dedicated to Hodges' induction. He sent out mass e-mailings to the
network of hundreds of Hodges fans, urging them to write to the
hall. ``We want Gil to get his day, and we'll keep badgering the
committee until he gets it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday afternoon, Hodges was in tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an absolute disgrace,'' she said. `I'm in shock. Gil's
had more votes than anyone in history that's in the hall. I want an
explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodges, 73, began a campaign over the last year to get her
husband elected, she said, including holding news conferences with
the Brooklyn borough president, Howard Golden, and Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Marino Amoruso, a Hodges biographer, called the news ``a
monumental glaring injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``New York did have better ballplayers, but none more beloved,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges was 19 in 1943 when he played his first major-league game
with the Dodgers, and won the gold glove for outstanding defensive
play the first three years it was awarded. He played in more World
Series games at first base (38) than any player in the major
leagues. He died of a heart attack in 1972 at the age of 47.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gillie was beloved by everybody from Brooklyn,'' said the
former pitcher Ralph Branca, who roomed with Hodges when both
played for the Dodgers in the '40s and '50s. ``I'm very
disappointed, because he looked like he really had a shot this
year.''  &QL;

 &HT;    Bush courts Catholics in pass through Ohio
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTERVILLE, Ohio _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush barnstormed
through Ohio on Tuesday, blasting away at Arizona Sen. John McCain
and casting himself as the compassionate, tax-slashing reformer who
can unite the Republicans and win the White House in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I proudly stand before you as a uniter, not a divider,'' Bush
said to the approval of 2,000 cheering students and adults at
Westerville North High School in this Columbus suburb. He also
campaigned at the Catholic-sponsored Fatima Community Center on
Cleveland's east side and at a packed evening rally at Memorial
Hall in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   At the Cincinnati rally, Bush told 700 pompon-waving supporters
that he appeared headed for a big victory in Virginia and that next
Tuesday Ohio Republicans would have a chance to keep the momentum
going.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Buckeye State is going to send a signal that his nation is
ready for a fresh start,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also met privately with a small group of families,
including two from the Miami Valley who are in disputes with their
health insurers over coverage for their children. The plight of one
family, Ed and Lydia Bogan of West Alexandria, has caught the
attention of the presidential candidates. The health company
refuses to pay for the formula the family says is necessary to keep
their daughter Kaitlynn alive. She cannot eat normal food.
</P>
<P>
   During his Westerville speech, Bush named McCain as the
``divider,'' but lashed out frequently during the day at the
Arizona senator for phone calls the McCain campaign made last week
in Michigan, reminding voters of Bush's visit to Bob Jones
University, whose leaders have espoused anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign at first said it didn't make the calls but
later acknowledged responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   At a morning news conference in Cleveland, Bush said the McCain
campaign was making the same kind of calls in advance of Tuesday's
voting. Bush said the calls label him an ``anti-Catholic bigot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't appreciate the politics that still goes on by Senator
McCain,'' Bush told reporters after visiting a Catholic-run
community center in Cleveland. ``It's the politics of saying one
thing and doing another.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said, however, he regrets not using his visit to the
university to speak out against anti-Catholic bias.
</P>
<P>
   The invocation at the Cincinnati rally was given by the Rev.
John Putka, who teaches political science at the University of
Dayton. He attended the rally with about 15 students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe George Bush is anti-Catholic,'' Putka said. He
said, however, his vote is undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he considered ``Clintonesque'' about McCain, Bush
said that McCain ``demonizes people'' and holds them up to scorn.
</P>
<P>
   He was still fuming when the subject came up again in a meeting
with Ohio reporters after the Westerville rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that really what we want, name calling and slanderous
campaigning?'' the governor asked.
</P>
<P>
   He brushed aside complaints from McCain about phone calls that
evangelist Pat Robertson made on Bush's behalf, blasting McCain.
The calls were not paid for by the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like me complaining about the Sierra Club doing something
against me. Therefore, I'm going to do something against my
opponent. These are independent expenditures over which I have no
control,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor sidestepped a direct answer to a question about
whether his visit to the Fatima Community Center was designed to
shore up support from Ohio Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   He said he came to the center to ``herald the greatness of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   LaJean Ray-McNair, center director, said she didn't think the
visit would have been scheduled if the flap over Bob Jones
University had not occurred. Nevertheless, Ray-McNair said she was
glad to have the governor there to discuss education, foster care,
housing and related issue.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign aides said the visit was scheduled last Saturday but
that the center had been included on a list of possible sites three
months ago
</P>
<P>
   What campaign aides said could be Bush's last Ohio visit before
next Tuesday's primary here came as an Ohio Poll, conducted by the
University of Cincinnati, showed him leading McCain by 17 points,
53 percent to 36 percent. The lead is half the 34 point lead from a
poll taken earlier in February, but Bush still was pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm winning by double digits because I've got a positive
message,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   All day that message echoed the ``compassionate conservatism''
that Bush has tried to make the trademark of his campaign, uniting
government with faith-based institutions to improve lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the American dream to touch every willing heart,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   That touching can come with Americans paying lower taxes, he
said. Taxpayers, not the government, own the federal government
budget surplus from which a tax cut would come, he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has said Bush's tax proposals are irresponsible and would
benefit only the rich. Not so, said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to give everyone who pays taxes in America a tax
cut,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the topic of education, he said he would leave it to the
states to decide whether to have school voucher programs. But he
said, for schools that don't achieve success, he would take the
federal money they receive for special programs and give it
directly parents.
</P>
<P>
   The midday rally here showcased Bush's strong support from Ohio
Republicans. Gov. Bob Taft, House Speaker JoAnn Davidson of
Reynoldsburg, Senate President Richard Finan of Cincinnati and
state Treasurer J. Kenneth Blackwell all came to cheer on Bush, who
faces McCain in Ohio's Republican primary next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. John Kasich (R-Westerville), who withdrew from the
presidential race and threw his support to Bush, warmed up his
hometown audience for the governor.
</P>
<P>
   It was Taft, however, who predicted that Bush would prevail in
his second encounter in a Midwestern industrial state, reversing
his loss last week in Michigan to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also have a chance to send a message to that state up north
... The Buckeye State loves George Bush,'' Taft said.

INQUIRY OF ACQUITTED OFFICERS TO TAKE MONTHS FOR POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the four officers acquitted in the slaying of
Amadou Diallo has returned to work, but police officials predicted
Tuesday that it would be months before the Police Department could
complete an internal investigation into whether the officers should
remain on the force.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Edward McMellon became the first of the officers to
return when he reported to his desk job in a Brooklyn police office
Monday, said his lawyer, Stephen Worth.
</P>
<P>
   None of the officers, who had been involved in aggressive street
patrols prior to Diallo's death, have said whether they would seek
to return to full duty, although the lawyer for Officer Sean
Carroll said he believed his client hoped to resume his career as a
patrolman.
</P>
<P>
   To remain on the force, Carroll and his colleagues _ McMellon,
Richard Murphy and Kenneth Boss _ would have to pass an internal
review to determine whether their conduct in the shooting of Diallo
violated any department policies, such as a guideline that requires
officers to identify themselves adequately during street
encounters.
</P>
<P>
   But that review will not begin, police officials said, until
federal officials decide whether to file new criminal charges
against the officers. The Justice Department has said it is
reviewing the evidence in the case to determine whether the
officers violated Diallo's civil rights when they fired 41 times at
him as he stood unarmed in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been requested by the federal investigators not to
initiate the firearms discharge review investigation because they
may be doing their own investigation and they do not want any
compelled testimony,'' said Deputy Chief Thomas Fahey, a department
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers can be compelled to answer questions _ or face
administrative penalties _ in internal disciplinary matters, but
the statements they make under those conditions cannot be used
against them in a criminal proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said it would likely be months before the federal
review and a subsequent department investigation could be
completed.
</P>
<P>
   If the officers are found guilty of misconduct, they could face
penalties from reprimand to dismissal. Currently, they are each
charged administratively with ``prohibited conduct,'' based on the
original murder and reckless endangerment charges on which they
were indicted. Those administrative charges may be amended or
dropped as the investigation proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, the officers will remain on modified duty, in
which they are paid but are assigned to desk jobs, without the
right to carry a badge or a gun. The other officers, aside from
McMellon, are expected to return to work in a few days or weeks,
their lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike criminal trials, in which the evidence must show the
defendants are guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, in police
administrative proceedings the department must show that defendants
violated a policy based only on a preponderance of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident that that review will find the officers
blameless in the same manner that the criminal trial did,'' Worth
said. ``The facts remain the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the same unit of Internal Affairs investigators,
known as Group 54, that handled the criminal investigation was
likely to handle the upcoming administrative review. The unit will
try to determine whether the officers properly followed guidelines
and training bulletins that outline the tactics they should use
during street encounters and that govern the situations in which it
is permissible to fire their guns.
</P>
<P>
   The unit's findings will then be presented to a firearms
discharge review board, a five-member panel led by Chief of
Department Joseph Dunne, officials said. If the officers are found
to have followed procedures, the current charges against them would
likely be dropped, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   If the review board were to find that the officers engaged in
misconduct, their cases would be forwarded to the department's
in-house prosecutor for a disciplinary trial, in which the verdict
would be rendered by an administrative law judge. The judge's
decision in such a case would then be forwarded to Police
Commissioner Howard Safir, who would make the final decision as to
any disciplinary action, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Safir has spoken in recent days of his compassion for
what he described as the trauma the officers have suffered through,
he has withheld comment on whether they deserve to remain on the
force, citing the pending investigation.
</P>
<P>
   It is clearly in the officers' favor that they were acquitted at
the criminal trial, but the outcome can be different during a
disciplinary proceeding, in part because of the different standard
of proof.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent case, Officer Michael Meyer was acquitted of
attempted murder in the shooting of a squeegee man in the Bronx but
was later found guilty at a departmental trial of using excessive
force. He was dismissed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A discussion of possible disciplinary charges would become
unnecessary if the officers resigned, as the Bronx district
attorney, Robert T. Johnson, has suggested.But none of the officers
have indicated plans to do so.
</P>
<P>
   And Officer Carroll's lawyer, John Patten, said his client had
indicated he wanted to continue on the force, despite the angry
protests and threats that surfaced since the acquittals. ``He did
not indicate any desire to leave and he hopes to get back to full
duty,'' Patten said.
</P>
<P>
   James Culleton, the lawyer for Murphy, said he would have a hard
time advising his client to make a similar choice. ``He has to make
a decision on what he wants to do,'' Culleton said. ``But if I was
in his position, I would not want to be a police officer because
you would always be second-guessing yourself.''

 &HT;    Families battling insurers' refusals
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ At first, Angie King didn't believe it when her
husband, Mark, suspected their 6-month-old daughter, Erica,
couldn't hear. ``I dismissed it,'' she recalled, ``because there
was no family history.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, however, the couple observed Erica.
When the dog barked, Erica didn't startle. When they clanged pots
and pans, Erica didn't react.
</P>
<P>
   That brought them crashing ``back to reality,'' Mrs. King
recalled, and forced them to confront a harsh truth: Erica suffered
from profound hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``My initial reaction was shock,'' Mrs. King said. ``As a mom,
you feel grief that part of your hope for that child suddenly
disappears. My biggest fears were, 'What if there's a fire?' and
'She'll never be able to hear me say, 'I love you.'''
</P>
<P>
   The family needed a miracle, and they got one: A cochlear
implant placed in Erica's ear in May. The nickel-sized implant
serves as an artificial inner ear.
</P>
<P>
   Since the procedure, Erica, now 4, marvels at sounds most of us
never notice: a bird on the roof; a bathroom door squeaking open; a
refrigerator's hum.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would never know that she's deaf,'' Mrs. King said.
</P>
<P>
   The implant has given Erica nearly normal hearing. Her speech
and language skills went from ``age equivalency,'' her father said,
to well beyond it. ``With the implants she just zipped ahead,''
Mark King said, ``and we were ecstatic about that.''
</P>
<P>
   They were less than ecstatic about the $53,000 bill their
insurance company, Benicorp Insurance Corp. of Indianapolis, has
refused to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Their battle against their daughter's condition has proven in
many ways less formidable than their battle with their own insurer.
The Kings have sued Benicorp, saying the Ohio Department of
Insurance ruled that the implant was covered by the family policy.
</P>
<P>
   Their dilemma is now twofold: younger daughter, Jaime, 17
months, has the same condition. Will any hospital perform the
surgery with a pending bill from the other procedure? Can they
really go $100,000 into debt?
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are determined to find a way: ``If we have to sell the
house, we'll do it; that's how important it is to us for our
daughters to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Their case has received national publicity, including an
appearance on ``Good Morning America.'' After Mrs. King contacted
Gov. George W. Bush's domestic policy adviser, the Bush team called
the couple Monday night. They wanted the Kings to meet the
candidate Tuesday afternoon during a campaign swing through the
Columbus suburb of Westerville.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings met privately with Bush before the rally, along with
four other families.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' impressions?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got my vote. Need I say more?'' Mrs. King said.
</P>
<P>
   Was it genuine empathy, or politicking as usual?
</P>
<P>
   ``His track record stands for itself because Texas has numerous
programs for the hearing-impaired,'' Mrs. King said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush told us that Texas has an appeals board where
you can appeal your insurance company's decision, and that Texas is
the only state in the country where you can sue your HMO.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, however, won't need to rely on George W. Bush's
intercession. They're relying on their own considerable resources
and determination. Mrs. King, a stay-at-home mother who spent 10
years as an insurance adjuster, has already formed her own advocacy
group, Hear US, with its own Web site (www.hearus.org).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating, but I honestly believe all things happen for
a reason,'' Mrs. King said.

MIRAGE REJECTS TAKEOVER BID BY MGM GRAND  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mirage Resorts Inc. rejected a $3.3 billion takeover bid Tuesday
from its casino rival, MGM Grand Inc., as inadequate and
opportunistic, and it put in place a ``poison pill'' takeover
defense.
</P>
<P>
   But Mirage, which is run by Stephen A. Wynn, said it would be
willing to consider a transaction at a higher price ``that
recognizes the real value of Mirage Resorts.'' It did not specify
the price.
</P>
<P>
   That statement could be merely an attempt to mollify Mirage
shareholders who have been angered by Mirage's low stock price. But
it appears it is now up to MGM Grand, which is controlled by the
billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, to make a higher bid. It is also
possible that other companies, particularly Harrah's Entertainment,
will enter negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was encouraged by the fact that they are willing to discuss
a transaction,'' said David Anders, an analyst with Credit Suisse
First Boston. ``There was a chance that this would be just
dismissed out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The takeover defense would give shareholders the right to buy
substantially more stock at a discount if a person or group
acquired 10 percent or more of Mirage's stock or began a tender
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, MGM Grand offered to pay $17 a share, either in cash
or a combination of cash and stock, for Mirage shares, which had
been trading at about $11. The combined company would be a
powerhouse on the Las Vegas Strip and the second-largest gambling
company in the nation behind Park Place Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn was expected to reject the offer and try to hold onto his
empire, setting up a possible clash between two titans of the
casino industry, although MGM Grand has said that it wants a
friendly merger.
</P>
<P>
   After the Mirage board met Tuesday at the company's Bellagio
Hotel in Las Vegas, it issued a statement saying that the bid had
come at a time when casino company stocks were weak, Mirage's in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   But, the statement said, ``Mirage would be willing to consider a
transaction which would fairly reflect the long-term values
inherent in the Mirage properties, brand name and good will, rather
than an opportunistic bid which is timed to maximize values for the
bidder.''
</P>
<P>
   Mirage shares fell 18.75 cents, to $15.75, Tuesday, while MGM
Grand declined 31.25 cents, to $19.875. Mirage issued its statement
after the close of trading.

BOEING STUDYING 70-SEAT VERSION OF 717 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co. is studying a possible 70-seat version
of its new 717 which, if developed, would out the aerospace giant
smack in the middle of new and risky territory _ the hotly
contested market for regional jets.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the 100-seat boundary has separated the two biggest
guys in the industry _ Boeing and Airbus _ from the smaller
regional jetmakers such as Bombardier of Canada, Embraer of Brazil
and Fairchild of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But with the regional market booming, Boeing is at least
exploring the possibility of dramatically shrinking the 717-200,
which can seat around 117 passengers in two classes.
</P>
<P>
   Although analysts believe the company will decide against making
any such move, detailed configuration studies are under way for a
shortened 717, said Thomas Croslin, the program's chief engineer in
Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to determine if it needs to be 80 or 70 seats,''
he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Boeing's marketing people are conducting a
broad-ranging study of the regional market, Croslin said. The
study, which will make recommendations, should be finished before
mid year.
</P>
<P>
   Shrinking a commercial jetliner has been done successfully by
Airbus and Boeing with the A320 and 737 respectively. But it is
much more difficult to shrink a plane and keep it as efficient as
the original design since it will carry fewer revenue-producing
passengers and less cargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to take an airplane that is designed to carry more than
106 passengers and shrink it down to a 70-seater would give you a
plane that is not optimized for efficiency,'' said Paul Nisbet,
aerospace analyst with JSA Research in Newport, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would seem to me that Boeing's studies would rule this out.
I would be very surprised if they went ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing inherited the 717 program when it acquired McDonnell
Douglas in 1997. The 717 was then known as the MD-95 and was
developed as a replacement plane for older DC-9s still in service
with many airlines around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives have said before they are considering a ``717
family'' consisting of the current 717-200 as well as a stretched
version that would seat upwards of 125 passengers and a shorter
model that would seat from 80 to 90 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   But they have not previously discussed, at least publicly, a
possible 70-seater.
</P>
<P>
   Croslin said Boeing's goal is to win 1,000 orders for the
717-200, and about 500 orders for the two variants, assuming they
are developed.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, Boeing has received only 130 firm orders for
the 717-200. Of those, 50 came from launch customer AirTran
(formerly ValueJet) and 50 came from TWA. Each airline also placed
options for 50 more.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has an aggressive cost-cutting program under way that
could make a 70-seater competitive, Croslin said. The goal, he
said, is to reduce production costs up to 10 percent by plane
number 100; 20 percent by plane number 200; and 30 percent by plane
number 300.
</P>
<P>
   Lean-manufacturing programs are in place at Boeing's production
factory in Long Beach, and the company is working closely with
suppliers to get their costs down, Croslin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have teams out all over the world'' Croslin said. ``I have
a team over in Italy this week. We will have teams in Japan and
Taiwan next week.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if Boeing is able to meet its cost reduction goals,
analysts are not sure the company should even be thinking about
entering the regional market with a 70-seater.
</P>
<P>
   The competition could not be hotter. Regional manufacturers had
a record 669 firm orders in 1999, with conditional orders for 568
more planes.
</P>
<P>
   At last year's Paris Air show, it was not Boeing or Airbus that
announced the most new orders in terms of dollar value, but Embraer
and Bombardier.
</P>
<P>
   Fairchild Aerospace is also a big player in the regional market.
</P>
<P>
   All three are producing 70-seat jets, or plan to do so. They are
looking at stretched versions that seat more than 100 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question for Boeing is can they be sure the market is
sufficient to support another aircraft in that size class,'' said
Peter Jacobs, analyst with the Ragen Mackenzie Group in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Nisbet is more blunt. He noted that the regional jet
manufacturers are heavily subsidized by their respective
governments, which would make it tough for Boeing to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Only one regional airplane is produced in the United States, he
noted. That's a 19-seater from Raytheon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only one that has been able to coexist and make money
against these subsidized planes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Nisbet does see possibilities for a 717 that would seat from
85 to 90 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see perhaps a family of the 717 from about 85 seats up
to 125 or more on the other end,'' he said. ``I can understand
that. But going down to 70 seats seems like a huge stretch, or in
this case a shrink. Why they want to take the 717 down to 70 seats
and get right in the middle of a hornet's nest I don't know.''

SHOWCASING A RISE FROM REBELLION TO RESPECTABILITY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 5) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Renzo Piano chuckled as he remembered how he and Richard
Rogers were ``young boys, really young and quite bad boys'' in 1971
when they won the architecture competition for the Georges Pompidou
Center with a design that they considered a parody of technology.
</P>
<P>
   Their aim was to create a sort of anti-monument, a cultural
center that was anything but institutional in appearance, and the
proof of their success was the outcry that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even now, at 62, Piano, a good-natured Italian, seemed
amazed that France allowed two young foreigners _ he was 33 and his
British partner was 37 _ to challenge the sober 18th-century stone
facades of eastern Paris with an immense metallic structure
variously described (by its critics) as a refinery or an ocean
liner and (by its architects) as ``a Jules Verne spaceship that
can't fly.'' An international jury chose the design, but the French
government nonetheless accepted it.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Pompidou was very courageous, that's for sure,''
Piano recalled with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that was almost 30 years ago, and time has a way of
spawning respectability. The Pompidou Center finally opened in
1977, it proved immensely popular and today it (italics)is(end
italics) a monument. Piano in turn made his name, his long black
beard gave way to a salt-and-pepper stubble and he collected
architectural honors, including the highly regarded Pritzker Prize
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   So it seems altogether appropriate that the center should now
play host to the largest retrospective to date of his prolific
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``This exhibition is a bit like an incestuous relationship with
the building,'' Piano said while guiding a visitor around the show,
which runs here through March 20. ``It will then go to the Neue
Nationalgalerie in Berlin, Mies van der Rohe's building. There it
will be like going into a Greek temple.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, which includes scores of models, drawings,
videos and photographs of Piano's principal projects, will be on
display in Berlin from June 1 to Aug. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's interest in his work is hardly accidental. The Renzo
Piano Building Workshop, as his Paris- and Genoa-based practice is
called, has recently given new form to what was the prewar heart of
Berlin by designing both the overall plan and eight of the
buildings of the Potsdamer Platz, the largest new urban complex to
rise in the reunified German capital.
</P>
<P>
   But if the first exhibit in the Paris show is dedicated to the
Pompidou Center, it is not only because this project began Piano's
international career. For the last few years he has again been busy
here, building a reconstitution of Brancusi's studio at one end of
the sloping plaza in front of the center, then overseeing
repainting of the entire structure and, most recently, playing a
central role in reorganizing and renovating the center. After 27
months' work, the center reopened on Jan. 1, with additional space
given over to its public library and modern art museum.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Piano is happy with everything that has changed. Both
he and Mr. Rogers have criticized the decision to end free access
by escalator to a viewing platform overlooking Paris. On the other
hand, Piano has suggested, only half-jokingly, that the center
close every 25 years so its function can be rethought. And the fact
that it can be easily rearranged, he noted, is a tribute to its
flexibility. Indeed, one new space is the 15,000-square-foot south
gallery that houses his show.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition's curator, Olivier Cinqualbre, who has worked
closely with Piano and his workshop, has chosen to present the
architect's projects not chronologically but rather around three
broad themes: invention, urbanism and sensitivity. Models and other
illustrations of completed buildings are spread over some 20
tables, each hanging by wires from the ceiling, while a half-dozen
wall panels around the gallery show drawings of projects still at
the design stage, among them new buildings for Harvard University's
art museums and for the Nasher Sculpture Center in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't show everything, we can't say everything,''
Cinqualbre explained. ``Rather, we want to show the visitor as
clearly as possible how Renzo and his workshop work and have worked
for 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Piano likes to describe the exhibition as ``the imaginary
city,'' which seems reasonable enough because it contains examples
of just about everything found in a modern metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   In the section on invention, for instance, there are displays of
the San Nicola soccer stadium in Bari, Italy; of the milelong
terminal at Kansai International Airport in Osaka, Japan; of a
commercial center in Nola, outside Naples, inspired by the conical
shape of Mount Vesuvius; of a gigantic shell-like church being
built at the shrine to the Italian mystic Padre Pio in San Giovanni
Rotonda, Italy; and of office and residential towers overlooking
the Botanical Gardens in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The section on urbanism naturally includes the Pompidou Center
and the Potsdamer Platz, both catalysts for urban transformation.
In the case of the renovation of the old port in Piano's hometown,
Genoa, to mark the 500th anniversary of the voyage of another
native son, Christopher Columbus, urban improvement was the
principal objective.
</P>
<P>
   With the old Fiat-Lingotto factory in Turin, Italy, the aim was
to preserve the structure of an admired 1925 industrial building
while converting its space into a convention center and hotel.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The section on sensitivity presumably covers those projects
closest to Piano's heart. One of these is the widely acclaimed
museum that he built in Houston in the mid-1980's for the art
patron Dominique de Menil, to house the Menil Collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was very much about atmosphere,'' Piano said, standing
beside a model of the museum, ``trying to balance the presence of
art and the beauty of the building. Some people believe that to
make a good building for art, you have to make white boxes. This is
absolutely not true. You kill art by making a neutral building.
Others believe you must compete with the art, and I think that is
also very wrong. So you have to find the balance. What we worked on
here was the idea of creating space with a lot of character, not
for formal reasons, but for immaterial reasons, such as the sense
of lightness, the sense of transparency.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, this same approach was used in his elegantly
simple design of a museum for the Beyeler Foundation in Basel,
Switzerland, with its naturally lighted galleries and its large
windows looking out onto the surrounding countryside.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the project that has most excited Piano is one
that even his closest admirers have probably seen only in models
and photographs: the Jean-Marie Tjibaou Cultural Center in Noumea
on New Caledonia, a French-run island in the Pacific. Commissioned
by the French government, Piano took his inspiration from
traditional Kanak tribal huts and designed eight semicircular
wooden structures, varying in height from 60 to 90 feet, that seem
to float over low-lying exhibition spaces.
</P>
<P>
   The building looks like nothing Piano has designed before. On
the other hand, even with wooden models giving a certain uniformity
to the exhibition, what is most striking is the absence of a Renzo
Piano ``look.'' While Rogers echoed the Pompidou Center in his
Lloyd's of London building in the mid-1980s, Piano set off
simultaneously in several directions.
</P>
<P>
   His upbringing offers one explanation. His father was a Genoa
builder and, although young Renzo chose architecture, he always
felt close to the crafts and materials used in construction. Thus,
unlike architects with an artistic background who are often more
concerned about how buildings look, he is among those who approach
architecture through engineering or construction and are more
interested in how buildings are made. So a ``look'' has never
interested Piano.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think style is a very dangerous concept,'' he said. ``It's a
narcissistic attitude. Why should you worry about style? Worry
about coherence. That is a better idea. Style is like a rubber
stamp, a designer label; it becomes quite commercial. Even artists
like Giacometti, in his later years, he was trapped by people
telling him, `I want this.' So style becomes a limitation, a sort
of golden cage, in which you worry about being recognized. What I
like about the Menil Collection is that the building is a portrait
of the client, not of the architect.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, reassuringly, he seems all too aware of the potentially
dangerous power enjoyed by architects.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a bad writer, no one reads your book,'' he said.
``If you're a bad musician, no one listens to your music. But if
you're a bad architect, you impose something on a city forever. I
believe architecture can transform life, it is a utopia, it can
bring lightness and beauty and poetry. But the architect has a
great responsibility. Aesthetics and ethics are very much
connected, but I didn't understand that when I was 30 or when I was
40 or when I was 50.''
</P>
<P>
   Having caused a furor with the Pompidou Center in his 30s, Piano
now looks back with some alarm at how little he knew at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' he said, ``my feeling is that you should live as
an architect only after you are 50 because for the first 50 years
you just learn. I am not joking. You learn and you make so many
mistakes. Then, when you reach 50, maybe you can work properly for
50 years.'' He paused to light his pipe and smiled. ``And after
that maybe you have another 50 years to teach other people.''

BUSH CRUISES TO CONVINCING WIN OVER MCCAIN IN VIRGINIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH AND JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEESBURG, Va. _ In a race suffused with religious overtones,
George W. Bush harnessed his ties to social conservatives to secure
a convincing Virginia primary win Tuesday over Senator John McCain,
who appears to have hobbled his chances here with his criticism of
Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also claimed victory in the party caucus in North Dakota,
though no official tally was in. Results from the Washington state
primary that included both Republicans and Democrats were still
being tabulated, although Vice President Al Gore was expected, even
by his opponent Bill Bradley, to prevail on the Democratic side.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats now set their sights on the 16 state primary and
caucus blitz next Tuesday, the climax of the foreshortened
political season and perhaps the day the Democratic nominee will
emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the three GOP contests Tuesday, with 87 delegates at
stake, set the stage for next week's 613-delegate ``Super Tuesday''
round of GOP primaries and caucuses that stretch from California to
New England.
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, with 99 percent of precincts reporting, Bush had 53
percent and McCain 44 percent. Former ambassador Alan Keyes ran a
distant third, with 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   No official results from North Dakota were immediately
available, but unofficial tallies from caucuses convinced the Bush
campaign that the Texas governor would win handily.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Virginia victory, while expected, won him all that
state's 56 delegates, and provided a boost to a campaign still
reeling from losses to McCain a week ago in Michigan and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight, in an open primary, by a solid margin . . . the
voters of Virginia rejected the politics of pitting one religion
against another,'' Bush told a rally in Cincinnati. ``This campaign
is winning, and we are doing it the right way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight, we are one step closer to victory,'' an ebullient
Bush added.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, after calling Bush to congratulate him for the Virginia
victory, played down the results, noting that Bush's two victories
in contested states come in South Carolina and Virginia. (Bush also
won Delaware and Iowa, where McCain did not compete). McCain's big
wins have been in New Hampshire, Michigan, and his home state of
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I congratulate him on his victory,'' McCain said. ``It seems
as if he has a Southern strategy here, doing well in Southern
states. And we'll look forward to Super Tuesday, when we have a
broad cross section of America voting, all on that same day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were way behind in Virginia all along. I don't think it has
much effect at all,'' McCain said. ``Most people in Super Tuesday
states are not going to be affected by Virginia and Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Religion was clearly the key factor in the Virginia race. Exit
polls showed that Bush won a remarkable 83 percent of those who
described themselves as members of the ``religious right.'' McCain,
who on Monday blasted Robertson for moving the Republican Party too
far to the right, won only 10 percent of the religious right vote.
</P>
<P>
   But exit polls also showed that 79 percent of Virginia voters
did not identify themselves as members of the religious right.
Among this huge bloc, McCain won by 49 percent to 48 percent,
giving him hope that he can perform better in states with fewer
religious conservatives. That result showed how important it was
for Bush to win this constituency.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's biggest problem in Virginia was that he didn't draw
enough support from non-Republicans, as he did in Michigan a week
ago. Only 8 percent of those voting in Virginia's open primary were
Democrats, compared to 18 percent in Michigan. Another 27 percent
of voters were independents, who backed McCain by a 3-to-1 margin.
McCain also showed limited ability to attract his fellow
Republicans, who made up two-thirds of the Virginia electorate
Tuesday. As happened in Michigan, Bush easily beat McCain among
Republicans by a 3-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Stuart Rothenberg said that while McCain's
attack on Robertson was a ``reasonable gamble'' that may still pay
dividends in other states, it had an ``over the top'' appearance
that clearly hurt him among core Republicans, especially in
conservative Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to a lot of Republicans here in Virginia that he is
in the middle of a jihad,'' Rothenberg said, referring to a term
that means ``holy war.'' ``He allowed Bush to come out as a more
tempered, measured unifying figure.''
</P>
<P>
   Another analyst, Larry Sabato, professor of political science at
the University of Virginia, said McCain's attack on Robertson went
``too far for Virginia'' and ``really hurt the effort he was making
to attract more Republicans to his cause. It doesn't look good.''
But Sabato said it still possible that ``McCain may get a payoff of
some sort in the Northeast and New York and on the West Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign, while benefiting from positive publicity
after last week's wins, still faced the quandary of how to attract
Republican voters. McCain received one-third of the GOP vote in
Michigan, winning only as a result of that state's open primary
system that invited participation of Democrats and independents.
Many states with upcoming votes do not allow Democrats to vote in
the GOP contest, and some don't allow independents.
</P>
<P>
   On March 7, the ``Super Tuesday'' of the 2000 primary season,
McCain hopes to do well in the five New England states holding a
primary, as well as Maryland and Minnesota. He is also hoping to
win in the Republican-only primary in New York, with longer-shot
chances in Ohio and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   But some of McCain's top aides have said that he must also win
California to become the nominee, and he faces an especially tough
fight there. Under California's unusual rules, anyone can vote in
the state's primary, but only the ballots of Republicans count
toward the winner-take-all selection of 162 delegates. As a result,
McCain could win the most votes in California but _ if he loses the
Republican vote _ not get a single delegate. That would be a harsh
blow because the March 14 primaries are tilted in Bush's favor,
including votes in his home state of Texas and Florida, where his
brother Jeb is governor.

 &HT;    Bauer asks McCain to ease GOP right
 &HT;    By Jim Bebbington

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Former presidential candidate Gary Bauer,
stumping for Arizona Sen. John McCain in Dayton on Tuesday, said
McCain needs to reassure religious right voters that his attacks on
Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell Monday do not distance him from the
party's conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the confusion about (Monday's) speech he needs to
very directly, and very openly, reach out to pro-family and
pro-life voters,'' Bauer said at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in downtown
Dayton. ``Otherwise, they will be confused about where he really
stands.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed McCain,
he said, not because of issues, but because McCain has a better
chance to beat Vice President Al Gore in November's general
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faced with two candidates I think are virtually alike on most
of the social issues, I decided to go with the candidate I thought
could most likely win in November and end what has been a very
difficult and, in some cases, embarassing eight years for the
United States,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Delivering a speech in Virginia on Monday, McCain called Moral
Majority founder Jerry Falwell and Christian Coalition founder Pat
Robertson ``agents of intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Sue Kyte, McCain's Ohio coordinator, said the speech was not an
attack on religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``(His point was) the tent of the Republican Party should be as
large as the country,'' Kyte said. ``What he advocated very clearly
was inclusion, and not exclusionary politics. He is opposed to
those who advocate exclusionary politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said McCain needs to re-emphasize his conservative record
and reassure religious right voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The senator right now has a very personal argument going on
with two individuals,'' Bauer said. ``I believe his comparison
yesterday of those individuals with Louis Farrakhan and Rev. (Al)
Sharpton was inappropriate. I would not have made such a
comparison.''

JACOBS WINS, BUT IS WELL OFF 4-MINUTE GOAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By LENA WILLIAMS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The crowd was cheering for her; the track was fast,
and the race itself was a special event. Everything was designed to
help Regina Jacobs do what no other woman had done indoors: run
1,500 meters in under four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old Jacobs tried to come through for the crowd of
more than 3,000 at the Armory Track and Field Center Tuesday night.
But despite winning easily, she could not pull off the feat or even
set an American record. She won the race in a time of 4:07.06, more
than 7 seconds off the record. The current world indoor record is 4
minutes 0.2 seconds, set 10 years ago by Doina Melinte of Romania.
The American record is 4:00.8 set by Mary Slaney at the 1980
Millrose Games.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing behind Jacobs, the top-rated female miler in the
United States and third in the world, was Christine Junkerman,
running for the Adidas Club, in 4:22.36 and Jodie D'Ariano, with
Asix, in 4:25.55.
</P>
<P>
   Had she broken the record, Jacobs would have received a $20,000
prize offered by the New York Road Runners Club, which sponsored
the race during during the Eastern States High School Indoor
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Until the final lap, it looked like money in the bank. Jacobs,
running on the fast Mondo track and paced smartly for the first
1,000 meters by Michelle Ave, entered the bell lap in a time of
3:32, faster than the record pace. She was maintaining a steady
stride.
</P>
<P>
   But during that final lap, while Jacobs was far ahead of the
other competitors, her pace slowed despite the cheering from an
enthusiastic crowd, many with her name on placards or buttons.
Jacobs, a runner known for her endurance, could not endure.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't always get what you want,'' she said after the race.
``That happened. We did not accomplish the record today. Save that
for another day, but we did inspire a big group of kids.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past year, Jacobs has been on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   She won a silver medal in the 1,500 meters at the world track
and field championships in Seville last August and achieved a
1500-5000 double in the national outdoor championships. This past
month, she won the Millrose Games mile by 14 seconds and set an
American record of 2:35.29 in the women's 1,000 meters at the New
Balance Invitational in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Of the reigning elite field of American middle-distance runners,
Jacobs is considered the one most capable of running a
sub-four-minute 1,500. She was enough of an odds-on favorite that
three insurance companies refused to back the initial $10,000 prize
offered by the New York Road Runners Club. On Monday, Lloyd's of
London agreed to back the $20,000 award _ which the club was also
seeking _ for a $3,000 fee.
</P>
<P>
   Many had thought her chances of breaking the record were
enhanced by several factors. She was running on a fast track at one
of her favorite arenas, the Armory Track and Field Center in Upper
Manhattan where she had run a 4:20.79 mile on Jan. 8.
</P>
<P>
   She also had help from a respected pace-setter in Ave, a leading
half-miler.
</P>
<P>
   And in her own words, Jacobs entered Tuesday night's race in
``possibly the best mental and physical shape'' in her career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in great shape,'' said Jacobs, who arrived in New York
from her home in Oakland, Calif., last Thursday with her husband,
Tom Craig, who also serves as her coach. ``In terms of preparation,
in terms of diet, I feel like a prizefighter. I'm ready. How many
times in your career do you get in this kind of shape? I'm in it
now and there's no reason I can't break this record.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs reportedly has not decided whether she will run the mile
at national indoor championships in Atlanta this weekend, or
whether she will try to break Melinte's record of 4:17.14, set the
same time she established the 1,500 mark.

BRADLEY MIFFED BY LACK OF ATTENTION GIVEN HIS EFFORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN AND BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Maybe he should have robbed a bank, after all.
</P>
<P>
   After joking about committing a felony to grab the attention of
voters and the media, Bill Bradley came to Washington state last
week to rev up his flagging campaign with a victory and gain the
momentum he says he needs heading into the 16 primaries and
caucuses on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he decamped after five days for California,
acknowledging that his strategy hadn't panned out even though he
believed its voters would be ``in synch'' with his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his fading prospects and downward spiral in the polls
from California to New York and New England, Bradley vowed Tuesday
to wage a final costly blitz over the next week before deciding if
he is fighting a lost cause.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Bradley's prospects grew dimmer with the loss he expects
in Washington, he was privately preparing for a debate with Vice
President Al Gore in Los Angeles Wednesday and was buying a
five-minute network television spot for a prime-time appeal to the
nation Thursday night on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   ``This race has just begun,'' Bradley said in a television
interview in San Francisco. ``March 7 will be the big, decisive
day, and so March 7 is takeoff time for this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   But political analysts said the intensity of the Republican
battle will continue to deprive Bradley of the spotlight, and the
votes, for that to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad news is obvious . . . that everyone is writing him
off,'' said Rhodes Cook, a specialist on the nominating process and
author of ``Race for the Presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook said Bradley's situation has become so dire that he faces
the possibility of losing every state that is up for grabs on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That certainly seems to be the case in California, the prize
among all states with 7.8 percent of the total number of delegates
necessary to win the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not even a race going on right now,'' said Paul
Maslin, a Democratic pollster in California, referring to polls
that show Bradley's support continuing to drop.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is particularly vexing for the former New Jersey
senator considering that only 22 delegates have been selected in
two contests, Iowa and New Hampshire. Gore has 13 delegates to
Bradley's nine, with over 2,000 needed to win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley has suffered an extreme reversal of fortune since
the fall, when he enjoyed sky-high poll numbers in New Hampshire,
New York and Massachusetts, and when he graced the covers of the
newsmagazines.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, he has angered his top campaign supporters in
the largest states with contests Tuesday by devoting precious days
to Washington's primary. By contrast, Gore has shifted to a general
election strategy, hopscotching the country, shrugging off Bradley
as a mere nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come here . . . to ask you to unite this Democratic Party
and let's get on with the task of winning the election,'' Gore said
in Colorado on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   By barnstorming across Washington, Bradley neglected California,
New York, Missouri and New England, where he needs strong showings
to justify continuing his campaign. Bradley and his aides defended
the strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it was a good five days,'' said Bradley's spokesman,
Eric Hauser. ``We think we made a very strong impression. We think
we shook up the race some, and we're glad we did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's top aides have also stressed publicly and privately
that he would not quit the campaign before Tuesday, even if a
shutout is foreseen.
</P>
<P>
   In his five-minute commercial spot Bradley will speak
``personally to voters about his vision for the country and the
basis of his candidacy and why he would be a better president,''
Hauser said.
</P>
<P>
   Hauser would not disclose the cost of the ad, which will follow
the show ``Diagnosis Murder'' at 10:54 p.m. and compete with the
closing scenes of a rerun of ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also began running a commercial in Massachusetts
Wednesday that portrays him as the only candidate who has always
supported gun control and abortion rights. The ad is meant to draw
a distinction with Gore, who as a member of the House and Senate
cast some votes against tougher gun laws and federal funding of
abortion for poor women.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has also produced an ad featuring former New York
mayor Ed Koch and filmmaker Spike Lee, but has yet to schedule it
for the airwaves in New York. Koch has been harshly critical of
Bradley's ``Washington strategy,'' which may have hurt Bradley's
campaign in New York. Bradley had once been considered a sure
winner in New York because of his 10-year career with the New York
Knicks and his 18 years as a senator from neighboring New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Polls now show him trailing Gore by a wide margin in the Empire
State.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bradley continued to insist that the Washington foray had
not hurt him. Rather, he attributed his dismal poll numbers to the
difficulty of trying to compete in a ``national primary,''
especially while McCain has commanded so much media attention.
</P>
<P>
   But interest in McCain is unlikely to dissipate during the next
week, when Bradley needs attention the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters tend to go where the action is,'' said Sherry Bebitch
Jeffe, a senior associate at the School of Politics and Economics
at Claremont Graduate School in California. ``And if they don't
prceive any action on the Democratic side, they're most likely to
look at the Republican side.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffe said that means that McCain is likely to continue gaining
support from the independent-minded voters Bradley covets. So the
final question for Bradley is when to pull the plug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, this has gotten to be so deeply personal, that he
might not want to let go,'' Jeffe said. ``The only person who can
answer that question is Bill Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a confident vice president raised money at a luncheon
in Los Angeles Tuesday to help with the final push.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was clearly sure of himself. Asked by reporters what he
expected out of the Washington state results, the vice president
said ``Oh, I'm not making any assumptions.''
</P>
<P>
   He then backed away, saying, ``I'm not taking a single vote for
granted,'' holding his arms out to the side and literally dancing
away.
</P>
<P>

FORMER REGENTS WANT GRADUATION PLAN DELAYED
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As members of the state Board of Regents in the
1990s, Norma Gluck, Floyd Linton and Louise Matteoni helped develop
the policies that would eventually require all students to pass the
state's rigorous Regents exams to earn a high school diploma, a
change that is taking effect over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   But now the three former regents say they feel betrayed and have
stepped out of retirement to call for an about-face. They are
asking the Board of Regents to postpone the plan for two years and
appoint an independent panel to evaluate it. The problem, they say,
is that students have different styles of learning and should not
all be required to meet a single, uniform set of standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The premise of this policy is that everybody learns the same
way and everybody has the same aspirations in life,'' said
Matteoni, a retired professor of education at Brooklyn College who
left the Board of Regents in 1998. ``It's an elitist standard that
rules out any number of students.''
</P>
<P>
   The former regents have laid out their concerns about the new
graduation requirements in a position paper they are about to send
to the board and several members of the Legislature. They initially
expressed their concerns in a letter to the Regents last spring,
but they said that they never received a response.
</P>
<P>
   When told of their proposal, Steven Sanders, a Manhattan
Democrat who is chairman of the State Assembly Education Committee,
said that it deserved serious consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people put in a lot of time on the Board of Regents,''
Sanders said. ``Their views should not automatically be
dismissed.''
</P>
<P>
   Matteoni, a Manhattan resident, was a regent for 21 years.
Gluck, a psychiatric social worker from Manhattan, spent 14 years
on the board, and Linton, a businessman from Long Island, served
for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The paper comes at a time when politicians and academics around
the nation are having second thoughts about high-stakes testing and
rigorous, uniform academic standards. With many students failing to
make the grade and their parents lashing out against the tough
policies, a number of states are scaling back their graduation
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   But New York, despite some protest from parents, educators and
the Legislature, has pushed ahead. Starting this year, students
will have to pass a more rigorous English Regents exam to earn a
high school diploma. By 2004, they will have to pass similar exams
in four other subjects: math, American history and government,
global studies, and science.
</P>
<P>
   Carl T. Hayden, the chancellor of the Board of Regents, and
Richard P. Mills, the state education commissioner, said that they
would not consider postponing the policy because it was already
proving a success. Mills said that easing the graduation
requirements even temporarily would be ``absurd'' and ``unjust,''
because it would send a signal that not every student should be
held to high expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a bogus argument to suggest that some students can't
achieve at the levels we have set,'' Mills said. ``And it is an
absurd proposal to stop at the very moment when teachers, school
administrators and, above all, children, are demonstrating
success.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayden said he was surprised at the former regents' opposition
to the new graduation policy, because Gluck and Matteoni
participated in the discussions leading up to its adoption and
voted for the requirements in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But the women said that when they voted to require all students
to take the Regents exams, they did not realize that test scores
would be the only factor determining whether students got diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thinking at that point was that everyone would take the
exams, but you could get a diploma through other channels,'' Gluck
said. ``There was never the sense that everyone would be expected
to reach the exact same goals in the exact same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the old system, students had two options: getting a local
diploma by passing a set of basic competency tests, or getting a
more prestigious Regents diploma by passing the more difficult
Regents exams. When the Board of Regents adopted the new policy in
1996, less than 40 percent of students statewide _ and less than 25
percent of New York City students _ were graduating with Regents
diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The former Regents said they were especially concerned about
special education students, immigrant students who had not mastered
English, and students who wanted to pursue vocational careers that
did not necessarily require a college education. But Hayden said
that the new policy made exceptions for such students. Special
education students who fail the Regents exams will be allowed to
take the basic competency tests until 2004, and the Regents are
still discussing whether to continue that policy beyond then.
</P>
<P>
   Students who are not proficient in English can take all the
exams except the English exam in their native language _ a
provision that Gluck said fell short because those students might
have a hard time preparing for the exams in classrooms where only
English was spoken.

<P>
   Black students in public schools across the country are far more
likely than whites to be suspended or expelled, and far less likely
to be in gifted or advanced placement classes, according to a study
of 12 large public school districts released Tuesday by the Applied
Research Center, a left-leaning nonprofit public policy group in
Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which comes at a time of heightened attention to
racial differences in education, found inequalities in the
districts studied: Austin, Texas, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Durham,
N.C., Los Angeles, Miami, Columbia, S.C., San Francisco, Missoula,
Mont., and Providence, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents often feel that these are individual issues,'' said
Libero Della Piana, a senior researcher at the center and a
co-author of the report, ``that it's just their kid having a
problem, that it's about this teacher or that administrator, but
when you look at the data, you see it's a systemic issue along race
lines.''
</P>
<P>
   In every district studied except Missoula, Mont., where the data
were unavailable, black students were suspended or expelled at a
higher rate than their white peers. In Los Angeles, for example,
black students made up 14 percent of the student body, but 30
percent of those suspended or expelled. The study did not offer
details about whether students at the same school received similar
punishments for similar acts.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the racial skew in expulsion rates became a national
issue after six black students in Decatur, Ill., were expelled
following a brawl in the bleachers at a high school football game,
and the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson's Rainbow/Operation PUSH Coalition
filed a civil-rights lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The case was dismissed and the expulsions upheld, but the
testimony showed that blacks accounted for more than 80 percent of
the district's expulsions over the last four years, even though
they make up less than half of the student body.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of racial skew is common in several aspects of
education, the study found. In all nine districts that provided
statistics on academic placement by race, the study found, white
students were disproportionately represented in advanced placement
and gifted programs, and minority students underrepresented.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, the study found that blacks and Latinos make
up 42 percent of the student body, but only 14 percent of those in
advanced placement and gifted programs. And in Durham, N.C., where
blacks and Latinos make up 62 percent of the students, they
represent only 27 percent of the students in academically advanced
classes.
</P>
<P>
   While few of the districts studied had large Asian-American
populations, the Asian-American students in most districts were
overrepresented in advanced classes and underrepresented among
those who were disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   The study asserts that the disparities amount to ``a deep
pattern of institutional racism.'' But many education experts took
issue with that conclusion. While the inequalities described in the
study are distressing, they say, those differences, like the
well-documented racial gap on test scores, do not necessarily add
up to institutional racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we have a lot of history and evidence that
schools tend to reproduce the economic and social disparities of
the larger society,'' said Robert B. Schwartz, president of
Achieve, a school reform group made up of governors and corporate
executives. ``We look to schooling to be this great equalizing
engine, but history hasn't been terrific on that score. Can one
deny that racism persists? Of course not. But I think it's more
complicated than racism alone. Obviously, class plays into this,
and other factors.''
</P>
<P>
   The study examined 10 indicators, including the dropout rate,
graduation rate, suspensions and expulsion, advanced and gifted
classes, college admissions and the racial demographics of the
teachers compared with those of the students.
</P>
<P>
   In all the districts, the percentage of white teachers was
higher than the percentage of white students, often by a huge
margin. In Denver, more than three-quarters of the teachers, but
less than one-quarter of the students, were white. And in Los
Angeles and Chicago, about half the teachers, but only about one in
10 students, were white.
</P>
<P>
   While federal regulations require the reporting of some data,
including the racial makeup of the student body, there is no
nationwide mandate to keep other statistics, like expulsions and
suspensions, or the number of students admitted to a college, by
race. And of the 12 districts included in the study, 9 either did
not keep, or would not disclose, all the data requested.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 3 of the 12 districts did not report data on the
racial makeup of their advanced placement and gifted classes.
</P>
<P>
   But more data by race may be forthcoming. Partly because of the
experience in Texas, where school results have improved since
achievement was tracked by race, many legislators, both Democrats
and Republicans, are supporting efforts to tally education
statistics by race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas has been an important model for this,'' said Gary
Orfield, a professor of education at Harvard. ``Requiring more data
by race doesn't produce a solution, but it means the problems can't
be covered up.''

SCIOSCIA LIKES TEAM'S FIRST OUTING
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ The Angels tasted live action for the first time
this spring, playing an intrasquad game Tuesday, the Temps against
the Madmen.
</P>
<P>
   The Temps, managed by Garry Templeton, were made up of what
could be the Angels' opening-day lineup: Darin Erstad, DH; Jim
Edmonds, CF; Mo Vaughn, 1B; Tim Salmon, RF; Garret Anderson, LF;
Troy Glaus, 3B; Scott Spiezio, 2B; Matt Walbeck, C, and Gary
DiSarcina, SS. The only starting spots in question are at second
base and catcher.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Ortiz started for the Temps and threw one perfect inning,
and Ken Hill started for the Madmen, also throwing a perfect
inning, including a strikeout of Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exciting,'' manager Mike Scioscia said of the game, won
3-2 by the Temps. ``There were a lot of great signs. There was good
situational hitting, guys got bunts down and we turned some double
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   There was one minor mishap. On a single to right field by
Vaughn, Jim Edmonds was waved around third by third-base coach Ron
Roenicke but Edmonds stopped. He scored anyway when the right
fielder booted the ball, but Roenicke appeared baffled by Edmonds'
actions. As Edmonds entered the dugout, Scioscia asked Edmonds what
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked back and thought the ball got knocked down (by an
infielder),'' Scioscia said. ``That's what intrasquad games are for
_ to work out some kinks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels play Arizona State tonight at 7.
</P>
<P>
   __ New approach: There were some players who relied heavily on
former hitting coach Rod Carew. But even though Carew brought
instant respect based on his seven batting titles and Hall of Fame
status, Salmon said the hitters might be able to learn from other
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can always gain from new knowledge,'' Salmon said. ``What
Rod did will be missed, but this is new insight with (hitting
coach) Mickey (Hatcher) and Mike (Scioscia) coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Friday's starter: Left-handed pitcher Jarrod Washburn will
start for the Angels when they begin Cactus League play Friday
against the Mariners.

VETERANS PICK SPARKY ANDERSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. _ The call telling Sparky Anderson he'd
made the Hall of Fame was supposed to come between 10:30 and 11
Tuesday morning. The phone didn't ring in his Thousand Oaks home
until shortly after 11.
</P>
<P>
   For Anderson, awakened by anticipation before 6 a.m., there had
been time to take a brisk walk, eat a heart-healthy breakfast, zip
to the hardware store to buy birdseed _ and get a case of nerves.
</P>
<P>
   What if he hadn't made it after all?
</P>
<P>
   He was in the backyard, feeding the birds, when Joe Brown of the
Hall of Fame's Veterans Committee called.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe,'' Anderson said to the former Pittsburgh Pirates
executive, ``did we or didn't we?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We did,'' Brown replied.
</P>
<P>
   With that, Anderson, a World Series-winning manager with the
Cincinnati Reds and Detroit Tigers, learned he'll be inducted July
23 into the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. Also to be honored
are 19th-century infielder Bid McPhee and Negro Leagues outfielder
Turkey Stearnes, each admitted Tuesday by the Veterans Committee,
and Tony Perez and Carlton Fisk, each voted in by baseball writers
in January.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-member Veterans Committee, composed of former players,
executives and writers, said no to the Hall of Fame bids of Bill
Mazeroski (who fell one vote short of the 11 needed), Gil Hodges,
Dom DiMaggio, Mel Harder and Tony Oliva.
</P>
<P>
   A friend who was in the house said Anderson, 66, choked up when
he heard committee members Ted Williams, Yogi Berra and Hank Aaron
applauding in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson quickly phoned his three children, two sisters and
brother with the news. He fielded a congratulatory call from
baseball commissioner Bud Selig. Then it was time to reflect.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could you go from Bridgewater, S.D., with a population of
632 _ there were 624 after we left _ to what happened today?''
Anderson, ever the folk philosopher, said in a casual press
conference at Sunset Hills Country Club, near his Thousand Oaks
home of 33 years. ``I believe no human being can be better than any
other human being, but some human beings are more fortunate. I'm
more fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``July 23 will not be my day. July 23 will be the day for my
mother and father and everybody else who put me on that podium.''
</P>
<P>
   Paying tribute to former Reds general manager Bob Howsam,
Anderson said he has chosen to be portrayed in a Cincinnati cap on
his Hall of Fame plaque. It was Howsam who hired a 35-year-old
former minor-league infielder with no managing experience above
Class AA to run the Reds in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson likes to say that without that break, he might have
spent his life in the bushes. He went on to manage 26 years in the
majors, winning 2,194 games (third on the all-time list behind
Connie Mack and John McGraw), winning World Series with teams from
both leagues (the only man to do so) and leading both the Reds and
Tigers in managing victories (also a first).
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's Reds made it to the World Series in his first year
and won it in 1975 and 1976. Of course, some believed anybody could
win with Perez, Johnny Bench, Joe Morgan and Pete Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Then Anderson won another World Series with the
less-star-studded Tigers in 1984. He must have been doing something
right. He said all he did was ``get players and stay out of their
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he has never worn his World Series rings but will
wear his Hall of Fame ring ``until the day I die.'' Retired since
1995, he is being honored in his first year of eligibility. He'll
be the 16th manager in Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a young player starting out in baseball, you'll do
everything in your power to make the Hall of Fame,'' Anderson said.
``I told Tommy Lasorda when he made it (in 1997), that's for
eternity. The world will have to end for the Hall of Fame to go
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that when a Hall of Famer was in my office, I always
treated him with reverence.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson seemed pleased with what Brown told him on the phone:
``You belong.''

PLAYING `D' HELPS HEINLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Just when his teammates needed him most, Brian
Heinle turned to a part of his game for which he's not well known.
</P>
<P>
   Heinle, Cal State Northridge's center and the team's leading
scorer, gave an impact performance on defense in the last 10
minutes of the Matadors' 79-78 victory over Portland State last
weekend. The 6-foot-10 junior had two steals and a block, inspiring
CSUN to rally from 17 points down with 7 minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian Heinle played the best defensive game of his career here
and his life,'' CSUN coach Bobby Braswell said. ``He was blocking
shots, denying ball reversals, getting steals. He was just
phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinle scored a team-high 19 points and he made 8 of 14 shots.
But he elevated his play offensively only after he became a force
on the other end.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can rebound and defend, everything else will come,''
Heinle said. ``That's where I was trying to put all my energy, into
the defensive end.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN (16-9, 8-6) has two games left in the regular season,
starting with tonight's crucial game against Weber State (17-8,
9-5) at Matador Gym. Northridge is fifth in the Big Sky Conference,
one game behind the fourth-place Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors needed a big game from Heinle against Portland
State, especially after averaging only 8.5 points and shooting 28
percent (11 of 39) in a recent four-game stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get basketball out my head,'' Heinle said. ``I go
home, I'm in class, whatever, I'm thinking about hoops. I wanted to
come out (against PSU) and be successful. I felt I'd been letting
my teammates down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to come out and show them that I wanted to win.''
</P>
<P>
   __ No mystery: Lakers executive Jerry West, who watched most of
CSUN's game against Portland State, is expected to be courtside
again tonight, presumably to watch Weber State senior Harold
Arceneaux, who leads the Big Sky in scoring at 22.7 points per
game.
</P>
<P>
   Heinle joked with reporters after Saturday's game when West's
name was mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was here?'' Heinle asked, pretending to be surprised. A
second later, he smiled and said: ``I knew he was here. Everybody
knew he was here.''

EDITORIAL: A FAIR VERDICT ON STRAWBERRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, March 1:
</P>
<P>
   There is something terribly sad about Darryl Strawberry. He is
by all accounts a personable man with a nimble sense of humor. He
is also, even now, a formidable baseball player, blessed with
coordination, power and one of the smoothest swings in the game. He
came up with the New York Mets in 1983 and drew comparisons to the
young Ted Williams. He hit 280 home runs before he was 30, but has
hit only 55 since then _ partly because he has had a bad back, as
well as colon cancer in 1998, but partly because of his drinking
and drug habits.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, a little over five weeks after he tested positive for
cocaine, Major League Baseball gave him his third drug-related
suspension since 1995, this time for a full year. Considering his
age, 38 on March 12, we may have seen the last of Strawberry in a
major league uniform.
</P>
<P>
   The one-year ban is fair and it may eventually help Strawberry,
even save him, in much the same way that a similar suspension
helped Dwight Gooden, a teammate of Strawberry's on the 1986 World
Champion Mets. There are those who argue that Strawberry's ban is
too severe, that another temporary suspension would have been
sufficient, that he cannot live without baseball. But baseball has
been down this road with Strawberry before. All sorts of people,
notably the Yankees' George Steinbrenner, have given him second and
third chances.
</P>
<P>
   These arguments also misread the nature of addiction and the
best way to deal with it. Strawberry is in rather serious denial
about lots of things, drugs and booze included. He is deeply in
debt to the IRS and is still planning to build an expensive new
house in Florida. He has four children, with a fifth on the way.
But these obligations have not dissuaded him from taking drugs any
more than playing baseball has. The truth is that baseball has been
an enabler in Strawberry's addiction, paying him a handsome salary
and keeping him in the limelight but also _ and this is the key
point _ shielding him from the need to confront the truth of his
addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Bud Selig, the commissioner of baseball, has not given Darryl
Strawberry a bum deal. He may actually have given him a fair shot
at life.

AUBREY ROBINSON JR., JUDGE IN POLLARD SPY CASE, DIES AT 77
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aubrey E. Robinson Jr., chief judge of the U.S.District Court
for the District of Columbia from 1982 to 1992, died Sunday at his
home in Washington. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   In his most notable ruling, Robinson handed down the severest
sentence possible, life in prison, to Jonathan Jay Pollard for
spying on Israel's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence for Pollard in 1987, which he is serving at the
Federal Correctional Institution in Butner, N.C., has proven
enduringly controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1998, the Clinton administration has been reviewing a
request from Israel that Pollard be released. Supporters of Pollard
argue that a deal under which he was to have received a lesser
sentence was reneged on.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson pronounced his sentence on Pollard, then a 32-year-old
former civilian intelligence analyst for the Navy who had pleaded
guilty to spying for Israel, in a highly emotional session.
</P>
<P>
   While the judge disclosed his sentence, the defendant's wife,
Anne Henderson Pollard, then 26, fell to the floor screaming, ``No!
No!'' Soon afterward, the judge sentenced her to two concurrent
five-year terms for her role in the espionage conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard had been privy to sensitive papers as a member of the
staff of the Navy's Anti-Terrorist Alert Center in Suitland, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department had not called for a life sentence for
him but for ``substantial'' imprisonment. That imprecise request
was an ingredient of a plea agreement under which the Pollards
pleaded guilty and committed themselves to cooperate with
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier in the proceedings Robinson took issue with the
defense's contentions that Jonathan Pollard's criminal activity in
providing Israel with classified information had not hurt the
United States because the two countries were close allies.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard's lawyer, Richard A. Hibey, told Robinson, ``The damage
here is not serious damage to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge replied, ``I fail to see how you can make that
claim,'' and he cited a classified affidavit from Secretary of
Defense Caspar W. Weinberger that gave the main points of the
damage done.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was also known for his award of ``punitive damages'' to
the surviving relatives of passengers who died in the crash of
Korean Air Lines Flight 007, shot down in Soviet airspace in 1983.
But his decision was reversed by a higher court on the ground that
it was not justified under existing law.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Madison, N.J., Aubrey Eugene Robinson, Jr. received
a bachelor's degree and his law degree from Cornell University.
After practicing law in Washington and serving briefly on a
juvenile court there, he was appointed an associate judge of the
district court in 1966 by President Lyndon B. Johnson, who later
named him chief judge.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson became a senior judge when he turned 70, in 1992, and
remained on the bench until his death.
</P>
<P>
   He married Sara Payne in 1946; she died in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   His survivors include his wife, the former Doris A. Washington,
whom he married in 1973; two daughters, Paula Elaine Collins and
Sheryl Robinson, both of San Francisco; a stepdaughter, Jacqueline
Washington of Rockville, Md.; a sister and a brother and two
granddaughters.

HAROLD MULVEY, 86, JUDGE AT TENSE BLACK PANTHER TRIALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)   (bl)  
 By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harold M. Mulvey, the Connecticut Superior Court judge who
presided calmly over the emotionally charged murder trials of
several Black Panthers in the early 1970s, died Feb. 27 at a
nursing home in Hamden, Conn. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   In his most famous ruling, Mulvey dismissed murder and
kidnapping charges against Bobby G. Seale, the Black Panther
national chairman, and Ericka Huggins, the party's Connecticut
leader, after the jury deadlocked in May 1971.
</P>
<P>
   It had taken four months to select the jury, and the judge
stunned courtroom spectators who had been expecting him to order a
retrial when he said, ``I find it impossible to believe that an
unbiased jury could be selected without superhuman efforts _
efforts which this court, the state and these defendants should not
be called upon either to make or to endure.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing his decision, the judge noted that the defendants
had already spent two years in jail since being arrested in
connection with the torture and killing of Alex Rackley, a member
of the New York chapter of the Black Panthers found burned and
fatally shot in Connecticut in May 1969. Other members had
suspected him of being a police informer.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against numerous Black Panthers in the case drew
widespread publicity, and protests shut down Yale University and
attracted 15,000 people to a rally on the New Haven green.
</P>
<P>
   The case prompted the president of Yale, Kingman Brewster Jr.,
to say he was ``skeptical of the ability of black revolutionaries
to achieve a fair trial anywhere in the United States.'' Vice
President Spiro T. Agnew suggested that Brewster be removed from
his post for the remark.
</P>
<P>
   Mulvey defused much of the tension in the courtroom during the
trials, rarely showing emotion and being patient with periodic
outbursts. He maintained his calm throughout, though he did scowl
periodically, such as when Seale remarked from the stand that
political assassination was a tactic of the CIA and not the Black
Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial of Lonnie McLucas, a Black Panther member
convicted of conspiracy in the same killing, Mulvey did not
intervene when the defendant and the gallery exchanged greetings of
``All power to the people'' each time McLucas entered and left the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have tolerated a certain amount of nonsense in this court,''
Mulvey said after that trial.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the Panthers accused him of being racially biased,
quoting remarks he made during a confidential study of the
judiciary undertaken by a sociologist from Washington University in
St. Louis. Some of the remarks were leaked to alternative
newspapers, which quoted Mulvey as saying that racial integration
had damaged New Haven's schools and driven whites to move to the
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   In a public speech on the subject of race, however, he said:
``It was never a problem when we were children. Our first lesson at
the knee of our mother, or at kindergarten with the sister, was
that all men are created equal. Each has a body and soul.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same speech, he said black leaders should avoid actions
that ``create an anti-social image'' and provide ``fodder for the
wagging tongues of bigots.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulvey was born in New Haven on Dec. 5, 1914, one of five
children of parents who had emigrated from Ireland. He received an
undergraduate degree from Fordham University and earned his law
degree there in 1941 before joining the Coast Guard during World
War II for four years, commanding a landing craft at Iwo Jima and
Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   After briefly practicing law in New York, he opened a law office
in New Haven and eventually become the city's corporation counsel
under Mayor Richard C. Lee. Gov. John Dempsey appointed him state
attorney general in 1963, and he won election to the office in 1967
but resigned a year later to accept appointment as a Superior Court
judge.
</P>
<P>
   Mulvey served on the bench until he reached the mandatory
retirement age of 70 in 1984, after which he became a state trial
referee. He claimed that his favorite pastime was gardening,
although he admitted to neglecting his flowers during difficult
trials.
</P>
<P>
   Mulvey was married to the late Genevieve Carrol Mulvey, and is
survived by a daughter, Ann Mulvey, of Blaine, Wash., and two
grandchildren.

RATTNER LEAVING LAZARD FRERES TO START NEW FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Steven Rattner, the deputy chairman of the investment
bank Lazard Freres &AMP; Co., is leaving to start a New York investment
firm with three other Lazard bankers.
</P>
<P>
   Rattner, who turned over daily management of Lazard's New York
operations to William Loomis last summer, will be a partner in
Quadrangle Group, which plans to invest privately in media and
telecommunications companies. His move is the latest signal that
private-equity investing, which offers the chance to share in the
gains of fast-growing businesses, has supplanted investment banking
as the most attractive job in finance.
</P>
<P>
   People who know Rattner, a prominent fund-raiser for the
Democratic Party who is close to Vice President Al Gore, have
speculated he would go to Washington, possibly as a cabinet member,
if Gore becomes president. But this move should put an end to that
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Rattner's new firm hopes to raise as much as $1 billion, a
process that will take weeks or months, and then find places to
invest it, which should take considerably longer. The fledgling
firm has already lined up some high-profile advisers and investors,
including Barry Diller, chairman of USA Networks, and Brian L.
Roberts, president of Comcast.
</P>
<P>
   While Rattner's departure was expected, Lazard's loss of three
other partners is a blow to a firm that had already lost several of
its most senior partners. Joining Rattner are David A. Tanner,
co-head of Lazard's private equity business, and two of the firm's
media and communications bankers, Peter R. Ezersky and Joshua L.
Steiner.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Quadrangle's partners said they planned to
invest in cable, telephone and media companies in all stages of
development, not just start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of Lazard, declined to comment. In an internal memo
from Loomis, the firm wished the departing partners well.
</P>
<P>
   Lazard, which has about 140 partners worldwide, has been
reorganizing since the departure of Felix G. Rohatyn, who once ran
the firm's New York operation and is now the U.S. ambassador to
France. Late last year, Lazard sought to shore up its senior ranks
by hiring Vernon E. Jordan Jr., the Washington power broker.
</P>
<P>
   But that move created dissension as partners and other employees
heard details of the contract Jordan negotiated with Lazard's
chairman, Michel A. David-Weill. People inside the firm said
Jordan, who had never been an investment banker, was guaranteed at
least $5 million a year for five years.

JOHN C. LUNGREN, 83, NIXON'S DOCTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, Calif.)   (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. John C. Lungren, who was President Richard M. Nixon's
longtime personal physician, died Feb. 28 at Long Beach Memorial
Hospital Medical Center in California, where he guided Nixon's care
during a near-fatal illness in 1974. Lungren was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren was a specialist in internal medicine and cardiology and
a former chief of staff at Long Beach Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   An early supporter of Nixon, he was the family's physician from
1952 and cared for Pat Nixon when she had a stroke in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren was thrust into the national spotlight in 1974 when,
shortly after Nixon resigned the presidency, Nixon nearly died from
complications of phlebitis, an inflammation of veins in his leg.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at news conferences to give updates on Nixon's
condition, Lungren was the man in the middle in a dispute over
Nixon's ability to testify at the Watergate cover-up trial of his
former aides, including H.R. Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, and John
Mitchell, the former attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, many speculated that the former president was
trying to avoid testifying. After Lungren said Nixon could not
travel to Washington for up to three months because of phlebitis,
Judge John J. Sirica, who presided over the trial, sent a panel of
three doctors to determine his fitness to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren said he understood the need but expressed displeasure
that all three doctors were from Eastern medical centers and none
from the West. The panel agreed that Nixon was not fit to travel
for several weeks, and Judge Sirica said he could not wait.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon died in 1994, a year after his wife's death.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's brush with death came about two months after his
resignation. He had developed phlebitis many years earlier and in a
common way _ after a long flight. The 1974 flareup occurred during
the waning weeks of his presidency. When the phlebitis worsened
after Nixon's return to California as a private citizen, Lungren
said he twice advised Nixon to enter a hospital for treatment. But
Nixon delayed, saying, ``If I go into the hospital, I'll never come
out alive.''
</P>
<P>
   His fear nearly came to be.
</P>
<P>
   In September, 45 days after resigning, Nixon relented and
entered the hospital. A few days later, a piece of a clot that
formed in the inflamed vein in his left leg broke off and traveled
in the bloodstream to damage his right lung. After a two-week stay,
Nixon went home.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later Nixon was back in the hospital. This time he
nearly died when he went into shock from bleeding as a complication
of an operation to prevent further damage from blood clots.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren kept Nixon's medical records in a safe that was doubly
locked in his office a few steps from the hospital. In September
1972, during the height of the presidential campaign, the safe was
rifled twice and Nixon's records were found on the office floor,
with no evidence that any were missing. The FBI concluded that
someone had photocopied the records, but the case was never solved,
Lungren's son John C. Jr. said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Lungren also said Nixon had given full legal
permission ``and release from all medical ethical constraints'' to
his father to write about his medical care and their friendship.
Dr. Lungren used them to prepare a manuscript now being considered
for publication, his son said.
</P>
<P>
   John Charles Lungren was born in Sioux City, Iowa, and went to
school in Long Beach; his family moved there because his ailing
father needed to live in a warm climate. After his father's death,
Lungren returned to Sioux City where he finished high school. He
graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1938. He later
served as president of its alumni association and was a member of
its board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren received his medical degree from the University of
Pennsylvania in 1942 and took further training at Los Angeles
County Hospital. He then served in the Army in World War II and was
an infantry battalion surgeon in the Normandy invasion in 1944. He
was awarded four battle stars and a Purple Heart.
</P>
<P>
   Finding no positions available in Eastern hospitals after the
war, Lungren joined Long Beach Memorial Medical Center in 1946 and
stayed until he retired in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren was an only child. His friends and family said he was
shy and guarded his privacy. Early in his career, he had a habit of
taking sandwiches from home and eating them alone in his office. He
reluctantly changed after his mother and wife told him he had to
eat with colleagues in the hospital. But he was outspoken and
forceful when confronting anything he thought was unethical or
unjust, his son John said.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren met Nixon through his wife, the former Lorain Youngberg
of Chicago and a former Powers model. A friend of hers, Helene
Drown, taught school with Pat Nixon, and Drown's husband, Jack, a
Long Beach businessman, introduced Lungren to Nixon. A lifelong
friendship developed.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren worked in Nixon's Senate campaign in 1950 and in the
campaigns of Robert H. Finch, the former lieutenant governor of
California and later Nixon's first secretary of health, education
and welfare.
</P>
<P>
   At Drown's suggestion, Lungren became campaign physician for
Nixon's 1952 vice-presidential bid and continued that role in his
subsequent campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960 campaign, when rumors circulated that Nixon's rival,
John F. Kennedy, had Addison's disease _ an insufficiency of
hormones produced in the adrenal gland _ Nixon asked Lungren about
the condition. According to his son, after Lungren explained it and
said he believed the rumors, Nixon told him that it was ``too
personal'' to use as a campaign issue. The rumors were proved
correct many years after Kennedy's death.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren was a medical consultant to Nixon when he became
president in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren did not want to be a White House physician because he
had to support his wife and seven children, his son said.
</P>
<P>
   Another son, Daniel E. Lungren of Roseville, Calif., was a
congressman and attorney general of California. He was the
Republican nominee for governor in 1998 but lost to Gray Davis. .
</P>
<P>
   Other survivors include his wife, Lorain; a son, Brian F., of
Squaw Valley, Calif.; four daughters, Christine Lungren-Maddalone
of Long Beach, Loretta Lungren-Vestermark of Fishers, Ind.,
Patricia Lungren Partridge of Pasadena, and Elizabeth Lungren Bloom
of Castaic, Calif; and 16 grandchildren.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Isabella Blow, the English stylist, was there in her
Junya Watanabe platter-collar dress and her blue Chinese savant
spectacles and red suede shoes. Michael Roberts, the photographer
and fashion editor of The New Yorker, was there. So was Andre Leon
Talley, the Vogue editor, in a fire-engine-red Prada crocodile
coat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Isabella!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the first day of school,'' Blow said before the
start of Watanabe's show on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three weeks, the fashion crowd has gathered and
regathered for the fall 2000 ready-to-wear collections, in New
York, London, Milan and now here _ clean slate, new day _ Paris.
</P>
<P>
   In a lot of ways, the French collections are like the first day
of school. Expectations run higher here, with so many big names
jostling for attention. There is also the feeling that the action
will be livelier, the clothes more inventive, and the intrigue,
thickening like a good bechamel, closer to uncovering some of the
more rotten aspects behind this ruthlessly chic business.
</P>
<P>
   Namely, that for all the cooing about Paris talent, there is an
equally powerful realization, brought on Monday evening by Marc
Jacobs' show for Louis Vuitton and again Tuesday by John Galliano's
threadbare collection for Christian Dior, that some of the best
talent is being squandered on clothes that nobody expects to be
produced, let alone seen anywhere but on a runway or in a magazine.
Of course, the more commercial clothes are in the back room. Of
course, the name of the game is money-making accessories. Of
course, luxury houses are so mindful of their images they'd rather
burn their clothes than risk seeing them stuck on mark-down racks.
</P>
<P>
   But at some level, down among artists or farmers or those who
equate what they do with who they are, a person who takes himself
seriously as a designer, and expects the same consideration in
return, has to start wondering if it's worth it. Is it worth
designing clothes in a fabulous . . . vacuum?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, to a journalist looking at Galliano's collection _
his limpid reprise of the tramp theme from his recent couture show,
the familiar hodgepodge of funky denim and asymmetrical cuts, the
pointlessness of showing models in see-through slips with faces
that look as if they have taken a swan dive into a jar of Vaseline
_ there was nothing worth commenting on. The rhinestones stuck on
the soles of boots, which only someone looking up at a runway would
notice, said it all: Who needs them?
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs' show had its own problems. While a lot of the clothes
looked cool, particularly low-sashed trench coats in subtle logo
prints and big sweaters that spilled off one shoulder, the
overwhelming impression was that he was taking another trip down
fashion's memory lane. A belted blouson jacket with rounded
shoulders _ think Claude Montana or Thierry Mugler. An oversize
blazer _ think of those slouchy boyfriend coats that sprang out of
``Annie Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the biggest names in French fashion were giving
lessons on drumming up publicity for mundane things like handbags
and scarves. A few were using their noodles, and saying something
new.
</P>
<P>
   There was the diminutive Rei Kawakubo, who hardly looks like the
type to listen to rock 'n' roll, much less relatively obscure bands
like Placebo, opening her brilliant Comme de Garcons show with an
electronic blast and overtones of punk regalia. None of that old
ladylike business for her. She literally took the stuffing out of
that notion by showing jackets exploding with clumps of shredded
wool and what looked like the remains of petticoats. The punk
elements included white coats printed with red lips and razor
blades, but her use of jackets zipping one inside another showed
how Kawakubo can artfully manipulate a current trend.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion's avant-garde were generally in top form. Junya Watanabe
sent out cocoons of glistening, pleated organdy that fanned open
like paper party favors. Yohji Yamamoto's collection, with its
background chanting and Eskimo allusions to a frozen wasteland,
could have amounted to a flaming baked alaska. But then there were
coats in tattered buff suede and old-world tapestries, all set off
by ultraromantic fur hats.
</P>
<P>
   Coats with high Edwardian collars, men with French twists, white
chiffon tops with jodhpurs _ Josephus Thimister made intriguing
points in his show, but they were scattered to the winds.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch design team of Viktor &AMP; Rolf, who made a name as
couturiers despite selling practically nothing, are now making
ready-to-wear, and the collection of natty jeans, ruffled shirts
and sleek pantsuits that draw on their distinctive silhouette is
terrific. Nine American retailers, including Barneys New York and
Linda Dresner, have placed orders, and a clever Stars and Stripes
print from the designers, which turns up on jackets and shirts and
was loosely inspired by the song ``American Pie,'' is proof of
their ingenuity and hidden business sense.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the runway, Valentino opened with fresh-looking
leathers over lacy knits and those ladylike suits in tweed of which
he is the king, but then he wandered into predictable territory
where the lesson is: if you have to repeat yourself, don't show so
many outfits. Gilles Dufour's show for Balmain was a mishmash of
pubescent styles (T-shirts spackled with the word ``Gilles'') and
cloying examples of chic (mint-green satin suits dotted with
Kleenex-like clumps). To borrow from ``Saving Private Ryan,'' it
was as if he fell out of the ugly tree and hit every branch on the
way down.
</P>
<P>
   Alber Elbaz is a lesson unto himself _ how to endure when the
deck seems hopelessly stacked against you. Elbaz arrived at Yves
Saint Laurent three seasons ago fresh from success at Guy Laroche.
He was given the reigns of a design house whose principal designer
is a god, whose men's wear designer, Hedi Slimane, is a star, and
whose owners would soon be selling the house to Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Elbaz was caught in such a bind he probably thought he had to
please Saint Laurent's mother.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he settled down, alas too late, if the rumors are
true and Tom Ford, the house's creative director, who was sitting
front and center, plans to take over by the next collection. The
old wood planks out on the floor were a cue: Elbaz, after trying
awkwardly to push Saint Laurent in a different direction, went back
to basics. That meant a somber silhouette in black and chocolate
brown enlivened with leather shirts and blouses tied chicly at the
neck.
</P>
<P>
   The clothes had a mildly subversive edge, a Saint Laurent
signature, though it would be wrong to think Elbaz was trying to
imitate Slimane's sleek, erotic silhouette. Elbaz was making his
own points, with brown suede dresses, belted and worn with
high-heeled boots, and evening suits and tuxedos in burnished-gold
satin.
</P>
<P>
   There was something odd, even mournful, about Elbaz's hurrah. It
was as if he were not part of the real action, which is taking
place far from his sentimental runway. There was Ford, with Mark
Lee, the new managing director of Saint Laurent, in one corner. In
another corner was Pierre Berge, the former chief executive of
Saint Laurent, sitting next to Betty Catroux, a longtime friend and
muse of Saint Laurent.
</P>
<P>
   In another part of the room was Slimane, who may or may not
leave Saint Laurent. It was a strange confusion of personalities,
very Proustian in its sense of the unspeakable, and it was summed
up in the song that opened the finale: ``Are You Lonesome
Tonight?''

IN A REVERSAL, NASSAU COUNTY GOP LEADERS BACK PROPERTY
REASSESSMENT
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ Faced with a fiscal meltdown and a major
lawsuit challenging Nassau County's antiquated property tax system,
two Republican county officials reversed course Tuesday and agreed
to press for the reassessment of all 415,000 residential and
commercial properties in the county.
</P>
<P>
   The reversal by the officials, County Executive Thomas S.
Gulotta and Charles O'Shea, chairman of the Board of Assessors,
makes reassessment, a longstanding political hot potato that
recently won the support of the Democrat-led County Legislature, a
near certainty. And it sets in motion what is likely to be a long,
politically perilous process that will increase taxes in many of
the wealthiest areas of the county.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, reassessment has been considered too politically
risky, largely out of fears that it would raise property taxes,
especially those of wealthy homeowners who would then take out
their anger at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   But the county's continuing financial crisis, which has led
rating services to downgrade the county's bonds to a level just
above junk, and a lawsuit challenging the current assessments as
racially discriminatory forced the county to act.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of wealthy communities along the North Shore of Long
Island, including Great Neck, Manhasset and Port Washington, stand
to see tax increases, officials say. Homeowners in poorer areas
along the South Shore, like Roosevelt, Freeport and Hempstead, will
probably see their taxes fall.
</P>
<P>
   But the political fallout remains unclear because both Democrats
and Republicans now have their fingerprints on the reassessment
proposal, and because the process, which is expected to take at
least two years, will not be completed before November 2001, when
all 19 county legislators and the county executive are up for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, houses in Nassau County are assessed based on land
costs from 1964 and earlier and building costs from 1938 _ before
the Long Island Expressway was built, before acres of farmland were
sold to developers, and before the construction of Levittown
ushered in a new era in suburban living.
</P>
<P>
   Those tax assessments have remained the same ever since, even
though houses in wealthy, mostly white areas have increased in
value much more than houses in poorer, mostly black and Hispanic
areas. The result is that the owner of a $300,000 house in Garden
City can pay the same $8,000 in property taxes as the owner of a
$110,000 house in Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   O'Shea made his call for reassessment less than a month after
defending the current system as ``fair'' before a hearing of the
County Legislature. He explained his switch by saying that members
of a commission he formed last year to study the system recently
told him that while their work is not yet done, they have concluded
that reassessment is overdue.
</P>
<P>
   His announcement led to an even more stunning turnabout, as
Gulotta said for the first time that he would strongly support
property tax reassessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I have traditionally opposed reassessment,'' he said in
a statement, ``the county's fiscal condition mandates we stop the
hemorrhaging and undertake reassessment with procedures that
provide maximum protection for our homeowners.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came less than a month before opening arguments
are scheduled in a lawsuit filed by the New York Civil Liberties
Union, the state attorney general's office and the Justice
Department. The suit charges that the current tax system
discriminates against black and Hispanic residents.
</P>
<P>
   In supporting reassessment, county officials said they were not
admitting that the current system was discriminatory.

SOTHEBY'S JOINS CHRISTIE'S IN REVISING COMMISSIONS HIGHER AND
NEARLY IDENTICAL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three weeks after Christie's, the auction house
giant, changed its commissions because of a federal antitrust
investigation, Sotheby's revised its rates as well Tuesday, making
them nearly identical to those of its rival.
</P>
<P>
   The two houses are under investigation for possibly colluding to
set commissions for buyers and sellers on the billions of dollars
of fine and decorative art and collectibles they auction every
year.
</P>
<P>
   In public statements over the last several weeks, officials of
both companies did not deny that such activity took place and said
they were cooperating with prosecutors. Tuesday they greeted
questions about whether they had been in communication with each
other over the new rates with laughter and denials.
</P>
<P>
   The Sotheby's announcement comes as the auction houses are
settling on the art they will offer at their important May sales in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   While both companies will be charging more than they used to,
the biggest change is that buying at a live Sotheby's auction,
rather than on the Internet, is now more expensive than at
Christie's for purchases under $30,000. Christie's, on the other
hand, is costlier at the higher end. For any purchases of $100,000
or more, it will cost bidders $250 more to buy at Christie's than
Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did this in light of the competitive environment we're
in,'' said William F. Ruprecht, Sotheby's new president and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new Sotheby's structure, sellers will be charged a fee
based on the amount of art and objects they have bought and sold
over a calendar year at the auction house. Previously sellers paid
a fixed scale of charges ranging from 2 percent to 20 percent based
on the value of the property sold during a calendar year.
Christie's new selling structure is the same.
</P>
<P>
   The fees both houses will charge buyers differs. Since 1993 both
auction houses had been charging 15 percent on the first $50,000
and 10 percent on the rest. Now Sotheby's will charge a 10 percent
fee on all Internet sales. For its live auctions it will charge 20
percent on the first $15,000; 15 percent on purchases from $15,000
to $100,000; and 10 percent on amounts over $100,000. Christie's
will increase its buyer's premium to 17.5 percent on the first
$80,000 and maintain the premium of 10 percent on any amount above
that. Dealers reacted to the announcement enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   James Goodman, a Manhattan dealer specializing in contemporary
art, said he was happy with the news. ``This is good for the
dealers,'' he said. ``I can't get 20 percent for the art I sell.
This will make it easier for dealers to do business.''
</P>
<P>
   The new rates are both designed to favor sellers. Historically
both companies have wooed sellers to secure multimillion-dollar
collections, often eliminating fees altogether, publishing glossy
hard-back catalogs, making donations to family charities and
offering marketing strategies that included traveling exhibitions,
cocktail receptions and splashy advertising campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But for buyers the perks are minimal and the charges
considerable. Buyers get a guarantee of authenticity and free
advice from experts, but aside from that, auctions are an
ever-more-expensive luxury.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's has one significant change from Christie's. In
calculating the commission rates for sellers, Sotheby's will
include the results of both live auctions and Internet auctions.
That is an advantage for Sotheby's, which has invested $40 million
in two Internet sites, one with Amazon.com and the other on its
own. Christie's does not hold auctions on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the seller we're creating value in all parts of our
business by allowing people who buy on the internet the ability to
add these purchases to their aggregate transactions,'' Ruprecht
said.
</P>
<P>
   Historically the two companies have copied each other's fees
slavishly. While they met openly to set the annual auction
schedules, prosecutors are now questioning whether they held secret
meetings to fix fees.
</P>
<P>
   When Christie's announced its new fee structure on Feb. 7,
people close to the investigation said it was a move to separate
themselves from the allegations of collusion. But Sotheby's,
competing for high-end property to sell in May, was forced to
follow with the structure that was announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   This game of tag between the two houses has existed for years.
In 1992, Sotheby's increased the buyer's commission from a fee of
10 percent. Seven weeks later Christie's followed. Similar changes
came in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two companies, Sotheby's is in the hot seat right now.
Last week its chairman, A. Alfred Taubman, resigned, as did its
president and chief executive, Diana D. Brooks. Last month
Christie's announced it gave federal investigators information
about ``possible conduct'' at the firm that was relevant to the
antitrust investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for its cooperation it was ``conditionally
accepted'' into a Justice Department program through which it will
win leniency from prosecutors. Both auction houses are also facing
investigations in Europe and Australia. Sotheby's, being a public
company, is also facing shareholder lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Sotheby's fell $1.625 Tuesday, to $19.6875.

violinist, entered the rehearsal hall of the Shanghai Municipal
Orchestra and approached its Italian conductor, Mario Paci. The
orchestra was preparing for a concert to be held on March 26, the
100th anniversary of Beethoven's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The orchestra was all foreigners,'' Tan said recently. ``The
rule was, they played in Shanghai for five years and then got one
year paid furlough. I knew they were missing a violinist, so I
asked if I could play.''
</P>
<P>
   This was no ordinary request: since the orchestra's founding in
1879 as the Shanghai Municipal Public Band, no Chinese musician had
ever joined its ranks. The orchestra was created by and for the
foreign residents of Shanghai who had lived in self-governing
concession areas since the Opium War in 1842.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paci just looked at me,'' Tan continued. ``Then he said, `Come
tomorrow.''' Tan appeared the next day and played in every
remaining rehearsal and concert. As the season drew to a close, a
Chinese worker in charge of laying out scores urged him to ask
Maestro Paci for his salary. Tan demurred but finally mustered
enough courage to ask if he was to be paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' came the reply. ``This is a chance for you to
study.''
</P>
<P>
   Tan, who later became vice director of the Shanghai Conservatory
and a renowned violin teacher and maker, was untroubled by this
rebuff. ``I didn't care about the money,'' he said. ``My goal was
to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, as it has been called
since 1953, celebrated its 120th anniversary. As the nation's
oldest symphony orchestra, it has done more to promote the
development of symphonic music in China than any other institution.
</P>
<P>
   Its claim to the title ``best orchestra in the Far East,''
bestowed in the 1930s, is long past. But if judged on the basis of
perseverance and dedication in the face of seemingly insurmountable
odds, the Shanghai Symphony stands alone.
</P>
<P>
   It began humbly, as an amateur band of Filipino musicians. After
the International Settlement, run by the Shanghai Municipal
Council, took it over in 1881, it gradually became more
professional. In 1906, the council recruited a German conductor and
six European musicians, but when World War I broke out, the German
musicians were drafted into military service and the German members
of the symphony's board of directors expelled. Paci arrived in
1919, beginning a 23-year tenure still respectfully known as the
Paci era.
</P>
<P>
   He changed the band's name to Shanghai Municipal Orchestra in
1922 and replaced the missing Germans with White Russians and Jews,
who came to Shanghai seeking sanctuary. He broadened the repertory
to include works by composers like Stravinsky, Bartok and Gershwin,
and increased the number of musicians from 37 to more than 50.
</P>
<P>
   As the quality of the orchestra improved, it began to attract
international attention and world-renowned soloists, including
Fritz Kreisler, Jascha Heifetz, Fyodor Chaliapin and Dietrich
Fischer-Dieskau. In 1930, Paci made headlines by leading the
orchestra in its first work by a Chinese composer, ``In Memoriam''
by Huang Zi, who had studied at Oberlin College and Yale.
</P>
<P>
   Concert attendees had remained as foreign as the orchestra; when
Arthur Rubinstein performed in Shanghai in 1935, he complained that
the audience was all European and American. But the appearance of
musicians like Tan began to attract a Chinese audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody had ever seen a Chinese in the orchestra,'' Tan said,
``So many people came to see me.'' The orchestra officially
admitted Chinese in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   It struggled through the wartime years of soaring inflation and
Japanese occupation. Paci laid down his baton in 1942, and Tan quit
in protest when a concert was scheduled in honor of a Japanese
general.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist victory in 1949 brought peace and a stable
currency, but it also ignited a debate: could a symphony orchestra
serve the needs of workers, peasants and soldiers? At a conference
held to discuss arts policy in Beijing, leftists argued that it
should be abolished; moderates, among them Tan and He Luting, later
the director of the Shanghai Conservatory, argued for its
preservation. The moderates won, and the Shanghai Symphony was
placed under the baton of Huang Yijun and the control of the
Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Shanghai Symphony survived, its problems with
politics were just beginning. In 1950, cries for its abolition were
heard again after it played selections from ``Madame Butterfly,''
which leftists argued was an effort to spread imperialist culture
even as China fought against the imperialist United States in
Korea. Walking a fine line, the Shanghai Symphony managed both to
preserve its integrity and to adapt to the times.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign symphony members were replaced by Chinese: in 1951 the
56-member Shanghai Symphony still had 16 foreigners, but by 1958 it
was all Chinese, with Soviet advisers on hand to offer support and
training. Huang expanded the repertory to include more Chinese
compositions.
</P>
<P>
   Music, like all other art forms, was required to follow the
Communist Party's dictates to be realistic and to ``reflect
society.'' Composers strove to create Chinese symphonic music that
integrated Western concepts of harmony and form with Chinese
melodies, often drawn from folk songs or the music of minority
nationalities. Programmatic music was favored, especially vocal
works, because they were easier for workers, peasants and soldiers
to understand.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1960s, politics became more intrusive. During the Four
Pests Campaign, conservatory students were forced to stand under
trees and make noise with their instruments: afraid to land,
sparrows (considered pests) fell from the sky and died.
</P>
<P>
   The Sino-Soviet split in 1961 led to the departure of Soviet
advisers, and orchestra rehearsal time was devoted to studying the
``nine criticisms'' of Khrushchev. A campaign was launched against
``formalism,'' condemning ``ivory tower'' music that sprang from a
composer's feelings rather than the real experience of the people.
</P>
<P>
   With the onset of the Cultural Revolution in 1966, Western music
was condemned as bourgeois. Jiang Qing, the wife of Chairman Mao,
created eight ``model operas'' that became the only theatrical
pieces staged in all of China, their melodies reorchestrated as
``revolutionary symphonies,'' which the Shanghai Symphony sometimes
performed attired in soldiers' uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 10 years, the Shanghai Symphony played only `Shajiabang'
and `Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy,''' Chen Guangxian, the
manager of the Shanghai Symphony said, referring to two model
operas re-orchestrated for symphony. Red Guards tormented Shanghai
Symphony musicians and conservatory professors, accusing them of
betraying China, its music and its people by playing Western music.
</P>
<P>
   So merciless was the abuse that 10 professors and seven students
at the conservatory were said to have been driven to suicide. Tan
was locked in a conservatory closet for nine months and beaten
regularly with a stick, then sent to repair toilets. At the
Shanghai Symphony, Gu Shengying, 30, a piano soloist, committed
suicide together with her family, and Lu Hongen, the resident
conductor, was executed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Cultural Revolution ended with Mao's death in September
1976, and that November, the Central Philharmonic Orchestra in
Beijing held a concert broadcast nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played Beethoven's Fifth,'' said Xu Ximing, director of
the Shanghai Music Lovers' Association. ``It is about the light
that comes after a period of great difficulty, so it was very
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Orchestras and conservatories around the nation began the
arduous process of rebuilding. When the Central Conservatory in
Beijing reopened in 1977, 40,000 people applied; applications to
the Shanghai Conservatory were close behind. Overseas orchestras
traveled to China, famous musicians offered master classes, and
audiences increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1980s, everyone wanted to hear Beethoven,'' Chen said.
``People lined up to buy tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   Young composers began to explore new compositional techniques.
But because realism and the preservation of Chinese music remained
official policy, experimental efforts like atonality were
criticized. Zhu Jianer, the Shanghai Symphony's resident composer,
traveled to Beijing to defend the work of young composers like Tan
Dun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I explained that the roots of their music actually lay in the
music of the Chinese nationalities,'' Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that symphonic music was revived in the 1980s,
many composers and musicians emigrated. Then, as economic reforms
advanced and popular entertainment options increased, government
financing and attendance at classical concerts declined. The
Shanghai Symphony struggled to pay wages, and its musicians were
forced to moonlight in hotel lobbies.
</P>
<P>
   Money remains a problem. The Shanghai Symphony's 94 musicians
are underpaid and their instruments, which belong to the orchestra,
need replacement. Although the orchestra's foundation solicits
corporate contributions, few are forthcoming, and the orchestra
remains almost exclusively dependent on government support.
</P>
<P>
   The symphony is regularly called to play for political
celebrations, often on short notice, making it difficult to
maintain a regular training schedule or plan a season. Concert
attendance has increased, but audience development is still a
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to propagate classical music,'' Xu said. ``We have to
train people from childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   The traditional Communist idea of cultural outreach is to ``go
down to the countryside'' and take culture to the masses, but
moving an orchestra to a cornfield or shipyard is so cumbersome
that the Shanghai Symphony does so only a few times a year.
</P>
<P>
   A more constructive approach would be to bring audiences to the
concert hall, but this is difficult because the orchestra does not
have its own facility. Concerts are held in the Shanghai Concert
Hall, originally a movie theater, or the new Grand Theater. Both
spaces must be rented, and neither is acoustically suited for a
symphony orchestra, a sore point with the musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the orchestra's future looks brighter. Musically, it has
grown under the baton of Chen Xieyang, its music director since
1984. The string sections have played together for years and have a
balanced ensemble and flowing sound, though the woodwind and brass
sections are weaker than the strings.
</P>
<P>
   It is common here to attribute this weakness to physical
deficiencies in Chinese people, but the real explanation lies in
the quality of conservatory faculty and students. China has little
tradition of secondary school ensemble programs like marching
bands, so conservatories must recruit wind players with almost no
ensemble experience.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing history full circle, the Shanghai Symphony is
compensating by recruiting woodwind and brass players from the
United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Financial support for recruitment comes from the Shanghai
government, which hopes to make the city more attractive by
improving its cultural institutions. Additional funds for training
have also been allocated, and Chen, the orchestra manager, has
arranged for a steady stream of foreign conductors to work with the
symphony.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra is also striving to meet international standards
on issues like copyrights, royalties and artist contracts. It tours
overseas regularly and often gives concerts in other Chinese
cities.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate its 120th anniversary, the Shanghai Symphony paid
homage to its origins in East and West. Chen, the music director,
led a concert of works by Zhu Jianer and Beethoven. A conference on
the development of symphonic music was held and a commemorative
book published.
</P>
<P>
   The book paid special tribute to the orchestra's foreign
founders, its first Chinese musicians and the musicians who lost
their lives in the Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling his time locked in a closet, Tan said that endurance
and faith were his keys to survival: ``I just thought, `It's night
now, but the sun will come out eventually.'''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, has the Shanghai Symphony held together through wars,
purges, political movements and financial crises: with endurance,
faith and an unwavering devotion to music.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The proposed merger of America Online and Time
Warner drew skeptical questioning Tuesday from the Senate Judiciary
Committee, as lawmakers challenged a new pledge by the companies to
open Time Warner's cable television system to other Internet
service providers once the deal is completed.
</P>
<P>
   The pledge, announced just hours before the panel's hearing, was
not binding, but it provided a framework for how the two companies
would ensure that consumers have access over Time Warner Cable to
service providers other than AOL.
</P>
<P>
   Central to the framework is a provision that allows consumers to
choose Internet providers not affiliated with AOL Time Warner and
still get high-speed, or broadband, services over cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts said the memorandum tried to ease the concerns
of regulators, online rivals and other open-access advocates that
the proposed $165 billion merger could limit competition in the
hotly contested Internet field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way to deflect FTC scrutiny of this merger,'' said Gary
Arlen, an analyst with Arlen Communications, a market research
concern that studies interactive media. ``It certainly is
politically motivated, but it's also just the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, who heads the judiciary panel, said
the commitment was vague and nonbinding, and he urged the companies
to condition their merger on a more detailed, ironclad agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe a degree of healthy skepticism is in order, given
what is at stake here,'' Hatch said. ``Given that this document
lacks both enforceability and specificity, this committee remains
to be convinced of its value beyond the boardroom and public
relations office of AOL-Time Warner.''
</P>
<P>
   Before its decision to acquire Time Warner, which has extensive
cable assets, AOL pushed for the government to require open access
to cable systems by Internet-service providers. Now, AOL seems to
have joined the ranks of cable operators, like AT&AMP;T, in calling for
a voluntary approach.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has no formal role in the merger, which the Federal
Trade Commission is now reviewing to ensure it complies with
federal antitrust laws. Such reviews are supposed to be free from
all political considerations.
</P>
<P>
   But several House and Senate committees have broad legislative
and oversight responsibilities for issues that affect the industry,
like privacy concerns and open access.
</P>
<P>
   In their first testimony on Capitol Hill since announcing their
planned merger six weeks ago, Stephen M. Case, AOL's chief
executive officer, and Gerald M. Levin, his counterpart at Time
Warner, took pains to underscore their commitment to open access,
vigorous free-market competition, technical innovation,
journalistic excellence and privacy concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, those were also the senators' main areas of
concern. ``We share the same goal,'' Case said. ``Protecting
consumers and their families and establishing a new standard of
privacy and security for the digital age, while permitting the
Internet to flourish in these changing times.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin said the merger would be a boon to consumers of music,
movies, publishing, communications and financial services.
``Although the age we've entered will be brutally unsparing of
companies that can't or won't move fast enough, it will also
empower citizens as never before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But many senators, while acknowledging the merger would likely
be approved, were not sold on its merits. ``This proposed merger
reminds me of `A Tale of Two Cities' with portents of either the
best of times or the worst of times,'' said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy,
D-Vt., the panel's ranking Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Some senators, like Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., who said the
proposed merger offered ``an exciting marriage,'' voiced few
qualms.
</P>
<P>
   But the response from Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, was more
typical: ``The more I examine this deal, the more I am convinced
that it does raise significant competition and public policy issues
that must be thoroughly explored.''

THE GUSTATORY LIFE OF DINING-SCENE ROYALS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Picholine? 21?'' asks Tim Zagat, his cell phone
poised, as his driver attacks midtown traffic. ``Whatever
restaurant in the city you want!''
</P>
<P>
   Reservation, shmeservation.
</P>
<P>
   Picholine, he suggests, will be quiet at lunch, perfect for
conversation. At the 21 Club, ``We'll be interrupted because we'll
have to say hello to so many people!'' His eyes gleam. When the
choice is tossed back to him, the answer is predictable.
</P>
<P>
   Nina, his wife, checks her Palm Pilot for 21's phone number.
``This is Mr. Zagat,'' Zagat says. ``Can you take us?'' It is peak
lunchtime rush hour. ``If we can be in the front section? Well, do
your best. We'll be there in five minutes. And tell the chef we're
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later, when the Zagats sweep into 21, their rings
are kissed and their desired table awaits.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Tim nor Nina Zagat votes in the restaurant surveys, so
they do not bother trying to remain anonymous. But as acknowledged
king and queen of the dining scene, descending upon restaurants
eight times a week, their influence is such a given that it is
merrily tweaked in the current Off Broadway hit ``Fully
Committed.''
</P>
<P>
   And if publishing 35 different vox populi guides to restaurants,
resorts and, beginning next week, New York City's nightlife
(undertaken by their elder princeling, Ted Zagat, 25) couldn't snag
them a good table anywhere and anytime, then last month's
announcement of their Internet invasion, reinforced by $31 million
from food-loving venture capitalists, ought to clinch it.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the voice of the plebeians has been very, very good to
them: Even before this infusion, the enterprise that began as a
freebie Xeroxed restaurant survey by the Zagats' friends in 1979
now has revenues of more than $20 million. On Monday, the Zagats
expanded their offices at 4 Columbus Circle, tripling their space
for 75 employees, many of them itchy dot-commers and law firm
refugees half the age of Mom (57) and Pop (59) Zagat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little hard to tell them what to do,'' Zagat says,
rolling his eyes. Mrs. Zagat adds, ``These kids want a playroom for
a Ping-Pong table or foosball. And a place to keep their dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   As Zagat eagerly scans 21's dining room, Mrs. Zagat _ usually
more cautious, organized and, by the way, Cordon Bleu trained _ is
bubbling about the future site, the risk she persuaded her husband
to spend millions on. She envisions online reservations, menus,
restaurant locators, merchandising, and greater capacity to conduct
surveys. ``Nina used to be my wife,'' cracks Zagat. ``Now she's my
Webmistress.''
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't quite gotten the hang of e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Zagat is the expansive, bearlike one _ ``I'm bombastic in a
warm and fuzzy way,'' he proclaims _ the dreamer, glad-hander, tour
leader and philosophizer. He says things like, ``We've codified the
power of the people; that's why we're powerful.'' (``Codify'' comes
readily to the Yale Law School graduate and former top lawyer for
Gulf &AMP; Western. He and his wife, who joined the survey full time a
decade ago after years as a lawyer embroiled in the battles over
the Johnson &AMP; Johnson fortune, met at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, when Tim helped compel prestige restaurants to offer
$19.92 prix fixe lunches during the Democratic Convention, he has
been promoting the city's leisure life. He is now chairman of NYC &AMP;
Co., which oversees the city's Convention and Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   So last year, when Tim began talking up a ``Diner's Bill of
Rights'' _ common-sense basics ranging from courteous service to
the ability to send back unsatisfactory food without charge _
attention had to be paid, although restaurateurs' eyebrows were
raised.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than complaining to management about a meal, ``most
people prefer not to be confrontational,'' Zagat says. ``They
swallow their unhappiness but they just won't come back.
Restaurateurs would prefer to know right then.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Zagat, who, when her husband pauses for breath, steps
forward as a cozy woman who's fun to gab with, is fretting: she's
pushing her fork around 21's chicken hash, a signature dish. She is
dissatisfied with its cream sauce and also guilt-ridden, having
urged their dining companion to order it.
</P>
<P>
   The manager, Bryan McGuire, inquires about the meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a very good lunch!'' she says brightly.
</P>
<P>
   Why not tell the truth?
</P>
<P>
   She whispers: ``I think my not liking the chicken hash was my
fault. I should have asked how it was prepared. I was imagining
crispy.''
</P>
<P>
   Zagat: ``You're being defensive!''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Zagat: ``I'm not being defensive, am I?'' (At regular
intervals during the afternoon, she apologizes about the chicken
hash.)
</P>
<P>
   Tim Zagat booms across the room: ``Bryan! She hated it!''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout a 35-year marriage it has been like this: two smart,
adroit people with their pleasure centers well exercised, both from
comfortable New York-area families, checking and balancing each
other, picking food off each others' plates, building a lifestyle
that has occupational hazards most people can only dream of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest problem,'' he says, ``is having to insist to
owners that we pay the bill.''
</P>
<P>
   She says: ``And it's really a problem when chefs keep sending
out an extra dish of this or that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At a certain point,'' he adds, ``there's just too much food.''

TRANSFORMING DYLAN'S WORDS INTO HIGH ART  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 5) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Bob Dylan was an acerbic young folk singer warning that the
times were a-changin', one change he probably did not envision was
that he would become a darling of the high-art world. Yet last
fall, nearly 40 years after he made his first records, Dylan was
declared one of the greatest artists of the 20th century by Andrew
Motion, the British poet laureate.
</P>
<P>
   And now the composer John Corigliano, commissioned to write a
song cycle for the soprano Sylvia McNair's Carnegie Hall recital in
New York City on March 15, has produced `` Tambourine Man: Seven
Songs of Bob Dylan,'' a 35-minute song cycle that is largely as its
title suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Largely, but not entirely. The word ``songs'' suggests that
Corigliano, a composer known for his accessibly melodic style, has
merely spiffed up Dylan's music with a high-toned crossover
accompaniment. Not so. Corigliano insists, however implausibly,
that he has never heard Dylan's music. But he selected a group of
lyrics from a collection of Dylan's work and treated them as he
would anyone else's poetry: he set them as he felt them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I may have heard them in the background and not
focused on them,'' said Corigliano, who, now 62, was in his 20s in
the 1960s, when Dylan came to prominence and when Joan Baez, Peter,
Paul and Mary, the Byrds and Manfred Mann recorded hit versions of
his songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was when I was getting my skills in the contemporary
orchestral repertory. I was listening to late Stravinsky and
Penderecki. I knew show music. I knew Rodgers and Hammerstein. But
I didn't really listen to much rock music. I heard the Beatles, who
were fascinating because of what they were doing musically, and I'm
not saying I wouldn't have found Dylan fascinating had I turned my
attention to him. But I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Corigliano maintains that this gap in his musical experience
allowed him to encounter Dylan's lyrics uninfluenced by the
songwriter's own ideas. Once he decided to write the cycle, he went
out of his way to avoid Dylan's music. When McNair started to sing
``Blowin' in the Wind'' for him at one point, he made her stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Dylan first heard about this, his response was, `Well,
this is how they go; it's done,''' said Corigliano, who did not
speak to Dylan directly but negotiated for permission to use the
lyrics through his manager, Jeff Rosen. ``And the way I put it was,
`Wouldn't you be curious to see what someone with no musical
preconceptions, who comes from a completely different world from
yours, would do with poetry of yours that he finds moving and
beautiful?'
</P>
<P>
   ``He might not like what I've done. I'm not sure he will. But if
the poetry is good, it can stand it, just as a poem by Goethe can
stand different settings by Schumann, Brahms or Wolf. And I think
it (italics)is(end italics) good, otherwise I wouldn't have set
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly why Dylan agreed to the project is unknown. He did not
respond to a question faxed through his publicity agent, and Rosen
refused to comment. But Corigliano and McNair jumped through a few
hoops to obtain Dylan's permission. ``There was a lot of collecting
of credentials about a year ago,'' McNair said. ``We had to list
the Grammys we had each won, and all the cities in the United
States and Europe where the songs would be performed. We had to
prove we were the real thing.''
</P>
<P>
   A difference between Goethe and Dylan, of course, is that Goethe
wrote his poetry as poetry, with little concern about whether it
would be set to music. Dylan's songs were written as songs, and
their words are fitted closely to their melodies. Corigliano
rejects this distinction as too narrow.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, maybe Dylan bought Corigliano's Goethe argument. Or
maybe he was just curious.
</P>
<P>
   What he will hear, if he listens to the cycle, is the difference
between his directness and Corigliano's artfulness. In place of the
simple, flowing melody that listeners associate with ``Blowin' in
the Wind,'' for example, Corigliano has written a highly chromatic
setting, marked ``solemn'' in the score, and mostly in the lopsided
meter of five beats to the bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clothes Line,'' originally in a blues form edged with Dylan's
wry humor, is now a complex structure in which the time signature
changes almost every bar, and the dialogue within the song has been
marked ``him'' and ``her'' and set in corresponding ranges.
</P>
<P>
   It is music for virtuoso performers. The vocal line has leaps of
a 12th (an octave and a half) in either direction. The pianist
(Martin Katz, at McNair's recital) has a tough job, too. He is
asked to create overtone effects to suggest bells in ``Chimes of
Freedom'' and to play a brisk accompaniment for `` Tambourine
Man,'' in which the right hand plays in the key of F sharp and the
left hand is in the key of C.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got the score, about three weeks ago,'' McNair said,
``I thought, `Why me?' There are some very, very difficult things
in this song cycle. There are huge melodic leaps, which I always
find difficult. And keeping track of the meter changes _ there are
places where the meter changes 6, 8, 10 times per page. I've had to
learn to sing a tritone as easily as a whole step, and a minor
ninth as easily as an octave. But your ears get used to it, and it
becomes simpler after a while. And as a musician, I'm in awe of the
architecture of this piece.''
</P>
<P>
   When Carnegie Hall invited Corigliano to write a song cycle for
McNair, he did not have any text ideas in mind; in fact, when the
New York Philharmonic commissioned him around the same time to
write a work for the ``Messages for the Millennium'' series it was
to present last November, he wrote the wordless ``Vocalise,'' in
which McNair was the soloist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strange,'' he said. ``I'll be reading poems I like, and
one word or phrase will seem clumsy or unsettable, and will ruin it
for me. So I've not been able to set many poets.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair's one request was that Corigliano set works by an
American poet, and on a whim, he decided to buy a book of Dylan's
work. It was a surprise to McNair.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came up with the idea of setting Dylan on his own,'' McNair
said. ``Originally, we were going to bat ideas about texts back and
forth, and we did that a bit. Then the next thing I knew, he had a
big book of Dylan's lyrics and was trying to get permission to set
some of them. I thought that was great. I'm realizing _ finally, in
my early 40s _ that Bob Dylan has been one of the great thinkers of
my lifetime. I read these poems over and over, and I am
fascinated.''
</P>
<P>
   Corigliano, who typically works out an almost architectural plan
for his compositions before he begins writing the music, originally
chose more than a dozen lyrics, then narrowed them to seven that
fell into what he regarded as a logical order: ``Tambourine Man''
is a prelude of sorts, and ``Clothes Line'' struck him as a
charmingly innocent foil for the more worldly wise ``Blowin' in the
Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Masters of War'' and ``All Along the Watchtower'' represent
political fury and an apocalyptic view of the future, after which
``Chimes of Freedom'' and ``Forever Young'' offer a brighter vision
and a closing benediction.
</P>
<P>
   Corigliano sent his final revisions to McNair only two weeks
ago, and he is about to take a break before thinking about
transforming his String Quartet into his Second Symphony, for the
Boston Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, between this and `Vocalise,''' he said, ``I've spent
the last year and a half writing for Sylvia. Sylvia, Sylvia,
Sylvia.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he should write her an encore. After all, there's an
excerpt from Shakespeare's ``Two Gentlemen of Verona,'' famous as a
Schubert song, ``An Silvia'' (``Who Is Sylvia?''), that is surely
due for a new setting.

 Kevin Giordano is a writer and dance critic living in New York
City.  
 By KEVIN GIORDANO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Until recently, the 80-seat Flea, on White Street in
TriBeCa, has been thought of mainly as an Off Off Broadway theater.
Its productions have included Mac Wellman's ``Infrared''; ``Chere
Maitre,'' starring Irene Worth; Rudy Stern's Theater of Light and
``Benten Kozo,'' a Kabuki play, which won an Obie.
</P>
<P>
   And the three-year-old theater, which has given itself a broad
mandate to be an irritant to the establishment, is no stranger to
controversy: in 1998, Karen Finley appeared there in ``The Return
of the Chocolate-Smeared Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Flea has also presented comedians like the maniacal Rick
Shapiro and music concerts of 20th-century composers and jazz. And
now it is becoming known downtown as a dance venue hoping to give
some competition to more established spaces like P.S. 122, Dixon
Place, the Joyce SoHo and the Kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   This month the Flea is presenting ``Get Up! Two,'' a free
festival of short dances by more than 15 choreographers that will
run Tuesday nights at 8:30 through March 21. ``Get Up! Two,'' now
in its second season (thus the ``Two''), will feature the Bessie
Award-winners David Neumann and Headlong Dance Theater, along with
Jeanine Durning, Nami Yamamoto and Mark Heim, among others.
</P>
<P>
   The program's hosts will be Timothy (Speed) Levitch, the tour
guide in the documentary film ``The Cruise,'' and the 20-year-old
stand-up comic Louis Schwadron, in addition to a 4-year-old named
Henry who will tell jokes between performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to show short works each night and make it really
fun,'' says Lizzie Simon, the Flea's creative producer. ``What
we're interested in is just having it be interactive, exciting and
exhilarating.'' Jim Simpson, the theater's director and founder,
adds: ``What I wanted was the tried and true people,
(italics)and(end italics) those who weren't heard of. I thought,
`Let's make it free and invite the dance community.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Flea can offer occasional free events because it operates
seven days a week, often layering two paying shows, ranging in
price from $12 to $35, in one evening. The ``Get Up! Two'' festival
follows two other dance programs that charged admission.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the theater presented Sara East Johnson's
all-female group Lava in ``Lava Love,'' which featured trapeze
artists and modern-dance movement. And in January, Nicholas
Leichter Dance, a modern-dance company, enjoyed a three-week run.
</P>
<P>
   The nascent dance program at the Flea can be traced directly to
Simon, who is 23. As a child in Providence, R.I., she acted in
theater, on radio and in film before going to a private school at
13. She later attended Columbia, majoring in American history and
graduating in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While there, she worked at WKCR, the university's FM station,
where she still produces the weekly talk show ``Art Attack,'' in
which she interviews artists. Through WKCR she met Steve Greco, a
founder of Platform.net, an Internet urban-youth-culture magazine,
and began writing freelance articles for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized she had a big career in front of her and lots of
ambition,'' says Greco, who is a former editor at Interview
magazine. ``And it was kind of my duty to serve that in a way, as
others helped me when I was young.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Greco, a member of the committee that hands out the New
York Dance and Performance Awards (known as the Bessies),
recommended Simon as a possible member. ``We wanted a range in
ages,'' Greco says. ``We needed young people.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon, who was 21 at the time, remembers the invitation: ``I was
like, `Why do they want (italics)me?'(end italics) I was the
youngest by at least 15 years.'' As a member of the Bessie panel,
Simon saw a lot of dance and performance art. ``It was kind of a
crash course on what's going on,'' she says. ``It gave me
confidence I otherwise might not have had.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon was planning to attend law school when she spoke with
Simpson one night before interviewing him for her radio show. ``I
think we started talking about being child actors,'' recalls Simon,
who learned that Simpson was also an actor in his youth, in theater
and television.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson offered her a job, on spec, as program director for
music at the Flea. ``I could see she was very sharp,'' Simpson
says. ``I knew she was part of the Bessies and liked performers.''
At the time, Simpson was producing and directing but needed another
producer. ``Originally, I had a board of directors full of artists,
and we were going to produce our own work,'' he says. ``It turned
out not to be a viable solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the summer of 1998, Simon has put together more than 40
music concerts and more than a dozen full-scale theatrical events
at the Flea. Impressed by Simon's work, Simpson was amenable to the
idea of having dance performances.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Flea's first dance event was actually a dancer-theater piece
in October 1998, Wellman's ``Girl Gone'' with Annie-B Parson's Big
Dance Theater. Feeling the show was a success, Simon asked a
childhood friend who was a dancer, Ayla Yavin, to help her organize
a dance festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a bunch of submissions and we went out seeing stuff,''
Simon recalls. The first ``Get Up!'' was the result.
</P>
<P>
   The program featured 16 choreographers, including Leichter,
Neumann and Durning. ``I had not seen an audience like that
before,'' says Leichter, who performed a solo in the festival.
``People were unafraid to feel something.'' Leichter's performance
was such a success with the audience, and with the producers, that
Simon and Simpson offered him a season this January.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson of Lava was performing at the Kitchen last spring and
wanted to do another run somewhere else. ``I heard the Flea was
doing dance,'' Johnson recalls. ``It's great as a dance space, and
the most appealing thing is that they're interested in doing longer
runs.'' Lava's run in September was so successful it was extended
through October.
</P>
<P>
   As a dance venue, however, the Flea is in fact not ideal. The
1865 cast-iron building, once an avant-garde film house where Andy
Warhol showed his work, then an art gallery, has a 24-by-44-foot
performing space, which will almost certainly preclude the
appearance of larger dance companies.
</P>
<P>
   There are no wings or backstage area, and, some dancers say, the
floors may not be the best. ``Obviously, it's not the place for a
large company,'' Greco says. ``I see it really great for solo and
small ensemble work, and conceptual. The intimacy promotes great
focus and careful attention.''
</P>
<P>
   But intimacy is only one of the selling points. The first
advantage, Simpson says, is offering choreographers long runs and
the possibility to extend, which is rare in dance. ``What I
discovered was that dancers perform maybe two weeks a year,'' he
says. ``For them to get a long run was something I was deeply
interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many other nonprofit theaters, the Flea sometimes allows
performers to take 100 percent of the gate, while requiring them to
pay the overhead for each night. They can then make all production
decisions, from the design of programs to ticket price ($20 to $25
is usual) to number of performances.
</P>
<P>
   The theater can also be literally transformed for each event. In
the case of ``Lava Love,'' Simpson had a temporary balcony
suspended over the regular floor seats to enhance the excitement of
watching trapeze artists. For Leichter's performance he set up an
area for a DJ.
</P>
<P>
   Simon's criterion for choosing dance is relatively simple. ``I
see a lot of dance that doesn't resonate with me; it's either
boring or academic,'' she says. ``Dance is festive. It's supposed
to be fun and joyous. I'm not saying I think dance should be one
big party, but the whole experience can be exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   During this year's ``Get Up! Two,'' Simon will have an eye out
for performers she thinks are ready for a full season. ``I'm on the
lookout for someone like Nick or Sara,'' she says, referring to
Leichter and Johnson. ``I'd like to be presenting three seasons a
year of choreographers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the Flea as a place where a quantum leap happens in
dancers' careers,'' she adds. ``If they're ready, it's a beautiful
and comfortable place.''

 &HT;    McCain marks Bush as regional candidate
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAKERSFIELD, Calif. _ John McCain tried to paint George W. Bush
as a regional candidate Tuesday after Bush easily won Virginia's
primary.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator said that he has a broad enough appeal to
help Republicans re-capture the White House in November. In
particular, McCain said, California would go to the Democrats in
the fall if the Texas governor is the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was hoping for a split verdict Tuesday, balancing
Virginia's results with a win in Washington state that he could use
as a springboard to the March 7 primary in California. He has
expected the loss in the North Dakota caucuses, a format that
favors a candidate with superior organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems as if he has a Southern strategy, doing well in
Southern states,'' McCain said of his rival, shortly after calling
to congratulate Bush on his victory in Virginia. ``We'll look
forward to Super Tuesday, when we have a broad section, a
cross-section of America voting all on that same day.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also won South Carolina's primary last month, but McCain
has defeated him in Arizona, Michigan and New Hampshire. Bush won
the Iowa caucuses and the Delaware primary, but McCain did not
campaign in either state.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of who would be the stronger candidate in the general
election ran through McCain's remarks as he campaigned in the
nation's largest state Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in California, I have found my Republican friends
yearning for victory ... It's time to put California back in the
winning column,'' McCain said at a news conference in Stockton,
Calif. ``I now firmly believe that I, only, can make that happen
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the importance of California's March 7 primary to
his chances against Bush, McCain reversed course Tuesday and agreed
to participate in a debate with Bush and Alan Keyes on Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he would take part in the CNN-Los Angeles Times
debate via satellite, perhaps from St. Louis. Missouri also will
hold a primary March 7.
</P>
<P>
   But to rearrange his schedule for the debate, McCain said he has
canceled a rally Thursday evening on New York's Long Island. New
York's primary also is March 7, among the 13 contests scheduled for
that day.
</P>
<P>
   None looms as large as California, where McCain aides
acknowledge they trail Bush among Republicans by 10 to 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   The state offers the primary winner 162 delegates, more than 15
percent of the 1,034 delegates needed to win the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt about the absolute importance of
California,'' McCain said as he rode on his campaign bus from
Stockton to Fresno, part of a day in California's fertile Central
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will spend five of the next seven days in California,
taking time out for a quick trip to New York as well as stops in
New England and Ohio for a last pitch for votes there before March
7.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign will stop today at the University of Southern
California, where McCain will tape an edition of MSNBC's ``Hardball
with Chris Matthews.'' A similar appearance a few weeks back at
Clemson University was well-received. He also will appear tonight
on the ``Tonight Show with Jay Leno'' on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also will hold a rally in the Little Saigon neighborhood
of Los Angeles. The former POW during the Vietnam War ran into
trouble recently for using an ethnic slur against Asians to refer
to his North Vietnamese captors.
</P>
<P>
   Picking up the theme he laid out Monday, McCain said in
Bakersfield, ``We will not let Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson run
the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the GOP's alliance with the religious conservative
leaders has contributed to Republican defeats in the last two
presidential elections by forcing Republican nominees too far to
the right on social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have been critical of McCain. Robertson made strongly
worded anti-McCain telephone calls in Michigan before last week's
Republican primary, which McCain won.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks on Falwell and Robertson have two related goals _ to
push Bush into an ideological corner that would dissuade moderate
Republicans, independents and Democrats from supporting him and to
demonstrate that McCain is the more electable of the two men.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's outreach to independents and Democrats also sets up
the intriguing possibility that Bush could win the Republican vote,
and with it all of California's delegates, but that McCain could
wind up with more votes overall in the state's open primary.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to know at this point how likely that outcome is, but
McCain supporters already are using the possibility to suggest that
McCain's campaign could go on even if Bush wins the state's
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a split decision ... then that's going to have to
be a debate that takes place within the Republican Party. Do they
want someone who wins a majority or someone who only wins
Republican votes,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   California Secretary of State Bill Jones, a McCain supporter who
backed Bush until recently, said he would urge the Republican Party
to change its rules. ``The parties would be wise to be guided by
the results of the blanket primary, whatever their rules, for their
own good,'' Jones said.

   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ There's an interesting dilemma facing USC as it
leaves for the Bay Area today.
</P>
<P>
   Should the Trojans, who play No. 1-ranked Stanford on Thursday,
rest their starters if the game gets out of hand and try to save
their energy for Saturday's game at Cal?
</P>
<P>
   USC needs a sweep to keep its NCAA hopes alive but believes it
could remain on the bubble if it splits and finishes with an
overall record of 17-13.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem to make sense to give the starters a break if the
Stanford game is a blowout.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be smart,'' forward David Bluthenthal said. ``A lot
of coaches would do that. But that remains to be seen. If I was the
coach, that's what I would do.''
</P>
<P>
   USC's top four players _ Bluthenthal, Brian Scalabrine, Jeff
Trepagnier, Brandon Granville _ are all averaging at least 37.6
minutes per game. And the Trojans have admitted they often feel
less energetic on the second game of road trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, playing (37) minutes Thursday would take something
out of you on Saturday,'' Bluthenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   Added coach Henry Bibby: ``Right now, Stanford is the game.
Maybe we can sneak out a win.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Clancy ready: Forward Sam Clancy (broken right foot) has not
been officially cleared by doctors to play until Saturday but
intends to play against Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can go Thursday,'' Clancy said.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy began running offensive plays and shooting drills in
practice Monday and began one-on-one drills against freshman center
Luke Minor on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``His foot is ready to go,'' Bibby said. ``The doctors have
given him 100 percent (clearance) on Saturday. It's maybe 90
percent against Stanford. But it's Sam's call.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby said he envisions playing Clancy about 15-16 minutes per
game.
</P>
<P>
   __ Women's update: USC's women's basketball team (12-12, 7-7)
hosts Cal and Stanford at the Sports Arena this weekend. Stanford
is in first place, but the Trojans have defeated three teams
(Oregon, Arizona, UCLA) who were atop the standings at one point
this season.
</P>
<P>
   If USC wins its final four games, the Trojans could make the
NCAA Tournament. They also have a good chance of making the women's
National Invitation Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at a point in our development to where (the NIT)
wouldn't be a bad experience,'' USC women's basketball coach Chris
Gobrecht said. ``And it would represent an excellent turnaround
from 7-20 last season.
</P>
<P>
   If USC wins one more game, Gobrecht will enjoy the most
successful season in her three years as head coach.

<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. _ Gov. George W. Bush won a forceful victory over
Sen. John McCain in the Virginia primary on Tuesday, picking up a
large cache of delegates as well as a considerable morale boost
after his discouraging loss in Michigan a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates drew heavily from the same voter groups that
have supported them in earlier contests for the Republican
presidential nomination. Bush captured faithful Republican voters,
as he did in his victory in South Carolina 10 days ago,
particularly conservatives and those who call themselves members of
the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won the overwhelming support of independents and
Democrats. While those voters were responsible for the Arizona
senator's first-place finishes in Michigan and New Hampshire before
that, they accounted for a much smaller proportion of the
electorate here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The results also showed that the wave of publicity after
McCain's upset victory in Michigan and his fresh appeal that he was
``a proud Reagan conservative,'' were not sufficient to carry him
over the finish line. And McCain's blunt attacks Monday on leaders
of the religious right failed to rouse independents and Democrats,
although the senator argued that message will play better in
upcoming states with higher proportions of moderates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush on Tuesday night characterized his victory as a repudiation
of McCain's drive to paint him as a captive of the religious right.
``The voters of Virginia rejected the politics of pitting one
religion against another,'' Bush declared at a rally in Cincinnati.
``This campaign is winning and we're doing it the right way. We are
uniting our party without compromising principle.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters aboard his campaign bus in central
California, McCain said he called Bush to congratulate him on his
victory in Virginia. But he minimized the accomplishment,
suggesting that Bush had only regional appeal. ``It seems as if he
has a Southern strategy, doing well in Southern states,'' McCain
said. ``We'll look forward to Super Tuesday when we have a broad
section _ a cross-section of America _ voting all on that same
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he felt his speech against the Christian right on
Monday had damaged him with Virginia voters, he replied: ``No. We
were talking nationally, not to Virginia.''
</P>
<P>
   With 99 percent of the votes counted in Virginia, Bush had 53
percent, McCain had 44 percent and Alan Keyes had 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Bush and McCain were no where near Virginia as the
votes were being counted underscored how the looming jumble of
contests next Tuesday overshadowed the voting. The election on
March 7 is tantamount to a national primary, with Republicans going
to the polls in California, New York, Ohio, Georgia, Missouri and
seven other states. As a result, the contenders have raced from one
coast to the other _ and in between.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not stumped in Virginia since Friday night, when he
spoke in Richmond at a party dinner. McCain rushed out of the state
early Monday afternoon after condemning Pat Robertson and the Rev.
Jerry Falwell, two leaders of the religious right, in a speech in
Virginia Beach. On Tuesday, as he bounced in California from
Stockton to Fresno to Bakersfield, McCain was clearly focused on
next Tuesday. ``California is a critical state,'' he said. ``And I
need to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Virginia was the largest delegate prize of the day,
Washington state also held a primary on Tuesday. Both candidates
spent as much time in recent days competing there as in Virginia.
The McCain campaign viewed that state _ with a history of rewarding
insurgents _ as more hospitable to their candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Voters also went to caucuses on Tuesday in North Dakota, which
has only 19 delegates. There was also a Democratic primary in
Washington state, where no delegates were at stake. Bill Bradley
campaigned vigorously there, struggling for a symbolic victory as a
first step in catching Vice President Al Gore. By Tuesday night,
definitive results in Washington and North Dakota had not been
tallied.
</P>
<P>
   In this roller-coaster of a primary season, the outcome in
Virginia was a substantial victory for Bush because by capturing
all of Virginia's 56 delegates to the national convention (1,034
are needed for the nomination), he surpassed McCain in the total
delegate tally. The state has the 10th largest share of delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was well organized in this state, relying on the energetic
support of the state's most prominent elected Republicans,
particularly Gov. James S. Gilmore III and Sen. John W. Warner, and
vastly outspending McCain. McCain had boasted that he would beat
the ``Gilmore-Warner machine'' just as he had topped Gov. John M.
Engler's organization in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain just played it wrong in attacking the Gilmore-Warner
machine in Virginia,'' said Mark J. Rozell, a professor of politics
at Catholic University and an expert on Virginia politics. ``He
named probably the two most popular figures in Virginia politics.
And by making several campaign stops in Virginia, McCain raised the
expectations for his candidacy and failed badly. It gives momentum
to George W. Bush going in to Super Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as they played down the significance of the outcome on
Tuesday, McCain's aides had significantly stepped up his budget for
the state in recent days after the senator's victory in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The McCain folks were working very hard; they bought our whole
voter file,'' said Ed Matricardi, executive director of the
Republican Party of Virginia. ``They ran a full-fledged campaign
here. The Bush people did too.'' Told that the McCain operation
said it was never particularly serious about Virginia, Matricardi
said, ``How can you advertise heavily in the most expensive
television market _ Northern Virginia _ and say you didn't campaign
here?''

</P>
<P>
   While McCain's supporters dismissed Bush as simply winning
another Southern state, this state is more diverse than South
Carolina, from the tobacco country in the South to the coal country
in the West to the Washington suburbs to the North.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you know that the western tip of Virginia is further west
than Detroit?'' Matricardi said on Tuesday as he pointed to a
brightly-colored map on the wall of his office. But although this
state is more diverse than South Carolina, it is significantly more
conservative than Michigan _ and that helps explain why Bush won.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's continued difficulty in winning significant support
from loyal Republicans may also be a promising sign for Bush as the
contests turn largely to states where only Republicans can vote.
More than six in 10 of the voters on Tuesday described themselves
as Republicans and they overwhelmingly backed Bush, according to a
survey of voters leaving the polls.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly three in 10 said they considered themselves
independents _ and they just as overwhelmingly backed McCain. Less
than one in 10 voters described themselves as Democrats, and they
overwhelmingly backed McCain. Bush was far more successful here
than in Michigan because voters in Virginia are more conservative.
Nearly six in 10 of voters here described themselves as
conservatives, compared to just over four in 10 in Michigan. The
conservative voters in Virginia backed Bush over McCain by a margin
of more than two to one.
</P>
<P>
   But moderates, who accounted for about three in 10 of the voters
on Tuesday, backed McCain over Bush by nearly the same margin.
Liberals, who made up one in 10 of the electorate, overwhelmingly
backed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of how the Republican rivalry has deepened the
divide between two very different wings of the party, Republicans
who voted Tuesday were split over McCain's ideological stripes.
Half said he is not conservative enough; half said he is
conservative by the right amount.
</P>
<P>
   People who describe themselves as religious conservatives were
less crucial to Bush's victory here than in South Carolina. Two in
10 Virginia voters said they were part of the religious right
movement; of those,nearly eight in 10 voted for Bush. In South
Carolina, more than threein 10 voters said they were part of the
religious right; nearly seven in 10 supported Bush.
</P>
<P>
   While the closing days of the campaign here were dominated by
bitter exchanges between the Bush and McCain camps over the
Christian right and over which candidate is the true conservative,
that may not have had much influence on the outcome because fewer
than one in 10 voters left their decision until Tuesday. Those who
did decide backed Bush overwhelmingly.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign moved aggressively to tap into hostility from
tobacco farmers about McCain's support for higher cigarette taxes
and from voters in Northern Virginia who were distressed by his
advocacy for more flights _ and more noise _ at Reagan National
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's organization delivered automated telephone calls to
10,000 residents of Northern Virginia, accusing McCain of pressing
for ``48 additional noisy flights.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, there had only been one presidential primary in
Virginia, and that was in 1988. Bush's father, George Bush,
defeated Bob Dole and Pat Robertson in that primary. Since then,
the state has picked its convention delegates through caucuses.

EDITORIAL: CHILDREN WITH GUNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, March 1:
</P>
<P>
   Americans should be outraged that any 6-year-old could get a gun
and fire it to kill another 6-year-old in their first-grade
classroom. The shooting Tuesday at Buell Elementary School, near
Flint, Mich., is the latest episode of gun violence in schools.
Investigators say there might have been a playground quarrel
between the two children the day before. But sorting out intent may
be difficult, if not irrelevant. The responsibility for the death
has to lie with the adults who allowed a first-grader to get access
to a gun. It also lies with lawmakers in Washington who have
blocked efforts to protect children from this kind of senseless
death.
</P>
<P>
   The massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., less
than a year ago shamed Congress into considering stronger gun
control laws. But the measure that emerged from the Senate, and is
now stalled in a conference committee, was a pale version of
President Clinton's proposals. Among other defects, it does not
include a child-access-prevention provision. Seventeen states have
laws that make gun owners criminally liable when they allow a child
access to a weapon that causes injury. Those laws have reduced
accidental shootings. But federal legislation is needed to make
this a national standard.
</P>
<P>
   Child-safety locks are an inexpensive, easy reform. Many
handguns have so little trigger resistance that they can be fired
by a 3-year-old. Yet Congress has done nothing about this problem
yet, and the safety-lock provision languishing in the conference
committee would not require that the devices meet minimal technical
standards to ensure that they can effectively stop accidental
firings by children.
</P>
<P>
   On other fronts, Congress has shown scant interest in aiding the
development of ``smart gun'' technology that would prevent the
unauthorized use of weapons. It has also failed to limit sales to
individuals to one gun a month.
</P>
<P>
   After the shootings at Columbine and at other schools around the
country, the gun lobby has typically tried to divert attention from
guns to issues like violence in movies and other social factors.
But it is impossible, even for the gun lobby, to escape the clear
meaning of Tuesday's school killing. It happened because a very
young child was able to obtain and fire a loaded weapon.

WHAT TODDLERS NEED: GRAYING BOOMERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By RICHARD ROTHSTEIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are two unrelated social problems that can solve each
other. Too few poor children in their prekindergarten years have
the kinds of literacy experiences that lead to later academic
achievement. Simultaneously, healthier retirements leave many aging
Americans craving socially useful roles.
</P>
<P>
   Why not match them, giving retirees opportunities to read to
young children?
</P>
<P>
   There is a stubborn achievement gap between white and minority
students, and by the time they enter school much of the damage has
already been done. At least half the test score difference between
black and white 12th graders is attributable to what occurs before
they enter first grade.
</P>
<P>
   All 3- and 4-year-olds need intellectually stimulating
experiences. They should be read to, talked to, told stories and
given play opportunities that include using paper and crayons,
puzzles, clay, blocks and other objects to manipulate. Students who
succeed usually had the benefit of regular lap reading as toddlers,
and learned to pretend-read a variety of word and picture books.
</P>
<P>
   With full employment and welfare reform moving mothers into
jobs, it might seem that poor children will now get these
experiences in formal preschools. Yet a recent survey by Dr. Bruce
Fuller of the University of California and Dr. Sharon Kagan of Yale
finds that the quality of day care for low-income children is
remarkably poor.
</P>
<P>
   At day care settings that serve welfare-to-work mothers in
California, Connecticut and Florida, Fuller and Kagan recorded
children's activity at 40 points during a three-hour observation.
In California, a given child was being read to on an average of
less than one of those 40 occasions. In Connecticut, it was about
two, and in Florida about one and a half. In contrast, children
were watching television or wandering aimlessly in 6 of these
``snapshots'' in California and Connecticut, and in nearly 13 in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Against that kind of backdrop, the first baby boomers turn 55
next year. Already, life spans have so lengthened, and retirement
ages so declined, that only 20 percent of Americans 55 and over
still work. Those who do not are mostly healthy and receiving
benefits from Social Security or private pensions, or both. With
time on their hands, many want more useful roles. The affluent ones
moving to Arizona or Florida are exceptions; most reside not far
from the very communities where needy preschoolers could use
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as Marc Freedman notes in his book ``Prime Time'' (Public
Affairs, 1999), while we ``face a profound shortage of human beings
to tend the social fabric, we overlook the presence of untapped
human resources in the older population.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Freedman helped found the Experience Corps, a project
sponsored by the government's Corp. for National Service, which is
directed by former Senator Harris Wofford of Pennsylvania. The
fledgling project (www.experiencecorps.org) has placed 800
volunteer retirees in 70 schools around the country. They read to
and with children, talk to and tutor them. The volunteers get
stipends of about $150 a month, and commit to 15-hour-a-week
schedules. Schools often set aside rooms where they can gather,
exchange experiences, consult with teachers and even meet with
parents. The project relies on foundation grants and some
discretionary financing that Wofford assembles from other federal
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Experience Corps is now beginning to move into preschools.
Literacy training can do the most good there, and most retirees
already have the required grandparenting and lap reading skills.
</P>
<P>
   At a demonstration project in the heart of Kansas City's most
impoverished African-American community, Juanita Carter, 75,
volunteers in a YMCA-operated preschool. Retired from her job
cleaning university classrooms, she lives on Social Security and a
small pension.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the Experience Corps,'' Carter said, ``and as long as I
can stay healthy, I'm going to stay here,'' reading to 3- and
4-year-olds, helping them practice writing letters and numbers,
comforting them when they cry, meeting them when they get off a bus
in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Another Kansas City volunteer, Laura White, is 90, retired from
restaurant and housecleaning work. With eyesight failing, she now
mostly ``reads'' books with big pictures, asking children to
identify the objects. This not only benefits the children, ``it
keeps me alert,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   ``America,'' Freedman noted, ``now possesses not only the
largest and fastest-growing population of older adults in our
history, but the healthiest, most vigorous and best educated.''
</P>
<P>
   Working generations too frequently cannot provide the
intellectual stimulation for infants and toddlers that promotes
success in school. Matching retirees (in need of purpose) with
preschoolers (in need of storytelling) is like elementary algebra:
multiplying two negative trends brings a positive result.

 FAMILY ILLNESS PUT GOLF IN PERSPECTIVE FOR
CLARK DENNIS (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By JIMMY
BURCH c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Clark Dennis has yet to face his first
knee-knocking par putt of the professional golf season. But the
Fort Worth resident already has recorded the biggest save of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis, 34, will make his belated debut this week on the Buy.com
Tour because he and his wife, Vickie, have been playing since Feb.
4 for much larger stakes than any tournament purse. That's when
Vickie, one day after the birth of the couple's third child, quit
breathing and went into a seizure while awaiting clearance to be
dismissed from Harris Methodist Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   For someone who had undergone a routine delivery the previous
day, the post-birth bout with toxemia _ a rare blood disorder that
can affect mothers and newborns _ was unexpected and dangerous.
Dennis, who immediately summoned a nurse after Vickie went into
convulsions, learned as much from medical personnel after his
wife's condition stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wasn't in the room when she had the seizure, she would
have died,'' Dennis said. ``That puts everything in perspective. It
still gives me chills to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those chills returned a few days later, when Vickie Dennis
flipped on the bedroom light and began pointing at her head. She
couldn't talk, but her husband got the message. Within minutes,
they were at the emergency room. Vickie Dennis' blood pressure had
soared to 244/122, well above the norm of 120/80.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the stroke range. I was seeing stars and had a
horrible migraine headache,'' she said. ``It was surreal.''
</P>
<P>
   It was toxemia, back for another visit. At least, that's what a
battery of tests concluded after countless other medical
explanations were ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   Mercifully, the toxemia never affected the couple's newborn,
Phillip Michael Dennis. During each episode, Vickie spent roughly
48 hours in an unconscious state. She has no memory of the delivery
and is sketchy on details from her on-again, off-again hospital
stay that covered two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers the morning she woke to the sound of sobbing
beside her bed. It was Clark, who had kept an all-night vigil. She
also recalls the flowers she received from PGA Tour commissioner
Tim Finchem. And the last conversation the couple shared before the
toxemia symptoms arose.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to Clark break an appointment with his personal
trainer, she lobbied for him to reconsider. The delivery, she
pointed out, had been routine. Mother and child were resting
comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   Clark Dennis never budged.
</P>
<P>
   ``This all started 10 minutes after that conversation,'' Vickie
Dennis said. ``I couldn't have called the nurse. I couldn't have
yelled for help. For once, I'm glad he didn't listen to me.''
</P>
<P>
   So is her husband, who has not played a full round of golf since
failing to keep his PGA Tour card during the November qualifying
school. His practice schedule, understandably, has been almost
nonexistent for the past month. Admittedly, Dennis has few
expectations heading into tomorrow's opening round of the
Mississippi Gulf Coast Classic in Gulfport, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   But he has a new resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know nothing on the golf course can scare me the way I've
been scared,'' Dennis said. ``If I catch a bad break or a bad lie,
I definitely will think, `Big deal.' It won't bother me. That's a
perspective I've never had before.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Dennis hopes a bolder approach to adversity on the
golf course will result in lower scores and a return to the PGA
Tour. This week, he's simply hoping to assess what areas of his
game need the most work. He expects his mind to wander back home,
to Vickie and his three sons, who will be joined by Vickie's
mother, Genoveva Vargas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I could care less about golf,'' Dennis said. ``I
feel blessed the Lord had me in that room when Vickie had her
seizure. I love her and I just want to take care of her. As long as
she gets better, that's all I'm concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a man who truly understands that saving a par pales
greatly in comparison to saving a life.

 SELIG'S RULING HELPS BASEBALL AND
STRAWBERRY (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By GIL
LeBRETON c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ For once, somebody told Darryl Strawberry
no.
</P>
<P>
   We must applaud baseball commissioner Bud Selig for that. For
all too long, there was a helping hand, a check-writing
Steinbrenner and an adoring New York public, ready to forgive and
forget.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Strawberry was sending baseball missiles long into
the night, there seemed to be fans and teammates willing to see
nothing but the home run. If he were a .240 hitter with average
power totals, Strawberry would have been excised from baseball's
consciousness long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, judging from his words Monday, even Selig himself,
despite the one-year suspension he handed down, was ready to buy
into the sob story and give Strawberry a life vest to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meeting I had with Darryl and his wife, Charisse, was an
emotional experience for all of us,'' the commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
   Pardon me, but I thought ``Kenesaw Mountain'' Selig just got a
big raise not to be so emotional about baseball-type things. The
owners voted to give him the big belt buckle and commissioned him
to step on toes.
</P>
<P>
   But consider this quote: ``I had no doubt that his remorse and
sorrow were genuine, and I worried about the effect my decision
would have on his health and the welfare of his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig said that. And there must be players union negotiators
chortling aloud at this very minute.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a year from now, when baseball's labor well-being is
again up for negotiation, and Selig says, ``I had no doubt that the
players' pleas of poverty and requests for personalized jet skis
were genuine, and I worried about the effect my decision would have
on their 12,000-square-foot mansions and the welfare of their golf
games.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners don't need that. They need a Maximum Bud. (Insert
gavel sound here). Next case, please.
</P>
<P>
   For the life of me, I can't understand when in his scarred
baseball career, Darryl Strawberry lapsed from home-run hitter to
pinstriped Mother Teresa. Teammates babble dotingly about the guy.
Yankees owner George Steinbrenner had him last season for only one
month, yet reportedly bailed him out and paid Strawberry's full,
$2.5-million salary.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Strawberry has been under a dark cloud. He was
diagnosed with colon cancer in 1998, and doctors removed a 16-inch
portion of his intestine. And what rotten luck _ he got picked up
in a bad neighborhood in Tampa, Fla., last April, cruising for
hookers and with drugs in his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean Strawberry has an excuse. He has an
illness.
</P>
<P>
   And if a full year in 1999 under baseball's structured
environment, knowing he was going to be regularly tested for drugs,
did not sober up Darryl Strawberry, why should anyone think that
this season was going to be any better?
</P>
<P>
   Let me suggest that there are far more touching sob stories to
be heard every week at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. But we
don't see Steinbrenner offering them contracts.
</P>
<P>
   We can only imagine Strawberry's mindset. Even as a drug addict,
even as someone who had repeatedly let his fans down, he could
still hit the home runs and hear the cheers. What incentive was
there to clean up?
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's first wife, lest we forget, accused him of beating
her and breaking her nose, while also threatening her with a
.25-caliber handgun. Strawberry was also arrested once for
allegedly striking his then-fiancee Charisse. She declined to press
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry doesn't need baseball. He needs help.
</P>
<P>
   And Maximum Bud Selig, thank goodness, just gave Strawberry 12
free months to look for help.
</P>
<P>
   Until some judge or arbitrator tells us otherwise, Selig
deserves our applause. A strong commissioner should give baseball
fans hope. For too long, baseball has had this mindset that
strength in commissioner's office meant sitting in short sleeves at
the World Series and occasionally telling Pete Rose no.
</P>
<P>
   There are more weighty issues to come, of course, like telling
Jerry Colangelo that he has no choice and the Arizona Diamondbacks
must move to the American League.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, so good. Strawberry deserved a hard sentence.
</P>
<P>
   And baseball needs a hard hand.

TAKING THE MUSIC TO THE STREET  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 5) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALVADOR, Brazil _ The symbol of the pre-Lenten carnival in the
state of Bahia _ and, in many ways, the symbol of Brazilian popular
music today _ is the trio eletrico, a hulking vehicle loaded down
with massive speakers. Musicians play on the top level and carnival
celebrants jump around the vehicle as it cuts through the throngs.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the most lavish ones _ like those used by the pop singers
Ivete Sangalo and Netinho _ are full bars, televisions, lounges.
This year, one of them is reported to have a swimming pool on top.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival in Salvador, the capital of Bahia, is purely a street
carnival, different from the Folies Bergeres-like televised
festivities that take place in Rio de Janeiro. The music played on
top of the trio eletrico _ it's usually the popular new Brazilian
samba-reggae or axe music _ has a direct relationship to the street
and takes part in a kind of natural selection: each year carnival
starts with dozens of songs written specifically for the
festivities, and by the end of the week that repertory has been
narrowed to a handful.
</P>
<P>
   The trio eletrico is the medium, and the street decides. It is a
powerful, mythical machine, memorialized in countless songs. And it
began with two musically inclined inventors, a 1929 four-door Ford
with two conical speakers and a few homemade electric cavaquinhos,
a four-stringed, ukelele-like instrument.
</P>
<P>
   Carnaval 2000 in Bahia, which started on Friday and runs through
Wednesday, is a special one: it not only marks the 500th
anniversary of the founding of Brazil but is also the 50th
anniversary of the trio eletrico. Dodo and Osmar, the two inventors
of the trio eletrico, will be honored with a special trio manned by
Moraes Moreira, one of Brazil's favorite musicians and songwriters
and himself an important part of the story of the trio's
development.
</P>
<P>
   A new book, ``50 Anos do Trio Eletrico,'' by Fred Goes, recounts
the story of the trio and its meaning in carnival culture.
</P>
<P>
   Osmar's son Armando Macedo, known professionally as Armandinho
and now in his late 40s, says the story of the trio eletrico really
began in 1942. While working as a radio technician, Dodo ordered
electrical parts from the Sears, Roebuck catalog and managed to
electrify a hollow-body cavaquinho. He was intrigued after having
seen the classical violinist Benedito Chaves, who had performed in
Bahia with an electrified violin the previous year. But the
feedback from an electric cavaquinho _ even with flannel cloth
stuffed inside _ was so unbearable that he decided to create a
solid-body instrument.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dodo and Osmar went to a music shop called Primavera, which is
still here in Salvador,'' Armandinho recounted in an interview last
week, ``and asked for two cavaquinhos of medium quality. Right
there in the shop, they smashed the bodies of the guitars; they
just wanted the necks.'' They connected the neck to slabs of thick,
compact wood cut from a table, affixed four strings and two
electric pickups to them _ with a magnetized bridge on top of the
pickup, so the electrical currents from electric wires in the
street wouldn't interfere with the guitar's own electric signals.
</P>
<P>
   The result was what they called the pau eletrico, or electric
stick. They even figured out how to amplify it where there was no
electricity, by connecting the instrument to car batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Les Paul, the American guitarist, is usually credited with
inventing the solid-body electric guitar in 1941. But in some way,
Dodo and Osmar _ who are never mentioned in histories of the
electric guitar _ may have had a relationship to Paul similar to
the one the early Brazilian aviator Alberto Santos-Dumont had to
the Wright brothers. In both cases, the North Americans receive the
official credit, but there is a parallel history of South American
ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
   Dodo and Osmar played these instruments semiprofessionally until
1950, when, 20 days before carnival, the 150-musician Vassourinha
orchestra from the northeastern Brazilian state of Pernambuco
visited here. Its music inspired Dodo and Osmar to take up the
bright, march-rhythm Pernambucan music called the frevo.
</P>
<P>
   Frevos were already popular in Bahia, but were not a major part
of carnival. Dodo and Osmar changed that irrevocably the first time
they ventured out in their four-door Ford as the Dupla Eletrica
(Electric Duo), with two loudspeakers on the front of the car and a
few drummers marching around it. They wanted to replicate the force
of a huge orchestra with their electric instruments, and they had
hit upon the perfect music for a street parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play sambas, people dance in one place,'' Armandinho
said. ``With frevos, they have to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, the second year Dodo and Osmar took a moving vehicle
out into the carnaval parade, a third guitarist was added in the
car. It was now a trio eletrico and was such a success that the
name quickly became a generic phrase: other bands popped up, riding
in cars through the streets and calling themselves trios eletricos,
and soon the trio eletrico denoted the vehicle, not the band.
</P>
<P>
   Before long there were dozens of trios (sometimes with more or
less than three members). They were assuming more and more
beautiful shapes and designs; the singer Caetano Veloso remembers
one designed as a giant alligator with rows of loudspeakers in its
mouth disguised not as teeth, but as flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Another, sponsored by a soft-drink company and designed by
Osmar, was a horizontal bottle with neon lights mimicking the
decanting of its contents. In 1971, when Veloso returned to Brazil
after a year and a half in London as a political exile, he was
honored with a special trio called the Caetanave, or Caetano Rocket
_ a shiny silver vehicle with fins, a high platform for the
guitarists and lower platforms for the drummers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In last year's carnival, a replica of the Caetanave was
commissioned by the popular musician Carlinhos Brown and became one
of the high points of the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The trios were playing anything and everything popular _
Paganini, Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, Ravel's ``Bolero,'' the
Catholic hymn ``Senhor do Bonfim,'' the Beatles' ``I Want to Hold
Your Hand'' _ all frevo-ized. In 1969, Veloso's song ``Atras do
Trio Eletrico'' (``Behind the Trio Eletrico'') became a nationwide
hit, and it was only then that trios eletricos became a profitable
symbol of Bahia.
</P>
<P>
   By this time they had passed out of Dodo and Osmar's hands;
starting in the 1960s, the entrepreneur Orlando Campos developed
the trios eletricos into a business. Now they work almost like
sports teams, with each one owned privately and charging high
prices _ up to $300 this year _ for the privilege of wearing the
trio's official shirt and dancing around the trio.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s, Bahian music was changing, and the trios changed
along with it. In 1975 Moreira, who had just left the popular band
Os Novos Baianos, brought some radical modifications to the
tradition. He was the first to sing atop a trio _ though he
remembers that the first year it was a complete technical failure.
And he started to write an entire catalog of songs meant for that
purpose. He also incorporated afoxe rhythms _ derived from the
Yoruban heritage of this heavily African-influenced city _ into the
music and brought the drums onto the same platform as the other
instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Inasmuch as Moreira was a rock musician, his form of rock was
heavily influenced by the sound of the trio eletrico. So it was
only natural that the trio eletrico would be equally influenced by
rock when Moreira got involved with it.
</P>
<P>
   Armandinho remembers buying distortion and phase-shifting pedals
for his small guitarra Baiana and working a strain of Jimi
Hendrix's ``Bold as Love'' into the theme song of his trio in the
early 1970s. ``When Dodo saw the pedals the first time,''
Armandinho remembered, ``he said: `I can't believe I worked so hard
to take all the distortion out of the sound, and now you're putting
it back in. It's either me or these pedals.' And he left, and
waited for me to get rid of the pedals before he got on the truck
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The sound system had progressed from old-fashioned loudspeakers
to sophisticated amplifiers; it was an imitation of a rock band's
sound.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the thickening commerce around the trios since then has not
dampened their popular power or their suggestiveness. They can be
whatever the crowd is ready for. Carlinhos Brown has worked hard to
keep a spirit of creativity, surprise and renovation in the
procession of the trios; he owns the trio for the band Timbalada,
which last year was festooned with an amazing mixture of ancient
and futuristic totems (not to mention seminude dancing women).
</P>
<P>
   This year the singer Daniela Mercury has turntablists scratching
and mixing on her trio _ a first. The Brazilian-American musician
Arto Lindsay played noise-rock guitar on top of a trio during last
year's carnival; one of his dreams is to create a trio composed of
two smaller trucks that would move together, one bearing treble
speakers, the other bearing bass, for a strange, different sonic
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas Santtana, an important member of the next wave of young
innovators in Brazilian music, sees a natural connection between
the pipoca (or popcorn, the term for the jumping, exploding crowds
around the trio) of carnival and the audience at Berlin's Love
Parade, a procession that is more like a mobile techno-music rave.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trio is a rootsy thing, but it's not old, in the folkloric
sense,'' Santtana said. ``It's pop. And when I listened to the
techno music that they play in the Love Parade, I recognized many
things I heard when I was a kid in Bahia. I recognized the sub-bass
of the trios, and the high-hats _ things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   His debut record, to be released in two weeks in Brazil, is
called ``Eletrobendodo'' _ an invented word that refers to the trio
eletrico, the musician Jorge Ben and Dodo.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to capture the ecstasy of the trio experience in any
still medium. For such a valued part of a carnival culture, the
trios were scarcely photographed before the 1970s; aside from the
original car and the original paus eletricos, which remain in the
Macedo family's possession, the history is largely oral. That might
be a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's not very photogenic, not very good for
television,'' says Caetano Veloso, ``carnival in Bahia has been
protected from becoming artificialized.''

 &HT;    Gore, Bradley move on to California, Super Tuesday
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ While the nonbinding Washington state primary was
taking place Tuesday, former Sen. Bill Bradley and Vice President
Al Gore were in California, pointing toward next Tuesday's big
primary there.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley campaigned in both Northern and Southern California
after winding up six days of campaigning in Washington state, where
he hoped to regain some momentum with a victory in the ``beauty
contest'' with no delegates at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the outcome there, Bradley said he would fight
until the Super Tuesday primaries March 7.
</P>
<P>
   In a TV interview with KTVU, Bradley said, ``This race has just
begun. March 7 is the takeoff time for this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   To underscore that point, Bradley's campaign said Tuesday that
the candidate has purchased five minutes of television time on CBS
to air an unusual political ad Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign said the ad, airing at 10:54 p.m. EST, will
``reaffirm Bill Bradley's role as a reformer'' and make ``a
compelling case for his candidacy.''
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent effort to distinguish himself from Sen. John
McCain (R-Ariz.), who has also seized the reform mantle, the ad
``will affirm (Bradley's) position as the only presidential
candidate who represents reform with a consistent dedication to
core Democratic principles.''
</P>
<P>
   All polls in California show a one-sided contest, with Gore far
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president spoke at a Hispanic event and attended two
fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   He stressed health care and education issues and also mentioned
the battle against Proposition 187, the voter-approved and
court-rejected California ballot measure that attempted to prevent
the state from providing public services to illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   He also told elementary school students in Cudahy, where 90
percent of the residents are Latino, that Tuesday's fatal shooting
of a Michigan first-grader by a classmate showed the importance of
gun controls, especially child safety trigger locks.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley claimed he was the strongest presidential candidate
on gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning the day at San Francisco General Hospital, Bradley
argued that his gun control proposals are stronger and more
comprehensive than Gore's. Bradley has proposed requiring all hand
gun owners to be licensed and all guns to be registered.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Bradley addressed about 500 students at UCLA. ``I need
you,'' he told them. ``I need your idealism and your energy.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not mention Gore by name, but he called the primary
contest a ``choice between a Democratic Party that protects the
established interests and those who believe the Democratic Party
should fulfill its historic mission of defending old ideals against
complacency, indifference and selfishness.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley plans to speak this morning at a Los Angeles clinic to
promote his health care plan before spending the majority of the
day preparing for a 90-minute debate tonight in Los Angeles. The
debate between the two Democrats airs live on CNN at 9 p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign said that after the debate, the candidate
would be returning to New York, where some of his top supporters
have sharply questioned his decision to spend almost an entire week
focusing on Washington state.

THE MAN WHO BREATHED LIFE INTO `PORGY AND BESS'
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: S.C., N.Y.)  (FOR RELEASE: Sunday, March 5) 
 (jw) 
 David Schiff is a composer on the faculty of Reed College in
Portland, Ore. 
By DAVID SCHIFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Porgy and Bess'' comes to the New York City Opera on Tuesday
evening, so it is a good time to celebrate the man largely
responsible for the opera's resilience: DuBose Heyward, the author
of the 1925 novel ``Porgy.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course there are those fabulous Gershwin tunes, but no other
Gershwin show has proved revivable, and in no other Gershwin show
do the songs embody dramatic characters, even when sung out of
context or played without the lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to Miles Davis play ``Gone, Gone, Gone,'' and you are
still in Catfish Row, mourning for Jake Robbins. Heyward invented
those characters, and their provocative mixture of good and evil,
poverty and power makes the opera endlessly fascinating and has
allowed it to survive in many forms, from folk opera to musical
comedy to movie musical (with dubbed voices) and even its current,
but not necessarily final, form, grand opera.
</P>
<P>
   Heyward was born in Charleston, S.C., in 1885. His father died
when he was young, and his mother, a published poet, brought him up
in genteel poverty made worse by bouts of polio and pleurisy. His
mother had taken an interest in the Gullah dialect spoken by
Charleston's blacks. She passed this interest to her son, who (as
he wrote in the introduction to the play ``Porgy,'' which his wife,
Dorothy Heyward, helped adapt from the novel) developed a romantic
image of the ``mystery and movement of Negro life,'' the powerful
motion of the stevedores and the emotional force of spirituals,
which produced ``a contraction of the solar plexus and lachrymal
glands that he was powerless to control.''
</P>
<P>
   After developing enough of a reputation as a poet to be invited
to the MacDowell Colony, Heyward began work on a novel inspired by
a notice in The Charleston News and Courier about Samuel Smalls, a
crippled beggar who had tried to shoot his lover. Smalls was a
well-known figure on Charleston's streets, remembered mainly for
the goat that pulled his cart through town. Heyward's surprising
reaction to the news hints at the complex way he viewed the
characters in ``Porgy and Bess'': ``Just think of that old wreck
having enough manhood to do a thing like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Heyward turned Smalls into Porgy and surrounded him with other
characters he had observed in Charleston: Crown, the muscular
stevedore; Bess, Crown's abused lover; Sportin' Life, the mulatto
purveyor of ``happy dust''; and the inhabitants of the slum known
as Catfish Row. Here were all the ingredients for a best-selling
novel and then a hit play: sex, violence, religion, love both
requited and betrayed, an exotic setting.
</P>
<P>
   Its racial theme resonated with other novels and plays of the
era, like Carl Van Vechten's ``Nigger Heaven,'' Eugene O'Neill's
``Emperor Jones'' and Paul Green's ``In Abraham's Bosom.'' The
black author Zora Neale Hurston called these white authors
Negrotarians, not entirely a term of abuse. The historian David
Levering Lewis writes that soon after its Broadway opening (in a
segregated theater), ``Porgy'' became ``Harlem's play'' and
``Harlemites knew the lines of the play almost as well as the
understudies did.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics _ mostly, but not all, white _ hailed Heyward's novel
for its realism, probably the last word that would spring to mind
for readers today, for whom the book will seem condescending in its
romantic idealization of Charleston's poorest blacks. But Heyward's
characters are more complex and mysterious than they first appear.
Porgy is a sage, a saint, a trickster, an inveterate gambler,
eventually a murderer. He is an idealized ``good'' man who, like
the stereotypical Good Negro, is good only at the cost of his
manhood. In the novel he is of an indeterminate age, but he briefly
regains his youth when Bess moves into his room, only to shrivel
back into old age when she abandons him.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bess, Crown and Sportin' Life form a diabolical trinity of
mythical and subversive powers. Metaphorically speaking they are
the blues counterweight to the spirituals sung by the ``God-fearin'
ladies.'' Crown and Sportin' Life, in their very different ways,
appeal to the audience despite their evil deeds. Viewed as an
emblem of rebellion, courage and sexual power, Crown prefigures the
black superstars and super-athletes to come, while Sportin' Life
(dope pusher, pimp and God-denying Voltaire all in one) is the
entertainer, demanding the likes of a Cab Calloway or a Sammy Davis
Jr. to fill his tap shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Bess appears surprisingly late in the novel, emerging out of the
shadows like a visitor from the dark side, which is the way Catfish
Row views her. Although her portrayal seems sketchy in the novel,
her finest operatic moment, ``I Loves You Porgy,'' is all there:
``Oh, fuh Gawd sake, Porgy, don't let dat man come an' handle me!
Ef yuh is willin' tuh keep me, den lemme stay. Ef he jus' don't put
dem ho han' on me, I kin be good, I kin 'member, I kin be happy.''
(Heyward's Gullah is easier to sing than to read.)
</P>
<P>
   In the play, Bess' character is filled out to show her strength
and independence, as she leads the ``shout'' to fill the burial
collection plate (transformed operatically into ``Oh, the Train Is
in the Station''), and in her attempts to resist Crown (turned
almost verbatim into ``What You Want wid Bess?''). These changes
only confirm the essence Bess shares with Crown and Sportin' Life,
a fierce independence of spirit which undermines the servile piety
that is the community norm.
</P>
<P>
   Porgy, who seems at times like a type of Christ, at times like
Adam before and after the Fall, is torn between ``doctor Jesus''
and his ``sometime thing'' Princess of Darkness, but it is no
contest. For the play, Dorothy Heyward created a new upbeat ending,
with Porgy following Bess to the promised land of Upper New York.
The secular, urban North is the new Jerusalem, even though it will
be filled with as many Sportin' Lifes and Crowns as Serenas and
Marias. Gershwin set this ending to ``Oh Lord, I'm on My Way,'' a
pseudospiritual with a disturbingly Broadway razzle-dazzle that
mirrors the play's inverted religiosity perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   Heyward was not a political radical, and by today's standards
his description of blacks as ``primitives'' seems racist, but
compared with the rabidly anti-black message of the film ``The
Birth of a Nation,'' which appeared in 1916, ``Porgy'' seemed
progressive; its view of blacks as separate but equal in their
humanity was an improvement on D.W. Griffith's movie, which
portrayed them as animals.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the novel's denouement, retained in the play and opera,
seems to express racial fears. Porgy murders Crown and proclaims:
``Bess, you got a man. You got Porgy!'' This transplant of sexual
potency proves futile, because Bess leaves Porgy anyway, and the
murder of a strong ``bad'' black man by a crippled ``good'' one
feels like a primitive white fantasy about black sexual power.
</P>
<P>
   Heyward and Gershwin seemed uneasy with this crucial turn in the
plot. In the novel the murder happens between paragraphs and is not
described; in the opera, Gershwin merely transplanted noisy music
from the fight scene in Act I, leaving to the director the
difficult task of making the struggle convincing.
</P>
<P>
   Turning the novel into a play moved the characters farther away
from stereotypes to complex human figures. But the experience of
staging the play profoundly altered Heyward's view of blacks. In
his preface to the published script of the play, Heyward praised
the black cast, many of them drawn from all-black musicals like
Eubie Blake's ``Shuffle Along'' and James P. Johnson's ``Runnin'
Wild,'' as collaborators who contributed important ``bits,'' and
noted that many of them came from theatrical families going back
several generations: anything but primitive.
</P>
<P>
   Already the black performers of ``Porgy'' were transforming the
show, a process that has continued to the present.
</P>
<P>
   As Hollis Alpert wrote in his indispensable study ``The Life and
Times of Porgy and Bess,'' Heyward now ``foresaw Negroes breaking
down the bastions traditionally reserved for whites.'' His next
novel, ``Mamba's Daughters,'' published in 1929, imagines an
all-black opera, with music that would be ``primitive _
sophisticated _ neither? _ both?'' performed on the stage of the
Metropolitan Opera, ending with the singing of James Weldon
Johnson's anthem ``Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing.'' (Years later Ned
Rorem considered making ``Mamba's Daughters'' into an opera.)

 UNDATED: an opera. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before he had even discussed an opera with Gershwin, Heyward was
predicting the very different shape ``Porgy'' would take once it
was set to music. It would become a work of affirmation rather than
nostalgia, and its musical genre would be hard to define.
</P>
<P>
   Enter George and Ira Gershwin _ but not exit DuBose and Dorothy
Heyward. The opera libretto follows the play faithfully. The
biggest changes are the replacement of the many traditional
spirituals in the play with newly composed songs, and the expansion
of dramatic moments in the play into musical shape, like the
insertion of the love duet ``Bess, You Is My Woman'' before Bess
leaves for the picnic.
</P>
<P>
   Although the original plan was for Ira Gershwin to write lyrics,
DuBose Heyward asked to try his hand, and he eventually wrote or
helped write most of them, including the words to ``Summertime,''
``My Man's Gone Now'' and ``A Woman Is a Sometime Thing.''
</P>
<P>
   What did George Gershwin bring to the show besides cloaking
Heyward's characters in imperishable musical garb? That
accomplishment alone would have assured the opera's success, but
Gershwin amplified the complexities that already existed, sometimes
in subliminal ways.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Melnick, in his recent book, ``A Right to Sing the
Blues,'' notes that ``Summertime'' echoes the melody of the
spiritual ``Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child.'' The
troubling words of the spiritual thus steal into the song as an
ominous undercurrent and so, as Melnick says, forecast the tragic
events to come. The subtly ironic use of musical allusions appears
again in Sportin' Life's ``It Ain't Necessarily So,'' whose melody
recalls the blessing chanted in synagogues before the reading of
the Torah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Porgy and Bess,'' however, differs from the earlier novel and
play in a more profound way that reflects the conditions of 1935.
As much as or more than an opera about blacks, it becomes an opera
about poverty, in which the inhabitants of Catfish Row are no
longer the ``other'' but are ``us.'' It is hard to say who was
responsible for this change, but it was inherent in Gershwin's
desire to compose a folk opera rather than the blackface musical Al
Jolson wanted or the grand opera Otto Kahn asked him to write for
the Metropolitan.
</P>
<P>
   The main character of a folk opera is the people, a peasantry
who sing communally in a distinctive national idiom. ``Porgy and
Bess'' presents its African-Americans not as exotic Gullahs but as
the American peasantry singing a music that is American first,
African second. Choral music frames all the action, and the fate of
the leads is always framed by the struggles of the community. The
most popular number in the score, ``I Got Plenty o' Nuttin,' ''
with lyrics by Ira Gershwin and DuBose Heyward, became its theme
song. It is at once a minstrel show banjo tune and a typical
Depression-era celebration of the pleasures of penury, like ``Now's
the Time to Fall in Love'' and ``Let's Take a Walk Around the
Block.''
</P>
<P>
   George Gershwin further enforced the universality of the story
by borrowing a device from ``Wozzeck.'' In the first scene of
Berg's opera, the title character suddenly breaks into a passionate
phrase that seems directed at the audience: ``Poor folks like us,
don't you see, Captain, must have money.'' The melody of this
phrase returns several times to become a call for compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in the first scene of ``Porgy and Bess,'' Porgy, who
has at first appeared as a ``crap shark'' well liked by the
community, suddenly gets introspective about his condition: ``When
Gawd made cripple, he mean him to be lonely. Night time, day time,
he got to trabble dat lonesome road.'' Gershwin treats his ``Night
time, day time'' melody just as Berg did his tune, bringing it back
as a plea for compassion at the end of the first scene and, later,
as the lead-in to ``Bess, You Is My Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   What would DuBose Heyward and George Gershwin think of ``Porgy
and Bess'' today? They would certainly be gratified that it is
still up and running and pleased that it has served as a
springboard for the careers of so many great black singers,
including Todd Duncan, William Warfield, Leontyne Price, Donnie Ray
Albert, Clamma Dale and Wilhelmenia Fernandez. But they might be
saddened that the more at home the work becomes in the opera house,
the more it becomes ``grand'' (at the New York City Opera as well
as the Met), the less ``folk'' it remains.

 &HT;    Religious right buoys Bush in Virginia
 &HT;    By Ken Herman and Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Once again prevailing in the South, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush easily won Tuesday's GOP presidential primary in
Virginia amid a growing Republican squabble over religion.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also trounced Arizona Sen. John McCain in the North Dakota
caucuses Tuesday night. Results from a primary in Washington state
were not available.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Bill Bradley and Vice President Al Gore
squared off in Washington, in the only Democratic contest Tuesday.
No delegates were at stake, but the former New Jersey senator hoped
for a symbolic victory there to resurrect his faltering campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen delegates were at stake in North Dakota, where Bush won
76 percent of the votes to 19 percent for McCain. Radio commentator
Alan Keyes got 5 percent. Bush won 14 delegates and McCain got
four. Keyes won a delegate.
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, Bush won 53 percent of the vote and all 56
delegates. McCain got 44 percent of the vote and Keyes got 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who was stunned last week when he lost primaries in
Michigan and Arizona, was relieved by his Virginia victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got some good news from the commonwealth of Virginia,''
Bush told cheering supporters at a rally in Cincinnati. ``Tonight,
the people of that state spoke. Tonight, the people of that state
sent a signal. Tonight, the people of that state, full of great
people, sent a message that they want George W. Bush to be the
Republican nominee for president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 13-state presidential showdown March 7, he told
supporters, ``I can't wait.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain congratulated Bush, but dismissed his victory in Virginia
as part of ``a Southern strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We look forward to Super Tuesday, when we have a broad
section, a cross-section of America voting all on that same day,''
McCain said in California.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in Atlanta late Tuesday night, Bush said he's regained
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``When March 7 is over, one of the things that will be on your
TV screen is: Here's who's got what number of delegates,'' he said.
``It will be pretty clear, and it's going to be more clear who the
nominee is going to be. It's
</P>
<P>
   going to be very clear after March 14.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas and Florida, where Bush's brother Jeb is governor, hold
their primaries March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will speak this morning at 9:40 at the Gwinnett Civic and
Cultural Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to keep working hard,'' he said. ``March 7 is the
big day, and Georgia is an important part of March 7. You're going
to hear me talk tomorrow about what I believe and where I want to
lead.''
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, both candidates drew heavily from the same blocs
that have supported them in earlier primaries. Bush captured
stalwart Republicans, as he did in his South Carolina victory Feb.
19. He particularly picked up votes from conservatives and those
who call themselves members of the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won the overwhelming support of independents and
Democrats. While those voters were responsible for the Arizona
senator's first-place finishes in Michigan and New Hampshire, they
accounted for a much smaller proportion of the Virginia electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Already looking ahead to next week's Super Tuesday primaries,
Bush campaigned Tuesday in Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati,
including stops at a Catholic charity.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Ohio, New York, California, Georgia and nine
other states vote March 7 as part of the contests that will award
more than half the delegates needed for nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In Cleveland, where Bush talked with officials at Fatima Family
Center, a Catholic charity, Ohio Gov. Robert Taft predicted Bush
would carry the state and its 69 delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush is a good candidate for Ohio because he is in
the mainstream of America, the mainstream of where the independents
and the Republicans who will be voting in our primary are,'' said
Taft, a Bush supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has been hurt by Democrats and independents voting for
McCain, could be helped in Ohio by contested Democratic races,
including the Gore-Bradley match-up.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's appearance at the Catholic charity came two days after he
announced he regrets not speaking out against anti-Catholic
policies at Bob Jones University, where he spoke Feb. 2. In a
letter to Cardinal John O'Connor of New York, Bush said he regrets
the ``missed opportunity'' to speak out against the views at the
South Carolina school.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign has been using phone calls to remind voters
of Bush's appearance at Bob Jones and his effort to lure support
from ``Southern fundamentalists who have expressed anti-Catholic
views.'' Bush has angrily accused McCain of attempting to portray
him as an ``anti-Catholic bigot.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said the Catholic center was
identified months ago as the kind of faith-based program Bush might
want to highlight.
</P>
<P>
   But Tom Mullen, president of Catholic Charities of Cleveland,
said Tuesday's event was not finalized until Sunday, the same day
Bush released his letter to O'Connor and other Catholic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Bush denied using the Cleveland event as part of an effort to
make sure he is not viewed as anti-Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to Catholic Charities because I want to herald the
greatness of America,'' Bush said. ``The greatness of America lies
in the hearts and souls of our citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, Bush continued to hammer McCain for using
tape-recorded phone messages reminding voters that Bush spoke at
Bob Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of politics needs to be set aside,'' said Bush.
``It's the kind of politics that John F. Kennedy rejected in the
1960s. It's the kind of politics we thought we put behind us in
America. It's the kind of politics that continues to persist today
because of Senator McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   He also accused McCain, who on Monday criticized evangelical
Christian leaders Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, of ``demonizing
people, holding people up for scorn.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, accused Bush of
``Election Day hysteria.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that George W. Bush is trying to run a
Jekyll and Hyde campaign where he is a Pat Robertson and Bob Jones
Republican in one state and a compassionate moderate in another,
and he's not going to get away with it,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   In California, McCain continued his attack, accusing Robertson
and Falwell of having an ``evil influence'' over the Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``To stand up and take on the forces of evil _ that's my job,
and I can't steer the Republican Party if those two individuals
have the influence that they have on the party today,'' he said to
reporters on his campaign bus as it traveled down the Central
Valley of California.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're supposed to tolerate evil in your party in the name of
party unity?'' he continued. ``That's not what the party is all
about. That's not what Abraham Lincoln said our party was about.
Theodore Roosevelt fought the forces of evil in the Republican
Party to his demise. Ronald Reagan rejected extremism in our
party.''
</P>
<P>
   While complaining about McCain's telephone calls, the Bush
campaign also used mass callings to Virginia voters in recent days
to remind them that McCain ``as chairman of the powerful Senate
Commerce Committee has pushed and fought for 48 additional flights
into Reagan National Airport.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As Governor, George W. Bush believes in limited government and
supports letting local citizens make decisions that affect their
community. The differences are clear. Senator John McCain, who is
using his power to interfere in our local issues, or Governor
George W. Bush, who believes local decisions should be made by
Virginians.''
</P>
<P>
   The calls went to voters in the airport's flight path in
Washington suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush won in Virginia because Republican voters overwhelmed
independents and Democrats who crossed party lines in support of
McCain, according to surveys of Virginia voters conducted by Voter
News Service, a consortium of The Associated Press and television
networks.
</P>
<P>
   The day after McCain labeled Robertson and Falwell ``agents of
intolerance,'' religious conservatives accounted for 20 percent of
the Virginia vote. They backed Bush 8-to-1, prompting the governor
to say, ``The voters of Virginia rejected the politics of pitting
one religion against another.''
</P>
<P>
   Backed by Gov. James Gilmore and the rest of the Virginia GOP
establishment, Bush could not afford a loss in Virginia after
leading polls there for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush dismissed suggestions by McCain's campaign that the victory
reaffirms that Bush only can win Southern conservative states. ``I
won Iowa. I won Delaware. We'll see what happens March 7,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   As he did in South Carolina 10 days earlier, Bush won in a
generally conservative, Southern state where he is popular with
rank-and-file Republicans _ the same voters who may hold the key to
victories in states where independents and Democrats are shut out
and only GOP votes count.

   THE REPUBLICANS
</P>
<P>
   BOB JONES RESPONDS: Bob Jones University, the fundamentalist
Christian institution that has become a lightening rod since Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas visited it during the South Carolina
campaign, has responded on its Web site to attacks against it.
</P>
<P>
   The university described Sen. John McCain, Vice President Al
Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley as ``the political `three
tenors,''' who together ``sing the same off-pitch tune of the
liberal left.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it really a compliment to Bob Jones University that the
likes of John McCain, Al Gore and Bill Bradley seethe and fulminate
against us?'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The university, which had previously declined to respond to
requests for comment, said its policy against interracial dating
was based on its understanding of the story of the Tower of Babel.
``The university wishes to give God the benefit of the doubt and
avoid pursuing any direction that would give assistance to the
renewed efforts of man to create a one-world community, consisting
of one religion, one economy, one government, and one race,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The university denied that it hates Catholics, saying it
regarded Catholicism on theological grounds as ``false.''
</P>
<P>
   The school said it believes it has a biblical mandate to preach
salvation by faith alone to Catholics, Jews, Buddhists, Mormons,
Muslims, atheists and ``unbelieving and religiously liberal
Protestants.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   BETWEEN GOVERNORS: Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma has some
neighborly advice for Bush. Keating, a devout Roman Catholic and
early supporter of Bush, has suggested that the Bush campaign
schedule a speech at a major Catholic university to counter any
hint of anti-Catholic bias that might have emerged after Bush's
appearance at Bob Jones University in the South Carolina primary
campaign. Noting that Bush was at a Catholic center in Cleveland on
Tuesday, Ari Fleischer, a campaign spokesman, said, ``We do
appearances at faith-based organizations all the time, so we rule
nothing out.''

   GORE IN LOS ANGELES: Campaigning in Los Angeles on Tuesday, Vice
President Al Gore referred only briefly to his rival, former Sen.
Bill Bradley, criticizing his health care plan. He had an interview
with Univision, which he was asked to conduct in Spanish. He
declined, saying, though, that he once ``was completely fluent.''
At a fund-raiser where he raised $100,000, he paid homage to the
``wonderful mosaic'' in the audience of Indians, Pakistanis, Jews,
Koreans and Latinos.

   THE POLLS
</P>
<P>
   OHIO LEANS TO BUSH: In Ohio, the first independent statewide
poll of likely Republican voters taken since the primaries in South
Carolina and Michigan showed Gov. George W. Bush of Texas ahead of
Sen. John McCain, 53 percent to 36 percent. The poll of 386 likely
Republican voters, questioned on Wednesday through Sunday, was
released on Tuesday by the Institute for Policy Research at the
University of Cincinnati. A similar poll of likely Democratic
voters showed Vice President Al Gore ahead of former Sen. Bill
Bradley, 66 percent to 22 percent. The margin of error is plus or
minus 5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, another state with a primary next Tuesday, Bush led
McCain 47 percent to 40 percent in a Potomac Survey Research poll
of likely voters for The Baltimore Sun. The poll, released Tuesday,
showed Gore ahead of Bradley, 58 percent to 23 percent. The margin
of error was plus or minus 5 percentage points.

WHERE TIME, MONEY AND TRAVEL MEET 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: (at) in e-mail address stands for the `at' symbol.)  
(jw) 
 By LISA BELKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Time, according to commercials from at least one credit card
company, is priceless. What costs is the stuff we fill it with.
Airlines, on the other hand, can tell us the exact price of our
time. Or, more specifically, the price of a Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, my work required a five-night trip to Seattle; I
would arrive late Monday and take the red-eye home on Friday so I
could spend Saturday with Bruce and our boys. The friendly ticket
agent explained that since I had called too late (by 12 hours) to
qualify for a seven-day advance purchase, the fare would be $1,898.
I, in turn, explained that I wanted to buy a seat, not the entire
plane. Sounding a touch less friendly, she clicked her keyboard for
a while, then asked if I might consider staying over until Sunday
morning. That fare would be $366.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, it was not my money I was spending, it was my
employer's, and though I do not waste anyone's money easily, at
least I had the option of booking the high-priced ticket. But
because big businesses are able to pay, small businesses are in
turn forced to pay, and the smallest business people have no choice
but to give up their Saturday nights.
</P>
<P>
   One friend, who is completing a book, schedules all his
out-of-town interviews on weekends, constantly weighing the savings
in air fare against the days lost with his family. The paradox, he
says, is that flying out on a Thursday and home on a Monday costs
hundreds of dollars less than flying out on a Monday and back on a
Thursday _ even though he is still taking up a (cramped) seat on
Thursday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Business travel is hardly the only facet of life where time can
be traded for money. But most of the others make sense. Pay a few
dollars more to an overnight delivery service and the package
actually arrives first thing the next morning. Pay $1,532 more to
an airline, and you don't get there any faster, nor is there any
decrease in the level of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, many airlines have announced that they
will start giving ``full economy'' passengers a whopping three to
seven more inches of legroom, and I will believe that when I see
it. But even in the bigger seats, I'll bet that lunch will still be
served (squashed) in a paper bag, headphones will still cost extra,
and though you will get frequent-flier miles for your loyalty and
your trouble, you won't get any more than the guy next to you,
whose flight you are subsidizing.
</P>
<P>
   And just wait until it's time to redeem those miles. In early
December, I tried to book our summer vacation. I was told the
frequent-flier allotment of seats was already sold out on every
flight to Shannon, Ireland, for the last two weeks in July.
</P>
<P>
   True, if you pay a full coach fare or have enough of those
hard-earned miles, there are ways of finagling your way into first
class; but lately those upgrades are as hard to come by as my
reward tickets to Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   And true, if you have earned enough miles, the rules say you may
board the plane early, meaning you might find a place for your
overhead luggage; but this, too, is more theory than not. ``We are
pleased to preboard our Elite Card holders,'' the flight attendant
says, and everyone in the waiting area stands up. In front of me on
the ``preboard'' line recently was a man whose Oxford insurance
card was more or less the same color as the airline's membership
card. He flashed it and ambled on.
</P>
<P>
   You do get two things, however, for the extra money you pay for
a full coach fare. First, the fare is fully refundable. In other
words, for $1,532 more, they generously allow you to cancel the
flight. In the case of my Seattle trip, this was no small benefit
because the person I was supposed to interview there backed out at
the last minute and I had to scramble to reschedule.
</P>
<P>
   The second perk is even more important. I learned about it on a
January flight to San Francisco when head winds meant the plane had
to take on extra fuel and the airline had to bump 30 passengers to
allow for the added weight.
</P>
<P>
   All around me, people were outraged. ``For $700, you'd think
they'd treat you better.'' Or, ``They bumped us because we're
flying on a $539 fare.'' I had paid $1,600 for my ticket, and when
I checked in, the agent did not even mention the weight
restrictions. She certainly never mentioned the idea of giving up
my seat.
</P>
<P>
   Pay them enough money and you are actually permitted to board
the plane. Now that's priceless.

 COLUMN: CHEERS FOR WORK! RAH! RAH!  (jw) 
 By CHARLOTTE ST. MARTIN with CHARLES BUTLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charlotte St. Martin is the executive vice president for
marketing, Loews Hotels.
</P>
<P>
   I work 70, 80 hours a week _ I love to work. It has been that
way since I was 12 and I got my first job at a movie theater in
Grand Prairie, Texas. That is also when I made up my mind that I
was going to be an executive and not have any children.
</P>
<P>
   I needed that job to buy a cashmere sweater. My mother probably
thought I would do baby-sitting. Well, I got a job as a
concessionaire, and I loved it. I love work _ the interaction, the
creativity, the products. I love making sales.
</P>
<P>
   My funniest job was when I was a junior at Grand Prairie High
School. I was a cheerleader, but the cheerleader costumes were very
expensive. To pay for them, the cheerleaders would work during the
summer at the Susan Crane Packaging Co., which did package
decorations for Neiman Marcus. After a day's work, our hands would
be frayed, but the job was a hoot. Here were six girls who spoke no
Spanish on an assembly line that was virtually all Hispanic,
stapling, cutting, pasting decorations. And yet we somehow learned
how to communicate, and we made some wonderful friends.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure how I got my business drive. It wasn't from my
father. He was killed in World War II, in May 1945, two months
before I was born. He was only 21. But my mom worked, as did my
grandmother, and they were very supportive of my desire to be
successful, which was unusual for a girl growing up in the late
'50s and early '60s.
</P>
<P>
   But I'll be honest: I'm not a feminist. My attitude was never,
``Why are men holding me back?'' It was, ``If I work harder, if I
find a solution, then I'll be recognized, and that will make it
easier for other women.'' I believe each gender should have to pay
its dues and get the experience.
</P>
<P>
   And believe me, the hotel business was a man's business when I
started out. My first job in the hospitality industry was planning
all the opening events when the Fairmont Hotel in Dallas opened in
1969. I left the Fairmont in 1977 and became the first person hired
by the Anatole Hotel, which is also in Dallas and even today is one
of the largest convention hotels in the country. I ended up staying
17 years, becoming the first woman to be CEO of a major hotel.
</P>
<P>
   I remember once, after I had become the CEO, my uncle picking me
up at the airport and asking me, ``Why does your husband let you
travel so much?'' It made me think, ``Oh, my God! Would I be any
different if my dad had lived, and if I had grown up in Boston,
where he was from, in a regular Catholic family?'' Until that
moment it had never occurred to me that I was doing something
unusual.
</P>
<P>
   At Loews Hotels, as keeper of the brand, it's my job to give
7,000 employees the ``Loews personality'' so they can deliver a
unique experience to guests. Four years ago we started our largest
expansion in history. I'm in charge of developing our hotels'
image; it's a perfect job because I can be my creative self. We're
in the entertainment business. People want to be pampered. Instead
of just giving guests a mint on their pillow, I came up with the
idea of having warm chocolate-chip cookies and milk served in cow
mugs waiting for them.
</P>
<P>
   But you know, I've been entertaining for a long time. High
school football in Texas was a big show; that's where people went
on Friday nights. And there is nothing like being a cheerleader.
Funny, I still have my cheerleader shirt and jacket that I worked
all summer to pay for. And they fit, too.

<P>
   BAKERSFIELD, Calif. _ Sen. John McCain intensified the battle
over the political power of the religious right Tuesday as he
accused Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell of having an ``evil
influence'' over the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Gov. George W. Bush sharply attacked McCain,
his rival for the Republican presidential nomination, for ``pitting
one religion against another.''
</P>
<P>
   Their comments Tuesday came as the see-saw battle for the
Republican nomination tilted once again to the Bush side with the
Texas governor winning a lopsided victory over McCain in the
Virginia primary.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Cincinnati, Bush said the Virginia results bring the
Republicans ``one step closer to victory'' and ``one step closer to
a united party.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's statements Tuesday, following his incendiary attack
on the leaders of the Christian right the day before, seemed to
continue if not escalate his effort to marginalize what has been an
important segment of the Republican Party for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Monday, McCain called Robertson and Falwell
``agents of intolerance.'' He went further Tuesday, criticizing
them for ``the evil influence that they exercise over the
Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To stand up and take on the forces of evil, that's my job, and
I can't steer the Republican Party if those two individuals have
the influence that they have on the party today,'' he said Tuesday,
speaking to reporters on his campaign bus as it traveled down the
Central Valley of California.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're supposed to tolerate evil in your party in the name of
party unity?'' he continued. ``That's not what the party is all
about. That's not what Abraham Lincoln said our party was about.
Theodore Roosevelt fought the forces of evil in the Republican
Party to his demise. Ronald Reagan rejected extremism in our
party.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though McCain's assault on the Christian Right did him
little good, if any, with voters in Virginia, he is casting himself
as the one candidate who can rescue the Republican Party from
religious leaders who, he argues, preach ``a message of intolerance
and exclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   He has portrayed Bush as deeply indebted to the leadership of
the Christian right, which sprang to his aid during the bitter
weeks of campaigning in South Carolina before the state's
Republican primary on Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   To further that effort, McCain's campaign said Tuesday that it
had been calling voters in Washington state, which also held its
Republican primary Tuesday. The calls, McCain aides said, alerted
voters that Bush had campaigned at Bob Jones University in South
Carolina without condemning that school's anti-Catholic teachings.
The senator's campaign made similar calls in Michigan for its
primary, which McCain won last week.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also complained Tuesday about ``vicious attacks'' by
leaders of the religious right on Gen. Colin Powell, the former
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and on former Sen. Warren
Rudman, R-N.H., the co-chairman of McCain's national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping that one of the motivations for embracing our
vision is that every one of Falwell's and Robertson's candidates
lost in the 1998 elections _ every single one of them,'' McCain
told reporters. ``Now, if your job is to go on continued kamikaze
missions, then fine. But if you want to change that and start
regaining the majority that we had in the '80s, then you've got to
change the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Falwell and Robertson said both declined to comment on
McCain's attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In Stockton, a reporter asked McCain whether he was worried that
his speech on Monday would fracture a winning coalition for the
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me,'' McCain cut in. ``A winning coalition? Which
winning coalition are we talking about in a state that has lost the
last two presidential elections, that has lost the last two
congressional elections. Here in California, it's been an electoral
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also announced Tuesday that he would participate after
all in a debate here on Thursday night. The debate, sponsored by
The Los Angeles Times, will be broadcast live on CNN. On Sunday,
McCain's aides said that he had pulled out of the debate in order
to campaign in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to pull out resulted in a wave of unfavorable news
coverage, and the Bush campaign gleefully portrayed it as a
strategic retreat by McCain, who still trails badly among
California Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain's aides tried to counter that impression by
pointing out all the time and television money they are spending
here, they came to recognize that it looked terrible for their
candidate not to appear at the only debate scheduled before this
state's primary next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want the debates, symbolically, to be
misinterpreted,'' said McCain's senior strategist, Mike Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   McCain plans now to participate by satellite hook-up, and Bush's
staff said he might do the same.
</P>
<P>
   But in addressing one controversy, McCain created yet another,
this one over his level of candor with reporters when confronted
with sticky questions about the conduct of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, McCain and his aides first denied responsibility for
a series of phone calls to Roman Catholic voters in Michigan
telling them about Bush's appearance at Bob Jones University.
Later, they acknowledged that the campaign had paid a telemarketing
firm $8,000 to make 24,000 phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, when first asked whether he had ruled out
appearing at the debate, either in person or by satellite feed,
McCain replied in seemingly unambiguous terms. ``There's no
possible way,'' he said, adding that ``we cannot flex our
schedule'' to debate Bush.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, minutes after finishing a town hall meeting,
McCain called a press conference to say that he would debate after
all.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over, reporters asked why he had changed his mind, and
over and over McCain repeated the same response: ``Because we were
able to change our schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, under persistent questioning, McCain, who calls his bus
the Straight Talk Express and who concludes almost every stump
speech by promising ``to always tell you the truth, no matter
what,'' acknowledged that he had not been candid with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real deal is that as frank and honest and straight talk as
our express is, sometimes I don't share all of the inner workings
and contemplations of our campaign,'' he said, revealing that he
had earlier instructed his aides to explore the possibility of
participating in the debate by satellite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we were ready to make that change, I apologize for not
sharing my musings with you as to how we achieve being in the
debate,'' he said, then adding with a cackle, ``But from now on,
straight talk.''

COURT RULES AGAINST NURSING HOME CHALLENGES TO MEDICARE
REGULATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid nursing home bankruptcies and growing concerns about the
quality of care, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that nursing
homes could not challenge Medicare regulations in federal court
unless they first go through an administrative hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-4 ruling comes at a time of heightened awareness of
nursing home problems. In December, the Clinton administration said
it would expand the use of immediate federal financial penalties
against homes that violate health and safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Missouri officials said low wages were driving down
the quality of care at Missouri nursing homes and declared an
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, seven big nursing home operators have sought
bankruptcy protection in the past seven months.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court decision was criticized by the American Health
Care Association in Washington. In a statement, the association
said the ``requirement to use an overly bureaucratic administrative
review process to challenge an entire regulatory scheme prevents
the timely judicial scrutiny of a system that has harmed both
patients and providers.''
</P>
<P>
   The high-court ruling also was criticized by Arkansas-based
Beverly Enterprises Inc., the largest U.S. nursing home chain,
though Beverly was not a party in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system is broken,'' said Dan Springer, a spokesman for
Beverly, which has nursing homes in Kansas and Missouri. ``It makes
absolutely no sense. One has to wonder what the end game is in a
system that focuses on punishment rather than rewarding good
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   But Douglas Carter, a Kansas City lawyer who specializes in
nursing home abuse and negligence cases, said the Supreme Court
case indicated that ``there are a lot of nursing home operators
with a lot of money that are willing to fight in any way possible
to avoid having people looking over their shoulder and making sure
they do what they're supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Krisztal, an Overland Park lawyer who also specializes in
cases of nursing home abuse and negligence, said the nursing home
industry had been challenging federal regulations for many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice to consumers is to keep on making complaints to the
appropriate agency, to investigate poor care in nursing homes and
keep a close eye on their loved ones,'' Krisztal said. ``They have
to visit, they have to view their conditions.''

KIWIS' CUP LEAD MOVES TO 4-0
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ Mercifully, the end is near.
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of an early, lethal Prada blunder, Team New
Zealand coasted to its fourth consecutive victory over the Italian
challenger Wednesday to stake a commanding 4-0 lead in the
five-of-nine-race finals for the America's Cup. Race 5 is scheduled
for Thursday and, should the result hold true to form, for the
sailors from Milan the end will not have come a moment too soon.
</P>
<P>
   As in the first three races of the series, the Kiwis won the
start, took control up the first windward beat, then denied the
challengers any semblance of a passing lane around the rest of the
track. There was only one small difference in Wednesday afternoon's
lopsided duel. For a brief, shining moment, the Italians made a
race of it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Prada crew showed some true heart in the early
going and, at one point up the first windward leg, even held the
lead. But it gave it away with a tactical error that summed up its
sad overall performance in the regatta. Frankly, once again, the
better team won.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in celebration of his 38th birthday, or maybe simply to
break the monotony, in the prestart sequence the Kiwi skipper,
Russell Coutts, ordered the hoisting of what is known as a Code
Zero genoa, a light-air headsail that supposedly would provide
extra acceleration in the trifling 7-to-8-knot northeasterly, and
which was making its first appearance in the regatta.
</P>
<P>
   It did not make much difference, for despite the Prada tactician
Torben Grael's assertion, ``We must have the left,'' he was
perfectly content off the starting line to direct Luna Rossa to the
right-hand side of the course. But it would prove to be a telling
remark.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Kiwi tactician Brad Butterworth had NZL 60 in
the right place at the right time for, from his spot to the left of
Prada, he was perfectly positioned for the tiny left-hand shift
that filled in soon after the starting gun sounded. And up the
first third of the beat, Butterworth was cautious to protect his
turf.
</P>
<P>
   But Prada was hanging tough, showing a good turn of speed, and
when the boats came together for the second crossing, the Italians
were on starboard tack _ which means they held nautical
right-of-way _ and in an ideal position to maintain and consolidate
what was clearly a slight lead. Grael had two options: to tack back
and cover the Kiwis, the conventional match-racing move, or to
cross them and sail off to the left.
</P>
<P>
   Though circumstances had changed drastically, the latter choice
was the one Grael had wanted early on. Now, he gambled everything
that the left would still hold the more favorable breeze.
</P>
<P>
   But Grael was dead wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The next significant observation came from Coutts, who had been
happy to dip behind the Italians, take the right side of the
course, and accept a small loss for the risk of a far greater gain.
``This is a right-hander,'' he said soon after, noting a swing in
the breeze. For the Italians, the translation was, ``Game and
set.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kiwis had exhibited, yet again, an uncanny ability to stay
in phase with the shifts. Prada continued to the left. From a
racing standpoint, it had just sailed off the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a nice little puff coming down here,'' said
Butterworth, as the Kiwis built on their fresh and soon-to-be
untouchable lead. At the top end of the leg, Butterworth called for
repeated tacks and used the inside advantage to push the Italians
out past the lay line to the mark.
</P>
<P>
   For Prada, it was once again going from bad to worse. The body
language on the Italian boat spoke volumes. The fight was no longer
a fair one.
</P>
<P>
   The New Zealanders rounded the top mark with a 45-second lead,
but Prada took back 6 seconds on the ensuing run. It was not an
indication of things to come. The Kiwis' final margin of victory
was 1 minute 49 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, Coutts brought his record to 9-0 in America's
Cup finals, tying the mark set by the legendary cup skipper Charlie
Barr, who also posted nine straight triumphs in three successful
defenses between 1899 and 1903.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Coutts will try to reach and define a new standard
of excellence in the long, storied history of cup competition. The
stunned, defeated Italians are the only ones who can reverse what
appears to be a date with destiny. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: PENALTIES HAUNTING `PROGRAMS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: UPDATES throughout with St. John's beating Seton Hall,
comments from athletic director; deletes some earlier material.) 
 (jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The wheels are coming loose at many so-called programs. College
basketball teams are hoping to hold parts together with chewing gum
and baling wire and appeals and briefs just to get through the
national tournament.
</P>
<P>
   After that, they'll just let attrition and penalties and
ambition and professional money take their natural course. Since
undergraduates started flocking to the crass-but-honest dollar
standard of the National Basketball Association, college basketball
has become a year-by-year proposition, now operating on day-by-day
eligibility bulletins.
</P>
<P>
   Or, sometimes it is even minute-by-minute. Tuesday night,
shortly before before St. John's beat Seton Hall, 66-60, in Madison
Square Garden, Erick Barkley was suspended for the second time this
season for violations of rules of the National Collegiate Athletic
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley was originally suspended for two games for trading cars
with somebody who was identified as a family friend but who also
had ties to a major summer basketball league in New York.
</P>
<P>
   This time Barkley was suspended for apparently having accepted
between $2,500 and $4,000 to help pay the hefty tuition at a Maine
prep school he had attended for a year. The tuition had been paid
by a committee at Riverside Church that maintains a powerful
amateur basketball program partly underwritten by Ernie Lorch, a
wealthy New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   The weird thing about the Barkley's absence is that after weeks
of speculation and legal skirmishing, St. John's still has not been
able to broker a definite penalty, so it can know if it can depend
on Barkley for the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will appeal for immediate reinstatement,'' said Ed Manetta
Jr., the athletic director, who said the university did not concede
any violation by Barkley on the tuition money. ``We divert from
each other on interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   One game might seem to be the going rate, since last Wednesday
DerMarr Johnson of Cincinnati was suspended for one game for
accepting $7,000 from an amateur coach to attend the same prep
school as Barkley. But St. John's is not helping itself with the
NCAA by delaying its submission until Tuesday, and not
acknowledging wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The tone was continued by Mike Jarvis, St. John's coach, after
the game. He called Barkley ``a young man who has done nothing
wrong'' and said, ``He's lost three games that he should never have
lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The response by the NCAA must come soon because St. John's has
one game left and the Big East tournament, and the NCAA tournament
and then Barkley is liable to be gone _ off to the NBA for real
money.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's lengthened its winning streak to eight Tuesday night
after having beaten Duke last Saturday. The Duke coach, Mike
Krzyzewski, appealed to the Duke students to spare Barkley from
their normal dosage of vicious but witty heckling, which, by and
large, they did.
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski almost never has to deal with indiscretions by his
players, but he did feel a sense of vulnerability last spring when
three players departed with eligibility remaining, a sign of the
times, to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   At other schools, college players were undergoing various
investigations, allegations, suspicions, rumors, confessions, mea
culpas and nolo contenderes and all that other good legal stuff
that makes big-time college basketball such a wholesome sight.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to make any kind of wage for their labors, the players
are hounded by the NCAA for every dime or favor they have accepted,
in all their youthful innocence, you understand.
</P>
<P>
   This has popped up at Auburn, Cincinnati, UCLA and Michigan,
while Connecticut has had its own discipline problems.
</P>
<P>
   The latest incident was at Auburn, where the star forward Chris
Porter has been suspended for taking $2,500 from a sports agent.
The story coming out of Auburn is that Porter took the money to
help keep his mother from being evicted, which could be true, but
Porter is not likely to get mercy points from the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   JaRon Rush, the star at UCLA, took $6,525 from an amateur coach,
but when Rush agreed to pay the money back, the NCAA shortened his
suspension to nine games, making him eligible to play again
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Given the hardships and realities of life, it is no wonder why
players might reach out and accept tuition money or rent money. The
NCAA struggles to keep up with the machinations, but it is a weary,
grinding business, and it is hard to imagine anybody has any heart
for it.
</P>
<P>
   Most coaches just want to keep the vehicle barreling toward
March Madness, and deal with the details down the line. How long
can this system survive?  &QL;

BUSH, GORE FAVORED TO WIN MISSOURI PRIMARY, POLL SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
 -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Sen. John McCain of Arizona trails Texas Gov.
George W. Bush in a Missouri GOP primary match-up but would be the
better candidate in the general election, a statewide survey
indicates.
</P>
<P>
   In a hypothetical race against Vice President Al Gore _ the
likely winner of the Democratic contest Tuesday _ McCain would win
by 48-38 percent, according to the poll commissioned by The Kansas
City Star. When Bush is matched against Gore, however, the result
is a statistical dead heat, 44-42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As he has in other states, McCain scored highest among
Missouri's independent voters. And when all likely voters were
asked by pollsters about which of the four leading presidential
candidates had the strongest ``personal character and highest
integrity,'' the poll showed McCain far ahead with 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The next-highest rating went to former Sen. Bill Bradley of New
Jersey, 19 percent. Bush had 16 percent, Gore had 13 percent and
the remainder of the respondents were unsure.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents to the poll by far rated personal character _ 47
percent _ to be the most important factor in voting for the next
occupant of the White House. Less than three in 10 chose the
candidates' stands on issues. Experience was important to 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   With Missouri's Republican presidential primary just six days
away, the survey by Mason-Dixon Polling &AMP; Research showed Bush with
a 48-36 percent lead with 13 percent still undecided. Alan Keyes,
the conservative former ambassador, drew 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Gore appeared to be headed to an easy
victory in Bradley's home state. The vice president led Bradley,
who grew up in Crystal City, Mo., by 53-33 percent with 14 percent
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri will be one of 16 states participating in next week's
Super Tuesday round of primaries and caucuses that will go a long
way toward determining each party's nominees. Voters in Missouri
will be able to select a presidential-preference ballot from among
five parties: Democratic, Republican, Libertarian, Reform and
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Because Missouri does not register voters by party, they are
free to take a ballot from any of the parties.
</P>
<P>
   In other poll findings:
</P>
<P>
   - When asked which option was favored for any federal budget
surplus, only 14 percent said ```cut taxes across the board for all
Americans,'' a major policy of Bush. Twice as many called for
strengthening Social Security and Medicare. About one out of five
suggested paying down the national debt and 19 percent would invest
the money in new programs to improve education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   - On the question of which candidate has taken positions on
issues that were most similar to the respondent's, McCain had 29
percent to Gore's 27 percent. Bush was third with 18 percent, while
Bradley had 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   - Gore topped the field with 37 percent to Bush's 24 percent
when respondents were asked which candidate had the most experience
and was ``best qualified to do the job.'' McCain had 20 percent and
Bradley 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Star poll displayed a deep disparity between Bush and McCain
when it came to drawing support from independents and rank-and-file
Republicans. In a development seen in other states, Bush draws
nearly three times more support _ 63 percent to McCain's 22 _ from
voters who identified themselves as Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But among independents who said they planned to vote Tuesday,
McCain had a sizable edge _ 57-26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Independent voters could make up 40 percent of next Tuesday's
vote, said J. Bradford Coker, Mason-Dixon managing director. He
estimated that about six of 10 independent voters would take
Republican ballots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The independent vote is critical in Missouri,'' said David
Steelman, McCain's Missouri chairman. ``Independents hold the key
not only to the November election, but they hold the key in the
primaries.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush supporters also are confident of their strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased by those numbers,'' said Catherine Hanaway,
Bush's executive campaign director in Missouri. ``It means the
campaign we're running for the nomination in Missouri is going very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has made the theme of ``compassionate conservatism''
the cornerstone of his campaign, did much better, 53 percent, among
likely women voters in the GOP primary. McCain got slightly less
than one in three. Among Republican men, Bush received 44 percent
and McCain 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has said that Missouri is a must-win for him. Still
struggling to notch his first victory of the campaign season, the
former senator from New Jersey has suggested that he will
reconsider his candidacy if he doesn't have a strong showing on
Super Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think obviously we have to score some victories on March
7,'' Bradley spokesman Tony Wyche said. ``We think Missouri is a
good state for us. It's a state where people appreciate plain
speaking, which is what this campaign has really been about.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Hattaway, Gore's spokesman, said, ``It's nice to be up in
the polls, especially in Missouri. But we're not taking anybody's
vote for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore scored the highest of any candidate among women, with 59
percent, a better than 2-to-1 advantage over Bradley among likely
female Democratic voters. Among men, he led 46-39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley attracted more independents, however.
</P>
<P>
   In the future general election match-ups, the survey indicated 3
percent would support Pat Buchanan, a Reform Party candidate, in a
race involving Bush, and that dropped to 2 percent if McCain were
on the GOP ballot.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, March 1:
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times said i A vote scheduled for Wednesday in the
New York Senate will test which comes first with Republican members
_ party loyalty or democratic principle. At issue is the fate of
Senate Bill 6482, the measure devised by the Democratic minority
leader, Martin Connor, to clean up the closed-ballot system that
forced Sen. John McCain to wage an expensive legal battle to
compete statewide in New York's March 7 presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Under Connor's legislation, the onerous petition rules that
quadrennially trip up leading White House hopefuls, and make the
Empire State look like a petty dictatorship, would be history. So
would the ability of Republican leaders to rig the primary ballot
for their presidential favorite, much as Gov. George Pataki and
other GOP bosses tried to do for Gov. George W. Bush. Instead, the
executive director of the State Board of Elections would simply put
on the ballot all ``nationally known and recognized candidates''
who wish to appear. Those names, moreover, would appear in easily
readable type, not in the minuscule lettering that will confront
voters in next week's Republican contest here as they hunt for the
delegate slate committed to their presidential choice.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's key vote will come on a motion to bring Connor's
bill to the Senate floor for consideration on the merits. Joseph
Bruno, the Senate majority leader, plans to rally his Republican
caucus to cast a party-line vote against the motion, playing down
the significance of the showdown by labeling the vote merely
``procedural.'' That should fool no one. A vote against discharging
Connor's bill from the certain burial ground of the Elections
Committee is the equivalent of a vote against the bill itself.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno says he supports reform, but calls Connor's bill
``flawed.'' A reformer, though, would amend the bill to correct any
real flaws. He would not kill it.
