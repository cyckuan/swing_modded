<HEADLINE> US Factory Orders for Durable Goods Up in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories for
durable goods rose by 1.5 percent to a record level in February,
the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that orders for durable goods, items
expected to last for more than three years, rose to a seasonally
adjusted 178.3 billion dollars resulting from increasing demand
for communications and other electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
The report said orders for electronic equipment rose by 7.4
percent in February on top of a 17.9 percent gain in the month
before. Orders climbed 2.2 percent for industrial machinery, the
third consecutive increase.
</P>
<P>
However, the often volatile transportation category fell 3.6
percent, with decreases in all components except railroads.
Primary metals such as steel edged 0.5 percent lower, the first
decline since October.
</P>
<P>
Overall, unfilled orders rose 1.1 percent, the ninth increase
in 10 months. A growing backlog of orders suggests manufacturers
will have to increase production and manpower to meet demand.
</P>
<P>
Orders for durable goods are a key barometer of the
manufacturing strength in the country. Today's report contributed
to economists' belief that the U.S. economy is growing briskly in
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve raised the short-term interest rate
Tuesday by a quarter of a percentage point to curb the inflation
at a time when the economy is expanding more quickly than
expected.

<HEADLINE> PNG PM to Stand Aside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinea Prime Minister
Julius Chan decided to stand aside under the increasing pressure
mounted over his secret deal to use mercenaries on Bougainville.
</P>
<P>
Julius announced his decision to a special meeting of
parliament this afternoon after parliament rejected a motion
calling for him to step down yesterday.
</P>
<P>
But parliament's rejection sparked strong reaction from
thousands of people and soldiers who were waiting outside the
parliament house. They started stoning cars and blocking entrances
to parliament all the night.
</P>
<P>
In his 20 minute statement, Julius said he would direct his
Deputy Prime Minister Chris Haiveta and Defense Minister Mathias
Ijape to step down with him.
</P>
<P>
All three were reported to have shared responsibility for the
Sandline deal, in which the government secretly arranged to spend
38 million US dollars to hire mercenaries to fight on the troubled
island of Bougainville.
</P>
<P>
As his statement was relayed outside parliament, a crowd of
about 2000 people cheered and some chanted "Singirok, Singirok" to
honor sacked defense chief Jerry Singirok who sparked the crisis
last week with a call for Julius to resign.
</P>
<P>
Julius also said he would push for national elections scheduled
for June to be brought forward.
</P>
<P>
Julius, 57, is an experienced politician in PNG. He has twice
become prime minister, and the first time was in 1980.

today said that Russia has placed priority on developing cooperative
relations of good-neighborliness and friendship with China.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking forward to (Chinese) President Jiang Zemin's

promote Russian-Chinese relations," Chernomyrdin told Chinese Vice
Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, who arrived here Monday

"We hope that the two sides will make constant efforts to
insert momentum in developing Russian-Chinese ties in an all-round
way," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian prime minister said that he was also looking
forward to his visit to China in late May for the second regular
meeting with Chinese Premier Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that Li's visit to Russia at the end of last year
marked the official start of a mechanism of regular meetings
between the premiers of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Facts show that the mechanism of regular high-level meetings is
highly effective and of great significance in deepening bilateral
cooperation in various fields, especially in the economy and
trade, he said.

MOSCOW, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia's government reshuffle
ended today after a string of new appointments over the last two
weeks aimed at boosting the economy and the government's
popularity.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin met Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
and other senior cabinet members in the Kremlin and signed a
number of decrees on appointments to the remaining vacant posts in
the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Former Economics Minister Yevgeny Yasin, seen as a leading
light in many of Russia's economic reforms, was appointed minister
without portfolio.
</P>
<P>
But Chernomyrdin told a press conference Yasin would coordinate
and review government policy and deal with economic questions.
</P>
<P>
Anatoly Chubais, appointed First Deputy Prime Minister last
week, was also given responsibility for issues associated with the
mass media. Former First Deputy Minister Mikhail Fradkov will

Trade, Chernomyrdin announced.
</P>
<P>
Former Deputy Communications Minister Alexander Krupnov has
been appointed head of the State Committee for Communications and
Information in the new cabinet, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
President Yeltsin, back in command after months of illness,
ordered the wide-ranging cabinet reshuffle in an attempt to get

the government unpopular.
</P>
<P>
Wage and pension arrears nationwide are running at about 9
billion U.S. dollars and strikes have become commonplace as
workers protest against the nonpayment of wages. In February,

<HEADLINE> Great Potential for Malaysia-China Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 26 (Xinhua) -- There exists great potential
for Malaysia and China to promote their economic cooperation as
China provides a vast market, Malaysian Deputy International Trade
and Industry Minister Kerk Choo Ting said here today.
</P>
<P>
China might become one of the largest economies in the world in
the near future, providing greater opportunities for businessmen
in Malaysia and other parts of the world, he said in an interview
with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Kerk said great achievements had already been made in recent
years in the economic cooperation between Malaysia and China,
which covers two aspects -- trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the two countries are trading in traditional
items, he said, adding "there exists greater potential for a boost
in bilateral trade, if both sides add more value-added, high-tech
products to the exchange lists while upgrading the traditional
ones."
</P>
<P>
As for mutual investment, he said Malaysian investors are
investing in areas such as tourism-related industries, palm oil
refinery, property market and infrastructure in China while
Chinese investors are investing in steel production, machinery
manufacturing and property market in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Though the amount was comparatively small so far, property
market and the infrastructure sector in China have great potential
for Malaysian investors, he said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister said his government encouraged the private
sector to invest overseas in those areas where "we have
competitive advantages."
</P>
<P>
As Malaysia is concerned, he said "it is still a good place for
investment with attractive incentives, political and economic
stability, social harmony, environmental protection, low inflation
and legal framework."
</P>
<P>
Direct foreign investment in the country is "increasing from
year to year" and most attractive areas or sector for investment
in Malaysia are electric and electronics, petrochemicals,
technology, basic infrastructure and property market, he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Seeks to Narrow Trade Gap With France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
conveyed its desire to the French government to narrow down their
lopsided trade balance which remains in favor of Paris, the
Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino
formally conveyed Manila's position on the issue in the recently
concluded Second Philippine-France Sub-Ministerial Consultation
meeting in Manila.
</P>
<P>
Severino asked his French counterpart, Foreign Ministry
Secretary General Bertrand Dufouraq, to increase the level of
French investments in the country, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Severino noted that while French companies here lately showed
greater interest in investing in the country, the Philippines
still lags behind other ASEAN countries in terms of French trade
and investments.
</P>
<P>
French investments in the Philippines recently increased
dramatically with the participation of French Lyonnaise des Eaux
in the privatization of the Manila Waterworks and Sewerage
Authority.
</P>
<P>
Other French companies involved in major Philippine projects
include the BCEOM which will undertake the North Luzon Expressway
Extension to Subic; the Aerospatiale which will install the
Philippines' first satellite and Airbus Industries which is
involved in the massive refleeting program of the Philippine
Airlines (PAL).
</P>
<P>
PAL's refleeting program, which involves the acquisition of an
additional 36 new aircraft for the country's national carrier,
contributed the most to the trade imbalance between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures show that Philippine-French bilateral trade for
1996 reached 528.24 million US dollars. Of the total, French
export to the Philippines was 173.32 million US dollars in excess
of Manila export to Paris.

<P>
HELSINKI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Finland's exports of high-tech
products rose 17 percent last year to 5.06 billion U.S. dollars, a
report by the Finnish Statistics Center said today.
</P>
<P>
Exports of high-tech products accounted for 13.6 percent of the
country's total exports in 1996, compared with 12.4 percent in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications equipment took the lion's share, with 66
percent of high-tech exports, up 6 percent from 1995. Exports of
computers and instruments, a main export sector, fell slightly in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the increase in high-tech exports to the
government's support for the development of high-tech products.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that in 1995 the government allocated 2.3
percent of gross domestic product to the development of high-tech
products.
</P>
<P>
As for high-tech imports, the report said Finland imported 4.28
billion dollars worth of high-tech products in 1996, of which

<HEADLINE> Togo Urges Concrete Measures to Stop Wars in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOME, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Togo's President Gnassingbe Eyadema
urged here today that African countries must take concrete
measures to stop wars in the African continent.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a grand opening ceremony for the first
extraordinary session of heads of state and government of the
Central Organ of the OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention,
Management and Resolution to seek a peaceful solution to the
Zaire crisis.
</P>
<P>
Eyadema said: "It is a must for us to take concrete measures
to stop the bleeding caused by wars which are weakening Africa,
breeding sentiments of hatred and are likely to lead to the
dismemberment of the Organization of African Unity."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the special summit in quest of a solution to the
conflict in the Great Lakes region is "highly crucial for the
safeguard of the African unity", he noted.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the situation in the region is "seriously
alarming" and the devastations of the war in Zaire are likely to
"cause the implosion of the whole Africa".
</P>
<P>
"Our continent is faced with conflicts, disasters, threats and
refugee movements it never witnessed before", said the host
president.
</P>
<P>
But the time has come for Africa to take its destiny into its
own hands so that the OAU could efficiently apply the mechanism
for the prevention, the management and the settlements of
conflicts, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"This extraordinary summit to seek solutions to the crisis in
the Great Lakes region is a big challenge that we must take up"
to demonstarte "our political political maturity and our genuine
willingness for peace", he said.
</P>
<P>
President Eyadema expressed his optimitism about a negotiated
settlement to the Zirean conflict, "because there is never a
problem without a solution".
</P>
<P>
He called on the conflicting parties in the Zaire crisis to
show a sense of goodwill so that a peaceful solution can be
found.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen African heads of state are attending the two-day
summit with 30 African countries and the two warring sides of
Zaire represented. OAU Secretary General Salim Ahamed Salim, UN
chief Koffi Annan and representatives of the United States,
Britain, France, Germany and the European Union are also present.

<P>
Stuart Eizenstat, the U.S. special envoy on Cuba policy, and
Sir Leon Brittan, the EU trade commissioner, had four hours of
talks here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The talks were described as being constructive by senior
officials from both sides.
</P>
<P>
"We have a better understanding of each other's needs and
ideas," said Eizenstat. "There are still significant hurdles,
but progress has been made."
</P>
<P>
As a gesture of his "desire to continue intensive talks," Sir
Leon has agreed to send a group of officials from the European
Commission, the EU's executive body, to Washington for discussions
next week, a spokesman for the commission said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have been making every effort to reach a settlement
before mid-April, when a WTO panel is scheduled to open hearings
into an EU complaint against the U.S. Helms-Burton Act which
sanctions a third country that does business in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. gave a vigorous reaction to the recent appointment by
the WTO of three panelists to hear the case. Eizenstat even
indicated that Washington would refuse to cooperate with the panel
by citing the rarely invoked national security clause in the rules
governing international trade.
</P>
<P>
However, neither the EU nor Washington want to see the threat
really carried out because it would pose a serious threat to the
credibility of the WTO, as one U.S. official admitted here
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Traditional Chinese Art Should Be Enhanced: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The development of traditional
Chinese art should be further enhanced, said President Jiang
Zemin, who visited this evening an exhibition of the late Chinese
painter Pan Tianshou at the China Art Gallery.
</P>
<P>
Looking carefully at the painter's representative works of
different periods with great interest, Jiang, who is also
Secretary-General of the Communist Party of China Central
Committee, spoke highly of the national characteristics reflected
in the works.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also expressed his hope that the art workers throughout
the country will also learn from other nations' cultural
heritages, to further promote China's art undertakings.
</P>
<P>
Regarded as one of the main founders of China's modern
educational system for traditional Chinese paintings, Pan
Tianshou, born 100 years ago, was one of the masters of
traditional Chinese paintings this century.
</P>
<P>
Experts say Pan's works have a sense of strength and the
structural beauty, and are full of the essence of life
itself. While his works fully represent the traditional way of
painting, he went beyond the traditions and created his own
understandings of art.
</P>
<P>
Some sixty works, most of which were done during the painter's
later years, were showed this time.

state visit to Russia (next month), which will undoubtedly further
promote Russian-Chinese relations," Chernomyrdin told Chinese Vice
Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, who arrived here Monday
on a four-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
He said he was glad to know that Qian had discussed all aspects
of Sino-Russian relations with President Boris Yeltsin and Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the two sides will make constant efforts to
insert momentum in developing Russian-Chinese ties in an all-round
way," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian prime minister said that he was also looking
forward to his visit to China in late May for the second regular
meeting with Chinese Premier Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that Li's visit to Russia at the end of last year
marked the official start of a mechanism of regular meetings
between the premiers of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Facts show that the mechanism of regular high-level meetings is
highly effective and of great significance in deepening bilateral
cooperation in various fields, especially in the economy and
trade, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the two sides, through concerted efforts, can
attain the target of increasing bilateral trade turnover to 20
billion U.S. dollars by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side is willing to explore new ways of cooperation
and expand the scope of cooperation with Russia, the Chinese vice
premier said.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said Russia and China should build long-term,
stable trade relations, as the two nations enjoy bright prospects
for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Russian side is willing to participate in China's
large-scale projects, he said, and is keen on expanding
cooperation with China in the fields of oil, natural gas, nuclear
energy, machinery and shipping, Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
Russia believes the two sides should help supply each other's
commodity needs, and progressively increase bilateral trade.

<HEADLINE> Manila Mulls Plan to Solve Sugar Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
said today that the government is working out a program to resolve
the sugar price crisis which has plagued the country since last
October.
</P>
<P>
But Ramos refused to remove Wilson Gamboa, chief of the Sugar
Regulatory Administration (SRA), from his post as demanded by
sugarcane planters.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his weekly press conference, Ramos said the sugar
crisis will not be resolved by "the removal of people."
</P>
<P>
Ramos promised to solve the problem facing the sugar industry
entirely by enhancing its competitiveness in the global market.
</P>
<P>
The country's sugar industry has been in a crisis after sugar
prices continued slumping since last October. Farmgate price per
bag (50 kg) of raw sugar plummeted from 900 pesos in February 1995
to less than 500 early this year, resulting in great economic
losses to sugar planters and millers.
</P>
<P>
The plunge in sugar prices was caused by a glut of sugar supply
in the domestic market due to over-importation of refined sugar
last year, according to the SRA.

Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Japan.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Refutes "Exploitation of Xinjiang" (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A State Planning Commission
spokesman refuted as "groundless" a report forwarded by the United
Nations Center for Human Rights which said the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region has to turn in large amounts of petroleum and
grain to the central government.
</P>
<P>
According to a letter from the UN center, Xinjiang has to hand
in 80 million tons of petroleum and 40 million tons of grain to
the central government during the country's Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000) period.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that for a long time the central government
has gone all out to support economic and social development in
areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups, and offered a series of
preferential treatment in their fiscal revenue and the arrangement
of investment projects there.
</P>
<P>
As one of China's five autonomous regions inhabited by national
minorities, the spokesman noted, economic and social development
in Xinjiang has always received great support from the central
government.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1995, the region made use of an investment 66
billion yuan in its capital construction, with 55.9 billion yuan
from the state. The proportion of state investment in Xinjiang is
much higher than the country's average.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a total of 19.24 billion yuan of capital
construction investment went to Xinjiang, including 13.85 billion
from the state, suggesting a proportion much higher than that in
other places of the country.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang's economy developed faster than ever during the
1990-95 period, the spokesman said, adding that the state will
continue arranging a great sum of investment into Xinjiang's
infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the central government dispatched
at least 200,000 tons of grain to Xinjiang annually before
1985. With the backing of the central government after 1985,
Xinjiang developed very rapidly in its grain production and was
able to achieve grain self-sufficiency. Some places have even been
faced with the difficulty in grain sales.
</P>
<P>
To protect the interest of local farmers, the central budget
even allocated special funds to purchase the surplus grains that
the farmers were willing to sell at a price higher than market
price, and stored them on site as preparations for a bad year, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, for instance, the central government issued orders of
purchasing 100,000 tons of wheat and 175,000 tons of corn for
storage right after a good harvest in Xinjiang, which protected
the interest of the farmers.
</P>
<P>
It is out of ulterior motives to distort such practices aimed
at protecting the interest of farmers into forcing Xinjiang to
offer grain to the central government, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> China Refutes "Exploitation of Xinjiang" (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The spokesman pointed out that the country's support to the
region to exploit oil and gas is aimed at playing up local
resource advantages so as to promote economic and social
development in the region.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Xinjiang produced some 14 million tons of crude oil,
most of which was processed and used in the region. The processed
products first satisfied local needs for oil products and chemical
materials.
</P>
<P>
The remaining crude oil and processed oil products were sold in
 other places of the country to fulfill its commercial value.
</P>
<P>
Everyone with common economic sense should know that commodity
circulation can not be limited by natural or administrative
regions, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang's selling a proportion of oil to other places was not
only a support to the whole country but also the needs of local
economic development, he said, adding that such regular market
economic activity was beyond reproach.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman told the reporter that every year the country
arranges help-the-poor funds to promote economic development in
poverty-stricken areas in the region.
</P>
<P>
This year, the country has allocated some 685 million yuan into
such funds. An amount of 3.5 billion yuan will go to Xinjiang in
the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the country allocated another 600 million yuan for a
1995-97 project to improve drinking water facilities in rural
areas in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman pointed out that for quite some time, some people
in the international community, in the name of protecting human
rights, have been maliciously attacking China and sowing
dissension among Chinese nationalities with fabricated and
distorted cases.
</P>
<P>
"Their plot will never succeed, " he said.

<HEADLINE> France Opposes Partial Publication of Archives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- France today expressed its wish
that the gold of Jews robbed by the Nazis during World War II will
be returned to their owners rapidly, but said it opposes "partial
publication" of the archives concerning this question.
</P>
<P>
"Our concern... is to return this gold in serenity and with
celebrity," French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that according to a tripartite commission on Nazi gold
set up in 1945 by Britain, the United States and France, out of
the 337 tons of Jewish gold robbed by Germany, the whereabout of
5.5 tons of the gold remained unknown.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Brussels-based tripartite commission should
now "work with serenity" in investigating the whereabout of the
gold.
</P>
<P>
"Rather than making partial publication of the archives of the
commission, we support the opening of these archives as soon as
the tripartite commission has done their work," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has asked for publication now of the
archives.
</P>
<P>
France has set up its own commission to investigate the
whereabout of Nazi gold in France and other Jewish properties
robbed during World War II in order to return them to their
original owners.
</P>
<P>
The World Jewish Congress and the Representative Council of
Jewish Institutions in France have asked the members of the
tripartite commission, in particular France, to investigate the
whereabout of the gold, part of which is now reportedly stocked in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that a solution that complies with the law and equity
will be elaborated," said the spokesman.

HELSINKI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Finnish Foreign Ministry decided
today to provide one million Finish Marks (about 200,000
U.S.dollars) worth of humanitarian aid to Albania to help it
overcome its current political crisis.
</P>

Pekka Haavisto, a senior official in charge of foreign aid, said

He expressed fear that European countries would bear the brunt

crisis could not be properly handled.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Finnish Red Cross will also dispatch a medical
expert to Albania who will stay there for at least three months.
</P>
<P>
Besides Albania, Finland recently also donated half a million
marks to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to help flood
victims and 250,000 marks to Iran following an earthquake.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The number of cholera victims
is increasing in the Lower Shabelle region of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Wanlewein District, 90 km south of Mogadishu,
said more than 300 people have died of cholera in the region
since last month.
</P>
<P>
According to Mohamed Haji Qasim, the Chairman of the newly-set
up Cholera Committee in Lower Shabelle, seven people
died of the disease yesterday in Wanlewein.
</P>
<P>
According to the committee, the World Health Organisation and
an Italian aid agency, CISP, have so far responded to the plight
of the cholera-hit people in the region. The CISP has offered 100
litters of solution to the victims of the disease, while WHO is
also offering oral rehydration solutions and essential drugs.
</P>
<P>
However, the committee said the medicines are far less than
required.
</P>
<P>
The committee urged the aid agencies to quickly intervene in
the desperate situation of the Somalia people. enditem

<HEADLINE> US Peace Broker Leaves for Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
today dispatched its chief Middle East peace broker Dennis Ross to
Morocco for talks with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat to halt
violence triggered by Israelis breaking ground for Jewish housing
construction in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Ross' mission is to stop strong Palestinian opposition, which
might evolve into violence, to obvious violations by the Israeli
government of Israeli-Palestinian agreements.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government, defying worldwide criticism of its
decision to build 6,500 Jewish homes in traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem, has vowed to push forward with its construction plans.
</P>
<P>
The United States, placating the Palestinians with some oral
criticism of the Israeli decision, has twice vetoed U.N. Security
Council resolutions condemning Isreal's construction decision.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright wrote
a letter to Arafat urging him to refrain Palestinians from taking
any violent actions against Israelis, tantamount to say the
Palestinians should sit by to watch Israelis doing whatever they
like in defiance of any peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
It was said Ross will seek, first of all, a clear statement
from Arafat to halt attacks on Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, a suicide bomber killed three women in a Tel Aviv
cafe and injured scores of others.
</P>
<P>
Ross will first meet Arafat in Rabat, Morocco, then fly to
Israel to urge Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to ease
tensions. He will try to persuade Arafat and Netanyahu to open
negotiations over the future of the West Bank and Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Confers with Gore on Principles Guiding Sino-US Ties (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin told
visiting US Vice-President Al Gore here today that healthy and
stable Sino-US relations toward the 21st century should be based
on three principles: adherence to common interests,
farsightedness, and a proper handling of the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
"In the new situation, the need for the two countries to
maintain and expand cooperation is not dwindling, but growing
continuously," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
In particular, there exist very great, cooperative potentials
for the two countries to jointly safeguard global and regional
peace, develop bilateral economic and trade ties, and promote the
growth and prosperity of the world economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Governments of the two countries and their leaders should have
a full understanding about this. And what's more, people of both
countries should reach such a consensus.
</P>
<P>
"One should stand higher and see farther while dealing with
Sino-US relations," the Chinese President said, quoting a poem
from Wang Anshi, a well-known reformer in Song Dynasty (960-1279),
"Unafraid of floating clouds blocking eyesight, because you at the
pinnacle."
</P>
<P>
"We should dispel all interferences and noises in Sino-US
relations, stand higher and see farther, get a firm hold of the
fundamental interests of the peoples of the two countries, and
keep in mind the overall situation of bilateral relations, the
whole world situation as well as the endeavor to bring into the
21st century a prosperous, stable and peaceful world," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Concerning differences on some issues, they can be resolved on
the basis of mutual respect, non-interference in each other's
internal affairs, and equal consultations. And if some differences
cannot be resolved for the time being, the two sides can seek
common ground while reserving differences, but they cannot meddle
in the overall situation in developing relations between the two
countries, he noted.

<P>
NEW YORK, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A small private jet smashed into
a maintenance truck parked on the runway at La Guardia airport,
New York, Tuesday, forcing cancellation of flights throughout the
day in New York and at airports nationwide.
</P>
<P>
In the incident which occurred early in the morning, the small
two-engine plane, with four people on board, crashed into a white
Port Authority truck, narrowly missing two workers who had been
given clearance to change bulbs in the runway lights, said a New
York Times report today.
</P>
<P>
The incident caused the closure of the entire airport for about
one and half hour, forced the cancellation of 80 lights and
delayed the plans of thousands of passengers throughout the day in
New York and all airports nationwide. Emergency vehicles quickly
encircled the jet, spraying foam to prevent the fuel from
igniting.
</P>
<P>
Officials marveled that there were no injuries. The incident is
still under investigation.

<TEXT>
<P>
With regard to the proper handling of the Taiwan issue, Jiang
Zemin said that the kernel content of the three Sino-US joint
communiques is precisely one to define the guiding principle for
dealing with the issue.
</P>
<P>
The United States had made solemn commitment on the Taiwan
question. But in the history of the development of Sino-US
relations, the issue has experienced repeated hindrances, which
even undermined the process of improving and developing Sino-US
relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have talked about the topic time and again, just in a hope
that it would not affect the smooth growth of Sino-US ties any
more," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang welcomed the US Vice-President on his first trip to
China, and said that Gore has come at a time when Sino-US ties
have entered into an important period. Gore held in-depth and
friendly talks with Premier Li Peng Tuesday on Sino-US relations
and world issues of mutual concern, and both were present at the
Sino-US Forum on environment and development, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told Gore that "I wish your current visit will help
increase your understanding of China." Gore said that he was
pleased to have the opportunity to meet Jiang again.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the US administration, he expressed deep grief
over the loss of Deng Xiaoping, and conveyed to Jiang the regards
of US President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Gore said President Clinton welcomes Jiang to pay a state visit
to the United States later this year, and Jiang expressed his
thanks for this and thanked Gore for the condolences he conveyed
at the Chinese embassy in Washington after Deng's death.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin also asked Gore to forward his regards to Clinton,
adding that he is looking forward to meeting Clinton again and he
welcomes Clinton's visit to China.
</P>
<P>
"Although Comrade Deng Xiaoping has left us, we will
unswervingly advance the great cause of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics, which was initiated by him," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping had attached great importance to Sino-US
relations and had made historic and significant contributions in
forging diplomatic ties between the two countries and improving
bilateral relations, Jiang noted.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jiang Confers with Gore on Principles Guiding Sino-US Ties (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reviewing the growth of Sino-US relations in the past 25 years,
Jiang said that despite twists and turns, Sino-US ties as a whole
have scored relatively great expansion on the basis of three
Sino-US joint communiques.
</P>
<P>
With joint efforts of both sides, the two countries have
achieved some positive progress in their relations in recent
years, and they are facing chances for further improvement and
development, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, there still exist some problems and difficulties which
need to be dealt with appropriately, and some new interferences
and hindrances are yet to be removed, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his conviction that as long as they proceed from
the fundamental interests of the peoples in the two countries and
from the overall situation of safeguarding world peace, the two
sides can dispel all interferences and Sino-US relations will
maintain long-term stability and development
</P>
<P>
Gore said he took joy in his two-day visit and was pleased with
a wide range of talks with Premier Li Peng and other Chinese
leaders over the past two days.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the talks had enhanced his belief that
the US and China must increase cooperation in bilateral relations
and on regional and international issues, and they should have
frequent contacts at varying levels, increase their exchanges, and
expand their common understanding.
</P>
<P>
Also participating in today's meeting were Chen Jinhua,
minister in charge of the State Planning Commission, Liu Huaqiu,
director of the Foreign Affairs Office under the State Council, Li
Daoyu, Chinese Ambassador to the US, and Li Zhaoxing, Chinese
vice-foreign minister, and James Sasser, US Ambassador to China.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, Mozambique Sign Landmines Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Mozambique
signed an agreement today, confirming both sides's commitment to a ban
on anti-personnel landmines.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo and his Mozambican
counterpart Leonardo signed the agreement in Lome, Togo,
according to the South African Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, both South Africa and Mozambique will ban
the use of anti-personnel landmines in their respective countries.
</P>
<P>
It could be regarded as "another watershed event" in the
relations between South Africa and Mozambique, the ministry
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
With the announcement of banning anti-personnel landmines, the
two countries affirmed their parntership in the campaign for
a mine-free southern Africa and in the international campaign to
ban landmines, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
According to the South African Press Association (SAPA), about
two million landmines had been scattered in Mozambique, posing
the biggest threat to the reconstruction and development underway
in that country.
</P>
<P>
Lifting the mines in Mozambique was of mutual benefit, but in
particular it would help Mozambican citizens stimulate the
important agricultural sector, SAPA said. enditem

<HEADLINE> EU to Enhance Support for Poor Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Union will enhance
support to heavily indebted poor countries in Africa, the Caribbean
and the Pacific (ACP).
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, EU's executive body, today adopted a
proposal for enhanced support to poor ACP nations. The proposal
was presented by Joao de Deus Pinheiro, EU commissioner for
development and external relations with ACP states.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was made in the HIPC Debt initiative, a program of
action to alleviate the debt problems of the heavily indebted poor
countries.
</P>
<P>
The initiative, endorsed at the 1996 annual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Washington , "is
a unique opportunity for the international community to assist the
poorest" countries in the world, said Pinheiro.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, EU would provide additional structural
adjustment assistance, financing of debt repayment and expertise
on debt management.
</P>
<P>
Pinheiro said that EU, as a major development partner of ACP
countries, has an important role to play in this initiative.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Urges Zairean Warring Sides to Cease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOME, March 26 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Koffi Annan
today appealed to the warring parties of Zaire to cease fire and
"move to the negotiating table" to solve their conflict.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal in his speech at the special summit of the
Organization of African Unity on the Zaire crisis, which was
opened here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that he strongly endorses the call of the Nairobi
Summit II that the warring parties should cease hostilities and
create the necessary environment to facilitate a negotiated
settlement to the Zaire crisis.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief arrived at the capital of Togo from Angola
yesterday to attend the two-day summit, at which 30 African
countries are represented.
</P>
<P>
Annan stressed that Zaire and its people must move forward on a
clear path towards lasting peace and reconstruction based on
democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights.
</P>
<P>
"But before that can happen, the fighting must stop and a
dialogue must begin among Zaireans," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stated that the United Nations will continue to press the
two sides so that they, "without further delay", accept total
cessation of hostilities and commence negotiations.
</P>
<P>
But the secretary general noted that effective peace-making
and conflict resolution in the Great Lakes region must embrace the
broadest humanitarian, social and economic dimensions, because
military might or intevention alone cannot successfully lay the
fountations for lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his speech, he asked Africans not to shelter
behind narrow nationalism because the sufferings of any African
affect all Africans.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that "African unity is the key" as Africa does not
command great arsenals. "But African unity can be a strong moral
force. When Africa speaks with one voice, the world listens," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The summit, chaired by President of Cameroun Paul Biya who is also
chairman of the OAU, will focus its discussions on what a mechanism
should be established to ensure the implementation of a five-point
peace plan in the war-torn Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko's delegation, which is led by
Vice President of parliament Boboliko, and a two-member delegation of
rebel leader Laurent Kabila are in the Togolese capital for the
summit.
</P>
<P>
The African leaders are now holding closed-door meetings and
will issue a communique at the end of the summit tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Germany Turns Tough on Sending Back Bosnian Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Interior ministers from Germany's 16
federal states today decided to carry on the implementation of a
plan to send back Bosnian refugees living in the country.
</P>
<P>
Up from May 1, Germany will repatriate not only single people,
childless couples and Bosnians with a criminal record in Germany,
but also those refugees with families, thus starting the so-called
second phase of the repatriation plan, ministers said.
</P>
<P>
Those refugees who are receiving medical treatment in Germany,
or students who began their education in Germany before January
26, 1996 are allowed to stay in the country temporarily. Bosnian
refugees who plan to move to the United States, Canada or
Australia from Germany are also allowed to stay until their
departure.
</P>
<P>
The decision followed the deportation of 41 Bosnian refugees
Tuesday, which was the first relatively large-scale repatriation
of Bosnian refugees from Germany this year.
</P>
<P>
Uneasy with the heavy financial burden of hosting refugees,
estimated at 3 billion U.S. dollars a year, German local
authorities have mounted increasing pressure on the 320,000
predominantly Muslim Bosnian war refugees living in the country to
return home voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have cut some social security payments and
insisted that the overall Bosnian refugee population in Germany be
reduced by some 80,000 before summer.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Sells 30 Percent of State-owned Telkom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
today signed an agreement to sell 30 percent equity stake of
state-owned telecommunication corporation Telkom to two foreign
consortium, the United States-based SBC International and Telkom
Malaysia Berhard.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Midrand, north of Johannesburg, Posts,
Telecommunications and Broadcasting Minister Jay Naidoo said the 1.26
billion US Dollar deal represented the single largest direct foreign
investment in South Africa to date and the beginning of the
implementation of the government's restructuring program for
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the injection of foreign currency to the country's
reserves, Telkom would also be committed to 53 billion Rand (about
11.7 billion US Dollar) capital expenditure over the next five-year
period, almost doubling the current program, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The deal would probably provide a significant boost to the South
African economy and a creation of 50,000 new jobs, both in
telecommunications and supporting industries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, SBC International and Telkom Malaysia Berhard promised
to install 2.7 million new telephone lines and 120,000 pay phones over
the next five-year period.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki also announced that the
government would inject one billion US Dollar into Telkom to help fund
the infrastructure expansion program. enditem

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official Hopes Ross' Mission to Solve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 26 (Xinhua) -- As U.S. Middle East peace envoy
Dennis Ross is returning to the Middle East on a rescue mission,
a senior Palestinian official expressed the hope today that the
U.S. intervention could solve the current crisis on the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Abu Ala (or Ahmed Queria), Speaker of the Palestinian
Council (PC), was quoted by Israel Radio as saying that either
the U.S. direct intervention or the international arbitration
could solve the deepening crisis between Israel and the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that the ball was in Israel's court, and
the Israeli government had to decide whether it wanted to
continue the peace process or not.
</P>
<P>
Ross is expected to travel to Rabat, capital of Morocco,
Thursday, where he will hold a meeting with PNA President Yasser
Arafat who has decided to cut short his current Asian tour in
order to meet Ross.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Arafat, Ross will fly on to Israel to
hold talks with Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu. Then
he will go back to Washington Friday to report to President
Bill Clinton the results of the meetings.
</P>
<P>
Ross is facing a tougher task this time in his attempt to
restart the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations
because of the wide gap between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, both sides have been critical of the U.S. stance on
the ongoing crisis.
</P>
<P>
Israel has demanded the PNA clearly renounce what it called
"the tactics of violence" and strengthen its crackdown on
extremism, while the PNA insisted on Israel's suspension of
settlement activities, especially the construction on Har Homa
of southeastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. criticized Israel for making the Har Homa
settlement decision, it nevertheless vetoed a United Nations
Security Council draft resolution which urged the Jewish state to
abandon the Har Homa project. Israel rejected the U.S. criticism
and went ahead with the Har Homa construction last week.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side at the same time denounced the U.S. veto
of the U.N. resolution as an act of encouraging Israel to build
the settlement in East Jerusalem before the final-status talks
begin. In recent demonstrations, Palestinian protesters poured out
their anger by burning both Israeli and the U.S. flags.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a war of words between Israeli and Palestinian
officials continued today, with both accusing each other of
violating the peace accords and jeopardizing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Illan, media adviser to Netanyahu, slammed Arafat
for playing the card of terrorism in dealing with Israel.
</P>
<P>
On the question regarding the peace march, he said, "I can
promise that it will not work this time. This government has made
it very clear that it will not work. We will not tolerate
violence, we will not see violence as part of the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Ross' mediation tour, Bar-Illan said Israel
hoped him to relay a clear message to Arafat that he should make
a decision "once for all" to renounce violence and solve all
differences through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
In his counter-charges, Chief Palestinian Negotiator Saeb
Erekat warned that Israel's moves to expand settlements were
threatening to kill the peace march.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that it was the Israeli government that had incited
the recent wave of violence by going ahead with the Har Homa
project in defiance of widespread condemnations and warnings of
violence.
</P>
<P>
Erekat, critical of the U.S. partial stance favoring Israeli in
mediating the peace process, hoped that Ross would persuade the
Netanyahu government to stop settlement activities and come back
to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
He added that Ross should concentrate his efforts on the
substance of the peace process instead of only bringing
the talks on track. He warned that "the idea of peace is dying
away" because of Israel's refusal to implement precisely and
honestly the peace agreements.

<P>
HARARE, March 26 (Xinhua) -- More businesses are increasingly
realising the growing importance of environmental issues with
membership for the Environment Forum of Zimbabwe (EFZ) having
grown by 25 percent to 100 companies.
</P>
<P>
EFZ Chairman Pat Rooney today said while some members were
relative newcomers to environmental management and had joined to
enhance their commitment, knowledge and environmental stewardship,
many others had made substantial progress.
</P>
<P>
''Some of their programmes have already resulted in significant
improvements covering aspects such as better usage of raw materials,
cleaner production, minimisation of waste, reduced pollution, and
less harm to the environment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said environmental issues were internationally becoming more
contentious and a conditionality in trade, investment and economic
and business development. ''Consequently, environmental management
is now part of total quality management practice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, EFZ Executive Director Jim Harrower said there were
also plans to start a regional business environmental association
which would be tasked with putting in place environmeental programmes
and legislation in the Southern African Development Community member
countries. enditem

<HEADLINE> China Will Stick to Policy of Opening, Reform: Qiao Shi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress of China, said here
today that China will stick to its policy of opening and reform.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with representatives of France's national
employers' association, the CNPF, and the France-China Committee,
Qiao said that the internal political situation of China is stable
and China's policy of opening and reform will not change.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese Communist Party will hold its 15th
Congress in the latter half of this year, and it will better
implement the policies and lines that have already been decided.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is continuously improving its environment
for foreign enterprises to make investment, in order to create a
very favorable condition for carrying out economic cooperation and
exchanges with all countries of the world.
</P>
<P>
On questions concerning China's application for membership of
the World Trade Organization, Qiao said that China intends to
protect its own industry, but it does not mean that it will close
its door, because to protect China own industry falls within the
scale of the overall development of the country.
</P>
<P>
On Sino-French economic relations, Qiao said that China wishes
that Sino-French trade can be maintained with an overall balance,
and that French export products to and technological cooperation
projects with China place a greater emphasis on high technological
quality.
</P>
<P>
He said that many French enterprises are having successful
business in China because they pay great importance to the high
technological quality of their projects.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that French products have a greater competitive power.
High technological quality and great competitive power should be
the aims of all enterprises," he added.
</P>
<P>
Qiao also expressed his confidence that China and France can
achieve the goal of having greater bilateral economic cooperation
and that Sino-French friendship will develop continuously.

<HEADLINE> Toyota to Sell Low Emission Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Toyota, the leading auto maker
of Japan, is to introduce a hybrid electric-and-gasoline power
system for cars that it says doubles fuel efficiency and cuts
emissions 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the Wall Street Journal today, the
system combines a gasoline engine, an electric motor and
nickel-metal hydride battery on a single power train. The gasoline
engine supplies the main power to drive the wheels. But the
electric battery and electric generator can also power the
electric motor. The hybrid system will go on sale in Japan this
year, it said.
</P>
<P>
A number of auto makers have been experimenting with them, the
paper said, and a few years ago, Ford Motor Co. had a test fleet
of hybrid-powered vans operating in California.
</P>
<P>
It also reported that the Audi AG unit of Germany's Volkswagen
AG has also developed hybrid power systems.
</P>
<P>
Toyota said it will aim the hybrid system at the mass market.
Its success will depend in large part on the price, still
unannounced. It appears to have resolved other major barriers
impeding the wide use of low-emission vehicles: short battery
life and limited power.
</P>
<P>
The electric battery in the hybrid won't ever need special
recharging under normal circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The first hybrid car will have a 1.5-liter engine, about the
size of the engine in the Toyota Corolla. But the company said
the car will run about twice as far on a tank of gas as the
Corolla, which gets about 18 miles a gallon.

a U.S. embargo.
</P>

annually 40 million U.S. dollars or more in Iran and Libya, which
are regarded by the U.S. as countries supporting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The director said that the TPC is the third largest
petrochemical plant in the country after the Bandar Iman
(Khomeini) Complex at the Gulf and the Arak Complex in central
Iran.
</P>
<P>
With an annual capacity of 500,000 tonnes of different
polymers, he said, the TPC is the second plant in the Middle
East to manufacture expandable polystyrene. The other one is in
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
"The main objective for setting up the TPC is expected to
produce various petrochemical products, including more than
300,000 tonnes of polystyrene and polyethylene substances,
applied industrial parts as well as household appliances as
plastic covers," he said.
</P>
<P>
The project, which started in 1989 and is to be inaugurated
soon by President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, has a budget of 1
billion dollars and a large sum of local currency.
</P>
<P>
The output of the complex is initially used for domestic
consumption but may later even reach the export level, the
director said, adding that the TPC will drastically increase the
supply and decrease the need for petrochemical imports.
</P>
<P>
Sedghi noted that the work on the TPC was mainly by Iranian
experts with the cooperation of foreign firms from Belgium,
Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and South
Korea, which were mainly in charge of design and provision of
related equipment.
</P>
<P>
Iran, the fourth largest oil producer and second largest oil
exporter in the world, pumps out 3.6 million barrels per day
(bpd) and exports 2.5 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
Iran has 16 petrochemical plants with an annual capacity of 11
million tonnes of various products, which bring about about 500
million dollars to the country.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Oil Ministry predicted that Iran would export 14
million tonnes of petrochemical products by the turn of the
century.

<HEADLINE> Arab Countries to Unify Actions on Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Arab foreign ministers will adopt a
unified stance on dealing with the Israeli settlement policy and
seeking international support to boost the Palestinian cause, a
senior Palestinian official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Head of the PLO Political Department Farouk Kaddoumi told
reporters that the joint Arab action strategy on the Israeli
settlement policy in Arab East Jerusalem tops the agenda of the
Arab League (AL) Council meeting scheduled for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Other topics of the Arab foreign ministers' 107th session are
means of pooling support for the Palestinian intifada (uprising),
Palestinian refugees and the recent developments of situation on
the Palestinian lands, said Kaddoumi during a stopover here on his
way to Morocco for the Jerusalem Committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian-Israeli relations have deteriorated as Israel went
ahead with the 6,500-unit housing project in Abu Ghneim, or Har
Homa, in East Jerusalem where Palestinians hope to create a
capital.
</P>
<P>
Israel seized East Jerusalem in the 1967 war and wants the
entire city to remain undivided under Israeli sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
In a desperate move against the Israeli settlement construction
in East Jerusalem, a militant Palestinian carried out a suicide
bombing attack in a Tel Aviv cafe last Friday, killing three women
and wounding 48 other.
</P>
<P>
This was the latest fatal incident by the Palestinians to
avenge on the Israeli building operations. Observers say more
similar attacks are feared to come.
</P>
<P>
The incidents in the occupied Palestinian territories are a
"natural reaction to Israel's repressive and provocative policies
and its continuation with building settlements," Kaddoumi said.
</P>
<P>
"What the Palestinian people are doing are self-defense and in
defense of the peace process that is crumbling," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Israel is trying to impose a new fait accompli on Jerusalem,
This attitude actually undermines stability in the region and
leads it back to violence," he added.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting with AL Secretary General Esmat Abdel
Meguid today, the PLO official said they discussed issues to be
tabled on the AL council meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meguid has said earlier that Arab foreign ministers will take
up support of the Palestinian Intifada (uprising) as "one of the
major props against the Israeli arrogance" on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumi is heading for Rabat to attend the Jerusalem
Committee meeting, which is expected to map out an executive
mechanism for shelving normalization with Israel.
</P>
<P>
A plan prepared by the PNA, Egypt and Saudi Arabia calls upon
all the Arab and Islamic countries to immediately freeze their
relations with Israel, withdraw from any economic or trade
projects in which Israel is a partner and suspend bilateral and
multilateral cooperation with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The plan, to be forwarded to the Rabat meeting, also urges the
establishment of a 1-billion-dollar fund to protect Islamic
holy sites in Jerusalem from being purchased by Jewish settlers.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein to Play Constructive Role, Says CBI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of British
Industry (CBI) and the Irish Republic Army's political wing Sinn
Fein have recently met to discuss political and economic issues.
</P>
<P>
The CBI defended its decision to meet Sinn Fein officials,
claiming they represented a significant proportion of the
population in Northern Ireland and that the meeting was part of a
discussion of the province's political and economic problems.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the two parties met several times during
the IRA cease-fire and at least once since the collapse of the
cease-fire in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
Bill Tosh of the Northern Ireland CBI said in a TV interview
that Sinn Fein had a good insight into some of the problems
affecting some communities in Northern Ireland and that it had a
constructive role to play in economic regeneration.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed claims that the CBI should not talk with Sinn Fein
and denied their political role led directly to Northern Ireland's
economic problems.
</P>
<P>
Tosh said issues such as long-term unemployment and the
economic regeneration of inner cities and deprived rural areas
were discussed, as well as the current political situation and the
general election.
</P>
<P>
Mitchel McLaughlin, Sinn Fein's chairman, said the party had
been involved in a "useful and constructive exchange" with the CBI
and they had also been able to give their own opinion of the
political situation.
</P>
<P>
"Our discussions centered on a number of issues, including the
growth challenge, inward investment and unemployment," he added.
</P>
<P>
Caoimhghin O'Caolin, a member of the Sinn Fein, who was at the
meeting said, "We looked in particular at how disadvantaged areas,
like the border counties, could be regenerated."

<HEADLINE> German FM: Turkey's Bid for EU Not to Be Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel said here today that Turkey's bid for joining the
European Union (EU) would not be rejected, but Ankara will
have to wait for the club membership.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel, who arrived here late Wednesday night for a two-day
visit, made the remarks this afternoon at a joint press
conference with his Turkish counterpart Tansu Ciller following
their official talks.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel, also deputy prime minister, said: "The Turkish train
remains on the main track, it will not be put on the side track".
But he ruled out the possibility of Turkey's accession into the EU
in the short term.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has a series of problems to be sorted out before being
admitted into the EU, said Kinkel, adding: "Turkey will not be
able to become a member of the European Union in the near future
due to human rights, Kurdish issue, dispute with Greece and some
economic questions."
</P>
<P>
Ankara vowed to veto the NATO expansion process if its
full EU membership bid failed, claiming that the two processes
were directly linked, which was termed as "blackmail" by
Germany.
</P>
<P>
Turkey was greatly angered by a March 4 statement by the
EU Christian Democrats who called Turkey's membership application
unacceptable due to its religious culture.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel was close to calling off his visit at last minute
because of media reports quoting Turkish Islamist Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan as saying that he should come to Turkey with
his head bowed.
</P>
<P>
The German foreign minister, accompanied by a 75-member
delegation including businessmen, press, officials and
parliamentarians, postponed his visit to Ankara for two hours.
</P>
<P>
"No European will have to bow their head to Turkey in
shame, " Kinkel told the press on the first day of an
official visit to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
However, before meeting with Kinkel today, Erbakan said that
the gathering of the representatives from the two countries is a
satisfying event, adding: "the development of the bilateral ties
between Turkey and Germany not only attaches great importance to
the peace in Europe, but also to the world peace."
</P>
<P>
Before meeting the members of the Foreign Relations Commission
of the Turkish parliament, Kinkel said that Turkey's relations
with Europe should be maintained in a calm atmosphere and over 2
million Turkish citizens living in Germany contributed a lot to
the German economy.
</P>
<P>
German businessmen in the delegation are expected to hold
contacts with Turkish private sector representatives and
ministries responsible for economic and technical issues in
addition to seeking for cooperation facilities.

<HEADLINE> Togo Urges Concrete Measures to Stop Wars in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOME, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Togolese President Gnassingbe
Eyadema said here today that African countries must take concrete
measures to stop wars which are afflicting their poor continent.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a grand opening ceremony for the first
extraordinary session of heads of states and government of the
Central Organ of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution to
seek a peaceful solution to the Zairean crisis.
</P>
<P>
"It is a must for us to take concrete measures to stop the
bleeding caused by wars which are weakening Africa, breeding
sentiments of hatred and are likely to lead to the dismemberment
of the Organization of African Unity," said Eyadema.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the special summit for the quest of solution to the
conflict which is tearing the Great Lakes region is "highly
crucial for the safeguard of the African unity", he noted in his
speech.
</P>
<P>
The Togolese president warned that the situation in the region
is "seriously alarming" and the devastations of war in eastern
Zaire are likely to "cause the explosion of the whole Africa."
</P>
<P>
"Our continent is faced with conflicts, disasters, threats and
refugee movements it never witnessed before," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the time has come for Africa to take its destiny into its
own hands so that the OAU could efficiently apply the mechanism
for the prevention, management and settlement of conflicts, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"This extraordinary summit to seek solutions to the crisis in
the Great Lakes region is a big challenge that we must take up"
to demonstrate "our political maturity and our genuine
willingness for peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Eyadema expressed his optimism about a negotiated
settlement to the Zairean conflict, "because there is never a
problem without a solution."
</P>
<P>
He called on the conflicting parties to show a sense of good
will so that in forgiveness, tolerance and reconciliation, a
peaceful solution can be found.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen African heads of state are attending the two-day
summit with 30 African countries and two warring sides of Zaire
represented. OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim, United
Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and representatives of the
United States, Britain, France, Germany and the European Union
were also present.

<HEADLINE> Ban On Use Of DDT Reiterated In Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania Government
has reiterated that the DDT pesticide is banned and that anyone
found formulating, manufacturing or using it will face court
charges.
</P>

subsequent pesticide control regulations of 1984, anyone
convicted of violating the laws is liable to a fine of 3,000
Tanzanian Shillings or three months of imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
DDT is still rampantly used in Morogoro, Kilimanjaro and other
regions despite the ban and relevant health implications.

<HEADLINE> Pesticide Distribution Insufficient, Irregular in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Agriculture
of Ethiopia announced here today that pesticides are not reaching
farmers in sufficient amounts and the ministry is contacting
importers and distributors to look for solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the Ethiopian News Agency, Baten
Kabeto, head of Agricultural Development and Crop Protection
Department in the ministry, said shortage of pesticides and weed
killers is prevalent currently in most rural areas throughout the
country owing to irregularities in the supply and distribution of
the chemicals.
</P>
<P>
He said importers and distributors of pesticides do not
directly provide services to rural areas and their activities are
confined to capital Addis Ababa and some other urban centers
alone.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture was discussing the issue with
entrepreneurs engaged in the sector with a view to making farmers
in all areas beneficiaries of pesticides and weed killer
supplies, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier report, the ministry said last week
that the country had the capacity to ward off any resurgency of
pest, with 225,000 liters of pesticides distributed by the
central government and 458,000 liters stored by regions.
</P>
<P>
There are 26 importers of pesticides and weed killers
operating in the country.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Court Rejects Appeals of Three Egyptian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's federal supreme
court announced today that it has dismissed appeals by the three
Egyptian terrorists sentenced to death for an attempt on the life
of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's federal high court sentenced to death in September
1996 Soufit Hassen Abdulkeni, Abdulkerim Alnadi Abduradi and
Alarabi Sadit Hafez after they were proved guilty of the
assassination attempt on President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, the federal supreme
court said it has dismissed the appeals the three terrorists made
against the death penalty they were given after a thorough
examination of the case.
</P>
<P>
The terrorists in their appeals said the prosecution did not
prove that they have committed the crime and their involvement in
the assassination attempt on President Mubarak, the court said.
</P>
<P>
The terrorists, the court said, were operating according to
orders from the leadership of Gama-Al-Islamia, whose members they
are, until the time the attempt was made on the life of the
president.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the gravity of the crime they committed, they
were also responsible for the death of two individuals and the
injury two others sustained, it said.
</P>
<P>
The type of arms they used and the weapons they had in store
coupled with the highly organized criminal act was a tangible
proof to the dangerous condition, the court added.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Women Protest Over Israeli Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- About 50 women from the Egyptian
trade unions and political parties today gathered outside the
headquarters of the Arab League (AL) here to protest against the
Israeli building of a new Jewish neighborhood in Arab East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators held banners and shouted slogans such as
"Jerusalem is Arab," demanding an emergency Arab summit
to discuss Israel's settlement policies in Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
It is the latest of a string of protests in the Egyptian
capital against the Abu Ghneim or Har Homa project and Israeli
attempts to Judaize Jerusalem, which is holy to Christians,
Muslims and Jews alike.
</P>
<P>
Cairo University students staged a two-day demonstration on
campus Monday, denouncing Israel for placing obstacles in the way
to establish peace, defending the rights of the Palestinian people
and urging the AL and the U.N. Security Council to confront
obstacles placed by Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Egyptian opposition parties have
called for holding an emergent Arab summit to tackle challenges
and hazards besetting the Arab world in light of Israel's
construction of the Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The parties, at a meeting Tuesday, also called for holding a
rally this week to denounce the Israeli settlement policy.
</P>
<P>
They also called for expelling the Israeli ambassador here
and withdrawing the Egyptian ambassador form Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Arabs are infuriated by the Israeli housing project for Jews,
which they said caused a breakdown of Palestinian-Israeli
relations.
</P>
<P>
The past six days have witnessed widespread clashes between
Palestinian stone-throwers and Israeli soldiers in the West Bank
and a fatal suicide bomb attack in a Tel Aviv cafe last Friday, in
which three women were killed and 40 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, together with the Palestinian National Authority and
Saudi Arabia, has drafted a plan that calls upon Arab and Islamic
countries to immediately freeze their relations with Israel and
suspend the Middle East multilateral cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Chernomyrdin Holds Talks With Qian Qichen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin met with Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen here this afternoon and the talks between the two
sides were held in a friendly atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Chernomyrdin expressed satisfaction with
their talks and said that the talks conducted separately by
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Foreign Minister Evgey
Primakov with Qian Qichen were fruitful.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Russia gives priority to development of the
relations of good-neighborliness, friendship and cooperation with
China in the Russian foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
The premier believed that the forthcoming visit of Chinese
President Jiang Zemin to Moscow will further promote the
relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Qian Qichen conveyed the greetings and a
letter from Chinese Premier Li Peng to Chernomyrdin. The Russian
prime minister expressed thanks for it and asked Qian to pass on
his best wishes to Premier Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said that the Russian side is actively working for
the second regular meeting with Chinese Premier Li Peng, scheduled
for the second half of May.
</P>
<P>
Qian Qichen said that the mechanism of regular meeting between
the Chinese and Russian premiers has been put into practice since
Chinese Premier Li Peng paid a visit to Moscow at the end of last
year. It has brought many good results to development of the
relations between the two countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Facts have proved, Qian said, the mechanism of regular meeting
at high level is very effective. It has important significance in
cooperation between the two countries in all fields, especially in
the fields of economy and trade, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian Qichen believed that the upcoming second regular meeting
between the premiers of the two countries will also be
successful.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders put forward the great common goal of raising the
amount of the bilateral trade volume to 20 billion U.S. dollars by
the end of this century. Qian said that it is not hard to bring
about if only the two countries make common efforts.
</P>
<P>
China intends to find out new ways of cooperation with Russia
and to extend the cooperation, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
"We encourage those companies and enterprises, which have
strength and prestige, to make straight contacts with us," Qian
Qichen noted and hoped the departments concerned of the two sides
will begin studying upon it.
</P>
<P>
Sharing this opinion of Qian Qichen, Chernomyrdin said Russia
and China must create a long-term relationship of stable trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russia wants to take part in building large
Chinese projects and will actively cooperate with China in the
fields of oil, natural gas, nuclear energy, machinery and
shipping.
</P>
<P>
The Russian side maintained that the two countries should help
supply each other's needs and gradually raise the trade volume,
Chernomyrdin said. At the same time, he said, the two governments
ought to actively open up their cooperation between some
industrial cities in the border areas.

<HEADLINE> African Leaders Call for Peace With One Voice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOME, March 26 (Xinhua) -- African leaders, gathering in the
Togolese capital for the first extraordinary summit of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) on the escalating Zairean
conflict, today called, with one voice, for peace in their
continent.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony held here today, five African leaders
who made their speeches all urged the Zaire's warring sides to
stop fighting immediately and to begin negotiations so that a
lasting peace will be brought back to their countries.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, President of Cameroun Paul Biya who is
also chairman of the OAU said African countries attach great
importance to peace in Africa and peaceful solutions to all
conflicts within the continent.
</P>
<P>
However, the peace is dangerously threatened by the crisis in
the Great Lakes region, particularly in eastern Zaire, he noted,
adding that an immediate ceasefire and direct and frank talks are
urgently needed for peace in the region and Africa as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the summit will find a way acceptable to both sides
for the implementation of the UN/OAU five-point peace plan.
</P>
<P>
The current OAU chairman also proposed that an international
conference be held to seek a complete and effective way for
resolving the conflict in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo warned that
the situation in the Great Lakes region is "seriously alarming"
and the devastations of war in eastern Zaire are likely to "cause
the explosion of the whole Africa."
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that African countries must take
"concrete measures to stop wars" which are afflicting their poor
continent.
</P>
<P>
He said:" Violence breeds violence and the escalation of
violence leads to war. War kills. War destroys. War is deadly
madness"
</P>
<P>
African countries, which are already in war against poverty,
must avoid to indulge in another war, that is the ethnic war
which is more suicidal and more deadly, he appealed.
</P>
<P>
Once more, Kenyan President Denial arap Moi reiterated the
call for a ceasefire and negotiated settlement made by the
Nairobi peace process for Zaire since the start of civil war in
Zaire, the third largest country in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The summit will provide a chance to seek a peaceful solution
to the conflict in Zaire, but it is also a real challenge, OAU
chief Salim Ahmed Salim pointed out.
</P>
<P>
However, he reaffirmed that OAU is totally committed to the
unity, stability, security and territorial integrity of Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Koffi Annan, United Nations Secretary-General who arrived here
yesterday from Angola to attend the summit, declared that the UN
will continue to press the two warring sides of Zaire in order
that, "without further delay", they accept total cessation of
hostilities and commence negotiations.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, he called for African unity which he
said "is the key and can be strong moral force".
</P>
<P>
"When Africa speaks with one voice, the world listens. But if
Africa speaks with a cacophony of confused messages, few will
listen, and no one will hear," he added.

<HEADLINE> CBI Anger With Labor's "Underhand" Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The British opposition party
Labor's efforts to show a business-friendly image were under
severe strain since the Confederation of British Industry (CBI)
described it as acting in an "underhand" way Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The row followed a disarray over Labor's plans to give unions
new recognition rights, with a judge appointed to resolve disputes
with employers.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Adair Turner, the CBI director general,
had told his colleagues that he felt "used" by the Labor Party,
which had acted in an "underhand" way by suggesting that he was a
party to its business manifesto.
</P>
<P>
Turner was "unhappy" with the way Labor has portrayed his
involvement and the implication that he has endorsed the business
manifesto, particularly as he disagreed with the section on union
recognition.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed on BBC Television's On the Record program Sunday,
Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, repeatedly emphasized that
the party's plans for business had been discussed with Turner.
</P>
<P>
Brown claimed that Turner was "happy on behalf of the CBI" to
join a working party Labor planned to set up in government to

<P>
Labor's document, he said, would "reflect two years of very
intense discussion with business about the way ahead."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from the CBI said the employers' organization had
not yet agreed to join the working party but would be "interested"
in seeing what a Labor government proposed.

<P>
"On the manifesto itself, we were in no way involved with it
and its production," he added.

<P>
Turner issued a statement Tuesday night confirming that reports
of the CBI's involvement in the Labor business manifesto had been
exaggerated and that it had seen just one paragraph.

<HEADLINE> Qatar, Oman Threaten to Sever Ties with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Qatar and Oman threatened to
break relations with Israel if the Jewish state does not give up
its policy on building a new settlement in East Jerusalem, foreign
ministers of the two countries said in the Saudi capital of
Riyadh today.
</P>
<P>
Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad Ben Jassem Bin Jaber
al-Thani told reporters that his country "would not hesitate in
severing its relations with Israel if the government of Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu continues its stubborn policy."
</P>
<P>
He said "Qatar is an Arab (country) and a GCC member state and
if Israel continues its stubborn policy we would take whatever
necessary (steps) to help our Palestinian and Syrian brothers
without hesitation."
</P>
<P>
But Sheikh Hamad also said that despite the possible
suspension of ties with Israel, his country still hopes that the
United States will succeed in changing Israel's decision
concerning the settlement.
</P>
<P>
Omani State Minister for Foreign Affairs Yusef Ben Alawi Bin
Abdallah also threatened earlier day to totally sever relations
with Israel unless Netanyahu changes his policy.
</P>
<P>
Qatar and Oman have separately opened liaison offices in
Israel since 1995, but the two GCC states suspended the activities
of the bureaux in view of Israel's latest decisions on the
settlement construction.
</P>
<P>
Israel plans to build 6,500 homes for Jews on Har Homa in Arab
East Jerusalem, which the Jewish state captured from Jordan in the
1967 Mideast War. This move has triggered strong condemnation from
the Arab and Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
Muslims consider Jerusalem the third holiest site in
Islam after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia, and Palestinians
want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future independent
state.
</P>
<P>
The GCC ministerial meeting called on Israel to back off from
the settlement decision and any other step which could change the
demographic and geographic status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
According to Kuwait News Agency reports from Riyadh, foreign
ministers of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states wrapped
up their 62nd meeting in Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the six GCC countries -- Saudi Arabia,
the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait and Bahrain --
called on the Arab and Islamic countries which have embassies or
trade offices in Israel to suspend ties with it.
</P>
<P>
They also appealed to the other countries to reconsider their
relations with Israel and adopt measures to bolster the stalemated
peace process and force the Jewish state to commit itself to
honoring the accords it signed with its Arab partners in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Qatar and Oman are the only countries in GCC that have trade
relations with Israel.

<HEADLINE> China Understands Russia's Worry About NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 26 (Xinhua) -- China completely understands
Russia's worry about the eastward expansion plans of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and hopes to see the
improvement of Russia-U.S. relations, press spokesman of the
Foreign Ministry of China Shen Guofang said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, who is accompanying Chinese Vice Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on his visit to Moscow, made the
remarks when replying to a question about China's attitude toward
the just finished Helsinki summit.
</P>
<P>
At a briefing, Shen Guofang told reporters that the development
of NATO should conform with the interests of other countries,
including Russia.
</P>
<P>
He said that China welcomes the consultations between Russia
and the United States on the NATO enlargement issue and is glad to
see the improvement of relations between them.
</P>
<P>
When asked if there is a concrete accord signed by Russia and
China on the Three Gorges project, Shen told reporters, "We
welcome the participation of Russia in the great project. Some of
the items are being considered and discussed between the Chinese
and Russian sides."
</P>
<P>
He said there is keen competition on the Three Gorges project,
and "I thought the Russian side was imbued with strong competition
since it has a solid foundation of warter and electric power."
</P>
<P>
In reply to the question on China-U.S. relations, Shen Guofang
said that relations between China and the U.S. are experiencing
trust, development and rubs.
</P>
<P>
Both China and the U.S. are great countries, Shen noted. "We
hope to keep the stable relations with the U.S. A good
relationship between the two countries would benefit world peace."
</P>
<P>
He stressed, "China will not make any concessions to the
problems concerning sovereign rights, independence and national
dignity."

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Expresses No Interest in Who to Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria said today it is not
interested in who will emerge as the winner of the May election
in Liberia under a peace accord to end the country's
seven-year-old civil war.
</P>
<P>
"It is up to Liberians to decide who will be their leaders,"
Balarabe Tafawa Balewa, special envoy of Nigerian Head of State
General Sani Abacha who is also the chairman of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS), said in Abuja, capital
of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
What Nigeria is interested in is only the restoration of peace
to that country, he said, quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria
today.
</P>
<P>
Currently, three former faction leaders -- Charles Taylor,
Alhaji Kromah and George Boley -- are widely believed to be the
strongest among those running for presidency.
</P>
<P>
According to the envoy, ECOWAS leaders are determined to abide
by the May election timetable, a position which was reiterated at
the meeting of the foreign ministers of the ECOWAS Committee of
Nine on Liberia, held in the Liberian capital of Monrovia last
month.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the envoy's words seem to be ECOWAS'
reaction to the concern expressed by the organization's
peacekeeping force, known as ECOMOG, over the slow pace of
preparations for the election scheduled for May 30.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG Force Commander Major-General Victor Malu said in
Monrovia on Tuesday that all efforts must be made to ensure that
a free and fair election be held on time after the success in the
disarmament exercise and research of hidden weapons in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Malu also allayed any fear of post-election violence or
fighting while assuring the ECOWAS authorities and the
international community that ECOMOG was in position to contain
and effectively tackle anyone who might lose the election and try
to cause problem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the envoy reiterated that Liberian refugees abroad
willing to participate in the election would be encouraged to
return under a voluntary repatriation program of the United
Nations High Commission for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are about 500,000 Liberian refugees
in neighboring countries, most of whom are in Guinea and Cote
d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
According to Malu, Liberian refugees in the two countries have
been returning in large numbers recently, encouraged by the
decision of ECOWAS allowing them to vote at home.
</P>
<P>
"With the peace process moving as scheduled, more refugees
would be encouraged to return to Liberia to contribute to the
reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts of the international
community," said the envoy.

<HEADLINE> Road to Southern Sudan Opens for Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Operation
Lifeline Sudan (OLS) today announced that roads from northern
Uganda into southern Sudan are now open for the delivery of
humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
In a news release issued here today, the OLS said that two
World Food Program (WFP) trucks carrying 40 tons of maize are
expected to arrive in Yei, southern Sudan, on March 27.
</P>
<P>
Road access to the Yei area of southern Sudan has become
possible for the first time in many years following the capture
of Yei, Kaya and Morobo along Sudan's southern border with Uganda
by the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA).
</P>
<P>
More than 16,000 people and some 1,000 prisoners of war in Yei
town are in urgent need of food and medicine as a result of the
recent fighting between the Sudan government and the SPLA, the
release noted.
</P>
<P>
The OLS pointed out that the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF)
today delivered a planeload of emergency medical and relief items
to Yambio, southern Sudan, where trucks are ready to transport
the supplies to Yei.
</P>
<P>
WFP staff in northern Uganda reported on Monday that two of
the largest Sudanese refugee camps with a total of 81,678
refugees had virtually emptied over the last week.
</P>
<P>
OLS is a consortium of U.N. agencies and more than 40
international and indigenous non-governmental organizations
working to provide emergency relief and rehabilitation for an
estimated 3.4 million war-affected civilians in southern Sudan.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Compensate Victims of Gulf War in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Minister of manpower and
Immigration Ahmed al-Amawi said today that his ministry will write
out checks compensating victims of the 1991 Gulf War throughout April.
</P>
<P>
The payment of the 58.3 million U.S. dollars will begin early
in May for 23,334 Egyptians who are to take advantage of the
first portion of the Gulf War reparations that has already reached
the Central Bank of Egypt from the United Nations Reparations Fund.
</P>
<P>
The victims are those who were forced to leave Iraq or Kuwait
during the period from August 1990 till March 1991 because of the
Gulf War, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The total of the reparations overdue for Egyptians is up to 823
million dollars and the remaining amount will be delivered later
with the continuous Iraqi oil sales.
</P>
<P>
This move came within the context of the oil-for-food deal
concluded by the U.N. and Iraq in December to allow the latter to
sell 2 billion dollars of oil in six months to ease the impact of
trade sanctions imposed on Iraq for its August 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
In line with the deal, 30 percent of the Iraqi oil sales are
to be paid to people who lost their life savings or jobs due to
the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
In the first stage, 32 billion dollars will be paid to those
who were forced to leave Iraq and Kuwait during the war.
</P>
<P>
The total of the reparations, estimated at 200 billion
dollars, will be paid out of the returns of Iraq's oil sales over
20 years.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will have access to about 1.3 billion dollars over six
months after funneling 30 percent to the fund for Gulf War
reparations and meeting other U.N. costs.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. fund is expected to take several years in examining
the papers of those who have demanded to be compensated for their
losses in the war.
</P>
<P>
In the 90 days till March 10, Iraq exported 52.3 million
barrels of oil worth an estimated 1.07 billion dollars, including
pipeline fees to Turkey.

<HEADLINE> GCC Regrets Over US Veto of UN Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The six-member Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) today expressed "deep regret" over the
U.S. veto of a U.N. draft resolution barring Israel from building
a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In a final statement issued after a two-day meeting in Saudi
capital Riyadh, the foreign ministers from the GCC states
expressed "deep regret over the U.S. veto against (of) a United
Nations Security Council draft resolution denouncing Israel's
internationally-condemned actions in East Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. twice vetoed the U.N. draft resolution demanding
Israel to stop building the new settlement in East Jerusalem
separately on March 7 and 21.
</P>
<P>
In a dispatch filed from Riyadh, the Kuwait News Agency said
that the statement expressed the GCC countries' hope that the
U.S. government would "intensify efforts to resume peace talks on
all tracks" as it is a co-sponsor of the Middle East peace
process and a friend of the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Israel's plan to build 6,500 housing units for Jews in Arab
East Jerusalem, which it captured from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
War, has sparked strong resentment from the Arab and Islamic
world.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Islamic countries criticized the U.S. for biasing
toward Israel and adopting a double-standard policy, saying that
Israel's challenge to the international community would not have
reached such an extent without the U.S. support.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the GCC ministerial meeting asked Israel to back off
from the settlement decision and any other step which could change
the demographic and geographical features of Jerusalem, the third
holiest site of Islam where the Palestinians want to establish
their capital of an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the six GCC countries -- Saudi Arabia,
the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait and Bahrain --
called on the Arab and Islamic countries which have embassies or
trade offices in Israel to suspend their ties with the country.
</P>
<P>
They also called on the other countries across the world to
reconsider their relations with Israel and adopt measures to
promote the peace process and force Israel to commit itself to
the peace accords it signed with its Arab partners in the peace
march.

<HEADLINE> GCC States Welcome Iran's Initiative to Promote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) states today welcomed Iran's recent initiative
aimed at boosting relations with its six neighbors in the
region, Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) reported from Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
This was expressed by GCC foreign ministers in their final
statement after their 62nd meeting ending this afternoon in
the Saudi capital of Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
The statement said "the council welcomes Iran's new
initiative, which was made public by Iranian Foreign Minister
Ali Akbar Velayati during his last week's tour in the region."
</P>
<P>
The GCC members also welcomed the Iranian assurances given in
various contacts with the states of the region and expressed
readiness to react positively.
</P>
<P>
The GCC was ready to react positively to these initiatives and
help build trust with Iran, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
They considered the assurances made by velayati during his
recent tour and the meeting between Saudi Crown Prince Abdallah
ibn Abdul-Aziz and Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani on the
sidelines of the just-concluded summit of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference in Islamabad, Pakistan, were indications of
Iran's willingness to improve ties with the Gulf Arab countries,
according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The GCC document added the ministers reviewed relations with
Iran based on the common will to promote them on the basis of
mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
It also underlined the need to reject to resort to force and
called for solving differences through peaceful means and in
accordance with the international law.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also reiterated the United Arab Emirates' (UAE)
sovereignty over the islands of Abu Moussa and Greater and
Lesser Tunbs in the Gulf which are currently held by Iran.
</P>
<P>
They also reaffirmed their support to all peaceful measures by
the UAE in restoring its sovereignty over the islands.
</P>
<P>
The islands issue is a key problem blocking the normalization
of relations between Iran and the GCC which groups Saudi Arabia,
the UAE, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain, besides differences in
the U.S. military existence in the Gulf region and others areas.

WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States will not
change its hardline policy toward Iraq unless there are some
changes taking place there, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at Georgetown University, Albright reaffirmed as
long as President Saddam Hussein is in power, the Clinton
administration "will not change" policy.
</P>
<P>
"If past is prologue, under the current government, an Iraq
released from sanctions and scrutiny would pick up where it left
off half a dozen years ago," she said. "For these reasons, our
policy will not change."
</P>
<P>
Albright led the U.S. campaign against Iraq when she was the
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations from 1993 to last January.
Her speech signaled that her resolve remains unshaken now she is
the top U.S. diplomat.
</P>
<P>
"To those who ask how long our determination will last; how
long we will oppose Iraqi intransigence; how long we will insist
that the international community's standards be met, our answer is
as long as it takes," she said.
</P>
<P>
But she said the Clinton administration "looks forward" to the
day when Saddam is removed from power, a development that "could
lead to a change in U.S. policy."

CAIRO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of students of Egypt's
Alexandria University today staged a demonstration in protest
against the Israeli building of a new Jewish neighborhood in Arab
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The students, carrying banners denouncing Israeli repressive
practices in the occupied Arab lands and Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu's settlement policy, urged their government to stand up
to Israel.
</P>
<P>
It is the latest of a string of protests in Egypt against the
Jabal Abu Ghoneim or Har Homa project and Israeli attempts to
Judaize Jerusalem, which is holy to Christians, Muslims and Jews
alike.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, about 50 women from the Egyptian
trade unions and political parties today gathered outside the
headquarters of the Arab League (AL) here to protest against
Israel's settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators held banners and shouted slogans such as
"Jerusalem is Arab," demanding an emergency Arab summit to
discuss Israel's settlement policies in Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
Cairo University students held a two-day demonstration on
campus since Monday, denouncing Israel for placing obstacles in
the way to establish peace, defending the rights of the
Palestinian people and urging the AL and the United Nations
Security Council to confront obstacles placed by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, together with the Palestinian National Authority and
Saudi Arabia, has drafted a plan that calls upon Arab and Islamic
countries to immediately freeze their relations with Israel and
suspend the Middle East multilateral cooperation.

ANKARA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Turkey would give northern Cyprus
50 million U.S. dollars for its economic expansion, according to
the semi-official Anatolia news agency today.
</P>
<P>
Serdar Denktas, son of northern Cyprus leader Rauf Denktas,
made the announcement after meeting with Turkish Deputy Prime
Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller in Ankara early today.
</P>
<P>
According to Denktas, this is part of 250 million U.S. dollars
to be granted to northern Cyprus in the light of a protocol
signed between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the disputed Cyprus issue, Denktas said that
northern Cyprus is working to achieve "a realistic and
sustainable solution" to this problem, adding that the most
important matter to contribute to the solution was economic
equality between the two parties of the divided island.
</P>
<P>
He noted that if the Greek Cypriots indeed wanted a lasting
solution to the protracted conflict on the island, the Turkish
side would be ready to hold any kind of discussions with
them.
</P>
<P>
The tension between the Greeks and Turks has persisted since
1974 when the Turkish government sent troops to occupy the
northern third of the island in the weak of an abortive coup by
Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Turkey, the international supporter of
northern Cyprus, also threatened to launch a military strike
against Cyprus if it refused to stop its arms deal with
Russia for the purchase of anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's State Minister Abdullah Gul, after his talks with
Denktas, told the press that the government had ordered the
Eximbank and Ziraat Bank to start their operation in northern
Cyprus in an effort to help the northern part of the island
develop its economy.

<HEADLINE> Study: TV Ratings Attract Young Viewers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A study shows that cartoons
and other children's TV programs in the United States rarely
depict the real consequences of violence, but often glorify the
attacker, and the new TV rating system is likely to attract
youngsters to restricted programs.
</P>
<P>
"Of all genres, children's programs contain the greatest number
of these high-risk violent portrayals," researchers from four
universities concluded in a report commissioned by the National
Cable Television Association.
</P>
<P>
The age-based TV ratings system went into use January 1. But
critics said that it does not provide enough information about
shows' violent and sexual content.
</P>
<P>
More detailed information about programs' violent, sexual and
language content would be more helpful to parents, they said.
</P>
<P>
"The type of rating system now being implemented has been shown
to attract many children to restricted programs," the report said.
"This may necessitate greater supervision of your children's
viewing, or it may be the source of increased parent-children
conflict over viewing choices."
</P>
<P>
the study found that nearly all the programs that depict
violence without real consequences or punishments and other
"high-risk" portrayals are cartoons.
</P>
<P>
Researchers worry that such portrayals teach aggressive
attitudes and behavior to young children.
</P>
<P>
"Of all channel types, child-oriented basic cable (Cartoon
Network, Disney and Nickelodeon) contains the most high-risk
portrayals for young viewers," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The number of shows containing violence aired by ABC, CBS and
NBC increased 54 percent this year from 47 percent a year ago, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
But the overall level of violence on both broadcast and cable
stayed about the same. This year the survey found that 61 percent
of programs contain violence. Last year, it was 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted by researchers at the University of
California at Santa Barbara, the University of North Carolina, the
University of Texas and the University of Wisconsin conducted the
study.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Ross Has "Explicit Instructions" to Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said on
Wednesday that he has sent chief peace broker Dennis Ross to the
Middle East with "explicit instructions" on how to get the
Palestinians-Israeli peace talks back on track.
</P>
<P>
During a photo session with Bosnian President Alija
Izetbegovic, Clinton said he dis so because he was "concerned"
about the peace process, which had again been derailed because of
Israel's decision to build a Jewish neighborhood in traditionally
Arab east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Clinton declined to give any details about the "explicit
instructions", only saying: "We 're putting our heads together to
see what we can do."
</P>
<P>
It was said Ross' mission is to stop Palestinian strong
oppositions, which might evolve into violence, against obvious
violations by the Israeli government of Israeli-Palestinian
agreements.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government defying world-wide criticism of its
decision to build 6,500 Jewish homes in east Jerusalem, has vowed
to push forward with its construction plans.
</P>
<P>
The United States, placating the Palestinians with some oral
criticism of Israeli decision, has twice vetoed U.N. Security
Council's resolutions condemning Isreal's construction decision.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week Secretary of State Madeleine Albright wrote a
letter to Arafat urging him to refrain Palestinians from taking
any violent actions against Israelis, tantamount to say the
Palestinians should sit by to watch Israelis doing whatever they
like in defiance of any peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
Ross is to seek, first of all, a clear statement from Arafat to
halt attacks on Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, a suicide bomber killed three women in a Tel Aviv
cafe and injured scores of others.
</P>
<P>
Ross will first meet Arafat in Rabat, Morocco, then fly to
Israel to urge Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to ease
tensions. He will try to persuade Arafat and Netanyahu to open
negotiations over the future of the West Bank and Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Economic Optimism Level in US Middle Atlantic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The level of optimism about jobs
and business conditions in the Middle Atlantic states of New York,
New Jersey and Pennsylvania soared over the last year at a faster
pace than any other region of the United States, a research report
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted by New York-based Conference Board, a
non-profit business research group, which analyzed the region's
consumer confidence index basing on written surveys sent to 5,000
households around the country. The index is generally considered
the combined measure of residents' current economic outlook and
future expectations.
</P>
<P>
The Board said that in the first three months of this year, the
region's consumer confidence rose nearly 62 percent, compared with
the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
despite the fact the the region continues to have the bleakest
perspective of any region in the nation, many more people
apparently now believe the better times ahead, the Board noted
</P>
<P>
The region's confidence levels are by far the lowest in the
nation. In March, for example, the preliminary consumer confidence
index for the Middle Atlantic region stood at 77.2, a level that
the Conference Board said is the rock bottom threshold for any
growing economy. Anything below 70 is considered recessionary.
One year ago, the confidence index for the region stood at 51. The
confidence index for the nation as a whole stands at 118.5, up
from 98.4 one year ago.
</P>
<P>
The Board attributed the higher optimism level in the region to
brightened job prospects triggered off by increased hiring on Wall
Street and the expansion of retailing, construction and film
making.

WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States today

<HEADLINE> Signed Article On Dalai's Visit to Taiwan (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone with some historical knowledge knows that the Dalai is
not an ordinary religious personage but a political exile who has
been long engaged in separating China overseas, the article
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai, once a religious leader in Tibet, has been in exile
overseas for 38 years since he failed in an armed rebellion in
Tibet in 1959 and fled to India.
</P>
<P>
The article noted that the Dalai has been engaged in activities
to split the country under the religious cloak for many years
under the support of some western anti-China forces. On the one
hand, the Dalai begged for outside help in an attempt to
internationalize the issue of Tibet. On the other, he plotted and
instigated riots in Tibet, thus becoming a satisfying tool in the
hands of Western anti-China forces.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989. But as a
matter of fact, the article said, he does not seem to be a
"kind-hearted Buddha".
</P>
<P>
According to the "Chicago Tribune", the Central Intelligence
Agency of the United States trained many Tibetan exiles through
the 1960s and 1970s, who then sifted into Tibet and launched a
"guerrilla war" against the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
In addition, news reports had it that the Dalai Lama and Shoko
Asahara, master of Aum Shinrikyo Sect of Japan, are "intimate
friends" and the Dalai had received "donations" from Shoko
Asahara.

<HEADLINE> Signed Article On Dalai's Visit to Taiwan (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article noted that the relations between the Dalai and
Taiwan authorities have been inconsistent in the past few
years. Although late Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo had
attempted to use the Dalai against the Communist Party of China
when they were in power, they insisted that Tibet is part of
China. Therefore, it was impossible for them to sit in the same
"boat" and the Dalai failed to land on the island.
</P>
<P>
But things have changed, the article said. Those who are in
power in the Taiwan authorities are gradually collaborating with
"Taiwan Independence" forces. To split China, the two sides
decided to reinforce the collaboration.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai's visit is against the background of the increasingly
rampant splittism on the island, the article stressed, it is safe
to say that the Taiwan authorities have taken an extremely
dangerous step on the road of separating the country, and the
splittist forces on the island have already collaborated with the
"Tibet Independence" forces.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government has issued several serious warnings
about Taiwan authorities' invitation of the Dalai to visit Taiwan,
expressing the hope that Taiwan authorities would adopt prudent
and wise attitude and avoid any acts that might infringe upon the
unification and unity of the country. But the Taiwan Authorities
kept going their own way and pulling the wool over the eyes of
Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
It is the common aspiration of all the Chinese people to adhere
to the principle of "One China", fight against splittism and
safeguard national unification and unity, the article said. It is
an irreversible historical tide. Any attempt to split the country,
either "Taiwan Independence" or "Tibet Independence", will be
doomed to failure.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM: Violence Will Destroy Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy said today that violence and terror would destroy the
Middle East peace process, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Migueio Angel Moratinos, European Union
special envoy to the Middle East, Levy accused the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) of using the masses and Arab states to
isolate Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli foreign minister said the issue of Har Homa, also
known as Jabal Abu Ghoneim, a controversial area under
construction of news homes for Jews on the southeastern outskirts
of Jerusalem, was being used as an excuse.
</P>
<P>
Levy added that the problem is not just the current crisis
between Israel and the PNA, due to the Har Homa building, but
rather a threat of terror and violence.
</P>
<P>
He said that even if the crisis was resolved, Israel would
not agree to extremist activities being used as a tool by the
PNA.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos promised he would speak to Esmat Abdul Meguid,
secretary-general of the Arab League, in an attempt to moderate
Arab expressions against Israel, and to improve the atmosphere in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos, who is also Spanish ambassador to Israel, said
that he would convey the Israeli concerns to PNA President
Yasser Arafat during their scheduled meeting Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan Produces First Jeep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan marked its entry into
the car market yesterday as its first jeep rolled off the assembly
line in a joint-venture with South Korea, the Kazakhstan Pravda
agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Attending the celebration ceremony were Kazakhstan President
Nursultan Nazarbayev, Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin and San
Hong, President of KIA, South Korea's second largest automaker.
</P>
<P>
It took only half a year for the Kazakhstan factory and KIA to
produce the first batch of jeeps since the cooperation agreement
was signed late last year.
</P>
<P>
The assembly line and parts for the first batch of cars
were all imported from South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The initial investment in the project was 600,000 U.S. dollars,
but will rise to some 20 million dollars when the factory is fully
operational.
</P>
<P>
Some 400 jeeps a month currently roll off the production line
and although cars parts are currently imported from South Korea,
Kazakstan will use up to 40 to 50 percent of its own parts
starting next year.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the project in Alma-Ata, KIA also plans to build
another production line in Aktyubinsk, another major city in
Kazakhstan. Most of the cars produced there will be exported to
countries of the former Soviet Union.

CAIRO, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary General
Esmat Abdul-Meguid has expressed the league's readiness to open
an office in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo soon.
</P>
<P>
Meguid, who made the remarks during a meeting here with visiting
Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, said he will refer the
issue to the upcoming AL Council meeting on Sunday, the Egyptian
Middle East News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian side hailed the opening of an AL bureau in Sarajevo
as an important step towards promoting relations between the
central-western Balkan country and the Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia also welcomes Egypt's endeavor to exert efforts in the
near future on the international arena to guarantee the full

<HEADLINE> China to Wipe Out Drug Problem: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- China will take more effective
measures to "resolutely and completely resolve the drug problem,"
a senior official told a national anti-drug conference which ended
here today.
</P>
<P>
"The urgency and importance of this anti-drug combat must be
understood from the height of state security and national fate,"
said Ren Jianxin on behalf of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Ren is secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee and secretary of the Committee of Political Sciences and
Law of the CPC Central Committee. His speech was made yesterday
and available today.
</P>
<P>
"The drug problem is not only an issue of public security, but
also a major political issue concerning social stability, state
security, and the destiny of the nation," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"As a nation victimized by narcotics in past history, China
should never tolerate the prevalence of drugs, nor let the
humiliating history repeat itself," Ren said.
</P>
<P>
He demanded that the judicial bodies enforce the drug laws with
total compliance, and that the Party and government at all all
levels strengthen their leadership and control with the fight, and
arouse and rely on the masses of people to win the war against
drugs.
</P>
<P>
The strengthened leadership by the Party and government
organizations should be measured by how much they invest in the
anti-drug war to increase the police combat power, Ren said.
</P>
<P>
According to the anti-drug program outlined by the conference
for the next three years, China will strive to curb the increase
of new drug-using populations, block drugs outside its boundary or
at least seize them along the border areas, and to raise the
public awareness about the danger of drugs.
</P>
<P>
The conference was also told to make breakthroughs over the
next three years in the fight against narcotics-related crimes,
and with increasing efforts later, to completely root out the
drug-related crimes eventually.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Last season's runnerr-up Shanghai
Shenhua hammered Guangdong Hongyuan 4-1 in their away-match at the
Chinese Football League in Guangzhou on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The visiting squad showed all-around superiorities throughout
the game.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai opened the scorings in the 18th minute through French
player Perez on a throw-in. The Frenchmen found the net with a
shock left-foot goal after laying down on the ground.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai eleven gave the home fans another heavy blow when
striker Xie Hui headed home in the 61st minute on a corner-kick
from his teammate Shen Si, making it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
The match turned to somewhat ill-tempered in the mid of the
second half as the home team conceded two goals in a span of four
minutes, both by penalties.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong goal-keeper Ou chuliang, also the Chinese national
squad keeper, offered a penalty chance to his opponents in the
32nd minute after he brought down a forward of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Substitute Qi Hong gained the second penalty for Shanghai after
making a solo charge into the area.
</P>
<P>
Fan Zhiyi, captain of the visiting team, converted the two
penalties.
</P>
<P>
The host team finally got something consolation as Li Yuzhan
scored the only goal on a rebound of a freekick, just two minutes
before the final whistle.
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, my players had tried their best, " said Guo Yijun,
head coach of the Guangdong team, "obviously, the Shanghai team
are stronger than us. They gave us much pressure, leaving us
little chance to enter their area."
</P>
<P>
The coach said that the loose defense was another reason for
their failure. But he added that the loss would not affect their
next league tie against Yanbian Aodong.
</P>
<P>
Dalian Wanda extended their unbeaten record to 37 matches after
outplaying Tianjin Lifei 2-0 in their away-match to collect three
straight wins after three rounds this season.
</P>
<P>
Teenager Wang Peng opened the scorings in the 17th minute while
Zhang Enhua, defender of the Chinese national team, added
the second with a volley.
</P>
<P>
In the other matches of the day, Qingdao Hainiu defeated
Vanguards Huandao 2-0. Hainiu shared the second place alongside
with Shanghai Shenhua; Beijing Guo'an beat Jinan Taishan 2-1,
Sichuan Quanxing beat Yanbian Aodong 3-1 and August First drew
with Guangzhou Apollo 0-0.

SINGAPORE, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Foreign Ministry
reaffirmed today the republic's commitment towards maintaining
close bilateral relations with Malaysia, despite inaccurate media
reports that Malaysia intended to freeze bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Singapore Foreign Ministry said that as
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has said, Singapore would let
Malaysia set the pace and level of bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Singapore had noted the statement by
Malaysia's Acting Foreign Minister that the press reports on a
freeze in relations between the two countries were not quite
accurate and that no decision had been made to freeze relations
with Singapore as the Malaysian newspapers had reported.
</P>
<P>
Singapore has also noted the comments of the Malaysian Prime
Minister in Tokyo that he did not think this is a major problem
and that naturally between neighbors there will be differences off
and on, but over time this feeling can be overcome, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers reported early today that the Malaysian
cabinet decided on Wednesday to freeze indefinitely all new
bilateral ties with Singapore in the wake of recent developments
following Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew's remarks about the
Malaysian state of Johor being unsafe.
</P>
<P>
However, local television reported later that Singapore Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong said that he wanted to understand the
Malaysian reaction first before further commenting on the issue.
</P>
<P>
He said that after signing a new air services pact with his
Australian counterpart John Howard, who arrived here last night on
a three-day official visit, his first as Australian prime
minister.

<HEADLINE> UEFA Imposes Life Ban On Former Swiss Referee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- UEFA imposed a life ban Thursday
on former Swiss referee Kurt Roethlisberger for attempted bribery.
</P>
<P>
Roethlisberger admitted attempted bribery during investigations
into a European Champions' League match between Grasshopper Zurich
and Auxerre on October 30.
</P>
<P>
UEFA said Roethlisberger had contacted Grasshopper general
manager Erich Vogel and visited his office 12 days before the tie.
</P>
<P>
The former umpire hinted to the manager that he was friendly
with the match's referee Vadim Zhuk of Belarus and it would be
easy to arrange the matter. Roethlisberger's actions were
reported to UEFA by Grasshopper.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Forest Fires Spread in Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Firefighters in eastern
Mongolia are battling to bring a series of forest and grassland
fires under control, newspapers here reported today.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 200 people have been mobilized to put out the fires
which are spreading quickly through Dornod province bordering
China's Inner Mongolia. More than 100 square kilometers of forest
and grassland in the province have been affected.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 11 forest and grassland fires have occurred in
Mongolia since late February in the western province of
Ara-Khangai, Dornod and neighboring Kehentei bordering Russia, and
the central province of Tov.
</P>
<P>
So far, there have been no reports of casualities or injuries.
</P>
<P>
A total of 417 fires swept 16 of the nation's 21 provinces
early last year destroying 10.5 million hectares of forest and
pasture land, causing losses of some 2 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
To prevent future disasters, the country's Special State
Commission has taken strict preventive measures this year, such as
prohibiting people and vehicles from entering forest land,
although dry weather and high spring winds are usually blamed
for the fires.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen percent of Mongolia, the world's largest land-locked
country of about 1.6 million square kilometers, is covered with
forest and 80 percent with grassland.

<HEADLINE> Signed Article Condemns Dalai's Trip to Taiwan (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Xinhua News Agency today
published a signed article that denounced Dalai Lama's visit to
Taiwan, which started on 22 this month.
</P>
<P>
The article, written by Gang Jun and titled "A Farce of
Splitting the Country", said that the so-called "religious visit"
to Taiwan by the Dalai Lama is in fact a joint attempt to split
China by elements of "Taiwan independence" and "Tibet
independence."
</P>
<P>
"It is common public opinion that this trip of Dalai harbors
evil intentions," it noted.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the invitation for the Dalai Lama sent from
some people headed by the "Chinese Buddhist Association" in Taiwan
merely served as a cover.
</P>
<P>
"The Taiwan authorities were not only involved in this event
from the very beginning, but the actual directors behind the
scene," it said.
</P>
<P>
According to reports of some Taiwan newspapers, it said, Lee
Teng-hui has been a long-time "admirer" of the Dalai Lama, and the
two have had correspondence for a long period of time.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan officials openly admitted that Dalai's trip to the
island resulted from the "instructions of top authorities," and
demanded that "the work of publicity avoid politics and be
absolutely confined to the field of religion."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the article added, the "Chinese Buddhist Association"
inf Taiwan, which was in charge of the invitation, also made
remarks that "the work of the authorities is behind the curtain
and should not be leaked to outsiders."
</P>
<P>
"Thus it can be seen that the farce has been staged with the
meticulous planning and full support of the Taiwan authorities
headed by Lee Teng-hui," it said.
</P>
<P>
It said that although the Taiwan authorities have repeatedly
claimed that the trip of Dalai to Taiwan is purely religious and
non-governmental, it is simply not the truth.

<HEADLINE> Research Breakthrough Brings Hope to Diabetics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 27 (Xinhua) - A breakthrough in diabetes research
could mean the end of daily insulin injections for thousands of
sufferers, the science journal Nature reported today.
</P>
<P>
American scientists successfully "smuggled" drugs across
the body's powerful defense system by wrapping tiny drops of
insulin, which the body needs to control sugar levels, in spheres
of a few thousandths of a millimeter across.
</P>
<P>
These spheres of sticky polymer pass through the stomach and
stick to the walls of the small intestine, where they resist being
flushed away for several days. Eventually they penetrate the gut
wall and get into the blood. In this way, delicate substances have
been smuggled through the body's digestive juices.
</P>
<P>
Researchers, led by Professor Edith Mathiowitz of Brown
University in Rhode Island, say in Nature magazine that they were
able to alter the blood sugar levels of rats by giving them
insulin in this way.
</P>
<P>
Diabetics cannot produce insulin, which is needed to control
blood sugar levels.
</P>
<P>
To the scientists' surprise, they also managed to transfer DNA
with this method, raising the possibility of a new approach to
gene therapy.

<HEADLINE> Farmers' Income-Increase Hits the Record High Since 1990 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- In 1996 the increase of Chinese
farmers' income in real terms hit the record high since the
beginning of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
A latest survey conducted by the State Statistics Bureau shows
that the average net income of farmers in China last year was
1,926 yuan (some 240 US dollars), a rise of 22 percent or 9
percent increase in real terms than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed this to the rise of prices of agricultural
products and by-products last year, as well as the price control
efforts towards industrial consumption products.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that the household production remains the main
source of income for rural residents. The income from household
production accounted for over 70 percent of farmers' total income.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that the Chinese farmers' average
per-capita income from individual labouring, in the form of
salary, last year was 451 yuan (55 US dollars), up 23.4 percent
over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, the state policy of accelerating the
development of the central and western areas is attributable to
increases in farmers' income in those regions.

<HEADLINE> Syrian, Lebanese Presidents Meet on Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
met here today with visiting Lebanese President Elias Hrawi on the
latest development of the situation in the Middle East and
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by Syrian Vice President Abdul-Halim
Khaddam.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Lebanese talks aim to coordinate the stances of the
two countries towards the successive developments in the Middle
East, diplomatic source said.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Lebanon have reiterated that the two countries would
unite in dealing with the Israelis in the peace process. They
refuse partial and separate solutions to the issues with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been occupying the Golan Heights since the 1967
Middle East War and Syria demands its unconditional return. Israel
also established a 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone" in 1985 in
south Lebanon in a bid "to protect northern Israel from
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks on Syrian-Israeli and Lebanese-Israeli tracks
suspended early last year. Lebanon upholds an adherence to an
interlock of the two tracks and refuses to talk any peace
settlement with Israel before a tangible progress is achieved
between Syria and the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi arrived here earlier today and his visit to Syria
coincides with the start of the U.S. special envoy to the Middle
East Dennis Ross's tour of the region.
</P>
<P>
Ross seeks to bring back to track the Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks following the deterioration of the relations between the two
sides due to the decision of the Israeli government to set up the
Har Homa settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.

HANGZHOU, March 27 (Xinhua) -- East China's coastal Zhejiang
Province has begun a project to produce 380,000 tons of iodized
table salt this year.
</P>
<P>
The salt will be mainly produced in the local coastal areas in
Daishan, Ningbo, Xiangshan, and Sanmen.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to help the province put an end to a
disease which is caused by shortage of iodine by the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
In order to conduct the project, Zhejiang has received the
first phase of loans from the China State Development Bank,
totalling 5.72 million yuan, and 800,000 yuan of state funds for
development of table salt with iodine.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Taiwan authorities first
wanted to adopt a low-key profile to the Dalai's visit to Taiwan,
saying that Lee Tung Hui would not meet the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
However, with the day of the Dalai's visit approaching, the
real aspect of the thing revealed itself gradually. In fact, Lee
Tung Hui has always had his own opinion on the event, saying: "The
meeting (between me and Dalai Lama) will certainly take place,"
and the questions only lie "in which capacity, and on what
occasion."
</P>
<P>
Then the Dalai Lama expressed his wish several days ago to meet
with Lee in whatever conditions, which provides Lee with a rare
opportunity he will not miss to present a performance.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the "Legislate Yuan" has also adopted a resolution to
welcome the Dalai Lama to deliver a speech, and the Democratic
Progressive Party has spared no efforts to require cities and
counties under their leadership to hoist the "snow mountain and
lion" flag, some activists for "Taiwan independence" even openly
require the Taiwan authorities to recognize "the independence of
Tibet" through the visit of Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
Most opinions in Taiwan pointed out that "as an advocator of
Tibet independence, the Dalai Lama's visit is unable to cover its
strong political colors, even though it is defined as a visit to
spread religious doctrines."
</P>
<P>
In fact, the political implication of the Dalai Lama's visit to
Taiwan is too apparent to hide, but the Taiwan authorities
absurdly called it "a religious and nongovernmental one". Such
awkward handling obviously reveals the true untold intentions
harbored by the Taiwan authorities to invite the Dalai Lama to
Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Budapest Aims to Become Conference Capital of Eastern Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Hungary is aiming to turn
Budapest into the international conference capital of eastern
Europe to attract high-spending tourists and delegates.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian ministry of tourism said people who take part in
international meetings in Hungary spend much more than ordinary
tourists.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that international conference delegates spend
an average of 245 U.S. dollars a day, seven times more than
ordinary tourists.
</P>
<P>
They check in to five-star hotels, eat in expensive restaurants,
buy expensive gifts and ride around by taxi.
</P>
<P>
But these high-spending visitors only accounted for 0.3 percent
of foreign tourists in 1996, but brought in 169 million dollars in
foreign exchange, 8.4 percent of the country's income from tourism
last year.
</P>
<P>
Now, in a bid to attract more international conferences and
meetings, the ministry has decided to build more conference halls
and venues in Budapest over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
By 2002, Hungary aims to earn 1.5 billion dollars from hosting
international meetings, the ministry said.

</P>
<P>
In his statement on arrival, Shamshad Ahmad said, "time is
propitious for us to seize this opportunity for removing the root
causes of tension between Pakistan and India and Islamabad's
sincerity of purpose would be reciprocated by New Delhi."

core issue of Jammu and Kashmir."
</P>
<P>
There is no structured agenda for the four-day comprehensive
talks on all outstanding issues of mutual concern between the two
foreign secretaries.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of both countries have said that they would approach
the talks with an open mind.
</P>
<P>
The last round of foreign secretaries' talks between the two
countries was stalled due to sharp differences over the Kashmir
issue in January 1994. Since division in 1947, the two countries

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Sources from Ford Motors (China)
Ltd. today announced it will increase its shares in Jiangling
Motors Co., a key local light vehicle producer.
</P>
<P>
Ford will increase its equity of Jiangling from the current 20
percent to approximately 30 percent as part of Jiangling's B-share
offering.
</P>
<P>
B shares are traded by overseas investors in the Chinese
bourses.
</P>
<P>
Jiangling is to float 170 million B shares, of which Ford will
purchase about 120 million shares with a total stock value of 54.5
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The agreement still awaits formal approval by Jiangling's
Shareholders' Board and Chinese government agencies.
</P>
<P>
Ford purchased 20 percent of Jiangling's shares with 40 million
dollars in August, 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to sources, the investment is to go to the joint
development and manufacture of a new light commercial vehicle
based on Jingling's powertrain and the production technology of
Transit, a van produced by Ford in Europe. The six-seat and
12-seat models are expected to come out by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
To minimize the cost, the two sides agreed to use the existing
Jiangling and Ford facilities in China, including the five auto
parts and components joint ventures already clinched by Ford in
China.

<HEADLINE> China Advocates Eradication of Torture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- China will continue working
towards the eradication of torture, by strengthening legal
systems, strictly enforcing the law and fulfilling its obligations
under the 1984 Convention Against Torture, the advisor of the
Chinese delegation to the 53rd session of the United Nations
Commission on Human Rights said today.
</P>
<P>
"It has been the consistent position of the Chinese government
to prohibit torture, or any other cruel, inhuman or degrading
treatment or punishment," said Dai Yuzhong, the advisor.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, China has made unremitting efforts. As one of
the first signatories to the Convention against Torture, China has
strictly fulfilled her obligations under the convention and made
gradual progress over the past decade," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last May, the Committee against Torture considered China's
second report on implementing the convention. In that report, Dai
said, China gave a comprehensive account of its progress in
legislation, the judiciary and administration.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China's legislative body made major amendments to
the Criminal Procedural Law. On March 14 this year, the Fifth
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress adopted a
comprehensive revision of the Criminal Law.
</P>
<P>
"All these go along with the general direction of modern
criminal legislation. They stress the lawful punishment and
prevention of crime as well as the protection of the legitimate
rights of citizens," said Dai. "These constitute a major step
forward in the construction of China's legal system and are of
great significance in the prohibition of torture."
</P>
<P>
Talking about the work of the Commission on Human Rights, Dai
said, "The Commission on Human Rights has appointed rapporteurs
and established working groups, most of which can, within their
respective mandates, conduct research on relevant issues, exchange
their views and information and put forward useful suggestions.
</P>
<P>
"But we should not overlook the problems that still exist: A
few working groups and rapporteurs have deviated from their
mandates entrusted by the Commission, making slanderous
accusations against developing countries and believing very biased
arguments," he said.
</P>
<P>
"They have launched willful attacks on developing countries with
disregard for the judicial sovereignty of signatory states and
confusing the demarcation between torture and the legal punishment
of criminals. A stop must be put to such a practice," he said.
</P>
<P>
As for the draft optional protocol to the Convention against
Torture currently being considered by a working group of the
commission, Dai put forward two proposals:
</P>
<P>
1. The Optional Protocol should clearly manifest the aims
and principles enshrined in the UN Charter, especially the
principle of respect for sovereignty and non-interference in the
internal affairs of other states.
</P>
<P>
These principles are the basic norms of international relations
and therefore should be followed in the field of human
rights. Only when those basic principles and norms are complied
with can activities in the field of human rights play a
positive role.
</P>
<P>
As the optional protocol will establish an entirely new
mechanism, which will be carried out on the territories of
signatory states, these principles should be particularly stressed.

2. Prior consent from states concerned must be obtained before
any visit is carried out. Such a visit must be based on respect
for the laws of the states concerned.
</P>
<P>
The states concerned should be allowed to express their
views. This is because the prohibition and prevention of torture
is essentially the responsibility of states and realized through
the measures adopted by them.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of a visit is to ensure better cooperation, rather
than creating confrontation let alone putting a state on trial.
The success of the visit relies on the cooperation of the
signatory states. Without such cooperation, it is difficult to
imagine that any visit can be carried out smoothly.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Clarifies Its Stand on Ties with Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I have to make it clear that what was highlighted in most of
the local newspapers today is not very accurate," Abang Abu Bakar,
who is Minister in the Prime Minister's Department, said in a
statement issued by his office here.
</P>
<P>
But he confirmed that the Malaysian cabinet did discuss the
recent developments related to Malaysia-Singapore ties at its
weekly meeting chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
"What was meant is that the government is studying the
implications of the episode on bilateral ties with Singapore
following the statement by Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew
on Johor," he said.
</P>
<P>
Today's newspaper reports and the Malaysian national news
agency Bernama yesterday quoted several ministers as saying that
the Cabinet yesterday decided to freeze fresh bilateral dealings
with Singapore in the wake of recent developments following Lee's
controversial statements about Johor.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is away from the
country paying a four-day official visit to Japan and Foreign
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi is also in Japan as a member of
Mahathir's official entourage.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's relations with Singapore will be back to normal as
soon as Malaysians got over their feeling of hurt and bitterness
caused by an uncalled for remark against their country, Mahathir
said in Tokyo today while commenting on yesterday's reported
Cabinet decision to cool off ties and put off fresh dealings with
the island republic, reports from Tokyo said.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, meanwhile, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said that
he wanted to understand Malaysia's reaction first before he could
further comment on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Denies Involvement in Zaire Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOME, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Burundi military strongman Pierre
Buyoya denied here today the Zairean government's
charge that his country is involved in the conflict in eastern
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
He said at a news conference that Burundi has nothing to do
with both the warring sides of Zaire, adding that he even does
not know rebel leader Laurent Kabila himself.
</P>
<P>
But he added that he is pleased to see that the two sides are
willing to negotiate to resolve their problems.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean government has accused Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi of
sending troops to fight along with the rebels in eastern
Zaire. The three countries all deny the charge.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the rebel delegation attending the
extraordinary summit of the Organisation of African Unity being
held here clarified that the Zaire crisis is not a problem
between countries, but a problem within Zaire. The rebel
delegates told reporters that nobody will break the territorial
integrity of Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya is now in the capital of Togo for the summit aimed to
find a negotiated settlement to the Zaire crisis.
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit will close later today.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Ready to Send Security Force to Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 27 (Xinhua)--Sweden is ready to send a
security force to Albania on missions to protect trucks and other
vehicles delivering emergency aid to the country which has been
swept up in a wave of unrest and violence since January.
</P>
<P>
Swedish Prime Minister Goeran Persson announced the proposal
after meeting his Italian counterpart, Romano Prodi in Rome,
according to the press here today.
</P>
<P>
The announcement marks a change in the line taken by Sweden
since Tuesday, when Swedish Foreign Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen
said that she was sceptical of proposals to send Swedish police
officers to Albania where armed rebels have taken control of
several southern towns in protest against President Sali Berisha.
</P>
<P>
Explaining this change in policy, Persson said pressure was
increasing on Sweden and other countries to prevent Albania's
total collapse, he said.
</P>
<P>
A Swedish decision to send in a police unit would be
conditional upon a request for such assistance by the United
Nations, the European Union or the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
The European Union relief mission arrived in Albania on
Wednesday to discuss how to help end the unrest in the
country. Six EU states have also sent a team of military experts
to prepare for a possible multinational security force to protect
humanitarian workers and planned aid shipments.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Meets Portuguese Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Chen Ziying, deputy director of
the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office under the State Council,
met here today with Portuguese Defense Minister Antonio Vitorino.
</P>
<P>
Extending welcome to the minister, Chen said the Chinese
government has attached great importance to Sino-Portugese
friendly relations and that he believes the minister's visit would
further promote the growth of bilateral friendly and cooperative
ties.
</P>
<P>
China and Portugal have maintained a sound cooperation since
the signing of the Joint Declaration on the Macao issue 10 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Through the work of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group in
the past years, both sides has made progress on settling some
issues in Macao's transitional period, he added.
</P>
<P>
As the return of Macao in 1999 is approaching, there is still
much work left for the two sides, he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
He said leaders of China and Portugal all advocated to settle
issues with a far-sighted attitude, and that this is helpful to
maintain Macao's stable transition, smooth transfer of power, as
well as to its long-term prosperity and stability, and in the
basic interests of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
With the guarantee of Deng Xiaoping's great concept of "one
country, two systems" as well as the friendly cooperation between
China and Portugal, any problem can be resolved, as long as the
two sides continue to have consultations on the basis of the Joint
Declaration, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Vitorino expressed his agreement to Chen's view, and said that
the Portuguese government is very clear about the Chinese
government's confidence in Macao's future development, and they
are also confident with it.

WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

<P>
The New York Times:

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official on Macao Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Chen Ziying, deputy director of
the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council,
voiced the hope here today that China and Portugal will increase
cooperation to settle the Macao question.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, he said April 13 this year is the
10th anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Portuguese Joint
Declaration, which has settled the historic Macao question, and
set an example in dealing with some international disputes.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Declaration has been well implemented in the past 10
years, and both sides have made achievements in the negotiations
on the Macao issue through the Joint Liaison Group, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is two years and nine months before Macao will return to its
motherland, Chen said, adding that the Joint Liaison Group should
accelerate its work to settle issues, especially the localization
of the civil servants and law, as well as the official language
status of Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Chen went on to say that the Chinese side has always kept to
the Joint Declaration, hoping that the two sides will increase
friendly negotiations and cooperation in handling the Macao
question.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the issue of nationality, Chen said the Chinese
government has always held a consistent and definite stance on
this issue.
</P>
<P>
As there are Chinese residents and non-Chinese residents,
especially the Portuguese descendants, in Macao society, the
Chinese side advocates that the non-Chinese will freely choose
their nationality, either being Chinese or Portuguese, instead of
requiring them to be Chinese, he explained.
</P>
<P>
How to conduct this work will be subjected to discussion by the
Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group, Chen added.

<HEADLINE> Israel, EU to Sign Procurement Deals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will
sign two key procurement agreements with Israel within the next
few weeks in order to reduce the trade gap, according to European
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
EU Counselor in Tel Aviv Michael Ryan was quoted by today's
Jerusalem Post as saying that the public procurement and
telecommunications agreements would help reduce Israel's trade
deficit with Europe, which stands at 6.7 billion U.S. dollars in
1996, 72 percent of Israel's overall deficit.
</P>
<P>
Israel will be the only world signatory of such a
telecommunications agreement with Europe and the sole nation in
the Mediterranean to sign a procurement deal with the EU, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The agreements will give strength to the EU-Israeli trade
over and above the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) of
the World Trade Organization, allowing Israeli access to
Europe's annual procurement market of 600 to 800 billion
dollars and a 25 billion dollar telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
According to the main procurement agreement, Israel will be
able to compete for national and local government and public
enterprise agency tenders. In return, rules regarding offset
provisions, local content and threshold limits governing Israeli
state tenders under the GPA will be relaxed for EU suppliers.
</P>
<P>
There has been increasing concern in Israel's Finance
Ministry about local bidders' alleged ongoing failure to win
government tenders offered by EU countries. Israeli industrialists
maintain that there exists a proliferation of non-tariff
barriers which obstruct Israel's exports to Europe.
</P>
<P>
In a recent meeting, Israeli Finance Minister Dan Meridor
admitted that he and his staff had to make a greater
effort to explain the opportunities available in Europe to
domestic industrialists. The belief in Europe is that the EU
is the most liberal market in the world, given the
individual interests of each member state.
</P>
<P>
The Britain-based Economist Advisory Group Ltd. was currently
compiling a report for Israeli Finance Ministry examining how
Israel's full exporting potential to the EU could best be
realized, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Congratulates Completion of PLA Military Facilities in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Ambassador Zhao Jihua, Chinese
senior representative on the Joint Liaison Group (JLG),
congratulated today the smooth and punctual completion of four
military reprovisioning projects to be used by the People's
Liberation Army's (PLA) garrison in Hong Kong after July 1.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at a completion ceremony held by the Hong Kong
Architectural Services Department for the four facilities -- the
Military Storage Facilities at Shek Kong Camp, the Joint Movement
Unit at Chek Lap Kok Airport, the Military Hospital at Gun Club
Hill Barracks and the Naval Base on Stonecutters Island.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador pointed out that the pragmatic and actively
cooperative approach adopted by technical experts from the Chinese
 and British sides has ensured a smooth completion of the
facilities, which cost a total of some 4 billion HK dollars (513
million US dollars) and took more than two years after the JLG
reached agreement on the use of military sites on June 30, 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side is satisfied with the qualities of the four
projects, which meet the functional and technological requirements
 it set out, he continued.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the Architectural Services Department, the Civil
Engineering Department, the Electrical and Mechanical Services
Department and the three contractors involved for the great
efforts they have made toward the completion of the projects.
</P>
<P>
Following the completion of the principal parts, there is still
 a lot of work ahead, such as afforestation, testing of equipment,
 he continued, voicing the hope that cooperation will be continued
 in the next few months so that the projects will be handed over
to the PLA garrison to the satisfaction of all the sides.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from China's Defense Ministry and Foreign
Ministry, the Hong Kong government and the contractors attended
the ceremony.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Southwest China's Province Trains Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- More than half of the farmers in
southwest China's Guizhou Province are now able to apply two or
three agricultural practical techniques to their work, as a result
of training programs offered by the local government.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 40 million farmers have attended training
courses on practical techniques; of this group, some 13 million
took more than two courses.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou, an undeveloped province in the country, is known for
its hostile farming production conditions and unskilled
farmers. In some remote mountain areas, the old-fashioned
low-yielding farming method of slash-and-burn cultivation is still
in use.
</P>
<P>
To change this, the province has listed the training of farmers
as a high priority in its agricultural scheme in the next several
years.
</P>
<P>
The efforts have paid off: Guizhou now has more than 50,000
agricultural technicians of various levels. And more than 40,000
farmers have passed the exams for the "Green Certificate," given
to farmers who have learned certain farming techniques.

<HEADLINE> Macao Basic Law Guarantees Smooth Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A smooth handover of power in Macao
will be achieved as the Basic Law of Macao, which legalizes the
policy of "one country, two systems," is becoming known to more
and more people in the territory, a senior Chinese official based
here said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch,
said at a gathering Wednesday night to mark the 4th anniversary of
promulgation of on the Basic Law that the law has boosted Macao
residents' confidence in their future.
</P>
<P>
"The policy of 'one country, two systems' in the realization of
a peaceful reunification of the motherland is a great creation of
Deng Xiaoping," he said. "And the Basic Law has put that policy in
the form of law so that it can be implemented."
</P>
<P>
Promulgated on March 31, 1993, the Basic Law stipulates that
the capitalist system and the basic style of life in Macao will
remain unchanged for 50 years after the handover. Macao will also
enjoy a high degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the law has set the orientation for major
transitional affairs, and is the source of confidence for all
Macao residents.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said that Hong Kong's return to China and the
convening of the 15th national congress of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) later this year will both have a positive effect on a
smooth handover and a stable transition.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's return to the motherland will offer valuable
experience and encourage Macao residents to take an active part in
handling the transitional affairs," Wang said. "The 15th Party
congress will push forward China's reform and opening to the
outside world, and a stronger motherland is the best guarantee for
Macao's stability and development."
</P>
<P>
The director praised the Macao Basic Law Promotion Association
for its achievements in promoting the law, and pledged further
support for the association.
</P>
<P>
The association has launched a promotion campaign among local
residents. A special TV program it co-produced with China Central
Television Station (CCTV) on Macao and the basic law will be
broadcast as of March 30 on several channels of CCTV.

<HEADLINE> Target Set for Chinese Translation of HK's Legal Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The mammoth task of translating
Hong Kong's court documents into Chinese should be completed by
the handover, Hong Kong's attorney-general said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But Jeremy Mathews admitted that a glossary of English-Chinese
legal terms, which is needed as a reference guide in the future,
would probably not be finished by the time.
</P>
<P>
A bilingual Court Documents Unit was set up in April 1995 in
the Judiciary's Prosecutions Division of Hong Kong's Legislature.
By November the same year, all defendants in Magistrate, District
and High Courts were served charge sheets and indictments in both
languages, Mathews said.
</P>
<P>
More trials will be conducted in the Chinese language in all
levels to the courts, He predicted.
</P>
<P>
He had planned to add 11 additional posts within the Bilingual
Court Documents Unit to meet the demand to provide not only
bilingual charge sheets, but also summaries of facts, agreed
evidence and immunity documents for witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Since the enactment of the first bilingual ordinance in 1989,
261 bilingual ordinances and 1,031 pieces of bilingual subsidiary
legislation have been enacted, Mathews added.

LOME, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Zairean rebels' team attending
the special summit of the Organization African Union (OAU) on the
Zaire conflict said here today that they are ready to negotiate
but will never share power with President Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>

days to come."
</P>
<P>
Kahaha noted that they have been asking for negotiations for
more than five months without receiving any answer from the
government, adding that only a few days ago did they learn the
government is "going to be serious".
</P>
<P>
The rebel delegates said that they do not "trust them too
much".
</P>

Asked if they are going to share power with President Mobutu
as indicated by his ruling Movement of Popular Revolution on
Tuesday, Kahaha said: "Never."
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Thai tourism business is
expected to shift its focus to local tourists as the Tourism
Authority of Thailand (TAT) is seeking new strategies to develop
the country's tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
The change is urged in a tourism development master plan
prepared by the Thailand development research institute for the
TAT.
</P>
<P>
The focus of attention should be given to local tourists
instead of foreign tourists, according to the plan revealed by the
TAT today.
</P>
<P>
The initiative is intended to encourage local officials to take
serious actions to improve the infrastructure and service
facilities to cater to tourism, while helping upgrade the
standards of living of Thais.
</P>
<P>
Once improvements are made, they will be equally applicable to
foreign tourists, the plan said.
</P>
<P>
The plan also proposed short-term and long-term goals for Thai
tourism development.
</P>
<P>
The immediate aim between 1998-2003 is to focus on development
which will preserve the country's culture and environment with the
ultimate goal of turning Thailand into a world class tourism
destination, according to the plan.

the time being. Both airlines will be able to plan expansion of
services which will bring tourism and trade benefits to both
countries, it said.
</P>
<P>
Qantas currently operates a total of 54 services per week to
Singapore from Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane,
Cairns and Darwin. Many of these services go on to Bangkok, Hong
Kong, Bombay, Frankfurt and London.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Airlines, on the other hand, operates 46
passenger services per week from Singapore to Darwin, Cairns,
Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. It also operates
four B747 freighter services per week to Sydney and Melbourne, one
of which also carries exports from Perth, the CAAS said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, passenger traffic between Australia and Singapore hit
a record of 1.9 million movements. There was also an increase in
freight traffic of 4.7 percent to reach nearly 100,000 tons, it
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Asian Football Confederation
(AFC) confirmed for the first time Thursday that four players
failed tests at Asian Cup last December.
</P>
<P>
The players have not been identified, but the failures were
after the semi-finals and the final of Asia's top soccer event.
</P>
<P>
AFC general secretary Peter Velappan ended months of
speculation since the tournament by saying the failures were
"deeply disappointing".
</P>
<P>
AFC sources said the cases had now been referred to the
International Football Federation (FIFA) to decide what action to
take.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Iran reached the
semi-finals. Saudi Arabia beat UAE in the final.
</P>
<P>
The only previous drug failure at an Asian tournament was
Thailand's Srisak Kidalee at the 1994 Asian Games in Hiroshima,
Japan. He was banned for a year and the Football Association of
Thailand was fined 3,000 U.S. dollars.

<P>
LAGOS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Financial Minister
Abthony Ani has disclosed the government's plan for accelerated
social and economic development by the year 2000 in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
In his lecture called "Nigeria in the Third Millennium --the
Road to Social and Economic Development" at a forum organized by
the Nigerian Society of International Law on Monday, Ani unfolded
the government's seven-point program which includes:
</P>
<P>
-- The development of the steel sector;
</P>
<P>
-- Improvement of energy supply;
</P>
<P>
-- Increased funding of scientific and technological
activities;
</P>
<P>
-- The empowerment of rural population through the Family
Economic Advancement Program;
</P>
<P>
-- Attainment of an independent judiciary;
</P>
<P>
-- Improvement of educational and health care systems;
</P>
<P>
-- The expansion of port facilities.
</P>
<P>
Ani assured that the Ajaokuta Steel Plant which has cost the
country several billion U.S. Dollars and been under construction
since 1980s will be completed by 1999, adding that the government
has earmarked 600 million Dollars for the project.
</P>
<P>
"It is envisaged that before the third millennium bursts upon
us, the Naira (Nigeria's currency) will attain its true
potentials as a convertible currency of the ECOWAS (Economic
Community of West African States) region," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is only logical, given the natural advantage of Nigeria as
the economic locomotive of the region," he added.

</P>
<P>
FREETOWN, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone has not asked
Nigeria to extradict Sierra Leone's deposed rebel leader Foday
Sankoh#,Attorney General Solomon Berewa Rsaid said in an
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"The Sierra Leone government has not considered the
extradiction option as yet," Berewa said.
</P>
<P>
He declined to say whether such request will be made in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Despite recent calls from legal institutions in the country
for Sankoh's trial on war crimes, "we are not doing anything
about Sankoh now," a spokesman for law officers said.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh was arrested at Lagos airport about two weeks ago
after a quantity of arms and ammunition were found on him. Now he
is still being questioned by Nigerian security officials.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh was deposed from the leadership by senior members of
the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) organization who accused him
of "intransigence toward the peace agreement" signed in Abidjan
last November.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace accord, Sankoh should be benefited from an
amnesty for crimes he had committed before November 30 but not
afterwards.

COLOMBO, March 27 (Xinhua) -- An islandwide search to flush out
 all the unlicensed firearms resumed today, according to a police
officer here.
</P>
<P>
The Deputy inspector General of Police M. Nizam today said that
</P>
<P>
according to police estimate, there are at least 1,500 of these
weapons to be collected.
</P>
<P>
The search for these firearms began a few days ago, but it had
to be suspended temporarily on account of last week's local
government elections.
</P>
<P>
Nizam said that a number of special police teams are deployed
islandwide and each of them is headed by a gazetted officer. A
total of 125 men are deployed.
</P>
<P>
The police teams will be send to various parts of the country,
especially to those areas where the firearms are suspected to be
hidden, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that instructions have been given to all the police
teams to arrest all those who possess unlicensed weapons.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, some 1,600 of these weapons have been surrendered.
</P>
<P>
The unauthorized firearms are those issued to politicians for
their protection by the former United National Party regime during
 the southern youth uprising, and not returned after the uprising
was suppressed in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Spokesman: Arafat Ready to Meet Netanyahu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat is prepared to meet with Israeli
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu to salvage peace, Arafat's
spokesman Marwan Kanafani said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Arafat does not oppose holding direct talks with Netanyahu if
they aim at salvaging the Mideast peace process and searching for
reasons behind the current crisis between the two sides," he told the
Egyptian MENA news agency today.
</P>
<P>
Kanafani, who accompanied Arafat during his one-hour stopover
early this morning at the Cairo International Airport, said a date
for this projected meeting has not been set yet.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli negotiations have stuck after Netanyahu
went ahead with the Jewish housing project, and a Palestinian
carried out a suicide bomb attack in a Tel Aviv cafe, leaving
three killed.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said Wednesday that he was prepared to meet Netanyahu so
long as the purpose of their meeting was to discuss peace and not
a public stunt.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's communications chief David Bar-Illan has said
Netanyahu would accept a summit with Arafat so long as the issue
of security topped the agenda. But Palestinians object to any
preconditions and say the two sides must talk about other issues
besides security.
</P>
<P>
On future vision of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations,
Kanafani said that implementation of the final status of the
Palestinian-Israeli accord hinges on finalizing the transitional
phase.
</P>
<P>
"However, the Israeli policy in this respect gives no hope in
reaching the final phase," he added, referring to Netanyahu's
proposal to wrap up the final talks within six months and bypass
the obligations under the interim accords.
</P>
<P>
The transitional phase issues such as airport, harbor,
redeployment of Israeli forces and the refugees remain unsolved,
he said. "This makes negotiations with the Israeli side useless,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians and Israelis have missed the March 17 deadline for
final talks, which will settle the sensitive issues such as
Jerusalem and Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
Refuting accusations that the PNA incites clashes in the
occupied lands, Kanafani blamed the situation on the Israeli
government.
</P>
<P>
"We fight extremism and terrorism and if there is extremism in
the Palestinian streets it is also found inside the Israeli
government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat had cut short his southern Asia tour and headed for a
Jerusalem Committee meeting of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference in Rabat, Morocco, to meet with U.S. Mideast peace
envoy Dennis Ross, who has embarked on a trip to the Mideast to
try to get Israeli-Palestinian talks back on track.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official is expected to fly to Israel later to see
Netanyahu Thursday or Friday in a bid to arrange a direct
Palestinian-Israeli meeting at the top level.

<HEADLINE> China Ready to Properly Solve Problems Between China and Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- China values its good-neighborly
friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation with Vietnam, and
is ready to hold friendly consultations with it to properly solve
problems existing between China and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai made the
statement at a regular news conference here today.
</P>
<P>
In response to Vietnam's recent representations to the Chinese
side on sea explorations by a Chinese drilling ship in the north
of the South China Sea, Cui said that China holds the rights over
the continental shelf and exclusive economic zones according to
the international laws, including the United Nations Convention on
the Law of the Sea.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, he said, it is beyond reproach that this ship has
made normal explorations in the continental shelf and exclusive
economic zones claimed by China.
</P>
<P>
He said China has always held that problems and disputes
existing among countries should be solved through peaceful
negotiations, noting that China cherishes its friendship and
cooperative relations with Vietnam, and is ready to hold friendly
consultations with Vietnam, in order to properly solve certain
problems remaining between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Media Express Pessimism on US Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Syrian official daily Teshrin
expressed pessimism about the results of U.S. efforts as long as
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu procrastinates full
withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories.
</P>
<P>
In its commentary today on the occasion of the start of the
new mission to the region by U.S. special envoy to the Middle
East Dennis Ross, the paper said that the revival of the peace
process necessitates that the United States stress the importance
of implementing all previous accords and the land-for-peace
principle.
</P>
<P>
However, Ross is not going to stress such a thing, the paper
said, adding that Ross's efforts aim only to cool down the tense
situation and "urge the Palestinians to accept Netanyahu's
conditions in return for nothing from Washington or Tel Aviv."
</P>
<P>
Ross left the United States for Rabat, Morocco, where he is
expected to meet Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat this morning
before flying to Israel to see Netanyahu later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Ross's tour of the region follows the deterioration of the
Palestinian-Israeli relations and the suspension of the peace
talks due to the Israeli government decision to build the
Har Homa settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. efforts will be of no avail as long as Netanyahu
procrastinates the land-for-peace principle, according to the
paper.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local daily Al-Thawrah today accused Washington
of protecting the Israeli aggressive government.
</P>
<P>
"The veto is still brandished at any one who dares to oppose
Netanyahu's anti-peace settlement policy," it said, adding
that "the U.S. is still talking from time to time about peace."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Uganda Couples Threats with Promises to Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- President Yoweri Museveni has
offered an olive branch to the rebel Lord's Resistance Army (LRA)
by suggesting its leader Joseph Kony and his top aides to choose
a country to stay and wait for an amnesty.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a governmental officer said that the Ugandan
President had formed a new strategy and set up more task forces
within the Ugandan army to quell rebels still fighting,
especially in the north and west.
</P>
<P>
It was the first olive branch held out by the government after
Uganda's three main rebel groups -- the Christian fundamentalists
LRA, the West Nile Bank Front (WNBF) headed by a former minister
of dictator Idi Amin and the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) --
had suffered heavy military losses recently.
</P>
<P>
Museveni launched the suppression drive in mid-February and
went to the north to command the fighting himself.
</P>
<P>
The message was revealed by Martin Aliker, the State Minister
for Foreign Affairs, at a meeting with northern traditional
leaders of Acholi tribe on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Aliker, who was given an order by Museveni to contact with the
LRA rebels, warned in the north on Tuesday that the Ugandan army
would not spare Kony if he continues to fight the Ugandan
government.
</P>
<P>
Aliker disclosed that he has also been in contact with Otti
Lagony, a famous LRA field commander, through an emissary.
</P>
<P>
The LRA, which once had 13 detachments with more than 2,000
soldiers, has only three detachments comprising some 200 men each
in southern Sudan after losing battles recently, earlier reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the past three weeks, the WNBF which was once
active in the north-west, lost its bases in southern Sudan and
western Zaire due to offensives mounted by those countries'
rebels.
</P>
<P>
As many as 800 WNBF rebels were reportedly killed in an ambush
in southern Sudan on March 12 and most of WNBF leaders were
either killed or captured.
</P>
<P>
Juma Oris, the WNBF key leader, was said to have been wounded
and gone underground.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported Wednesday that at least 119 WNBF remnant
fighters fleeing to Zaire were handed over by Zairean rebels to
the Ugandan authorities.
</P>
<P>
Around the same time, Sudanese rebels captured secret files on
the collaborators cooperating with WNBF and handed them over the
Ugandan security authorities.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of WNBF rebels have been sued by the Ugandan
authorities.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Lt. Colonel Geofrey Muhesi, the 307
Brigade Commander in western Kasese district, said the Ugandan
army there is ready to talk to the ADF remnants currently hiding
in the Rwenzori mountains.
</P>
<P>
However, Muhesi said this is just a field command's initiative
and would not be contradictory to the govertnment's line of not
talking to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
"In this strategy we will be identifying individuals and talk
to them. We are not talking to ADF... Now we only want to help
them out of the bush and show them how to get food without the
risk of being shot at," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The ADF now has no structural command and those boys up there
(in the mountains) are only playing a bloody game of survival by
raiding villages for food," he added.
</P>
<P>
ADF had some 1,000 militiamen in November when it entered
western Uganda from its bases in Zaire to try to establish bases
in Rwenzori mountains.
</P>
<P>
Later, the ADF main forces were reportedly eliminated by the
Ugandan army in the west and its remnants were dividing into
small groups. Its bases in eastern Zaire were also destroyed by
Zairean rebels.
</P>
<P>
Now some ADF remaining groups have allegedly penetrated into
southwestern Uganda and harass local people, reports reaching
here said.
</P>
<P>
The three rebel groups have their objective of toppling the
Museveni regime, but now, people do not know whether they will
accept the government gesture of peace or not after suffering
defeats in the battlefields.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan's Population Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan's population has
dropped by 280,000 to 16.39 million by January 1, 1997, compared
to the same period of last year, the latest official statistics
said.
</P>
<P>
Kazakh experts attributed the decline to increasing emigration,
which began after the collapse of the former Soviet Union in
1991. This reversed the trend of population growth in Kazakhstan
which lasted from 1960 to 1991.
</P>
<P>
Experts also blamed the growing number of aging population
for the falling demographic trends in Kazakhstan. In 1990, the
population above 60 accounted for 10 percent of the total, but the
figure has jumped to 12 percent at present and will rise to an
estimated 17 percent by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
They predicted that Kazakhstan's population, which will begin
to pick up from 2000, will hit 16.75 million by 2005 and 17.18
million by 2010, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan now has an urban population of 9.11 million, plus
7.28 million in the rural areas.

<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature plans to
send inspectors to six provinces and municipalities to check on
how well the Hygienic Food Law is being carried out.
</P>
<P>
The inspection, to start later this month and continue through
May, will cover provinces or municipalities of Zhejiang, Jiangsu,
Beijing, Tianjin, Hubei and Hunan.
</P>
<P>
Other provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities under
the direct leadership of the central government were asked to
conduct self-examinations and to submit their self-assessment
reports to the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The law-enforcement inspection tours are aimed at promoting the
correct and comprehensive implementation of the law and ensuring
the people have safe, hygienic food with enough nutrition.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the inspection will be placed on food for infants,
children and health foods.
</P>
<P>
In addition to overseeing the general conditions of the law
enforcement, the lawmakers will devote much of their time
reviewing the hygienic conditions of food manufacturers, dealers,
and the supervisional mechanism over food hygiene.
</P>
<P>
The top legislature promulgated a trial law on hygienic food in
1982, and enacted a formal one in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Henan to Strengthen Protection of Farmland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan Province,
a major grain producer in the country, plans to strengthen its
efforts to protect arable land.
</P>
<P>
The per capita share of cultivated land among farmers in the
province is only 0.07 ha, lower than the country's average.
</P>
<P>
The province has said it will increase grain output by five
billion kilograms by the year 2000, but the ever-decreasing
acreage of arable land due to the increasing population made the
plan difficult to implement.
</P>
<P>
The province has worked out a series of regulations and rules
to protect farmland. So far, the safeguarded area stands at some
seven million ha.
</P>
<P>
To further tighten its management on tillable land, Henan plans
to set up a foundation for farmland protection. Meanwhile, a
compensation system will be adopted to ensure that the acreage of
farmland in protection zones does not decrease further.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the province will reclaim wasteland and
recultivate idle land to make up for the possible reduction in
acreage. In the past two years, the province has reclaimed 24,000
ha of such land.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Start Export to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian companies will start
exporting detergents worth 26 million U.S. dollars early next
month to Iraq in line with the U.N.-Iraq oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's news agency Petra reported today that Ghasan Azar,
chairman of the Modern Chemicals Company (MCC), said that his firm
will start dispatching 4,000 tonnes of soaps to Iraq early next
month.
</P>
<P>
The first shipment will leave Jordan in the first week of
April, he said. The remaining shipments will reach Baghdad over
the coming four months.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we receive the U.N. message of credit, expected in
a few days, we will start exporting our products to Iraq," Azar said.
</P>
<P>
The message is a guarantee from the U.N. to the companies that
the goods will be paid by the U.N., not by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
MCC is one of the 10 Jordanian companies which received
U.N. permission to export soaps and detergents to Iraq. The
approved orders, from nearly 50 sent by Jordan to the Sanctions
Committee of the United Nations, are worth 26 million dollars. The
rest, still unapproved, are worth around 95 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The items include detergents, cooking oil and salt.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food agreement reached last December, permits Iraq
to export two billion dollars worth of oil to purchase food,
medicine and other humanitarian aid over an initial six-month
period for its 20 million citizens suffering from U.N.-sanctions
imposed in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an Iraqi industrial team arrived in Jordan early
this week to discuss with Jordanian industrialists on
strengthening trade ties between the two countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Chairman of China's Central
Military Commission (CMC) Chi Haotian met here this afternoon with
a military delegation from Bahrain headed by Rashid Al-Khalifa,
assistant chief of Staff of Bahrain's Defense Force.
</P>
<P>
This is the first military delegation of Bahrain ever to visit
China since the two countries established diplomatic relations in
1989.
</P>
<P>
Extending a warm welcome, Chi, who is also State Councillor and
Defense Minister, said that although China and Bahrain only enjoy
a few years of diplomatic links, bilateral relations have
developed rapidly, and there is a good cooperative basis for the
two governments, the two peoples and the two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
He noted that both China and Bahrain pursue an independent
foreign policy of peace, and they are facing the same question of
peace and development.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also share many common points in
international affairs, and they both oppose hegemonism and power
politics, added Chi.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China always holds that all countries,
big or small, rich or poor, strong or weak, are equal members of
the international community.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government attaches importance to Rashid's current
visit to China, believing that this visit will further push
forward the development of friendship and cooperation between the
two countries and the two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Chi briefed the visitors on China's
domestic situation and its defensive national defense policy, and
he also criticized the concept of so-called "China threat".
</P>
<P>
Rashid said that China is an important force for safeguarding
world peace and stability, and his visit here is aimed at
furthering the friendship and cooperation between Bahrain and
China, as well as between their two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Rashid also expressed his thanks for China's just stance on
supporting the third world countries and people at the UN General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's
Liberation Army Wu Quanxu and Bahraini Ambassador to China Hussein
Rashid Al-Sabbagh were present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Bahraini delegation is here as guest of China's National

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Upholds Consistent Land Policy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- It's mid-March in northeastern
China, the time for spring planting. Shi Yongjin, a 48-year-old
farmer, is plowing in the field as he calculates this year's
harvest.
</P>
<P>
"I earned 2,500 yuan (301.2 US dollars) last year
growing wheat and corn, I figure this year it won't be too far
from that, and will be enough to meet the daily needs of my
family," said Shi.
</P>
<P>
When the leasing agreement he signed 15 years ago came to an
end just before Spring Festival season in early February, Shi
re-contracted the 0.4-hectare-farmland from his village.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 of Shi's fellow villagers have signed such
agreements with the Xiadahe village commission in Liaoyang county,
for another 30 years.
</P>
<P>
In the bigger picture, farmers in one third of the villages in
northeastern Liaoning Province have renewed their land-leasing
contracts so far, with the rest to do so by the year-end or early
next year.
</P>
<P>
Since the nation launched its industrialization drive only a
few dozen years ago, the basic livelihood of rural Chinese still
depends on the farmland.
</P>
<P>
To raise its land-use efficiency, China began abolishing
farming communes and moved to the household contract
responsibility system in the late 1970s, offering the state-owned
farmland for lease to the peasants, mostly for 15-year periods.
Fengyang County of eastern Anhui Province was the pioneer, and
by 1984, the practice has spread across rural China.
</P>
<P>
Agro-scientist Wu Bin said the new system prompted Chinese
farmers to work harder to make full use of the arable land, since
"the more high-yielding and better quality the crops, the more
money they will make."
</P>
<P>
"In this way, it jerked up China's grain output steadily in the
past decades, and helped continually improve the life quality of
rural Chinese," said Wu, who is also an associate research fellow
with the Academy of Social Sciences in Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
China produced a record 480 million tons of grain last year.
Meanwhile, the average annual income for rural residents rose nine
percent to 1,900 yuan (228.9 US dollars); the growth nearly
tripled that for urban people earnings.
</P>
<P>
As early land contracts started to expire in recent years, the
Chinese government declared its commitment, as early as 1993, to
keep to its rural land policy by prolonging the contract term by
another 30 years. And the real work began in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Upholds Consistent Land Policy (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Statistics from the the Ministry of Agriculture show that more
than half of the Chinese villages had renewed the former land
contracts by the end of last year. Again, the spearheading Anhui
has basically finished the job.
</P>
<P>
But problems also arose: people found it impossible to repeat
the former practice of equally dividing the farmland among
villagers, due to changes in the rural economic layout in the
past ten-plus years. While the number and size of small townships
have been on the rise, so has the rural population, and the arable
land coverage has only increased to a small extent.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to such difficulties, a national conference on rural
work early this year stressed that the renewal of land contracts
was an indispensable policy that is in accordance with the
development of the productive forces in rural China, safeguards
the interests of Chinese peasantry and makes possible a stable,
rural China.
</P>
<P>
The government then decided to abandon the past practice of
land distribution and stick to the former contract plan, by which
death of the aged and new births have no effect on how much land a
family can lease.
</P>
<P>
Chinese farmers fully approve of this policy: an official
survey indicated that at least 98 percent of the rural households
are willing to hold the land they contracted 15 years ago for
another 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Shi Yongjin said, "All the people in my village are keen on
contracting the land again."
</P>
<P>
A new step by the government also lifted a ban on land
sub-contracting for more efficient use of the farming resources.
As long as the land is reserved for crop-growing, the farmers may
get official permission to sub-contract the land they leased from
the village to other people.
</P>
<P>
"This may open the once self-sufficient rural areas to market
competition, push the farmers to market, and facilitate the
transition of rural economy to a modern scale management mode from
the traditional one of scattered household production," said Wen
Tiejun, a research fellow from the research center of the Ministry
of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Farmers have tasted the sweetness of the new policy already,
especially in top grain-producing provinces of Hebei, Shandong and
Anhui. By joining hands with fellow villagers, they raised the
labor efficiency by using modern agro-machines on an even greater
space of land and selling the grain in large quantities.
</P>
<P>
Just as Vice Minister of Agriculture Wan Baorui said, a new
round of farmland contracting pushed China's rural policy another
step forward while basically sticking to the existing one.
</P>
<P>
"It is not just conducive to a more efficient rural productive
force, it is very significant to China's grain production, the
coordinated development of the urban and rural economy and a rural
China in peace," noted the vice minister.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Leaves Cairo for Jerusalem Meeting in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat left here early this morning for
Morocco to attend an Islamic meeting on the issue of Jerusalem
after a one-hour stopover at Cairo International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Osama al-Baz, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's political
advisor who met Arafat during the latter's stopover, said that
they discussed the topics the Palestinian leader will raise during
the meeting of al-Quds (Jerusalem) Committee which will open in
Rabat, Morocco, today.
</P>
<P>
The discussion also dwelt on issues on the agenda of the 107th
session of the Arab foreign ministers here on January 30.
</P>
<P>
Baz said the 6,500-unit Israeli Jewish neighborhood in Jabal
Abu Ghneim (Har Homa) in East Jerusalem would dominate the meeting
of the 22-member Arab League.
</P>
<P>
Arafat briefed Baz on the viewpoint the PNA will expound during
the two meetings and asked him to convey it to Mubarak, Baz added.
</P>
<P>
Baz made it clear that those meetings acquire special
significance as they take place on the heels of the Organization
of Islamic Conference (OIC) extraordinary summit, held recently in
Islamabad, Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The president's advisor expected that the committee could
activate resolutions passed during this summit to back the Arab
and Islamic stance in face of Israel's settlement activities in
East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians claim as their future
capital.
</P>
<P>
A proposal drafted during the summit by the PNA, Egypt and
Saudi Arabia urges all Arab countries to freeze ties with
Israel. It will be presented to the Rabat meeting.
</P>
<P>
The proposal also called for a fund be established with a
capital of one billion U.S. dollars to save the Islamic holy
shrines in Jerusalem and defend the Arab residents of the city.
</P>
<P>
Clashes between Palestinian stone-throwers and Israeli soldiers
have entered the 7th day, culminated in last Friday's suicide bomb
attack in a Tel Aviv cafe, in which three Israeli women were
killed.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross is expected to meet Arafat in
Morocco this morning before he flies to Israel to meet Netanyahu
on a mission to restart direct talks between Israel and the
Palestinians, which have broken down over a week.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Leaves Cairo for Jerusalem Meeting in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat left here early this morning for
Morocco to attend an Islamic meeting on the issue of Jerusalem
after a one-hour stopover at Cairo International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Osama al-Baz, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's political
advisor who met Arafat during the latter's stopover, said that
they discussed the topics the Palestinian leader will raise during
the meeting of al-Quds (Jerusalem) Committee which will open in
Rabat, Morocco, today.
</P>
<P>
The discussion also dwelt on issues on the agenda of the 107th
session of the Arab foreign ministers here on March 30.
</P>
<P>
Baz said the 6,500-unit Israeli Jewish neighborhood in Jabal
Abu Ghneim (Har Homa) in East Jerusalem would dominate the meeting
of the 22-member Arab League.
</P>
<P>
Arafat briefed Baz on the viewpoint the PNA will expound during
the two meetings and asked him to convey it to Mubarak, Baz added.
</P>
<P>
Baz made it clear that those meetings acquire special
significance as they take place on the heels of the Organization
of Islamic Conference (OIC) extraordinary summit, held recently in
Islamabad, Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The president's advisor expected that the committee could
activate resolutions passed during this summit to back the Arab
and Islamic stance in face of Israel's settlement activities in
East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians claim as their future
capital.
</P>
<P>
A proposal drafted during the summit by the PNA, Egypt and
Saudi Arabia urges all Arab countries to freeze ties with
Israel. It will be presented to the Rabat meeting.
</P>
<P>
The proposal also called for a fund be established with a
capital of one billion U.S. dollars to save the Islamic holy
shrines in Jerusalem and defend the Arab residents of the city.
</P>
<P>
Clashes between Palestinian stone-throwers and Israeli soldiers
have entered the 7th day, culminated in last Friday's suicide bomb
attack in a Tel Aviv cafe, in which three Israeli women were
killed.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross is expected to meet Arafat in
Morocco this morning before he flies to Israel to meet Netanyahu
on a mission to restart direct talks between Israel and the
Palestinians, which have broken down over a week.

<HEADLINE> Gas-powered Vehicles Test on Road in Chinese City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A car and a jeep, powered by
liquefied gas, have passed road tests in Tianjin, a port city in
north China.
</P>
<P>
The powertrains of the remodeled vehicles, jointly developed by
Tianjin Liquefied Gas Corp. and Australia-based Apollo Co., create
a duel power systems enabling the use of either gasoline or
liquefied gas. A magnetic switch allows the transfer from one
power system to the other.
</P>
<P>
Drivers attending the test said that the new energy can ensure
the driving speed of 150 kilometers per hour under normal
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Data of the road test show the clean, energy-efficient,
low-lost gas is also environmentally-friendly. The waste of carbon
monoxide in the auto exhaust can be reduced by 90-100 percent, and
sulfide hydrogen by 50 percent. No benzene or lead wastes will be
generated in the burning process, and the engine's noise level can
be lowered by 40 percent below the normal gasoline-powered
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Local sources believed the prospects of the new energy are
promising. Tianjin Liquefied Gas Corp., one development partner,
has already remodeled all the company's 40 vehicles.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- China has made big progress in
curbing paid news among journalists, a senior official from the
All-China Journalists Association announced here today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua News Agency, he said that since the
country launched the campaign in late January, the association has
received 477 telephone calls and letters reporting journalists who
had abused their positions.
</P>
<P>
According to the letters and telephone calls, some journalists
had traded their reports for money, luxury gifts and
advertisement, the official said, adding that 286 cases have been
handled.
</P>
<P>
These cases were reported by government officials, factory
workers, college professors, and even journalists themselves, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is applauded by the public, the official
said. Some people said that the work will help improve
journalists' morale and professional sense of ethics.
</P>
<P>
News organizations have been very cooperative in helping the
association handle the cases, and some journalists have returned
the gifts and money they illegally obtained.
</P>

cases in newspapers in order to make all journalists aware of the
consequences of such actions.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, Syrian Ministers Blame Israel for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Ministers Amr
Moussa and his Syrian counterpart Farouq al-Shara today held
Israel responsible for the grave crisis facing the Mideast peace
process.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with Egyptian Voice of Arab radio this
morning, the two ministers said that Israel's settlement project
in East Jerusalem contradicts with the international law and
relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Moussa and al-Shara arrived in the Moroccan capital Rabat today
from Damascus, the capital of Syria, to attend the meeting of the
Jerusalem Committee of the Organization of the Islamic Conference
after Israel started to build a Jewish settlement in Arab East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian top diplomat had accompanied Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzouri to Syria for two-days of intensive talks with senior
Syrian officials on the future of the faltering Mideast peace
process on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Certain measures are needed during the Jerusalem Committee
meetings in order to make Israel understand that peace and
settlement do not go together," al-Shara told the radio.
</P>
<P>
Moussa stressed the need to firmly confront the Israeli
settlement activities through Arab and Islamic diplomacy and carry
out the resolutions adopted at the recent Organization of the
Islamic Conference held in Islamabad, Pakistan, to freeze ties
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA), Egypt and Saudi Arabia have
urged all Arab countries to suspend moves towards normalizing
relations with the Jewish state, a proposal to be presented to the
Rabat meetings to save Jerusalem, a holy city for Christians, Jews
and Muslims alike.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also called upon the U.S. to play the role of
a fair mediator as the main sponsor of the Mideast peace march
which has been endangered by the Israeli policy.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross will meet with PNA President
Yasser Arafat in Rabat today and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu later in Jerusalem on a mission to restart direct talks
between the two sides that have broken down over a week.

<HEADLINE> Israel Deploys Tanks in Anticipation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Israel deployed tanks today
around major Palestinian cities in anticipation of widespread
Palestinian rioting during Sunday's Land Day mass demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
The order to deploy tanks near the entrances to Palestinian
cities was given by Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai after
holding urgent consultations Wednesday night with senior
security officials on the current situation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, troop reinforcements were also deployed along the
Green Line in order to prevent Palestinian violence. Mordechai
also ordered the continuation of the total closure on the
Palestinian territories of West Bank and Gaza Strip, which was
imposed following last Friday's suicide bombing in central Tel
Aviv that killed four people and wounded dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said that while Israel hoped to advance the peace
process with the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), it could
not do before the PNA was determined to combat terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In a move to escalate the current tension, Fatah Movement,
mainstream faction of the Palestinian Liberation Organization
(PLO) led by PNA President Yasser Arafat, has decided to stage
"powerful" demonstrations to mark this year's Land Day across
the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations were aimed at protesting Israeli policies
to expand settlements, especially its move to build a Jewish
neighborhood in Har Homa in the disputed East
Jerusalem. Palestinian Council held a meeting Wednesday in the
West Bank city of Rmallah, north of Jerusalem, to coordinate the
protest plans.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Arab leaders have also planned to hold large
demonstrations across the country to mark Land Day in a show of
support for the Palestinians in their fight against Israeli
settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
Bracing for possible violence, Israeli police are also on
maximum alert. Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani will
consult with senior police officials tonight to discuss security
arrangements for the Land Day marches and demonstrations within
the country.
</P>
<P>
While Fatah called for peaceful demonstrations, the definition
of peaceful protests apparently included throwing stones and
fire-bombs at Israeli soldiers, moves that could trigger
bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
For the past week, Palestinian youths have been throwing
stones and petro-bombs in clashes with Israeli soldiers, who
fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse them. The clashes
did not escalate into major bloodshed mainly due to the efforts
by the Palestinian police who tried hard to separate the
protesters from Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Clashes continued Wednesday night in the territories. About
20 people were injured as Israeli soldiers fired tear gas and
rubber bullets to disperse stone-throwing Palestinian youths in
Ramallah and the Erez Checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians have observed the Land Day since 1976 when six
Israeli Arab villagers were killed and dozens of others wounded
by Israeli police who opened fire to quell their protests over
Israel's expropriation of land.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Cuts Charges on Phone Calls in E. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Posts and
Telecommunications Corporation (KPTC) has announced a 62 percent
reduction in tariffs for telephone calls within the eastern
African region.
</P>
<P>
KPTC Managing Director Jan Mutai said on Tuesday that rates
for calls from Nairobi to Tanzania's capital Dar es Salaam and
Uganda's capital Kampala would drop by 42.9 percent to 28 Kenyan
Shillings (about 0.5 U.S. Dollar) per minute from 49 Shillings.
</P>
<P>
He said his corporation had simplified charge bands to both
domestic and eastern African region.
</P>
<P>
The local calls will be charged at the rate of 1.17 Shillings
per minute, a 83.3 percent drop from seven Shillings per minute.
</P>
<P>
The radius for local calls had been increased from 30
kilometers to 60 kilometers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, a call from Nairobi to Nakuru which is beyond 60
kilometers radius would be the same in tariff as calls from
Nairobi to any parts of Uganda and Tanzania, he added.
</P>
<P>
The reduction follows an earlier cut on tariffs for
international calls which lowered by 33.3 percent since January.
</P>
<P>
Mutai noted that the new tariff structure was part of the
corporation's efforts to align its network to the emerging
worldwide trend toward simpler network systems.
</P>
<P>
"The objective is to create flexibility, reduce charge bands
and respond to technological changes that are making time the
basis of charging rather than distance," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan official stressed that the move was the
corporation's contribution toward improving the performance of
the East African Cooperation.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- China's capital Beijing has seen
a rapid growth in the export and import of techonology over the
past few years, with the total trade volume valued at four billion
US dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics released by the Beijing Municipal
Commission of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the city
imported 2,998 items of technology last year at a total cost of
three billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city's overall export volume of technology also
rosed by 350 percent from 1995 to one billion dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The city's total export volume of technology was still less
than 440,000 dollars in 1980. It develops so quickly," said Wei
Guo, director of the Commission's Foreign Trade Management Section.
</P>
<P>
The commission now has taken measures to help the city continue
its growth of exports of large complete sets of equipment and
machinery this year, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing received two big orders from Iran last year, one for
equipment and facilities for the Teheran subway project, and the
other for ships. Each of the two orders were worth 150 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Legend Company in Beijing, a giant Chinese computer
manufacturer, also sold a total of 20 million dollars-worth
computers and computer components to the U.S and Hong Kong last
year.
</P>
<P>
"The 4,000 new and high-tech enterprises in the Beijing New and
High-tech Industrial Development Zone, and the 4,000
foreign-funded ventures have turned out to be major players of
technological export," the official said.
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 major enterprises in the city have upgraded their
equipment and technology by introducing advanced know-how from
abroad over the past years, he said, adding that these enterprises
had started exporting their own technological items.
</P>
<P>
A technology trade fair will be held here within this year,
which is co-sponsored by Beijing and Hanoi, the Vietnamese
capital, to boost bilateral trade, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given by the Beijing Municipal Government to
help technology export projects obtain credit loans and refund
their taxes, and develop trade with Japan and other countries in
Europe and North America, he said.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Urges US to Stop Israel from Building Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-four Kuwaiti members
of parliament (MP) signed a petition Wednesday asking
U.S. President Bill Clinton for his intervention to stop Israel
from building new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The MPs said in the letter, a copy of which obtained today,
that the U.S. veto of the U.N. Security Council resolution
demanding Israel to stop the settlement plan has "shocked and
pained them."
</P>
<P>
The veto represented "a green signal for Israel to go ahead in
the project and angered the feeling of over one billion Muslims
around the globe," it said.
</P>
<P>
The city of Jerusalem is linked to "our Islamic faith, Arab
culture and identity," they said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has started to build the widely criticized settlement in
East Jerusalem in defiance of the strong opposition of the
Palestinians and accusation from the world Islamic community.
</P>
<P>
"We hope, Mr. President, that you would intervene to stop the
construction of the Jewish settlement. We are aware that such a
provocation to our faith will return the whole region to tension
and anger," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait had officially condemned the Israeli move and said it
jeopardized peace effort in the region.
</P>
<P>
In another development Wednesday, hundreds of Kuwaiti students
held a public rally to protest against the Jewish
settlement, during which two Israeli flags were burnt.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Removes Water Hyacinth at Power Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- As many as 500,000 tons of water
hyacinth that accumulated at the Owen Falls dam in eastern Uganda
have been completely removed, reported the Monitor today.
</P>
<P>
The last thicket of the weed was scooped ashore on Tuesday,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The weed jamming the dam has caused extensive silting of the
turbines of the dam's hydraulic power station, Uganda's sole
hydraulic power station.
</P>
<P>
The operation, launched by Ugandan Vice President Specioza
Kazibwe in August, was jointly sponsored by Uganda Electricity
Board (UEB) and the Ministry of Agriculture and undertaken by
mechanical means which cost 1.2 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The government of the Netherlands offered 800,000 Dollars
while Uganda raised the other 400,000 Dollars.
</P>
<P>
UEB now intends to construct a barrier at an estimated cost of
400,000 Dollars to contain future flow of the weed to the dam
area.
</P>
<P>
The weeds are covering all bays of Lake Victoria, Lake Kyoga,
River Nile in Uganda and, to a small extent, Lake Albert, causing
a calamity in the eastern African country's social and economic
development.

<HEADLINE> Efforts to Promote Traditional Arts Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Culture Minister Liu
Zhongde today stressed the importance of passing down Chinese
cultural and artistic traditions, and also accepting new ideas
from abroad.
</P>
<P>
"If the Chinese nation does not continue to carry forward and
develop the arts of its own, it will lose independence in the
cultural and artistic field and become a retainer of foreign
culture, particularly Western culture. That would be very
dangerous," Liu told 300 celebrities gathered here to mark the
centenary of the birth of Pan Tianshou, a master of traditional
Chinese painting.
</P>
<P>
Pan is known for his adhering to traditional artistic
values. He considered Chinese painting and Western painting as two
peaks, representing different cultural systems, that stand facing
each other.
</P>
<P>
Pan is honored in China's arts circle as Picasso is honored in
the West.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited Pan's exhibits yesterday,
and praised the artist's spirit.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that artists should actively learn from "progressive
and fine Western arts."
</P>
<P>
Another senior official, Gao Zhanxiang, noted that Pan was a
loyal patriot who always shouldered great social responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Traditional Chinese painting is a time-honored art in the
country. Its symbolic and abstract language has attracted fans in
Asia and some other Western countries, and masterpieces are
auctioned for millions of US dollars on the international market.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of some Western techniques is the latest trend
in the art, which traditionally uses brushes and ink to draw
pictures on a special kind of white paper, known as "Xuanzhi" in
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Pan was among the first group of artists to bring
traditional Chinese painting into universities in the 1920s. He
was tortured and later died at age 75 during the Cultural
Revolution (1966-76).
</P>
<P>
However, thousands of his works have been preserved as a legacy
of the nation.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Li Tieying attended today's gathering.

<HEADLINE> New Acts Needed Before Local Polls, Government Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of local
administration bodies in Nepal have urged the government not to
hold the local elections until after the introduction of new
decentralization acts.
</P>
<P>
Two organizations of the country's local bodies, the
Association of District Development Committees of Nepal and the
Municipality Association of Nepal, Wednesday asked Prime Minister
Lokendra Bahadur Chand to present the decentralization bill in the
on-going parliament session.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the organizations told a press conference here after
submitting a memorandum to the prime minister that the government
reportedly was going to go ahead with the local elections without
even bringing the bill in parliament for discussion.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming local elections will be held to choose chief
officers and representatives for local administration bodies in
the country's all 75 districts.
</P>
<P>
The former government led by the Nepali Congress (NC) party
decided to postpone the elections, originally scheduled to
conclude by mid-April, till the end of June to wait for the
parliament's approval of the decentralization bill.
</P>
<P>
The new acts under the decentralization bill are expected to
give more autonomous rights to local bodies.
</P>
<P>
The local bodies' organizations argued that the process of
empowering local people and involving them in the governance would
be laid back for another term of five years if the elections are
held without the decentralization acts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the main opposition NC party Wednesday also called
on the government to hold the local elections after the parliament
passes the decentralization bill.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's present coalition government led by Chand of the
National Democratic Party (RPP) took office two weeks ago after
the NC-led government resigned following its failure to win a
confidence vote in parliament.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's export posted 115.9
billion baht (4.6 billion U.S. dollars) in January, a 5.1 percent
rise over the same period last year, deputy prime minister Amnuay
Virawan said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the monthly meeting of the Thai central bank's
exchange equalization fund on Wednesday, Amnuay, who is also
finance minister, said the growth rate was higher than originally
forecast by the central bank.
</P>
<P>
He said it was a positive sign for the recovery of the economy.
</P>
<P>
January's growth was attributed to a rise in the country's
exports of canned food, shoes, electronic products and electrical
appliances and furniture parts, according to the deputy prime
minister who is in charge of the country's economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
However, Amnuay stressed that it is too early to celebrate a
recovery, saying that exports in February might slow down again.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that Thailand's foreign exchange reserves
rose to 39.2 billion dollars at the end of February from January's
38.1 billion dollars.

Local newspapers said that Thai imports in January totaled
154.9 billion baht (6.2 billion dollars), an increase of 1.3
percent over a year earlier.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 26 (Xinhua) -- European Union Commission President
Jacques Santer said today he had confidence in the efforts Italy
was making to qualify for the European Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
"I have confidence in what Italy is doing to achieve the
objective of the single currency," said Santer at the opening
ceremony of an exhibition here on the single currency euro.
</P>
<P>
The EU commission president declined to speculate on which
countries might first qualify for the launch of the euro slated
for January 1, 1999. He said that the decision would only be made
in the spring of 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The commission has never considered the single currency as an
end in itself," Santer said, "but as an instrument of economic and
political development."
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi has promised to take
"extraordinary and supplementary" steps to get the country's
budget deficit in line with the criteria for entering Europe's
single currency by 1999.
</P>
<P>
Italy will make efforts to lower its deficit to 3.3 percent of
its gross domestic product -- short of the 3-percent figure
required by the Maastricht Treaty, ensured Prodi during an
interview late last year.
</P>
<P>
Prodi's government has presented a 63-trillion-lira (41 billion
U.S. dollars) austerity package of new taxes and spending cuts
designed to bring Italy's deficit to within the rules for the
monetary union.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing
Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC), today
briefed French Prime Minister Alain Juppe about Hong Kong and the
construction of a legal system in China.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the meeting held in the French Prime
Minister's Office, Juppe expressed his deep condolences over the
death of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
He said that the French government attaches special importance
to developing relations with China and is closely following the
situation of development in China.
</P>
<P>
Qiao conveyed the regards from Chinese Premier Li Peng to Juppe
and praised Juppe for the contributions he has made to developing
friendly relations between France and China.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that China will inherit the will of Deng Xiaoping and
carry forward the cause of socialist construction with Chinese
characteristics pioneered by Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China will never change the basic policies
formulated during the lifetime of Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
On the return of Hong Kong to China on July 1, 1997, Qiao
recalled that after the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration on the
future of Hong Kong, China adopted the Basic Law of Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) in 1990.
</P>
<P>
He said that after the return of Hong Kong to China, no local
law of Hong Kong should go against the Basic Law of HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China will also strictly observe the Basic Law in
making its policies concerning Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi said that the 5th Plenary Session of the 8th NPC
recently adopted a resolution on Hong Kong on the basis of a
report by the Preparatory Committee for the Establishment of the
HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the next 50 years or even longer, China will
strictly observe the Basic Law of the HKSAR, implement the policy
of "One Country, Two Systems" and let Hong Kong people run their
own affairs.
</P>
<P>
Qiao pointed out that the return of Hong Kong to China will
benefit Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability as well as
the development of China.
</P>
<P>
He also said that China will protect foreign interests in Hong
Kong according to the law.
</P>
<P>
On the construction of a legal system in China, Qiao said that
to rule the country in line with law and build a socialist state
with a legal system is the ultimate goal of China.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is wasting no time in its construction of a
legal system, and pointed out that the amendments made recently by
the NPC on China's criminal code have made it a totally new
criminal code for the country.
</P>
<P>
"If we keep on making unremitting efforts in the construction
of a legal system, we will surely attain our aim of building a
socialist state with a legal system," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Qiao also briefed Juppe on the economic
development in China.
</P>
<P>
Qiao arrived here Tuesday on a six-day official visit to
France.

Bill Clinton will pay a visit to Brazil from October 12 to 14 this
year, said presidential residence sources in this South American
country.
</P>
<P>
During his trip, Clinton will visit Brasilia (the capital), Rio
de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, the three biggest cities in the country.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's visit to Brazil will be the second stage of his tour
of Latin America and the Caribbean. The tour is divided into two
stages and was initially scheduled for April and May, but was
postponed to May and October to give the president time to recover
from an operation to his damaged right knee.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian sources said the postponement of Clinton's visit
would mean a six-month delay in the resolution of the two
principal trade disputes between their two countries.
</P>
<P>
The first is Brazil's opposition to moving forward the date of
the creation of the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) to some
time before the year 2005. The Brazilian government believes that
accelerating the creation of the FTAA will prejudice the
consolidation of the South American Common Market (Mercosur) which
includes Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
The second dispute concerns U.S. restrictions on the
importation of 27 Brazilian products including steel products,
orange juice, chickens and textiles.

<HEADLINE> Ministers Expect ASEAN Economic Boom to Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- An economic boom in the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will continue up to
the year 2020 and will help eliminate poverty in the Philippines
and the other ASEAN members.
</P>
<P>
This was the vision drawn by ASEAN economic ministers during
their informal meeting in Cebu, the second biggest city in the
central part of the country during the past two days, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The momentum of growth is so strong that ministers forecast
that ASEAN will be an All-Tiger Club before the year 2020,"
according to Philippine Trade and Industry Secretary Cesar
Bautista.
</P>
<P>
Bautista added, however, that member countries will have to do
their own hard work to realize the vision of an ASEAN composed of
economic powerhouses.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also believed that prosperity will narrow down
the wide disparity of per capita income of ASEAN countries, he
said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the ministers discussed proposals for
sweeping away the remaining roadblocks to intra-ASEAN trade,
expanding their economic alliances to include finance and
services, linking their webs of growth-inducing infrastructures
like transportation and telecommunications, adopting common
standards for products, and negotiating as an integrated economy
with outside trade groups.
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN members have learned that high economic performance
would happen only if they talk and act together like musicians in
an orchestra," Bautista said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the ministers will endorse the "ASEAN 2020"
vision to the ASEAN Leaders' Summit in Kuala Lumpur in October.
The summit will mark the 30th anniversary of ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
At their informal summit in Jakarta last November, ASEAN
leaders requested their economic ministers to develop an ASEAN
vision toward 2020.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Sino-British Joint Venture for Diesel Engines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 27 (Xinhua) -- An agreement was signed Tuesday
to establish a new Sino-British joint venture to build 50,000
diesel engines in China annually.
</P>
<P>
The new company, Perkins Engines (Tianjin) Co. Ltd., is jointly
funded by Varity Perkins of Britain and the Tianjin Power
Equipment Plant, with the British side holding 60 percent of the
stake.
</P>
<P>
The company will produce Perkins-brand phasers with four- and
six-liter capacity, and different kinds of engines. The company
will be able to produce 50,000 Perkins-branded engines
annually before 2001, ranging from 80 to 210 horse power. As a
long-term goal, the joint venture is expected to have an annual
production capacity of 120,000 engines.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin Power Equipment Plant, founded in 1935, produced
China's first diesel engine. The factory now has over 7,000
workers.
</P>
<P>
Varity Perkins Co. Ltd. is a subsidiary of Lucus Varity Company
which has won a reputation for its manufacture of auto, diesel
engines and aerospace products. Varity Perkins Co. Ltd., with
4,500 employees, now supplies the world market with 300,000 diesel
and natural gas engines a year.
</P>
<P>
The parent company has also made investments in Xiamen, east
China's Fujian Province, and in the China No.1 Automobile
Manufacturing Company in Changchun, capital of east China's Jilin
Province, and in the No.2 Automobile Company of central China's
Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
With the goal for producing engines in China ranging from five
to 500 horse power, Lucus Varity Company also plans to set up more
joint ventures in China, sources said.

<HEADLINE> North China Port City Springboard for ROK Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Investors from the Republic of
Korea (ROK) have flocked to Tianjin, a port and industrial city in
north China, finding a springboard there to China's vast inland
areas.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin now operates regular routes by sea and air to several
ROK destinations. In addition, the city's efforts to improve the
infrastructure, including north China's largest development zone
and a bonded area, also offer a favorable investment environment
to incoming ROK investors.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, eye-catching billboards advertising ROK companies can
be seen along the city's prosperous commercial
streets. Korean-made consumer commodities, from electronic
appliances to lab papers, fill stores in the local market.
</P>
<P>
To date, investment in 717 ROK-funded enterprises has exceeded
the one billion US dollar mark. In 1996 alone, an additional 136
companies, mostly from the industrial sector, registered in the
city. Investment from ROK now ranks fifth among overseas source
countries and regions to Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts considered the inflowing investment a strategic
move for ROK investors aiming toward China's vast inland areas via
Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey indicates that ROK investment last year shifted
from the previous labor-intensive areas to more capital-intensive
fields. Certain key ROK corporations have designated Tianjin sites
as their overseas production bases.
</P>
<P>
Sources revealed that Samsung Corporation intends to put three
billion US dollars in Tianjin to erect an electronic industrial
park. The group has already clinched 11 deals in China, six of
which are in Tianjin. Samsung plans to set up China's largest
video cassette recorder plant at the park.
</P>
<P>
LG Corporation, another ROK multinational, leased 360 hectares
of land to form a home appliance production base. The initial
investment was 75 million dollars, of which the Korean side holds
an 80 percent stake. Eventually, the corporation plans to inject
420 million US dollars and turn it into LG's largest production
base in north China.
</P>
<P>
Yingchang Musical Instrument Co., a Sino-ROK joint venture with
an investment of 39.2 million dollars, is now China's largest
piano producer.
</P>
<P>
As the investment environment further improves, the cooperation
between Tianjin and ROK cities can be expanded to more areas,
according to local sources.

MOSCOW, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said in a radio address today that the talks with U.S. President
Bill Clinton in Helsinki summit was the hardest he could remember.
</P>

the territories of new NATO member countries, NATO's military
movements to the East will not threaten Russian security and a
document on Russian-NATO ties will be strictly binding.
</P>
<P>
They also reached consensus on the anti-ballistic missile
defense and the reduction of strategic weapons, the Russian
president said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin stressed that the response to the NATO's eastward
expansion was important, but it was not the only side of Russia's
foreign policy.

<P>
He also said that his country will first develop and strengthen
the ties with its traditional partners.

PARIS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese National People's
Congress (NPC) Chairman Qiao Shi said here today that China is
willing to enhance cooperation with France and together with
France to contribute to the building of a new international

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Seven people were injured last
night in a riot in Pekalongan of Indonesia's central Java province
and scores of rioters were arrested, the Indonesia Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people ran amok, demolishing shops, offices and
public utilities during the midnight riot in the coastal city,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
The mob also set four motorcycles and one car ablaze, but there
have been no reports of casualties.
</P>
<P>
The rioters burned tires and firewood, blocking the street
leading to a boarding school where a sermon by a leading Jakarta
preacher was scheduled to take place.
</P>
<P>
This was the second riot in two days in the city. On Monday,
hundreds of people stormed a stage with stones and Molotov
cocktails. They also burned flags and banners.
</P>
<P>
The local military authorities said the riots were caused by a
"verbal war" between dissatisfied people and local authorities
over the procedures for hoisting political parties' flags at any
gathering or ceremony.
</P>
<P>
A military officer said the three political parties -- the
ruling Golkar, the United Development Party (PPP) and the
Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) have agreed not to hoist party
flags when they hold any gathering or ceremony.
</P>
<P>
However, yellow flags (Golkar flag) were hoisted along the
street prior to the sermon which was expected to attended by "one
million followers" and then the yellow flags were replaced by
green flags (PPP flag).
</P>
<P>
Tensions among the supporters of the three political parties
which are preparing for the May 29 general election, are predicted
to mount, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The three parties are vying for 425 seats of the House of
Representatives in the May election during which more than 120
million people are eligible to vote.
</P>
<P>
"The military authority has arrested scores of rioters," said
the central Java military commander, Major General Subagyo H.S.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says Troops Will Leave Bosnia on Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- United States President Bill
Clinton told visiting Bosnian President Aliya Izetbegovic today
that U.S. troops would leave Bosnia in June 1998, as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
At their meeting in the White House, Clinton said much work had
to be done to implement outstanding provisions of the 1995 Dayton
Accord, which ended the 43-month Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
"There will be an international security presence (in Bosnia)
for quite some time yet, during which time we have to work hard to
do as much as we possibly can to implement the Dayton agreement,"
Clinton told reporters before the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of very specific work to be done, that if done
and done right will make it possible for the nation to succeed and
for people to be brought back into a more constructive
cooperation...when we're gone," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Izetbegovic said that before the troops leave, the peace
accord, civilian provisions in particular, must be fully
implemented.
</P>
<P>
A separate disarmament pact must be enforced and Bosnia must be
included in the Partnership for Peace program under which former
East Bloc countries cooperate with NATO.
</P>
<P>
He said there were big difficulties in implementing the
civilian aspects of the accord, which was a condition for
withdrawal of foreign forces next year.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Bosnian president warned that war could break
out again if the civilian aspects were not addressed.
</P>
<P>
"If the civilian aspects of the Dayton agreement are not
implemented, its military results will be null -- as if they never
were. We could again have war," said Izetbegovic.

<HEADLINE> North China Province Helps Resettlement of Dam Area County </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Hebei Province has announced
plans to help with the resettlement of local residents of Fengdu
County, in northwest China's Chongqing Municipality, who have been
affected by the Three Gorge Dam project.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the province so far has signed
agreements with the northwestern county for 19 economic and
technological cooperation projects, involving a total investment
of 64.7 million yuan. Hebei will contribute 8.29 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the province has also started six public
welfare programs in Fengdu and provided free financial aid in kind
and capital, with a value of 6.2 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Fengdu, known for its rich folklore, is one of the first group
of areas to be inundated when the damming for the Three Gorges
Water Control project begins on the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The county is expected to complete the resettlement work and
build a new county seat on the southern bank of the Yangtze before
the year 2003, in accordance with construction plan for the
gigantic water control project, to be built in the Three Gorges on
the middle reaches of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Appreciating the support, Ye Liansong, governor of Hebei
province, said that Hebei had designated ten cities, ten
profitable firms and 20 government institutions to help carry out
the detailed resettlement process.
</P>
<P>
The province has also established a special fund to support the
program.

<HEADLINE> State Commercial Bank Aspires Overseas Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai-based Bank of
Communications, one of the nation's ten authorized channels for
overseas capital, has seen its overseas business leaping forward
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The bank has started branches in Hong Kong, New York, Tokyo and
Singapore, opening two representative offices in London and
Frankfurt, according to the bank's PR official Zhao Kuan.
</P>
<P>
One of the four state-owned commercial banks in China, it has
already become the agent bank of 508 overseas banks in 76
countries and regions, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
The bank's function as a conduit of overseas funds also has
received active play, raising 270 million US dollars in Singapore
and 12 billion yen in Japan through issuing bonds in the two
countries, the bank's PR official said.
</P>
<P>
The rapidly expanding overseas business has brought the bank's
foreign currency assets up to 30 percent of the total in 1996, and
the profit in hard currency also accounted for one quarter of the
gross amount.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that the Bank of Communications realized
nearly 40 billion yuan in gross profit between 1986 and 1996, with
its assets valued at 397.883 billion yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
Its total deposits topped 251 billion yuan last year, against
the outstanding loans of over 179.1 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Sanwa Expects to Start Yuan Business in Late April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Sanwa Bank Ltd. plans to
start dealing in business in the Chinese currency in late April,
according to the president of the bank's Shanghai branch.
</P>
<P>
Preparing for Renminbi yuan business, the Japanese bank is
scheduled to move to the Pudong Shipping Building soon and open
for business again on April 14, said Yoshiaki Kawamata, the
president.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua News Agency that he hopes his bank can start to
deal in the Chinese yuan in late April.
</P>
<P>
Since late December, China has approved a total of eight
overseas banks to deal in the yuan on a trial basis in Shanghai's
Pudong New Area, an emerging financial and trade district
separated from the city proper by the Huangpu River.
</P>
<P>
As a qualification for the new business, the banks must
relocate their Shanghai branches to Pudong, though they are
allowed to retain a sub-branch in the downtown area, known as Puxi.
</P>
<P>
Kawamata said that he is confident in his bank's prospects in
business in the local currency.
</P>
<P>
The overseas banks can accept deposits from overseas-funded
enterprises registered in Shanghai and overseas individuals, and
can lend to Shanghai-based overseas-funded enterprises and Chinese
firms, according to rules set by the People's Bank of China, the
central bank.
</P>
<P>
The banks can officially start offering yuan-based business
only after passing examinations by the central bank dealing with
both the hardware and software.
</P>
<P>
Kawamata said that Sanwa is currently making preparations for
the new business, such as learning about the relevant rules and
regulations and establishing business ties with Chinese banks.
</P>
<P>
"We need to learn from our Chinese counterpart, as yuan-based
business is an entirely new field to us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sanwa's Shanghai branch, established in May, 1991, will have a
staff of around 100 after its relocation to Pudong, up from the
current 80. The Japanese bank set up branches in 1986 in Shenzhen,
in the south, and in 1993 in the northeast city of Dalian.

<HEADLINE> Second European Mission Arrives in Albania for Relief Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A joint mission of European
experts arrived in Tirana Wednesday evening to prepare for a
planned multinational relief operation in this Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
The team, of about 15 people, included experts from the
54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE), the European Union (EU) and its Commission.
</P>
<P>
Apart from assessing the scale of a relief operation, the
European delegation, the second of its kind in two weeks, will
discuss with Albanian leaders ways to restore order in the country
and its possible cooperation with international financial
institutions in reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a team of EU military experts who arrived in Tirana
Tuesday have started to scout Albania in preparation for the
deploying of a multinational force to secure relief aid.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE member states have agreed in principle to send a
multinational force to Albania to escort relief teams, but failed
on Wednesday to agree to the mission's mandate.
</P>
<P>
The organization has earlier agreed to send a long-term
political mission to Albania, which has been rocked by protests
and unrest since January after collapsed fraudulent investment
schemes wiped many people off life savings.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, a team of representatives from the World
Health Organization, the United Nations (UN) Children's Fund and
the U.N. Development Program and U.N. refugee experts arrived in
Tirana to assess the situation for relief operations. The World
Food Program is also to be involved in the aid operation.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- China is starting a certification
system for medical equipment aiming to strengthen control over
product quality, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The China Quality Certification Center for Medical Devices,
under the State Pharmaceutical Administration (SPA), will organize
experts to test the products. The label of "Chinese medical
device" (CMD) will be granted to equipment meeting international
standards, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Sample inspections will be carried out every six months on CMD
products. The certificate will be revoked if the enterprise fails
to maintain its quality level, the paper quoted Bu Qicheng,
director of SPA's Medical Device Administration Department, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Five medical device manufacturers, which obtained CMD
certificates in Beijing Wednesday, became the first to pass the
national scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
All these enterprises have established a quality control system
and manufacture products in line with international technical
standards. They also carry out occupational training for their
employees.

LONDON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Newcastle are expected to sign
Bradford star Des Hamilton later on Wednesday in a deal which
could signal the exit of unsettled French star David Ginola from
the Premiership club.
</P>
<P>
The highly-rated 20-year-old midfielder spent early Wednesday

Like Ginola, Hamilton is a predominantly left-footed player,
who became a regular in the Bradford side at the age of 18.
</P>
<P>
Speculation that Ginola wants to leave Newcastle has mounted
since Dalglish took over from Kevin Keegan in January.

<HEADLINE> East Chinese Vender Leads West Xinjiang in Small Commodities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Luo Yin, a diminutive fellow in
his forties, has created an entrepreneurial miracle by linking
east China to northwest Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region via a
small commodities business.
</P>
<P>
Walking out of the Urumqi Railway Station, passengers will soon
see a tall building which is Luo's latest success: the Xinjiang
Commerce and Trade City, also known as the Zhejiang Yiwu Small
Commodity Wholesale Market.
</P>
<P>
Yiwu is Luo's hometown in east China's coastal Zhejiang
Province, and also China's largest small commodity wholesale
market.
</P>
<P>
As a teenager, the southerner was a vender, hawking his wares
in Guangdong, Shandong and Yunnan provinces. But he soon
discovered Xinjiang was virgin territory for small commodities,
and in 1980 Luo started his career as a pioneer in opening up the
small commodity market in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, Luo bought an unprofitable Xinhua Hotel
located along Zhongshan Road and transformed part of it into a
wholesale and retail market for small commodities. Public response
was good, and Luo's brainchild is now well-known in business
circles.
</P>
<P>
His activities also have helped to develop two other markets
nearby.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1980s, Luo set his sights on a hostel close to the
railway station and turned it into a market, which he designed
himself. He then acquired a hotel nearby, and soon a new
commercial center began to take shape.
</P>
<P>
Luo's contributions have aroused attention from governments.
Feeling the westward shift of China's economic development,
officials from his hometown Yiwu came to Urumqi and agreed with
their counterparts there to co-establish a large-scale commercial
center in between the hostel and the hotel.
</P>
<P>
Now, the Xinjiang Commerce and Trade City links the other two
markets and has more than 3,000 individual households, 80 percent
of which are Luo's fellow citizens from Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
More local businessmen and consumers are also benefiting from
Luo's good fortune: he and his colleagues have donated over
100,000 yuan to charities, and for earthquake relief and funding
for some organizations.

CANBERRA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian swimmer Alexandre Popov
has married the woman whose prompt action helped save his life
after he was stabbed in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Popov, the 25-year-old world 100-meter freestyle record holder,
wed 20-year-old Darya Shmelyova in a registry office ceremony
Wednesday in the Australian capital Canberra, The Australian Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
Shmelyova, who was with Popov in August last year when he was
stabbed by a watermelon seller on a Moscow street, quickly flagged
down a car which sped him to hospital where he underwent emergency
surgery for stomach wounds.
</P>
<P>
The couple, who met each other six years ago when they were
members of the Russian national swimming program, only invited a
handful of guests at the simple ceremony, followed by a
celebration at a local Russian restaurant.
</P>
<P>
Popov has been based in Canberra since 1993 when his coach
Gennadi Touretsky took a job there with the Australian Institute
of Sport.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) today invited Brazil, a large
exporter of agricultural products, to take part in a campaign
against trade barriers in the world.
</P>
<P>
The invitation was issued here by visiting FAO Director
General, Jacques Diouf, during his meeting with Nuri Andraus, the
vice-president of the Brazilian National Confederation of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Diouf said the FAO is willing to unleash a campaign to alert
the international community to the fact that worldwide exports of
farm products have been prejudiced by trade barriers erected by
some consumer countries.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian sources said Brazil's export of orange juice to the
United States had been highly prejudiced by the latter's
imposition of high import tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Giving details of the FAO campaign to tear down trade barriers,
Diouf said a program, known as Telefood, would begin on October 18
and 19 through a world television network. The objective was to
collect financial contributions to combat hunger in the
world.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Former residence, study and tomb
of Lin Zexu, an imperial envoy of official of the Qing Dynasty
government (1644-1911), are under renovation in east China's
Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Noted for commanding the burning of massive amounts of opium in
Humen in south China's Guangdong Province in 1840, Lin was born in
a wooden house and received education in a neighboring building in
Zhongshan Road in this capital of Fujian.
</P>
<P>
The two buildings, including rooms and corridors, have a total
floor space of 835 sq m.
</P>
<P>
In 1993 the site was rented to a foreign investor, which was
opposed by some 100 members of the provincial committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
Two years later, the provincial government bought back the land
use rights at a price of 12 million yuan from the foreign investor
and allocated another two million yuan to renovate the site.
</P>
<P>
The Lin Zexu Foundation has received two million yuan from a
Hong Kong businessman who promised to donate four million yuan for
the renovation.
</P>
<P>
The renovation project, starting last November and expected to
be completed in the coming May, also includes such subsidiary
facilities as reception halls, public toilets, a parking lot and
green lands.
</P>
<P>
The city invested 10,000 yuan to renovate the tombs of Lin and
his wife, his parents, and his brother and his wife.

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's Controller
General David Turbay today proposed a national front against
violence involving guerrillas, paramilitary groups and different
strata of civil society.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Senate President Luis Fernando Londono Capurro
and Chamber President Glovanni Lamboglia Mazzili, David Turbay
proposed that the political forces should reach a consensus to
create a national front against violence so that there can be
lasting peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
David Turbay said that violence has caused 15 billion U.S
dollars of losses since 1990, twice the country's international
reserves. One serviceman and three guerrillas died every day
during the past five years.
</P>
<P>
"Can we still talk about winners while the civilian population
contribute five deaths every day during that same period?" the
official asked.
</P>
<P>
He argued it is useless to continue traditional discussions
about the effectiveness of military strategy or about spending on
the armed forces or over the guerrilla's unwillingness to talk.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the debate should focus on what the country
has lost in half a century of confrontations and on the interest
in seeking national reconciliation.

BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Xi'an, the capital city of
landlocked Shaanxi Province in northwest China, is now determined
to regain its old glory as one of the country's earliest open
cities.
</P>
<P>
The former capital of 12 Chinese feudal dynasties will grab the
opportunity provided by the central government's decision to

<HEADLINE> Menem Rejects U.S. Request to Reform Law on Medicine Patents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Carlos
Menem has refused to modify the country's law on medicine patents
as requested by members of a U.S. congressional delegation.
</P>
<P>
Menem told the visiting U.S. legislators today that Argentine
laws are up to international standards, said Jorge Campbell,
Argentina's secretary of international economic relations.
</P>
<P>
Protection of medicine patents was a topic at the meeting in
the government palace earlier today between the Argentine
president and the U.S. delegation.
</P>
<P>
Campbell said the U.S. legislators accepted Argentina's efforts
to protect intellectual property rights "but it was obvious that,
for them, our law is inferior" to that of the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The legislation on medicine patents will be "a permanent issue"
for discussion on the agenda of both countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Menem asked the U.S. legislators for their cooperation to
remove the restrictions that the United States imposes on
Argentina's exports of meat, peanuts and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
In mid-January, the United States announced its decision to
suspend 50 percent of its "preferential treatment" granted to
Argentine exports to the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
The sanction, said U.S. President Bill Clinton in a letter sent
to Menem at the time, was introduced because Argentina's patent
laws "do not offer effective protection for the investments" made
by U.S. pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine government has estimated that the U.S. measure
could cost Argentina 10 to 12 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
About 500 million of the 1.8 billion dollars in merchandise
that Argentina exported to the United States in 1996 were granted
preferential treatment.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin to Build Bohai Bay into Export Giant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- North China's industrial hub
Tianjin has earmarked 350 square kilometers of land off the west
shore of the Bohai Bay to launch a coastal special economic belt.
</P>
<P>
The 1994 scheme had untile recently remained largely unknown,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
By 2003, when the municipal government expects the majority of
the infrastructure to be in place, the new area is expected
generate half of Tianjin's gross domestic product and exports.
</P>
<P>
With a large port capacity and a wide array of special economic
zones, the fledgling Tianjin new area will provide a convenient
"green channel" for conducting external trade, the paper quoted a
high-ranking official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official predicted that should the Bohai Bay rim economic
belt take off, Beijing and Tianjin will provide the thrust while
the Liaodong Peninsula and Shandong Peninsula lift th bay to new
heights.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin's middle-term plan is to build the belt into one of Asia's
finest industrial bases and the leading one in the region.
</P>
<P>
Last year, exports from the coastal new area surged 39.6
percent from 1995, statistics show.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Academic Journal Issued on CD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A publication that covers various
fields of natural and social sciences appeared for the first time
on compact discs (CD).
</P>
<P>
The newly published electronic edition of the Chinese Academic
Journal will offer readers easy access to research documents and
other written materials, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3,500 journals have been sorted and compiled into
CDs by the National Optical Memory Engineering Research Center.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academic Journal CDs cover industry, engineering,
agriculture, medicine science, health, culture, history,
philosophy, economics, politics, legal science, education and
social sciences. The electronic journals will be published
simultaneously with the paper publications.
</P>
<P>
Readers could learn how to search for documents on CDs in one
service week started from yesterday with over 500 document centers
and research institutions involved.
</P>
<P>
Some 10,000 scientists and researchers across the country will
keep on close watch on the index-searching demonstrations, told
Wang Mingliang, vice-director of the electronic edition of the
academic journal.
</P>
<P>
Wang was quoted as saying that the electronic publication will
advance scientific research, technological development and
information management in China.
</P>
<P>
China has over 8,000 regional academic journals and 10,000-plus
internal reference journals. These journals, however, have failed
to offer sufficient service due to high printing cost, widely
scattered dissemination, overlapping in content and outdated
management.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the English version of the Chinese Academic
Journal on CDs will eventually be available overseas to promote
academic exchanges between China and other countries.

<P>
MANAGUA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan President Arnoldo
Aleman and his Costa Rican counterpart Jose Maria Figueres met
here today to discuss problems arising from the possible mass
deportation of Nicaraguans from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also studied the common position on
migration, economic and trade matters that Central American
presidents will take when meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton
during his visit to Costa Rica on May 7-9, said presidential
sources.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will meet with the presidents of Guatemala, El
Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama during his
three-day trip.
</P>
<P>
Aleman said that migration is a common problem in most Central
American countries, especially in Guatemala and El Salvador,
therefore, rulers of those nations should take a common stand on
the matter.
</P>
<P>
He requested Figueres for his cooperation, saying his country
was in no position to receive thousands of Nicaraguans who face
deportation from the United States and Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Aleman and Figueres, who arrived here today
and will fly to Honduras for a meeting with Honduran President
Carlos Roberto Reina later on the same day, was held at the

<HEADLINE> Deal Struck on Information Technology Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Forty-one countries and regions,
representing 92.5 percent of world trade in computers and
software, today concluded the Information Technology Agreement
(ITA).
</P>
<P>
Under this agreement of the World Trade Organization (WTO),
tariffs on about 200 information technology products will be
reduced to zero prior to January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Some ITA participants, however, were granted flexibility in
eliminating tariffs on a few products after the year 2000, but not
beyond 2005.
</P>
<P>
The information technology agreement was first reached in
principle among 28 countries and regions, representing 83 percent
of world trade in information technology products, at the end of
the first WTO Ministerial Conference in December, 1996, in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The conference hailed the implementation of the ITA as
contingent, and expected to expand the ITA participation to cover
90 percent of world information technology trade by April 1 this
year.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen more countries and regions have joined ITA since last
December.
</P>
<P>
World trade in information technology products amounts to 600
billion U.S. dollars a year, accounting for 10.2 percent of the
worldwide merchandise trade.
</P>
<P>
The ITA agreement covers six categories of products: computers,
telecommunication equipment, semi-conductors, semi-conductor
manufacturing equipment, software and scientific instruments.
</P>
<P>
It does not include consumer electronic goods.
</P>
<P>
The ITA participants agreed to start considering, on October 1,
the inclusion of additional technology products.

<HEADLINE> China to Film "Memorandum of Three Gorges" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- China will film a TV documentary
about the Three Gorges Dam project, mainly to answer questions
raised by foreigners who have a limited knowledge of the huge water
control endeavor.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for China Central Television, which is jointly
conducting the filming with the Committee for the Construction of
the Three Gorges Project, told Xinhua today that the 12-part
program, "The Memorandum of The Three Gorges," will serve as
official documentation of the country's modernization history.
</P>
<P>
"There have been different views and voices, as well as
suspicions and worries, about the Three Gorges Dam, both at home
and from abroad. Some people still oppose the building of the
dam," he said.
</P>
<P>
To explain the project, the series will contain a great number
of facts that were previously unknown to the public, and examine
its status in the nation's history featuring many of the successes
and challenges to the project, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The program will focus on foreign audience's requirements, and
remove their suspicions," he said.
</P>
<P>
The documentary will explain why the project is enormously
beneficial to the nation and the people, and will have a profound
impact on the development of the Chinese economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
The program also will emphasize that the Chinese people have
the ability to complete the project, which is the result of
lengthy scientific research and assessment.
</P>
<P>
The dam, which will be used to control floods and generate
electricity, will be completed early in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Many people are still doubtful about environmental problems
that will be caused by the project, and are worried that important
historical sites will be submerged after the Yangtze River is
dammed.
</P>
<P>
Resettlement difficulties are another major issue; an estimated
one million people will be moved from their hometowns to make way
for the work.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the documentary will reflect all these
concerns and explain that the positive impact of the project will
outweigh the negative one.
</P>
<P>
Four filming groups will come to the Yangtze Valley to complete
the series, which will be broadcast by the end of 1997, when the
river is dammed.
</P>
<P>
"The program will be a pure documentary. No special effects
will be used," the spokesman said.

LONDON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Everton are poised to snap up
Norwegian stars Claus Eftevaag and Tore Andre Flo from Brann
Bergen before Thursday's transfer deadline.

Defender Eftevaag and striker Flo both lodged deep impression

Everton are believed to have bid around 2.5 million pounds
(about four million US dollars), though Bergen are understood to
want a package deal of four million pounds for the pair.
</P>
<P>
Everton is desperate to strengthen the struggling squad because
Duncan Ferguson has pulled out of the Scotland squad with injury

<HEADLINE> Qinghai Confident in Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking official in
northwest China's Qinghai province expressed his confidence in the
province's economic prospects in today's China's Daily.
</P>
<P>
"Undevelopment in the past indicates greater potential in
the future," Tian Chengping, governor of the province, was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
He noted that supporting Qinghai's development are its own
inexhausitable natural resources, adding that improving its
economy by tapping those resources is the logical strategy for
Qinghai in its drive to catch up with the affluent provinces in
China's coastal and eastern areas.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai, a vast sparsely-populated area on the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau, has the potential to produce hydroelectric power and to
exploit its salt lakes.
</P>
<P>
Three large rivers, the Yangtze, Yellow and Lancang rivers,
originated in the province.
</P>
<P>
Along the Yellow River's 276-kilometer length in the province,
13 large and medium-sized hydroelectric power stations can be
constructed. Total installed capacity is estimated at 110 million
kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
The first 400,000-kilowatt generators in Lijiaxia on the Yellow
River are already in operation.
</P>
<P>
Salt lakes are another important resource for Qinghai province,
Tian said. The province has 27 large and medium salt lakes, most
located in the Caidam Basin, known as the "treasure bowl" since
ancient times.
</P>
<P>
The exploitation of natural resources depends on adequate
funding, infrastructure and technically-trained personnels, said
Tian.
</P>
<P>
After many years of hard work, transport, communications and
energy sectors have seen steady improvements, paving the way for
resources exploitation.

<HEADLINE> Bosman Ruling to Cover Non Europeans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Every soccer player would be free
to transfer under the Bosman ruling so long as he plays in the
European Union nations, the sport's world governing body said in
Zurich on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
FIFA amended its rules to allow players of all nationalities to
move on free transfers, saying once they are out of contract, the
clubs they move to no longer have to pay a transfer fee.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen months ago, Belgian soccer player Jean-Marc Bosman won
a court ruling against his club, FC Liege, that it should not
receive a transfer fee because his contract had ended.
</P>
<P>
As the ruling caused mayhem in transfer dealings in Europe, it
only applied to players born in the 15 EU countries as well as the
three affiliated nations Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.
</P>
<P>
Now it has been widened to cover players who are not from EU
countries.

<HEADLINE> Auto Afficionado Assembles Asia's Longest Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- An auto enthusiast in northeast
China's Liaoning Province has designed and made an 11.2-meter-long
luxury vehicle, hailed by the local press as the longest car in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Shang Yuecheng, 38, an experienced chauffeur and amateur auto
afficionado, envisioned his own car-making project five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The limousine, dubbed "King of Asia," became a reality after
Shang and five other auto technicians spent two months and 200,000
yuan (24,390 US dollars) on the work.
</P>
<P>
"It is really tough to tackle the problems such as building a
weight-supporting structure for such a car," Shang said.
</P>
<P>
The colossal four-door vehicle is 11.2 meters in length and
1.94 meters wide. The distance between the front and rear wheels
is 10.18 meters. Road tests show that the car can carry a maximum
weight of six tons while maintaining a speed of 100 kilometers per
hour.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that the luxurious interior of the sedan is a
match for the big-name brands, as it has a full range of
amenities, including a mini-bar, an air-conditioner, a color TV
set, a refrigerator, a mobile phone, a VCD player and genuine
leather seats.
</P>
<P>
The maximum seating capacity is ten people, "enough for a
small meeting," he added.
</P>
<P>
A local TV station searched all available references and
labeled the car longest in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The car has caused a sensation in surrounding areas. Several
deluxe hotels in Beijing, Shanghai, and Dalian have already shown
strong interest in buying the car. But Shang has another idea in
mind.
</P>
<P>
"I expect to present the car to Mr. Tung Chee-Hwa, the first
chief executive of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, when
Hong Kong returns to the motherland," he said.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian PM Dissatisfied With Agricultural Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian Prime Minister Pavel
Lazarenko expressed deep dissatisfaction Wednesday with the
country's agricultural output.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the National Irrigation Seminar held in the Black
Sea port of Odessa, Lazarenko said Ukraine has the best irrigation
network in Europe, but its crop harvests have been slipping in the
past few years.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the harvest decline on state farm leaders, saying
they are more used to wait for government help than to help
themselves, ignoring that the country is transforming to a free
market economy.
</P>
<P>
Due to these inept officials, most of the 2.5 million hectares
of irrigated area have been wasted, complained the Prime
Minister. This caused tremendous losses for the country. Harvest
decreased by about 1 million tons in the southern provinces last
year.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine reaped 25.4 million tons of crops in 1996, a record low
in a matter of five years since Ukraine gained independence in
1991.
</P>
<P>
Lazarenko said the Ministry of Agriculture and Food failed to
become the engine to drive the agricultural modernization, short
of even explicit policies that can guarantee the reasonable use of
soil, fertilizer and technology.
</P>
<P>
"`Bumper harvest is the ground for economic stability of the
whole country," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Advances in Lipton Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras advanced to the
semifinals of the 4.45 million US dollars Lipton Championships on
Wednesday in a walkover after a freak accident befell his
quarterfinal round opponent.
</P>
<P>
Hendrik Dreekman of Germany sprained an ankle walking back to
his hotel in downtown Miami on Tuesday evening and was forced to
withdraw from the quarterfinal match.
</P>
<P>
The day's real drama was reserved for the women's quarterfinal
between third-seeded Jana Novotna of the Czech Republic and
eighth-seeded Iva Majoli of Croatia. Novotna eventually won the
two hour and 24-minute cliff-hanger 6-3, 2-6, 7-6 (9-7.)
</P>
<P>
Novotna, ranked fourth and Majoli, ranked 10th, battled evenly
in the first two sets.
</P>
<P>
In the decisive third set, Novotna jumped to a 3-1 lead, but
twice failed to serve out the match at 5-4 and 6-5, which sent the
set to a tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
Novotna missed her first match point at 6-5, slicing an
approach shot wide. At 7-6, she faltered again with a wild
forehand error. Instead, it was Majoli, steady throughout the
match, who gave away the third match point with a smash wide.
</P>
<P>
Dreekman's withdrawal followed a curious tournament tradition
of players suffering strange accidents and injuries at The Lipton.
</P>
<P>
The most notorious occurred in 1989 when Thomas Muster of
Austria was hit by a car outside his hotel in Miami, the night
before his final with Ivan Lendl. The injury took Muster off the
tour for six months.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Goran Ivanisevic defaulted in the final with Andre
Agassi after three games, suffering from a stiff neck, a problem
he had sustained during the night.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Sampras had delayed the start of the final for two
hours with stomach problems, before defeating Agassi for the title.
</P>
<P>
Boris Becker claimed food poisoning from fish before
withdrawing from the event in 1989.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Becker advanced to the third round without playing a
match when second-round opponent, Gianluca Pozzi, was rushed to
the hospital with appendicitis. Becker withdrew with the flu one
round later.

PARIS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, the chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) of
China, today had a meeting with the president of the French
Senate, Rene Monory, in the latter's office in the Luxembourg
Palace.
</P>
<P>

playing an important role in the political life of their own
countries, and that the relationship between the NPC and the
French Parliament is an important part of the overall Sino-French
relations.
</P>
<P>
"My visit is the first by a NPC chairman of China to France. I
hope that this visit will be able to attain the goal of further
strengthening Sino-French relations and increasing friendly
exchanges and cooperation between the NPC and the French
Parliament," he said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Germany's Thyssen, Krupp Seal Steel Merger Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 26 (Xinhua) -- After one week's negotiations amid
mass demonstrations by steelworkers, Germany's two biggest
steelmakers Thyssen and Krupp-Hoesch this evening signed a
principle agreement to merge their steel operations.
</P>
<P>
If approved by the two companies' supervisory boards, the
merger will create Europe's biggest steel concern and the
fifth-biggest in the world with an annual output of 17 million
tons of steel.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed today by Thyssen boss Dieter Vogel
and his Krupp counterpart Gerhard Cromme, Thyssen would have a 60
percent stake in the joint steel company and take over its
management while Krupp-Hoesch would hold the rest of 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Vogel and Cromme expressed the optimism that the merger would
create "a market-leading and highly efficient steel company".
</P>
<P>
Both companies also assured in the agreement that they would
refrain from major layoffs as a result of the merger.
</P>
<P>
But an official of the North Rhine-Westphalia state which
brokered the negotiations said earlier that about 7,900 jobs in
the two companies' steel units would have to phased out through
natural wastage in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
According to Wolfgang Clement, Economics Minister of North
Rhine-Westphalia, about 4,300 of the 7,900 jobs to be phased out
are directedly related to the merger. The remaining 3,600 have
been originally planned by the two companies before the merger
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Krupp's unprofitable steel mill in Dortmund will be the biggest
casualty of the merger. Its current workforce of 5,700 will be
reduced to 2,100 by the year 2002, Clement said.
</P>
<P>
Untouched by the announcement that their jobs would be safe,
steel workers of both Thyssen and Krupp continued their strikes on
Wednesday, with Dieter Kroll, who heads the works council of
Thyssen's steel unit in Duisburg, issued an ultimatum demanding
that the two companies present a written guarantee before April 7
to make sure that no one will be laid off as a result of the
merger.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, kettle will explode here," he warned.
</P>
<P>
According to a joint statement issued by the two companies this
evening, talks will be held with works council and trade unions on
how to implement the merger agreement.

<HEADLINE> 41 Participants Strike Deal on Information Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- 41 participants, representing 92.5
percent of world trade in computers, software and other
information technology products, concluded here today the
Information Technology Agreement (ITA).
</P>
<P>
Under the ITA of the World Trade Organization (WTO), tariffs on
some 200 information technology products will be reduced to zero
no later than January 1, 2000 in a four-stage equal reduction of
25 percent per stage by July 1, 1997, January 1, 1998 and January
1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, Costa Rica, Indonesia, India, Korea, Malaysia, Chinese
Taipei and Thailand have been granted flexibility to eliminate
their tariffs on a few products after the year 2000 but not beyond
2005.
</P>
<P>
The ITA was first reached in principle by 28 members,
representing about 83 percent of world trade in information
technology products, at the end of the first WTO Ministerial
Conference held in December, 1996 in Singapore. A declaration then
provides that the implementation of the ITA is contingent on
expanding its participation to cover approximately 90 percent of
world trade in this sector by April 1, 1997. Since last December,
13 other WTO members have come on board.
</P>
<P>
Two more WTO members, the Philippines and El Salvador, have
indicated their intention to join in the near future.
</P>
<P>
World trade in information technology products is significant,
about 600 billion U.S. dollars annually, accounting for about 10.2
percent of world merchandise trade. There are six main categories
of products covered by the agreement: computers, telecom
equipment, semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment,
software, and scientific instruments. The ITA does not cover
consumer electronic goods.
</P>
<P>
The participants agreed that the first set of consultations on
additional product coverage would begin on October 1, 1997. These
consultations will be completed during 1998 with a view to the
entry into force of the revised schedules no later than January 1,
1999.

<HEADLINE> Two Passenger Plane Giants Locked in Dogfight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Boeing Company and Airbus
industrie, the world's two superpowers in passenger planes have
been locked in dogfight due to the bankruptcy of Netherland's
Focker N.Y. and the proposed merger of the McDonnell Douglas
Corporation with Boeing.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the marketing battle is on new orders over the
next 20 years which are estimated at one trillion or more U.S.
dollars. Industry forecasts suggest that more than 13,5000 planes
will be built to replace aging fleets and accommodate the growing
demand for air travel, particularly in heavily populated
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
When pressed for their definition of victory in this
trillion-dollar dogfight, Seattle-based Boeing, which has long
dominated the industry, wants to win two-thirds of all new orders,
about its current level. Airbus, a private held consortium of
manufacturers from Britain, France, Germany and Spain wants to win
about half of all orders. That would represent a big jump for
Airbus, which is less than half of the size of Boeing.
</P>
<P>
Clearly, only one company will succeed in its goal, and at the
expense of the other.
</P>
<P>
Over the last five years, Boeing has won 63 percent of the
plane orders, while Airbus has won 27 percent. In the last year
alone, however, Boeing won 66 percent of the orders and Airbus
received 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Airbus hopes to leapfrog over Boeing in jumbo-jet sales by
building a double-decker plane that could hold more than 550
passengers. Airbus believes that there is enough demand to develop
its jumbo double-decker plane, which could hold about 120 more
passengers than the largest Boeing 747 model.
</P>
<P>
And Boeing, with the combined resources, revenues and future
profits from its acquisition of Mcdonnel Douglas, will have
enormous budget for research and development. It has introduced
its newest offering, 777, the larger version of 747.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the two giants are conducting propaganda campaign
against each other. One Airbus marketing brochure depicts a Boeing
777 as an aging stretch limousine painted taxicab yellow and
Airbus A340 as sleek Mercedes sedan. And in a brochure from
Boeing, Airbus is not even granted the respect of being mentioned
by name.
</P>
<P>
But for the two, what is more important is to lure customers.
Airline orders are typically measured in billions of dollars, so a
lot rides on each sale. In the last four months, Boeing has signed
long-term exclusive buying deals with American Airlines and Delta,
while Airbus has signed a larger deal with U.S. Airways. If a
customer is lost, it might be lost for a very long time.
</P>
<P>
The battle is fraught with risks and uncertainties. For Airbus,
if demand for double-decker plane falls short of its projections,
it might have trouble. Boeing, meanwhile, may face difficulties in
digesting its planned acquisition of Mcdonnel Douglas.

<HEADLINE> Parts of New York Plan on Diplomatic Parking Unlawful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Parts of a New York City
plan on diplomatic parking may violate international law, the
U.N. legal office said in a report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Generally the elements of the city program are clearly within
the scope of the host country's power to establish laws and
regulations governing the operation and parking of diplomatic
vehicles," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"However,... certain provisions of the program do not appear to
be consistent with international law."
</P>
<P>
It cited the city's plan to confiscate diplomatic plates from
vehicles which have been towed and to ask missions to surrender
the license plates of diplomats who fail to pay parking tickets on
time as possible violations of international law and agreements on
diplomatic immunity.
</P>
<P>
"In general, measures aimed at depriving a diplomatic agent of
the right to drive by withdrawal of license plates, registration
and other pertinent legal documents... are in contravention" of
agreements which the United States accepted when New York was
chosen as U.N. headquarters, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report welcomed some of the guidelines, which were
announced New York city March 11 and which take effect next
Tuesday. Among the them are setting up a telephone hot line for
complaints, setting aside designated parking places for diplomats
and providing foreign delegations with a monthly report on unpaid
tickets.
</P>
<P>
It also said diplomats have an obligation to scrupulously
observe the laws and regulations of the host country and that
failure to do so reflects badly on the entire diplomatic and the
organization itself.
</P>
<P>
The report has been circulated among the 185 U.N. missions and is
expected to be discused later by a committee which handles relations
with the U.S. government.

PARIS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette today shared with Palestinian Minister of Culture Abed
Rabbo their "very grave concern over the generalized blockade of
all discussion" between Israel and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"There is a grave worry among all those who are attached to
the peace process. There are not several ways toward peace. There
is not but one: pursue and resume the negotiations in conformity
to the agreements of Oslo and Taba," said de Charette following a
45-minute meeting with Rabbo.
</P>
<P>
He said, "It is in the respect of the promise given that there
is peace. It is in the resumption of the peace process that there
is security. Otherwise, there are grounds for being worried."
</P>
<P>
Rabbo told de Charette that there exists "great worry among
Palestinians over the present situation," and that the economic
situation in the Palestinian territories are "catastrophic."
</P>
<P>
De Charette also expressed his worry that tension might rise
again in southern Lebanon between Israel and the Hezbollah
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister today also inaugurated at the Institute du
Monde Arabe in Paris two exhibitions under the theme of
"Palestinian Spring."
</P>

De Charette said when visiting the exhibitions that "Jerusalem
should remain the city of pluralism and marriage of
civilizations."

<HEADLINE> Annan Proposes Two-week Renewal for Peacekeepers in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan recommended on Wednesday a two-week renewal of the U.N.
peacekeeping force in Angola in order to pressure the former rebel
leader into fulfilling the last of his commitments under a peace
plan.
</P>
<P>
The mandate for the 6,500-member force, currently the largest
U.N. peacekeeping mission, expires Monday. U.N. officials have
been frustrated by the refusal of former rebel leader Jonas
Savimbi to fulfill promises to create a new government of national
unity.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, however, Annan secured a promise from Savimbi to
send officials from his National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola, or UNITA, to the Angolan capital of Luanda to set a
date to inaugurate a power-sharing government.
</P>
<P>
But Savimbi has made similar promises in the past, only to
stall on implementing them. As a result, Annan recommended in a
report to the council that it extend the mandate for the U.N.
operation until April 15 because of uncertainties over the exact
date for the inauguration.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations brokered the 1994 peace deal between UNITA and
the government, ending two decades of civil war which erupted after
Portugal withdrew from the former colony.
