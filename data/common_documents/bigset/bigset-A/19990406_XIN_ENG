<HEADLINE> Egypt Keen on Protecting National Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed
Gowaili said on Monday that the Egyptian government is keen on
protecting the national industry.
</P>
<P>
Gowaili told a conference of Egyptian expatriate businessmen
that Egypt is one of the countries which impose high customs
tariffs on imported goods to protect the national industry.
</P>
<P>
The government imposed last year dumping duties of up to 20
percent on imported iron in addition to another 20 percent as
customs duties, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he stressed that the industrial sector must enhance
the capability of competing in the world markets, or it will be
swamped.
</P>
<P>
Egypt convened the seventh conference of expatriate businessmen
on Sunday. More than 500 businessmen took part in the two-day
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the conference late Sunday, Minister of Economy
Youssef Boutros Ghali said the government's present priority is to
promote the development of the small and medium-sized industrial
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Studies are underway to provide loans to the industrial sector
as it will be the mainstay of the national economy in the future,
Ghali said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the government will continue to improve the
investment climate, broaden the base for private ownership and
upgrade government administrations.
</P>
<P>
The small and medium-sized enterprises account for 80 percent
of the value-added generated by Egypt's private sector, and employ
75 percent of the non-agricultural private labor force.
</P>
<P>
The private sector, in turn, is expected to contribute to 80
percent of the gross domestic product by next year.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Senator Decries NATO Air Raids in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Canada's Alberta Senator Doug Roche
had decried Canada's participation in NATO bombings of Yugoslavia,
according to a report from Edmonton, Canada's western city, on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The NATO bombings are morally outrageous, a violation of
international law and are causing untold human suffering," Roche
told about 250 protesters at a rally in the city on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Roche, former Canadian disarmament ambassador to the United
Nations, said only the UN Security Council has the authority to
send troops into conflict-ridden areas such as Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The only reason Canada is participating in the bombings of
Yugoslavia is to avoid upsetting the United States, Roche said in
an interview after his speech.
</P>
<P>
Roche called the proposed Rambouillet peace pact a U.S.-imposed
solution that is too flawed to work.
</P>
<P>
The pact, worked out in Rambouillet, France, would have
provided the Yugoslavian province of Kosovo a three-year period of
autonomy.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's marching season
got off to a peaceful start on Monday when thousands of loyalists
agreed to a ban on marching through nationalist areas in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The independent parades commission last week announced a ban on
the Protestant Apprentice Boys parading along the Lower Ormeau
Road.
</P>
<P>
Several thousand marchers led by traditional flute and drum
bands paraded through central Belfast but stopped at a bridge over
the river Lagan.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) had erected crash barriers
across the Lower Ormeau Road, one of the most disputed stretches
of road in Northern Ireland, according to BBC report from Belfast.
</P>
<P>
A small group of marchers handed a protest letter to an RUC
officer and there was no clashes or arrests, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards an Apprentice Boys spokesman said they were prepared
to have "direct dialogue", chaired by a mediator, with the
Catholic residents of the Lower Ormeau Road.

<HEADLINE> Internet to Shape World Economies: G77 Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The coming century will belong to
information technology and the Internet will largely shape the
economies of the world, an official with G77 Chamber of Commerce
and Industry (G77-CCI) said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tariq Sayeed, chairman of G77-CCI, said in his speech addressed
to the eighth General Assembly of his organization that one of the
most revolutionary uses of the Internet is in the world commerce.
</P>
<P>
He said:"Already we can buy books and clothing, obtain business
advice, and purchase everything from garden tools to hot sauce to
high-tech communications equipment over the Internet. We know it
is just the beginning."
</P>
<P>
"Trade on the Internet is doubling and tripling every single
year. In just a few years, it will generate hundreds of billions
of dollars in goods and services. According to some estimate,
commerce volumes will grow to more than one trillion dollars by
the year 2010," the chairman noted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the electronic commerce will give rise to
intense competition based on the survival of fittest,
standardization of products on the part of companies and
integration of economies by the countries themselves.
</P>
<P>
The use of Internet in a big way, especially to bridge the
information gap for better trade within G77, is indeed inevitable,
he asserted.
</P>
<P>
The general assembly of G77-CCI, which is held every two years,
offers an opportunity for the delegates to share information and
exchange views. This assembly being held here stresses the
importance of advancing information technology in commerce and
trade, urging more energy to be put in this direction.

<HEADLINE> Annan to Name Special Envoy for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Monday voiced his intention to name a special envoy for the
Kosovo region to assist him in a long-term solution.
</P>
<P>
In his statement to the Security Council on the situation in
Kosovo, Annan said, "I should also like to inform the Security
Council of my intention to appoint a Special Envoy for the region,
to monitor and report on developments and to assist me in my
efforts."
</P>
<P>
"I shall make known the name of the Special Envoy after
consultations with the Governments concerned," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The present role of the United Nations in Kosovo is to carry
out a massive relief operation," he said, adding that the U.N.
High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) "is in the lead."
</P>
<P>
Annan made the statement as the U.S.-led NATO is still waging
air strikes against Yugoslavia, including Belgrade, capital of the
Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
Large refugee exodus followed the NATO air strikes, which began
on March 24.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Security Council is scheduled to resume its
closed-door session on Kosovo at 5:15 p.m. EST, the first of its
kind in April.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke out in Kosovo, a Serbian province, in February
last year after ethnic Albanians, who make up some 90 percent of
the province's population of 2 million, have been fighting with
Serbs for independence.

<HEADLINE> Better Image Will Invite Trade, Investment:Rwandan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu said here Monday afternoon that by improving their
images, the member countries of G77 can attract more trade and
investment.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when addressing the eighth General Assembly
of G77 Chamber of Commerce and Industry (G77-CCI) at the
International Conference Center.
</P>
<P>
He said that the G77-CCI can help to create a favorable image
of the member countries, thus increasing opportunities of trade
and investment.
</P>
<P>
The business community was urged to work together with the
governments to remove impediments to trade and investment that are
still apparent in most countries.
</P>
<P>
Image problem is shared by almost all African countries, he
added.
</P>
<P>
To improve the image and to promote trade and industry, the
president, currently on his two-day official visit to Uganda,
suggested setting up a system to promote exchange of information,
an investment guarantee agency to strengthen South-South
cooperation, and an international rating agency to enable
companies to assess reliable information.
</P>
<P>
Now, only 6 percent of Africa's trade is done on the continent,
he revealed, predicting that with improvement of image and
information exchange, most of African trade will be transacted on
the continent.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Again Vows to Continue Bombing on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
again vowed on Monday that he would continue to use his missiles
and bombs to force Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic into
surrendering to NATO's abuse of military force.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to sustain this (bombing) effort for the long
haul," he told a gathering in the Roosevelt Room at the White
House. "Our plan is to persist until we prevail."
</P>
<P>
The president said that clearing weather in the Balkans was
enabling NATO forces to target Serb forces moving through Kosovo
and dismissed criticism that his administration didn't heed
military concerns about the likely success of using airstrikes
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, trying to shirking the responsibility of bombing in
Kosovo that has caused a new wave of refugees in the Balkans,
attributed to the refugee flood to the Yugoslav resistance to the
NATO airstrikes, saying the Serbs were conducting so-called
"ethnic cleansing" and he would not stand for this "as a permanent
event."
</P>
<P>
He named Brian Atwood, the head of USAID, to lead an
interagency task force to coordinate relief efforts, including the
acceptance of 20,000 refugees to a U.S. facility for temporary
shelter.

KUWAIT CITY, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of the

<HEADLINE> Comment: What Lockerbie Breakthrough Tells World? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Monday announced that the two Libyan suspects accused of the
December 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie,
Scotland, had arrived in the Netherlands for a trial before a
Scottish court, a breakthrough initiated by seven months of
intense diplomacy by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and Saudi Arabia later joined the world body in
the diplomatic efforts to bridge the gap between Libya on the one
side and Britain and the United States on the other. Tripoli has
kept its words and transfer the two men to the charge of the
United Nations by April 6 under an agreement reached by parties
concerned.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited handover once again sends a strong signal to
the international community that any dispute can be solved
peacefully through dialogue and negotiations. One-sided pressure
is of no help in the world efforts to seek a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the U.N. diplomacy, handled by Annan who fielded
messages between Tripoli and Washington and London, Britain and
the United States last August dropped their insistence on a trial
in either of their countries and agreed to one in the Netherlands
before a Scottish court in accordance with Libya's stated
willingness to accept a trial in a neutral third country.
</P>
<P>
Currently at the issue are a fair trial and the early lifting
of the sanctions on Libya, first imposed in 1992 and tightened in
1993, which had created humanitarian concerns in the North African
country.
</P>
<P>
In essence, the Lockerbie case is a complicated legal problem.
However, the progress has been made towards a peaceful settlement
due to dialogue and cooperation from parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
The Lockerbie breakthrough has been announced, what for the
issue of Kosovo, a Serbian province?
</P>
<P>
Though different in nature, the issue of Kosovo, an internal
affair of the Balkan country, can also be solved peacefully
through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the U.S.-led NATO launched air strikes on the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, a sovereign and independent member
of the U.N. family, on March 24 as Belgrade voiced its willingness
to enter into negotiations "anywhere at any time."
</P>
<P>
Without the authorisation of the U.N. Security Council, the
NATO bombs fell on Yugoslavia as the world community was stepping
up diplomatic efforts for a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
The NATO unilateral use of force constitutes a flagrant
violation of the U.N. Charter and the international law. Under the
Charter, the Security Council has the primary responsibility for
the maintenance of peace and security in the world at large.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Lockerbie example should be followed. In other
words, the NATO attacks should be immediately stopped to give way
to diplomatic efforts to solve the problem in the Balkan region,
long regarded as "the powder kettle" in Europe.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of civilians in the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have been killed during the recent
air-strikes by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the
FRY Mission to the United Nations said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
NATO attacks, numbering more than 1,000 since March 24 when
they were started, have also injured about one thousand people,
and damaged tens of thousands of homes and other civilian
facilities, the mission said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Civilian targets most frequently came under attack, with
factories, apartment blocks, hospitals and health institutions,
schools, day care centers, old people's homes and sports
facilities hit by NATO missiles, it said.
</P>
<P>
"A particularly extensive damage was done to cultural and
historic monuments as well as to religious establishments
throughout the country," the mission added.
</P>
<P>
Citing cluster bombs and slow activating bombs as examples, it
said NATO forces used weapons and other means of destruction
prohibited by the international conventions.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Announces Suspension of Sanctions  on Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The president of the U.N.
Security Council, Alain Dejammet of France, Monday announced the
suspension of sanctions imposed on Libya after the two suspects
accused of the December 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over
Lockerbie, Scotland, had arrived in the Netherlands for a trial
before the Scottish court.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the reports, Dejammet said that the
conditions set forth in the U.N. Security Council Resolution 1192
for "the immediate suspension" of sanctions "have been fulfilled."
</P>
<P>
"These measures (sanctions) have been therefore effectively
suspended," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The members of the Security Council welcome the report of the
Secretary-General on the arrival in the Netherlands for the
purpose of trial of the two persons charged with the bombing of
Pan Am flight 103 as well as the cooperation of the Libyan
Government with the French judicial authorities with regard to the
bombing of UTA 772," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The bombing of UTA Flight 772 over Niger took place in 1989, in
which 171 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council stated its readiness to suspend these
measures with a view to lifting them in accordance with" relevant
U.N. resolution, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The members of the Council express their deep satisfaction at
this development," the statement said. "They are grateful to the
Secretary-General as well as all the Governments that have
contributed to it."
</P>
<P>
With the letter from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to the
Council president reporting the arrival of the two suspects in the
Netherlands, the Security Council can automatically suspend
sanctions imposed on Libya in 1992 and tightened in 1993.
</P>
<P>
After 90 days, the Security Council can vote to lift the
sanctions, which include bans on air travel, weapons sales and
types of oil equipment.
</P>
<P>
The bombing of the Pan Am Airliner over Lockerbie killed a
total of 270 people.
</P>
<P>
London and Washington last August dropped their insistence that
the two suspects stand trial in either of the country, and Libya
accept the offer to have the two tried before a Scottish court in
the Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> China Appreciates Turkish Stand on One-China Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- China Monday highly appreciated the
stand and measures adopted by Turkey to curb anti-China separatist
activities in Turkey, hoping the Turkish government will continue
to do so.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (parliament) of China, voiced the appreciation
in his meeting with Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit.
</P>
<P>
Li, who arrived here Sunday on an official visit, expressed hope
and belief that the Turkish government will take effective
measures to further prevent anti-China separatist activities in
Turkey, especially those in violent and terrorist forms.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Li spoke highly of Turkey for upholding the
One-China policy.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Ecevit said that Turkey and China enjoy close
relations although the two countries are located far apart
geographically.
</P>
<P>
Turkey attaches great importance to the influence China has on
world affairs and is willing to further develop its relations
with China, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that Turkey has always been upholding the
position of One-China and will never develop any political
relationship with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Turkey respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
China and the feelings of the Chinese people, and opposes those
anti-China separatist activities in Turkey, he said.
</P>
<P>
Concrete measures had been taken to curb those activities, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that there are a small number of people who are
engaged in anti-China separatist activities in Turkey, the prime
minister said that they and their words and deeds do not represent
the Turkish government and the Turkish people.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government and the Turkish people bear friendly
feelings for the Chinese people, Ecevit stressed.
</P>
<P>
Turkey will never allow the handful of separatists to poison
the development of Sino-Turkish relations, he said, adding that
Turkey, like other central Asian nations, are opposed to
extremists of fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
Li said he agreed to Ecevit's proposal that China and Turkey
make joint efforts to develop relations with countries in central
Asia.
</P>
<P>
China enjoys good relations with the central Asian nations
under the policy of good-neighborliness, and respects the
political choices by those countries.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that leaders of those countries repeatedly reiterated
before that they were opposed to the extremist fundamentalism, and
were adopting a friendly policy towards China.
</P>
<P>
China is pursuing an independent foreign policy of peace, and
is willing to develop friendly relations with all countries of the
world on the basis of the five principles of peaceful
coexistence, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"China will forever be a positive force for maintaining world
peace and stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is the second leg of Li's six-nation European and Asian
tour, which has taken him to Greece and will also take hime to
Syria, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Thailand.

KAMPALA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
appealed to the business community in G77 countries to forge
lasting relationships between themselves in order to have
advantage in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
The president made the call when opening the eighth G77 Chamber
of Commerce and Industry General Assembly here Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote speech, Museveni urged the G77 members to break
down the barriers between them and use science and technology as
well as the considerable human and financial resources the South
can muster to complete in the global market.
</P>
<P>
He called for deeper cooperation at all levels in order to
consolidate South-South cooperation and said that the solidarity
which was invoked during the decolonization struggle should be
extended to business and commerce.
</P>
<P>
Museveni also expressed concern about the imbalance of trade
between the North and the South especially in the exchange of
primary and manufactured goods.
</P>
<P>
The theory of competitive advantage must be understood in a
dynamic way so that all stakeholders benefit, he added.
</P>
<P>
The G77 countries were also urged to build up their scientific
and technical bases as a way of arresting uneven development.
</P>
<P>
The three-day general assembly, which drew hundreds of
delegates from developing countries, focuses on information
exchange and aims at bridging information gap among the member
states.

<HEADLINE> G77 Assembly on Commerce and Industry Opens in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The eighth G77 Chamber of Commerce
and Industry General Assembly opened here Monday afternoon to call
for bridging the information gap among member countries.
</P>
<P>
The assembly, opened by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni at
the International Conference Center, will focus on ways to
strengthen South- South cooperation and information exchange among
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
With "bridging the information gap for better trade within the
G77" as its theme, the general assembly offers an opportunity to
members of G77 to explore, discuss and adopt improved methods of
sharing trade and commerce information.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu called for
forging stronger South-to-South cooperation, pressing for setting
up of training centers.
</P>
<P>
Information deficiency is one of the key factors for financial
losses and economic crises, the visiting president pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The lack of information results in insufficient foreign direct
investment in the developing countries, he asserted, adding that
this will not discourage the developing countries from making
fresh efforts to develop their economies.
</P>
<P>
Chairman G77 Chamber of Commerce and Industry Tariq Sayeed said
that the problems the G77 member countries face are big
challenges, but they can be overcome with advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the pressing need for strengthening of the
institutional framework.
</P>
<P>
The general assembly, which convenes every two years, drew
hundreds of delegates from the 132 member states of G77. The last
assembly was held in Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Reppas: Greece Not to Participate in NATO Ground Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Greece Monday ruled out the
possibility of its troops to take part in any ground operations by
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) against Yugoslavia
due to the Kosovo crisis, Greek government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The representatives of many countries had also ruled out the
possibility of ground operations, Reppas told reporters at a press
briefing, adding that to date there had been no request to allow
the transport of troops through Greece's territory.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Kosovo crisis could not be resolved
through military means, but only through political dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"We need a peaceful solution which will aim at wide-ranging
autonomy for Kosovo in the framework of the borders of
Yugoslavia," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that support for the position that no
border changes be made was increasing among the allies.
</P>
<P>
Describing the refugee problem as "the most pressing factor",
Reppas said that Greece was prepared to contribute to relieving
the human suffering. Athens was also looking at how to provide
humanitarian aid to Kosovo, Montenegro and Serbia, he added.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the large influx of refugees from Kosovo, Greece
has taken measures such as the establishment of refugees centers
and 2.5 billion U.S. dollars in aid for Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
He said that Greece would deal with the issue of sending troops
to a NATO relief force when the alliance decided to increase the
number
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that Greece would not under any
circumstance agree to refugees being sheltered in the
Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus.

arrival in the Netherlands of the two Libyan nationals accused of
destroying Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie in Scotland in 1988.

<P>
I am relieved and gratified by this news. This development
marks a vital step forward in what has been a long ordeal for all
involved, especially the families of the victims who have suffered
an irreparable loss.

<P>
I would like to thank all those who have worked to make this
possible. I would like to express my personal appreciation to the
governments of Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, the Netherlands, the United

have contributed decisively to the resolution of this case.
</P>
<P>
I am particularly indebted to President Mandela of South

their assistance and support. The government of Italy provided
critical help in arranging the transport of the suspects and I am
most grateful.
</P>
<P>
I am confident that the two suspects will receive a fair trial
by a Scottish court in the Netherlands. I am also looking forward
to the earliest possible resumption of Libya's normal relations
with the rest of the international community." End Text

<P>
JERUSALEM, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority Monday submitted in Ramallah its 1999 budget to the
Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) for approval, the Voice of
Palestine reported.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Zuhdi Nashashibi told the PLC that for 1999,
the general revenues total 1.6 billion U.S. dollars, of which
local revenues account for 903 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Grant and aid for development projects by donor countries are
preliminarily estimated at 700 million dollars, which is subject
to change with the difference of foreign donors' pledges,
commitments and disbursements, Nashashibi said.
</P>
<P>
The total expenditure in 1999 is planned at 1.758 billion
dollars, which means a budget deficit of 154 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Nashashibi said that of the total, a little more than 1 billion
dollars will go to current expenditure and 49 million dollars to
development projects solely financed by the PNA, while development
projects financed by donor countries will be 700 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The minister also called for exploring new resources to cover
the 1999 budget deficit.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Viet Nam Win 1999 United Nations Population Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Dr. Seyed Alireza Marandi,
former Minister of Health and Medical Education of Iran, and the
Viet Nam National Committee for Population and Family Planning
will share the 1999 United Nations Population Award, U.N. sources
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The award is presented annually by the Committee of the United
nations Population Award to individuals and institutions which
have made outstanding contributions to increasing the awareness of
population problems and to their solutions.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Marandi was nominated for his almost single-handed change
of Iranian population policy. Iran had a high rate of infant and
maternal mortality, as well as high rates of fertility and
population growth.
</P>
<P>
As Deputy Minister of Health (1983) and them Minister of
Health (1985), Dr. Marandi promoted primary health centers,
extending programs against polio, measles, diarrhoeal and
respiratory diseases.
</P>
<P>
He championed reproductive health activities. encouraging
breastfeeding and raising the age of first birth. He convinced the
Government that family planning was not in conflict with Islamic
teaching and that it had great value for individual and national
health.
</P>
<P>
Infant, child and maternal mortality have all declined in Iran,
contraceptive use has risen and the birth rate has fallen.
</P>
<P>
The winner in the institutional category was the Viet Nam
National Committee for Population and Family Planning (NCFP). The
Committee was set up in 1984 as an umbrella organization to
monitor and coordinate all activities in the population policy and
is partially responsible for the drafting of legal, regulatory and
other population and family planning related protocols and
standards.
</P>
<P>
Infant mortality rates in Viet Nam have plummeted in recent
years, as have fertility rates. The NCFP has been recognized as
playing an important role in the country's rapid fertility
decline.
</P>
<P>
The two winners will receive their awards at a ceremony to be
held on June 9 at the United Nations. The Committee of the United
Nations Population Award is made up of representatives of united
Nations Member States elected by the Economic and Social Council
for a term of three years.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Monday that it had no intention to lift sanctions against Libya
despite its previous promise to do so once Tripoli hands over two
suspects of the Lockerbie bombing case.
</P>
<P>
"We need to have additional concerns alleviated before we will
discuss modifying our own sanctions," State Department spokesman
James Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Libya on Monday handed over to the United Nations two men
suspected of planting the bomb that blew up Pan Am flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, on December 21, 1988, killing 270 people.
</P>
<P>
U.N. sanctions against Libya -- including bans on air travel,
weapons and certain types of oil-related equipment -- were
scheduled to be suspended later on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said some of the U.S. sanctions pre-dated those imposed
by the United Nations and would remain in place.
</P>
<P>
He did not specify which U.S. sanctions would be retained but
said generally those sanctions were "intended to limit Libyan
access to funds and material for terrorist activities, weapons of
mass destruction programs and other destabilizing military
actions."
</P>
<P>
The White House earlier on Monday welcomed the handover of two
suspects in the 1988 bombing of a U.S. plane over the Scottish
town of Lockerbie.
</P>
<P>
"This is clearly welcome news, although long overdue," White
House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said, "We think this is a
positive step."
</P>

Lamen Khalifa Fhimah and Abdel Basset were handed over on
Monday for trial in the Netherlands before a Scottish court.

<HEADLINE> UK MPs Demand Parliament be Recalled for NATO Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Some British Parliament Members(MP)
on Monday wrote to Prime Minister Tony Blair, calling for
parliament to be recalled to consider the course of NATO's
military action in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"In our view the House of Commons must be recalled to consider
the possibility of a ceasefire...to avert a human disaster and lay
the foundation for a diplomatic solution through the United
Nations," said the letter signed by Labour MPs Alice Mahon,Tam
Dalyell and Tony Benn.
</P>
<P>
The parliament members said the ceasefire suggested by the Pope
and the utilisation of NATO logistics is "supported across the
political spectrum in both Europe and America".
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Mahon criticized NATO of "changing its war aims
as it goes along."
</P>
<P>
"First we were told that bombing was necessary to force
(Yugoslav President) Slobodan Milosevic to sign the Ramboillet
document. Then bombing was supposed to be necessary to defend
Kosovo Albanians," Mahon said.
</P>
<P>
"(But) we are now told that NATO's credibility is at stake to
justify the extension of bombing from military to commercial and
industrial targets throughout Yugoslavia," she wrote.
</P>
<P>
"Is NATO's aim now to bomb Yugoslavia 'back to the stone age'?"
she asked.
</P>
<P>
Mahon also questioned NATO's stepped up strikes in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Has NATO considered the consequences of this for the civilian
population of Yugoslavia and the tragic implication for stability
in the Balkans? Has it considered the effect on our relation with
Russia of bombing cities without the endorsement of the United
Nations security council?" she said in the letter handed to
Blair's office on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tam Dalyell expressed in the letter his concern on
the reports of NATO using mass destructive weapons in the form of
"Depleted Uranium" shells to pierce tank armour in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"We know the serious result both in Iraq and among some of our
own Gulf War servicemen and women of the use of depleted uranium
weapons. We do not believe that the long term health consequences
for civilians and military alike have been thought through," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Greek, U.S. Officials Fail to Reach Consensus on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou and visiting U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott ended their talks here Monday, with both sides failed to
reach a consensus on resolving the crisis in the Yugoslav province
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Describing their talks as "a frank one," Papandreou told
reporters that they ascertained that "there is not an identity of
views between us."
</P>
<P>
However, he added that the two countries attached great
importance to their bilateral ties and viewed them as mutually
valuable.
</P>
<P>
The Greek minister said that he expressed Athens' views and
conveyed the sentiments of the Greek people concerning the
military actions by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
against Yugoslavia and the need for a speedy end to the war there.
</P>
<P>
As a NATO and European Union (EU) member as well as a Balkan
country, Greece would not send troops to participate in NATO's
military actions against Yugoslavia but to take part in peaceful
operations aimed at protecting refugees and other missions of a
humanitarian nature, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that such special position only allowed Greece to play
"a mediating and peacekeeping role."
</P>
<P>
On the deployment of a multinational force to implement the
peace accord in Yugoslavia, Papandreou said that such a force
would not be made up of NATO troops alone but would also be from
other countries, including Russia, and the U.S. had agreed to
this.
</P>
<P>
He also told Talbott Greece's proposal for a temporary
ceasefire during the Orthodox Easter this weekend, but the U.S.
official gave no response.
</P>
<P>
As for the refugee problem, Papandreou expressed Greece's
willingness to receive a number of refugees in order to contribute
to helping solve the problem but only if there was some
understanding and proportional distribution among the partners.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey would reportedly make a joint proposal to
NATO that alliance members share the financial burden of
sheltering refugees from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Athens opposes the military strikes by NATO against Yugoslavia,
holding that the Kosovo crisis can only be settled through
political and diplomatic means.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Qatar Amir Sheikh Hamad bin
Khalifa Al-Thani arrived here Monday on a two-day state visit for
talks on political, commercial and economic issues with Pakistani
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif received the Qatar Amir at Chaklala
air base. Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz, Law Minister Khalid Anwar
and other high-ranking government officials were also present on
the occasion.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamad was accorded with a red-carpet welcome and was
given a 21-gun salute.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, the Qatar Amir will meet with President Rafiq
Tarar and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and discuss bilateral,
regional and international issues including Kashmir and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"The agenda includes mainly issues of bilateral interest and we
will also discuss issues facing the Muslim world including Kosovo
which is now the burning topic of the day," official sources said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, they added, highly values its relations with all
Muslim countries including Qatar.
</P>
<P>
The visit of Shaikh Hamad takes place within the framework of
close and fraternal relations between Qatar and Pakistan that have
withstood the test of time, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Amir had paid his first official visit to Pakistan in his
capacity as the crown prince in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The current visit of the Amir to Pakistan is part of his
seven-nation tour.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sharif last paid an official visit to Qatar from
June 30 to July 1 last year.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has formalized economic relations with Qatar by
establishing a Joint Economic Committee for Economic, Commercial
and Technical Cooperation. The volume of bilateral trade between
Pakistan and Qatar amounted to 42 million U.S. dollars in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the two countries will sign agreements for
economic cooperation and discuss the proposed 1,600-kilometer-long
gas pipeline project during the visit.

<HEADLINE> Regional Workshop on Internet Begins in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Information technology (IT) experts
from India, Pakistan, Nepal and host Bangladesh began a four-day
regional workshop here Monday to suggest steps for further
development of Internet communication in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
The experts will adopt a set of recommendations for removal of
legal barriers for development of Internet communication,
involving the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 experts are participating in the workshop on "Internet:
South Asian Realities and Opportunities," organized jointly by the
Local Government Engineering Department of Bangladesh and the
Kathmandu-based International Center for Integrated Mountain
Development.
</P>
<P>
"Leave it to the private sector to carve out opportunities for
themselves unhindered," Ahsan Iqbal, state minister and deputy
chairman of planning commission of Pakistan, told the inaugural
session.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the keynote paper, he suggested that private
companies of one country having good skill in the field should be
allowed to "operate" in another country, as this would help
promote transfer of technology as well as boosting intra-regional
trade and commerce.
</P>
<P>
"Since Internet and IT is among the fastest growing sectors,
entrepreneurs should be provided with incentives to operate
unregulated and untaxed for the next 10 years," said Iqbal, who
further suggested that governments should also provide private
companies with security of capital and policy consistency.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that legal framework for e-commerce transactions
should be developed and implemented so that credit card companies
and banks be allowed to conduct financial transactions on the
Internet which is presently not allowed in the region.
</P>
<P>
South Asian countries should be interconnected through "an
optical fiber backbone" to pave the way for a regional information
network, which would facilitate fast exchange of information and
development of regional e-commerce network at a low cost, he said.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the workshop, Professor Jamilur Reza Chowdhury of
Bangladesh regretted that telecommunication infrastructure in the
country was very weak.
</P>
<P>
But the rate of telephone installation was the highest in the
region, and "there are prospects for software export from
Bangladesh" despite certain bottlenecks impeding the growth of the
IT sector in the country, he said.

<HEADLINE> UK Seeks Libyan Compensation if Suspects Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 5 (Xinhua) - British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
said on Monday that Libya would have to pay compensation to
Britain if the two suspects in the Lockerbie bombing were found
guilty.
</P>
<P>
"If the two are found guilty we expect the Libyan state to pay
compensation," he told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
"We would hold the state of Libya responsible for the actions
of those two employees," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he hailed the handover of the two men as a "historic
moment" which would allow the relatives of the 270 victims to
learn the story of what happened.
</P>
<P>
Cook made the remarks not long after the plane carrying the two
Libyan suspects had taken off from Tripoli for the Netherlands.
They would face a Scottish court in Netherland, which accused them
of responsibility to the bombing happened in December of 1988.
</P>
<P>
Cook said Libya had opened the door to paying compensation if
the men were found guilty in its negotiations with U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
In the conference, Cook also made clear that the suspects would
be free if they are found not guilty.
</P>
<P>
"If the two men are innocent they will have nothing to fear
from Scottish justice," he said.
</P>
<P>
An American Pan-Am airliner was bombed up over the Scottish
town of Lockerbie in December of 1988, killing 270 people
altogether, including all the passengers aboard and some people on
the ground.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the United States accused that two Libyan agents,
Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and Al-Amin Khalifa Fahima, planted the
bomb.
</P>
<P>
After years of mediation by the United Nation's
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, South African President Nelson
Mandela and other leaders, Libya agreed to extradite the two
suspects to face a Scottish trial set in Netherland.

<HEADLINE> NATO Raids Attempt to Eliminate Muslims: Iranian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei said Monday that the ongoing air-strikes launched by
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) against Yugoslavia
are an attempt to eliminate Muslims in the region.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the ongoing war in Kosovo, like the previous one in
Bosnia, is annihilation of the Muslims in Europe, Khamenei said in
a meeting with top government officials, including President
Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
He said that the NATO strikes, contrary to the western
propaganda, have not only failed to bring tranquillity to Kosovo,
but have worsened the situation there, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader held western democracy responsible for the
sufferings of Kosovo Muslims, saying "what is happening to the
Kosovo Muslims today and the same thing which befell the Bosnian
Muslims as well as the Muslim people of Palestine, is a
consequence of western democracy, which deals with anyone and any
group opposed to them, in the severest manner."
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said that the sufferings and massacre of Muslims in
Kosovo were a manifestation of apparently democratic but actually
despotic governments.
</P>
<P>
Following NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia, Iranian government
officials have expressed grave concern over the displacement of
Kosovo Albanians and called for political solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi have contacted
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and his counterparts in various
Islamic and European countries, calling for international efforts
to settle the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
NATO began its air strikes on Yugoslav Serb targets on March 24
after what it claimed diplomatic efforts were exhausted to solve
the dispute between Serb-led government and independence-seeking
ethnic Albanians in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Albanian refugees were fleeding to
neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Reduces Zimbabweans'  Life Expectancy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The incurable AIDS pandemic has
reduced life expectancy of Zimbabweans by more than 20 years, says
a United Nations publication, Africa Recovery issued here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Published by U.N. department of Public Information, Africa
Recovery, however, does not give the original life expectancy of
the Southern African country, where the pandemic is reportedly
claiming more than 700 lives a week.
</P>
<P>
The publication lists Zimbabwe as having the highest prevalence
of adult HIV/infection in sub-Saharan Africa, with a cumulative
figure of 1.4 million people infected, or 25.8 percent of adult
population.
</P>
<P>
"AIDS has lowered average life expectancy levels by as much as
10-17 years in some African countries. In hardest-hit Zimbabwe,
AIDS has reduced life expectancy by more than 20 years," says
Africa Recovery.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, says the publication, ALIDS was found
mainly in the territory stretching from west Africa to eastern
Africa, countries north of the Sahara and in southern Africa were
nearly "untouched".
</P>
<P>
"Today no part of the African continent is unaffected."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe was also one of at least eight African countries where
AIDS had now overtaken malaria and other diseases as a leading
cause of death, it says.
</P>
<P>
"AIDS has overtaken malaria and other diseases as the leading
cause of death for adults between the ages of 15 and 49 in
Botswana, Burundi, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and
Zimbabwe," says Africa Recovery.
</P>
<P>
"HIV infection has spread far beyond the original
sub-populations with high-risk behavior into the general
population of as many as 19 African countries," said the
publication, which puts the total number of people affected by the
epidemic on the continent as 21 million.
</P>
<P>
Africa Recovery also says up to 50 percent of hospital beds
were presently occupied by HIV/AIDS patients in some countries of
sub-Saharan Africa.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investors Pour Into Japanese Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investors mainly from the
United States are pouring into the Japanese stocks despite the
Asian country remaining in lingering recession, The Wall Street
Journal said Monday
</P>
<P>
"Fueled by the giddiest foreign-buying spree since the
go-go'80s, Japan's Nikkei 225-stock index soared 14.4% during the
first quarter of 1999," the Journal said. "The rally in Japanese
small stocks during the final quarter of the Japanese fiscal year
ended March 31 was even more impressive: The Topix small-stock
index gained 16.6% and has now climbed above the 1300 mark for the
first time since February 1998."
</P>
<P>
Figures from the Tokyo Stock Exchange show that overseas
investors have been net buyers of Japanese stocks for nine
consecutive weeks through the third week of March. And during the
week ended March 12, foreigners were net buyers of 776.6 billion
yen (6.45 billion U.S. dollars) of Japanese shares.
</P>
<P>
Furious foreign buying has been met with almost equally intense
Japanese selling. During the same March week of record overseas
buying, Japanese companies were net sellers of 550.6 billion yen
(4.6 billion U.S. dollars) of Tokyo shares.
</P>
<P>
Many U.S. investors gave corporate restructuring as a reason
for their return to Japanese stock market. They said early sign of
corporate restructuring were luring them back into a market most
have underweighted for the past several years. Others said the
dizzying heights of U.S. and European stock indexes have
encouraged them to put some of their profits into underperforming
markets.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. investors are in fear of being left behind the market
as well. The factor has helped power the recent rally.
</P>
<P>
"The turn in the Japanese economy will be sudden, and it will
be better to be in that market than out," Steven Schoenfeld, head
of international equity strategy for Barclays Global Investors in
San Francisco was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
But skeptics remain among U.S. investors, the Journal said.
More-cautious investors say they've been burned before by false
rallies, or "bear traps," in Tokyo, and they see no reason why
this time will be different. These money managers say that the
much-vaunted corporate-restructuring plans are largely illusionary
and that the slumbering economy will undermine any apparent surge
in the Nikkei.

<HEADLINE> Business Community Urged to Invest in E. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Pasteur Bizimungu, the visiting
Rwandan president, has urged the business community in G77
countries to take advantages of the investment potential in the
East African region to boost trade.
</P>
<P>
Addressing officials and exhibitors at the G77 trade fair
opening ceremony in kampala Monday afternoon, Bizimungu said that
the range of products exhibited shows the diversity and viability
of the enterprises in the region, demonstrating that the potential
for trade is bigger than realized.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan president noted that lack of exchange of
information between manufacturers and the business community has
been a big handicap in their operations. He urged the business
people present at the trade fair to take advantage of this
opportunity and expand contacts that will help their businesses.
</P>
<P>
Bizimungu said the East African countries, together with
Rwanda, Burundi and parts of eastern Congo, have a population of
about 120 million.
</P>
<P>
He assured the business community of the support of the
governments of these countries to ensure enabling policies and
guarantee security so that the business people can go into joint
ventures with their colleagues in the G77 countries.
</P>
<P>
Present on the occasion were Uganda president Yoweri Museveni,
government officials, representatives of chambers of commerce and
industry of G77 and the exhibitors at the fair.
</P>
<P>
A trade fair organizer told Xinhua that 108 companies from 53
foreign countries and more than 300 local companies are exhibiting
their products at the fair.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Govt to Investigate Premier's Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 5 (Xinhua) - Rwandan government will investigate
 seriously into the charges against Prime Minister Pierre Celestin
Rwigema over alleged involvement in the 1994 genocide, said
Rwanda's vice president and Defense Minister Major General Paul
Kagame.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the Rwandan News Agency received here
Monday, the vice president told a press conference at his
residence Saturday that he was aware of the allegations but would
not definitely say that Rwigema is guilty or not, that facts must
come out first.
</P>
<P>
''When there are seriously accusations against a personality
like the prime minister or any other leader of his caliber, one
has to treat it seriously, and more so carefully,'' Kagame said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government will not be carried away by
"sentiments or emotions."
</P>
<P>
Rwigema has been cited in several trials of genocide suspects
as having distributed arms to marauding Hutu militia, and made
lists of Tutsis to kill in one suburb of the capital Kigali in
April-June 1994.
</P>
<P>
He has however denied the allegations blaming them on his
political foes who want to kill his political ''character.''
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister, also chairman of the Democratic Republican
Party (MDR), is faced with increased attacks from his peers in the
party who accuse him of obstructing reforms aimed at improving its
image which still reflects its hideous role in Rwanda's horrendous
past.
</P>
<P>
Talking about internal scuffles within the MDR party, the
Rwandan Vice- President said that this past will continue to
resurface on the political scene.
</P>
<P>
''I think the past keeps and will keep resurfacing into our
politics,'' he noted. ''It (MDR) does not itself openly come out
and demonstrate the difference between what it was twenty, thirty
years ago, and what it is today, and what it is likely going to
be in the future,'' Kagame said.

<HEADLINE> China, Turkey to Explore Ways to Expand Trade Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- China and Turkey agreed here Monday
to make joint efforts to explore new approaches to expand
bilateral cooperation in economic and trade, cultural and other
areas.
</P>
<P>
The two countries reached the agreement during the talks
between visiting top Chinese legislator Li Peng and Turkish Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived in the capital Ankara Sunday on an official visit to
Turkey, his first as chairman of the Standing Committee of China's
National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased to see the smooth development of Sino-Turkish
ties in recent years and appreciate the efforts the Turkish
government made to develop the bilateral relations," Li said.
</P>
<P>
There are no fundamental conflicts of interest between China
and Turkey, and the two have similar and identical views on many
major world and regional issues, the Chinese leader noted.
</P>
<P>
This is the good foundation for further developing the
friendly cooperation between the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
With bilateral political relations developed, they should also
make continuous efforts to promote bilateral economic and trade
relations, Li said, adding that China had heeded the deficit
Turkey suffered in trade with China.
</P>
<P>
China has been making efforts to correct the situation and
further positive measures would be taken by the government
departments and the enterprises concerned to ensure the healthy
development of their trade and economic ties, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li also said that China is willing to make joint efforts with
Turkey to further explore new areas and new approaches in
economic cooperation. He welcomed Turkish businessmen to visit
China to see the market demand there, and encouraged the business
communities to promote investment and technological cooperation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Given the considerable trade deficit Turkey is suffering in
trade with China, Prime Minister Ecevit expressed hope that the
problem be solved by way of further strengthening bilateral
economic and trade relations, so as to increase Turkey's exports
to China.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed Chinese enterprises to invest, or start joint
ventures in Turkey, in a bid to meet the target of exporting
250-million-U.S.-dollar worth of goods to China annually.
</P>
<P>
He agreed to Li's proposal of sending business delegations to
China. He also said that Turkey is satisfied with its cooperation
with China in the field of energy.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said that Turkey is willing to take part in
infrastructure projects in China as it has advantages in this area.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also hoped that exchanges between the two
countries in the areas of education and culture be expanded. With
the Turkish Airlines starting to fly to China within this year,
the development of economic ties and personnel exchanges will be
further promoted, he added.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Hails Hand-over of Libyan Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I was confident right from the beginning that President
Gaddafi would keep his word. That confidence has been fully
justified," Mandela told reporters in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
He said the decision to deliver the two men for trial in the
Netherlands had been a difficult one for Gaddafi.
</P>
<P>
Mandela reiterated that South Africa would not abandon those
who assisted the former liberation movements during the
anti-apartheid struggle, including Libya.
</P>
<P>
"I refuse to... accept the advice of the friends of our enemies
(in the apartheid era) that we should do away with Gaddafi," he
said. "I do not share that morality. I will not abandon a man who
helped us."
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the settlement which led to Monday's hand-over of
the two Libyan suspects was not his achievement alone, although
good relations between himself and Gaddafi had been a key factor.
</P>
<P>
He described it as a team effort between South Africa and Saudi
Arabia, with credit also due to United States President Bill
Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Mandela congratulated his director-general, Jakes Gerwel, and
Saudi Prince Bander for their role in brokering the deal.
</P>
<P>
The president said he was informed that the two suspects, Lamen
Khalifa Fhimah, and Abdel Basset Ali Al-Megrahi, were delivered to
the U.N. at about noon and were on their way to the Netherlands by
Monday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Annan Hails Handover of Lockerbie Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Kofi Annan on Monday
hailed the handover of two suspects of the 1988 Lockerbie bombing,
saying this development marked a vast step forward in what had
been a long ordeal for all involved, especially for those families
of victims who had suffered irreparable loss.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Annan said "I would like to thank all
those who have worked to make this possible. I would like to
express my personal appreciation to the Governments of the Libyan
Arab Jamahiriya, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the United
States and other leaders and Governments who contributed
decisively to the resolution of this case."
</P>
<P>
"I am particularly indebted to President Mandela of South
Africa, and to King Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia
for their assistance and support. The Government of Italy provided
critical help in arranging for the transport of the suspects,"
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that the two suspects will receive a fair trial
by a Scottish court in the Netherlands. I am looking forward to
the earliest possible resumption of Libya's normal relations with
the rest of the international community," the U.N. chief added.
</P>
<P>
Libya handed over the two suspects early Monday to Hans Corell,
the U.N. Under-Secretary-General for legal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Annan and Corell had conducted months of indirect negotiations
between Libya and the United States and Britain. South Africa and
Saudi Arabia then were instrumental in getting Libya to agree to
the deal.
</P>
<P>
A total of 270 people were killed in the mid-air bombing. Most
of them were Americans.

<P>
LONDON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Jaap Stam returns to full training
with Manchester United on Monday, which means that he might be fit
to face Juventus in Wednesday's European Champions League semi-
final match.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch defender missed Saturday's draw at Wimbledon after
going over on an ankle injury during a training session with the
Netherlands a week ago.
</P>
<P>
But he has responded well to treatment and manager Alex
Ferguson said he was sure Stam will be ready for the clash with
Juventus.
</P>
<P>
It means Ferguson will have a full-strength squad at his
disposal as United try to become the first British club to reach
the final of the Champions' League since the European Cup was
restructured.
</P>
<P>
Both Ryan Giggs and Jesper Blomqvist returned to action at the
weekend after being sidelined during the international break.

<HEADLINE> Drup Stunt Fowler Faces 64,000 Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Liverpool soccer star Robbie Fowler
is set to be docked two weeks wages - around 64,000 pounds - by
his club following his controversial goal celebration on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Fowler, 24, celebrated his first goal against Everton in the
Merseyside derby by kneeling down in front of rival supporters and
pretending to sniff the white line of the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
Fowler is already facing an FA disciplinary hearing on Friday
following a bust-up with England team-mate Graeme Le Saux.
</P>
<P>
And FA sources indicated that Fowler is now facing another
misconduct charge.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman said: "We'll be assessing the full situation on
Tuesday morning."
</P>
<P>
Merseyside Police are also investigating the incident following
a complaint from a fan.
</P>
<P>
Fowler, who has been widely condemned for his antics, said
afterwards: "I would like to apologize unequivocally for my first
goal celebration after scoring yesterday in the match against
Everton.
</P>
<P>
"Despite my actions being taken in the heat of the moment
immediately following the penalty, I realize that they have caused
great offense and I deeply regret that," he added.
</P>
<P>
The player also hinted that having his name linked with
persistent and unfounded rumors of substance abuse may have led to
his reaction.
</P>
<P>
"I have been greatly distressed and hurt over the last few
years by the constant allegations leveled against me regarding
drug use, which have not only affected me but have been very
upsetting to my family as well.
</P>
<P>
"But as an international player and a public figure, I have
responsibilities and a duty to rise above such scurrilous
accusations and I accept that my behavior yesterday was totally
wrong.
</P>
<P>
"I would never do anything intentionally to undermine the work
being done to combat the suffering and social problems that drug
abuse brings to users and their families or to drug awareness
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to say sorry to the Liverpool and Everton fans
who attended the derby game and have also apologized to my manager
Gerard Houllier and teammates for my behavior," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Professional Footballs' Association boss Gordon Taylor
sternly criticized Fowler for his actions.
</P>
<P>
Taylor said: "The PFA are spending literally hundreds of
thousands of pounds on a drug awareness campaign, and here's a lad
scoring and taking the Mickey out of it."
</P>
<P>
The PFA chief also hit out at Liverpool boss Gerard Houllier,
who said that Fowler's controversial antics during Liverpool's 3-2
Anfield victory were just a harmless joke.
</P>
<P>
Taylor said: "It's not the sort of celebration you want to see,
and it's the sort of thing where the manager should say 'Okay,
Robbie, you've made your point but don't do it again'.
</P>
<P>
"There's too many bad connotations. I think you've got to say,
'Look it's obvious what he's doing, okay, you know why he's done
it, we don't want him doing it again'."
</P>
<P>
David Mellor, head of the Football Task Force looking into the
game's wider problems was also unremitting in his contempt for
Fowler's actions.
</P>
<P>
"He's obviously got a problem and someone should sort him out.
</P>
<P>
"There was barracking and some of that barracking was
unacceptable. Some of the abuse went beyond the mark and was more
than mere badinage.
</P>
<P>
"But he's paid a hell of a lot of money to put up with that. I
think that at Liverpool Football Club, rightly or wrongly, there's
a sense that things are a lot more lax today than they used to be,
"he added.

<HEADLINE> NATO Must Stop Bombing Before Talks Open: Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav government is ready to
resume peace talks to solve the Kosovo crisis at any place and any
time, but the talks could only be restarted after NATO stops air
strikes, a senior Yugoslav diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made Monday by Yugoslav Ambassador to Israel
Mirko Stenfanovic in his interview with the Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The NATO has mobilized over 400 planes to bomb Yugoslavia and
their targets are not only military facilities, but also the
civilian ones, he said.
</P>
<P>
NATO's bombing is destructive and as long as it continues,
there is no chance for the Yugoslav side to resume peace talks
with the parties concerned, he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Kosovo refugee crisis, he said hundreds of
thousands of Kosovars were forced to leave their homes by NATO's
bombing, not by the Yugoslav military as Western media reported.
</P>
<P>
Many Kosovo refugees have already reached neighboring Macedonia
and Albania. And those who arrived in Belgrade, capital of
Yugoslavia, have been treated well by Yugoslav government, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government will welcome all the Kosovo refugees back home
after peace returned to the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
He accused the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), supported by the
United States and NATO, of waging wars against Yugoslav army and
that was one of the reasons forcing the Kosovars to leave their
homes.
</P>
<P>
On a peace deal that Yugoslav government refused to sign onto
in March, the ambassador said his government has rejected an
initiative by the U.S. and NATO to grant Kosovo independence after
a three-year autonomy.
</P>
<P>
On reports that former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres has
been asked to act as a peace mediator in the Kosovo crisis, he
said Peres will be welcome by Yugoslav government.
</P>
<P>
Any initiative to end the Kosovo crisis is welcome, he added.

UNITED NATIONS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said here Monday that he believes that the outcome of the
Lockerbie trial will lead to a full and permanent resumption of
normal relations between Libya and the rest of the international
community.
</P>
<P>
He made the comment after Libya handed over to the United
Nations the two suspects accused of mid-air bombing on December 21
1988. The Pan Am Flight 103 exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland,
with 270 passengers, most Americans, killed.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he looks forward to the speedy implementation of the
provisions of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1192 (1998),
especially those relating to the sanctions imposed on Libya.
</P>
<P>
U.N. sanctions against libya will be suspended automatically as
soon as Annan sends a letter to the U.N. Security Council
confirming officially that the two suspects are in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions include an air and arms embargo and a ban on a
certain kind of oil equipment.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 5 (Xinhua) - U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan announced on Monday that the two suspects accused of the
1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, had
arrived in the Netherlands, saying that he is confident that the
two would "receive a fair trial" before a Scottish court.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief told a news conference he was "relieved and
gratified" by the action, handled by his chief legal counsel Hans
Corell, who accompanied the suspects from Tripoli to the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would write a letter to the 15-member Security
Council shortly after which sanctions, first imposed in 1992 and
tightened in 1993, would be suspended automatically.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions include an air and arms embargo and a ban on a
certain kind of oil equipment.
</P>
<P>
Libyan handed over the two suspects early on Monday to Corell,
who flew them to the Netherlands. The two Libyans were accused of
planting a bomb aboard an Pan Am airliner, which exploded over the
Scottish town of Lockerbie in December 1988, killing a total of
270 people.
</P>
<P>
In August last year, Libya accepted a U.S.-UK offer to have
the two suspects tried in the Netherlands before a Scottish
court in accordance with Libya's stated willingness to accept a
trial in a third "neutral" country.

<HEADLINE> UK MPs Demand Parliament be Recalled for NATO Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Some British Parliament Members(MP)
on Monday wrote to Prime Minister Tony Blair, calling for
parliament to be recalled to consider the course of NATO's
military action in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"In our view the House of Commons must be recalled to consider
the possibility of a ceasefire...to avert a human disaster and lay
the foundation for a diplomatic solution through the United
Nations," said the letter signed by Labour MPs Alice Mahon,Tam
Dalyell and Tony Benn.
</P>
<P>
The parliament members said the ceasefire suggested by the Pope
and the utilisation of NATO logistics is "supported across the
political spectrum in both Europe and America".
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Mahon criticized NATO of "changing its war aims
as it goes along."
</P>
<P>
"First we were told that bombing was necessary to force
(Yugoslav President) Slobodan Milosevic to sign the Ramboillet
document. Then bombing was supposed to be necessary to defend
Kosovo Albanians," Mahon said.
</P>
<P>
"(But) we are now told that NATO's credibility is at stake to
justify the extension of bombing from military to commercial and
industrial targets throughout Yugoslavia," she wrote.
</P>
<P>
"Is NATO's aim now to bomb Yugoslavia 'back to the stone age'?"
she asked.
</P>
<P>
Mahon also questioned NATO's stepped up strikes in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Has NATO considered the consequences of this for the civilian
population of Yugoslavia and the tragic implication for stability
in the Balkans? Has it considered the effect on our relation with
Russia of bombing cities without the endorsement of the United
Nations security council?" she said in the letter handed to
Blair's office on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tam Dalyell expressed in the letter his concern on
the reports of NATO using mass destructive weapons in the form of
"Depleted Uranium" shells to pierce tank armour in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"We know the serious result both in Iraq and among some of our
own Gulf War servicemen and women of the use of depleted uranium
weapons. We do not believe that the long term health consequences
for civilians and military alike have been thought through," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Libya Appreciates Efforts on Lockerbie Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Libya issued a statement Monday
expressing gratitude to those who helped bring about a fair trial
to the two suspects in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by the General People's Committee on
Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation highly appreciated
the efforts made by Saudi Arabia, South Africa and U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan to guarantee a fair trial to the pair.
</P>
<P>
The two former Libyan intelligence agents were accused by the
U.S. and Britain of blowing up a Pan Am airline over Lockerbie,
Scotland, killing 270 people on the plane and on the ground.
</P>
<P>
The statement made a point of thanking South African President
Nelson Mandela, who negotiated a specific date with Libyan leader
Muammar Gaddafi for the handover of the two suspects.
</P>
<P>
The statement, faxed to Xinhua, also spoke highly of the
courage shown by some countries and international organizations
that offered solidarity with and support for Libya.
</P>
<P>
The committee voiced hope that the negative stage in Libya's
relations with the international community was over and relations
based on mutual respect, equality and non-interference in each
other's internal affairs will be established.
</P>
<P>
It also hoped that all differences will be settled through
dialog and mutual understanding rather than violence, aggression
and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued hours after the handover of the two
suspects to the U.N. for trial in the Netherlands by Scottish
judges in accordance with Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.N. embargo against Libya was suspended upon
the arrival of the two suspects in the Netherlands escorted by
U.N. Assistant Secretary General for Legal Affairs Hans Corell.
</P>
<P>
The embargo, slapped against Libya by the U.N. for its failure
to surrender the two suspects in 1992, would be lifted within 90
days after Annan submits a report to the Security Council, stating
that Libya has complied with relevant U.N. resolutions.

<HEADLINE> China Wins World Tourism Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 5 (Xinhua) -- China has won the 1999 World
Tourism Award for tourim's "outstanding impact" on generating
employment growth, it was announced in New York on Monday.
</P>
<P>
James M. Li of American Express, a leading sponsor of the
Award, told a press function that China, now the 6th leading
tourist destination in the world, will see growing international
arrivals despite the recent downturn in Asia economies.
</P>
<P>
According to World Tourism &AMP; Travel Council (WTTC), tourism
supports 47 million jobs in China, or 6.7 percent of total
employment, accounting for 7.8 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
In ten years, the employment figure is expected to grow to 69
million, or 8.5 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) is also
an honoree of the Award. WTTC says tourism supports 236,000 jobs
in SAR, or 9.8 percent of total employment, accounting for 8.9
percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
In 2010, it is expected to rise to 352,000 jobs or 11.4 percent
of total employment.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is forecast to generate 86.6 billion U.S. dollars worth
of economic activities in China in 1999 and 18.1 billion dollars
in Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
The Award was established in 1997 to recognize the
extraordinary initiatives in the industry by individuals,
companies, organizations and attractions.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 Award was given to a number of Middle East and
Mediterranean countries to recognize "World Peace Through Tourism"
and the 1998 one honored a group of East European countries for
outstanding economic development through tourism.
</P>
<P>
Li said this year's Award will be presented to the China
National Tourism Administration and the Hong Kong SAR at a special
ceremony in London in November when the World Travel Market
Exhibition is going to be held.

<HEADLINE> Simitis: Military Violence Not to Lead to Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The continuing use of military
violence by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) against
Yugoslavia could not lead to a permanent solution to the Kosovo
problem, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
In a televised address to the nation, Simitis stressed that his
country wanted a political solution to the Kosovo crisis and was
against any act that could lead to a change of borders in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Greece would not get involved in military confrontations, he
said, adding that Greece belonged to a zone of stability and
Europe's power structure.
</P>
<P>
The premier repeated Greece's position towards the Kosovo
problem, saying that Yugoslavia must provide a wide-ranging
autonomy to Kosovo, respect their human rights and promote a
peaceful settlement of differences.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that Greece's actions must proceed in
cooperation with the other NATO countries and in contact with the
Serbs. Otherwise, he said, the only thing Greece would accomplish
was to alienate themselves from all parties involved.
</P>
<P>
Greece would ensure a future of development, stability and
prosperity for their country if they preserve their sensible
course of cooperation with the other European Union (EU) and NATO
countries, as well as the course of understanding and contact with
the Balkan countries, Simitis noted.
</P>
<P>
As for the refugee issue, he said that as far as they were
concerned, the basic aim should be for the refugees to remain near
their country of origin, and all EU member states were obliged to
contribute according to their strength and ability.

<P>
NAIROBI, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Eight international companies have
 expressed their interest in building two diesel power stations
with a total capacity of 110 megawatts in Kenya, the country's
biggest power-generating company revealed Monday.
</P>
<P>
The eight companies are Marathon Power Antares, Burmeister &AMP;
Wain Scandinavia, Deutz UK, Marubeni Corp/Sithe Energies,
Wartsila NSD Corporation, Westmont Land (Asia) Berhad, ABB
Sadelmi/SEMT Pielstick, Hanjung Group and Iberafrica Power,
according to the Kenya Power&AMP;lightning cooperation (KPLC).
</P>
<P>
"The demand for power during peak hours in Kenya surpasses the
supply and it has been increasing at a rate of over six percent
over the past five years," said Samuel Gichurut, managing
director of Kenya Power and Lighting Company, during a briefing
in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Gichurut said the two power plants to be set up would help KPLC
meet demand between the year 2000 and 2002, when 521 megawatts of
additional capacity would be connected to the grid.
</P>
<P>
Electricity, which accounts for about eight percent of Kenya's
energy supply, is the third largest source of energy in the East
African country after woodfuel and fossil fuel.

UNITED NATIONS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said Monday that prevention efforts to promote responsible
sexual behavior must continue in the anti-AIDS combat.
</P>
<P>
"We must help create the social, economic and political
environment to make this possible," he told a gathering in New
York on the 10th anniversary of the Harvard AIDS Institute.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the only hope of stamping out this epidemic
must be an effective vaccine in the long run.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations, AIDS has so far extinguished
over 14 million lives, with another 33 million still living in the
threat of AIDS shadow.
</P>
<P>
The disease is affecting women disproportionately with more
than 14 million women now infected and at least a million
contracting the virus every year.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, women will make up almost half of all people living
with AIDS and HIV which causes AIDS. As a result, some 10 million
children are expected to have lost their mother to AIDS.

<P>
HARBIN, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The inaugural China robot soccer
tournament will be held here in October 8-10 in a bid to select a
national squad for the Robot World Cup.
</P>
<P>
It was announced by the Chinese Robot Soccer Association (CRSA),
which was founded earlier on Tuesday under the auspices of the
Chinese Intelligent Robot Institute and was approved as a branch
of the International Robot Soccer Federation in China.
</P>
<P>
The three-day event is to be held at the Harbin Technological
University, which will also provide hardware and basic software
systems and an artificial platform required by the competition,
CRSA said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
The tournament will be played in three categories: small-sized
robots, computer simulation and robot motions exhibition.
</P>
<P>
The mini-robots competition, playing on a 130-centimeter long,
90-centimeter wide field and a game requiring the technology such
as computer vision, communication and robotics, are run by inside
computers which can send signals to "the players".
</P>
<P>
China until now hasn't been able to entered a team for the
Robot World Cup, which held its third edition last year in France
with South Korea taking the title. The United States were the

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier's Interview with Canadian Publisher (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: Let me ask you a question, which might be a little
philosophical. I remember that in one of his speeches President
Jiang said that the Kosovo question is an internal affair of a
country. And he also said what he had seen was other countries'
intervention in the internal affairs of that country in question,
so he voiced his disagreement.
</P>
<P>
But from a philosophical point of view, when or under what
circumstances, do you personally think or does the Government of
China think, outside intervention may be allowed into what a
government does to its citizens or some of its citizens? Now some
countries are thinking that they should interfere in other
countries' internal affairs. What is your view on that?
</P>
<P>
A: I believe that in the final analysis, the Kosovo question is
an ethnic problem, which of course is an internal matter.
Questions like this exist in many countries. You in Canada have
the question of Quebec; the UK has the Northern Ireland question;
and for China, there is the question of Tibet. Of course, these
questions are internal affairs of the countries concerned.
</P>
<P>
It would not be possible for an outsider to pay no attention at
all to such questions. For there would be comments anyway, and the
general public and the world media would also make comments.  But
military actions cannot solve problems. We respect human rights,
but we must not disregard the sovereignty of a country. If
military intervention is used against a country for a human rights
issue, that will create a very bad precedent in the world. With
that, people would wonder whether foreign powers should take
military actions against Canada, the UK and China over ethnic
issues of Quebec, Northern Ireland and Tibet respectively.
</P>
<P>
Q: What I want to ask is that other countries may intervene if
some kind of disaster or ethnic cleansing takes place in a country,
say the military actions against the so-called ethnic cleansing in
a sovereign state like Yugoslavia. Under these circumstances,
should big powers and their leaders not intervene?
</P>
<P>
A: You have used very general terms to describe these incidents.
I do not know much about the specific circumstances, so I am not
in a position to make any comment.
</P>
<P>
Q: In the UK, which you have mentioned, it is not the British
or Irish Government, but some people from an ethnic group who have
conducted terrorist activities. What is different in Yugoslavia is
that it is the military who are conducting the ethnic cleansing
campaign. How would you comment on that?
</P>
<P>
A: But who should be playing the judge. Now we do not have a
world tribunal or world police to decide on whether to make such
military intervention.
</P>
<P>
Q: Who, do you think?
</P>
<P>
A: I don't think that anyone is in a position to make the
decision. All the internal matters or questions of a country
should be left to the country itself for settlement. If we should
refuse to recognize a country's sovereignty, I am afraid that
would lead to war, even a world war.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Civilians Expelled by Israeli Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-five Lebanese villagers
Tuesday afternoon were expelled by Israeli forces from their
homes in the Israeli occupied south Lebanon in connection with
the desertion of four members of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon
Army (SLA).
</P>
<P>
Most of the deported are relatives of the four deserters who
defected to the Lebanese army on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The defectors fled through rugged mountain trails from the
Shebaa village inside the border zone and turned in themselves
along with their wives and children at the Lebanese army
checkpoint in the country's eastern Bekaa Valley.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli occupation forces also arrested a number of
SLA officers from the district of Haasbaya, about 10 kilometers
north of Shebaa, to the Israeli forces' south Lebanon command in
Marjayoun, for interrogation over the desertion.
</P>
<P>
There are currently nearly 2,500 SLA members, who are helping
Israeli forces to patrol its occupied border zone in south Lebanon
and handling the security affairs in Jezzine, a predominantly
Christian town facing the zone.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen were considered as traitors in Lebanon and its
commander Antonie Lahd has been sentenced to death in absentia by
a Lebanese military court.
</P>
<P>
Amid mounting speculation that Israeli forces may conduct a
unilateral partial withdrawal from south Lebanon, the SLA's moral
is sinking and more members are defecting to the Lebanese
government in a bid to escape reprisals afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with
the claimed aim of protecting its north from cross-border
guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to oust Israeli
forces and its ally SLA.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Set Aside 40 Trillion Yen to Tackle Y2K Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Japan (BOJ) said Tuesday
it will appropriate 40 trillion yen (about 330.6 billion dollars)
in cash at its head office and branches in a bid to tackle the
possible occurrence of the millennium bug problem in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese central bank said it envisaged emergency
situations which include a sudden surge in demand for funds to
stockpile food and gasoline when setting aside the huge funds.
</P>
<P>
With the millennium bug, also known as the Y2K problem,
computers running software that identifies years by their last two
digits might misread "00" as "1900" after midnight December 31,
1999, and fail to process information for 2000 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
BOJ said although it had reprogrammed its own computer system
to prevent the millennium bug from striking, it prepared a package
of countermeasures just in case.
</P>
<P>
According to the package, the central bank will complete tests
by December on transfer of computer operations to its backup
center in Osaka. On December 30, the central bank will print out
data that may be needed if manual processing of transactions
becomes necessary.
</P>
<P>
On December 31, the BOJ will place officials on an overnight
shift and check key facilities January 1, 2000. Then It will test
the connection of its computer system with those of private
financial institutions, and will decide whether to shift to manual
work before most Japanese businesses begin work for the new year
January 4.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) spokesman Jamie Shea said here Tuesday that
NATO ambassadors in their earlier meeting welcomed the quickened
and very important decision of the Albanian government to
authorize the stationing of the US Apache helicopters in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Shea said the NATO commanders will now be asked to coordinate
directly with the Albanian government for the practical details of
this deployment.
</P>
<P>
"We hope obviously to have the Apache there in the extremely
near future," he told a daily news briefing at the NATO
headquarters here in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Shea also warned that the NATO will view with utmost
seriousness at any attack by Yugoslavia on Albania, particularly as
a consequence of its support for alliance operations.
</P>
<P>
Military sources said the US Apache attack helicopters with
heavily armed gunships could spearhead a drive against Serbian
tanks and ground troops in Kosovo. Currently, 24 Apache choppers
sent by the United States will be used in NATO's expanded air
strike operation in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier's Interview with Canadian Publisher (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: Discussion is going on in the U.S. on the deployment of anti-
missile shield in South America, North America and elsewhere. In
this regard, the U.S. may seek help from Canada. Have you ever
thought about what position Canada should take?
</P>
<P>
A: In our view, to establish the TMD does not conform with the
existing international treaties on missiles. It will not serve the
interests of world peace. On the contrary, it will only trigger
arms race. That is our comment. As to what view Canada should have
on this question, that would be your business. But China is firmly
opposed to the inclusion of China's Taiwan into this TMD because
that will mean encroachment upon China's sovereignty and also
constitute an interference in our internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Q: The U.S. Government is concerned about the missile launched
by the DPRK aimed at Japan. They are also concerned about the
missiles deployed by China against Taiwan. We would like to know
whether you would remove the missiles so that the U.S. would find
it unnecessary to deploy TMD. Are you ready to use your influence
with the DPRK to make the deployment of TMD unnecessary?
</P>
<P>
A: I said at my press conference on March 15 this year that the
United States has alleged that China had deployed about 600
missiles along its southeast coast. But I said that I had no
knowledge about that. I asked President Jiang about the matter
today, he said he had no knowledge about that either. So I do not
know where the Americans have got the information. Here I am not
saying that we have never deployed any missile on our own soil.
But this is something within our sovereignty. This is not a matter
that should arouse any attention. Why should they take so much
interest in it? Does it make any difference to deploy missiles
along the coast or in Xinjiang? By highlighting the coastal
deployment, they are simply trying to find a pretext for the
development of the TMD.
</P>
<P>
As to what was really launched into the sky by the DPRK, a
missile or a satellite, I really don't know. Some people said it
was a missile, while others said it was a satellite. And the
Americans did not make it clear either.
</P>
<P>
It is true that the DPRK has a traditional friendship with
China, but it is a sovereign state. We do not have much knowledge
about the military force in the DPRK. We hope to see continued
peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. We are doing our
utmost to this end. That is all we can possibly do.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the United States can do more. In fact, the United
States would not overestimate the military power of the DPRK. I
believe that the Americans know only too well what kind of
missiles the DPRK has and whether the DPRK has nuclear weapons at
all. It is our assumption that the DPRK does not pose a threat. It
should not serve as a pretext for the development of the TMD.  (

TUNIS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini arrived in Tripoli Tuesday morning, becoming the first
high-ranking Western official to fly into Libya after the U.N.

</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at Tripoli's international airport, Dini

Peace, development and cooperation in the Mediterranean region

Libya on Monday handed over two former intelligence agents
suspected of blowing up a Pan Am passenger plane ion 1988 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.

<HEADLINE> Profits at U.S. Large Manufacturers Fell in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Profits after taxes at large
manufacturers fell during the fourth quarter of 1998 to their
lowest level in three years, the New York Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After-tax profits at large manufacturers averaged 5.1 cents for
every dollar of sales in the fourth quarter of last year, compared
with 6.2 cents in the third quarter and 6 cents in the quarter a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
According to the Commerce Department's estimates, last year's
fourth- quarter average was the lowest since an average of 4.9
cents for the fourth quarter of 1995. Over all, manufacturers'
after-tax profits totaled 50.1 billion dollars during the fourth
quarter, compared with 60.6 billion in the third quarter and 59.3
billion dollars in the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Profits for individual industries, which are not adjusted for
seasonal variations, were mixed, the Commerce Department said.
Manufacturers reporting declines included fabricated metals,
stone, clay and glass, nonferrous metals, iron and steel, and
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
However, the Department said, retailers' profits rose in the
period. Retailers' after-tax profits totaled 9.3 billion dollars
during the fourth quarter, compared with 5.3 billion dollars in
the third quarter and 8.8 billion dollars in the quarter a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department's estimates were based on quarterly
financial reports from 493 retailers and 7,707 manufacturers.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier's Interview with Canadian Publisher (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: How do you think the U.S. should develop the TMD? How to get
the needed money to do that? Canada would also finance the
project. How will this affect China's policy towards Taiwan?
</P>
<P>
A: We don't know how the U.S. would develop the TMD. In fact, I
have got information from two different sources, one suggesting
that the TMD is not a practically applicable system at the moment,
and the other suggesting that the U.S. has already successfully
developed the TMD with a high degree of accuracy. I do not know
which one to believe. The two sources have only one thing in
common, that is, its cost is enormous. In any case, we oppose the
inclusion of Taiwan into the TMD. Should that happen, it would be
very dangerous.
</P>
<P>
Q: Why dangerous?
</P>
<P>
A: Didn't you get me? I said it will constitute an encroachment
upon Chinese sovereignty. Taiwan is part of China.
</P>
<P>
Q: Could you please tell me something about the WTO? China is
negotiating with the U.S. and Canada on its entry into the WTO.
What are the crux of the problem in the negotiations? What demands
that Canada and the U.S. have raised are unacceptable to China?
</P>
<P>
A: The WTO negotiations have been going on for 13 years. I
believe many issues should have been resolved by now. Recently, we
have had bilateral negotiations with the U.S. and Canada. I
believe we are coming very close to an agreement. In particular,
in our negotiations with Canada, Australia and Japan, which have
been proceeding more smoothly than those with the U.S., we hardly
have any disagreement concerning China's accession to the WTO. As
for our negotiations with the U.S., we still cannot reach
agreement mainly due to political reasons on the part of the U.S.,
by which I mean that the political atmosphere in the U.S. is not
favorable to having an agreement with China. The main problem is
with the U.S. side.
</P>
<P>
China and Canada maintain a good relationship in a wide range
of areas, including the political, economic and cultural fields.
Of course, we still have some different views or opinions on human
rights and on some other questions. However, it does not stand in
the way of advancement of friendship and cooperation between China
and Canada. So I have full confidence in the success of my
forthcoming visit to Canada. I believe that through full and
friendly discussions with Prime Minister Chretien and other
leaders of Canada, my trip will result in greater understanding
between the two countries and greater development of cooperation
in various fields between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Experts Warn Against High Suicide Rate of German </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN April 6 (Xinhua)--There is an "alarming high" suicide
rate of German youngsters aged between 12 to 17, a study in 36
German schools by the University of Bremen said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
About 30 among 1,035 interviewed teenagers had attempted to end
their lifes, and nearly ten per cent of the students had at least
think about suicide, experts reported.
</P>
<P>
At the same age, the German girls more often live under anxiety
and depression than boys, and they are more sensitive to the
change of social environment.
</P>
<P>
The study funded by German Research Association (DFG) also
showed that with the age growing, German teenagers are more likely
to try alcohol or other addictive substance.
</P>
<P>
More than one fifth of the youngsters aged between 16 to 17
drink alcohol at least once or twice a week, and nearly one third
of the age group have consumed hashish for at least five times,
the study said.

<P>
Q: We know that U.S. Secretary of Commerce Daley and the U.S.
Trade Representative have been here in China recently. And we have
seen some reports that the Chinese and the U.S. sides still have
some differences. China and the United States have not reached
agreement on certain issues, and it seems that no deal will be
made on the WTO. Is there anything the U.S. is asking but China
cannot give?
</P>
<P>
A: In my view, Secretary Daley might not know very clearly
about the negotiations. However, his trip to China this time still
accomplished the anticipated goal. The delegation he led,
including the business group, came to China mainly to discuss with
us projects of cooperation in the infrastructure development which
include the areas of energy and information. I believe the
discussions yielded rich results with a number of contracts signed.
About any possible disagreements now still left in the
negotiations between China and the U.S., they cannot be explained
clearly in a few words. Pending a final agreement, it would not be
appropriate for me to unilaterally disclose the details of the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Q: I wish you could.
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, I could. But should I disclose the details, I am afraid
that the American negotiator Barshefsky would be furious. That
would make it more difficult for us to carry on the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
But what I can say at this stage is that we have almost reached
an agreement on market access and agricultural products. The
Americans think that we have not opened our market wide enough,
such as the securities market and telecom market. But I think they
have not produced sufficient argument to make their case.
</P>
<P>
There are still some questions we need to negotiate concerning
the protocol of access. Generally speaking, I do not think that it
is economically very difficult for us to agree on the question of
WTO. It is a political decision for the U.S. to make to sign the
agreement when it deems the political conditions are ripe.

PARIS -- France said on Tuesday that NATO could launch in the
coming hours and Tuesday night its most violent airstrikes against
Yugoslav forces since the beginning of the operation on March 24.
</P>
<P>
During a press conference in the Defense Ministry on the
situation in Kosovo, the Assistant Chief of Operations of the
General Staff of the French Armed Forces, Xavier Delcourt, said
that massive airstrikes are expected in the coming hours because
of good weather conditions in the Balkans and the arrival of the U.
S. aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt in the Adriatic Sea.
</P>
<P>
He said that the air capacities of the Yugoslav forces "
practically don't exist any more" and that the remaining five Mig-
29 fighters of the Serb air force can no longer take off.
</P>
<P>
The commanding and control capacities of the Yugoslav forces
have also been greatly damaged by NATO, but the ground-to-air
defense force of Yugoslavia "remains rather strong locally" and "
makes up a threat which one cannot totally ignore," said the
French general. (France-NATO-Yugoslavia)

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier's Interview with Canadian Publisher (8) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: Could you say something about China's economic situation for
our readers? It seems to us that China's growth has slowed down
and some serious problems have emerged In the West, including
Canada, you are called a great economic reformer You have done
some ground-breaking reforms in economic structure. But now,
people feel that the reform pace has somewhat slowed down, for
example, in housing reform and other reforms. Could you say
something?
</P>
<P>
A: Last year China's growth rate was 7.8 percent, which was
fairly high indeed. The anticipated economic growth rate for China
this year is again a high one -- 7 percent. What counts is not the
mere speed, but better economic results.
</P>
<P>
It is my estimation that this year China's growth rate could be
higher than the projected 7 percent. And even if it turns out to
be less than 7 percent, it will still be a sound development speed.
</P>
<P>
The reform in China has not slowed down as some people outside
China have claimed. This is not true. On the contrary, last year
economic reforms in all areas moved ahead faster than planned.
</P>
<P>
Last year, we made unprecedented major accomplishments in the
reform of SOEs. In the past China's SOEs were not allowed to lay
off redundant staff. They did not perform satisfactorily as a
result of over-staffing. At the beginning of last year, 10 million
workers of SOEs were laid off. In other words, they were
unemployed, owing to the deepening of reform and the impact of the
financial crisis. But we have taken measures and established the
social security system to make sure that the 10 million laid-off
workers can have their basic needs met, and social instability has
thus been avoided. By the end of last year, only six million of
the laid-off workers had not found new jobs. Of course, the SOE
performances last year was somewhat worse than that of the year
before, but it was largely caused by the Asian financial crisis
which affected China's export and the catastrophic floods in China.
This year the SOEs are expected to have better economic returns
than last year. By the end of next year, most of the large and
medium-sized loss-making SOEs will become profit-making ones.
</P>
<P>
Q: You still think that, by the end of next year, the goals set
for these three years can be realized?
</P>
<P>
A: I have already declared that if I fail to achieve these
goals, I will step down. In other words, I have offered my
political life as a guarantee.

KUWAIT CITY, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Emir Jaber Al-Ahmed
Al-Sabah has decided on behalf of the royal family to donate 1
million U.S. dollars to the Kosovo refugees, a senior Kuwaiti
official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"With great concern over the compulsory relocation of the
Muslim Kosovars by the Serb forces, the emir decided to donate in
the name of Al-Sabah family 1 million dollars," Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs Abdel Aziz
Al-Dekheel said.
</P>
<P>
"This came as a manifestation of the emir's keenness on
contributing to efforts aimed at ending the hardships of the
Kosovo people," the minister was quoted by Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The emir had ordered Kuwaiti government to send urgent relief
to Kosovo refugees as the massive NATO air strikes against
Yugoslavia continue.
</P>
<P>
He also urged international community to intensify efforts to
bring an end to the refugee crisis in Kosovo, a southern province

</P>
<P>
Since the U.S.-led NATO forces began air raids against
Yugoslavia on March 24, hundreds of thousands of Kosovo refugees
have fled their homes to neighboring Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
NATO member states, however, were only committed to taking in
about 100,000 Kosovo refugees. The continuing NATO attack and
exodus of refugees are feared to lead to instability in the Balkan

<HEADLINE> Supachai to Visit Europe to Seek Crucial Votes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Prime Minister
Supachai Panitchpakdi will visit Europe Wednesday, to seek crucial
support for his bid to win the top post of the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Supachai, also commerce minister, will visit Germany, Portugal,
Greece and Belgium, a TV report said Tuesday. This will be
Supachai's second visit to the continent since he joined in the
race to become the WTO new chief.
</P>
<P>
He only returned from his latest European lobbying effort late
last week when he said he stood a good chance to win the race.
</P>
<P>
WTO members failed last week in Geneva to choose between
Supachai and his rival, New Zealand's Michael Moore, missing four
deadlines to select a new chief to replace Renato Ruggiero of
Italy, whose term expires on April 30.
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero insists he would step down on April 30, a move which
could trigger a leadership crisis if no successor is chosen.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said earlier that Thailand
was contacting countries which have backed Supachai to ensure
their continued support, but the United States had yet to respond
to his letter asking President Bill Clinton to consider Supachai
despite reports that Washington preferred Moore to Supachai.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said over the
weekend that Washington would be acting as "a close friend" if it
supported Supachai.
</P>
<P>
Supachai, with a strong support base in Asia, is running
closely with Moore in the race that has entered its final phase,
according to reports reaching here from Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Some European countries, like Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands
and France, are also leaning towards Supachai.
</P>
<P>
Moore has the support of Germany, Austria, Italy and Sweden and
crucially the United States.
</P>
<P>
But no nation is willing to admit publicly it would veto either
Moore or Supachai. Washington secretly vetoed against Supachai at
a WTO meeting last week, thus delaying the selection process,
according to press reports.
</P>
<P>
WTO members are to select a candidate by consensus. Only if
that cannot be established could a formal vote be held.
</P>
<P>
But diplomats and trade officials say they would prefer to
avoid such an outcome, arguing that the WTO director-general has
to be the "candidate of all the members" and not a figure whose
appointment is opposed by anyone.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Welcomes Handover of Libyan Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon Tuesday hailed the
handover of two Libyan suspects accused of bombing a U.S. airliner
over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Salim Hoss said at a news conference that he
welcomed the settlement reached between Libya and the United
Nations over the Lockerbie issue.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the handover would eventually lead to the
complete lifting of the U.N. sanctions against Libya.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan government Monday handed Lamen Khalifa Fhimah and
Abdel Basset over to U.N. representative Hans Corell for trial in
the Netherlands before a Scottish court.
</P>
<P>
In the same day, Alain Dejammet, current president of the
U.N. Security Council, announced that the U.N. sanctions, which
were imposed in 1992 after Libya refused to hand over the two
suspects, were suspended.
</P>
<P>
But, they cannot be formally lifted until U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan submits a report to the Security Council
within the next 90 days, saying that Libya has complied with
all relevant U.N. resolutions.

<HEADLINE> China Accelerates Development of Renewable Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- China is placing unprecedented
importance on developing renewable energy as evidenced by today's
launch of the largest-ever technological aid project funded by the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
The project, which focuses on accelerating the capacity in
building the commercialization of renewable energy in China,
involves total funding of 25.83 million US dollars. The UNDP
Global Environment Foundation (GEF) will provide funds totaling 8.
85 million US dollars, with an additional three million dollars
coming from the Australian Government, 2.53 million from the Dutch
government and 11.5 million from the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
The project is designed to establish a commercialization
mechanism to attract domestic and international investment needed
for developing and introducing renewable energy.
</P>
<P>
China ranks second in the world in terms of energy consumption,
following the United States. The nation's coal-burning energy
structure has created both local and international pollution
problems which have attracted worldwide attention. International
protocols require China to substantially reduce greenhouse gas
emissions by early in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 million Chinese currently live in areas without access
to electricity. Applications of renewable energy resources,
including wind, solar and methane, will provide reliable supplies
of power needed for daily-life activities and production.
</P>
<P>
China's rapid economic growth has led to a rapid decrease in
fossil fuel reserves such as oil. The Chinese government responded
by issuing the strategic "Outline for the development of renewable
energy between 1996-2000".
</P>
<P>
UNDP and World Bank studies show renewable energy resources,
excluding water resources, will supply some six percent of China's
power consumption by 2020.
</P>
<P>
The State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC) and State
Environmental Protection Bureau will carry out a related five-year
project, in addition to two renewable energy development projects
funded by the World Bank and the Asia Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
UNDP representative in China Kerstin Leitner said that the
project will be of "strategic importance" for China. She noted
that the success of the project will not only promote the
commercialization of renewable energy in China, but will also
provide practical experiences for other developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier's Interview with Canadian Publisher (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji had an
interview with Roger Parkinson, chairman and publisher of The
Globe and Mail of Canada on the evening of April 2.
</P>
<P>
The following is a full text of the interview.
</P>
<P>
Q: We understand that yesterday you had a discussion late into
night about whether you would go on the trip to the U.S. and
Canada or not. But now you seem to have decided that the trip will
be definitely on. Is that true or not?
</P>
<P>
A: You are quite right. It is true that due to the latest
developments, I did wonder whether I should make my visit as
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
As I said during my press conference on March 15, although
there was an anti-China current in the United States, I was still
ready to go, and to make some explanations about certain questions
and to tell the truth to the general public of the U.S. so as to
promote mutual understanding between the two peoples and to push
forward China-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
However, the recent developments have been moving very fast.
First, we have seen the use of force against Yugoslavia. Second,
the U.S. has decided to table a draft resolution against China at
the forthcoming session of the UN Human Rights Commission in
Geneva. And third, due to pressures from various sources in the
United States, the U.S. Government now appears rather reluctant to
have an agreement with us on China's entry into the WTO, although
there had been good hope of an agreement in the course of our
bilateral negotiations on the subject. Given all this, we were
asking ourselves what we could accomplish by going to the United
States against such a backdrop.
</P>
<P>
In spite of these difficulties, President Jiang Zemin and the
Chinese leadership have made the decision that I should make the
trip to the United States as scheduled. What we take into
consideration is the bigger picture of the overall relations
between China and the United States, and we hope that we can do
something in order to soften this anti-China current and to keep
up the growth of China-U.S. friendly relations and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
But for me, the forthcoming visit to the United States will be
no easy task. There are people in the United States who do not
welcome me to their country because I have made a voice different
from that of the United States. There are also some Chinese who
may not be very happy to see me visit the United States. Some
people have even expressed their opposition to my U.S. trip.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese media has already announced the date of my trip to
the United States and Canada. I told your ambassador that after a
few days of intensive work in the United States, I would like to
relax myself for a few days in Canada. Having said that, I know
that I may also encounter some demonstrators and protesters in
Canada. But I still think I will feel at home in your country.  (

let a tiny minority into their own countries," the statement
alleged.

SHANGHAI, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Shanghai and the
Shanghai Property Rights Exchange today introduced 10 favorable
regulations governing mergers and purchases of small- to medium-

<P>
Commissions for intermediary services will be reduced by 50
percent for foreign-funded companies and high-tech firms.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Q: Just now you said that one of your concerns is what is now
happening in the former Yugoslavia, in Serbia, and Kosovo for
example. So could you explain in details what is China's real
concern? For example, what makes you so concerned on the question
of Kosovo? Is it because the military actions are not authorized
by the United Nations or lack proper prior consultations? Or
because you think that what Milosevic has done is not that serious
and nothing should be done to him? What is the real concern of
China in this case?
</P>
<P>
A: On the Kosovo question, President Jiang Zemin made
statements on four different occasions during his European tour.
That was very rare indeed. His statements made very clear the
explicit position of the People's Republic of China on this
question. The statements also reflected the serious concern of the
Chinese people about this matter.
</P>
<P>
We demand an immediate end to all the military actions. These
military actions have already caused a heavy loss of lives and
property, bringing about serious consequences. We don't think that
military actions will solve any problem. They will only be a
painful and dangerous process. This has already been proved in
history.
</P>
<P>
We call for an immediate return to the track of political
negotiations, for political negotiations are the only way which
will lead to a solution to the Kosovo issue.

<P>
TEHRAN, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Supreme Court has rejected
an re-investigation appeal by former Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein
Karbaschi and returned the case to Tehran justice department, it
was announced here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Director General of the Public Relations Office of the Iranian
Judiciary Fotovat Nasiri Savadkouhi told the Islamic Republic News
Agency that the case is at the disposal of head of Tehran justice
department and he is responsible to determine when the ruling
should be executed.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi, a strong supporter of Iran's moderate President
Mohammad Khatami, was publicly tried on charges of graft in last
July and sentenced to five years in prison, a 20-year suspension
from holding government posts, 60 lashes of the whip and a fine of
one billion rials (about 333,000 U.S dollars).

An appeal court in December reduced the ruling to two years in
jail, banned him from executive office for 10 years and ordered
him to pay 1.6 billion rials in fines (about 533,000 dollars). But
Karbaschi's lawyers appealed for re-investigation of the case by
the supreme court.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi's lawyer Bahman Keshavarz told IRNA on Sunday that he
would apply other available means and mechanisms for renewed
investigation of the case if the mayor's appeal was turned down.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that the Supreme Court, as the highest judicial
body monitoring full enforcement of the law, should accept the
demand for formation of public courts.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here noted the rejection of Karbaschi's
appeal indicated the determination of the hardline conservatives
to elbow aside Khatami's supporters, particularly those who helped
Khatami to win the presidential elections in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Many political parties recently called for an immediate
determination on Karbaschi's fate in order to choose new mayor for
the Iranian capital because the mayor's post remained vacant since
Karbaschi was put on trial.

<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Muhammed Hosni
Mubarak visited Beijing University (BU) earlier today and noted
that his countrymen are extremely proud of their generations of
friendship with Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak made the remark in an afternoon speech delivered at BU,
one of China's most prestigious universities. The university also
presented Mubarak with an honorary doctorate degree.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president cited the honorary degree as an
indication of the "brotherly friendship" between Chinese and
Egyptian people.
</P>
<P>
He told over 500 teachers and students in attendance that Egypt
and China have similar histories dating back thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian and Chinese civilizations originated in respective
areas along the Nile and Yangtze River more than seven thousand
years ago and have since influenced neighboring areas both
culturally and technologically for thousands of years, said
Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and China differ from the other nations in the fact that
they have enjoyed long-term peace and unity, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The noted statesman said that scientific and technological
achievements should not be monopolized by a singly group of
countries, but should instead belong to mankind.
</P>
<P>
The international community should provide necessary assistance
to developing countries to ensure that scientific and
technological achievements are used for social development, said
Mubarak.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, Qatar Call for Peaceful Settlement of Int'l Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and Qatar Tuesday
agreed that establishment of peace and security in the region
required non-use of force and peaceful settlement of disputes.
</P>
<P>
This was contained in a joint communique issued by the two
Muslim countries at the end of a two-day visit by Amir of Qatar
Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani.
</P>
<P>
According to the joint communique, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
briefed the Amir on the resumed Pakistan-India dialogue and
efforts made by Pakistan for the resolution of all outstanding
issues between the two countries including the Jammu and Kashmir
dispute.
</P>
<P>
The Amir welcomed the Lahore Declaration signed by Sharif and
his Indian counterpart Atal Bihari Vajpayee during the latter's
visit to Pakistan in February.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope for early realization of the commitments made
by Pakistan and India towards settlement of all outstanding issues
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and Qatar also noted that progress and prosperity of
the region required a stable and peaceful environment in South
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Both sides reaffirmed their full support for earlier
restoration of peace in Afghanistan on the basis of the
preservation of its independence, sovereignty and territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
Towards this end, they reiterated their resolve to supplement
all efforts, especially under the auspices of the United Nations
and the Organization of Islamic Conference, and welcomed the
progress of intro-Afghan peace talks recently held in Ashkabat,
capital of Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
The two countries Tuesday signed four agreements on promotion
and protection of investment, avoidance of double taxation.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Sheikh Hamad and Sharif encompassed matters
relating to bilateral cooperation in various fields and a review
of the regional situation, with particular reference to South Asia
and the Middle East, and the international developments at large.
</P>
<P>
The joint communique said that exchange of views between the
two leaders took place in an atmosphere of complete understanding,
characterized by mutual confidence and commonality of views that
so closely exists between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
While reviewing the bilateral relations, the two leaders
reiterated their resolve to intensify economic and technical
cooperation commensurate with the level and quality of their
political relations.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to reinforce the Joint Ministerial Commission as an
umbrella for carrying forward the agenda for economic cooperation,
especially promotion of trade and investments.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed the hope that the establishment of a Joint
Business Committee will bring the private sector of the two
countries closer and tap the potential for new forms of
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the paramount significance of the Islamic solidarity
on the eve of the new millennium, the two leaders underlined the
importance of concerted action amongst the members of Ummah
(Muslim world) in meeting challenges that confront them and in
dealing with issues of peace and progress in the international
arena.
</P>
<P>
They reiterated their determination to strengthen the
deliberative fora to the Ummah, specially the Organization of
Islamic Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
The two leaders, while reviewing the Middle East situation,
reiterated their shared view that path to peace in the region lies
through faithful implementation of all agreements and in the
Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab lands including Golan
Heights, South Lebanon and the occupied Palestinian territory.
</P>
<P>
They also reaffirmed their support for the Palestinian right to
establish the Palestinian State with Jerusalem as its capital.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier on Reducing Air Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Air and environmental pollution
has become one of the major factors hindering the country's
economic and social development and affecting people's health,
said Vice-Premier Li Lanqing in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a working conference on promoting the use of clean
fuel and reducing urban air pollution, Li, also a member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee, said that sulfur dioxide and
dust produced from coal burning and the tail gas emission of
automobiles are the major causes for air pollution.
</P>
<P>
Clean and low-pollution fuel should be developed and be
upgraded to reduce auto emissions, Li told the conference, which
focused on the "Clean Fuel Project" as a measure to reduce air
pollution.
</P>
<P>
He said that effective measures should be taken and improvement
be made in the first group of pilot cities and in Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to the control of coal burning and tail gas
emissions, other causes for the air pollution should also be taken
care of," Li noted. He said that construction sites should be
better managed and urban greenery be increased to reduce dust
pollution.
</P>
<P>
"Those enterprises which produce heavy pollution and cannot
meet the national standard of pollutant discharges should be shut
down or punished by other methods," he said, adding that
national awareness of environmental protection should also be
enhanced.
</P>
<P>
Li said the clean fuel project should focus on the development
of clean and high-efficiency fuel, while improving relevant
policies, technology, laws, standards, investment and management.
</P>
<P>
The conference approved the decision that the clean fuel
project will first be formally promoted in 12 cities and areas
which include Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Harbin, Changchun, Xi'an,
Urumqi, Shenzhen, Guangzhou cities and Chuanzhong Area in Sichuan
Province, and Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
The conference was jointly sponsored by the Ministry of Science
and Technology, the State Development Planning Commission, the
State Environmental Protection Administration and other government
organizations.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Government Regrets E. Timorese Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government Tuesday
expressed regret over pro-independence East Timorese leader Xanana
Gusmao's call on his people to resume their war against Indonesian
forces.
</P>
<P>
"What we need now is a situation conducive to the holding of
the United Nations-sponsored direct balloting on the autonomy
package this July," Indonesian President B.J. Habibie's top aide
Dewi Fortuna Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was commenting on the call Gusmao made from his special
prison on Monday for the East Timorese to resume their fight
against Indonesian troops who have allegedly been arming
pro-integration groups.
</P>
<P>
She said the East Timorese need to be free from fear and all
conflicting parties in the troubled province should restrain
themselves and stop blaming one another.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that at least two pro-integrationist East
Timorese were stabbed to death by armed anti-integrationist groups
in a fresh outbreak of clashes in Liquica district over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said that the presence of the Indonesian Armed Forces in
East Timor is only aimed at keeping the situation peaceful and
secure.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Gusmao's call for the presence of U.N. peacekeeping
forces in the former Portuguese colony, she said there is no need
for an "outside party" in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gusmao's lawyer Johnson Panjaitan told reporters
here Tuesday that Gusmao will revoke his call to arms only if the
U.N. steps in to stop the Indonesian military from launching
attacks against the people in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with a population of some 800,000 and an area of
15,000 square kilometers, had been a Portuguese colony until 1975.
It became an Indonesian province in 1976, but the U.N. never
recognized the move.
</P>
<P>
On January 27, the Indonesian government announced that it is
ready to release East Timor if the alternative to provide wider
autonomy is refused by the people in the region and the
international community.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has suggested that the U.N.-sponsored
direct balloting to determine if the East Timor wants autonomy or
independence should be held in July.

<HEADLINE> Assassins of Iraqi Top Shiite Cleric Executed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi general security directorate
announced on Tuesday that four assassins of Iraq's most senior
Shiite cleric Mohammed Sadiq al-Sader were executed by hanging on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a communique carried by the Iraqi News Agency, the official,
whose name was not given in the report, said that the death
sentence was made by a special court.
</P>
<P>
The official announced on March 17 that Iraqi security
authorities had arrested four suspected assassins of Sader.
Another suspect was still at large, he added.
</P>
<P>
In a program aired on Iraq's national television on March 17,
one of the alleged assassins, Sheikh Abdul Hassan Abbas al-Kufi
was shown to confess that he had disputes with al-Sader on moral
and religious issues and this made him get involved in the
assassination of al-Sader.
</P>
<P>
Another accused, Ahmed Mustafa Hassan al-Ardabily, said on the
screen that he worked for the Supreme Council of the Islamic
Revolution in Tehran, Iran from 1991 until 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi general security directorate has accused a "foreign
country" of being behind the assassination of Sader.
</P>
<P>
Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Sadiq al-Sader and two of his sons
were assassinated on February 19 in Iraq's southern province of
Najaf, not long after he made remarks against the Saddam regime.
</P>
<P>
The assassination was reported by foreign media and exiled Iraqi
dissident groups to have led to unrest in Iraq. Some exiled Iraqi
groups had accused the Iraqi government of masterminding the murder.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government appointed Sader as Grand Ayatollah in 1992
to replace the late Grand Ayatollah Abul Qassim al-Khoei.
</P>
<P>
Sader enjoyed high respect among Shiites who comprise about 55
percent of Iraq's 22 million people. President Saddam Hussein and
most of Iraq's senior officials belong to the minority Sunni
group.

DHAKA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Peace Council has
condemned the "barbaric" airstrike of the North Atlantic
Organization (NATO) on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The council demanded immediate cessation of all military
actions to pave way for a negotiated settlement of the Kosovo
issue, The Independent daily newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
By its act of armed intervention, the NATO has trampled upon
the independence, sovereignty and right of self-determination of
the Yugoslav people, the council's General Secretary Ali Aksad
said in a statement issued Monday.
</P>
<P>
The NATO has violated the U.N. Charter and undermined the world
public opinion for peace and justice, added Aksad, who is also the
Asian regional coordinator of the World Peace Council.

<HEADLINE> China Positive on Turkey's Bid for Position in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- China has a positive attitude
towards Turkey's bid to become a non-permanent member of the
United Nations' Security Council, visiting Chinese leader Li Peng
said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It would benefit the work of the Security Council if Turkey
becomes a non-permanent member, because with its strategically
important location, Turkey was able to have its influence in this
region, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress of China, made the statement when answering
questions from Turkish journalists at a press conference held
before winding up his five-day visit to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
On the prospects of the world in the upcoming 21st century, he
said there would exist challenges as well as opportunities in the
new century, while peace and development would continue to be the
main subjects of the world.
</P>
<P>
However, the top Chinese legislator noted, with an apparent
reference to the air strikes against Yugoslavia by the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), that world peace was now
being threatened.
</P>
<P>
China, like many other countries, would like to see a
multi-polar world rather than a unipolar one, because the former
is a safer place than the latter, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that although the trend of globalization of
the world economy brings opportunities of development to the
developing nations, it also comes along with risks. Therefore, the
developing countries must learn to protect themselves in the
process of economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
China, the largest developing nation in the world, still has a
long way to go in its modernization drive. It would take, maybe,
another 30 to 50 years before China reaches the goal of
modernization, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Only with peace as a precondition can China keep developing
economically, he stressed, reiterating China's position against
hegemonism and power politics in the world affairs.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng arrived in Istanbul, the largest city of the country,
last Friday. He came here on Sunday and would conclude the visit
to Turkey and leave for Damascus, Syria, later on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> City Heritage Sites Under Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The development and modernization
of China's heritage sites should only go ahead taking into account
cultural and preservation requirements, according to city
landscaping experts.
</P>
<P>
Their plea came after local authorities in Xingcheng, northeast
Liaoning Province, sold off traditional ancient roadside houses
and buildings in the area's most prosperous street.
</P>
<P>
Then, say the experts, a number of individuals who had bought
the houses had them altered to attract modern tourists who think
of this coastal city Xingcheng as a quiet summer resort.
</P>
<P>
The old road is also now disfigured by brash advertisements for
famous brands of goods which affects the harmony and traditional
feel of the city, which was listed as a treasured traditional site
by the state in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Ranking with Pingyao, Shanxi Province, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province,
and Xiangfan, Hubei Province, the northeastern city was regarded
as one of the most well-preserved ancient city centers, which
originally thrived in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).
</P>
<P>
However, with the market economy in full swing, city management
and local entrepreneurs are keen to make every effort to attract
as many tourists as possible.
</P>
<P>
They face the dilemma of whether to modernize the city to make
more money or maintain its traditional facades and appearance to
protect its heritage and history.
</P>
<P>
Now, the authorities have now decided that before they begin
any new development projects they will take advice about
landscaping and rebuilding recommendations from experts and
scholars.
</P>
<P>
City mayor Zhang Jingqiang has insisted that the city will try
not to sacrifice any more of its treasured cultural heritage in
favor of money-spinning industries.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Appeal Davis Cup Venue Change-Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Tennis Australia is to appeal to
the International Tennis Federation (ITF) over its loss of home
advantage for Australia's Davis Cup quarter-final with the United
States in July.
</P>
<P>
Australia would host the tie as the last game between the two
nations was in the US in 1997, but the ITF decided to celebrate
the centenary of the Davis Cup by ensuring a US tie would be
played in Boston, the city where the Cup was born.
</P>
<P>
TA president Geoff Pollard said he believe Australia can stage
a better celebration in Melbourne Park--the world's best tennis
venue--than a match in an aging stadium in Boston.
</P>
<P>
Davis Cup office spokeswoman Debbie Bamlett said the ITF's
board of directors would consider an appeal if it was lodged, but
added "preparations are already well in hand in Boston".

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebel Group May Release Hostage Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine National Police
(PNP) said Tuesday that the National Democratic Front (NDF) could
release an abducted chief inspector Roberto Bernal in the next 72
hours.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with reporters here Tuesday, PNP Chief Deputy
Director General Roberto Lastimoso said, "Things are really
moving" regarding the possible release of Roberto Bernal, one of
the five uniformed officers abducted by the NDF's armed wing --
New People's Army since last year.
</P>
<P>
"We are expecting the release very soon. We're talking about 72
hours at the maximum," Lastimoso said when asked about the time
frame of the release.
</P>
<P>
Bernal is the only police officer among the five hostages. The
rebel group agreed to release the hostages between March 22 and
April 19 following talks with a humanitarian group led by Davao
Archbishop Fernando Capalla in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Also in captivity are Brig. Gen. Victor Obillo, Capt. Eduardo
Montealto, an unnamed military intelligence officer, and Sgt.
Alipio Lozada.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate the release of the hostages, President Joseph
Estrada suspended military operations against the rebel group from
March 28 to April 19 in areas where the hostages are expected to
be released.
</P>
<P>
But the president warned that government troops will resume
military operations if the rebels fail to release the hostages
after April 19.

<HEADLINE> Used Car Imports Threaten Philippines' Auto Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Uncontrolled inflows of used cars
and semi-knockdown (SKD) units into the Philippines are
threatening the long term survival of the local automotive
industry in the country.
</P>
<P>
Expectedly, it is seen to take its toll on the country's
thousands of workers who heavily depend upon the automotive
industry for their livelihood, Florencio Jurado, senior vice
president of Toyota Motors Philippines, said in a media interview
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He added that the imports also have adverse effects on the
revenues that the national government is supposed to collect from
their operations, he added.
</P>
<P>
If this continues unabated, it is likely that many car
companies of the country will cease operations because of unfair
competition that is currently taking place in the country, Jurado
said.
</P>
<P>
"What concerns us is that it disturbs the on-going trust to
revive the industry. We have been hit very hard as far as the
automotive industry is concerned," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the financial crisis, the Philippines, Thailand,
Malaysia and Indonesia sold a combined total of 1.5 million units
in 1996. But after the crisis, sales went down to 1.3 million in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Jurado continued that this even slid down further to about
500,000 units in 1998, barely a few months after the regional
currency turmoil hurt most Southeast Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
He believes that sales will improve in the second quarter of
1999 based on the study made by the University of Asia and the
Pacific that a one percent growth in the GNP can have an eight
percent improvement in car sales.
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed fears that despite the reduction in
interest rates, the financing sector is still reluctant to grant
vehicle loans. Naturally, the impact of this to the industry is
low sales considering that consumers rely so much on financing
rather than partake of their hard-earned cash to buy a car.
</P>
<P>
Because of this, the automotive industry and the parts
suppliers are one in opposing the government policy to allow the
entry of SKD and second-hand units into the local market.
</P>
<P>
Their opposition could only ease down once the motor vehicle
inspection program is fully put in place, Jurado stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that allowing the entry of used vehicles is
likely to endanger the environment because some of these units
were proven to emitting pollutants that are harmful to people's
health.

<HEADLINE> Trial Dhaka-Calcutta Bus Run Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- A Bangladeshi bus left here Tuesday
morning for Calcutta, India, marking the start of the trial run of
the bus service between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
A 30-member Bangladeshi delegation, comprising representatives
from the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority, the Bangladesh Road
Transport Corporation (BRTC) and the Customs and Immigration,
members of the law-enforcing agency and journalists are on the
bus, owned by the official BRTC.
</P>
<P>
The bus service, delayed several times, was taking place
following the signing of a two-year agreement in India in February
this year by officials of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Two buses would ply from each side for six days a week during
the initial period of commercial operation, which would begin
sometime later this month, and after three months of commercial
operation, the number of buses on the route would be determined by
the market demand.
</P>
<P>
Karar Mahmudul Hasan, joint secretary of the Ministry of
Communications, said Monday that the direct bus service was a
"good thing" for the common people.
</P>
<P>
About 500,000 Bangladeshi nationals visit India each year, and
the direct bus service would greatly reduce the hassle of the
passengers who had to undergo in the past, he said.
</P>
<P>
The service would facilitate movement of people and provide an
opportunity for greater interaction between the two peoples, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that opening other routes of direct bus service would
be considered on the response from the passengers of the
Dhaka-Calcutta route.
</P>
<P>
"We won't accept less than 60 percent of the total number of
buses that will ply because there are more people from our side to
travel," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi delegation is expected to meet their Indian
counterparts in Calcutta Wednesday to deal with issues concerning
the service along the 360-kilometer-long route, three-fourth of
which is within Bangladesh, before returning home Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A similar delegation from India will begin their journey for
Bangladesh Thursday along with the bus from Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Navy Frogmen Retrieve 1,000 Priceless Artifacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Navy divers have
retrieved from a sunken vessel in the Sulu Sea more than 1,000
pieces of priceless artifacts dating as far back as the 14th
century with British and Dutch markings.
</P>
<P>
Commander Benjamin Tancio, Navy spokesman, confirmed the
discovery, saying the artifacts are composed of centuries-old
porcelains, plates, cups, jars and water basins.
</P>
<P>
The discovery was made last December but it was only now that
the Navy knew about the priceless artifacts during an interview
with Tancio who recently assumed as the Navy's new public
information officer.
</P>
<P>
Tancio said the discovery of the artifacts was by accident when
a Navy patrol craft observed last December Muslim Tausog divers
busy retrieving porcelains from the Sulu Sea.
</P>
<P>
Since artifacts are considered national treasures, Navy chief
Vice Admiral Eduardo Ma. R. Santos ordered to secure the area. At
the same time, the National Museum was immediately informed about
the discovery.
</P>
<P>
Navy frogmen were sent to Sulu Sea where they retrieved more
than 1,000 pieces of 14th and 15th centuries porcelains and other
artifacts buried under a sunken British ship.
</P>
<P>
The priceless artifacts were brought to Manila under the
supervision of National Museum officials, Tancio said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that such a big number of centuries-old
artifacts were hauled by Navy divers from the vast Sulu Sea.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Govt. Troops Will Defeat UNITA: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Angolan presidential spokesman
Aldemiro Vaz da Conceicao said the government troops "will obtain
the capability to reverse the unfavorable military situation" now
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The official Journal of Angola newspaper Tuesday quoted the
spokesman as saying Monday that neither the Angolan government or
the international community foresaw "such big-scale war" which had
occurred in the country.
</P>
<P>
Da Conceicao noted that in the new budget, top priority was
given to defense. But he did not disclosed the exact number.
</P>
<P>
However, informed sources here said that defense accounted for
some 38 percent of the total budget.
</P>
<P>
Da Conceicao pointed out that the troops of the rebel National
Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) have become a
well-equipped strong "regular force," posing great threat to the
Angolan government army in central provinces of Bie and Huambo and
northern Malanje Province.
</P>
<P>
UNITA troops last week occupied Pung Andongo in Malanje
province, destroyed two T-55 government tanks and three trucks, a
Portuguese diplomat here revealed. the Portuguese Lusa agency
quoted UNITA sources as claiming to have killed a large number of
government soldiers in Bengo and Bie provinces in late March.
</P>
<P>
But these were not confirmed by the government.
</P>
<P>
The presidential spokesman revealed that with the illegal
incomes of selling the diamonds exploited in northeast Angola,
UNITA had bought from some east European countries such advanced
weapons as T-55 and T-62 tanks; GS/155, B-12, D-30 and D-130
medium- and long-range artillery and BMP-1 and BMP-2 armored
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Angolan government has made active diplomatic
efforts to seek state-of-art weaponry and to strengthen the
sanctions against the UNITA.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that during his trip to Moscow in early March,
Angolan Foreign Minister Joao Miranda won promise of economic and
military assistance from Russia and Angola would spend over one
billion U.S. dollars in purchasing arms from Moscow.

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Partnership with ASEAN (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Yang
Wenchang pointed out here today the further reinforcement of good-
neighborly and mutually trustworthy partnership between China and
ASEAN constitutes a key factor in the regional peace, stability
and development.
</P>
<P>
Yang, heading a Chinese delegation, has attended the fifth
China-ASEAN Senior Official Consultations, which closed here today.
Delegates from China, the ASEAN Secretariat and all the nine ASEAN
member countries agreed that the further strengthening of such
partnership is in the basic and long-term interests of both sides.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang, relationship between China and ASEAN has
witnessed rapid growth in recent years, which the Chinese side is
quite satisfied with.
</P>
<P>
China grew from a consultation dialogue country into a full-
dialogue partner of the organization within three years, and at
the end of 1997, it established good-neighborly and mutually
trustworthy partnership with ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement issued at the first informal China-ASEAN
leadership summit in 1997 has built up a framework for the
development of their relationship in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Yang noted that China's cooperation with ASEAN in the economic,
trade, scientific, technological, and other sectors has been
increasing, and they have coordinated and supported each other on
both regional and international issues.

<HEADLINE> Most Violent NATO Strikes in Coming Hours: France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- France said on Tuesday that NATO
could launch in the coming hours and Tuesday night its most
violent airstrikes against Yugoslav forces since the beginning of
the operation on March 24.
</P>
<P>
During a press conference in the Defense Ministry on the
situation in Kosovo, the Assistant Chief of Operations of the
General Staff of the French Armed Forces, Xavier Delcourt, said
that massive airstrikes are expected in the coming hours because
of good weather conditions in the Balkans and the arrival of the U.
S. aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt in the Adriatic Sea.
</P>
<P>
He said that the air capacities of the Yugoslav forces "
practically don't exist any more" and that the remaining five Mig-
29 fighters of the Serb air force can no longer take off.
</P>
<P>
The commanding and control capacities of the Yugoslav forces
have also been greatly damaged by NATO, but the ground-to-air
defense force of Yugoslavia "remains rather strong locally" and "
makes up a threat which one cannot totally ignore," said the
French general.
</P>
<P>
Delcourt also announced that French and British troops
stationed in Macedonia will establish a refugee camp a few
kilometers away from the Yugoslav border in the coming days to
shelter up to 60,000 Kosovo Albanians who have fled home.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 12,000 French, British and other NATO soldiers
deployed in Macedonia will be capable of coordinating the work of
the humanitarian organizations and the United Nations High
Commission for Refugees in establishing this refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
France has refused to provide temporary asylum for Kosovo
refugees as some other Western countries are doing. Paris prefers
to help the refugees on the scene rather than evacuating them.
</P>
<P>
The government stand has been criticized by some humanitarian
groups, newspapers and politicians in France.
</P>
<P>
France has been sending 260 tons of food and other humanitarian
materials to the refugees by military planes since early this
month, said French officials.

<TEXT>
<P>
Such cooperation has deepened mutual understanding and trust
among regional member countries, and played an active role in
safeguarding regional peace and stability as well as in
establishing a new world political and economic order.
</P>
<P>
China and the ASEAN member countries are all developing
countries and good neighbors, and there is broad potential for
their further cooperation, Yang said, adding it is an important
part of China's foreign policy to continue to develop good-
neighborly relations with the ASEAN member countries and other
surrounding countries.
</P>
<P>
He believes that the common interests between China and ASEAN
greatly exceed their divergence. One problem is that the present
cooperation is incompatible with their cooperative potential. Yang
said China will try to fully tap cooperative potential with all
the ASEAN countries in all sectors.
</P>
<P>
The second problem is that China has some historical left-over
issues such as territorial disputes with certain countries. In
this regard, Yang said the Chinese side will continue its dialogue
and negotiation with countries concerned, and try to properly
solve the question through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
He released that at the current consultation, China and ASEAN
both agreed to cherish the consensus that has been reached, and to
implement relevant commitments.

<HEADLINE> Punjab Governor Denies Report of Killing of Top Terrorist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Governor of Punjab Shahid Hamid
denied Tuesday the reported death of Riaz Basra, the most wanted
terrorist in Pakistan, in police encounter at Sargodha near Lahore
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Talking to the media after a function at a local college, Hamid
said that a hardened criminal named Shahzad, a notorious ring
leader of Lashker-e-Jhangvi, an extremist Sunni group, was shot
dead in the encounter, but not Riaz Basra.
</P>
<P>
He said that forensic test conducted to ascertain the identity
of the body, the birth mark and fingerprints revealed that he was
not Riaz Basra.
</P>
<P>
"The government is bound to catch the terrorists, and none will
be spared", he added. Society will be purged of such criminal
elements as the government will continue to give them a tough time
till they are flushed out.
</P>
<P>
The governor disclosed that 59 terrorists implicated in heinous
crimes and subversive activities had to date been detained.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said Monday that Riaz Basra, a religious
extremist-turned terrorist, was killed along with another
accomplice during the armed encounter.
</P>
<P>
With a head money of five million rupees (110,000 U.S.
dollars), Basra was wanted in 119 murder cases and 45 other cases
of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Basra, in his early thirties, was also wanted in the murder of
Sadiq Ganji, director general of the Iranian Consulate in Lahore
in 1991. He was accused most recently of attempting the life on
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in a bomb blast on a bridge near
Lahore early this year.
</P>
<P>
Three people were killed and four others injured in the blast
at the bridge where Prime Minister Sharif was about to pass five
minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Riaz Basra started his career in terrorism from Sipah-e-Sihaba
Pakistan (SSP), a political cum religious party which soon
distanced itself from Basra's activities.
</P>
<P>
Basra then spearheaded a new group called Lashkar-e-Jhangvi,
formed to avenge the assassination of SSP chief Nawaz Jhangvi.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested by police in 1992 and then escaped from the
police custody and went underground. Police had since then
attempted a lot of times to arrest Basra.

<HEADLINE> SMEs Playing Key Role in China's Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The development of small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will largely decide China's
economic performance this year and is also critical for the
sustainable economic growth in coming years, according to noted
economist Wu Jinglian.
</P>
<P>
He called on the government to pay great attention to SMEs and
create an environment in which they will develop smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Wu's aspirations are echoed by government officials. Wei Dong,
director of the SME Department of the State Economic and Trade
Commission, said that SMEs have served as a major driving force
for the growth of the national economy and provided most of the
employment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 10 million SMEs, accounting for 90 percent
of the total registered enterprises, and they generate some 60
percent of the country's gross industrial output value and 40
percent of the profits and taxes revenues.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990s, 76.7 percent of the newly added industrial output
value has been materialized by SMEs. In some sectors such as
garment and plastic product making, the output value realized by
SMEs have made up over 80 percent of the total, and the figure
hits more than 90 percent in the timber and furniture sectors.
</P>
<P>
Wei said that SMEs have been pioneers in China's economic
reform, and many of their experiences such as enterprise contracts,
bankruptcy and reorganization were gained from trials in SMEs. (

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
weaker on lower gold and commodity prices to be almost half a U.S.
cent lower at the close Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On the first day back from the four day Easter Break the local
currency had to fight to hold the 63 U.S. cents level, dipping
into the 62.90 U.S. cents region a number of times.
</P>
<P>
St George Bank manager of foreign exchange trading Stuart Moore
said trading in the Australian dollar was relatively quiet on the
day.
</P>
<P>
At the close the Australian dollar was trading at 63.09 U.S.
cents, from 63.58 U.S. cents before the long weekend.
</P>
<P>
The combined weight of a lower gold price, on the back of
renewed speculation over potential central bank selling, and
weakness in the Commodity Research Bureau (CRB) Index hampered the
Australian dollar's efforts on the day.
</P>
<P>
In New York, COMEX gold for current delivery closed at 278.30
U.S. dollars per ounce, down 1.60 U.S. dollars from Thursday's
COMEX close.
</P>
<P>
At the close the Australian dollar was buying 0.5883 euro from
0.5908 euro at Thursday's close and 76.39 Japanese yen from 75.50
yen.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the euro was trading at 1.0725 U.S. dollars from
1.0764 U.S. dollars and 129.83 Japanese yen from 127.91 yen.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Welcomes World Bank's $75 Million Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda has welcomed the World
Bank's approval of a 75-million-U.S. dollar loan as a positive
sign of the recovered trust by the donor community that Rwanda
will not use the money for its military efforts in the war in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Since the outbreak of the war last August, donors have grown
reluctant to disburse pledged financial assistance to Rwanda for
fear it might be diverted to funding the war in DRC, the Rwanda
News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We highly appreciated the approval, it is something we have
been waiting for, and which we followed closely," a senior Rwandan
government official said.
</P>
<P>
For Prosper Musafiri, director of macro-economics department in
the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, Rwanda was relieved
to see the loan granted.
</P>
<P>
He said the amount granted by the World Bank on March 24, will
mainly support Rwanda's economic reform program, in notably
bridging up the budget deficit estimated at about 287 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The loan is expected to consolidate recovery, reduce rural
poverty, and lay foundation for private sector-led growth, and
enhance national reconciliation by opening up economic
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the International Monetary Fund has also
disbursed to Rwanda 11 million U.S. dollars, as the second
installment of about 100 million U.S. dollars pledged in the
framework of the three year enhanced structural adjustment
program. The first installment amounted to about 16.7 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Despite Rwanda's assurances that it will not use aid to buy
weapons to fight the war in Congo, donors had held tight their
purses, requesting that a peace deal be brokered in the
eight-month-old conflict.

<TEXT>
<P>
Meanwhile, SMEs provide 75 percent of jobs for urban residents
and have been responsible for creating most jobs for the 230
million rural surplus farmers since reform and opening up. In 1997,
private SMEs employed 40 million laid-off workers from state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
But Wu warned that the government should not put too much focus
on the SMEs' function as employers, but instead should encourage
the raising of their efficiency, maintain their vitality and
sharpen their competitive edges.
</P>
<P>
The government should take concrete measures to facilitate
SMEs' access to financing and set up credit institutions to help
them avoid risks, Wu noted.
</P>
<P>
SMEs are more vulnerable to exorbitant taxes and levies, Wu
said, and he urged the government to reform the administrative
departments to get rid of the malpractice.
</P>
<P>
With China's economic reform deepening, the ownership structure
of SMEs has undergone great changes. Private enterprises account
for 77.7 percent of small enterprises, public-owned enterprises
take up 20.1 percent while state-owned enterprises are down to 1.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
Although the new Chinese Constitution has enshrined private
enterprises as an important component of the national economy,"
discrimination against them still lingers, the affect of which
must not be underestimated," Wu said.

<HEADLINE> Scottish Parliament Election Campaign Kicks Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Scottish National Party (SNP)
and the Scottish Liberal Democrats (SLD) kicked off their campaign
launches on Tuesday to fight for seats in the first Scottish
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Other parties will follow within days, one month before voters
go to the polls. But no party was expected to win an overall
majority when the Parliament sits in Edinburgh.
</P>
<P>
SNP leader Alex Salmond will unveil the nationalists' 10
pledges -- twice the number the Labor Party made at the general
election.
</P>
<P>
The move comes after opinion polls at the weekend suggested
Labor has increased its lead in the polls, with just over a month
to go before the vote.
</P>
<P>
Most of the SNP promises will be familiar to those who have
followed the contest for control of the Scottish Parliament, which
this week begins in earnest.
</P>
<P>
The key pledge is the party's decision to keep the basic rate
of income tax at 23 percent when Chancellor Gordon Brown cuts it
by 1 percent for the United Kingdom next year.
</P>
<P>
Dubbing this "Scotland's penny," the SNP promises it would
spend the extra cash on education and health, if it holds power
after the May 6 election.
</P>
<P>
Other pledges will include ending tuition fees for Scottish
students, plus 500 pounds (820 U.S. dollars) grants for the 20,000
poorest students, bringing water authorities back under government
control and replacing the Private Finance Initiative with public
service trusts.
</P>
<P>
A referendum on independence for Scotland will also be promised
to SNP voters.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Poor's Income Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The per capita income and
expenditure of the poor community in Bangladesh have increased
remarkably following the intervention of the government and
non-governmental organizations in a poverty-alleviation drive
across the country.
</P>
<P>
The monthly per-household income of the urban poor rose to
3,423 taka (about 70.6 U.S. dollars) in April 1998 from 2,847 taka
(about 58.7 dollars) in April 1997, while the average monthly
household income of rural poor increased to 2,302.2 taka (about
47.4 dollars) from 2,148 taka (about 44.3 dollars) during the same
period, according to a report submitted on Tuesday at a national
seminar on poverty monitoring.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was jointly organized by the Center on Integrated
Rural Development for Asia and the Pacific, and Bangladesh Bureau
of Statistics, and was attended by policy makers, academicians,
researchers, government officials, diplomats, representatives of
the donor community, international organizations, and other
organizations.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the per-capita monthly income of urban
poor increased to 637 taka (about 13.1 dollars) in April 1998 from
539 taka (about 11.1 dollars) a year earlier, and the average
per-capita monthly income of rural poor increased to 436.2 taka
(about 9.0 dollars) from 402.5 taka (about 8.3 dollars) during the
same period.
</P>
<P>
The daily per capita calorie intake of urban poor increased to
1958.8 kilo-calorie in April 1998 from 1925 kilo-calorie in April
1997, while daily per capita calorie intake of rural poor
increased to 1953.3 kilo-calorie from 1918 kilo-calorie during the
same period.
</P>
<P>
However, the other parameters of poverty alleviation like
ownership and access to resources, occupational status, literacy
level, health and sanitation, and gender equities, showed negative
improvement during the corresponding period, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Latest official figures show that 49.7 percent of Bangladesh's
urban residents live in poverty, and 47.1 percent of the rural
population are poor. The country's population stood at 126 million
as of January 1998.

<HEADLINE> 2 Remains Believed to Be US Servicemen Found in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Two remains believed to be
those of U.S. servicemen missing in action in the Indochina War
were repatriated to the United States Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A repatriation ceremony was held at the Pochentong Airport to
transfer the remains from the Kingdom of Cambodia to the United
States. Lt. Gen. Pol Saroeun, chairman of the Cambodian POW/MIA
Committee, and Kenneth M. Quinn, U.S. Ambassador to Cambodia,
officiated the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, 40 remains had been found in Cambodia, but only
five were identified as U.S. servicemen missing during the war
about 24 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The current operation began on March 8, 1999 and was conducted
by a 36-person joint team with representatives from the Cambodian
government and the U.S. Joint Task-Full Accounting and the Central
Identification Laboratory, Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
With the assistance of provincial officials and local workers,
the joint team searched for remains of U.S. servicemen in Kampong
Cham and Kampong Som provinces. In addition, an investigative team
followed leads within Phnom Penh, Kampong Cham, Kampong Som,
Kratie and Ratanakiri provinces.
</P>
<P>
A total of 81 U.S. servicemen were missing in Cambodia during
that war.

<HEADLINE> Scholars Praise Poem Recital Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Well-known domestic and overseas
scholars believe that recently organized poem recital performances
are conducive to popularizing and upholding the traditional
Chinese culture, the People's Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The scholars, including Jin Yong, a famous Hong Kong writer of
legendary tales, Ji Xianlin, a Beijing University professor, and
Yu Qiuyu, a famous prose writer, suggested that young people,
especially students, should familiarize themselves with ancient
Chinese culture by reciting poetry, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Now the China Youth Development Foundation has launched a
cultural project to teach 250,000 pupils ancient poems.
</P>
<P>
Almost all parents and teachers believe that the pupils will
benefit from reading and reciting such kind of poems, while
Chinese education authorities want to make children understand the
artistic and moral values highlighted in the poems.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Concert Hall organized several recital performances
early this year and Chinese President Jiang Zemin attended one.
</P>
<P>
The performances have already started to attract many young
audiences who usually favor rock-and-roll concerts or karaoke
houses.
</P>
<P>
According to another Beijing-based newspaper Guangming Daily
today, a radio station in central China's Hubei Province broadcast
a lively recital of poems recently which were performed by famous
actors and actresses.

<HEADLINE> NATO Makes Misjudgments in Strikes on Yugoslavia: Swedish Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, April 6 (Xinhua) -- A major Swedish newspaper
carried an article on Tuesday saying that NATO made misjudgments
from the beginning of its entire operation against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The article, signed by acknowledged international news analyst
Bengt Albons and appearing on the country's top morning daily
Dagens Nyheder, said NATO made the first misjudgment when it
assumed that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic would succumb
within two or three days after the start of the bombings and
therefore was not ready for a large-scale and long-term air strike.
</P>
<P>
NATO's bombings have been going on for a whole fortnight and
Belgrade has showed no sign whatsoever to give in, leading to
speculations that the operation "might continue for weeks, even
months," the article said.
</P>
<P>
The second misjudgment, it said, is that the Western forces had
not expected such a massive wave of refugees and, equally, had not
made due preparations. NATO now has to put in a large amount of
human and logistic resources to cope with the refugee exodus from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The article noted that the development of a war is very often
against the wills of those involved.

<HEADLINE> Exports of Household Electrical Appliances To Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Exports of household electrical
appliances are expected to hit 3.9 billion U.S. dollars this year,
up 10 percent from 1998, according to sources with the China
Association of Household Electrical Appliances.
</P>
<P>
Despite the negative impact of the Asian financial crisis,
exports of household electrical appliances recorded 3.51 billion U.
S. dollars last year, up 9.3 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Feng, an official with the association, said that 90
percent of the exports went to Asia, North American and European
markets last year, and the top five profit-earning products were
electric fans, air conditioners, microwave ovens, toasters and
food processing equipment.
</P>
<P>
According to a new report by the China Administration of Light
Industry, with the narrowing of global division of labor, some
small household electric exporters may become large importers,
rendering new opportunities for Chinese producers.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, Chinese companies will further open up
global markets by way of exporting technologies and establishing
joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to promote market diversification by
exploiting the potential of the Middle East, South American and
African markets this year, she added.
</P>
<P>
To help more Chinese brandname products establish their status
in the global market, China is to increase funds to import state-
of-the-art technologies this year, such as phase-out technology
for the polluting CFCs, power-saving technology and so on.
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, China will create five new world brandnames and have
ten companies whose annual profits will exceed 30 million U.S.
dollars early in the next century, she said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, global demand for major household
electrical appliances will grow at a rate of 6 percent annually,
and the sales volume of household electrical appliances is to hit
250 billion U.S. dollars by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China ranks third in the global household electrical
appliances market, taking a 7 percent share of this 200-billion-
dollar market, the report says.

<HEADLINE> Advertisement Profits of Chinese Newspapers Exceed 10 Billion Yuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Newspaper advertising profits in
the Chinese mainland exceeded 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion US
dollars) in 1998, more than 145 times as much as that of 1983 when
Chinese newspapers resumed accepting advertisements, according to
the Yangcheng Evening News.
</P>
<P>
The growth of newspaper advertising has been accelerating since
1983. The annual increase rate in the first 5 years of 1990s
reached 60.9 percent, and profits increased by 5.7 times during
this period and increased at the rate of 15 to 20 percent annually
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are some 2,000 newspapers registered in the
mainland, nearly 11 times as many as in 1978.
</P>
<P>
A recently survey revealed that the centralization of the
newspaper advertisement market has been enhanced with two percent
of newspapers securing 73 percent of the total advertisement
business turnover.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that more newspaper groups will emerge in the
next three to five years and increasing competition will lead to a
price cutting advertising war, according to an official with the
Chinese Association of Newspapers.

<P>
MOSCOW, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said Tuesday that "opportunities have now arisen for Russia to
take various political steps" and his government had a "solid plan
of action" to end the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, as reported by Interfax news agency, made the remarks
after meeting Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president expressed indignation at NATO's bombing
of historic relics in the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade, condemning
the act as barbaric.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible not to express indignation at this barbarism,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
He held that how the situation in Yugoslavia would develop
hinges on the stances of Western leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president reiterated his position against military
actions in Yugoslavia, saying that Russia would press on with the
search for a political end to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that Russian aid being sent to the Balkans was
humanitarian rather than military, and was not destined for any
particular ethnic group or region, but to help all those in need.

Zhou Yupeng, vice mayor of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said he believed that the promotion of high-tech ventures
in Shanghai, China's leading industrial city and financial center,

</P>
<P>
It is reported that Shanghai has established a high-tech
venture development fund valued at 150 million yuan (18 million U.
S. dollars) and each year various banks in Shanghai provide over
several billion yuan of funds for these ventures.
</P>
<P>
Xu Guanhua, Vice Minister of Science and Technology, said at
the signing ceremony that his ministry and the city of Shanghai
will also push forward the building of a risk investment system
for the establishment of high-tech ventures.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Court Upholds Obasanjo's Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Court of Appeal has upheld
the presidential election victory of Olusegun Obasanjo and
dismissed the petition by Chief Olu Falae challenging the
declaration of Obasanjo as the winner of the February 27
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
In the lead judgment delivered Monday in capital Abuja by
Presiding Justice Dahiru Musdapher, the court dismissed the
petition by Chief Falae "in its entirety", the New Nigerian
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chief Falae, defeated joint presidential candidate of the All
People's Party and the Alliance for Democracy, had petitioned the
court asking it to declare as null and void the election of
Obasanjo in the February 27 presidential polls.
</P>
<P>
Falae charged that Obasanjo was not eligible to run in the
election and that the retired general had only won through
"monumental" electoral fraud.
</P>
<P>
The case centered on accusations of fraud and ballot rigging by
Obasanjo and his supporters in the People's Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
The Independent National Electoral Commission announced that
Obasanjo had won with more than 18 million votes against 11
million for Falae.
</P>
<P>
Falae, former finance minister, said the electoral figures,
which almost doubled those of the last presidential election in
1993, were grossly inflated.
</P>
<P>
International observers monitoring the presidential polls
admitted at the time that there were "serious irregularities" in
many areas in the running of the election.
</P>
<P>
But, most observers said they were not sufficient to justify
overturning the results of the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Falae's challenge was seen as the last major hurdle for the
transition from military to civilian rule in the most populous
African country.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has been ruled by military regimes for all but ten
years since its independence in 1960 and many within and outside
Nigeria want the election result accepted, even if fraud did take
place, so as to ensure the military do quit as planned on May 29
this year.

<HEADLINE> China to Cut Trade Surplus With Turkey, Li Peng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- China would like to make further
efforts to cut its trade surplus with Turkey and there is a bright
future for the trade and economic cooperation between the two
countries, China's top legislator Li Peng said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Asked about why the potentials for bilateral economic
cooperation have not yet been brought into full play, Li, chairman
of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress
(parliament) of China, said the main reason was the lack
of understanding between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that Turkish businessmen go to China and look for
cooperation opportunities first hand. He also encouraged Turkish
businessmen to invest in China and Chinese businessmen to invest
in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The two countries can also join hands to use their
technological and capital advantages and invest in third countries.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived here on Sunday on an official visit to Turkey, the
second leg of his six-nation trip across Europe and Asia. He is
about to end his visit to Turkey and leave for Damascus, Syria
later Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Experts Disagree Over Museum Entrance Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Planned entrance price hikes for
the acclaimed Museum of Chinese History has upset a number of
veteran staff who believe the measure is ill-advised because the
public will be expected to pay more to view the nation's treasures.
</P>
<P>
A new exhibition hall featuring some of the country's finest
and rare cultural relics as well as many valuable works of art has
fired the row, according to the China Culture News.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the museum have insisted the increase is justified
saying that there are now many more high quality exhibits and that
the additional income will be used for the preservation of relics.
</P>
<P>
But a number of museum staff declare that most world-famous
museums make profits by selling replicas of historical documents
and rare relics as well as seeking private financial donations
from art lovers.
</P>
<P>
Located in downtown Beijing, the museum boasts one of China's
largest collections of historical relics, estimated at more than
300,000 items, including 2,000 of the rarest ever found.
</P>
<P>
But much less than two percent of the massive collection can be
displayed at any one time in the 8,000 square meters of exhibition
halls, which is in line with a worldwide pattern.
</P>
<P>
Every year state cultural heritage authorities allocate 500,000
yuan (60,000 U.S. dollars) for new acquisitions but, according to
the Culture News, this is not even enough to buy a rare painting
in an auction.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a bid to attract more income the museum plans to
organize overseas exhibitions in the near future.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Brisk polling was reported Tuesday
from five Sri Lankan provinces despite some incidents in two
districts and a heavy downpour in the capital Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Except in Colombo, the weather was fine and according to
reports large queues were seen opposite polling booths.
</P>
<P>
In Colombo a heavy downpour from the early hours did not seem
to dampen the enthusiasm of voters.

Up to now, independent election monitoring bodies did not
report any major incidents, except for the incidents in Kandy and
Ratnapura districts which occurred just prior to the start of
polling.
</P>
<P>
First results are expected after midnight Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Elections Departments officials said counting will begin around
8 p.m. local time after the ending of voting at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
High ranking police sources said this morning that there could
be a curfew Tuesday night and if incidents occur later in the day,
the curfew would continue Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 7,127,360 registered voters are eligible to vote in
the five provinces to elect 263 members of five provincial
councils of Western, Central, Uva, North Central and Sabaragamuwa.

</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index shot up 24.55 points to
1606.15 points.
</P>
<P>
The total volume increased to 649.58 million units valued at

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Second Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Tourism, Trade and Industry, Moses Ali,
has said that Uganda hopes to strengthen trade cooperation with
China.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when holding talks with a Chinese trade
delegation here Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
"Although Uganda and China belong to the Third World, yet there
are many types of Third World countries. China is far advanced in
technology than Uganda. That's why I sent one of my state
ministers to China recently," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our trade cooperation needs to be further promoted no matter
to which side the bilateral trade is favorable at present," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Liu Wenjie, vice president of China Council for the Promotion
of International Trade (CCPIT), who led a nine-member delegation,
said the economies of the two countries are highly complementary,
guaranteeing bright prospects for further cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The CCPIT would like to serve as a go-between to help establish
trade links for businesses in both countries, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation arrived here Sunday to attend the eighth
General Assembly of G77 Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which
was opened by President Yoweri Museveni Monday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is also expected to hold talks with
representatives from Uganda's business community to explore
cooperation and investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
China established diplomatic relations with Uganda in 1962.
Volume of bilateral trade remained around seven to eight million
U.S. dollars before reaching over 10 million dollars recently.

<HEADLINE> Rare Peking Opera Recordings Under Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of rare classic early
recordings of Peking Opera from the turn of the century are
rotting away in an old Beijing warehouse along with historically
important opera manuscripts and costumes.
</P>
<P>
The old gramophone discs, some 30,000 in number, feature the
voices of long dead opera masters but according to Peking Opera
researcher Dai Yun are stored in a tiny, shabby room and being
affected by humidity and dust.
</P>
<P>
Dai, who is a member of the opera research staff of the Chinese
Literature and Art Academy where the items are kept, is urging all
sections of Chinese society to support his campaign to protect
these treasured cultural relics which trace the history of the
much admired Peking Opera.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Peking Opera has been enjoying something of a
revival of late in China's capital and the China Beijing Opera
Theater has also just returned from a hugely acclaimed tour of
Europe where the intricate opera was performed for the first time
abroad.
</P>
<P>
According to Dai, resources are needed urgently to upgrade the
storage facilities but he is also concerned that the relics are in
the hands of storekeepers who are relatively inexperienced in
handling this type of material.

<HEADLINE> Manila Still Hopes for U.S. Clemency for Calambro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Tuesday that it has done all it can to save Filipino immigrant
Alvaro Calambro from execution in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said Tuesday morning in a
radio program that while the chances of Calambro escaping
execution by lethal injection is dim, the government is still
"hoping against hope" that the U.S. government would consider the
appeal made by President Joseph Estrada.
</P>
<P>
Calambro is scheduled to die Tuesday (Manila time) by lethal
injection for bludgeoning to death Keith Christopher and Peggy
Crawford, both Americans, during a robbery attempt in Nevada in
January 1994.
</P>
<P>
His lawyers argued that he was mentally unstable to stand
trial.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada wrote a letter to the Nevada State government
appealing for Calambro, saying the convict's mental state and
competence had not been fully examined.
</P>
<P>
"The president also wrote to the U.S. Embassy, the U.S. State
department, and the Nevada state government, asking that the case
be re-examined," Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
"But we have done what we can and we are just hoping that
something favorable will happen," he added.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Zamora said Calambro himself has refused to make an
appeal, thus compounding the difficulty of saving him from
execution.

<HEADLINE> Media Urged To Increase Public Scientific Awareness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientific circles and the
media are strengthening their cooperation to help increase public
scientific awareness and promote the development of science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
At a symposium held today by the Chinese Association for
Science and Technology a number of well-known Chinese scientists,
science reporters and other experts discussed a range of reports
which have influenced society.
</P>
<P>
According to the scientific delegates some science reports in
China are not accurate, some are even pseudoscience, causing large
economic losses and threatening people's health.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have asked the media to adopt a realistic approach
and spread real scientific advancement among the public.
</P>
<P>
Experts also pointed out that some science achievements are too
difficult for the public to understand and are thus not properly
publicized.
</P>
<P>
Since the strategy of invigorating China through science and
technology was initiated in 1995, the mass media have increased
the level of science reporting, playing an important role in
improving people's scientific and cultural level.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey, scientists are the most respected
profession in the public perception. However, public scientific
awareness is still low.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Hong Kong Toning in with Cyberspace Beat (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Science and technology as
engines of growth? Twenty months ago, many would shrug off the
idea in such a business city like Hong Kong, where people had got
accustomed to making big, quick money out of stock and property
markets.
</P>
<P>
But the traditional wisdom was shattered in the wake of the
Asian financial storm that burst bubbles. A paradigm shift now is
under way in Hong Kong, with both the public and private sectors
casting an eye on innovation and technology.
</P>
<P>
The Special Administrative Region's (SAR's) Chief Executive
Tung Chee Hwa, in his second policy address delivered last October,
pledged to develop Hong Kong into a center of innovation and
technology in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Innovation and technology are important drivers of
economic growth. In a knowledge-based global economy, they are
essential in adding value, increasing productivity and enhancing
our overall competitiveness."
</P>
<P>
To realize his new vision, the Hong Kong chief executive set up
the Commission on Innovation and Technology, which, chaired by
Professor Tien Chang-lin, former president of University of
California, Berkeley, USA, was to identify the direction of
development.
</P>
<P>
Professor Tien said: "Hong Kong needs to broaden its economic
base to cushion itself from external shocks like the Asia
financial turmoil. The top priority is to develop high-value-added
industries."
</P>
<P>
In an interim report submitted to the chief executive last
September, Tien and his commission suggested that Hong Kong need
to position itself to be a regional leader in such areas as
information technology (IT), fashion design, film making, and
pharmaceuticals based on Chinese medicine.

<TEXT>
<P>
With a clear target set, the SAR government is determined to
press ahead the technology-driven industries. In his annual budget
speech in early March, Financial Secretary Donald Tsang unveiled
an ambitious plan of a Cyberport project, which, at a cost of 1.6
billion U.S. dollars, is a government-led attempt to jump-start
the development of local IT services industry.
</P>
<P>
The project, aimed to attract the world's leading IT companies
to cluster in Hong Kong, has won positive reaction.
</P>
<P>
During his recent trip to Hong Kong in early March, Microsoft
Chairman Bill Gates lent his support to the project, saying: "I
think it's great the government is working with private enterprise
to create a place for software companies. Certainly it would make
sense for us to have lab facilities and support facilities in the
Cyberport."
</P>
<P>
"Three years ago, did the politicians here and in most
countries talk about the Internet? They did not. Today, they see
that as something that's going to create the economic growth for
the next phase," he added.
</P>
<P>
Not only the politicians see it this way, but also the
businessmen. Linus W. L. Cheung, chief executive of Hongkong
Telecom, is determined to lead the city's oldest communications
provider onto a high-tech road.
</P>
<P>
In its latest move, Hongkong Telecom forged a strategic
alliance with Microsoft to develop high-speed broadband services,
which will bring nearer the day when home users will use a single
personal computer-TV to watch videos, surf the Web, and exchange E-
mails
</P>
<P>
Cheung said that Hongkong Telecom planned to pump in 500
million HK dollars (64 million U.S. dollars) this year to develop
broadband services, one of the new business spheres the firm is
determined to explore. E-commerce services will be the company's
target in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
"We should not waste the recession, but start again," said the
Hongkong Telecom chief, "we should no longer cling to the thought
of making quick money, but concentrate on the IT area, especially
in electronic commerce."

<P>
In this respect, Hong Kong is a few notches above its
competitors. The city has a world-class telecommunications
infrastructure over which Internet traffic flows and broadband
coverage is fast expanding.
</P>
<P>
In March 1998, the world's first interactive-TV service was
launched in Hong Kong via Hongkong Telecom's optical broadband
network installed across the city.
</P>
<P>
Government statistics show that there are about 130 Internet
service providers and one million Internet users in this city
packed with a population of 6.5 million. Hong Kong now has more
than 2.6 million mobile phone users, representing a penetration
rate of around 40 percent, the highest in the world outside of
Scandinavia.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the first city in Asia to have an Internet Centric
Excellence (ICE) Center. The 3.4-million-HK-dollar ICE Center
opened in late March at the University of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Last September, Hong Kong's Tech Center forged cooperative ties
with the Silicon Valley, promising to promote exchange of
technology, information and expertise between academic, research
and business institutions of the two places; and next month Chief
Executive Tung will be on his way to the United States with the
mission of wooing more opportunities in IT and high value-added
industries for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Electronic commerce, for its cost effectiveness and its
capacity to tap the world market, has started a profound change in
small and medium-sized enterprises, which make up some 95 percent
of all businesses in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Despite these strengths, Professor Tien pointed out that Hong
Kong has some weakness, such as meager input in research and
development, lack of research centers, and void of technology
culture. Here the government has a role to play, he said, to
invest in physical, human and technology infrastructure to create
an environment conducive to innovation and technology development
and commercialization.
</P>
<P>
The advisor is optimistic about the future because Hong Kong
has its advantage -- free market policies, a sound legal system,
access to mainland market, technology and expertise, productive
and adaptable workforce, entrepreneurial culture, and vibrant and
well-developed capital market.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Experts Impressed By China's Fast-Improving Grass-Root Democratic Elections (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Elizabeth Dugan, a U.S. expert on
elections, was deeply impressed by village committee elections in
east China's Anhui Province, which she cited as a great
improvement for the country's grass-roots democracy, compared with
what she first saw elsewhere in the country in late 1998.
</P>
<P>
"I admire the highly efficient work of the local people which
ensured the impartial and democratic results of the voting," said
the Southeast Asia resident program director of the United States'
International Republican Institute, after witnessing the election
process in two villages in the province.
</P>
<P>
Dugan together with another three women were welcomed with
firecrackers to observe the election of the village committee
director in the Wuqiao Village in the northern area of the
province.
</P>
<P>
"Lots of Americans are concerned about democracy in China, but
the majority of them know so little about China, just like me in
the past," Dugan added.
</P>
<P>
The village committee is the most fundamental organization in
rural China and is closely related to the interests of farmers. In
1988, China introduced the direct electoral system to its one
million villages which are home to 900 million farmers. The system
has since won widespread support in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The 4th village committee election is now in full swing in the
majority of the nation's villages.
</P>
<P>
Dugan and her colleagues were astonished by the high number of
local villagers who came out to vote in the early morning. Some 98
percent, representing 766 villagers made their way to the grain
supply center which served as the polling station.
</P>
<P>
"Even during presidential elections in the United States, the
number of voters usually only reaches 50 percent, let alone
elections at village or township levels," said Dugan.
</P>
<P>
Before the election began at 8:30 am, Wu Huaiming, 42,
considered the most promising candidate, made a speech and
promised to devote himself to developing large-sale aquatic
breeding programs and the processing of agricultural products
locally.
</P>
<P>
Voters were then organized into groups of four. They cast their
votes in eight temporary polling booths. Each booth is closely
monitored by a trustworthy chosen villager to ensure the security
of the voting.
</P>
<P>
"The secret voting system is an absolute precondition for
democratic elections", explained Leigh Wedell, another delegation
member.
</P>
<P>
"This really marks major progress from the elections in
Sichuan Province, Southwest China, which I witnessed last November,
because voters there made their choices publicly and some even
stayed at home and cast their ballots using mobile polling boxes."
said Dugan.

<TEXT>
<P>
Apart from slight differences in procedure, the elections in
Sichuan, Dugan's first experience in China, were generally open
and efficient, she commented. And she attributed their success to
the active participation of voters.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Anne F. Thurston, an independent China research scholar,
explained that in the last four months there has been much
improvement in the methods of grass-roots voting in Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
Thurston spoke highly of the regulations restricting the number
of proxy votes in Wuqiao Village, which is limited to one out of
five voters.
</P>
<P>
"This is a tremendous improvement compared with the election in
Lishu Village in northeast China's Jilin Province," added Thurston,
" The election in Lishu Village was once considered the most
successful example for villagers throughout the country to follow.
</P>
<P>
"Election procedures in Lishu made much headway, but the proxy
voting was not limited and the election there was far from being
well organized," added Thurston, "This can result in the voting
not being fair."
</P>
<P>
Even though the four U.S. visitors carefully scrutinized the
profiles of the candidates, they still thought that perhaps the
candidates were government appointments.
</P>
<P>
As they were watching, a 76-year-old women hobbled on crutches
towards the polling booth and after her voting card was checked,
the old woman marked a circle besides Wu Huaiming's name without
any hesitation.
</P>
<P>
"It is wonderful if Wu Huaiming wins as he is the person I
selected in the primary election," the old lady told the visitors.
Her words helped the delegation abandon their misgivings.
</P>
<P>
The counting of the votes commenced at around 10:00 am, and
lasted about two hours.
</P>
<P>
"I will report the well-organized election to the American
people, most of whom have no chance to visit China to watch events
such as this." said Dugan.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the International Republic Institute, which was
set up in 1984 and engages in worldwide research on democratic
systems, the delegation vowed to render an objective and impartial
report of the elections to the whole American nation, including
the Congress and the Republican Party, with which the institute is
affiliated.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the result met people's hopes and expectations and Wu
Huaiming, the former director of a local agricultural equipment
factory, won the election with an overwhelming majority.
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural speech Wu said that he will concentrate on
improving local infrastructure and technology and make more open
financial and accounting affairs.

<HEADLINE> 2 Afghan Children Critically Injured in Mine Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 6 (Xinhua) -- A land mine exploded in the
Afghan capital of Kabul Tuesday, seriously wounding two children
who were planting flowers.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here from Kabul said that two young Afghan
boys named Haroon and Fardin were wounded when their shovel hit an
anti-tank mine buried in western Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Haroon, aged 14, lost both his legs, while Fardin, Haroon's
younger brother aged 12, was in critical condition in hospital,
the report quoted doctors at the International Red Cross hospital
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of mines are believed to be scattered throughout
Kabul as the legacy of four years of bitter fighting between rival
Islamic groups that ended in 1996 when the Taliban took control of
the capital city and threw out President Burhanuddin Rabbani and
his military chief Ahmed Shah Massood.
</P>
<P>
Kabul is considered one of the heaviest mined cities in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Since relative peace has returned to Kabul, many of the tens of
thousands of displaced people have begun returning to war-torn
Afghanistan, many of them still infested with mines.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Temporarily Accept 4,000 Kosovo Refugees: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Australia Tuesday made a 180
degree about-face on its attitude towards helping refugees from
Kosovo as Australian Prime Minister John Howard said the country
will temporarily accept 4,000 refugees from Kosovo, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Howard also announced the decision made by his cabinet Tuesday
to treble its contribution to aid organizations dealing with the
Kosovo refugee problems triggered by NATO's 14-day old bombing to
3.6 million U.S. dollars from its recent pledge of 1.2 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Just before Tuesday's cabinet meeting, Australian Foreign
Minister Alexander Downer said Australia's contribution to the
Kosovo refugee crisis was likely to be confined to aid.
</P>
<P>
Australian Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock Monday ruled out
Australia joining NATO countries in accepting temporary refugees
from Kosovo, saying the country had no plans to lift the current
refugee intake beyond the 4,500 places already set aside for
people from the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made the announcement in a hastily called
press conference Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to provide within Australia safe haven for up
to 4,000 people displaced from Kosovo on a temporary basis until
the situation on the ground improves," he said.
</P>
<P>
Howard said the safe haven would be offered for three months,
but this could be extended if there was no improvement in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
But he said the refugees will not be given Australian
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
He said an urgent assessment of accommodation was being done
but expected military bases would be used to house many of the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government would bear the full cost of bringing
them to Australia.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Foresees Big Rise in Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed
Rasheed said the oil prices on the world market will rise by 40
percent after oil-producing countries agreed to reduce daily
production last month.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Britain-based Economist weekly published
Tuesday, Rasheed said the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) had agreed to reduce their daily production by
1.7 million barrels at the meeting of energy ministers of OPEC and
other major oil-producing countries held last month in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
Rasheed said the reduction of oil production will help
prevent further deterioration of oil prices and bring about 40
percent of rise in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
He added the rise in oil prices will raise oil revenues of OPEC
member states by 30 percent compared with last year.
</P>
<P>
The oil minister said OPEC decided to hold another miniterial
meeting in September to reach a new agreement to replace the one
reached in 1990 by its member states on their production quotas.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Inflation Rate Drops to 8.7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The remarkable drop of food prices
last month pulled down the inflation rate to 8.7 percent in March
from February's 9.9 percent, according to a report released
Tuesday by the Philippine National Statistics Office.
</P>
<P>
Compared to February, average prices in March actually fell by
0.3 percent, with price increases in food, beverages and tobacco,
as well as clothing, services and miscellaneous commodities
considerably slowing down, the report showed.
</P>
<P>
From 13 percent and 11.2 percent in January and February,
respectively, the change in the food index dropped to single-digit
9.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Among the non-food commodities, services had the biggest price
slowdown of one percentage point to 9 percent, as all of its
sub-indices, except other services, slowed down.
</P>
<P>
Miscellaneous items and clothing also fell to 6.7 percent from
7.5 percent and to 7.5 percent from 8.1 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The rate for housing and repairs, however, remained at the
February level of 9.7 percent while that for fuel, light and water
increased in March to 4.3 percent from 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum for Philippine President Estrada, Socioeconomic
Planning Secretary Felipe Medalla said that based on the latest
inflation figures, the country is likely to do better than the
government's average target of 8 to 9 percent this year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Tries to Improve Elderly People's Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government said it
will help the country's senior citizens stay healthy and active
through education, nutrition management and sports.
</P>
<P>
"The community health centers (will play a role) in helping
improve the health of elderly people to enable them maintain a
healthy way of living," Health Minister FA. Moeloek said here
Tuesday during the commemoration of the 51th World Health Day,
which carries the theme, "Active Aging Makes a Difference".
</P>
<P>
Staying healthy would enable the aged to set a good example to
the youth and relieve them of the general feeling that old people
are only a burden to their families, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's elderly people, he said, now number 15.3 million or
7.5 percent of the country's more than 200 million population.
</P>
<P>
Some 57.7 percent of Indonesia's senior citizens are heads of
families and 48.5 percent continue to contribute to the family
income.
</P>
<P>
Life expectancy in Indonesia averages 66.7 years old for women
and 62.9 years old for men.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted in 1995 showed that the level of illness for
elderly people has reached 9.2 percent, with most of them
suffering from blood circulation problems (29.5 percent),
neo-plasm (12.2 percent), tuberculosis (11.5 percent), and other
respiratory ailments (12.2 percent).

<HEADLINE> Over 65,000 Volunteers to Serve World Horticulture Expo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan Province
has recruited some 65,000 young volunteers, who will offer their
services free during the upcoming '99 International Horticulture
Exposition, scheduled to open in the provincial capital Kunming on
May 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
Mostly middle school, university and college students, the
volunteers come from all parts of Yunnan and are expected to work
for a total 350,000 hours during the six-month gardening
extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
About 20,000 volunteers are based in Kunming, and no fewer than

the city. The rest volunteers will be in other parts of the
province.
</P>
<P>
The volunteers have been assigned to more than 300 posts in
such venues as the railway station, the airport and other
locations. They will be involved in such activities as reception,
translation, publicity, shopping as well as acting as tour guides
and traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that all the volunteers can keep up with their school
courses they will be divided in small groups working rotas from 10
to 15 days.
</P>
<P>
The volunteers will also enjoy free life insurance provided by
domestic insurance companies and get financial support from major
domestic enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Air Raids Unable to Solve Crisis, Says Chinese Top </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Air strikes by the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) will not solve the Kosovo crisis and at
present, the only way out is to stop air attacks and return to the
negotiating table, China's top legislator Li Peng said here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Turkish media, Li, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) of
China, said it is difficult to imagine the crisis of Yugoslavia
can be solved by air bombings.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks when asked about how the Kosovo issue was
discussed at his talks with Turkish leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader arrived here on Sunday on an official visit
to Turkey. He had talks with Turkish Parliament Speaker Hikmet
Cetin and Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Li also said China appreciates Turkey's decision to accept
20,000 refugees from Kosovo. This is a demonstration of the
humanitarian spirit on the part of Turkey, he added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a NATO member, sent at least 11 F-16s to the NATO
operation against Yugoslavia, according to the Turkish newspaper
Daily News.
</P>
<P>
But it was said here that the Turkish jet fighters have not
been directly involved in actual bombing.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the different views China and Turkey have on the
NATO air strikes, Li said the two countries have some
different views as well as identical views on the issue, and it
is only natural that the two countries, facing different
circumstances, differ from one another on the issue.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that China maintains that it is not
acceptable to the international community that NATO launched air
strikes against a sovereign nation without the authorization of
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader is to wind up his visit to Turkey and leave
for Syria later Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Nations Urged to Boost Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Export Promotion
Bureau of Pakistan Wajid Jawad on Tuesday underlined the need to
evolve a mechanism to boost trade among Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inauguration of 31st Executive Committee
meeting of the Islamic Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ICCI) in
Karachi, Jawad said inter-Islamic trade is negligible despite the
fact that Islamic countries account for more than 20 percent of
the world population and 40 percent of the world exports of the
raw material.
</P>
<P>
He asked the private sector to play its role to increase trade
among Muslim countries, according to a report by the Associated
Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Jawad hoped that the respective governments will support the
private sector in promotion of the Islamic trade.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, he said, availability of smooth flow of
updated economic data among Islamic countries is essential.
</P>
<P>
The ICCI needs to accelerate the work to set up its data bank
and computer network, so that more and more users can take
advantage, Jawad noted.
</P>
<P>
Jawad said the role of financial institutions and development
banks is also important in promotion of trade.
</P>
<P>
He appreciated the role of Islamic Development Bank for mutual
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He asked the Islamic countries to take further steps to
liberalize their trade, reduce import and export duties as well as
protect investment.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, speaking on the occasion, Vice President of Federation
of Pakistan's Chambers of Commerce and Industry Maqsood Ismail
said that Islamic countries are predominantly under-developed or
developing economies, and are currently faced with various
economic problems.
</P>
<P>
He said the Islamic world should wake up and make endeavor to
enhance trade among themselves and most importantly, invest within
their respective economies.

<HEADLINE> Tourist Arrivals to Sri Lanka Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka in
January and February 1999 increased by 18.5 percent as a result of
high Western Europe traffic, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The figure for these two months totaled 85,905 with arrivals
from Western Europe increasing by 15.8 percent to 29,325.
</P>
<P>
Traffic from the Far East increased by 44.6 percent to 4,500
while South Asian traffic rose by 7.6 percent to 4,188.
</P>
<P>
During the first months of 1999, most tourists came from
Germany, followed by the United Kingdom, France, India,
Netherlands, Italy and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the performance was largely due to a greater
interest in Asian regions following the currency crisis and
aggressive marketing by leading tour operators.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's prospects were also boosted by the crowding of
capacities in Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Tourism industry has been Sri Lanka's fourth foreign exchange
earner. Improved security in the country last year saw an increase
in tourist arrivals by 4 percent to 381,063.

<HEADLINE> Petrol Price Expected to Rise in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Increases in petrol prices by
various Kenyan oil companies are expected this week after the
official release of the March crude oil price average from the
Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan oil companies buy their crude oil from the Adnoc, on
which local oil companies base their prices for April, the Daily
Nation newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Several local companies have indicated their intentions to do
so following plans by Kenol and Kobil oil companies to raise
theirs by one shilling (about 1.6 U.S. cents) and 1.5 shillings a
liter in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director George Maina of Shell/BP said the trend of
price raises was expected, based on escalating world prices for
crude oil.
</P>
<P>
Marketing Manager Ken Ikiara of the Total, another major oil
supplier, noted that the two factors that could affect any
adjustment in the petrol pump prices are the world crude prices
and the depreciation of the Kenyan shilling against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Ikiara declined to speculate on whether the company would raise
its prices for oil products and argued that this could only be
determined once the Adnoc announced its new crude prices which
are expected sometime next week.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Secretary Crispus Mutitu of the Energy Ministry
warned Kenyans that there would be a need to conserve oil in the
near future, especially if the new quotas of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) take effect.
</P>
<P>
OPEC has introduced new measures to reduce oil production for
its members in order to revamp oil-exporting economies, hit by a
recession due to low oil prices in the world market.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Sugar Exports to EU Pick Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's foreign exchange
earnings from sugar exports to the European Union market have
picked up in the past two years due to high quality of the goods.
</P>
<P>
The exports increased from 3.6 billion shillings (about 5.2
million U.S. dollars at current prices) in 1997/98 to 4.5 billion
shillings (about 6.5 million dollars) in 1998/99 fiscal year after
shipping 10,200 and 12,300 metric tons respectively, Daily Mail
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper, quoted Sugar Development Corporation's Managing
Director, Frank Kibonde, as saying that the EU sugar quota
increased through Special Preferential Sugar (SPS) concession
granted to Tanzania because of the country's compliance with the
sugar protocol.
</P>
<P>
Kibonde said there has been no reported cases of violation of
the sugar protocol provision last year. "We can say that the EU
market is stable for Tanzania's sugar exports under the protocol,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
A senior planning and development official, Sam Msimbila, said
that Tanzania's sugar is welcomed at the EU market because of its
high quality and use of almost complete natural ways during
production.
</P>
<P>
At present, sugar is the only viable product that Tanzania is
exporting to the EU. Coffee, cotton and fish fillet exports to the
EU are currently facing problems.

According to the Manila-based WHO Regional Office for the
Western Pacific, the current global figure of 580 million people
aged 60 years and over is expected to rise to one billion by 2020,
75 percent of whom will be in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
With the dramatic rise in the number of older people,
population aging will be one of the most important health, social
and economic challenges to face future generations.
</P>
<P>
Improved social and economic climates, coupled with
technological advances in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases,
have ushered in the aging of populations worldwide.
</P>
<P>
However, WHO warns that without adequate programs or policies
to promote and protect the welfare of older persons in society,
governments will find it difficult to deal with aging populations
in the future.
</P>
<P>
Dedicating this year's World Health Day, celebrated every April
7, to the growing older population, WHO is calling on member
states to recognize and acknowledge older people as valuable
resources in development. Its them, "Active aging," is rallying
call for healthy, meaningful and productive lives for older
people.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is not only to add years to life, but to add quality
to those years," said Dr. Shigeru Omi, WHO Regional Director for
the Western Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has also designated 1999 as the
International Year of Older Persons to encourage people of all
ages to take steps to ensure greater health and well-being in the
later years for themselves and for their communities.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Likely to Lose Dutch Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Kenya may not get any Dutch aid if
a motion in the Netherlands Parliament is passed later this year,
a Dutch diplomat in Kenya has revealed.
</P>
<P>
"So far, there is not much public support for continued aid to
Kenya because of the negative publicity the country has earned,
and the aid suspension motion is expected to be passed," said
Jelte Van Wiueren, the Dutch embassy's cultural attache in Kenya
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Reasons for the decision included rampant corruption, lack of
good governance in the Kenyan government, Tuesday's Daily Nation
quoted the embassy official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Although Kenya is rated as a poor country with an average
annual per capita income of 925 U.S. dollars, the government
record in governance is not satisfactory, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands has decided to substantially cut the number of
 beneficiary countries to 19, with 10 in Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, the Netherlands will not halt programs on water supply
and agriculture in Kenya's arid and semi-arid areas on the
grounds of humanitarian needs. Funding is expected to continue on
a decreasing scale over the next three years.

<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National
Committee, said that China has strongly called for a halt to
NATO's military interference in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese people heartily sympathize with the
current conditions of the Yugoslav people.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks during a meeting with visiting Egyptian
President Muhammed Hosni Mubarak here today.
</P>
<P>
"NATO has seriously violated international principles by
intervening in the internal affairs of a sovereign state," Li
noted, adding that the precedent set by NATO would bring about
endless problems for world peace.
</P>
<P>
"China proposes that the Kosovo issue should be settled
through talks on the basis of respecting the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia and guaranteeing the
legitimate rights of the different ethnic groups in the region,"
Li told Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said he agrees with Li on the Kosovo issue. Egypt and
China share similar and identical ideas over many international
and regional issues and the two countries have co-operated well in
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China and Egypt, two developing and influential
nations in the world, are all facing the arduous task of advancing
their economies and improving the living standards of their
peoples. "The enhancement of bilateral ties serves both the
fundamental interests of the two peoples and world peace and
progress," Li noted, adding that Mubarak's ongoing China visit
would further boost Sino-Egyptian friendly relations.

JERUSALEM, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

<P>
Haaretz,
</P>
<P>
-- One day after Israel's newly established national security

<P>
Yediot Aharonot,

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Earn Less From Metals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's metal earnings have
continued falling with latest statistics showing further decline
of gross metal receipts in the first two months of 1999 compared
with the gross earnings during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, gross metal receipts from the country's
copper giants, Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines and Roan Antelope
Mining Corporation of Zambia, and other privatized mines only
amounted to 28.65 million U.S. dollars, compared with 46.17
million dollars earned in the first month of 1998, Zambia's
Financial Mail reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the macro economic indicators for February from
the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, the situation
has been compounded by declining copper prices on the London Metal
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The continued fall in metal earnings will impact adversely on
Zambia's Balance of Payments or the difference between exports
and earnings which could cause a strain on the kwacha, the Zambian
currency, and possibly lead to its depreciation, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Approved Foreign Investments in Malaysia Increase in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Foreign Investment
Committee (FIC) approved proposed foreign investments worth 5.599
billion ringgit (about 1.473 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998,
according to the government's White Paper on the status of the
Malaysian Economy tabled in Parliament here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This was 3.7 times over the level in 1997 when 1.513 billion
ringgit (about 398.157 million U.S. dollars) was approved.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the proposed investments in the manufacturing and
services sectors accounted for 81 percent of the total, it said,
adding this will contribute significantly towards the recovery of
the corporate sector.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment approvals for manufacturing projects by the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry amounted to 13.1
billion ringgit (about 3.447 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998, which
was 14 percent higher than the value of investments approved in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, up till March this year, it said the proposed
investments by foreign interests through acquisitions and joint
ventures that were approved by the FIC for this year had already
amounted to 391.6 million ringgit (about 103.052 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The White Paper said long term foreign investors continue to
have confidence in Malaysia as an attractive investment
destination, judging from the value of foreign investments
approved in 1998.
</P>
<P>
It said the increase in foreign investment was one of the
positive results of the economic measures introduced since
mid-1998 as well as the selective exchange control measures
introduced since September last year.
</P>
<P>
It also attributed the increase to recovery in domestic demand,
particularly private consumption, surplus in the current account
in the balance of payments and steadier capital market and share
prices.

JERUSALEM, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Israel on Tuesday sent a medical

refugees now stranded there.
</P>
<P>
The team left Israel on Tuesday morning aboard three planes, one
Boeing jet bearing the team members and two C-130 transport
aircraft loaded with the entire equipment for a field hospital.

<HEADLINE> Israel's First Quarter Tax Revenue Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government's income
from taxes and license fees during the first quarter totalled 7.57
billion U.S. dollars, a decline of 0.4 percent in normal terms and
0.6 percent in constant terms compared with the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Figures issued on Tuesday by the Finance Ministry showed its
Income and Property Devision recorded a 2.9 percent real-term
decline in income during the first quarter, when it collected a
total of 4.075 billion U.S. dollars from the public.
</P>
<P>
Property tax collection, however, rose 3 percent in real
terms. But in previous quarters, property tax collections grew by
double-digit percentages, reflecting developments in the current
markets.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the general slowdown in property tax
collection to the state of the real-estate market, which has
been slowing down in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
In real terms, property-related taxes collected during the
first quarter were 13 percent lower than their level during
the first quarter two years earlier, and 38 percent less than
what they were during the January-April period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The customs and value added taxes overall collection was
3.3 billion U.S. dollars, a 2.9 percent real-term rise in
comparison with 1998's first quarter.
</P>
<P>
License fee collection rose during the quarter by 7 percent
in comparision with the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government's revenues from privatization during
this year might come up as much as 33 percent short of
its 1.15 billion U.S. dollar target, should the selling of
Israel Discount Bank be delayed.

Ismail said in the statement that the commission did not
investigate the overall operations of the police force but only
probed the injuries sustained by the former deputy prime minister
while in police custody.
</P>
<P>
"The inquiry was aimed at investigating the injuries and
identifying the officers who conspired to cause the injuries," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one witnesses, including former Inspector-General of
Police Rahim Noor, were called to testify in the inquiry from
February 22 to March 4.
</P>
<P>
Rahim admitted assaulting Anwar but said that he was provoked.
</P>
<P>
When wrapping up the case, Abu Talib submitted that the
injuries sustained by Anwar resulted from a calculated assault by
Rahim who beat Anwar "while the detainee was in a defenseless
position."
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who was sacked from the Cabinet as the deputy prime
minister and the finance minister on September 2 last year, was
detained at the police headquarters lock-up here after he was
arrested on September 20 last year for allegedly leading an
illegal assembly in the federal capital.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Means Business For Taiwan Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan business people have been
forced to explore overseas markets for bigger profit years because
of increased production and labor costs there and many have found
south China's Guangdong Province a better choice than other places
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
This is because of Guangdong's swift and stable economic
growth and its proximity to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao. Taiwan
investors consider it a haven that has shielded them from the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Ye Hongdeng, who came to the mainland to seek his fortune in
1989, just wanted to escape Taiwan's overcapacity and had little
idea that his Primax Electronic Products Ltd. would grow from a
small rented workshop to a business employing 4,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong has more than 10,000 Taiwan-funded firms bringing in
15 billion U.S. dollars worth of pledged investment and 7 billion
dollars in direct investment. It has land and labor resources that
make it almost impossible for any businessman to come back with
nothing in his pocket, according to Chen Mingzhi, secretary
general of the Association of Companies with Taiwan Investment,
which is located in Dongguan. It is the largest Taiwan investors'
association on the mainland, with over 2,300 members.
</P>
<P>
The city of Dongguan is home to a quarter of Guangdong's
Taiwan-funded businesses. Over 60 percent of them are making a
profit and another 20-30 percent have the potential for more
profits, Chen says. It has become China's largest processing base
for export goods, ranging from electronics, hardware, wire, and
optical fibers to shoes and toys.
</P>
<P>
Dongguan is also a producer of computer parts and the place
where the world's top 10 computer companies do their procurements.
Taiwan has moved 9 of its 10 most prestigious computer parts
producers to Dongguan.
</P>
<P>
Chen describes the dramatic change that has taken place since
he made his first trip to Dongguan in 1993, when it was just a
small town: "I was let down at that time when I saw that Dongguan
was such a dusty construction site and wondered whether it could
even produce a profit for 20-30 percent of its investors."
</P>
<P>
Today, however, he can only rejoice. He is the general manager
of the Firmness Color Printing Co. and owns several other
businesses here, including hotels and farms.
</P>
<P>
The success stories have brought more Taiwan investors.
Dongguan had 800 new Taiwan-financed companies registering last
year, an annual increase of 82 percent.

<HEADLINE> hke040621 -All Malaysians Urged to Play Role in Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi Tuesday appealed to all Malaysians
to have a role to assume either as a buyer, seller, corporate
figure or civil servant to ensure the economy recovers.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the White Paper on the Status of the Malaysian
Economy in Parliament here Tuesday, Abdullah said Malaysia is
capable of attaining higher economic growth this year if measures
to revive the economy are implemented quickly and effectively.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper, among others, explains the economic situation
before and after the financial crisis, the impact from the crisis
and efforts taken by the government to revive the economy.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said although external developments affect Malaysia's
economic prospects given the country's open economy, internal
growth factors are "more important."
</P>
<P>
He hoped each individual and the international community
understand the true situation and the reasons that sparked the
uncertain environment.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister said that there were several quarters
among the international community who still had a colonial
attitude or who wanted to colonize a country economically. "They
make it difficult for developing countries to catch up with them
economically," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said: "What's important is for Malaysians to have faith in
government efforts to speed up economic recovery."
</P>
<P>
He said the government feels that prospects for 1999 are bright
judging from the positive signs in the economy.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is officially projecting a one percent gross domestic
product (GDP) growth for 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
in Bangladesh incurred heavy losses in 1998, The New Nation daily
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Out of 38 state-run corporations, 19 incurred a total of loss
of 10,200 million taka (about 212.5 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The SOEs owned and enjoyed resources and properties amounting
to 37.6 percent of the total national income, but contributed less
than 1 percent to the national income, the paper quoted sources as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The government gave a total subsidy of about 30,000 million
taka (about 625 million dollars) last year for the SOEs, diverting
resources from productive to non-productive sectors, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
There are about 300 SOEs under state-run corporations in the
country, with total value of output accounting for about 6 percent
of the country's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the Bangladeshi government decided to
privatize 51 SOEs in 1999, and to sell the state's shares in 19
other enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Only 17 SOEs have been privatized in the country since 1993
when the Privatization Board was set up to privatize loss-making
SOEs, press reports said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Universities Trying To Improve Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Ministry of Education sources say
that 32 Chinese universities are expected to spend 150,000 yuan (
18,000 US dollars) each year over the next five years to build
better education bases.
</P>
<P>
The former State Education Commission (currently the Ministry
of Education) had been calling for higher quality education at 52
universities since 1996.
</P>
<P>
In response, some universities and colleges have begun
providing special optional courses in the arts. Nearly 600 of them,
including Beijing University, Qinghua University, and Eastern
China Normal University have set arts education courses, whose
purpose is to make art education increasingly popular on campus
and to give students a greater awareness of the arts and greater
ability to appreciate the arts.
</P>
<P>
Beijing University has urged every student to have two credits
in arts courses and it established a Department of Art Studies in
April, 1997. Prof. Peng Jixiang, the deputy dean of the department,
says that universities should place more emphasis on quality in
education and personality development and that an arts education
can be a very important part of this process.
</P>
<P>
Beijing University has a long arts education tradition, Peng
says, adding that Great Educationist Cai Yuanpei, Beijing
University's president during the May Fourth period (of 1919), was
an advocate of arts education himself and asked for art to replace
religion.
</P>
<P>
Some sources say that representatives to the upcoming national
education conference this June will submit an art education
proposal.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Identifies Public Confidence as Key Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has identified the
restoration of public and investor confidence domestically and in
the region as a whole as the key factor in determining the speed
of economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
The performance of the Malaysian economy this year would also
depend largely on the speed and effective implementation of the
stabilization and structural measures which have been put in place
in the real economy and the financial sector, according to the
White Paper on the status of the Malaysian economy tabled in
Parliament here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's economy is projected to register a positive real
gross domestic product (GDP) growth of one percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The main source of the growth was expected to be generated
through domestic demand, stimulated by the measures that were
recently put in place by the government to revive the economy.
</P>
<P>
In tandem with the recovery in domestic demand, imports are
expected to increase at a relatively stronger rate.
</P>
<P>
With the mild recovery in overall aggregate demand, output of
all sectors of the economy, with the exception of the construction
and mining sectors, is expected to record mild to moderate growth.
</P>
<P>
Inflation is expected to be low this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the White Paper, gross national product (GNP) in
current prices is forecast to increase by 2.4 percent to 269
billion ringgit (about 70.789 billion U.S. dollars) and per capita
GNP is expected to remain at about 11,830 ringgit (about 3113 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
It cautioned that there would be downside risks to this
assessment as the further weakening of regional currencies and
fresh loss of confidence in emerging markets could trigger another
wave of currency volatility and capital outflow from Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
A further slowdown of growth in the regional economies and in
the developed economies, particularly those which are Malaysia's
major trading partners, could depress export growth and delay the
recovery process, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, it quoted the World Bank report entitled "Global
Economic Prospects and Developing countries 1998/99" as saying
the prospects for recovery of the Malaysian economy this year are
good.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Negotiating with Foreign Agencies for Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is negotiating for a
procurement of 750 million U.S. dollar funds from abroad to
finance its economic recovery programs, according to the White
Paper on the status of the Malaysian economy tabled at the Lower
House here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It said Malaysia is negotiating with Japan's Export-Import Bank
(JEXIM) for two packages of 500 million U.S. dollars and 200
million U.S. dollars respectively and with Islamic Development
Bank for 50 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is also negotiating another loan package under Japan's
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) Phase II program, it
added.
</P>
<P>
According to the White Paper, a total of 4.69 billion U.S.
dollars of foreign funds has been approved/disbursed.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has officially forecast that an estimated 62 billion
ringgit (about 16.315 billion U.S. dollars) were required between
1998 and 2000 to finance its economic recovery programs.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper estimated that a sum of 102 billion ringgit
(about 26.842 billion U.S. dollars) could be sourced locally and
abroad between 1998 and 2000, far exceeding the required amount.
</P>
<P>
From the local market, the bulk of 81 billion ringgit (about
21.315 billion U.S. dollars) would be obtained as there are
adequate resources within the country, such as provident, pension
and insurance funds through the issue of bonds for which dividends
will be guaranteed, it said.
</P>
<P>
It said the government would be strategic in market timing on
sovereign bonds and make early preparation to issue bonds at the
most appropriate time and appoint reputable investment bankers to
issue both U.S. dollar and Euro bonds.
</P>
<P>
It said the government would maximize the procurement of funds
from multilateral and bilateral agencies as well as sovereign
loans.

<HEADLINE> China's Xiaolangdi Project Spending For 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, April 6 (Xinhua) -- China plans to spend about 5.52
billion yuan (664 million US dollars) this year on construction at
the Xiaolangdi project on the Yellow River, the country's second
longest river.
</P>
<P>
The construction administration of the Xiaolangdi Water Control
Project reports that 3.546 billion yuan (427 million US dollars)
will be used to cover engineering costs and the remainder will be
spent on resettling more than 53,000 local people.
</P>
<P>
Construction workers are being told to build facilities fast
enough to make sure that the dam can handle this summer's flood
season and three silt-discharge channels for the World-Bank-
financed project have been completed ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
Project engineers say that the new silt-discharge channels will
be used with two other water diversion tunnels to handle water
during the flood season. Workers are being asked to work harder
still to make sure that the first generating unit begins
generating this year on time.
</P>
<P>
This is the largest project ever to harness the Yellow River.
It consists of underground generating units, silt-discharge
channels, and the dam. The entire project is expected to be
completed in 2001. By then, the project will join the Sanmenxia,
Luhun, and Guxian reservoirs and embankments downstream to
withstand the worst floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
The dam will be 1,317 meters long and 154 meters high. It is
being built at a cost of 40 billion yuan (4.82 billion US dollars),
1.1 billion U.S.dollars worth of that coming from World Bank loans.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Thai cabinet has approved a budget
worth 2.1 billion baht (56 million U.S. dollars) to establish
research institutes at universities nationwide to Boost small-and
medium-sized enterprises (SME).
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the institutes is designed to strengthen
the industrial fundamentals and enable industries to upgrade the
technology level in the post-crisis period, Industry Minister
Suwat Liptapanlop was quoted Tuesday by The Nation as saying.
</P>
<P>
Suwat said that the institutes should help maintain about
300,000-400,000 jobs for people involved in small-and medium-sized
industries. The project would start from educational institutes in
Bangkok and spread out to provinces.
</P>
<P>
The Thammasat University in Bangkok is likely to house the first
SME institute.
</P>
<P>
"We will set up these institutes spreading every region and
incorporating existing universities nationwide. These institutes
will train existing SME entrepreneurs and new graduated students
who would like to enter an SME business," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to train 32,000 industrialists in the next
six months, Suwat said.
</P>
<P>
The budget covers from 1999 to 2003. For the first year, the
government has allocated 864 million baht (23.3 million dollars)
of the 53-billion-baht (1.45 billion dollars) economic stimulus
package announced last week. For the following years, Suwat said
the SME project will be financed by government budgets to be
allocated yearly.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Scientists Identify Tea's Anti-Cancer Substance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- It has long been known that
green tea may reduce the risk of developing certain types of
cancer. Now researchers in Sweden have discovered a clue as to how
it does so, said the Washington Post newspaper Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a series of experiments involving cancer cells in animals,
two researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm found
that a substance in green tea called epigallocatechin-3-gallate,
or EGCG, can prevent the growth of new blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
Cancerous tumors need new blood vessels to grow and researchers
have been experimenting with various ways to block this growth --
called angiogenesis -- to fight cancer.
</P>
<P>
"This finding indicates that drinking tea may be beneficial for
the prevention and treatment of angiogenesis-dependent diseases,
including cancer and blindness caused by diabetes," the two
researchers said in the magazine Nature issued on April 1.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Body Painting In Ancient Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The people of northwest China's
Xinjiang in ancient times perhaps painted their faces and bodies
to cope with the harsh ecological conditions and to protect their
skin, according to Ding Zhiyong of Xinjiang Cultural Relics
Institute.
</P>
<P>
A few mummies with painted bodies that date back as much as 3,
000 years, were found in the Lop Nur and Turpan prefectures and
Yuli and Qiemo counties. That area was arid wilderness with little
precipitation and they may have used paint or colored grease to
protect their skin, Ding says.
</P>
<P>
Painting on the faces and bodies may also reflect economic,
political, religious, or superstitious factors, Ding says,
explaining that this was rare on other parts of the mainland, but
ethnic groups in southern China and people living on islands drew
paintings on their bodies.
</P>
<P>
Ding believes that research on this phenomenon is important for
the study of folklore, sociology, and culture.

<HEADLINE> hke040613-Vietnam's economy falls short of targets in 1st quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's most socio-economic
development targets are falling below expectations, reported the
Vietnam Investment Review (VIR) in its latest issue.
</P>
<P>
The most frustrating figure was an industrial production growth
of only 10.3 percent in the first quarter, the lowest in many
years.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's exports stood at only 2.12 billion U.S. dollars, an
11.8 percent decrease compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The values of the country's 10 leading export items such as
rice, coffee, rubber, aquatic products, garments, foot ware,
electronics, crude oil and handicraft items decreased on average
by 8.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The total import value during the first quarter was 2.3 billion
 dollars, an 18.1 percent decrease compared with the same time
span last year.
</P>
<P>
The VIR said, 33 foreign-owned projects were licensed with a
total registered capital of 312 million dollars, only 73 percent
in terms of the number of projects and some 30 percent of the
registered capital implemented during the same three months last
year.
</P>
<P>
As far as the implementation of foreign-owned capital was
concerned, the VIR said, only 250 million U.S. dollars were put
into practice.
</P>
<P>
According to the English-language weekly, Most Vietnamese
economists shared the same concerns on the continued economic
slump despite some emerging positive signs on economic recovery in
major Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
They warned that without stronger and more resolute solutions,
Vietnam would face tougher difficulties during the remaining three
quarters.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua)-- China is planning on increasing
marine patrols around ports to reduce the amount of obstruction
caused by illegal fishing.
</P>
<P>
Liu Gongcheng, deputy director of the China Maritime Safety
Administration, says that illegal fishing around ports have
disrupted navigation channels and mooring and that 70 percent of
China's ports have difficulties with ship passage and docking at
places like Ningbo, Qingdao, Yantai, Dalian, and Shantou.
</P>
<P>
Ports are not alone in this problem. Navigation on rivers has
also deteriorated because of uncalled for sand dredging on
riverbeds and river banks.

<HEADLINE> Wizards Fire Coach Bickerstaff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Bernie Bickerstaff became the
fourth NBA coach this season to lose his job today after guiding
the Washington Wizards to a disappointing 13-19 start.
</P>
<P>
Bickerstaff, 55, will be replaced on an interim basis by
assistant Jim Brovelli, while Mike Brown and John Outlaw will
remain on the staff.
</P>
<P>
General manager Wes Unseld said he would not reveal who is
under consideration for the permanent post.
</P>
<P>
"I felt this team wasn't moving in the direction that we
anticipated," Unseld said. "This is one of the toughest decisions
that I've had to make, but it was my feeling that a change was
necessary at this time."
</P>
<P>
Bickerstaff was 77-71 with the Wizards, whom he took over
February 10, 1997, when he stepped down as general manager of the
Denver Nuggets following the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, he directed Washington to its first playoff appearance
in nine years. Last season, he guided the Wizards to a 42-40 mark,
just shy of a postseason berth.
</P>
<P>
He was an assistant with the club from 1973-85 before taking
over as coach of the Seattle SuperSonics. In five years with
Seattle, Bickerstaff produced three playoff appearances, including
a trip to the Western Conference finals in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Bickerstaff coached the Nuggets for the final 32 games of the
1994-95 season, guiding them to the playoffs. Denver dropped off
to 35-47 the next season and was 4-9 in 1996-97 before he
relinquished coaching to become general manager.
</P>
<P>
His career NBA coaching record is 338-348. The Wizards are in
11th place in the Eastern Conference, 4 1/2 games behind the New
York Knicks for the eighth and final playoff berth. They are just
a half-game ahead of the Charlotte Hornets.

<P>
YANGON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's State Internal Revenue
Department collected a total of 135 million U.S. dollars of taxes
in the first 10 months of 1998, an 81.2 percent increase over the
same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The percentage received from commercial tax, income tax, profit
tax, lottery revenue and postal revenue were 53.49, 28, 8.4, 8.07

Business News magazine.
</P>
<P>
Of the taxes, 57 percent were from the government sector, 42
percent the private sector and 1 percent the cooperative sector.
</P>

To reduce the impact of the Asian financial crisis, the Myanmar
government adopted some new policies to collect taxes in the
country in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Exemption of customs duties on the import of agricultural
implements, including related machinery, pesticide and fertilizer,
</P>
<P>
was among the measures taken in an effort to promote
agricultural development.

currency, if included in the proceeds of sale or total proceeds
of sale received by any person from any production and sale of
goods or from any trading work of purchase and sale of goods.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Minnesota's Kevin Garnett edged
New Jersey's Kendall Gill today for NBA Player of the Week honors
for games played Monday, March 29, through Sunday, April 4.
</P>
<P>
Garnett led the Timberwolves to a 3-0 record by averaging 24.7
points, 8.6 rebounds, and 6.3 assists per game, while shooting 37-

He led the team in scoring three times and in rebounding twice,
and ranked third in field-goal percentage, fourth in scoring and
tied for 16th in assists among league leaders for the week.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Germans Stage Demonstration Against NATO Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- People throughout Germany launched a
full-scale demonstration during Easter to protest NATO's bombing
of Yugoslavia and demand a political solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 50,000 demonstrators have taken part in the anti-
war demonstration beginning on April 2, the largest since the Gulf
War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
People in some 150 cities, including Berlin, Frankfurt and
Hamburg, staged large-scale demonstrations to protest NATO's
continued air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
On Monday alone, more than 10,000 demonstrators took to the
street to condemn NATO raids and demand a swift end to such a "
serious violation" of international law.
</P>
<P>
Raising high slogans reading "bombing causes humanitarian
calamity" and "no force," the demonstrators demanded NATO end its
air strikes immediately.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators believed the German government's decision to send
troops to join NATO's raids was against the Constitution and the
rules of international law.
</P>
<P>
Only when the interests of ethnic Albanians and Serbs are taken
into consideration can a solution to the Kosovo crisis be reached,
demonstrators said.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the demonstration pledged to continue this kind
of peace-promoting activities till NATO ends its air strikes
against Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
With the escalation of NATO air strikes and the worsening
refugee issue, voices against NATO strikes have become strong in
Germany.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs Of Macao SAR Basic Law (13) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Will the capitalist system be changed after 50 years following
Macao's return to China?
</P>
<P>
The commitment made by the Chinese government that Macao policy
will remain unchanged for 50 years as stated in the Sino-
Portuguese Joint Declaration is codified in law in Article 5 of
the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Viewed as a whole, "one country, two systems" should not be
regarded just as a policy expedient. Rather, it is a fundamental
policy that meets the need arising in China's reform and opening
up program and the long-term interest of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
Just as China's reform and opening-up policy will remain
unchanged, so will the policy of "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping had this to say: "Fifty years is just a way of
putting it. There will be no change 50 years later. There should
be no change in the first 50-year period. After the 50-year period,
there will be no need for the change."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, to say that the general policy will not change does
not mean that there should be no change in the concrete social
structure.
</P>
<P>
In philosophical terms, change is eternal and absolute whereas
the status quo is relative and transient. The key question there
is whether the change will be for the better or for the worse.
</P>
<P>
Any change that helps maintain Macao's prosperity and stability
and advances social progress will be welcomed and even urged by
the people of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Besides, many articles of the Basic Law have opened up broad
prospects for social progress and development in Macao.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the Basic Law takes an incremental approach with
regard to Macao's political institution, thus providing a reliable
legal guarantee for promoting the growth of democratic
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The MSAR is also authorized by the central government to
exercise, according to the Basic Law, a high degree of autonomy
regarding other social systems in Macao.
</P>
<P>
It may decide on its own economic, cultural, educational and
other policies. These provisions will enable the MSAR to adjust
and improve its policies in response to social changes.
</P>
<P>
It can be said with certainty that the "unchanged for 50 years"
policy will in no way hinder social progress in Macao. On the
contrary, the social stability guaranteed by this policy will be a
powerful driving force behind social progress in Macao.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of Macao SAR Basic Law (14) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Following is Part 14 of a question
and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
Who owns the land and natural resources in the MSAR?
</P>
<P>
According to Article 7 of the Basic Law, the land and natural
resources within the MSAR shall be State property, except for the
private land recognized as such according to the laws in force
before the establishment of the MSAR.
</P>
<P>
This provision is consistent with the legislative principle set
forth in China's Constitution concerning state ownership of land
and resources. It is also an important symbol of China's
resumption of sovereignty over Macao.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, considering that the policy of "one country,
two systems" will be practiced in Macao, and with a view to
ensuring a high degree of autonomy in the MSAR, it is also
provided for in the same article that the Government of the MSAR
shall be responsible for the management, use and development of
land and natural resources in the Region and for their lease or
grant to individuals or legal persons for use or development.
</P>
<P>
The revenues derived therefrom shall be exclusively at the
disposal of the Government of the Region.
</P>
<P>
Land revenues shall be an important source of revenue of the
MSAR. According to Annex II to the Sino-Portuguese Joint
Declaration, all revenues obtained by the Portuguese Macao
Government from granting new leases during the transition shall,
after deduction of the average cost of land development, be shared
equally between the Portuguese Macao Government and the future
MSAR Government.
</P>
<P>
The first part of revenues shall be used for financing land
development and public works in Macao while the second part shall
be temporarily put in trust of the Chinese Office of Sino-
Portuguese Land Group to be later handed over to the Government of
the MSAR.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics currently available, by the time the
MSAR is established, the land reserve fund transferred to it will
reach 10 billion pataca (Macao's currency). This will be a
valuable asset for the MSAR.
</P>
<P>
Thus, it can be seen that Article 7 of the Basic Law on land
and natural resources in Macao both upholds the principle of
national unification and provides a reliable financial guarantee
for the economic development of the MSAR.

<HEADLINE> hke040605 - Philippines Plans to Develop an Early Warning System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is trying to
develop an early warning system (EWS) to detect balance of payment
(BoP) crises and prevent another financial crisis, the Business
World newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a report released by the Philippine
Institute for Development Studies (PIDS) as saying that the
development of an EWS should be seriously considered since
conditions for a financial crisis vary from country to country and
the Philippines should constantly monitor local conditions to
avert any financial crisis from within.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the EWS should allow policy makers to
determine when the economy is becoming fragile.
</P>
<P>
The report said one way to facilitate this is to compress the
various economic indicators into one composite index, making it
easier to track the economy's movement vis-a-vis those of other
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Given the traditional methods of monitoring, the EWS should be
made part of wider system of monitoring and surveillance," the
report said, adding that the indicators to be used in the EWS
should be in harmony with those of other countries.
</P>
<P>
The PIDS is expected to meet with various government experts
this month to discuss the basics of an EWS for the financial
sector, the report said.

<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- It will not be long before Beijing
residents can fulfill the dream of having a dustless Spring, as
officials vow to plan more trees in North China.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to create a clean environment in North China,
especially for Beijing and Tianjin, the two most important cities
in this area," Gong Jinling, a senior official from the State
Forestry Administration (SFA), was quoted as saying by China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The government is enthusiastic about the Beijing-Tianjin
Afforestation Project (BTAP), which starts in Zhangjiakou all the
way to Qinhuangdao in Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
"So far, we have completed the planned afforestation on more
than 50 percent of the total 60 million mu (4 million hectares)
and invested more than 400 million yuan (48.2 million U.S. dollars)
," said Chen Jianwu, director of the Beijing-Tianjin Afforestation
Project Division with SFA.
</P>
<P>
Other similar major programs under way in China focus on the
shelterbelt systems in the "Three-North" region, the area along
the Yangtze River, and the plains and the coastal areas of China.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Cases Increase in Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, April 5 (Xinhua)-- Three people have died and
205 cases of cholera have been reported since April 4 in Paranagua
city, Parana State, northeastern Brazil, local health authorities
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Health authorities also claim the source of the contagion was
spread from other Brazilian states by workers who travel from one
region to another.
</P>
<P>
Another source of contagion is reportedly from spoiled food,
primarily fish gathered in rivers close to the city. The rivers
have been severely contaminated since the middle of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
To halt the spread of the sickness, the town council announced
the temporary closure of markets that sell fish and crustaceans.
</P>
<P>
The city's mayor, Mario Roque, promised that the families
depending on the sale of fish would receive 140 reales (around 75
dollars) during the prohibition.
</P>
<P>
The local government has set up a commission to inform and
advise inhabitants of risk zones and to limit the presence of
workers from other states.

<HEADLINE> Italy Urges International Community to Normalize Relations With Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Italy urged on Monday the
international community to normalize relations with Libya
following its handing over of two suspects accused of the 1988
Lockerbie Bombing.
</P>
<P>
"The positive outcome of the event creates the conditions for
Libya to be fully re-inserted into the international community so
that it can play its role in maintaining stability in the
Mediterranean and Middle East region," the Italian Foreign
Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The transfer of the suspects to the Netherlands for trial is "
an important event which confirms Libya's wish to work for the
normalization of its relations with the international community,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
Although the United Nations, the governments of South Africa
and Saudi Arabia had been the key protagonists in the breakthrough
of the event, Italy had also played a role in it, the ministry
said, adding that Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini had been
present in the transferring ceremony of the two suspects in Libya
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
"Italy worked constantly to promote a positive outcome of the
event, encouraging the Libyan government to comply with the U.N.
resolutions regarding the Lockerbie case," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
An American Pan-American airliner was bombed up over the
Scottish town of Lockerbie in December of 1988, killing 270 people,
including all the passengers on board and some people on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the U.S. accused that two Libyan agents, Abdel
Basset al-Megrahi and Al-Amin Khalifa Fahima, planted the bomb.
</P>
<P>
After years of mediation by the international community, Libya
agreed to extradite the two suspects to face a Scottish trial set
in the Netherlands.

Monday decided to lower its interest rate, the Selic Rate, from 42
percent to 39.5 percent as from Tuesday,the country's stock
market logged a notable rise in Monday's business.

JAKARTA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian former vice president
Try Sutrisno officially joined an opposition party led by former
defense and security minister Edi Sudradjat, the Indonesian
Observer reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Try, current chairman of the Retired Military Personnel
Association (Pepabri), was made a member of the Justice and Unity
Party (PKP) at a special ceremony here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Try, formerly a member of the ruling Golkar Party, said he
shifted allegiance to the PKP as an honorary member because the
new party's goals are similar to those of Pepabri.
</P>
<P>
He said Pepabri will remain neutral and has no structural links
to any political parties.
</P>
<P>
Try described Pepabri as an independent "social organization,"
which only has functional relations with other groups, including
political parties.
</P>
<P>
He said Pepabri's organizational rules have been changed during
the current reform era, as the group is no longer loyal to Golkar.
</P>
<P>
Under autocratic rule of former president Soeharto, Pepabri
members and their spouses and relatives voted for Golkar in past
elections.
</P>
<P>
PKP leader Edi Sudradjat, also a former Golkar member, was
defeated by State Secretary Akbar Tanjung in a Golkar leadership
race last year. The former defense and security minister later
founded the PKP with several other ex-cabinet members.

BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Beijing vows to accelerate case
settlements and eliminate the backlog this year, China Daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"This campaign is a necessary follow-up of our tremendous
efforts last year," Zheng Gang, vice-president of the Beijing
Higher People's Court, said April 5 at a conference setting goals
and the schedule for this campaign.
</P>
<P>
"We expect to consolidate our achievements and complete the
remaining tasks," Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
In September last year, Beijing kicked off a four-month
campaign to reduce the number of unenforced court decisions, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The court has cleared 75 percent of the 9,882 unenforced court
decisions accumulated by the end of last July, recuperating 6.209
billion yuan (748 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The campaign largely reduced the number of complaints about the
problem in the Chinese capital, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, by the end of this March, the number of cases was
already reaching 10,660.
</P>
<P>
"That shows that our work did not curb the trend and more
people defy the court's decisions," Zheng said in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"Effective measures must be adopted as soon as possible or the
number will reach 45,000, involving 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion U.
S. dollars), by the end of this year," the newspaper said.

LISBON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Portugal will be one of the most
rapidly aging countries in the world by the year 2010, when the
ratio of the population below 16 to those above 55 reaches 93 to
100, according to an official statistics released Monday.
</P>
<P>
Portugal State Statistics Bureau said in a population survey
that births decreased nearly a quarter from 191,000 in 1981 to 152,
000 in 1997. In the same period,the growth rate of minors and
children also decreased, posing less than 0.058 percent growth
from 1991 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
Population experts pointed out that the reason for the aging
population in Portugal is because young people marry late, give
birth late and sterile patients are on increase.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, about 4.1 million babies were born in
1998 in the European Union countries, decreasing 40,000 from 1997.
The population ratio between the young and the old in these
countries was 124 to 100 in 1997.

<HEADLINE> hke040609 - Indonesia Cocoa Output May Reach 500,000 Tons in 2005 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's annual cocoa output
may reach between 450,000 and 500,000 tons by 2005 as plantation
area expands, the Indonesian Observer reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"As prices improve, there has been spontaneous expansion of
plantation areas by farmers. Productivity of the existing cocoa
trees is also expected to improve," said P.S. Siswoputranto,
executive director of the Indonesian Cocoa Association.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is the world's third largest cocoa producer after
Cote d' Ivoire and Ghana.
</P>
<P>
Prices of Indonesian cocoa beans have drastically increased
because of the rupiah currency's depreciation during the regional
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Before the crisis started in 1997, a kilogram of beans was
priced at 3,300/3,500 rupiah per kilogram. Current prices are
8,500 rupiah (about one U.S. dollar) per kilogram in Ujungpandang,
the provincial capital of the key growing area of South Sulawesi.
</P>
<P>
Litha Brent, chairman of the cocoa association, said
Indonesia's cocoa output could reach 325,000 tons in 1999 against
310,000 tons in 1998 because of the expansion of plantation areas
in Sumatera, Sulawesi, Java and Kalimantan.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Many Chinese urban residents do
not make full use of their personal computers, according to a
survey conducted among 30,000 students in Tianjin Municipality.
</P>
<P>
The students were selected from 26 local middle schools and the
survey discovered that only 1,171 of them own computers but do not
use them fully.
</P>
<P>
As many as 31 percent said they often play computer games, with
19 percent surfing the Internet while 25 percent say their
computers are used by parents.
</P>
<P>
The survey also revealed that a further 1,627 students hope to
own personal computers in the future. In most cases this will be a
reward from parents for studying hard or gaining high marks in
examinations. Only a few families intend to buy a personal
computer to improve their children's scientific knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Chinese education experts believe that Chinese families still
don't appreciate how computers can help children study and boost
their level of education.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that eight percent of Chinese urban families
have personal computers.

LAGOS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Barcelona reserve striker Gabriel
Garcia scored twice in the first half to help Spain beat Brazil 2-
0 in the World Youth Championship on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The United States defeated England 1-0 while Mali shocked 1997
runners-up Uruguay 2-1 with a goal in the last minute.
</P>
<P>
Zambia and Cameroon both came from behind to beat Honduras and
Japan respectively.
</P>
<P>
Garcia put Spain ahead with well-taken goals in the 16th and 33
rd minute. Brazil's best player was goalkeeper Fabio who made a
string of excellent saves to avoid further humiliation.
</P>
<P>
Mali's hero was Mahamadou Dissa who stunned the Uruguayans when
he cut in from the left, shook off his marker with a dummy and
then flicked the ball over goalkeeper Hector Carini in the 89th
minute.
</P>
<P>
Bernard Makufi scored two long-range goals in either side of
halftime to give Zambia a 4-3 win over Honduras in a group F game
in Calabar.

Cameroon came from behind to beat Japan 2-1 in a group E match
in Kano, Gaspard Komol scoring both their goals after Naohiro
Takajara had put the Asians ahead.
</P>
<P>
Dan Califf's 10th minute goal was enough to give the United
States a 1-0 win over England in a group E match in Kano while

<HEADLINE> U.S. Finds Dumping of Stainless Steel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government said on
Monday that steel producers from five countries and Taiwan
province of China illegally dumped some stainless steel in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department ruling represents the latest in a
string of victories for the U.S. steel industry, which has yet to
lose a key ruling in trade complaints filed to combat low-priced
imports.
</P>
<P>
Ten U.S. manufacturers sought tariffs a year ago, accusing
Canada, India, Japan, South Korea, Spain and Taiwan of dumping
stainless steel round wire in the U.S. market at prices below
production costs or home-market prices.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of stainless round wire from those producers would be
subject to tariffs of as much as 36 percent if an independent
fact-finding agency determines that their pricing practices have
injured or could injure U.S. producers.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. International Trade Commission is to rule by mid-May
on whether round wire dumping has or could hurt the U.S. industry.
That's the last step before tariffs are imposed.
</P>
<P>
Stainless steel round wire, used to produce springs, wire rope
and fasteners in construction and other applications, represents a
small portion of the overall steel industry.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. domestic industry sells a total of 300 million U.S.
dollars of stainless steel round wire a year, while imports amount
to 100 million dollars. Producers accused of dumping account for
one-third of all imports.
</P>
<P>
A crucial decision covering the most common steel product,
hot-rolled carbon steel, is due this month. The Commerce
Department already has found evidence of dumping by Japan, Russia
and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Japan and Brazil face steel tariffs in the hot-rolled case,
while Russia has agreed to curb exports instead of similar
tariffs. A U.S. comment period for implementing the Russian
agreement closed Monday.
</P>
<P>
The government already has imposed tariffs on stainless wire
rod, the precursor to round wire, and has found several producers
guilty of dumping stainless plates in coils, which could lead to
more tariffs if injury is proven. Other complaints are pending.

<HEADLINE> NATO Plans to Wage Close-rang Attack against Yugoslav </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen said on Monday that NATO would wage a close-range
attack by using the U.S. Army's attack helicopters against
Yugoslav forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We are going after (Serb) tanks, his armored units, his
artillery," Cohen said in an Associated Press interview.
</P>
<P>
Cohen was referring to the use of Apache helicopters, which,
subject to final approval by NATO political authorities and by
President Bill Clinton, would mark an important turning point in
the allies' war against Yugoslavia. The higher-flying NATO jets
used so far have been unable to make a dent in the Serb armed
forces operating in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"The Apache are a very capable aircraft that will go in low
and start to target them individually. It has a good deal of
firepower and is going to represent an enormous challenge to the
forces in opposition," Cohen boasted of the weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Apache, which were used heavily against Iraqi forces in the
1991 Gulf War, would face a considerable threat from a variety of
Serb air defense weapons, including shoulder-fired guns and
anti-aircraft artillery.

companies, and indicated it may punish the firms for violating a
U.S. law limiting energy investments in Iran.
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply disappointed and greatly concerned about this
development," State Department spokesman James Rubin said at a
briefing.
</P>
<P>
Iran at the weekend signed a 300 million U.S. dollars deal to
develop an offshore oil field with French oil firm Elf Aquitaine
and Canada's Bow Valley Energy Ltd.
</P>
<P>
"The United States remains strongly opposed to investment in
Iran's petroleum sector," Rubin told reporters. "We have
repeatedly urged the governments of France and Canada at the
most senior levels to discourage this investment."
</P>
<P>
If "sanctionable" activity is found to have occurred, Rubin
said, the U.S. government "will decide upon and take appropriate
action."

<HEADLINE> Most Wanted Terrorist in Pakistan Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Riaz Basra, the most wanted
terrorist in Pakistan was killed Monday in central Punjab town of
Sargodha near Lahore in an armed encounter, according to police
sources.
</P>
<P>
With a head money of 5 million rupees (110,000 U.S. dollars),
Basra was wanted in 119 murder cases and 45 other cases of
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Basra, in his early thirties, was also wanted in the murder of
Sadiq Ganji, director general of the Iranian Consulate in Lahore
in 1991. He was accused most recently of attempting the life of
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in a bomb blast on a bridge near
Lahore early this year.
</P>
<P>
Three people were killed and four others injured in the blast
at the bridge where Prime Minister Sharif was about to pass five
minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Riaz Basra, a religious extremist-turned terrorist, started his
career in terrorism from Sipah-e-Sihaba Pakistan (SSP), a
political cum religious party which soon distanced itself from
Basra's activities.
</P>
<P>
Basra then spearheaded a new group, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, to
avenge the assassination of SSP chief Nawaz Jhangvi.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested by police in 1992 and then escaped from the
police custody and went underground. Police had since then
attempted a lot of times to arrest Basra.
</P>
<P>
The police sources said that Basra was killed Monday in an
armed encounter, which followed raiding of his hideout, a
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
The anti-terrorist police unit arrested three of Basra's
companions who were also absconded in several murder and terrorist
cases from a room in the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
Basra and his another fellow were asked to surrender but they
opened fire from the adjacent room and were shot dead on the spot
when police responded.
</P>
<P>
The police also arrested 14 other suspected accomplices of
Basra for investigation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, heavy police contingent have been deployed at the
important places to keep the law and order intact in the main
cities of Punjab province.

<HEADLINE> UN Says Energy Options Challenge Policy Makers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Every energy option
challenges policy makers with economic and social trade-offs, a
U.N. energy chief said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the first session of the Committee on Energy and
Natural Resources this morning, Joanne, Director of the Division
for Sustainable Development, said the key to a sustainable energy
future lay in the use of the most effective and desirable mix of
energy sources with the least adverse effects.
</P>
<P>
Global energy consumption would continue to increase as
economic growth and social development improved the standard of
living of a growing world population dependent on energy use, and
to meet the increased demand, even with anticipated higher
efficiencies in energy use and conservation, more energy would be
needed, she said.
</P>
<P>
Also, monitoring progress in dealing with water issues was
vital, she said. Water supply and sanitation were related to
environmental health, and developing sustainable approaches to
freshwater management was vital for achieving sustainable
development itself.
</P>
<P>
Transport was the most worrisome end-use energy sector and was
at the forefront of sustainable development issues, she said. Also
a problem was rising levels of transboundary air pollution, which
should be tackled through regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
It was essential to insist on strongly emphasizing
environmental concerns in national policy, and all nations had
to systematically encourage increased use of renewable energy
and cleaner fossil-fuel technologies as well as to improve the
efficiency of energy production, distribution and use, she added.

<HEADLINE> Dow Lifts Back to 10,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average lifted back to 10,000 points Monday as an employment
report eased investors' concerns about the possible rise in
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow closed up 174.82 at 10,007.33, surpassing its record
closing high of 10,006.78, set on March 29.
</P>
<P>
Investors made a positive response to the employment report
released by the Labor Department last Friday. The report said
the U.S. economy created just 46,000 new jobs in February, the
smallest increase in three years and the news calmed fears among
investors that the economy is heated so that the Federal Reserve
might raise interest rates to cool it down.
</P>
<P>
The report also said the unemployment rate fell to a 29-year
low of 4.2 percent as wages rose less than expected. The New
York Stock Exchange was closed last Friday in observance of
Good Friday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indexes were also higher. The technology heavy
Nasdaq index rose 66.69 at 2,560.06, also beating its record
closing high of 2,510.09 set on February 1 and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was up 27.40 at 1,321.12.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index was up 9.64 at 614.63 and the American Stock
Exchange index was up 9.94 at 721.24. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies was up 3.35 at 402.29.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,689 up, 1,321 down and 558
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 694.40 million shares from 701.10
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Reshuffles Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
reshuffled the cabinet on Monday by appointing Apolo Nsibambi as
new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
According a press release from the President's Office, Museveni
accepted the retirement request of Prime Minister Kintu Musoke and
named Nsibambi who is former Minister of Education and Sports.
</P>
<P>
In this sudden reshuffle, Museveni also removed Vice President
Specioza Kazibwe from the post of Minister of Agriculture, Animal
Industry and Fisheries which she has been holding since 1995.
</P>
<P>
This reshuffle came following mounting pressures from the
parliament demanding Kazibwe to resign from the ministerial post.
</P>
<P>
She was accused of failing to supervise the valley dam project,
which reportedly made a loss of 3.4 billion shillings (3.4 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Kisamba Mugerwa, who used to be a minister in the the Prime
Minister's office, was appointed to be in charge of the
agricultural ministry.
</P>
<P>
According to the cabinet list, the post of third Deputy Prime
Minister is absent.
</P>
<P>
Museveni also appointed two new full ministers and 10
ministers of state in this reshuffle. However, the president's
reshuffle will wait for the approval of the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan Parliament has recently censured two ministers over
irregularities in the country's privatization process and market
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
The reshuffle is regarded as a result of a growing outcry for
punishing senior corrupted officials.

In a letter to Annan circulated here on Monday, the foreign
minister said, "I call upon you once again to urgently act within
your powers... to put an end to the NATO aggression and the
further endangerment of international peace and security without

</P>
<P>
"I have been deeply disappointed that, despite our appeal and
the efforts of... peace-loving member states, the Security Council
has failed to act in accordance with its responsibilities as set
forth in the (U.N.) Charter," the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
"You are faced with a historic opportunity to take the side of
justice and law and, at the threshold of a new century, to protect
the authority of the United Nations," Jovanovic said.
</P>
<P>
"The alternative is that by failing to fulfil your obligations
you will become an accomplice in undermining the system of the
United Nations. I hope that it is still not too late for you to
make the right choice," said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Annan told the 15-member Security Council that "the
present role of the United Nations in Kosovo is to carry out a
massive relief operation."
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO, without the authorization of the Security
Council, unilaterally launched air strikes on Yugoslavia, a
sovereign and independent member of the U.N. family.
</P>
<P>
A large number of refugees fled their homes after the NATO air
strikes began on March 24.
